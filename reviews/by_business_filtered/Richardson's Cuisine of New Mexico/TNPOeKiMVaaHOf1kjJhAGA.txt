For Phoenix, this is as good as it gets for the whole package - food, atmosphere, bar, & value.  Very charming little restaurant that cuddles around the small bar.  Cute adobe like separation of each booth, cushy seats, and decorative pillows in each booth are all nice touches.  Kitchen is semi-open so you can see the grilling action.

They had Nego Modelo, Hoegaarden, Chimay, Stella, and more on tap.  Very nice.

We both had brunch - huevos rancheros and cheese enchilada & eggs.  Both were outstanding, especially the hearty red sauce.  Green chile potato on the side too and it was also amazing, basically mashed potato prepared somewhat like chile relleno and then much of the chile is removed, except for the bottom.  Good presentation of both entrees & the sides.  Very tasty!

Service was good, and I bet it helped that it was lunch on a weekday.  There weren't too many tables in the entire restaurant.  So, of course, I recommend going on a weekday during the day.

Located NW corner of Bethany Home & 16th Street.  Blue sign in the pictures on Yelp were not on the building today.  Look for the name painted on the door.
