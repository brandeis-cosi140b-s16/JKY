Great date place - dark and intimate and the food is good. Not fancy , but that doesn't make it cheap. There's a good bar and nice cozy booths to sink into. The wait can be long but just have a prickly pear margarita and you'll be fine with it. Their chicken dish - i can't remember the name right now but it's stuffed with peppers and spinach and cheese - is great!
