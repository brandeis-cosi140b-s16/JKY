I'm over it.

New Mexican food, I mean.

Its probably unfair for me to review this place then, given my 180 on this supposed cuisine.  After all, if you're gonna eat NM southwestern in the Valley, for all i know, this could be the place.

But then again, Babe's cabaret could be the sweetest spot in the Valley to eat pusscake, but I'd never know because I wouldn't dare venture there or steer anyone towards such vile fare.

What Richardson's is, is average food in a slightly cool/mostly corny (pardon the pun) environment, where everyone is yupped-out and nodding to each other about their green chile palates.  Meh.  I'd rather be in the 2nd grade lunch line on sloppy joe day.

I will admit that its a decent spot to grab a pre-festivities drink.  And they DID hit one out of the pueblo with their other venture, Rokerij.  So, I'll give them a couple extra gold stars to stick up on their weekly chart.
