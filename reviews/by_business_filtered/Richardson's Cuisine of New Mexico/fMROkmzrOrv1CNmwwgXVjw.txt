Let's just get this out of the way first, this place makes one serious steak. As in, I have trouble getting out of my seat to walk to my car after finishing one. Richardson's is real southwestern food. Southwestern food with a lot of original ingredients and some serious kick. 

there's always good music playing. The decor is awesome at this place. It's real dark and relaxing. Big booths with pillows in them as well.  Combine that with the bar serving out some awesome drinks, and it's pretty hard to pry me out of my booth. Even without the huge steak mentioned before.
