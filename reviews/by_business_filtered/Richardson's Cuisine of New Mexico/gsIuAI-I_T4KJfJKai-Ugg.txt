Like garlic?  The garlic appetizer at Richardson's is your heaven.  Everything is good - from the wood roasted green chilies to all the regular items.  A little of New Mexico in Phoenix.  Wonderful! 

Patiently waiting for the reopening after the fire. So in the meantime, visit Rokerij - they have the Richardson's menu - it's right up the street about 200 yards on the right.  We were told that Richardson's will reopen on the corner where the mart and dairy queen are right now.
