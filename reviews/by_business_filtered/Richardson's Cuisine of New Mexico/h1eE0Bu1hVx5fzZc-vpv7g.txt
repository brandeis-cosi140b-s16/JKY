Really fun atmosphere.  Good music.  Dark and intimate.  Large private booths are perfect for chillin' with a group of friends.  The food is heavy and the portions are very very large.  I am not in love with the fish dishes.  But the meat dishes are really tasty - I had the most fantastic pork tenderloin here...  this is a nice place to take out-of-towners for a casual upscale meal with local flavor and atmosphere.

In the spirit of full disclosure, I would like to add there I don't consider much of the menu to be true "cuisine of New Mexico".  I am from New Mexico, so I know what I am talking about. (fyi - Carlsbad Tavern in South Scottsdale is the most authentic New Mexico cuisine I have had in the Valley).  As Omer notes, it is smoky and the food is hit or miss.  I came here for lunch and was not at all impressed.  However, I was won over when I came here for dinner with a group of friends.  This is a fun place at night and several dishes are quite good.
