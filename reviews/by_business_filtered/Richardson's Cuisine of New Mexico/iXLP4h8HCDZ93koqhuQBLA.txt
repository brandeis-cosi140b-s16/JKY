We arrived for lunch at 1:00 on a Sunday in Nov.  We were seated on the patio.  The service was very slow and the flies everywhere.  After we were seated we waited forever for someone to come to our table. Once our order was taken it took forever to get to us and arrived cold. Our waitress disappeared, so we went ahead and began to eat. The enchiladas were very flavorful, but very dry.  When our waitress finally appeared we had to ask for salsa!!  I would think that in a Mexican restaurant Salsa would be brought to the table, if not before, at least when meals are served. 
I will not be taking my family there again.
