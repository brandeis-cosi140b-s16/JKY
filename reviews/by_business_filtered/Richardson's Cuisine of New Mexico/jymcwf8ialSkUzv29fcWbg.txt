Nice place, can get really crowded on happy hour on just about any day. It remains a trendy place were people like to see and be seen, which is fine if you need that kind of thing and don't feel like driving to Scottsdale. Food is very good though pricey, and cost of drinks is commensurate. Star is knocked off due to bad memories. Went here with a woman who asked me out, then got stuck not only with our bill, but the bill of two of her male friends that joined us. And one spent much of the night bragging about his many custom homes under development. Didn't even get laid.
