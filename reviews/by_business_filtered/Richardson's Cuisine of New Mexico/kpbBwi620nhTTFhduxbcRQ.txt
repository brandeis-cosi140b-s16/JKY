I give Richardson's 5 stars for their breakfast! We go here all the time for breakfast/brunch on the weekends and almost always enjoy it thoroughly. Note: I do not eat dinner there, as there is not much of a vegetarian selection besides their pizza.

But back to their fabulous breakfasts...

I absolutely love their enchiladas & eggs dish. I normally order my eggs fried over medium, which are then set atop cheese enchiladas covered in chile (get the red if you're vegetarian). The red chile is made just right, with the perfect amount of spiciness & flavor. The dish also comes served with delicious beans & potatoes. 

The huevos rancheros are also damn good & are my number 2 pick.

The service is typically great. On one visit with some friends, we ordered a few prickly pear margaritas to start the day off right. When the drinks arrived and they didn't even look purple, we complained and our waiter happily brought us some extra prickly pear juice.

On another occasion, my girlfriend ordered a Bloody Mary. Bloody Mary's come with a shot of Mexi-beer. When we were casually chatting with our waiter and told him that we didn't like that type of beer, he swapped it out with a Chimay shot for free!

We love the food and they always treat us right, so we'll keep coming back.
