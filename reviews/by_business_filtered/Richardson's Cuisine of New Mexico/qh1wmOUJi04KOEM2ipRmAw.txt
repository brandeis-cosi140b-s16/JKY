I hate giving this place a 2 star review because after all it was one of the first places I went on a date with Michael (think it might have been the 2nd date).  I have such fond memories of the food and experience here I have always wanted to come back again.  Well last night 4 years later we made it back for dinner.  Let me start off saying that I love the atmosphere of Richardson's... dimly lit with deep booths so you feel like you and whomever you are with are the only people there.  We were sat promptly by the hostess we sat there looking over the menu for some time... nothing seemed to appeal to us.  Then we realized that we were looking at the lunch menu... oops.  So we got a couple dinner menus from the server and we perused that for a bit.  I settled on the green chili stew and a house salad and Michael had the Relleno Plate.  Mine was pretty spicy which I don't mind at all, but it really seemed to lack in flavor.  I have had spicy food that was so good I just kept eating it... it was not the case tonight.  The salad was really good though and huge... plenty for two people.  Michael seemed to enjoy his food although it was so hot (not spicy, hot from being in the oven) he had to wait awhile to start eating.  We did enjoy the wine we had with dinner, but we knew what we were getting because we had it with dinner at the Rokerij last week:).  Btw the reason that they don't get 3 stars is because the service was extremely slow... they were not that busy.
