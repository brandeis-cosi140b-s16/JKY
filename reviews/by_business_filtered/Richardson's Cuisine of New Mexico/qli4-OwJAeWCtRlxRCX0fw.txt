(3.5 stars)  I've eaten here three times and I'd normally give this place 3 stars because it's pretty good, but not outstanding.  However, this message does not apply to two items on the menu (which happen to be two of my favorite things in the world): chili and cheese enchiladas.  The chili is really, really good.  I've only had the red chili, which from my understanding, is the more mild in flavor.  Could've fooled me as it was pretty spicy and very flavorful.  They knew what they were doing with this chili.  The cheese enchiladas in red sauce were also fantastic.  I think the menu actually has them as chicken, cheese, and shrimp (?), one of each, but I just like them all cheese.  And they were good.  So those two delicious dishes bump this place up a half star.
