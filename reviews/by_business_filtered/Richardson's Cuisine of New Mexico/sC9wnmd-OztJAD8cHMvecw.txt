After all of the great reviews (even non yelpers) I couldn't wait to try this place out.  My rack of lamb was not very tender, my brother-in-law thought his Santa Fe chicken was decent, but nothing to write home about, my husband  LOVED his beef and pork rellenos.  I did think the whole tavern like ambiance was great, good place to go to cool down and get away from all that Phoenix sunshine.  They use big martini glasses and don't fill them up.  Big no-no with martini drinkers.  Use a smaller glass and fill the sucker up!!!  Waiter was efficient, but don't expect a lot of side talk which I attribute to the fact that this place is hopping.  If you drink your alcohol with very little sweet stuff, avoid the pear margarita which everyone seems to rave about.

All in all, I will try this place again.  They attract a good clientele which is always a plus and again the restaurant as a whole has a good vibe.  Maybe next time I'll just order my vodka straight up in a shot glass and get the guac and chips...?
