Wife and I really like this place.  It still has its hole in the wall feel but is very popular and sometimes crowded.  The menu is broken down to a southwest fusion side and straightforward New Mexican side.  Both are very good and very spicy.  The brunch is very good on Sunday.  Priced can be a bit high but quantity and quality of food is very good as well.
