[Review of Richardsons and Dick's Hideaway combined]

Nestled in the Northwest corner of 16th St and Bethany Home, it's really easy to overlook these restaurants.  Which I did the first time I tried to find it.  But, fortunately, all's well that ends well, and the delayed meal only made my hunger more forceful, and the food more delicious.  

And, had I only gone there once, I would be suspect of my 5*.  But, I keep on going back, time after time, for dinner, for breakfast, for any excuse I can find to drive the 10 miles there.  

The soups are sublime, the turkey enchiladas with green chili superb, and well... it's hard to go wrong with anything on the menu.... I'll try to prove myself wrong, but of course, I'll have to go there again.... I'm ok with that.
