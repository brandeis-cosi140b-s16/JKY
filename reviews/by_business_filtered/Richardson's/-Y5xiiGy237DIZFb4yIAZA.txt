I organized a corporate dinner event for 50 employees. I had not been to Richardson's before, but had heard great reviews and was excited to host our event at this special space. I walked into the restaurant and was greeted with rude service from the start. A waitress actually yelled out behind me "MOVE!" It appears that the staff was overwhelmed and acted as though they did not know the specifics of our reservation, which we had gone over with the events person in detail weeks prior. After speaking with the manager, the service did improve and I have to say the food was fantastic. It is a beautiful, special space and they serve amazing food, but the service was not good.
