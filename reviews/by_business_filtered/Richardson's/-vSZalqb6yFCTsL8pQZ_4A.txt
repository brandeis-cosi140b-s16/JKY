This restaurant was recommended to us by the concierge at the hotel we were staying at. Overall, I'd say the food was excellent, and I particularly liked the different salsas and other sauces they had. I put away a plate of tamales like there was no tomorrow! They made an off-menu burrito for dinner for one of us, and a very nice quesadilla for one of my children. All the dishes had a nice smoky, somewhat spicy taste, although I think they overdid it warning us about how spicy this were. Maybe they should come up with a scale to measure spicyness, like most other restaurants do. 

Anyway, I liked the dark, cave-like interior and cozy booth seating - very nicely designed, and made for a nice atmosphere for dinner. Alas, the service was slow and indifferent, and I had the same gripe about tiny beers that are so expensive. We ordered a second round, which came in clearly much larger glasses, which made it feel even more like we were cheated on the first round. Also, the sodas my kids ordered were from syrup, and not mixed properly. 

Overall, very nice atmosphere and food.
