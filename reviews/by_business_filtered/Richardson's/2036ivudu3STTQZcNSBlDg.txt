Whenever we're in Phoenix, we make at least one stop at Richardson's. This is our go-to place for New Mexican food. The chiles here are killer, red or green. The New Mexico enchiladas are the perfect chile delivery system. (They'll give you red & green on same plate, but we're partial to the red.) Combined with daily happy hour until 6, what's not to like?

Btw, roasted garlic plate app is great but definitely a big portion. It's a lot for two people to eat and still enjoy full entrees. Rokerij, the sister restaurant next door, is very good, too.
