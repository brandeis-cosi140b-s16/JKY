The food is great but the margaritas are the bomb.  I had the mole and it was rich and just the right spice.  

Our waiter was a hoot, asking a lot of questions and super helpful on ordering.  Even giving us a hard time because we ordered the same thing and we should have ordered different items and share.  It was a good time.

Did I mention how great the margaritas were?
