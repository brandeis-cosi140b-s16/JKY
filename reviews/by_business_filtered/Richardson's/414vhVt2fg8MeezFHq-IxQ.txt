After years of being Richardson's customers we have sworn not to return.
The good flavors are diminished, the service is average at best and the music was loud and appropriate for a nightclub, or running a marathon but not for a candlelit dinner.
If you are arriving from the north it is very difficult to make a safe left turn into the only entrance allowed by the valet. 
We had arrived with big appetites knowing the food to be hearty. We were force fed an unappealing dose of wrestling on one of the distracting TV screens - definitely an ambience and appetite killer.
We asked the waitress to turn the music down, she said she'd see. It didn't happen. Eventually we called for a manager. Mario was pleasant and changed the playlist. Apparently the owner dictates the music, which makes me think he's trying to win a new young crowd and neglect his stodgy older clients like me, a forty something.
The waitress was not knowledgeable about the menu. There were two hostesses, one in training, and the trainer on her phone texting all evening.
The halibut was dry. The Chimayo Chicken is no longer the standout dish it used to be. The signature jalape√±o potato was bland, not even spicy this time. The lamb tacos arrived ten minutes after all the other main courses were delivered, with no apology. They had to be sent back, they were way too dry to be enjoyed. Lamb needs to be seriously over cooked to be so dry. The waitress took the dish back. She did not return with a counter offer from the chef, the manager did not appear to enquire about it. The lamb was included on the check. We paid and left and they have lost two families who have been long time customers.
