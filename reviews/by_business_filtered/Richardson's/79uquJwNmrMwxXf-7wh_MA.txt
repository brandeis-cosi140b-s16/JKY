I stumbled upon this place through my Thrillest app, looking for a good place to eat after my girlfriend's graduation from Arizona State University. I have to say this place is truly exceptional from the hot plates and exquisite food to the decor. If you find yourself near Phoenix I highly recommend this place, you will not be disappointed.
