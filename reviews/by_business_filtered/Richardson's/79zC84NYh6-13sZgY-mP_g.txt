I came here just to get a prickly pear margarita.  All 3 were great!!   The food is covered in cheese and sauce, which is not the way I like my food, but I have to give the Manager Mario cudos, he patiently listened to our complaints and did not charge my friend for her dinner, which honestly she did not eat.  Please had a very nice outside seating area which would be great for a group of friends to enjoy some drinks and appetizers
