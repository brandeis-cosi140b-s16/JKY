Every time I walk in here, I think... I should eat here more often. Every time I walk out I'm reminded why I don't. 

A Mexican restaurant is first judged by their salsa. Theirs stinks. Not the first time I tried it either. I can't believe there is a manager or owner that wants to serve this stuff.  

I'm sure there are some solid things on the menu, but I'm continually underwhelmed. 

5 star atmosphere. 2 star food.

This place could be famous...their food keeps them from it. Pride is needed from someone.
