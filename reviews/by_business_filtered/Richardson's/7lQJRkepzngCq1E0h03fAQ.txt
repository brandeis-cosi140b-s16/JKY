Let me get the negative out first, the lighting!  It makes me almost sick and takes a while to get used to, really dark purple colored lights, yuk!

The food is really good (try the garlic plate if your not on a 1st date).  Prices are a little high but not out of touch.  Would be a great place for a date.

Make reservations, it gets busy, hence service can be less than spectacular.
