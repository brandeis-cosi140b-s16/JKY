How this place has less than 4 starts is beyond me.  This is the best New Mexican food you can find outside of NM and one of the best restaurants in all of phoenix. The food is incredible (get the carne adovada or the chile rellenos) and the bar selection is great.  Service is good and atmosphere is great.  Fantastic place.
