After hearing about this place for years, I finally decided to give it a try. My husband and I came here for Sunday brunch. We were seated promptly and served chips and salsa right away. I ordered a $5 bellini which was on special and decided on the tenderloin hash special and my husband ordered the crab cake benedict. My tenderloin hash was cooked to my specifications along with a nice runny fried egg on top with beans on the side. My bellini was a generous pour as well. My husbands benedict was amazing and full of flavor with a rich hollondaise and really good crab cakes , I was jealous I didn't order it. The portion sizes were huge, we probably could've shared one dish. Prices were a little on the higher side, but the quality and amount of food made up for it.
