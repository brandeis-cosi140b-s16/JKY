We were here years ago (actually Dicks Hideway) and loved the tamales so dropped in when we drove by. We had our kid with us and didn't think that would be an issue, but felt the cold shoulder when we walked in. We felt unwelcome, and the hostess seemed to have an attitude. No one smiled, once. At all. When we were taken to the table, the hostess just stared at the server and we stood there uncomfortably in silence for an oddly long period of time. We weren't offered the specials and had to ask about tamales, which were a special. 
We were talking about how we felt like our presence was an inconvenience and I think someone overheard, because then the waitress started being nicer. The food wasn't as good as we remembered and the experience was miserable and we won't be coming back.
