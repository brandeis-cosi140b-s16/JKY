My husband, having lived in Phoenix for 40 years, has been a huge Richardson's fan. After the fire, we were both waiting for news of its reopening.  While driving  south on 16th street, I darn near gave myself whiplash when I saw a lovely building that said "Richardson's".  I texted my husband and 3 hours later, we walked in for dinner. The place was packed,and I had no idea what "Rokery" was.....Richardson's sister restaurant next door. This is where it gets confusing. While we were checking out the drop-dead gorgeous candlelit entry-patio, we were led to a table at Rokery .....not understanding why, not understanding the two-sided menu, etc. On the plus side, the booths are huge,  but I am not a fan of the open-kitchen concept because of the noise. Our booth was 8 feet from the bar and kitchen and conversing was impossible, and we there for a special occasion. It turns out that they serve both menus in either restaurant, with Rokery having an impressive fish-steak menu - which we will definitely return for. The daily specials - posted on a blackboard/wall was a small novel of offerings. We started with the Pomagranet margarita, which was very weak on the tequila. We ordered two of the Mexican entrees, which were very authentic and spicy. The only problem with my husband's plate was that it had been placed under a broiler and  the red chili sauce  had coagulated into a blackened, burnt- tasting flavor. Surprisingly, he didn't finish half of it......very unusual. My selection of the Mexican Platter was excellent, but could be delivered to the table at a temperature that is less than molten lava. It must have taken 15 minutes before it cooled enough to eat it. At any rate, the new location is beautiful, although when they welcome you, they need to tour and explain the two neighboring restaurants and the fact that you can order from both sides of the menu. I would love to give them the additional  stars the next time we visit.
