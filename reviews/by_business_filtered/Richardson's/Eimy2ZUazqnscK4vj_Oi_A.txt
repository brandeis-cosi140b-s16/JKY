Oh Richardson's, how I love thee. Once again you blow my mind and taste buds. 

This has been my favorite restaurant in Phoenix for years. I remember the first time I visited the the original restaurant and my frequent visits to the one of the three variations, always amazing. I love the little touches,  the gcp- green Chile potato, the way your dinner comes with a flour tortilla buried below sweet and spicy sauces and is just the right stuff to sop up every last ounce of flavor. The fresh tomatillo salsa and of course the green chiles found throughout. Tonight was once again fantastic and as I've never commented, I felt this time it was right. 

We sat at the bar,  service was quick. Drinks delicious. Ordered tomatillo toast, roasted garlic and the taos combo- tonight the adovado quesadilla, bacon wrapped shrimp and new mexico sausages. Superb. Flavors are so on. Not just your typical southwestern restaurant by any stretch. I've never been to New Mexico and I can't comment on authenticity to their cuisine, but I can say the originality, combination, flavor burst, portion size are to die for. My friend was blown away. To quote..."i wanted a quesadilla, but this is the best meal I've had in ages", and yes it was. This place has been cooking for 20 some years, maybe more and still crushing it, for good reason: the food is unbelievable and the experience legit, not playbook. Take that sam fox.

Keep on being awesome Richardson. Still my favorite restaurant in Phoenix by far.
