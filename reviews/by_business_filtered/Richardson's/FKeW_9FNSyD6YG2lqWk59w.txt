So me and a lady friend stopped here for a night out a month back. 

We arrived, there seemed to be no self parking or maybe I'm just not aware of it. Because it was just valet at the front. So i of course had to valet it. Which to me is odd. I'm not a huge fan of a valet service. I'm a big boy, I'll park my own fucking vehicle, FOR FREE. But whatev's. 

I tried to bypass that. We entered and found a both near the bar. The food is a mix/hybrid/fusion of mexican-new mexican food. 

I forgot what I had at the time. But I remember it being REALLY REALLY good. We also shared a great bottle of red wine that our server recommended to us. 

The service was awesome, the food was amazing. A bit pricy, but like i've said before. You get what you pay for. 

Definitely a place to check out, a wonderful date environment.
