Went to dinner tonight at Richardsons. I felt nickled and dimed from the moment I arrived. Forced valet or park a block away. We requested bread with our spicy soup and were brought 2 tortillas that we were charged $2 bucks for. And the food although different wasn't worth $75 dollars for 2 people with no alcohol. I have no problem spending $300 for an amazing dinner but this food and restaurant was not worth the cost. Skip it and go to Abuleos. Just as good or better and a much better value.
