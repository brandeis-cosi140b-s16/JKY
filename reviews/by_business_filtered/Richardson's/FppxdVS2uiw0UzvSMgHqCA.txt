My absolute favorite. Hands down! The food is AMAZING and consistent. Very important because I want to know that I every time I go I will have an amazing meal. That's how it is at Richardsons! Always perfect. The ambiance is chill, it's the perfect place to settle in and catch up with friends. Drinks are delicious. I always leave happy. Love it!
