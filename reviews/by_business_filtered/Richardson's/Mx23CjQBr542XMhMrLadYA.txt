Love the reverse happy hour...5 stars there  Yet, my first time for dinner trying to show a little bit of phoenix to an out of town guest was a disappointment. We walked in and no one greeted us, then we waiting 10 minutes and some seconds for a server. This is after 2 people came to the table to say our server would be with us soon. Drinks, chips and dip, even water would have been nice as we waited. THEN....we waited again after we got drinks to order our dinner.  But WOW, the food was great. Yes I'd go back. The food rocked!
