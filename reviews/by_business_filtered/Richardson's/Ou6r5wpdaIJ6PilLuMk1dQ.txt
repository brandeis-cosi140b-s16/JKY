Went here with my husband and a friend for dinner. The ambiance is dark but nice. Our friend is from New Mexico and she said they do a very good job making authentic NM food; to me it was a little too salty. Perhaps that is the style of cooking there? The portion sizes are large so that does help to justify the high prices, however, I think in the Phoenix area there are more affordable places to try with food just as good or better. 
With that being said, I've only been here once and maybe the chef was just a little too "happy" with the salt that night... I'd try it again if I was in the area. For now, just 3/5.
