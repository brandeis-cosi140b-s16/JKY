This was a great place for dinner. Plenty of choices on the menu, from salads to pizzas to pastas to classic Mexican-style plates. I went with something called Chimayo chicken, which had sun-dried tomatoes, poblano, spinach, and asiago, along with some delicious veggies on the side, and a green chile potato, which was awesome.

There were quite a few things on the menu that looked good, so I'm sure I'll be back.

Oh, and I almost forgot - I ordered the sopapillas for dessert - best sopapillas I've ever had. Cooked perfectly, just the right amount of crispiness, drizzled with sweet honey. This would be enough of a reason to come back.
