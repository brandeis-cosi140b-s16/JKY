Have you heard of New Mexican food? Let's be clear, I'm not talking about Mexican (at least that's what the locals in the area want you to believe)... my take? Mexican, New Mexican, who cares? IT'S SO GOOD!

Margaritas are strong and tasty. Portions are large and delicious. If you get a combo you're in for a mix of meat/poultry/fish (your choice), beans, rice, cheese, diced tomatoes... the works. The cheese brings it all together and presto - you've got yourself one hell of a New Mexican meal =)

Three salsas served to start, one has a great kick. I can't promise you'll be able to really distinguish between Mexican and New Mexican, but I can promise you'll enjoy your meal.
