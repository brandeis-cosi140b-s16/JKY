Zero stars.

- Terrible food, mostly canned or pre-processed garbage
- Service was pitiful.  Staff was extremely rude and disrespectful to the customers
- Atmosphere was depressing.  Dark, dingy, smelly, uncomfortable

My biggest gripe is with management.  They offer happy hour specials, but do not clearly tell you which sections of the restaurant apply to happy hour.  As such, we were overcharged for our meal, and they were not willing to discuss the misunderstanding.

Clyde, the "manager" is pathetic.  He has no authority or power to manage the restaurant.  I'm not sure why the owners would employ a manager who doesn't respect customers, but I can see why they have not given any decision-making authority to this hapless schmuck.

Under no circumstances should you go to Richardsons.  Best case scenario, you eat overpriced, low-end slop in a depressing setting.  Worst case scenario, they'll steal your money and give you food poisoning.
