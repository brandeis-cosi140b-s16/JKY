This place is definitely worth a try. My family and I came here for a nice hearty brunch and we were not disappointed. 

All the dishes we tried were so flavorful. I tried the enchiladas: tried one cheese and one green chile pork. The green chile pork was my favorite. My husband had the carne adovada benedict. I will definitely order that next time. The meat was so tender and had a great smokiness to the red chile. The only downside to the meal was that all over our eggs were over cooked. I didn't send the eggs back but my father did and they were happy to give him eggs cooked to his liking. Overall, we were happy with our experience at Richardson's.

Also, just a heads up, they have valet. I'm not sure if they always have valet but they had it when we went.
