Oh Richardson's...you never cease to impress  me. I was there tonight for my mother's birthday with my brother, sister in law, niece & nephew & surprisingly enough, it was pretty dead. This was the first time I've been to the new location (hadn't been to the previous location in at least a year) and even though some lady came in & said "OH it's so different but so similar"..(doesn't make a whole lot of sense)...it looks pretty much identical to the previous location...cozy seating & all..pretty sure there's extra seating on the side as well. 

The hostess was nice & sat us as soon as our full party was there. We started off with the chips & guac which was pretty fantastic (spicy as well but I love a good kick to my food) & the pinot noir which is fabulous...best pinot I've had in a while. 

We then proceed to split the blackened salmon with pineapple salsa (my mother & I) with the mixed veggies & potato stuffed green chile & two side salads....two side salads were definitely not required...they're huge as are the portions typically served at Richardson's. It was delicious.

I'm not sure where previous Yelpers have noted they only have one dessert as we had not only the flan but the sopapillas as well which were prepared perfectly...not too doughy, not too tough. Absolutely great end to the meal. 

Overall, great experience. The server was extremely patient with us as we requested things frequently & was laid back while being attentive at the same time. 

If ya haven't been, go. It's a great atmosphere for a date & I can't wait to go back once the weather's cooled off to enjoy the patio.
