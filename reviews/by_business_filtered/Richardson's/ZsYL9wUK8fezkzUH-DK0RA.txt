This place is the most amazing ambience and food I have had in a long time! I loved it! They have Rye!!! As in Whiskey! 

Very cool vibe and the food was so good. I even tried to come home and copy their Roasted Green Chili Baked potato... I didn't do it justice, so I will need to go back and have it again. 

The place is small, and the parking non-existent, but they have complimentary valet and that helps. Get there early or make sure to make reservations. 

LOVED THIS PLACE! Loved everything about it!
