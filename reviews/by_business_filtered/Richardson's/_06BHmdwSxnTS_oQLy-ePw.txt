This isn't your cheap Mexican food joint around the corner, but it's also not your haute Spanish fusion fine dining. What you get is a relaxed and unpretentious environment, large portions and good food.

Had dinner here with my wife and some friends. It's a good sized space inside, though there can be a wait during peak times. But they have a nice covered patio bar area where you can wait and grab a drink. The portions are huge. My wife and I shared the Carne Adovada and Chimayo Chicken, and probably had a full serving left over to take home. The Carne Adovada has a little kick to it with the red chili sauce, but the smoked pork is succulent and delicious. My wife thought the Chimayo Chicken was a bit too heavy for her liking, but I thought it was delicious. I'm looking forward to the leftovers :-)
