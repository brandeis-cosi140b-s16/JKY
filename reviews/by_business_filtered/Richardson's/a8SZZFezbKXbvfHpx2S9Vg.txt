I liked the two bar and cove areas for space and ambiance.  Our waitress was really nice but the kitchen was in deep trouble.  We waited over an hour for 3 happy hour small plates - chips and dip, sliders and tostadas.    Easy to create.  We asked the waitress twice and she apologized both times.  Finally I asked if I could order a second glass of wine at happy hour prices since happy hour was long over and I didn't get to eat my food while I drank my wine.  She managed to get a comp glass of wine for me which helped.  I made sure to tip her well because the food delay was not her fault.  Everyone was experiencing the same slowness.  When one table has a problem getting their food it's a mistake.  When none of the tables get their food in a timely manner - is time to fire the expediter.  Once the food came it was a terrible disappointment.  The same bland dry meat with no flavor just hot spice was on the sliders and the tostada and the dip was horrible.  The best part of the meal were the corn chips that clearly came out of a bag.  To make matters worse, I originally stopped in at Rockerij and decided not to stay because it was too hot and too crowded.  Next time we will mosey down 16th street to all the other restaurants/bars that deserve our business.
