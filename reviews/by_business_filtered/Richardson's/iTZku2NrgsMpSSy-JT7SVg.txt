The ambiance and location saves this place from zero stars.

Food wasn't good at all, specially for the price. Guac was boring and chunky with unexpected (and unpleasant) textures.

The chips were oily although the salsas were good.

I had the angel hair chilly pasta with shrimp. The shrimp were good but the pasta was packed with alfredo sauce and no hint of spiciness at all.

I tried my friend's lamb rack and it was boring and flavorless. 

Besides the great company and great place ambiance wise, the food doesn't worth the visit.

I'll give this place a try someday soon with hopes that it was just a bad day because the setting and ambiance are really nice. 

Public service: servings are humongous, so don't over order.
