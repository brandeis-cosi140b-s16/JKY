Food is 5 Star stuff

Service was AWEFUL!
From the moment we sat down, our server, an older blonde lady, was rude, passive aggressive and truly toxic.

Carne Adovada was amazing! Margaritas were solid but overpriced.

It is a total shame when a server ruins an entire evening.
$375.00 check for 8 people. You would think she would try a little kindness considering there is a pretty good tip coming their way.

Oh well, maybe next time.
The bus boy was nice!
