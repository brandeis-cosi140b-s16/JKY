We went to Richardson's last night because we had some family in town and wanted to treat them to a nice dinner. 

They did not disappoint. I had the fish special which had swordfish, mahi mahi and salmon and it was simply delightful. For some of the older folks in my family some of the menu was off-limits because of the spiciness but that's not true for me! 

I will be visiting this establishment again and suggest you do too, if you have a few extra bucks. (A little pricey)
