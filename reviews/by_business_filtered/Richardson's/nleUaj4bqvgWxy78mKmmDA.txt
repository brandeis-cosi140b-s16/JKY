This place is good but it gets over-hyped.  Good Land o' Enchantment-style cuisine. Hot Hatch and Anaheim peppers make most of their menu items awesome.  Even the burger is decent.  But like going to an over-hyped movie this restaurant makes you leave feeling ripped off. I'll give it another try in the future.
