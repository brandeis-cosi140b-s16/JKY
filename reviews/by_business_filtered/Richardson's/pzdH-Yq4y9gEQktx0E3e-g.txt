It's Saturday morning at 11:27 am, and I should be at Richardson's savoring a Richardsons combo with a jalapeño benedict (with pork loin and jalapeño hollandaise) and two chicken enchiladas with both red and green sauce (why settle when you can have both).  I would also even have some of the asparagus they throw on the plate so you can feel that you had a healthy meal.  I should be washing it all down with a bloody mary requested to be "just a little spicy", so that it has just enough of a spicy kick for me.  Or maybe I should branch out and have the carne adovada and eggs or huevos rancheros or anything on that wonderful brunch menu.  And maybe I should go a second time to award the coveted 5th star, just to make sure it's excellence was not a fluke.

But instead, I'm writing about it.  Should have, could have, would have, but didn't.  Well this is just depressing, so I'm headed to the tamale festival instead.  But I'm thinking Richardson's tomorrow.
