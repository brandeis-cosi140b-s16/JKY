They are open again!  The green chili soup is delicious and is like playing Russian Roulette.  Sometimes it's super spicy, sometimes its manageable.  Pork Adovada is the standard here.  What I like is that you can also order off of the Rokerij menu and the wine menu is exactly the same which is nice.  They have a great patio which you should take advantage of if you can.  I'm still annoyed that they can't just give you a chile relleno a la carte, you have to get the entire plate.  These are the quirks that you deal with when you come here.   The service is friendly and yes the prices are still a dollar or two, too high, but then again, it looks exactly like the old restaurant, so the same gripes and same good stuff are all there.
