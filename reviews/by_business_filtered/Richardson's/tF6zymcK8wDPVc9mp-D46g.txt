I really enjoyed the food I had here. I had the daily special - a fish trio, with different sauces and preparations. When I left, I was sad that I didn't live in Phoenix. I was also sad that I was with a bunch of my co-workers who, when they were complaining that the food was too spicy, would have looked at me funny for stealing the remainder of THEIR dinners. 

This place is an absolute winner.
