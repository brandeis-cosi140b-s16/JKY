Still a five - without a doubt!!  We went here with another couple who are good friends.  They had never been to Richardson's before and so we were a little uneasy about whether they would like it as much as we do.

We arrived at 5:20 without reservations because for some reason I thought they didn't take reservations for under eight which they indeed do.  They take reservations for 4 and over.  Anyway, they seated us immediately but explained that our table had been reserved for 6:45 and would that work for us.  Yes, indeedy!!  Nabbed a great corner cozy booth!  One of the best in the house!!

As soon as we sat down we were served big glasses of ice water with lemon and asked if we wanted chips and salsa.  We had never ordered them before and they were really good.  They came warm, with a very flavorful guacamole, a salsa which tasted really great but was a little too warm for me and a couple other dips which I didn't try because I thought they'd be warmer than the salsa. 

We ordered drinks - one Reisling, two house Margaritas and one Rob Roy on the Rocks.  Everyone was pleased with their libations!

Onto our dinner orders!   Two of us ordered the grilled shrimp pasta which was amazing!  I can't begin to guess how many calories were in that dish but it was so worth every bite and we both brought some home.  Our companions ordered two of their chicken items and were very pleased!  

Our waiter was wonderful!  He was knowledgeable about the menu and spent time with us describing the various dishes.  

They also have specials every night written on a chalkboard.  Lots of great sounding stuff, but oh my, that shrimp pasta was - ooh la la!

Will I be back?  Without a doubt if my chapter three in life lasts awhile longer!
