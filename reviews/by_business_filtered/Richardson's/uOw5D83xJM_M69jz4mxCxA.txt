Where do I start? I'm from New Mexico, northern New Mexico, and I am picky about places claiming to serve our amazing cuisine, but clearly the Richardson's restaurants know their stuff.

Oh my goodness: I ordered the breakfast burrito with bacon, potatoes, Christmas (red and green chile together) and my mouth was in chile heaven. Wait. How did I forget? Sunday is happy hour ALL DAY until 6pm. My fianc√© ordered the rellenos and eggs and his steamy plate came out covered in chile and cheese goodness. Truly, this is a diamond in the rough. 

Our food came out piping hot, the only way to eat a fantastic meal, and our drinks were fantastic.

This place is beautiful! We sat at the outdoor bar, enjoying the beautiful weather, company, and ambiance. You can smell the wood oven and watch pizza and drinks being made right in front of you. The outdoor patio seating looks amazing and we'll definitely be back. Most definitely. 

Do not skip this amazing place. It's wonderful and then some!
