The best place in Arizona for Carne Adovada, Guacamole and Prickly Pear Margaritas. An especially fun place to bring out of town guests for a Southwest experience. Dark, cozy booths inside which require early arrival or reservations for parties of four or more. The outside bar also has great atmosphere for a more casual evening.
