We went there last Sun for brunch. 
I'm impressed with the atmosphere most.
Love their unique fun kind of foods. 
I didn't remember what we ordered but there were 
shrimp sandwich, grilled spicy pork, and crab omelet.
It won't take long to get the food here and they all are delicious!
Worth stopping by :)
