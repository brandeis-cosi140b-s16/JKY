Been a few times now and it always seems to be pretty busy or at least pretty full. My food was average both times and service was average at best. Flavors are pretty minimal and they are light on the seasonings wich leaves a lot to be desired. Average food so they get an average rating. We have had everything from chimichangas to tacos and enchiladas all with the same flavor issue.  Not a bad meal at all, just not up to Arizona standards. The atmosphere is very nice and comfortable.

The Margarita recieves four stars BTW 
Get the big one -thank me later ;)
