Great food! The environment is so authentic and staff is very professional, nice and presentable. I've been to both locations, love the live music and comfortable environment. I ordered taco plate and my friend ordered fish tacos which she said were the best she's had, my sister ordered the spinach with cheese enchiladas. All very good and prepared neatly, highly recommend this place if you're craving some good Mexican food.
