Ate there tonight and will not be returning. Service really slow took forever to get our tacos which were awful. They were soaked in grease could not eat the tortillas. Mentioned it to the waitress she really didn't care. My rice had bits of chicken in it wonder if it was leftover from another plate. Chips were also soaked in oil. Best thing on the menu was the iced tea!  Now that I am home I feel like I'm gonna be sick.
