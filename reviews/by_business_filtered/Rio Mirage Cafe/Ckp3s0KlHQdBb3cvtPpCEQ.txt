Still about the only place I will eat as far as Mexican food (unless we are up for a drive to Wickenburg). Food quality is very consistent and my white meat Chicken enchiladas never disappoint. The family and I love Rio!

Still have yet to meet or even be able to identity the "Newer" Manager (which is a bit of a disappointment) but our favorite server Ramone always takes GREAT care of us, thank goodness. If Ramone is not already on the path to upper management of some sort, he should be! He is Flawless as a server and he personality is wonderful! We never wait or want for anything when he is tending to our table.

Thanks Rio for serving Surprise well.
