Here is my tip.   If you are in the area, don't be lazy and just drive the extra few miles to the El Mirage one.   I am sure they make a buck here having set up in the snowbird mecca intersection for 6 months out of the year.  But this place is terrible.

Night and day between here and El Mirage.   Staff is terrible, including managers/owners(?).  Sever was a jerk.  Food was greasy and disgusting.  The "hot sauce" I asked for instead of salsa came in a little plastic cup and looked like dishwater.  Chips were stale.  I could go on and on....and everything at the other location is exact opposite!  Stay away from this one.
