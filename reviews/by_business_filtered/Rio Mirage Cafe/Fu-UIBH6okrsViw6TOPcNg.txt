The place is authentic and fun inside but the food was Marginal at Best. Menu was very limited. I asked for veggie options and??? My waiter didnt seem to understand. Ok I'll have fish tacos, my mahi in my tacos was wayyy over cooked like rubber. It was Monday night and not very busy but took forever to get drinks and food.
