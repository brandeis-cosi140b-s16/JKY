Very good Mexican food can be had here.  This location is a reboot of the other Rio Mirage Cafe in old El Mirage.  This location has nice seating, big comfy wrap around booths and nice tables.

The appetizers are all excellent, and I highly reccomend the jumbo sampler for parties of 4 and more.  There was enough food to darn near be a meal in itself.  

Their combination plates are all generous with lots of rice and beans, and the main dish is always tasty. 

The service was good, although I must confess quite authentic...meaning I am pretty sure our waitress did not speak english as a primary language.  It lead to some repeats..but nothing we couldn't handle.  : )

The food all came out at the same time, and was all hot and fresh so no problems with their kitchen at all. 

The chips and salsa that were served were also very tasty.  I would go back to this restaurant for lunch or dinner.  Enjoy!
