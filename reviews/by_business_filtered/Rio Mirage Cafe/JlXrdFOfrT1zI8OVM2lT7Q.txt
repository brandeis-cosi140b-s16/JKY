I use to go to their original location many years ago with coworkers.  When I found myself up in Surprise today with my family I suggested we give this location a try.  We were seated quickly drink order was taken chips and salsa were served. My husband asked for a hotter salsa and they said sure but never brought it.  Food was served it was hot and plentiful however the food really lacked flavor and salt.  My husband made a joke that they must dumb down the flavor since it is so close to Sun City.  I was really disappointed with food.  It was quite bland and the cost of the meal was overall high for what you get.  Wont be back.
