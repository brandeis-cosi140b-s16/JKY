Loved this place great authentic Mexican restaurant in Surprise. The service was excellent and the food was amazing. Chips and salsa made to perfection. My wife and I shared a bean and cheese burrito and the steak tacos mexicanos could not ask for a better combination! Loved the atmosphere real traditional Mexican style. $28
