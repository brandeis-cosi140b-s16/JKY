Tried this place on the recommendation of Yelpers and was not disappointed.

Started off with the fresh chips and salsa which was a welcome treat after a day of hiking.  We also polished of our day with a Mango and Agave Margarita- both were good the latter was excellent.

We had the Fajitas con Pollo and the El Rico Burrito and were not disappointed.  Definitely worth a look and we will be back!

PS- GREAT specials during the week
