There are many mexican spots in Arizona and I'm excited that this place is right down the street from us.  The service has always been good, and the food, amazing!  We have had a variety of dishes and haven't had a bad thing yet.  One little secret we learned is if you want hot salsa, ask for the habenero sauce and mix it in with the regular salsa.  Make sure you have water on hand because it is spicy!
