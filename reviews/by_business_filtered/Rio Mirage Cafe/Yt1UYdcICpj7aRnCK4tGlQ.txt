I went to Rio Mirage on Mother's Day. It was EMPTY at 6pm, which was shocking to me.

The service is relatively nice... although she took forever with drinks.

I'm sorry but when you are serving someone who is ordering humongous margaritas on Mother's Day... get them the damn drink!  Don't wait until the food comes out!

Maybe she was just having a bad day.

So the food wasn't terrible, but I am highly tolerant to terrible food, to be honest.  My salmon was WAY overcooked to the point where I had to quit eating it. (arrow back to my high tolerance for terrible food... point said.)

The crowd... it was really hard to judge.  Not enough people.  I'd go back, but not unless someone invited me... I would never go on my own.
