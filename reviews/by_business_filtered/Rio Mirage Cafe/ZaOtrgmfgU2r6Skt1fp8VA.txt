So far the best Mexican food in Surprise!  My favorite is the carne asada chimi!  Not many Mexican restaurants in AZ have good green chili but Rio does a great job in this area!  My entire family enjoys dining here.  Even my daughter who doesn't like Mexican food and always gets the cheeseburger has a good time!  Great margaritas!
