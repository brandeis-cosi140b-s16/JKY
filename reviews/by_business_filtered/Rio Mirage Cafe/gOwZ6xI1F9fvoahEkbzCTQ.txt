I have been to this particular location about 5 times and I have finally narrowed down their best.  The El Rico is the best!  It is an easy 5 stars.  Everything else there ranges from 2.75 to 4 stars.  The staff are always friendly and they had a singer that had an acoustic guitar that would sing for everyone.  He was cool but I haven't seen him in a while.  I absolutely recommend this place.
