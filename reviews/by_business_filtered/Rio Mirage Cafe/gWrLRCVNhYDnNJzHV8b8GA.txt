I have to admit -- i'm a fan. 

The place is awesome, great establishment, large booths, and a friendly staff...

The food is great too, if you get specific items, I found that when they say "hearty chunks" of meat, its usually not the case, most items are soupy and over sauced, but its really yummy and you get a lot for what you pay for.
