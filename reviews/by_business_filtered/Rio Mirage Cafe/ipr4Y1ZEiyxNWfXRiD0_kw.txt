Food here was awesome. Chip's are made onsite & the salsa was made fresh as well.  Legit house margarita. Good kid's menu. Wife & I split the chicken/spinach enchilada plate & were full. I LOVED the Jalape√±o Torito's. Waiter was friendly & knew the menu. If you want real Mexican faire, this is the place...
