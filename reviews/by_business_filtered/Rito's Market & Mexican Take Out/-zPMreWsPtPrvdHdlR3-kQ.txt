I love dives and Rito's nails it on all levels. The neighborhood is uber scary. There is a line out the door. The menu is limited to just a few classic items. Cash only. The food is high quality and comforting. Portions are generous. Lots of "Best of Phoenix" awards on the walls. You need a nap after you're done eating. Like I said... nailed it on all levels.
