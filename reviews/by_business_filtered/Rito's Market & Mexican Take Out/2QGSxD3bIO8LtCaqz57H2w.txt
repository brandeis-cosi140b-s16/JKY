Best green chili burritos in the valley! Enchilada-style is excellent, but regular style is just as good. They have tacos and tostadas every once in a while, but I wasn't impressed. They just don't compare to the burritos. The red chili burrito is best with beans, enchilada style with a side of rice, but you have to go with the GREEN chili burrito first if it's your first time. I never get anything else now.
