I have to say I was a bit disappointed. I drove 40 minutes out of my way to have one of these great green chile burritos...I was at least expecting pulled beef, not beef squares.  The sauce was decent, had a good kick, but there was wayyy too much of it with no chips to eat it with? SHAME on them for no chips and salsa!!!!! For $8 there was very little amount of beef inside swimming in green chile sauce-How did they get all that green chile sauce to stay in there!? We ate it on the picnic tables outside in the 107 degree heat while we got bitten by ants.  It's a pretty sketchy neighborhood, so I would make this a lunch time experience if you must try it for yourself.  Come packin' some heat if you don't want to end up like 'boys in da hood' LOL
