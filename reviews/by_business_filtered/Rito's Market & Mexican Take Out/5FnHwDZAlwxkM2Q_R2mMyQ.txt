Have you spent your days seeking the definition of perfection? Stop seeking and head over to Rito's and savor their state-of-the-art green chili burro. You'll experience eternal bliss and will realize that your search was indeed, well rewarded.
I was there on 2/27/08 and noticed they've dropped tacos and tostadas from their offerings so if you're heart's set on those menu items, you might try another source. 
I think they could get by with limiting the menu exclusively to their green chili burro and still have people standing in line at 10:30 on a Wednesday morning - like it was when I was there!
