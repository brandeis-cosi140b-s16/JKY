I got some tacos at a taco stand in Rocky Point once that were the best tacos I've ever had.....until now!

I got two Beef and Guacamole tacos. Unfortunately they were gone before I could snap a pic of them to go with my review. 

They must handmade their tortillas because the shell on these things are phenomenal. Light and crisp, excellent flavor. Totally worth the price and the wait.
