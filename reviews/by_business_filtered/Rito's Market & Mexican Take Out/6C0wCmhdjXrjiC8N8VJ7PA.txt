There's a place in Yuma, AZ called Chili Pepper which has some of the best Mexican fast food I've ever eaten. Once I moved to Phoenix, there has been a great citywide search by a group of us Yumans to find someone here that reminds us of Chili Pepper's marquee entree: The Bean, Rice & Cheese Burrito (not tm). Carolina's came close. Juan's fell decidedly short. A few other run down shacks that we've tried have always been inconsistant or disappointing...

One slow mid-morning at work we were trying to figure out a good fast place to get takeout and bring back to the office. Someone mentioned Ritos. Someone mentioned that they have the best bean and cheese burrito. My ears perked up. Upon arriving I noticed that they actually have a bean, rice and cheese burrito on the menu, something that most places have never heard of.

The burrito itself was HUGE. The salsa can be purchased in a large enough container that the whole burrito can be dipped in (don't laugh, this is an important aspect) and provides enough flavor and kick to compliment the beany goodness inside. After going there 3 times in one week, I am ready to declare this place even BETTER than my once perfect Chili Pepper.
