I have been coming to Ritos since whn they 1st opened.  I know a couple of the family members.  Although I don't go often, it is hands down the best place to get anything green.  It's alittle hot for me so I always get it mixed with their delicious beans.  Whn I get it enchilada style(almost always) it's so big and filling, u don't need any sides with it.  But the rice is also very good.  Now the meat they use is big chunks and very tender and the green chili has so much flavor but it is spicy hot for me.  Now I have eaten in a lot of Mexican restaurants trying to get that same taste from other green chili burros and in different states( NM, CA and Texas) but there is no comparison and there "enchilada style" is like no other and I doubt u will ever find it like tht anywhere.  It's the cheese,  it's almost like a good pizza combined with the tasty red sauce.  I have tasted some of the other dishes like the tacos which are very good but I wish those were bigger.  I just crave more.  Thts why I always go back to the green burro enchilada style.  It fills u up and it's damn good.  And they finally went plastic.  I have been waiting for that to happen for years making Pete's Fish & Chips the last place tht only takes cash. Lol.  So go eat at Ritos and experience this place for yourself.
