So since I work downtown every once in a while,  when one of my co-workers feels up to it, he will make a Ritos run. Although I have never been to the physical location, I have to say that Ritos is hands down my favorite Mexican food place. I always order the green Chile burrito enchilada style with a side of rice and die and go to Heaven every time! I have also had their beef tacos with guacamole and the meat is so tender and juicy, it's truly amazing. I just wish they were open for a dinner run or on weekends so I could take my hubby.
