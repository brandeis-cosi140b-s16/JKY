Green mix burro!  Different than your usual Mexican place but one of my favorites.  The burrito is soupy, which may not sound good but it really is.  Their menu may vary from week-to-week but their awesome Green Burros is always on the menu so I'm happy.  No indoor seating which is the only thing I hold against Rito's.  Great for picking up and eating somewhere else.
