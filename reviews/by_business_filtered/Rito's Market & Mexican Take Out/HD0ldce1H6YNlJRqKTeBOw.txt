I think Rito's is overpriced for what you get. The burritos look huge because they use an over sized tortilla that hides the tiny amount of meat they use so most bites are filled with tortilla not meat. If the green chile burrito I ordered was filled with meat then maybe it would be worth $8. The beans were above average and I thought their salsa was amazing even though they charge 25 cents for two tablespoons of it. I expected to be blown away by the food here but it tasted just like the food I grew up eating. It made me want to hug my mom :)
