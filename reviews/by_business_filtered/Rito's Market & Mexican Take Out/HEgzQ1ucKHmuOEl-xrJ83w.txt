Red mixed enchilada style. Tacos with guac. Homemade tortillas. The best.

I've been going here since '94, and nothing can beat their enchilada style. It is THAT good. If I'm feeling super hungry I will also order the tacos with guacamole.

This is one of those places that is hidden in a house, with an outdoor patio and no inside eating area, but the food is so good you don't mind standing in line outside in the 110 degree weather.

I would give them 5 stars if it weren't for their limited and inconsistent hours, the occasional sign that says "Not serving enchilada style due to personal reasons," and parking.

But...

Anybody visiting Phoenix or living there who has not tried this place, is definitely missing out. It's a MUST check out regardless.
