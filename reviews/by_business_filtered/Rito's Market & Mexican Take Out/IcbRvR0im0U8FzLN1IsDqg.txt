If your willing to wait, this isn't bad! Took me an hour to get there, order, wait, wait some more and get back to work. 

The line was at the door when I managed to squeeze behind it. Waited a good 15 mins, which sucked because the waiting area was so small! Ordered the green burrito, enchilada style and chips and salsa.

Waited another 25 mins before my number was called.

Their chips and salsa, Egh. Nothing to comment about, wouldn't get again. The burrito was delicious, with the guacamole it brought it up a notch. The only thing, there was more tortilla than cubes of meat. Maybe get it with beans too? The option was there.

Customer service was mediocre, they just hammered out the orders in robotic fashion. With the line out the door the whole time I was there, I get it. I mean, do they get pee breaks?!

I'm already thinking about going back Saturday. Only at 10am instead of 1pm. Maybe it won't be so bad??
