Delicious.  Per most the recommendations I read here on Yelp I had the Green Chile Enchilada Style.  The burrito was large and a bit spicy, very good.  I can't recommend it enough.  There were a few minor negatives.  Service is a bit slow, no fountain soda and menu options are limited to burritos, chimis and a couple of tostadas, but as long as you know this going in you will be very happy.  Bottom line = Great food at reasonable prices.  

They were also serving Tacos when I was there 8/3/09.  I've noticed some reviews say they stopped serving them, but they must on occasion.  They are not back on the menu, but they had a cardboard sign at the counter stating that they were for sale that day.
Lastly, it has been stated in other reviews, but in case you missted it Rito's is Cash Only.
