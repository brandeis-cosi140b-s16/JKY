I am from the San Francisco Bay area, on business in Phoenix. Let me keep it simpler and straight to the point; Rito's makes the best wet burrito  that I have ever had, the tender seasoned beef, and rich smoky enchilada sauce is absolutley incomprable. You must be able to 'move,' in a real neighborhood so if you are the 'coorprate,' type, keep your sorry behind in the hotel! If you are, however, a real person who likes real mexcan, A Rito's burro is as good as it gets! 

PS-really friendly customer service, and sweethearts behingd the counter make for an even better experience!
