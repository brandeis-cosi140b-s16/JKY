I am so very sad that I don't work anywhere near Rito's, because I would frequent them for lunch if I did! Instead I am left with being able to go once in a while when I am either home for lunch or just happen to be in this part of town.

I was lucky enough to be in this part of town a few weeks back, which  was why I was able to try Rito's for the first time. 

I went along with the many suggestions on Yelp and ordered the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada Style. I also ordered a side of Refried Beans. They were both full of flavor and worth every penny. I don't mind the price so much if my Mexican food is worth it! 

The amount of food was enormous! I had enough for a snack the next day! I am looking forward to going back as soon as I possibly can!!

Thank you Yelp! Once again you succeeded in helping me find a really great place to eat!
