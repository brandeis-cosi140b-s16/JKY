I LOVE this place.  I have been coming here since I was a kid. Being mexican I am very picky about the Mexican food I eat outside old my home and compare everything to how my grandma makes it. That being said,  Rito's is by far the BEST place you can get authentic mexican food. I highly recommend the guacamole tacos.  You won't find them this good anywhere else. no matter what I get, I always get a side of rice and beans because they are amazing.  

Con: there are a lot of other people who feel the same way as I do so there is usually a long wait and not enough space to wait. However it is well worth the wait. Everything is made fresh to order. 

FYI - I am typing this as I am at Rito's waiting for my order. Looks like my orders up, gotta go!
