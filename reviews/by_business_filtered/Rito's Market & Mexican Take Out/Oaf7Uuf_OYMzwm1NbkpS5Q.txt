Green Chili Burrito Enchilada style.  They only make a few items, it's in da hood, and there is a line of people in suits out front every time I go. 

Just one drawback, and it's no surprise, they take cash only.  That just sucks cuz sometimes I want to stop even when I don't have cash in my pocket.  Also, I think the hours are somewhat limited to just lunch.  

Rito's is a WIN.
