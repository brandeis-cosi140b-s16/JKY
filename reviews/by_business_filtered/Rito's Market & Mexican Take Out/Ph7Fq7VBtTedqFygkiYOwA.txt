This place is a house across the street from an elementary school.  You will wait 10-15 minutes in line just to order, then another 10-15 minutes just to get your food.  There is no where to sit but outside (so summers get the food to go).   Also this place is the dive of all dives when it comes to Mexican food.  All that said, i dream about their food and curse them for not being open on the weekends!  

The green chile anything is good, I get just a bean and rice burrito and then add green enchilada sauce.   I would drink that green sauce by the buckets if i could. I even asked if i could order just the sauce for to-go and they told me no.  BOO!

Bottom line if you are adventurous and like mexican food this is your place.  One more tidbit I am pretty sure the green sauce is not vegetarian, but that has not stopped my veggie friend from still eating eating it.  She just picks out any chicken in the sauce she sees! ha ha  That is how much she likes it!
