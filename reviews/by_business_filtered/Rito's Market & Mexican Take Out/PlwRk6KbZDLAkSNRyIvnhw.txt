I seriously thought I was going to cry the day the sign went up: 
No more tacos. 
Sorry. 
This is not a punishment! 
~Rito's

But in reality it doesn't matter because everything else on Rito's menu is so wonderful you won't miss the tacos. My favorite - red burro, enchilada style. Amazing.

A couple of things to remember about Rito's:
-No inside seating, which makes it difficult in the summer.
-No credit cards accepted.
-They are always busy, so expect to wait.
-No use in calling in an order. Every time I have I have waited anyway.

The last time I was there, my lunch companion said "I love Carolina's, but this really is the best Mexican food in town." Even though I am a HUGE Carolina's fan, I have to agree.

P.S. Word on the street is they occasionally make tacos. If anyone wants to tip me off on taco day, I would greatly appreciate it!
