I just stop by here for the first time today! I ordered a green chili burro enchilada style! (red sauce)  it was really, really good! I usually go to Rosita's place for their green chili. (arguably the best in Phoenix) this is definitely right up there, and I will be going back to this place again soon!!! If you're looking for authentic green chili you will not be disappointed going to this place!!!
