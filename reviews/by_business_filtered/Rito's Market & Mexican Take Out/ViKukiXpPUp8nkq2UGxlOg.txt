Yeah the food is great, up there with the best Mexican stands in a town that competes for the best in that category anywhere. Rito's has a loyal following who are inured to the hardships of no parking, long waits, and cramped quarters. I think their red chile burro is excellent, but prefer Carolinas. My wife had a wonderful bean chimi, but again in comparisons with Azteca and others, there is no clear cut superiority to our thinking. So when we are near, we will check it out. If there are long lines we'll keep moving. It's not so special to endure the discomfort and slightly aggressive pricing.
