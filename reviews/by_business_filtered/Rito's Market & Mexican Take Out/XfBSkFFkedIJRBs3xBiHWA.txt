OMG , I got brought here for lunch since we were in the "hood" which it is lol. We pulled up and I didn't even notice it was a restaurant. It is a old house converted into a Mexican restaurant with no sign out front. 

We got there at 12:30 pm with 9 people already in line, while there for 5 min another 20+ people showed up! The old small house only hold at most 15 people so its a little crammed but knowing your gonna get delicious food you close your eyes and imagine eating :)

They do have only a basic menu and DO charge for everything from salsa to sour cream. Also no drink fountain. Its like buying Mexican food from mexico and a taco shop, only cans and bottles of soda/water.. 

After waiting 20 min to order and get my food we sat down at there outside eating areas and chowed in. DELICIOUS ( see picture) my red chili burro enchilada style was covered in hot melted cheese and red sauce. It was extremely fresh and flavors were on point. It was a 5/5 stars for me. 

I would recommend this place to anyone in the area , but be warned
1) Get there early to beat the rush
2) During summer you might wanna eat in your car or get to go ! Due to outside seating having no shades 
3) The best option out of them all ENJOY!!
