The first time I went to Rito's, my coworker and I happily drove off, chatting about how we couldn't wait to get back to the office to finally see what all the fuss is about.  Well we truly could NOT wait. We had to pull in at the parking lot of a church, not one block away from there because the aroma was just too much! Honest!

Rito's wouldn't be as fun without the Soup-Nazi attitude of the people running the joint.  I think it's hilarious. It's a Phoenix landmark and a MUST for out-of-towners.

And they CAN be that way to us. They can require cash only. Make you keep your mouth shut unless ordering EXACTLY what is on the VERY LIMITED menu and nothing more.  As far as ordering goes, I ought to add that the word "ordering" is misleading. We don't "order" our lunch at Rito's. We request.

These people are serious and so am I. I want my bean/cheese/enchilada style and I will do whatever it takes to get it. Don't come with me and get an attitude with them or I'll rip your head off. I will NOT be 86ed from Ritos on account of you! But you can cry on my shoulder as I wolf down my burrito. I understand.

Only thing I want to correct, which I think is unfair in some other reviews: the neighborhood isn't as bad as people like to say. Yeah there is gang activity, but come on. When was the last time some innocent person just getting their lunch was assaulted or shot in the Garfield neighborhood?  Can't remember? That's because the trouble makers usually make trouble for themselves and each other and don't usually bother the rest of us. 

Bottom line, if you can't handle central phoenix, stick with your local tacobell/pizzahut/kentuckyfriedchicken drive thru in anthem.
