I took a few staycation days this week and made a list of things I never have time to do.  Getting food @ Rito's was on the list.  I've lived in Garfield for 2 years, but I work outside of the neighborhood from 9-5, so I'm never around during Rito's business hours (according to a sign inside, M-F, 9-4).  I rode my bike over on a fine, sunny Friday around 12:30.  I approached from the south, so I could see the patio seating.  If you approach from Roosevelt St., it's easy to miss this place!  There's no signage of any kind, but lots of people parking and waiting outside.

The atmosphere is absolute hole in the wall.  You order through a window with bars at the counter, which is a practical arrangement for the location.  Garfield is pretty chill these days, but that has not always been the case.  There are chairs along the wall for your waiting pleasure, but not nearly enough and they get snagged quickly.  There's a limited menu, but the day I visited, there were 4 specials written on a chalk board.

I am an enchilada girl, so I was pretty happy when I saw them on the specials board.  I know burritos are what Rito's is known for, but I figured I could come back any day and try a burrito.  I ordered 2 cheese enchiladas and a side of beans.  I waited about 15 minutes for my food.  I put it in my bike basket and pedaled home in anticipation of a great Mexican lunch.

The enchiladas were generous, but the sauce was not nearly as tasty as the sauce at Carolina's.  And the enchiladas were pretty greasy.  The beans were soupy and delicious.  I will not order the enchiladas again, but I will go back and give the burritos a try.  The sodas are in cans, so I passed on a beverage.

I'm glad I didn't wait until next week to make my Rito's excursion, because a sign inside announced that they'll be closed all week for "spring break."
