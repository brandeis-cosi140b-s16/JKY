When I meet people from out of town and they ask me 
"Where do we go to get really good, authentic Mexican food?" 
my answer will always and forever be RITOS!

DEEEEE-LICIOUS chimichangas and the best green chile this side of any freaking river. Occasionally they will have a daily special, but most days it's just the 6 to 8 things they have to chose from on their little menu board. They don't advertise it, but they will make cheese crisps for your little ones. My daughter still hasn't gotten into eating beans or spicy chicken or beef, and a couple of times they made her a quesadilla.

Don't be put off by the super huge line of people coming out the door, you will want to wait for this food. Make sure you have the time to find parking and wait. The reward is worth it.
It's cash only and they close a little after lunch time. They have canned sodas for you to sip on and a small patio around the corner for you to sit and enjoy your food.
Seriously. SO GOOD!
