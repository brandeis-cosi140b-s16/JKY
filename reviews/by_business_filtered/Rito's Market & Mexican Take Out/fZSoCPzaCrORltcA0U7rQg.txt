Eating this Green Chili burro, green chili enchilada style is like  winning the lottery 3 times in a row.

This has to be one of the greatest food stuff I had ever eaten in my life. Perfect blend of spice and all the other goodness.

Even when I burped it up, I wished for chunks to come up so I could re-eat it again.

If I could give it 12 stars I would! I need to quit my job and just live in their patio area and eat these until I die.

Cash only, open Monday - Friday, 9am - 4pm.
