Ritos has great food but beware about eating on their patio. I have been waiting for cooler temps. To enjoy the food w/out driving back to the office. We got our food and went to the patio as soon we opened our food we started getting attacked by flies. Yes you expect a fly or two when eating outside but there were a least half a dozen buzzing our food and table.    The problem they don't have covers on there trash cans. Above the cans were swarms of flys. Disgusting.
