I haven't been to Ritos in ages but I had to try my favs..red mix enchilada style with a side of rice and beans! The beans are the best in town! So flavorful! Red chili is spicy but not overwhelming. The rice is tasty all by itself but mix it with their hot sauce and you'll have a party in your mouth! I ordered two beef tacos..two words, de lish! Hot pulled beef with lettuce and cheese and put the hot sauce on and you're in Mex food heaven! Bring your cash and your friends! This place will not disappoint you!
