Ok so one warning they do not accept anything accept cash. both the red and green burritos are amazing the tenderness of the meat shows they take time making it. The menu is small and straight forward seating is all outside. Place can be hard to find for the first timer so watch for a red brick building with metal security doors at 15th St. Garfield. Now I'm craving it...haha oh one more thing its only open for lunch.
