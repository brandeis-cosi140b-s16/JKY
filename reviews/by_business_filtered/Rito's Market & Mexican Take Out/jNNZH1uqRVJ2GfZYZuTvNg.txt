Get in my belly!

So I have been going to this place since I was little. There's nothing like this green chili. Only second best to my moms of course. I live in Arizona and I only have a hand full of Mexican food places I will go . This is one of them. 
We took my itty bitty mother in law who eats very conservatively . She downed that bean burrito before we could even open our containers! My husband an I get the green chili chimichanga. Tastes like Christmas in my mouth. We only go on special occasions but the drive is worth it each time.  

Now the hours are limited and it is a hole in the wall (well the hood).
You will wait a while. Especially if you go around lunch time. However we think its worth it all.
