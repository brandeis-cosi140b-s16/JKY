This place is fantastic, and is one of the reasons I love Yelp.  I would have never found this place otherwise, even if you spotted me the square mile that it's located in.  It's the ultimate hole-in-the-wall, and the best Mexican food I've ever eaten.

I have some thrilling news to share.  THERE IS ANOTHER RITO'S (opened by the son of the owner).  It's every bit as good and may be more convenient for you.  It's at 51st Ave. and Orangewood - Rito's Burritos in the little strip mall.  Naturally I tested the green chile burro enchilada style and it was exactly the same, right down to the oversized pie plate.  Ahhh...

Don't worry, for those that are concerned Rito's is going corporate, the new place still has those stylish iron bars between you and the kitchen, and although it has bathrooms, they are perpetually "under repair," according to the glossy, pre-printed sign they've mounted on the wall.  And of course it's still cash-only.  So they have preserved that special charm. 

I know this will make the line longer at the new place, but it would be unfair not to share the good news, especially when I learned about the original from here.  Enjoy!
