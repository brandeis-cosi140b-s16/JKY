I'm pretty sure that my mom fed me Rito's bean burritos in the womb. My family has picked up takeout burritos from here since as far as I can remember. You know, back when (my hood) Coronado and Garfield neighborhoods were considered the ghetto instead of historic! :) That said, the building is small and traditional Mexican style with brick arches donning the ranch-style architecture and nothing more than a couple of plastic chairs to sit on while you wait for your order. I remember the days when this was the best kept secret in town, but I am glad they're gaining some more momentum and praise! 

Quite simply, this is my favorite burrito of all time. Their beans are so delicious due to their salty, runny, lardy goodness, and I beg that they never ever change!  The tortillas that they wrap them in are heavy duty and freshly made and ever plentiful! There is nothing more original than these and nothing quite like them in the rest of the Valley! Hallelujah, Rito's burritos, you are fond memories in my past, part of the joy in my present, and I always look forward to you in my future!
