Heaven in the 'Hood!

October 15th, 2010 - The last time I had the pleasure of stuffing my face with a green chili burrito from this little restaurant-equivalency of an orgasm. The following day I was off to California, where I would live, away from home for the first time in my entire life. 700+ miles away from my friends, FINE! Hundreds of miles away from my Mom and Dad, NO PROBLEM! Light years away from my little brother and my only niece, COOL! But no Rito's Green Chili burrito within 715 miles, HELL NO! This is where I draw the line. I am currently constructing a full-proof plan to move my little family and I from San Jose, back to Phoenix! Because this is bullshit!
