Oh Rito's, how you haunt me.  I know you're not good for me.  You're really not working with my intentions of "getting into shape" and "eating better."  

Oh well, you are so delicious.  

Rito's is a cute little hole in the wall in the middle of a residential neighborhood.  In my younger, less adventurous years I wouldn't have stopped here.  I would have missed out.

They only have a few options - red chile vs green chile, burrito vs chimi, rice and beans or no.  That pretty much covers it.  But what they lack in variety, they make up for in quality.  It's gooey, cheesy and delicious.  My personal favorite which I get nearly every time is the green chile chimi enchilada style.  If you don't know, enchilada style means smothered in sauce and cheese.  Sure it's messy, but it doesn't get any tastier.

Don't believe there is indoor seating, so you are left either taking it to-go or sitting on their outdoor patio.  That's all well and good when it is 70 degrees out.  But 100+ with humidity?  I'll take mine to go for now.  

Definitely worth a try if you enjoy mexican food.  My only other complaint is that they close early (4pm, I believe) so dinner is not an option.
