This place is delicious! Enjoyed it for the first time one week ago and I had to go back for seconds today. They accept cards now which is great, as I've heard they only took cash in the past. Parking is tricky and it is wicked busy during lunch time.... But well worth the wait! I enjoyed their bean/cheese burrito with red sauce and a shredded beef taco. So Legit!
