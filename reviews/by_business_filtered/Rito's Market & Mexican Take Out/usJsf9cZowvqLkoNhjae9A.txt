I have lived by this location for the past year and just recently tried it out for the first time. I have to say, I really liked it! The food was fresh and very affordable. Probably one of the better values I've come across in quite a while. My one word of advice is to make sure to give yourself time for getting your food. The place gets busy and can take a while to place your order and get your food.
