This is the best place in town to go for a green chili burro. The service is always top notch and the owner always says hello by saying my name. It's a nice touch. The rice and beans are also excellent. Not a big menu, but that's OK because I'd rather a restaurant did a few things well,than a bunch of stuff mediocre. Try the green burro, you will not be disappointed!!
