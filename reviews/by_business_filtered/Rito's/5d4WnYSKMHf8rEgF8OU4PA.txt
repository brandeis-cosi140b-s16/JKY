The food here is fantastic!   I've been to the Orangewood location several times and loved it,  so this had a high standard set.  This place did not disappoint!   Once I had the green chile burro which was delicious.   The second time I had the guacamole taco and the bean and cheese tostado.  Amazing!  The service is excellent.   I highly recommend Rito's.
