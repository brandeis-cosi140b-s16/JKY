What a find and what nice people.  I've passed by the Surprise location many times but after becoming disenchanted with another Mexican Food restaurant we've been doing without.  Finally today after reading other reviewers comments I decided to give them a try.  Richie treated me like I mattered to him and the lady who cashed me out was a delight.  The food was excellent and economical too.  We both had the Green Chili Beef Enchiladas with beans and it was a belly filler of great taste.  I live nearby and will be a regular from now on.
