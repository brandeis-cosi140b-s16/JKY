I read from another review that they had mechaca burrito here but they obviously made a mistake because they've never ever had that burrito there they probably thought it was some berto's restaurant.
     Ok so recently I discovered more that there's a chimi style green chili burrito and it's incredible it's still got that same green chili heat but with an incredible crispy tortilla on the outside a major plus to this little gem!!!
