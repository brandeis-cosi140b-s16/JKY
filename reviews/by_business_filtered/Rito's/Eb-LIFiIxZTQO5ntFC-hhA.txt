Best "green chile" I've found in az. This place is pretty dang good. I'm glad I remembered to come back since I found literally the best green chile chicken burrito since I moved here from Santa Fe. 

I practically gave up finding green chile but I was in the motorcycle shop next door and they re come des the place. I'm glad they did. 

The owners are super attentive. They want to make sure you enjoy the food. It's as if they actually care or something. I know, huh. Weird. ;)
