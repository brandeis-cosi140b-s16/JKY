Ever since I moved to Arizona years ago, I have been desperate to find great Mexican food in the West Valley. When I tried Rito's, my search was over. This is where you get great Mexican food in the West Valley. I've gone multiple times and never been disappointed. Everything you eat here tastes fresh and fantastic. Burros, Enchiladas, Tacos...they are all great. As far as the portion size, the enchilada style burritos are huge. Ive never left the place hungry.The beans are probably the best refried beans I have ever tasted, the rice is cooked perfectly and the enchilada sauce is better than any place in AZ. The food is cooked fresh, so sometimes there is some waiting for your food, but if you don't want to wait you can always call your order in first or drive thru taco bell. 

I know they don't have the best hours, but they could be open for an hour a day at 3 AM and I would find a way to get there.

In short, eat here. Nothing in Surprise comes close.
