Got to be kidding me.  Whose writing these reviews and how much are they getting paid?  Prices far too high for Mexican fast food.  (I don't care what their sign says; it's given to you on an aluminum plate and it's scooped out from what's prepared out in back.  Let's look at prices; $3.25 for a taco AND if you want tomatoes on it, that's extra???   How about forking out $12 bucks for a chimichanga on cheap pie pan?  Nope.
