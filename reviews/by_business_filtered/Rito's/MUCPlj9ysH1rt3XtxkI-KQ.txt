We just had lunch at Rito's. We were looking for Mexican since we just got into town, found them on google. Although I was looking for a nice sit down restaurant I am so glad we stayed. (Very small walk in and order) we had the green chili burrito and green chili chimi. Best tasting thing I have eaten in a long time!! Very friendly. Even gave us extra sauce free being it was our first visit!! Go if you want to taste  deliciousness!!
