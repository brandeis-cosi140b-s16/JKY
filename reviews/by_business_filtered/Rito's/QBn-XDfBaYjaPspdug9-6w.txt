Yay! Today was my birthday and I drove 100 miles to see Helen and Richie for the best Authentic Mexican food ever!  This is the best food love ever!  I had the green chili burrito, enchilada style, with rice and beans and it was fantastic!  Full of flavor and texture and most of all Love!  This is a true ma and pa place.  Ma does all the cooking and Pa tries to do the rest.  Go see them, you won't be disappointed.  Thanks Helen and Richie.
