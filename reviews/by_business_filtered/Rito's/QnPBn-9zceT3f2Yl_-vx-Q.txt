I have heard and read many good things about Rito's, so finally tried the Surprise location last Saturday.  Sorry but I just don't see what many others are raving about.  The place was half full but it took all customers about 30 minutes to be served.  That seems silly as all the filling is pre-prepared.  The green chili burrito filling was very good but minimal in size, mostly a large tortilla with very little filling.  It is expensive - Burrito with rice and beans and a soda was over $11.  The re-fried beans were excellent.  Some comment on the huge portions.  perhaps that is at the other locations.  I think Chipotle is much better, healthier and less expensive.
