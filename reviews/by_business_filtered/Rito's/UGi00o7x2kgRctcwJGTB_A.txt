The Best! We moved from California and were expecting to easily find great Mexican food, but all we found were the big chains.  Then we found Ritos!  We have been there twice in a week and will continue to frequent it.  I love, love, love the bean burrito, enchilada style.  My DH is very fond of the guacamole.   Maybe next time I will try something else, but I really love that creamy bean burrito with the yummy enchilada sauce!
