Ok, where to start.  Drinks over priced, they offer cans and bottles of soda. 20oz coke 2$.  They obviously are restaurant rookies not being able to recognize the ability to make money off of a fountain machine.

I ordered a green chili beef burrito with beans inside.
Horrible!  First of all the burrito was like a water balloon,  NO Lie! I took 2 bites of salty water put it down and almost the entire burrito emptied on to the plate.  The green chili was almost non existent.   The beef was void of any flavor and had a color close to white.  

Salsa was something like a cross of spaghetti sauce and ketchup.  

Do you want any salsa, hot sauce, spice with you food?  Me too...  :-(

Save your money and time unless of course you want to waste them.

Oh, beside my wife, NO Mexican folks were seen anywhere, but plenty of 50-60's aged white folk enjoying the place.
