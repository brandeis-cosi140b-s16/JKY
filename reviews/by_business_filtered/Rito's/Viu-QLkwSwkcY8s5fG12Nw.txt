Being a native Arizonan, I grew up eating honest to goodness fresh made mexican food.  This is the place for it.  Outstanding burros, enchiladas and tacos.  In my opinion none better in Surprise.  Richie, the owner is a real people person.  Knows my name and greets me by it when I walk in the door.  He treats my 7 year old son like royalty too .  It is spicier than other establishments, but if you're ok with that, then you should try this restaurant.  Mostly for take out, only a few cafeteria style tables, so don't plan an intimate sit down meal here. Their hours are limited, only open until 6PM M- F and 5PM Sat so plan accordingly.  Once you eat here you wont be back to the local chain a mile North of here.
