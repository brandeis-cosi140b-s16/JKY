We went into Rito's the other day for lunch. I've been to the location in Phoenix and I enjoyed it very much. The location in Surprise did not disappoint the green chili was excellent as were the refried beans. This place is definitely a step above the filibertos type of restaurant. Highly recommend.... The only thing I would say is there are no fountain drinks which is a little disappointing and the location is pretty small so you may not get a table it's mostly for takeout. And the prices are little bit high for semi fast mexican food. All things being said if you went to Rito's you would not be disappointed
