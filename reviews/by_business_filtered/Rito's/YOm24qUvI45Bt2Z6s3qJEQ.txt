Not really sure how this place is still standing?  The Green Chile burrito was decent, but I have had much better. No fountain soda machines...Are you serious?  First time I came here to try it out it was 6:30pm during the week and they were closed?  Really?  Note to owner-  If you want to make $ stay open for the dinner crowd.  Must be a front or something because every time I drive by the place has no cars parked in front of it.
