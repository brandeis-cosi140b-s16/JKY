Been hearing a lot about this place and wanted to try it out, 
Rito's is a little dive off of Reems, Supposedly they have another location elsewhere. So the girls and I came in for dinner, thank fully we had an early dinner. Rito's closes at 6:00pm! Kind of early to close? 
So we walked in, and ordered:
Green Chili Burrito
Red beef enchilada
Shreaded beef tacos
we also added a side of rice and beans. 
Their drinks only come in bottles or cans, when we ordered the drinks he was more worried about the girls spilling the drinks on the floor then taking my order. We haven't even sit down yet and the owner is already complaining. Since this is a very small place, seats are limited. When someone asked if she can move two table together so they can sit four people. He replied not to slide the table but to pick up the tables so they don't scratch the floor. Again, he wanted to confront the situation, All he had to do was to say no problem, I'll take care of it for you? 
With all of this said,
Their green chili burrito is amazing! I grew up with hatch green chili. When my grandmother passed away I have been looking for anything close to her chili verde. Sylvia's La Canasta on Indian School Rd have been very close to that taste, however Rito's just became my favorite place to get my green chili! It blows me away how some of the reviews on here are criticizing their chili verde! Sorry, but if you don't like the chili verde from Rito's, then you don't know how green chili is suppose to taste like! 
The girls loved their tacos, the red beef enchilada was good. I am not a huge fan of their sauce, I prefer Garcia's on 35th Ave enchilada sauce. 
The owner needs to lighten up a bit, Surprise is a grave yard for a lot of business, and I wouldn't want to see this place on its list. Rito's really needs to get a fountain machine. Being overcharged on cans and bottles will only last for so long. And you need to extend your hours! 
I absolutely recommend this place for their food!
