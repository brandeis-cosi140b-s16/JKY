Had to try this place when we noticed it up in Surprise last week. Sunday and Monday closed so we had to come back!! Growing up on Colorado green chili verde has made it very hard to find anything close (Santiago's!!) 
I ordered a green chili burrito 'smothered' but wanted beans and beef inside. Not really sure what I got but there was only beans and green chili inside. I did pay just over $10 so I got charged but didn't get what I ordered. Should have been $8.40 according to the menu. With that said, it was very good, lots of pork and a generous amount of chili on the outside. Cheese and lettuce made it great. Wish there was a hotter option but by far the best chili I have had anywhere all over Southern California and Arizona since I moved 8 years ago. Will definitely be back :)
