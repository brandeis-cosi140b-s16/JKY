I read all the great reviews on Yelp but was a little skeptical when pulling up. The store front is indescript and no frills interior but that's not why I was here. As a person currently living in Washington DC, good mexican food is hard to find. 

I was in the mood for a chimichanga and was suggested the green chili and beef. It did not disappoint. It was really good and living most of my life in California I've had good mexican food. This place is the bomb and I'll be coming back. People here are extremely friendly too as opposed to the northeast folks.
