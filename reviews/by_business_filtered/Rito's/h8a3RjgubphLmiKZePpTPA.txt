We live in the east side but we're in Surprise on business and went to Yelp for Mexican food. The first review said the green chili burro was great. Enough said. When we pulled up, we were a little skeptical. Mainly take out with limited seating.  But, we decided if there was seating available we would give it a try. There was and we did. We are glad we did.  The green chili burro was indeed delicious, just spicy enough. The refried beans were so so. Prices are a little high. I would come back for the burro.
