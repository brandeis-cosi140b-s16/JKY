I think the prices are too high for what you get.  Two people having two tacos, two green chili enchiladas and two bottled waters for $18.00?  No beans, no rice just a little (very little) lettuce no chips and salsa.  The flavor was very good but, come on, you can have a heck of a lunch for $18.00 most anywhere and they'll give you free water.  We would have had iced tea but it was bottled also.   I won't be going back.
