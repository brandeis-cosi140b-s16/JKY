Stopped in for lunch before going to the Royals game at Surprise Stadium. We read all the positive reviews on Yelp, so we figured it must be a winner. We had a really nice conversation with the owner regarding the various menu options. He told us Rito's is best known for its green chili burritos, so a couple members of our party ordered those. I had a taco and a green chili beef enchilada. Both were great. The green chili sauce was quite tasty on the enchilada. It's not really hot, but it does have a little kick to it. The taco was superb. The shell was authentic, not some silly Old El Paso shell someone got at Wal-Mart. The filling was even better. Perfect meat to cheese/lettuce ratio. The burritos are BIG and the folks in our party who ordered them were pleased. Also it's definitely worth it to get an order of chips and hot sauce. The sauce is sort of hot, but delicious. It's got a unique and addictive flavor. The chips are also very fresh and perfectly salted. We'll definitely dine here on our next spring training trip. Keep up the great work guys!
