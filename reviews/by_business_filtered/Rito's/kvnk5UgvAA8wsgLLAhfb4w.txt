I don't give five stars, but a 4.5 would be appropriate. I got the green chili beef chimichanga enchilada style covered in red sauce. The two sauces together were perfect, the beef was tender and juicy, the most interesting component was the green chili beef. This hatch chili sauce won't be found in a squeeze bottle in any restaurant. It was creamy, almost like a gravy, but it was a perfect balance of spice and flavor. Oh, and the owner took our orders and talked to us during our meal. Major plus! And as always, I ordered a Mexican Coca to top off the meal.
