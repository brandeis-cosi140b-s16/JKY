I am just coming down from my taco and refried beans high and can tell you how much I loved this place! A coworker took us here earlier in the week and I have been jonesing to go back all week with my kiddo. The beans. So delicious, creamy, rich, perfect. I haven't had refried beans this good since I moved here from CA. My kiddo said they were as good as Mario's (in Huntington Beach, CA - his all time favorite-) so this was high praise indeed! We also loved the salsa/hot sauce, again reminiscent of our CA fave, slightly different but close. The tacos were chock-full of shredded beef and fried then cheese and lettuce are piled in. Rich, flavorful, fresh and crunchy. Awesome homemade goodness! 

I love that this is a family business. Yes, the hours are limited, but it is really a take out place, not a full service restaurant. Closing shop by 6, and being closed on Sunday and Monday is something I can respect. It gives them a family life and a weekend. And happy people make happy food that makes their customers happy. We were helped by the owner who could not have been kinder. This will be a place that we will continue to patronize!
