Rito's. What can I say about Rito's? One word comes to mind...fantastic! They have a simple and streamlined menu, just beef and beans as the protein options. But what they do, they do it right! The beans are the best in the valley. Smooth, creamy and just a touch salty. Just how I like them. The burritos are huge! The people there are so nice, friendly and courteous. This hidden gen is worth checking out. If you like good, simple and we'll prepared Mexican food that is served with love, check out Rito's. Trust me. :)
