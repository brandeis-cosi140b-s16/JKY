Some of the best chimichangas to date! This is the 2nd location to open up on this family owned restaurant.  I think the other location, the original one, is downtown. 

There is only the beef option available on their chimis, which really surprised me that there wasn't chicken available too. However, once I took a bite of the gigantic chimichanga, I realized why they don't have more than one option. Why mess up "perfection?"

Definitely come here and try the chimis here. They are delicious. The flavorful red and green salsas are wonderful as well! I believe there are burritos here too, so I will try one of those next time. Or then again, maybe I'll just choose the chimi again, because I'd regret not getting one. If you meet the owner, it's great speaking with him, because you can really tell he and his wife love cooking and they really take pride in the results and it shows in the memorable combination of bold and spicy flavors.
