I loved this place! I'm a really picky eater normally, but this place has a wide and convenient selection. The owner was so nice and patient and the friendly staff put a huge smile on my face. Definitely recommend this place! Plus the guacamole and green chili is spectacular. -Grace, Carrie, and Chris
