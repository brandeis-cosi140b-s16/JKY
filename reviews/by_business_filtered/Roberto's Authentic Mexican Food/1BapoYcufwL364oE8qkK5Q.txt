Roberto's was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.

After seeing Roberto's on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, I was excited about the idea of finding some really good food at a gas station restaurant. Not because I like to eat at gas stations, because it seems like a really unique situation. With that being said, I was a little disappointed when I arrived at Roberto's to find it as a standard strip mall restaurant, and no longer being located in a gas station.

I decided to order a Beef Chimichanga combination plate. It was a pretty good chimichanga, but not the best I've had. The beef was tender and tasty, and the rice and beans on the side had a nice fresh taste to them. 

The service was fast enough and friendly and the prices were lower than expected. The biggest complaint is that it's located in Anthem which is close to an hour from where I live. I'd probably go again if it was located closer to the city.

Above average food along with great prices give Roberto's an above average rating of four stars.
