Ok, most stuff I have had is OK! But I adore the chicken chimichanga, red enchilada smotheted style. Their enchilada sauce has cinnamon or nutmeg or something special in it that just makes my taste buds sing! My hubs loves this dish too and he is a beef eater at heart. 

My girly likes the quesadilla, but to be honest,  Chipotle has the best chicken quesadillas.

Their salsa is tasty. The portions are large. It's worth a try, but go for the chicken chimi.
