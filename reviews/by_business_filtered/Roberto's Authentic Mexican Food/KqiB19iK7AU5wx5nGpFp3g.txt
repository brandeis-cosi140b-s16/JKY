We were in town visiting the outlet stores and decided to stop after seeing the yelp reviews. We ordered for six and were surprised when everyone noticed something a little off on the food.  All the refried beans had a very strong sour taste like vinegar. We told the girl working there and she confirmed that the beans had soured. At first she told us it was lime juice in the beans. She went and talked to the owner and they threw the beans out. By this time everyone was worried about getting sick. The girl tried refunding only the equivalent of what the beans would cost. I reminded her that there were also beans inside the burritos and in the nachos. The owner actually refunded our money and we left.  His explanation.. I've been doing this since 1991 and sometimes things happen.  It might be that the beans were bad when we got them. Maybe a "sorry about that" would have been better.  Too bad, because the part we did eat before the spoiled beans was pretty good.
