We were in Phoenix just yesterday and stopped by Roberto's for a third time. We've yet to be disappointed!  My husband loves the breakfast burritos, which he gets with one of the soft sided (el pastor) tacos.  Being no fool, I go straight for the el pastor chimi (solo, not the platter)!  It's a good thing we don't live any closer, we'd be weekly regulars and I don't think I could swim that many laps to make up for it!  On our first trip I had the chicken chimi, and could not believe how tender the meat was, absolutely delicious. Then I discovered the el pastor...au revoir chicken (as good as it was!).  I don't know what kind of marinate they use, but we love the flavor and tenderness it brings to the pork. Yes it's in a gas station, but we've always found it to be clean and the food is always fresh.  We arrived around 11:30 yesterday and got there just in time to beat a steady stream of regulars stopping in for lunch.
