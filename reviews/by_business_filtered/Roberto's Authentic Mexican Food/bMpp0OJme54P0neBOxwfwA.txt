While spending a quick weekend in Phoenix it seemed I was surrounded by chain restaurants and was having a difficult time finding the "local flavor."
Thank goodness someone recommended Roberto's. The "El Pastor" Taco
was one of the best tacos I've ever tasted. Savory spices and tender pork and totally not greasy. The staff were extremely friendly and there was something about that gas station location that was actually quite lovely!
