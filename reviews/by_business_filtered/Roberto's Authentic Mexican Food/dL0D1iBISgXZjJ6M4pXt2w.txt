Great good! We ended up getting three entrees each and loved them all. I wish I'd had room for the tamales. The 14 inch tortilla on the side is a nice touch. It was odd to be in a shopping center across from Subway, but a solid choice if you want great food and don't care about the atmosphere. The only down side was dirty tables on the patio (though they cleaned the others shortly after we sat down). It is well work a repeat visit.
