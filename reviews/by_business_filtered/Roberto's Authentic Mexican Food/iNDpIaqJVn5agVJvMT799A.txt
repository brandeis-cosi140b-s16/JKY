The glorious review of this place on the TV show "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives" was a little surprising to me.  I can't figure how they used those camera angles to make the place look so much bigger.

Yes, make no mistake it is located inside a Shell gas station.  You can buy their pop or walk 10 feet and buy the Shell bottles of pop.  This might be a novel feature of a "restaurant" but it certainly cheapens it a little, to say the least.

My cheese enchiladas had cold, unmelted cheese in the middle.  The bean burrito was fine.  Prices were reasonable, but this certainly isn't something worthy of putting on a national television show about great food.

There's also no place to sit if you're there any time close to the usual lunch or dinner hours.  There's no parking either, especially if people are using those few spots to go into the gas station for basic gas station items.
