Wanted to try the menudo after dipping into a craving recently. It's served hot in a large portion with chopped cilantro, limes, and tortillas. The menudo has a good amount of tripa and hominy, so I filled up pretty quickly. We've been happy with the food here on other evenings for dinner, so it's a good choice for casual Mexican.
