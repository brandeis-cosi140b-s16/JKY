Triple D led me to try this place out. We tried the carne asada platter which came with Mexican rice, pico, a little guac, and a tortilla. I went with my boss and we both thought it was was normal. The food was what you'd expect of a regular, run-of-the-mill Mexican restaurant, so we were let down. However, the horchata was fantastic. Possibly one of the best I've ever had. Don't go here without trying it.
