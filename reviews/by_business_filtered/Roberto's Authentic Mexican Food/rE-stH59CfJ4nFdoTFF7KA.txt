The glowing Yelp reviews brought me here and it was good but not (in my opinion) deserving of the rah-rah-rah. 

Note that this is an order-at-the-counter type of place as opposed to a restaurant-restaurant.  

My fish tacos were tasty although a bit bland.  The actual fish was delicious and well prepared but the tacos themselves could have used a little zing.  I did add the salsa that was given to us and that helped but it still felt like it missing something.
