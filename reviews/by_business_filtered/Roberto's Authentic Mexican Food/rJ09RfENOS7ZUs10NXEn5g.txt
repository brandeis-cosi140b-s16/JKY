We were hitting some DDD joints in Phoenix on our trip from LA, and hit this place on a Saturday afternoon.

It was, uh, OK, I guess.  I had the chimichanga chicken burrito, my wife had two chicken tacos, and the kids had other stuff.  There was some serious greasiness going on here - the food was good, but absolutely nothing to write home about.

By the way, the counter lady was a serious crab - no smiles, she seemed to be just putting in time.

Other than the kitsch factor of it being in a gas station, I can't fathom why DDD would have gone here....
