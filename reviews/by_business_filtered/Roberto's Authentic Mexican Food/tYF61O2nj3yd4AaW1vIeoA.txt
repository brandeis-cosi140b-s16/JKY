Best Mexican food in Anthem! Their breakfast burritos are perfection, if you're really hungry adding potatoes will be sure to fill you up! Speaking of potatoes,  I usually go with their California burrito that is loaded with flavor! I also really enjoy the tortas with soft bread, fresh avocado and your choice of fillings (I go with the ham). Their tacos are good, just not great in my opinion. Their freshly made salsa is a nice addition to any meal but is a bit too watered down for my liking. Service is always pretty quick. They offer delivery which I really appreciate while I'm at work. Much better food than Ocho Locos
