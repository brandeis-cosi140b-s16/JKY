My wife and I ate at Roberto's for the first time yesterday.  We are currently in the processing of moving from the Ozarks back to the Phoenix area after a ten year absence; one of the things we missed most while in Missouri, was Mexican food.  Since we are moving into the Anthem area we wanted to locate a decent place close by... We certainly found it at Roberto's.  Roberto's has a limited "eat-in" area and seems to cater mostly to take out and delivery but that certainly doesn't diminish the fact that this place makes great Mexican food.  I was very impressed... and we've eaten in countless places across the country claiming to serve Mexican food.

I had a chimichanga with rice and beans; my wife selected carnitas, flour tortillas and rice and beans.  We weren't disappointed.  We were also delighted to meet the owner, Roger, who was welcoming, personable and obviously well versed in the preparation of Mexican food.  The shredded beef in my chimichanga was wonderfully flavored, light and very good.  The beans were excellent and the salsa was very good.  My wife's carnitas were beautifully cooked being slightly crispy but still very moist and flavorful.  I'm looking forward to a long relationship with Roberto's; I plan to return frequently and try everything on the menu.

I would love to see Roger's business thrive and develop into a larger operation as a "sit-down" restaurant as did the original Garcia's (one of my all time favorite places).   I will certainly do my part by continuing to patronize Roger's fine establishment.  I am very picky when it comes to Mexican Food and his place is one of the best and most affordable that I have ever patronized.
