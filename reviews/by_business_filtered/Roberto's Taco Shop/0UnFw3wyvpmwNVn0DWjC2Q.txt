Great place to go to when you are craving food in the middle of the night. Best carne asada fries I've had in Vegas!

I chose this location simply because I like to be able to go inside and sit to wait for my food. Unlike the Charleston location inside the car wash place.

This location has been the best one I've ever been too. Extremely clean! And very friendly. My food was made just how I wanted it In a timely manor. This is my new favorite location for sure!
