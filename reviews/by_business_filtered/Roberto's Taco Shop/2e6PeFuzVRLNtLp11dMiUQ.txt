Whenever the craving for Mexican food hits, I go to this Robertos. The food is consistent and the place is pretty clean. I get one of three things: a California burrito, carne asada nachos, or a breakfast burrito. The nachos are massive so my husband and I usually share. Everything is seasoned well and really fulfills my need for a greasy delicious fix.
