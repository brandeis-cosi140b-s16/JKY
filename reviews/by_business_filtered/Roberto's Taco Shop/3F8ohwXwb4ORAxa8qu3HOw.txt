Ok you're drunk out of your mind and have the munchies. You don't really care about eating healthy considering the amount of carbs and calories you just consumed with that last shot of Jameson's or that 24 pack of pabst blue. Where should you go? Well considering that there is one designated driver in your group or at least still have the ability to stand and walk, you should definitely give this place a try. 

Roberto's Taco Shop is essentially what it is. A hole in the wall Taco shop with chains of stores spread across the valley to help hungry people get their Mexican fix. With its staff of Spanish speaking staff also fluent in understanding the ramblings and slurred speech of people who have had way to much to drink. They'll work to the best of their abilities to serve you good Mexican food. You want chorizo, they got chorizo? You want carne asada? They have carne asada? Whatever Mexican cuisine you want they mostly likely have. However I do recommend that you order the carne asada nachos or fries. Super delicious and will definitely make the perfect last meal since its fatty content has to almost guarantee you a heart attack. It's cheap and it'll get you full.
