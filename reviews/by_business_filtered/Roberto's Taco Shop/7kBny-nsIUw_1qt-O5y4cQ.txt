my roommate and i always come to this Roberto's because it appeared to be the nicest of all of them but unfortunately we both got a bad case of food poisoning after ordering the 3 rolled tacos. almost immediately did we begin to feel ill and it lasted 3 days after that. Just thought id share my experience! Be careful people!
