The only reason that I gave this place 2 stars was because of the carne asada burrito. My breakfast burrito with carne asada was so dry and I could make one way better at home myself. My chicken taco was so bland I think the meat was prepped for the nursing home with no seasoning or a pinch of salt. Heck my horchata was even mediocre. 

I saw reviews saying the burritos were huge and could full you up, not true. My husband and I ate a burrito and taco, and he still went to the fridge and made himself a sandwich afterwards. We will not be going back!
