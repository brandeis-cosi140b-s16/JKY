This is your typical 24hour cheap Mexican food place. 
The food is pretty delicious and the prices are not too bad.
What I especially liked about this location is how clean it was!! Another awesome thing about this location is the fantastic service! My group was greeted upon coming in and the cashier was super friendly! 

Thing I liked the best: Cucumber slices at the salsa bar!
