Wow!!! The food is fresh with every bite! You will get drunk of this food! First time coming in and the only taco stand close to us and they didn't disappoint us. The enchilada/ taco combo has a fresh taste with a little kick of the red salsa. I was amazed at how tasty it was! Definitely will be back.
