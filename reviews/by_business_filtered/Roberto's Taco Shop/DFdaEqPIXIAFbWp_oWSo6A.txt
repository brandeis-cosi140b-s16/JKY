Our drive thru order was missing items. Missing the sour cream we ordered and order of rice. We paid for the items but they weren't in the bag. Also, no utensils and minimal condiments. 

The carne asada taco meat was dry and the salsa on top had too much onion. I was picking it off. I can do some onions but not that much. The carnita taco had good flavor though but was lukewarm. 

Just make sure to check your bag whenever you order from this place to make sure they didn't forget anything. I probably won't return.
