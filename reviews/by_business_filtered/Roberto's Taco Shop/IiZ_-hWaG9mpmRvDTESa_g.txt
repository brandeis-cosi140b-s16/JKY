Their rolled tacos are bomb. We call them taquitos...the last few times I've eaten there I've gotten sick the runs in hour or less. The cashier and cook were rude and loud. I asked the cashier for my drink first, the cashier said sure then made me wait till my order was up?! I will not be coming here anymore.
