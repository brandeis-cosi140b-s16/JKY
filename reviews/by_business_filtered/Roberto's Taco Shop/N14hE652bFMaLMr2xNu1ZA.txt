The BEST thing about Roberto's is they are open late (this one is 24hrs!), and it is an easy place to grab some food after going to the clubs or bars.

The bad thing about Roberto's is the food is barely mediocre.
The quesadillas are soggy, the tacos & burritos are meh.

But the service is always great! Service with a smile, no matter which Roberto's I have gone to in Las Vegas.
