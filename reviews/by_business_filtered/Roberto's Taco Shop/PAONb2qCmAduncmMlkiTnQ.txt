The food is always great but I do have some concerns about cleanliness. While I was there an employee was standing on an apron on the front counter washing the wall.  He had half his grimy shoe on the apron and half on the counter surface where you pick up your food. For some reason, the staff always seem to act a little passive aggressive. For example, you walk up to the counter and the staff will have a two or three minute conversation among themselves before greeting you. Another weird thing is they guard the paper napkins like they're bars of gold at Fort Knox. No napkins at the tables or salsa bar.  Overall four star food, two star service.
