Not gonna Lie this is probably some of the best Drunk food ever to go for.  Open 24/7 with heaping amounts of food for cheap price.   You cant go wrong there.   With this one having a drive thru it's made qutie a few evenings that much more convenient.  The staff is usually pretty friendly with me in the drive thru and my food always seems to come pretty quick.  What else can really be said for a drive thru mexican dine in!  I get a beef burrito and cheese enchilada with a cheese quesadilla on the side.   Probably some of the most unheathiest stuff but shh if your coming here in the first place who's really caring at that point? ;)
