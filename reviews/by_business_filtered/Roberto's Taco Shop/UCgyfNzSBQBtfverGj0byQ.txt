What's not to love about Roberto's? It's cheap, fast, good and always open!

This is my Roberto's of choice. When the trifecta of hunger occurs (ie. hungry, lazy and cheap) I head to this particular Roberto's. I always know I'm going to get something delicious for a good deal. 

My favorites include their chicken quesadilla, carne asada fries, California burrito, rolled tacos or breakfast burritos, You can't really go wrong and there's usually a Roberto's on every other corner in town, so it's convenient and a safe bet. 

Now I'm craving a taco. ;-)
