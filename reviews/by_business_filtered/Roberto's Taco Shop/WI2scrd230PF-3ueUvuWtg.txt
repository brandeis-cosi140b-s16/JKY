My husband and I are staying in Vegas for the weekend and found a cool home with private master suit to stay in rather then a hotel, great choice! anyway...we wanted to find a local place that was well priced and good food, so of course I check out Yelp on my iPhone!  Found this place and decided to try it.

Wow is that a lot of food!  I got the bean tostada and cheese enchilada plate and my hubby got 2 fish tacos and a bean and cheese burrito thinking its small...well it wasn't lol, way too much food!  The beans were a bit salty, which is saying something because I love salt, but everything else had great flavor.  I have eaten at one other mexican food place out of a gas station and it was amazing too!  There is something to these little places, I have no idea what but it is awesome lol.
