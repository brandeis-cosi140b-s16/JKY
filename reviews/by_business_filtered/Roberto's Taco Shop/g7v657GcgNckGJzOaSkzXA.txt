Got the california burrito, it was pretty good! 

The hot sauces weren't spicy at all, I had to load up on the red and green sauce to get some form of spiciness.

As for the burrito itself, it was worth about two meals -  but then again I don't eat too much in one sitting to get full.

Opens 24 hours a day (Or so I think).
