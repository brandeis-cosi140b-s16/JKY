Mmmmmm finally got to try  Robert O's and it was delicious! Couldn't  decide what to order off the menu because everything looked amazing     . Excellent guacamole!  Service was quick and food was delicious .   I like that you can grab limes and other toppings to place on your food . Sounds weird but the mtn dew was excellent lol. Server was nice. We  will definitely   return to try many other things .   We got the chili rellenos and rolled chicken tacos and a massive cheese quesadilla. Refried beans were very tasty. Tons of cheese atop the rolled tacos   .  No complaints!
