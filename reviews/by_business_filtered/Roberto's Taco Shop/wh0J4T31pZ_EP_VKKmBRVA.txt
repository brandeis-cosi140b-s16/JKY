I often come to Vegas to visit my family and we were just looking for somewhere quick to eat. This place was pretty good! I'm from Southern California where the Mexican food is near authentic. I had the enchiladas and the chicken was lean. My dad had the fish tacos and he didn't have any complaints. It's pretty clean and so is the bathroom. Not to mention they have a complete salsa bar. I'd come here again if I was in the neighborhood looking for Mexican food.
