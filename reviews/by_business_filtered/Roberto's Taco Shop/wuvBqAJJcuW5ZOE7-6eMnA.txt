**Review only on the Horchatta***

Came here drunk one night during our spring break vacation. It was kind of hard to find since our GPS lead us to an apartment complex. We finally managed to find it after we got out of the apartment complex...it's literally in front of that and next to a gas station. 

We went to the Drive-Tru and I ordered the small Horchatta and my girlfriend got the 2 enchiladas. She did say they were good but they FORGOT to put forks and spoons into her bag so she had to eat it with her hands and use the sauce container cover to scoop up the sauce.

My horchata was cheap and delicious...very refreshing and cinnamony. It was a little to sweet for my liking so I couldn't finish it all but it was still pretty good.
