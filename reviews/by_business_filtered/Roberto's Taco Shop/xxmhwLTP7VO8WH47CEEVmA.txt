Highly recommend the staff friendly service for the midnight crew. They always know my order and grill the green onions from the condiment bar I bring to them. However if you are a vegetarian please make it clear that you don't want meat, couple of my friends order breakfast burritos with no meat and sometimes they still put the meat in there. No mess ups for my orders though!
