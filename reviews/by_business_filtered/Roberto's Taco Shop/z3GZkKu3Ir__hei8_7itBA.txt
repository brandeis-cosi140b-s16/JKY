I have no idea why people think this food is great. I went with beef tacos to see how they do the basics.. it was tasteless beef and the shell was soggy and tough to chew. I was surprised how tactless the entire meal was and how the special hot sauce had no flavor. Sad to say.. it was really sub par food.
