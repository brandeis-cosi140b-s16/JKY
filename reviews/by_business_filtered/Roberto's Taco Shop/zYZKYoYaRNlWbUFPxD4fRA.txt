I am extremely happy they have a place like this in Las Vegas. I was scared when I moved here I wasn't going to be able to satisfy my super nacho fix. Roberto's is the place to go for late night Mexican food. Plus, everything is decently priced. I will definitely be back.

I recommend anyone to give this taco shop a try. If you don't know what to order, try any of the following:

-Three Rolled Tacos
-Carne Asada Burrito
-Anything with Carnitas

Enjoy!
