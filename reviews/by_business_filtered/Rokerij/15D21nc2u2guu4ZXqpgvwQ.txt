My friend and great dinner companion visited Rokerij and was I in for an unexpected wonderful night of food.  I heard about this place but never really believed the food was this delicious.  We ordered  and shared best of two worlds: the porterhouse steak with mashed potatoes and roasted eggplant and the swordfish with the green chile sweet potato and broccolini.  With Sunday night's half off bottle of wine, this is a great Sunday dinner place.  Rokerij, you will forever be in my heart as one of the best dinner restaurants in central phoenix.
