Oh Yes! This place is GOOD! Only been once, real early on a Saturday morning but the place was already packed so make a reservation for sure.
The Garlic plate appetizer is just awesome. I tried the mexican sampler with the chili relleno being my favorite but it was all real good. Definitely going back (with reservations) and trying some of the American fare next time. A little on the pricey side but they feed you well ( having my left overs for dinner) & the food is near excellent.  My only complaint is the lighting,  weird rose colored flood lights makes it very hard to see & if you get seated in the wrong place its like being on a stage with one of those lights blasting down on you.  But a great place for a date!
