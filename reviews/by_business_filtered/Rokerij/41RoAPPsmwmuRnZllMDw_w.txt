I love this place. After going to Richardson's for years, I could not wait for the Rokerij to open. My favorite meal is the Rokerij Steak. A perfectly cooked tenderloin with dungeoness crab mixed with jalapeno hollandaise on top. The wine list is great too.

If you are not in the mood for a sit down, you can always hang out at the bar, have a cocktail and order an appetizer.
