Great business lunch place!
Atmosphere is as described in other reviews - cozy upscale - and the coziness is just right for a business lunch. The booths have plenty of space for laying out notes, etc., without being cramped.  The sound level is perfect - easy to hear your companions (unlike Richardson's), yet muted enough that people at the next table don't hear everything. Also, it's sophisticated enough to avoid the "date" atmosphere so dreaded in a business lunch locale.  Tasty choices for all palates, though vegetarian selections are pretty much limited to some salads.
I've tried to hit the happy hour a few times but the happy hour prices are limited to those seated at the hard-to-get bar seats.  If you are not there early, don't plan on the happy hour deals.
