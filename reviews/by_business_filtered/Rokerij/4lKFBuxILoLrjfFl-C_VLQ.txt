NOT MEXICAN - wish they would fix this.

I went for happy hour which is weeknights after 10pm and also earlier I believe. 

You can have their amazing appetizers for only $5. You have to sit at the bar but that's great. That's where they cook the food!

Everything was delicious: seafood, meat, vegetables.

It is almost impossible to get in for dinner on a Fri/Sat night. They get busy.
