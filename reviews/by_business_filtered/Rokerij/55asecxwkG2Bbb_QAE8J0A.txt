The food is great, the wine list too and the service is decent, but... what do you say to your waiter who tells you your food is delayed because they're busy with a large party upstairs, or when you ask if they have champagne they tell you their three options, bottle only - $72, $220 and $440. Really, I said. Ok, then.  Ok, when I can get a decent bottle of Veuve Cliquot at Safeway for crying out loud for under $50... ?? where am I? oh, right. North of Camelback.  And it's freezing in there, now that it's in the low 60s at night outside, does it really need to be ultra-air conditioned inside? But...I did enjoy the Ferrari Carano, Siena Meritage 06 very much and as usual the beef tenderloin with French brie on toasts was delish! And the veal meatballs rival Lisa g's meatballs not in size but certainly in taste and flavor. My husband had the pasta dish on special, flat ribbon pasta with a cream chipotle sauce, bacon wrapped shrimp...mmh, it was good, but not fantastic.  The service, when you do get it, IS good, I think they were short-handed though - our waiter was also the solo bartender... oh, and another plus Chimay on tap. 
p.s....how could I forget!?  THE best caesar salad EVER. I'd go back just for that.
