Can you say freaking awesome! I found this place on Yelp (where else) and I knew I was taking my boss here during our conference (she's from New England - and I'm from Cali). I knew she's never experienced amazing Latin food and flavors and boy did we have a great time! I had the Pozole, Ceviche, and Steak & Blue Cheese sliders! EVERYTHING we had was delicious. The atmosphere was very intimate with an upbeat feel! Next time I'm back in Phoenix...I will be visiting again!
