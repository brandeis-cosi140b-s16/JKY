We met a couple last night at happy hour who raved about this place so we had to try it.  Driving there, you think you are not going in the right direction.  From the street, it looks like a dive but when you get in there, it is pretty cool.  We sat downstairs at the bar.  It's pretty dark in there.  There were (3) menus to choose from; too many choices made it hard to decide.  We were there around 11:30 so we decided to split a couple of different items to try more things.
We ordered a combo plate of one eggs benedict with jalapeno sauce and the meat was this slice of heaven, I mean pork loin roast.  It was fabulous.  It also came with two blue corn tortilla chicken enchiladas in a green chile sauce - yummy.  We also had the philly cheese steak - the steak was ok - lacked a bit of flavor and the cheese was non existent but the fries were the skinny crispy ones and they were delicious.  The bartender seemed a bit dull and unhelpful.  We were asking her what her favorites on the menu were (we love when the wait staff rave about the food and talk about the ingredients in expressive detail) and she said, "everything".  We were left to our own to decide but we did pretty good.  

We checked out the upstairs and it looked pretty cool.  

This is New Mexico food, which is different than traditional mexican food.  Traditional mexican is one dimensional, new mexico mexican food has an array of spices and depth - much more flavorful.
