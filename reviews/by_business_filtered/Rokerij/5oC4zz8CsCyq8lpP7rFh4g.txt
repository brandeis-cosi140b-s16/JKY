Went here with a friend the other night. Decided to sit in the dining room because I haven't seen it before. Someone brought us waters but no one greeted us for at least 5 minutes, so we decided to move down to the bar downstairs. It was only a couple minutes before happy hour ended and the bartender threw in some food and drinks for us which we were delighted by. But the rest of the visit was less than pleasing. Both of the bartenders were detached and not warm, or welcoming. I honestly felt like we were a burden (although there were only three other people at the bar) it felt like we were getting the cold shoulder. The guy bartender did not smile once. Let alone make eye contact.
FOOD: the oysters were more disappointing. They were not shucked whatsoever and they were too large, and did not taste fresh. I let them know and they were taken from me but without apology or any action taken to remedy the situation besides taking half of the order off of the bill. 
Needless to say we decided not to order anything else, the uncomfortable visit went on long enough. 
I'm extremely disheartened by this and when before I would recommend this place to friends, I will not be returning and I will not subject others to this.
