I love this place and take all my out of town visitors here for a taste of the Southwest.  The only downside to it being a small place is that it can get very busy and can mean a long wait if you don't reserve a table.  I love that the bar seats are right in front of the open kitchen so you can watch the chefs do their thing with all of those enchiladas and carne dishes.  Their smoked turkey enchiladas are good but if you like spice, go for the rellenos.  Those are some hot roasted green chiles and I love the beef filling and the duck option.  Goes great with a glass of Stella on draught.  Very dark swanky chocolate brown interior with a fireplace and wine bottle walls.
