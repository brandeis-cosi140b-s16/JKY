We went here last night on our way home.  I love that they are open late as we didn't get there till after 10 pm.  If you go earlier, be prepared for a long line/wait.  The food here is always consistently good.  B/F loves the Chimayo Chicken with their fabulous Green Chili Potato.  Last night he had the roasted corn for the side which was amazing.  I got one of their specials - Swordfish with an fantastic pineapple cilantro salad and my sides were the GCP and zucchini.  Excellent meal all around.  My only complaint is, I wish they would get rid of the tv's or make it in a section that is away from the dining area.
