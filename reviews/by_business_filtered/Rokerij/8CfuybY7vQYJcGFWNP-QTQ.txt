I used to go to Richardson's religiously before the great fire of July/2009. Thanks to the tragic loss of my original introduction to the holy trinity, I slid into The Rokerij one evening in search of my "last supper appetizer" THE Garlic Plate. 

 Favorite dish in the valley, hands down. 

 The hole downstairs makeshifts for a great date night venue, in thanks to the lack of cellular service. You can keep your partner's attention solely on you for the duration of your meal/bottle of wine/conversation...

 I always fail to remember the after effects of said Garlic Plate. Your body will betray you, your stomach will take over and your boyfriend will be disgusted by you sleeping ever so close...
 I highly suggest at least a 12 hour separation from all loved ones if you plan on them wanting to hug you ever again...

 This meal is well worth the awkward night following, in fact I think I want some again tomorrow...
