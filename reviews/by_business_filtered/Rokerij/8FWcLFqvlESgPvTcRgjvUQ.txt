I wish there were 6 stars because although I'm sad Richardson's burned down, the menu lives on at Rokerij.  It is my favorite place to eat because the food is wonderful.  Normally I take in the whole dining experience...service, ambiance, etc.  but not here,  it's just the food. I've been to most of the best places in Phoenix but there's just something about the food that speaks to me here.  Go here and order the food of which I speak...then eat it and digest and smile.
