Knocking a star off for you Rokerij. Believe me, this hurts me more than it hurts you. I visited last Sunday and our service was friendly, but it didn't make up for the poor delivery of food and the problem with solving issues that we had. I have only had the small plates from Rokerij. This trip I decided to try some of their "New Mexican" offerings.  My appetizer order, which was specifically stated to be an appetizer, not an entree came with my entree. Considering the appetizer did not even have to be cooked (steak tartare), that's unacceptable. When I commented on it I got a "Ugh, I know, right?" Um...really? My entree which was the Rokerij sampler was meh. The best part of the dish was the benedict. The enchiladas were bland and plain old mush.  I had dinner with my best friend Amber, and my good friend Ayesha. Ayesha had me sample her enchiladas as she has specifically asked that she not be served pork. I bit into a bite of pork enchilada off of Ayesha's plate. When the waiter was flagged down, he said "Hm, not sure what to do about this." Really?? Luckily, before I went off like a powder keg, he offered to remake them. He didn't comp anything for the obvious mistakes that were made. I hope he realized that there were some boo-boos made when he saw his tip was so small. I hope to give back the star I just took away, but they're going to have to wow me to do that. It's too bad that this trip was so disappointing.
