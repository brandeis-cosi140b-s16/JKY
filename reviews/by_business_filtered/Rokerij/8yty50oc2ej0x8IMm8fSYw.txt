I found the Rokerij when I did a search of "most romantic restaurants in Phoenix. The Rokerij seemed to fit the bill. I phoned and left a message for an Anniversary reservation. The answering service promised an answer within 24 hours. 72 hours later, no response. I called back, and the very curt and impolite receptionist informed me that the restaurant doesn't take reservations for groups smaller than four! I thought this had to be an error, this is supposed to be a romantic establishment! I called back and talked to Mario, an equally curt and impolite Manager, who re - affirmed the "no reservations for groups smaller than four" policy. When I expressed my disbelief at such a policy, Mario promptly hung up on me. I called the Stockyards, and they were more than happy to take my reservation for a romantic anniversary dinner table for two. 
If you are a couple looking for a nice dinner experience,  the Rokerij isn't worth your trouble. According to their own manager, they would prefer that you go elsewhere.
