As loyal Richardsons fans, we went to the Rokerij for the first time when we found out it served a full Richardsons menu, YAY! 
First the good: the cellar bar is fabulous, love the ambience, the bartender and the fireplace. will definitely go back there.

the not so good: we had a reservation for table at 8pm, got sat down at 8:20-that is ok, and understandable considering the great food. our bartender offered us dinner in the cellar bar but we wanted to the whole rokerij experience so we waited for our table. we sat, and sat and sat, when our waitress did stop by, we told her how happy we were to be there and what huge fans of richardsons we are. We ordered, and waited and waited. Our waitress had another table that she was far more interested in than us and our service was subpar, a disppointment considering how excited we were to be there. The food was good but not the quality of Richardsons, something different. We paid our bill and quietly left, unacknowledged. 

We will return to the cellar bar for drinks and to Dicks hideaway for dinner and continue to anxiously await the reopening of our beloved Richardsons.
