Came him for my son's birthday (which we told our waiter when my son used the rest room)  My son lives in Phoenix and had heard great things about this restaurant and chose this place for his birthday dinner. What a mistake. Although the drinks and food were very good the service was awful. We had to wait quite a while for our drinks and appetizer to be served. I asked for bread and butter 3 times and although i saw other tables get it we did not till the bartender came over and said she was helping our waiter. At this point we still had not ordered out entrees. After a long wait we finally ordered our entrees and they came pretty quickly and were very good. After another long wait our table was finally cleared. A short time later a different waiter brought  over a slice of chocolate cake with a birthday candle. He stood their while we sang happy birthday then he walked away leaving us with no utensils to eat the cake. At this point we asked to speak to the manager. The manager came over and we told him about our experience and he did his best to take care of us. I will definitely not be going back due to this experience. Sometimes I will give a restaurant a second chance but not this time.
