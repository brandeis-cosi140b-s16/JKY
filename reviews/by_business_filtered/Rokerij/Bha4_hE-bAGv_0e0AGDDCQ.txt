I could go on and on about this place but seems like everyone has already done that so i will say the Rokerji is fabulous. Upstairs is very upscale with a gourmet fare that will knock your socks off, and downstairs is a bar that is super swanky cozy dreamy and well my favorite bar in Phoenix. I highly recommend the happy hour. Just go, you will love it. If you don't want to drop a few hundred on dinner go for happy hour and try all the super cheap apps to get a feel for the place.
