This was my first time to Rokerij. I was shocked at how packed it was, and after being there and having happy hour there, even more shocked at how packed it stayed throughout the entire evening! Thankfully we got there early enough to find a seat! With that said, it's totally understandable. Their happy hour menu was awesome and decently priced! The staff was super attentive, helpful and on top of their game.
