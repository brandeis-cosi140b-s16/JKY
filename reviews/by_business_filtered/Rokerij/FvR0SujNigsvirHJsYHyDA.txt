Sad. This used to be one of my favorite places. When we went to the new grand opening of Richardson's we were all so excited, but that soon faded with the horrible service, cramped eating areas, and food with no flavor other than hash or ancho chilies. I love chilies and I know that new mexican cuisine incorporates this ingredient a lot but that is all we tasted in all 4 of our different dishes. The cooks need to learn about portion control and tasting before serving. Very disappointed.
