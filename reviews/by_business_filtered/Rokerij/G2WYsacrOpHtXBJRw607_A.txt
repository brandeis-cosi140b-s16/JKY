One word for Rokerij- LOVE! 

I have only ever been to the bar because it is so wonderful that I see no reason to go beyond it. Great strong drinks for a reasonable price, amazing appetizers don't miss the roasted garlic plate and the charcuterie platter) and the ambience can't be beat. I can't think of a better way to spend a winter evening then being posted up in the club chairs around the fire there with a vodka and soda in hand and a garlic plate on the hearth. We need more places like the Rokerij in Phoenix!
