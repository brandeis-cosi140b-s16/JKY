I stopped by for happy hour on my birthday we went to the bar downstairs and it was really dark it kind of reminded me of a dungeon. Happy hour here is amazing! We ordered crab tostadas, onion rings, mushroom brie bruschetta, and steak tacos. Everything was delicious you definitely get your moneys worth here! The only thing I didn't like is that they didn't have a martini menu and the bartenders didn't know how to make any of the drinks I wanted except for bacardi and diet . I loved the atmosphere it was upscale yet down to earth and the food was amazing. Where else can you get bacon wrapped shrimp for $5?
