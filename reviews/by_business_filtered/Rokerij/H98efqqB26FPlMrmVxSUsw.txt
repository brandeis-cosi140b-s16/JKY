Love there sweet potatoe stuffed peppers and they also have a pasta dish with jumbo shrimps and scallops that is pretty amazing. Downsides, your not going to get a table unless you made a reservation so prepare to sit at the bar, you are required to valet park, spinach and artichoke dip as an app was watery and barely edible.
