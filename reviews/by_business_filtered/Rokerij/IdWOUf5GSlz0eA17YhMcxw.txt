Favorite happyhourundergroundeverything bar. Service is always prompt, friendly, amazing. I'm in love with the Chipotle Ribs, they have fresh squeezed juice and have an awesome bar selection. The fireplace is nice, so are the super comfy bar stools:)

Update: no more chipotle ribs:( But i'm really excited to try out their brunch menu!
