Wouldnt call this a a true Mexican but a southwestern restaurant but has many mexican dishs and some sides with chili.  The steaks are prime and aswsome.Other entrees feature great fish and shrimp and homemade made pasta.   Cesar salad is great, The garlic appetizer is awesome for two or three.  The wine list is good, not exceptional but you dont need to drink Screaming Eagle  at 1500 at  this restaurant its an over kill.  Margeritas and mixed are also wonderful.   Brunch with the $5 Mimosas arre always a deal.  

Bottom line this is a wonderful place with its sister restaurant next door, Richardsons.  Reservations are definately suggested.
