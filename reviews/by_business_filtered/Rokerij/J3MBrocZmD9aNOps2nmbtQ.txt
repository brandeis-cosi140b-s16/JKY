THIS PLACE IS IT!

The basement bar is like no other in Phoenix!  Gives a new meaning to hunkering down.  The food is delicious, the ambiance is just right.  Dark, comfortable and makes you want to stay.  They offer "Small plates" so you can try a different assortment of foods.  OR have a "bigger plate" for a full meal.  I had the skewers on my last visit and I think I will order them again.  SUPERB!
