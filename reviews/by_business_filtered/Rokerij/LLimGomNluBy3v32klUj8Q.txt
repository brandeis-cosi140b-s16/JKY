This is a friendly bustling neighborhood-type place which I love.  The three stars only are for having fish on the menu that isn't up to the standards of their beef dishes and apps. Sea bass smothered in a sweet and sour sauce with chiles, not very fresh and overcooked --uggh.  However, I did croon over my neighbor's beef dish. The crab mini-tosadas are really good. And the vegetable side dishes-all of them, including brocolini, brussel sprouts, potato in a pot, and asparagus--are commendable.  Great atmosphere!! Have fun.
