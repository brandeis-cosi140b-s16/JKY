I've been here over a dozen times. There are good things and not-so-good things about this place.

The good: the atmosphere downstairs. This is exactly what a great cozy martini/wine bar should feel like - the dented copper bar, the iPod music, the big TV with sports that is somewhat incongruous but at the same time fits so well. The fireplace.

The service rocks, most of the time. I think I've had a few sullen servers at times - and some that aren't so knowledgeable about the menu - but for the most part, the bartenders rock.

The apps are why you should come here, especially during happy hour. Almost every one of them is phenomenal. The crab on the tostadas is my favorite, followed by the tenderloin toasts. The scallops are great, also.

The bad: The actual meals. I shouldn't say *bad*, but I've always been less than impressed by my meals here. I had a fish with mango salsa dish once that was borderline terrible. The Osso Buco is meh, and the steaks are good but not great.

The prices. Bring your best plastic cuz yer gonna drop at least a bill for two people - probably more like two bills. Martinis and glasses of wine run 12-14, and meals are 25-30ish. All the prices really seem amped up a notch compared to the actual quality of the food/drink you're getting; I suppose you pay for the atmosphere.

Conclusion - come here for happy hour drinks and appetizers. Skip coming here for a meal, and head down the street to the Barrio. If you're gonna spend a fortune, might as well enjoy it.
