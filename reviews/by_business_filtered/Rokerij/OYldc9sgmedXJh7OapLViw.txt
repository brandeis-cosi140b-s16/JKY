Haven't eaten at the Rokerij in about a year - a pleasant experience then, but a disappointing visit this time.  Maybe I hit it on a bad night?  The appetizer was meager given the price, the entrees were ok, but nothing exceptional.  No comments about how good the food was across the board.  The dessert actually was very good, but too little too late.  I would think twice before going back, especially considering all of the great choices in the Phoenix/Scottsdale metro area.
