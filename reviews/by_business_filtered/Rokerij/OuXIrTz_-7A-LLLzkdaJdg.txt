This place was ok.  It was really in the  middle for me.  The space is pretty cool if you like dark, cave like spaces.  I ate downstairs which was a really cool space for a bar and would be a great place to gather friends for happy hour.  The food was mediocre in my opinion.  I had a dish that was "smoked" and  the smoke flavor really overpowered the dish.  It was almost to the point where I couldn't figure out if it was meant to taste that way or if maybe it was burnt.

In any rate, I probably would list this on my places in the valley to return to.
