Let me preface this by saying this used to be my favorite restaurant in PHX... This experience has changed that...  I made a reservation for 11 5 days before the dinner at 730 pm on a Sat..  after arriving promptly at 730 we were forced to wait 20 minutesonly to be sat at 2 separate booths...  Completetly defeating the purpose of a group dining experience..  Now the bad part...  For dinner I ordered off the special menu a wild boar bacon wrapped bone in beef tenderloin cooked rare..  I received a baconless well done hunk of meat...  I pointed this out to the waitress she took the meal hoping to have it prepared correctly..  a few minutes later the manager approached the table and informed me they were out of the bacon ( one would think they would know that before the meal was prepared and attempted to slide this past the diner). I was offered a replacement meal , but declined and decided to go with the soup.... This prompted the manager to inform me it was a spicy dish to which I accepted and said it was fine, he proceeded to inform me of the heat of the dish 2 more times both times I assured him this was fine leading him to question my order again at which time I was in disbelief and asked if there is some reason he doesn't want me to  have the dish..   this was enough to finally agree to let me place the order the soup came and was excellent and spicy.   I managed to persevere through the heat and eat the whole bowl ( I enjoy spicy food).  This ruined the whole experience for me ..  luckily everyone else's meals were enjoyable its just disappointing being treated like that at a place I thought so highly of and do everythingin my power to get people I care about to do it....  A sad day
