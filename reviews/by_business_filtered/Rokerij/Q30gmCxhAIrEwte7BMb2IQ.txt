So I am going to piggyback off of my sister's review (Courtney B.). This place was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!!!!! I am sooooooooo very sad that we discovered it two weeks before I moved out of the state. We had a wonderful experience with the wait staff and I liked the ambiance very much. But the FOOD, oh man, the food! I was blown away by this place. I would not have expected to find some of the best Mexican food in this somewhat uppity joint. But it truly was some of the most amazing flavors I have experienced. The green chili meatloaf with eggs was great but there was this unique flavor to the chili relleno that I am not sure anyone could replicate. And the Carne Adobada was seriously tasty; it was cooked perfectly and was just as amazing the next day as leftovers. This place is a gem!
