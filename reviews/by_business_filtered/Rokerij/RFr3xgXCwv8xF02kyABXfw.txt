Went there on a Friday night, had reservations for 745 but it wasn't too crowded. The food overall was good, especially the carne adovada. The hamburger was mediocre, the shrimp appetizer was bomb. The thing that really let me down was the service, not that they were rude just super slow and the waiters knowledge of the menu was weak sauce. He did comp us desserts for our patience. Cool ambiance especially the bar in the basement.
