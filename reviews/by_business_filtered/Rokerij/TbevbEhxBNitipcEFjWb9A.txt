I absolutely love this place!  It had been years since I had been back and when we had a friend in town from DC we decided to take him here...great beer & wine list, amazing food, some of the best atmosphere in town and great service.  I started with a wedge salad and then enjoyed the chimayo chicken for my entree...the perfect meal!  After dinner we went downstairs to the bar and continued our fun evening.  This place is perfect to escape a hot summer day or to warm up on a cold winter night.  If you haven't been, you are surely missing out!
