My Sis and I had a brunch day and we were going to check out Dick's Hideaway, but we decided that seating might be better here at Rokerij.  We were seated right away, at 11 on Sunday so I was happy it wasn't too crowded.  I love the look of this place, the dark room with a fireplace is awesome.  I loved the coffee to start.  My Sis had the meatloaf with eggs, I had the rellenos with eggs (one beef one cheese) and we ordered Carne Adovado to take home to her Hubby.  We REALLY ENJOYED our meals.  My beef relleno was so amazing and the cheese was just as good.  I loved the smokey flavor, especially the carne adovado.  Our waiter was amazing, great recommendations and clearly happy to be there.
