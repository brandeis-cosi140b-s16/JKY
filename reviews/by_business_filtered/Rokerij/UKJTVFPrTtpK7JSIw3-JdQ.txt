Have always liked the food here but that's not everything. We were told it would be a 30 minute wait for 5 but we could go next door. However no one explained that meant an entirely different menu. We eventually were moved back to this location.  Very unaccommodating with young children. No high chairs, no straws, and $3 for a glass of milk. Wait staff was not very personable and seemed not to want to be bothered. Just not worth spending the money to be treated like an inconvenience. The host/manager was very nice and helpful though and the food is still good.
