I lived in Scottsdale for a couple years but have been going to Richardson's for the last 10years after my Fiance introduced me to the place. Since then Richardson's was burned down and Roker now serves the menu items that I loved at Richardson's! 

You visit, you need to get the regular salad to start which is so simple but so amazing. Next you need to get the Garlic platter which is an appetizer that I absolutely love (the cheeses, the peppers, the sauce, the roasted garlic and the toasted baguettes- AMAZING!) Whenever we are in town (we now live in California), I make it a point to go back and eat this platter at least once during the trip. 

This place is Southern Mex food and there is not a restaurant that can compare. In fact the closest I have gotten to eating something as tasty is when we create our own replication of the platter which is good but not the original! 

In addition, try the quesadillas, chicken dish, bacon wrapped scallops..... all so yummy!
