Happy Hour now starts an hour earlier from 3-6 pm. 

Don't try the stuffed mushrooms, they were really salty. They have a pretty good creme brulee too. 

Still love the food and the atmosphere of the downstairs bar. 

When we walked out I noticed that they have a dinner special for 2 written on the chalk board just before you walk into the restaurant. You each get to choose a cut of beef (I think there were about 4-5 to chose from), a salad, and a side (about 4-5 to choose from also) for $36. Sounds like a great deal. We'll have to come back and try it out.
