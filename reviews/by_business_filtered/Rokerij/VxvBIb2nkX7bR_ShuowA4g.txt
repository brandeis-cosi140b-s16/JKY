I loved this place. My husband and I met another couple for dinner at Rokerij on Saturday night. From 4-6 pm, the small plates are $5 each. It is such a great deal. The catch: you have to be sitting at the bar. Not in the booths next to the bar, but at the bar. Each couple ordered 4 small plates and then we all shared. Pretty much everything I tasted, I liked. The brie toasts were by far my favorite...I could have ate the whole plate myself.  The bacon wrapped scallops were really good as well; the calamari was delicious especially because the breading wasn't very heavy and it was quite tasty as well (we consider ourselves calamari snobs). The crab tostadas were good but I don't enjoy cold crabmeat too much.  My husband tried the shrimp scampi and he liked it, but said that if hadn't come with the rice, it would have been bland. He said the rice added flavor to the dish.  With the small plates, it seems that most of the plates come with six of that particular item.   Drink prices were really good...for 8 small plates and 9-10 drinks between the four of us, our bill came to $84. I was shocked when the bill came because it was so cheap, considering all we ate and drank.

The decor in the downstairs bar area is really cool...it's very dim and dark, but it is really cozy. There was a real fire in the fireplace which gave it a log cabin type of feel.  I will definitely be back.
