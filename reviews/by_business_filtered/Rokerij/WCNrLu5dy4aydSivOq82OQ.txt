I really enjoyed myself here.  The atmosphere is really cool.  My girlfriend says the smell of the burning fireplace reminded her of Aspen... you could smell the wood burning when you pulled into the parking lot.  The service was excellent and the food was also very good.  We ate downstairs at the bar and chose a few things off the small plates section of the menu.  They also had a lot of fresh fish choices on the specials board.  I would definitely come back here again.
