Always the benefit of exploring new territory.   Super stoked  with this place and the ambiance. It  is romantic with the setting whether  you're  at the table or the bar.  The food stole the show for sure.  They don't take reservations less than 4  so it's a  battle if you show up a one on one sesh especially for the trad date type gig.  Anywho we got the scallops wrapped in bacon and only thing to say is that it was DELISH!!!  There were 4 types of dipping sauce acting as a base almost slathering the entire dish but they were overpowering.  We also split the lamb and I was teetering about the dish.  The sides were delish:  Roasted beets and some type of Jalapeno mashed taters thing which was RADTASTIC!  The Lamb was good but something was missing along the lines of seasoning.  Overall wonderful dish.  We finished up with a creme brulee which definitely hit the spot for the evening.  Had a great time and really loved checking out Richardsons as well!!!  Totally will be back!!!
