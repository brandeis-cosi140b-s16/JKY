Cool ambiance, eclectic menu and a swanky crowd.  The Rokerij is a neighborhood hangout with a unique and upscale twist.  It is located next door to Richardsons and shares some of the same menu items.  You walk downstairs the underground bar and you instantly feel like you've entered a different scene.  The place is small and consists mainly of a bar, a couple of booths and some cozy spots to curl up next to the fire.  It feels a little dark and small inside but I know that's what they were going for.  

The Rokerij is known for their happy hour but honestly, the menu prices don't seem like a great deal during happy hour.  Appetizers are only a couple dollars cheaper during happy hour.  We visited on a Friday night and the place was packed.  We were able to find a spot at the bar after a few minutes.  The service is good at the Rokerij - older, experiences bar tenders and servers who are knowledgeable about the menu and drink offerings.  Our waiter made some great suggestions on the menu which is always appreciated.  

The food is great, but slightly over priced for the area.  I would stick with the unique items on the menu that Richardsons is known for - meat and southwest items.   This is not a great place for vegetarians but there are several fish items on the menu
