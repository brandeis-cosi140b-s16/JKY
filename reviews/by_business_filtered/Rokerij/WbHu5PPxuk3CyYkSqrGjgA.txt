The Rokerij is kinda weird.  Its almost like two completely different entities, meaning their restaurant and their basement bar.

First, the restaurant.  I give it "four thumbs aight".  I've had better steaks, but never in a cozier environment.  Their booths are ridiculously private and can be really romantic.  Until you stare across the way and see some baby boomers molesting each other under the table.  You can bring your own bottle here, but their corking fee was $25 or $30 which made me really kinda laugh to myself, but not out loud because i didn't want to disturb the mood of the evening or the piranhas in table 4.  

So, my $10 tip-top Malbec brought back from the actual country of Argentina via me and a large airliner (vino is amazingly good and cheap there), was now $40.  Whetever.  I just expected myself to be in LOOOVE with the food which was not the case.

However.

Their basement bar is pretty much the most unique place to drink in the Valley.  Its focused around a wood burning fire and this is precisely where you go to get a strong cocktail or a deep red wine.  If you can snag the fire-front seating you will want to park it right there all night.

Man, when they used to allow smoking down here, it was like being in the Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes Lodge.  Too bad.  Another case of the gubments saving us from ourselves.
