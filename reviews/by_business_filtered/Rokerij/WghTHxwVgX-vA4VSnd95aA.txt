I've never considered The Rokerij a Mexican place!! The name means "Swedish smokehouse". Richardson's, next door and same owner, is a Mexican restaurant. BUT I love The Rokerij. Can't count of how many times I've been there!! Absolutely everything I've had is great. I do a lot of the small plates. They're calamari with its sweet chili dipping sauce is so good that it has spoiled me that I rarely eat calamari anywhere else. Whether upstairs or down the service is great and you won't be disappointed!!
