My wife and I stumbled into this place one afternoon looking for a quick bite.  We were just driving by and it was the first place we saw.  We were delighted with our experience there.

First of all, what a terrific atmosphere!  Big copper bar, candlelit, very dark and romantic.  Just lovely.

The hostess informed us they had a small plate happy hour special and that suited us just fine.  All appetizers were $5.  We ordered 4 items.   

The plates themselves were huge and we could barely finish what we ordered.  They were also each very delicious and the presentation was outstanding.  

Our tab for drinks, more food than we could handle and a big tip for our very nice server was $38.  Happy hour indeed!

We will definitely be going back for dinner.  It seems like the ideal location for a romantic evening.  The servers were attentive and friendly.
