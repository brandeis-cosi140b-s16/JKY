Was really wanting to love this place the ambiance is lovely and maybe I will give it another chance I ordered the steak with lobster medium rare it came back well done, it got sent back and the next one was med-rare but tasted like charcoal throughout I've had steaks at some of the best restaurants in the valley and have never had one taste this burnt, manager never came by to apologize, it took asking three times to get bread with my mothers pasta,  also I agree with another review about the artichoke dip was very grainy and chips were stale, but the cream brûlée was very good as well as my moms shrimp and scallop pasta, very disappointed on my dinner experience here... Maybe an off night
