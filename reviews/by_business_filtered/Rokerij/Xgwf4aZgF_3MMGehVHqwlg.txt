Steak skewer with 4 sauces app - 5 STARS!!
Pork chop and brussl sprouts - 3 stars... just wasn't as good as expected
mashed potatoes that came with my pork chop - 5 STARS!! sooo good! 
Spice burger and fries - 5 stars, really great burger! 
Flourless chocolate cake - 4 stars, pretty dang good, so sweet and rich.

My husband ordered the green chili burger and realized after the first few bites they brought the wrong burger, but he liked it (as was tooooo hungry to wait for them to correct the order) so the spice burger worked fine.  I got a taste and really liked it! I am excited to go back and try more of the menu!
