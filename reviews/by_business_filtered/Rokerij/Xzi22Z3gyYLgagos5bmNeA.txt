So the funny thing about good restaurants is that you almost don't want to tell anyone about them and make it so you have to wait to get in.  That is how I pretty much feel about Rokerij.  I made the mistake of telling my soon to be ex husband about it (prior D day) and now I have to worry about him showing up with HIS gf and I am there with.... someone.  Sooo.. that being said, I really like this restaurant.  Can I tell you tho that I ONLY go downstairs to eat.  Waaay cooler.  Stairs are a little tricky down... kinda thinkin that they are not up to code and an accident waiting to happen...maybe I could get a free meal?  Hmm.. ok, back to the restaurant.  The downstairs bar is a funky copper and there are 2 seats in front of the big fireplace (I never get the chance to sit there darn it) and all the seating in the restaurant (upstairs and down)is booth.  Love that.  Much more cozy.   Their wine selection is pretty good.  I pretty much have the Klinker Brick red all the time.  My fave dish there is their cornflake crusted halibut w/ salsa.  Deelish!  And their corn side is amazing.. roasted corn and the main man and I were stabbing each other over it.  He always has the mashed potatoes as a side and they come in this little kettle that is super hot. Just warnin you.  I am not much of a potato person but he says that they are good so I will have to take his word.  I even like their house salad.. has chunks of bleu cheese and if I remember right, cranberries.  Btw, Rokerij, you used to have spiced pecans in the salad too but they are gone.  I have a very sad face right now .  
Sooo.. that's what I think.. the Rokerij is  a great date place (but only plan on bringing someone you are really into otherwise later when you break up you may have an embarrassing encounter there) and perfect for the holidays!
