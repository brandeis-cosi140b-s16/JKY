I absolutely loved my first visit to this restaurant. So much, in fact, that we decided to take some family here over the holidays. Our service on this visit....sucked. And that's being nice. I asked our waitress if she was new, but she said she had been there over a month. After asking on 5 separate occasions for water, we finally flagged down another waiter and asked him. I do love the ambience...but will the "lodgey" feel be appropriate when it's 110 degrees outside? The food is good, but pricey.
