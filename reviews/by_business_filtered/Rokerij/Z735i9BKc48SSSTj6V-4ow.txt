I rarely leave any comments, but this one is deserved.  The hostess was cold and uninviting, the waitress was incredibly absent minded, and the entire staff we engaged with seemed like they were recovering from a hangover.

The food - this is the third time we've had brunch, and we've given it this many tries because we've had great dinners in the grotto downstairs, but it's like 2 different restaurants.  Our scrambled eggs were the best part of the meal.  We both had french toast that was covered with raw eggs that made the toast just fall apart.  Mine didn't come with butter or syrup, so we had to request it.  We both took 1-2 bites before giving up, and the pork loin was tuff with no flavor.  My second cup of coffee came with about half-full because they "ran out of coffee and had to go next door".  It came with about a full teaspoon of coffee grounds in the bottom of my cup, and I had no water to get the grit out of my teeth since non of us were given water at the table.  Our total bill for the two of us was about $40, and I've had much better meals at Denny's.
