It's an overall great experience. The food is top notch and prepared exactly as it should. And it's almost like visiting two restaurants, not because Richardson's is next door, but due to the fact that there's a cozy basement bar with a different feel than the restaurant on the main floor. I recommend getting drinks early at the bar then coming up out of there to eat. Makes for a good night. 
My only recommendation would be to expand the beer list. They have a limited selection of drafts and bottle. Albeit very good ones. But given atmosphere in the basement, which makes me harken back to days at some great Belgian beer bars, I bet they would attract an even bigger patron base by making it more of a craft beer haven. Maybe that's not a good plan for them though.
Overall one of the most underrated places in Phoenix for sure.
