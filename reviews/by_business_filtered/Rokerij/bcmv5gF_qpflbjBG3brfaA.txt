Last Sunday my family and I came in to have dinner for a celebration. There were 6 of us not including my infant son who was apparently unwelcome from the start. Upon arrival we checked in with the hostess and the first thing she said to us was "we don't have high chairs". Hi I'm great thanks for asking.... we decide to sit down anyway since we were meeting the rest of our group there. As we sit down our very rude hostess gives us 2 menus which would be great except there's four of us currently being seated and 2 that have yet to arrive. The waitress goes around the table taking drink orders and completely skips my husbands and walks away. We tried to call her and wave her down but she was gone before we knew it. At this point we decided that the evening was better off at another restaurant and we hadn't even gotten our drinks yet, yikes. As we begun to walk out, my husband holding my son leading the way, the snarky hostess irrelevantly informs him that they don't have changing tables. She obviously thought he was taking my son to the restroom but what we were really doing was going somewhere else who's service was up to par with a Denny's. I have dined here before and the food is good, not great but good, and I can assure you the snobbish attitude is not fitting for the quality of the meal. The entry level staff must find themselves to be pretty special.
