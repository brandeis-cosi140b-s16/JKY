This restaurant is so great! I love the food here, the steak with the crab enchiladas (might have been a special) was to die for. Also I don't really ever eat pork, but I make an exception only for the addavado (not sure if I spelled that right). Yum! We went with some friends and the bill came to a pretty high total but it was a very memorable night because the food and the surroundings were so great. :)
