I love the ambiance of this place. We dined on a comfortable, leather sofa in the cozy cellar downstairs. It was candle lit, intimate, and had good mood music playing. It would be a wonderful place to bring a date you would like to impress! We had a bottle of Shiraz wine, mushroom toasts, sliders, tortilla crusted halibut, and some creme brule. Everything was delicious & our server was very knowledgeable. We will DEFINITELY be back!
