Nothing but good things can be said about the food here, I simply haven't had a bad meal yet and doubt I ever will. I positively love New Mexican style cuisine and how spicy it can get. Pretty amazing how hard it is to find here in the Valley! 
Drop in for a weekend brunch meal and treat yourself to a super spicy Bloody Mary or a tasty mimosa and start the morning off right.
