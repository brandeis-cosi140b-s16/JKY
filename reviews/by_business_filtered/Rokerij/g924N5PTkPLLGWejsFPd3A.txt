It has come to my attention that I have not reviewed Rokerij. Clearly this is a travesty of justice so I'm here to make things right in the world. I've been to Rokerij twice now and both times left fat and happy. and buzzed. 

I dined at Rokerij on Sunday evening; it was a "Saves the Day" moment because the first choice restaurant fell through and Dottsy was starving and reaching for my throat. We booked it to Rokerij and sat at the sexy copper bar, ready to partake in some small plate action. As everyone has mentioned, the happy hour deals are for the bar only, between 4-6PM. They are running a new wine promotion too: Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, all bottles are 50% off. Yay! I ordered all the seafood plates: mushrooms stuffed with crab, ceviche, ahi tuna w/ wasabi, and crab tostadas. With the Long Boat Sauvignon Blanc in hand I was in heaven. 

I like that the bar is dark and cozy, though I noticed a light was actually out above me, making it near impossible to see my menu. The Happy Hour deal rocks, but it does make me sad not to be able to sit in those comfy leather chairs by the fire sipping wine and stuffing my face on ultra-cheap eats. 

Rokerij is a solid performer, and probably deserves that 5th star, but I'm holding off until I finally dine in the main restaurant and enjoy one of their delicious sounding entrees.
