This is a favorite GEM of ours in the middle of north central phoenis.  We ALWAYS take the stairs down to hide out in the basement with the BEST bartender in the world - STEVE (aka Jared) we love you. 

The scallops are my favorite, as are the brussel sprouts, the BEEF, and the desserts.  The vodka and soda gives you a shot of vodka in a glass with ice and you pour the soda...watch out! :-)

I DO recommend it, and don't worry about the crowds...just call ahead and reserve a table in the basement and you'll enjoy your relaxing evening.
