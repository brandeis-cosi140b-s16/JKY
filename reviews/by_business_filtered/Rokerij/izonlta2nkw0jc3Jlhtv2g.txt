We went to Rokerij for my sister's big graduation dinner.  We have been here before and loved the food, so it was an easy decision to go back for this special event! This time, we rented out the private dining room for our group of 14 people.  The room minimum is $500, which is prepaid, but applied to your bill at the end of the night. 

The room is located toward the back of the restaurant, closed off from the rest of the tables, but you still get the energy from the music playing.  The room has a TV and audio set up, so you could bring your own music if you really wanted to.  
We used the TV for a slideshow presentation of my sister.  The staff was very helpful and figured out how to set everything up, so it went PERFECTLY!  During the dinner, the slideshow was left on the first photo, so it was a background image of my sister's graduation, which added a nice touch.
The waitress made sure everything was incredible.  She offered several suggestions for us and was always there to fill up our glasses with drinks and water.
We got the Toasts, Artichoke Dip, and Bacon Wrapped Shrimp appetizers -Â all of which was delicious! Everyone at the table got different entrees, which were all eaten up!  The Chimayo Chicken was a hit at out table, as were the seafood options (salmon, mahi mahi, ahi) . 
We had put in a special request that my sister's boyfriend was going to propose that night, so our waitress ensured that everything was PERFECT.  She had the champagne and our cake ready to go when he popped the question.We all agreed that it could not have been a better experience!  

Thank you all for making this an unforgettable evening!
