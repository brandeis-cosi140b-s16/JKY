For all you Rokerij fans and those looking for great food in Phoenix, you must try the new roasted duck with orange chipotle glaze! All I can say is OH MY GOSH! Truly the best duck I have ever had. We came for the happy hour which by the way is awesome but we couldn't resist venturing into the regular menu when there were such interesting options. 
Mike and Brent are great too and very knowledgable! Fabulous experience.
