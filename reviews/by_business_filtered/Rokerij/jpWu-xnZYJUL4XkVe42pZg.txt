Came here during happy hour so you get a few dollars off the small and big plates.

*Mushroom toast - good but nothing special.  Probably won't get again.
* Shrimp Piri Piri - loved the sauce it came in.   Lots of shrimp.
* Bacon-wrapped shrimp - big shrimp.  I didn't think anything of the sauces but the shrimp were really good!  But then again, can you go wrong with wrapping it with bacon?
* Crab Tostadas - mmmm....those were yummy.  Lots of crab and really refreshing.  Definitely one to get again.
* Half order of roasted garlic.  I love roasted garlic but this one wasn't my favorite.  Something about the flavor of the garlic didn't seem right.  It was almost bitter but mild at the same time.
