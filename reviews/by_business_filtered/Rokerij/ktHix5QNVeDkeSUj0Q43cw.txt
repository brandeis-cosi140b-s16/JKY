If you want your out-of-town friends to think you're the cool local - bring them here.  I've lived here for almost 5 years and only recently found out about The Rokerij.  Hell, it took me 5 tries typing the name in the search box to find it on here!

Every time we've gone, we've eaten downstairs in the bar-area.  The crowd is a little more lively.  It's also closer to the alcohol.  As you're walking down it feels like you're in a castle -- everything is stone.  When you enter there's a roaring fire with a few arm chairs around it.  You can eat at the bar, tables, the couch.. the floor I suppose?  Plenty of seating (not JUST a bar)  It's a little like being in a ski lodge.  Anyway.. very cool atmosphere.

I've heard mixed reviews from friends about their entree dishes.  They're a bit expensive.  We usually order a bunch of tapas dishes and share.  The last time we went we had four or five tapas and a bottle of wine.  We spent $60 or so with tip for the three of us and all left with a full stomach and a little hammered.  Great way to start the evening.
