BEWARE...if you want a reservation for less than four people, you are out of luck! Apparently there is one table in the dungeon that is reserved for parties less than four but it was reserved for he night. However, we were invited to sit in the bar...yipeee!!! I think it's good for them that they are busy, but I think they should seriously evaluate how they treat new customers. This place was highly recommended, but impossibly unaccessible.
