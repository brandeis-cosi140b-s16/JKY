Ambiance: we had the private dining room in the back - PLUS
Server: knew every special, could describe chipotle to a tourist from MN - PLUS PLUS

Menu - interesting but not pretentious (big plus in my book)

I know people go there for the southwest cuisine BUT.......I'm going to say go for the FISH. The handling of the swordfish and halibut and scallops was Excellent!  Cooked to perfection, paired with great Fresh sauces or salsas and such a great choice of veggie side dishes - beets!  broccolini!  other interesting stuff!!

You get what you pay for.  Absolutely.  Next time will come much earlier so I can linger in the BAR for awhile - nice!  Adding Rokerij to my list of "take out-of-town guests here so they quit being snarky with me about Az having no interesting cuisine".
