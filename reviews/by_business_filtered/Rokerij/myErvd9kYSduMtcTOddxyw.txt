Ok I love this place!!!! Pick a rainy night when nothing sounds better then cozy-ing up to the fire, listening to great tunes and sipping a fabulous blueberry lemon drop or sophisticated glass of wine and there is no better place to be in Phoenix.  So unique from the big flashy restaurants smattered up and down Scottsdale.  You can dine upstairs, or downstairs at the bar in a bit more casual environment.  I have to admit that I have yet to eat upstairs.  Downstairs, you can get the same menu + and easily fill up on very substantial light fare at a reasonable price.  Try the beef tenderloin toasts and you will come back again and again.  Everyone is so friendly here, from bartenders to patrons.  If only there were more places in phoenix like this! Our own little piece of Aspen - go, go, go.
