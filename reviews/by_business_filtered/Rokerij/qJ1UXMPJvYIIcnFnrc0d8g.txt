I love non-chain restaurants to begin with, and this place exemplifies the attention to detail and wholly pulled-together ambiance that a great one-off place could be. I went with my Dad, who was in town for the day. Bonus points for having a few plasmas playing the ballgame, but not too many. Classy and understated all the way. New Mexico themed fare, whatever that is. It is basically a seafood/steakhouse with a bit of extra spicy kick to everything. I went with the Pasta and Grill, which consisted of a small medallion of steak, some chicken (with the added kick) and swordfish with a spicy chutney over the top. Served over beans and rice, with half the plate offering up some pretty damned tasty penne. Went great with a glass of wine, and not too much damage on the wallet. We got out of there for $60 plus a tip. One of my new favorites. Interesting note; my Dad said if I didn't pull him in here, he would have "driven right by the place and not even knew it was there". On the way out, a busboy stopped my Dad and asked "do I know you from somewhere?" My Dad said he was the guy from the KYOT voice overs, and gave his best "Kay-why-oooooh-teeeeee". Nice.
