I'll admit that I spend more time at the downstairs bar for 1/2 price wine night (Sun. Mon. Tues) than upstairs.  They also have a great $5.00 small plate special during happy hours and reverse happy hours.  The food is good, the ambiance especially downstairs where there is a roaring fire and a large copper bar.  parking can be tight on busy nights but the place is well wroth a wait if there is one.  For a more formal dinner, make reservations and eat upstairs.  Dessert is the one weak point on the menu, (as in it is only so-so) but who cares when there are enchiladas and chile rellenos and brie/mushroom toasts, and vegetable platters, and the best sea bass...but I digress...just head out there!
