Always amazing! Always a wait! Well worth it! I usually order off their specials menu and get seafood and its always on point! The cactus pear margaritas are awesome and I get 1-3 every time! I have yet to try their brunch but heard great things! If you are visiting make it a point to eat here! Understand its not mexican, its New Mexico style which is spicy but flavorful! You can always try the Richardsons or Dicks Hideaway too. A lot of the same things on the menu. My dad always gets the green chile stew or carne adovada when he visits from Chicago which has become quite often since he found this place!
