Phenomenal service, atmosphere and food.  My sweet baboo and I decided to finally check this place out after driving past it a gazillion and a half times. 

The downstairs area was very chill, but we decided to head upstairs to where we thought the magic was happening (we are now convinced that magic happens all over the building... (was that the prickly pear margarita talking? Maybe. But I'd listen to anything that yummy wench has to say, so put that in your pipe). 

We started off with the tenderloin toasts...Scrumptious. Rare/Seared tenderloin with brie and lightly toasted bread (sourdough??)? Yes please. We were going to continue to order small and big plates because everything our server said sounded amazing, but then we saw the pizza portion of the menu and decided to go for it. 

We created a masterpiece!! (Well...I guess the guys in the kitchen helped too): 

Green chile salsa for the base, 
Carne adovada (OMG!), 
Mexican sausage, 
Roasted corn and 
Monterey jack cheese w/ an additional side of that delectible green chile sauce. 

It was...a magnificent pizza. I could just take that carne adovada and eat it out of the pot.  Make sure to look at the walls/chalkboards to see what delicious specials they have. I've heard the bacon wrapped scallops are out of this world.
