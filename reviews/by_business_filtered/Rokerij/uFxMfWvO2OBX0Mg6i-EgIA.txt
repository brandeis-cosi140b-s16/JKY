Wow, I heard about this small restaurant  from a friend at work so we thought we would give it try . We made reservations for Sunday brunch. On the outside it looks like "nothing special" Inside is small, dark and quaint . The food was amazing!! Real New Mexican style. Chips and home made Guacamole...fabulous!! All plates came with homemade fresh beans. My husband had the Cheese Relleno  and I had the Advodaca, they were fabulous!  My daughter who is 14 and a small, tiny thing not only ate her plate but was forking beans from her brothers plate...This is unheard of. We will so be back !
