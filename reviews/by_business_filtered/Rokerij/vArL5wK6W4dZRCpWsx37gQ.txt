Ambiance - great. But WORST. SERVER. EVER.

First time to go to the Rokerij on the recommendation of a friend. Three of us went on a early Sunday afternoon to the downstairs bar/restaurant and were seated in a booth. I had a question about the NM sausage on the brunch menu and the waitress says "I don't know, I've only worked here five days". Period. She doesn't offer to get a sample for me to taste, or even go ask someone who knows about it. Just "I don't know, so live with it".  Then, she refilled my friend's iced tea with water, and was annoyed when was corrected (and had to bring a new glass). She didn't even bring a "new" glass, just the same one she dumped out in the sinkthen refilled. Yuck. I question if that's even legal/sanitary.
Finally, we paid $50 cash towards a bill that was just over $40 and she never came back with change. As we continually attempted to flag her down or make eye contact, we could tell she was just waiting for us to leave so she could give herself a big tip. When finally confronted (WE had to go to HER), she said, "Oh, I wasn't sure what the extra $10 was for (so I kept it)." Umm, the bill was for $40.44, not $40! That's what the extra $10 was for! I guess she expects the register will never close with the correct amount, or when in the same situation she just stiffs the restaurant for that extra amount?
We definitely won't be going here again - there are plenty of other places nearby with same quality of food AND great service.
