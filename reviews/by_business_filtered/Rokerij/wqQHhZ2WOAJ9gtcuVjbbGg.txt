Ditto to everyone else's comments thus far.

We dropped in for a drink the other night and were very pleasantly surprised with how hidden and cool the underground bar was. They also have Chimay on tap??? That's hard to mess with. 

We had already eaten a big dinner so we didn't go there but even a cursory glance at the menu left me inspired to come back soon. And I'm sure their cuisine won't fall far from the Richardson's tree, which is a very good thing, in my book.
