This is one of my favorite restaurants in PHX. The food is always perfectly cooked and the atmosphere is just my speed, especially when it's a chilly night and the fire is going downstairs. Always have great service and from the looks of the clientele around me, it's a popular place  for date night. Try something with both the red and the green sauce to see which you like better and try a green chile potato as a side. The prime rib is one of the best you'll ever eat. 

If nothing else, come in for the fact that you can be seated in one of the handful of basements in Arizona.
