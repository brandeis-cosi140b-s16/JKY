The BEST espresso martini in the city...... hands down!  The best time to go is for Happy Hour downstairs.  Can't beat the 1/ 2 price appetizers.  & everything on the menu is delicious.  & I have sampled most of it!
For a romantic dinner, try the upstairs dining room.  There isn't anything bad about this place......... well, maybe except the parking.
