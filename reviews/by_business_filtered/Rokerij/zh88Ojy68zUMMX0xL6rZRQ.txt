Picked here for my birthday dinner w/ my family since I'd never been...everything was amazing.  We had about 8 of us so we ordered a few appetizers to start: the ceviche, steak skewers and calamari...all amazing.  My aunt and I split two fish specials - halibut and salmon, both were cooked perfectly and we picked the side of spicy potatoes stuffed in a green pepper.  Yummm. Someone else got one of the pizzas which was delicious with goat cheese and garlic, my brother got the meat trio special and was in heaven.  Then we got a tiramisu and creme brulee for dessert, the creme brulee was everyone's favorite -- vanilla bean flavor with berries.  Oh and the wine was half-off since it was a Monday so we had two bottles and also got one to go.  A really good red, I forget what kind.
