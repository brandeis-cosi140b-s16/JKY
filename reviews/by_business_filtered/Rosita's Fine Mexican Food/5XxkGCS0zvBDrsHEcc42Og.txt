This place has been here forever. and it hasn't changed at all it seems. It wouldn't really be THAT bad if it wasn't for the fact that EVERY damned thing you order is oversalted to the point of insanity. It's crazy! And my girlfriend is a salt fiend....she really loves it! But even she couldn't stomach that much oversalting. It seems to be the only trick the kitchen knows! And you can see the evidence on every table...completely full salt shakers, that likely never need refilling. A person would have to be mad to actually add additional salt to their food here. There are much better Mexican food places around- try Susie's Mexican cafe, up the street on University.
