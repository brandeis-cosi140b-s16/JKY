One of my favorite Arizona style Mexican joints. Their chips are always hot and fresh made. Their salsa is nice and spicy. The red is a little smoky. The green is hot and flavorful. Their guac, if you order it, is fresh made and tasty.They have a few stand out items on the menu.

Albondingas Soup - mexican meatball soup. It's about $5, huge, comes with a plate of refried beans and warm tortillas, your choice of corn or flour. (Corn, bishes!#@) Delicious, filling, and relatively healthy. 

Tamales. I love their green corn tamales. They have green sauce on them and some hot chile inside. Yum!

Short ribs. Yup. Grilled and very meaty. Delicious.

Enchiladas. Perfect.

If you like menudo, you can order it with or without the hoof. I don't like medudo or hooves, so you're on your own, but it seems popular with patrons who have that inverse make a run for the border vibe.

The reviewers who panned this place must have smoked crack before visiting. Or filed the wrong report at the wrong place. They can't be talking about Rositas!
