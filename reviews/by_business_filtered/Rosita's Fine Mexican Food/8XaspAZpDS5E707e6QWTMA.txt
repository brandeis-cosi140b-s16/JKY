five of us from the office went out to celebrate a new client contract and Rosita's is close to the office - the margarita's were good, the service was good, the food was good, and the chips and salsa were good.  the shredded beef chimichanga I had was as good as Macayo's, where the price is 25% higher.
the enchilada sauce could have been Kroger's brand - the salsa made up for it.  my friend gave me a bite of her tamale and it was very good. 
- So, basically, ya pays ya money and ya takes ya chances
