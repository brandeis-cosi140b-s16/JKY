This place first of all is way over priced for simple food, service is poor and the food just has no taste, I had the  chicken enchiladas lunch special the only good thing was the size of the enchiladas were decent but the bad is only one side for 10 buck rice or beans all Mexican places come with both...also had a burger but they wanna charge 2.50 for fries that should come in my 11$ dollar plate .. I went in a group of people from work nobody was happy
