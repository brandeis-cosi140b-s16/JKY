I had a tamale combo here with a friend. It was okay, I've had much better for around $12. The tamale was kind of "fluffy," there was hardly any meat inside. Beans were very standard, chips and salsa were okay. The water was absolutely horrible though. It tasted like how sewage would taste.

I probably wouldn't come back.
