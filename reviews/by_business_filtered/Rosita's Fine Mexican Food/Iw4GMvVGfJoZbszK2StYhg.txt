What was that freaking smell? Holy crap. Smelled like a dirty diaper wrapped in farts. Permeated the entire restaurant. Sure didn't do much to make the greasy over-priced food any more appetizing, I'll tell you that. Thought maybe it was a one-time thing, but after a quick scan of a couple previous reviews, it seems to be a recurring theme with this place. Yuck.
