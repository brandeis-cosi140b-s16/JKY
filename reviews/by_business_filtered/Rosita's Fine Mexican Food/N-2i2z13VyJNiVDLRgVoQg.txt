Service: Good, very quick at refilling chips as soon as you get low. Chips and salsa were actually already set at the table for us when we were seated, which was nice.

Food: Fish tacos were bland. Quesadillas are extremely lacking. Don't bother with them as you can get a better one literally anywhere else. Guacamole looks like runny green poo. Other items I've tried tasted pretty standard - not stand out or especially delicious, but edible.

Ambience: Large restaurant, always somewhat busy for lunch. Feels a bit dingy though.

Verdict: Mediocre. If you're not set on Mexican food I would suggest going next door to Cornish Pasty Co instead.
