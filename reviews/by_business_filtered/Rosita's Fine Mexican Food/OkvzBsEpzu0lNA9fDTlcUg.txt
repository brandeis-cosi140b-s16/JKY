I was in the area for a business meeting and a co-worker and I went in to grab a quick lunch.  The service was quick which is about the only positive thing you will read in this review.

Upon being taken into the front room to be seated the first thing I noticed was the extreme heat.  I alerted the hostess to the issue and she said that it was a hot room and would seat us elsewhere.  The other bigger room was cooler, but far from comfortable.  I am sorry but not having good air conditioning in Tempe/Phoenix is unacceptable.

Figuring we could manage the heat, we ordered guacamole to start.  I am an avocado lover and consequently eat guacamole all the time.  I have NEVER seen guacamole like this before.  It looked puke green and was completely pureed, the consistency of liquidy sour-cream.

In addition to the guacamole, we also ordered a quesadilla.  How hard is it to make a decent quesadilla? Whatever the case, Rosita's quesadilla was cold, hard, and seemed like it was just reheated from the day before.  

We paid without eating 98% of the food.  I will never return to Rosita's. Disgusting hot dump.
