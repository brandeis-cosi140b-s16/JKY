This was my first "Mexican" restaurant after I moved here. Eh, it was OK. I was expecting more. Considering that when you're from Pittsburgh, the closest thing to Mexican is Taco Bell. Ha. I went with the safe bet, Carne Asada, which I'd never heard of, but sounded good . It was good but, not enough to bring me back. Besides, I like the risk factor of Fili-Bs :D
