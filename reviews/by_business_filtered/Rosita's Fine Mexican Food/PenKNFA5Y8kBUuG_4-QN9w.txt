I have since returned to Rosita's after my bad/mediocre experience and it seems to be just fine.  Just fine as in it would be amazing if located in a northern state, but here in Arizona where delicious Mexican food is plentiful, it doesn't stand out.  

I appreciate that they offer two types of beans rather than just the standard refried variety.  The service and food have been fine lately.
