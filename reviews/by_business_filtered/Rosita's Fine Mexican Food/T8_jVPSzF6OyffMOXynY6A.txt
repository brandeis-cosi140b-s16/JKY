The only redeeming thing about Rositas is the free chips and salsa.  I grew up coming here all the time but my family switched to a different Mexican restaurant due to the mediocre food served here.

If I am craving salsa I stop in for happy hour and order a cheese crisp and eat it with refried beans and tons of salsa.
