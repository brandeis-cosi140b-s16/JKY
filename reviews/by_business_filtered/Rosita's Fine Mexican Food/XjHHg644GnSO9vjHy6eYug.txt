This place is good for local and fast Mexican food. Better than Macayo's or Filiberto's. The atmosphere is relaxing and I like that they have daily specials. There is an interesting story behind Rosita's. Mama Rosa opened the first restaurant in the 60s and it was very small with only four tables. Now it's much bigger and they still use her recipes. Yum! Now I want a chimichanga.
