Excellent food, great service. I don't like it when people say that Rosita's isn't authentic, or that it's just 'mediocre' as far as the food. I've had authentic Mexican food cooked in authentic Mexican households, and Rosita's is comparable. It's border food. If you're going for authentic, try some of the higher end dishes, like the carne asada or the carnitas. 

Go for Happy Hour if you go for anything. The appetizers are cheap and plentiful, and the drink specials really roll around to some good stuff. I've gone there for dollar beers before. Terrific.
