Don't listen to the yelp haters, this place is fantastic....good food great service...the  bartender Nessy is wonderful and deserves a raise! Can't beat the chips and salsa and happy hour prices!! Been coming here weekly since first finding out about this place. Do yourself a favor and get over there!
