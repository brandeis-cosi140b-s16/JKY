Our meal started out great with tasty margaritas and above-average nachos. The real downfall was the chicken tostada, which was made with canned chicken!  Seriously, neither of us could eat it. 

To add insult to injury, our waiter totally forgot about us so it took 45 minutes to get the check. At least they told the lousy tostada off the check!
