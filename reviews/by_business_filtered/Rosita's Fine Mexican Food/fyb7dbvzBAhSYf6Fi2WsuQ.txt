Never again rositas!! My husband and I ordered some food for take-out Monday night for mindless football grub. We ordered two carne asada burritos, one with black beans and rice, and two beef tacos a la carte. The tacos were $5 a piece, and we're tiny! I'm sorry, but for $5 I could buy a much better taco at a gourmet taco restaurant. The burritos were also small and over-priced at $9.95. The black beans were an absolute joke; they literally emptied a can of beans into a container, with all the fluid that should be discarded when rinsing beans. Neither of us took a bite of those, and they ended up right in the trashcan.  The chips that came with our order were completely stale and chewy. The meat inside the burrito was tasty, so they can keep one star. Next time I want crappy Mexican food, I'll head to fillibertos and save myself $30.
