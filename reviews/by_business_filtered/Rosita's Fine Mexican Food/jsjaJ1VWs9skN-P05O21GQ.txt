Terrible, this is just about the worst Mexican I've had in AZ. And that includes Taco Bell. Granted, standards for anything Latin are pretty high in Phoenix, but I couldn't imagine people would enjoy this place no matter where they're from. My company orders lunch here from time to time, so I'm forced to eat it or *gasp* pay for my own lunch. Yet this is the one place we order from that I actually consider sitting out for. The portions are tiny, it's kinda expensive and the small amount of food you do get is bland and gross. There are so many good Mexican restaurants in the Valley, don't waste your time.
