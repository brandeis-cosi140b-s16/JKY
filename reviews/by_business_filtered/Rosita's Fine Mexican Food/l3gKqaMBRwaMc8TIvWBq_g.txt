My wife and I were only in Phoenix for a night, and figured we would try some Mexican food  seeing as we had never been in the Southwest before.  Our 1st restaurant down the street never got around to serving us, so we came to Rosalita`s figuring it might have authentic Mexican cuisine.

It was brutal.

The service was atrocious, as one poor guy was working both the bar and the "lounge" area which had about 8 tables full.  He was pleasant, but completely overwhelmed.

The food itself tasted as if it had been left out all day and simply reheated.  The chips were stale and the salsa tasted suspiciously like the crappy Ortega stuff you buy in the supermarket.  My shrimp dish was so disastrous that I only ate half of it because I was afraid it might make me sick.  The shrimp were overcooked to the point of turning into rubber, and the sauce was nauseating.  The rice was overcooked and dry, and the green salad of lettuce and carrots was steamed!   This was without a doubt the worst mexican I have ever eaten in my life.

My wife thought her tacos were bland, but much more edible than my shrimp, even though the cheese was not authentic, or tasty at all.
