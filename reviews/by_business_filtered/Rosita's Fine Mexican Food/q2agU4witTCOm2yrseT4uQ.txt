My husband and I were in town for spring training and Rosita's was suggested by our hotel.  This was our first visit and will be our last.  I should have known something wasn't right by the smell that overwhelmed us when we walked in the door. Something must have died, it was terrible.  We waited then waited while the hostess had her back to us while taking a phone order.  She was so surprised when she turn around to see us and 3 other groups waiting to be seated.  We were seated in the bar area and met by a pleasant waiter who clearly was overwhelmed.  My margarita was delicious wish I had another but after delivering our order we never saw our busy waiter again.  I had the green tamale, and it was very good.  Unfortunately, that tamale wasn't good enough to overcome the negatives.
