Awesome food!!! The wait can be long though you can call ahead and make reservations.  Our waitress was older Mexican woman with a man look on her face.  She reminded me of my grandma.  

The plates are LARGE so..come hungry or eat left overs the next day.

I ordered the tostadas- they were huge and so yummy.  The strawberry lemonade was the bomb!
