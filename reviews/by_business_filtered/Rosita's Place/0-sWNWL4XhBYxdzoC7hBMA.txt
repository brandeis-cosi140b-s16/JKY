I drive by Rosita's all the time-- and have never stopeed to go in... until 2 days ago and I am so glad I did.  It looks really tiny from McDowell but actually it is a pretty decent size.  I ordered the good ol standby: beef taco and cheese enchilada and rice.  I was very pleased with my meal.  It was affordable and tasty.  I will go back again.  The only drawback is the pond inside-- things like that skeeve me out. Service was normal, food came quickly (like most Mexican food places) and the chips were good- warm when delivered and the salsa was great!
