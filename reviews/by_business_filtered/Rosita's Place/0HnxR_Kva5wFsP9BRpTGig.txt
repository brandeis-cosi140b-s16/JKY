Chips were Hot & Fresh...Very Hot! The food was wonderful. Our order was somewhat lost in translation. Our sever asked us again if that is what we wanted. I said yes. We got enough food for 4 people. We got the plates of tacos rather than 2 individual tacos! These plates include beans and rice of course. I did not even dig in to my Chimichanga, as I was so full of chips & salsa, and my tacos of course. The d√©cor is very simple, and the seating/booths are very basic. You are not going here for the local ambiance; you are going to come here for the Yummy Mexican Food! I will go back!
