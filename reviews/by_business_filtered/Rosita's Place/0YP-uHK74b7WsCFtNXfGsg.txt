This is the real-deal Mexican food in Arizona. (Not to be confused with Rosita's local chain of restaurants.) Home-cooked goodness. Freshly cooked chips, spicy red and green salsa. Try the chicken chilie relleno or a green chili burro enchilada style.  For you meat purists, check out the sauteed beef burro or the carnitas burro(!). It's all soooo good - not a bad item on the menu. Go to Rosita's Place - you'll be glad you did.
