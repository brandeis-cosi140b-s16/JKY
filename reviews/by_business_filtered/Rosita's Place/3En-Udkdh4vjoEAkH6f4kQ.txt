We have been going there for years, and putting up with poor service because the food was good.  Our recent visit was our last.  The waitresses all act like they are exasperated that they have to wait on us, bordering on rude.  We try an experiment every time we go in.  We watch numerous customers come in WAY after us, and order AFTER us, and get their food BEFORE us.  We chalk this up to only one thing.  We are white, and the others getting better service are hispanic.

Now that the food is not satisfactory, I see no reason to go back.  My beef taco was a mixture of mealy beef and chunks of potato.  It was so disgusting I couldn't even eat it.  There has been a definite change in the food from years ago.  Yuk.  There are plenty of better places out now that have better quality food and GREAT service.
