The first time I went here, everything was absolutely spectacular. No complaints at all. 

Went here for the second time, last week and found myself far less satisfied than my first visit. There are not many vegetarian options, which is normally ok for me. I'm not difficult to please. Unfortunately, if I'm ordering a vegetarian dish, I'd really prefer not to find meat in it. This distinctly tainted my views on the place and I will not be going back here.
