Consistently satisfying. You know it's going to be good when the tortilla chips (1st basket comp., nominal charge for add'l.) are delivererd too hot to touch at first, lightly salted, with 2 choices, red or green salsa. The combo plates are generously portioned, flavorful, perfectly-balanced, complex in seasoning, comfort food. STRONG margaritas. Watch out! Never get "adverse side effects" from eating Mexican food here. A little pricey, but worth it. Take relatives visiting from out-of-state here for an authentic Mexican restaurant experience.
