Pretty authentic and they have menu items that other restaurants don't. The posole, vegetable soup, and menudo are available on certain days...all pretty good. On weekends, it gets busy, so it's best to get there early. When I'm craving a sit down Mexican meal, Rosita's my first choice when I'm in Central Phoenix.
