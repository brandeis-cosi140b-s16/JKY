I really wanted Chilaquiles when i got there but i also wanted Menudo.  I ended up ordering the Red Menudo and it was really good.  There was no fat in it and most places give you a lot of fat in your bowl.  I did need to use the restroom seeing as i am pregnant after the meal, but the stahl was locked from the inside. I told the front desk but they didn't do anything about it at the moment so i had to stop somewhere else.  The food service was great otherwise.
