my fiance and i are huge fans of mexican food and there's rarely a time that we're not in the mood to eat it.  when a friend told me they served a speciality frozen horchata drink, i knew we had to check it out.

the frozen horchata is served as a cocktail, and you have the option of getting it with either rum or vodka.  we opted to try both, and they were amazing! i definitely preferred the drink with vodka since it didn't take away from the flavor of the horchata like the rum did. after finishing his drink, my fiance ordered a jamaica margarita with chili on the rim.  i had a couple sips of it and it might have been better than the horchata! 

chips and salsa can really make or break a mexican place for me, so i really appreciated that their chips were hot and salty while the salsas (red and green) were spicy and delicious.  

i ordered the chile relleno, and it came out super hot and covered in tons of cheese. i really enjoyed the flavors of it, and was sad that i could only eat about a third of the meal.  the standard bean and rice sides were also really tasty and better than i've had in a while. 

i will be definitely adding this place to my regular mexican restaurant rotation!
