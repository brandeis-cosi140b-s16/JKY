I came in on a weekday evening and was surprised to see menudo available, as most places only serve it on Saturdays! I ordered the menudo roja with pata (pig's feet) extra. The soup came out hot with a generous amount of tripe and hominy. It was initially not as spicy as I expected but that was easily remedied with provided spices, limes, cilantro, and chopped onions. Service is excellent with friendly and prompt wait staff. The chips and salsa are served fresh. They serve Pepsi products at this restaurant. Will certainly come back next time I am in the Phoenix area!
