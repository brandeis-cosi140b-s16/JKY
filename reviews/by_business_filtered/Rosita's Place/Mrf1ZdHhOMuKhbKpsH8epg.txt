Tremendously spicy salsa, my mouth was burning but it was so good I kept going back for more. I ordered the bean and cheese burrito (that was no burrito, burro muy grande) enchilada style. I could actually taste the lard in the beans. I ate half and took the rest home. 

Healthy? No! Cheap and delicious. Si! I will be back.
