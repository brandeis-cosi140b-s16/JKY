This is one of my favorite restaurants when visiting Phoenix. The place doesn't look like much, but the food is really good. We have a lot of good Mexican and Tex Mex places in Dallas and I still rate this highly. I recommend either the chicken burrito or if you are up for it, the chicken chimichanga. There is something about how they make the chicken there that is the best I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant. They don't put anything but meat in the burritos, so get them with the green chile sauce and definitely order it "enchilada" style (melted cheese). The refried beans are great too. Others I've gone with love the pork carnitas.
