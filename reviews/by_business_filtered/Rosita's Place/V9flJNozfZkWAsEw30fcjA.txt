How have I driven by this place so many times? I never knew such good food awaited me inside this little shop as I drove by.
Wow, when my girlfriend was really sick a few weeks ago her close friend took us Rositas for some spicey healing food.
Chips and salsa were really good. Fresh hot chips,that they make right there in store.
Along with 2 delish salsas.
We got the best Chicken soup I have ever had in my life. Yes, better than my Mothers. But, do not tell her. I don't want to hurt her feelings.

Each of our soups had a full chicken breast inside. The broth was amazing.
Our meal was amazing and more than I could eat. 
By that night my girlfriend felt like a new person, it really was the healing food.
Recently I stopped in a little short of time and got an order to go.
Again fantastic ,hot ,delish food.
The ladies that work there are so sweet as well!
This is so good and so inexspensive as well. I sort of hate to share my new find,because, it will get really busy and I won't find a seat. 
But you will love this place.
