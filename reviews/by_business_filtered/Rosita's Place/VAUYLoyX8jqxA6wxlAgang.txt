I lived in Phoenix for 12 years before I found this place - now I would never recommend any Mexican restaurant but this one for friends from out of town or newbies.  Rosita's chips are the best - it's worth a trip just for the chips.  I usually eat there at least once a week - the cheese enchiladas with green sauce are my favorite, but occasionally I stray and have never had anything that isn't wonderful.  If you like soup it's also the place to go - surprising for a Mexican restaurant, but soups are amazing.
