After hours upon hours (jk) of reviewing potential places to have a delicious authentic Mexican meal, we decided on this place. We were visiting from Philly and couldn't leave Phoenix without eating the real deal, forget Taco Bell (ha ha I know that's not real food, ijs!)
Anyway what a beautiful culinary experience! The food was fresh and piping hot and FAST! I only ate about 3 chips looked up and my dinner was there! Huge portions, pretty food, reasonably priced, nice ambience, service a little curt but who cares, I'm an East Coast gal anyway so I'm used to it!
