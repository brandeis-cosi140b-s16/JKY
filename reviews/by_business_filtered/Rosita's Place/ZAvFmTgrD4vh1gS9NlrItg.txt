Hey Yall...i knew i would find EXACTLY what I was looking for...I want to tell me peers when they fly in, but I want to keep her a secret....I LOVE ROSITAS...Carmen was my prompt and courteous server...i I ordered the carne asada burrito enchilada style with rice and beans it came with a side of guacamole and a little lettuce salad. The Carne Asada Steak inside of this burrito was totally undeniably freakin awesome, awesome like a FOODGASM in my mouth the meat was tender, flavorful, juicy, and I could see & taste the spices WHERE IN THE HELL do they do that at well let me tell you ROSITAS. This has to be one of the best things I've ever eaten since I've been in Phoenix, Arizona. The mom and pop setting remind me of home the loud crazy people didn't bother me it's a small restaurant it's time to be expected. Don't do yourself an injustice by leaving if it's crowded what are your items to go. I love guacamole but I didn't enjoy this one because I could tell they add Southwest spices and I like mine plain.
