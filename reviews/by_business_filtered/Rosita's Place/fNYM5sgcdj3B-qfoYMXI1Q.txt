My family and I have been coming here for years during lunchtime. Chiqui has been our staple here and has always done a wonderful job of entertaining and servicing our needs.

I order anything from the Tamales to the Fajitas, they really serve quality Sonoran style Mexican Food here.

I recommend this establishment to anyone and will always come back.
