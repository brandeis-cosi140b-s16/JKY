i've only been here a few times for take out, so i can't speak for the service.  my food was TERRIFIC-- especially the carne asada burros and guacamole-- and ready for me when i arrived.  the salsas (i loooooved the green) were good as well.  i've eaten a lot of mexican food in my day, and this was top notch.
