Once again ... the negative reviews by fellow yelpers ... can be so lame. Talk about first world problems, here. 

News flash: mexican food can be very unhealthy. Especially tortilla chips that arrive to the table so piping hot that you have to wait for them to cool down before indulging. Salty, spicy hot, warm, crunch.

The mol√© here is the only one that is as delicious as my mom's mole. Seriously that good. The margaritas are stiff and delish. This place is here for the food, not the service ... though the service has always been great.  

This restaurant is one of the best of it's kind. Major bonus: if you want to hear music, play it on the jukebox. Totally off the wall eclectic selection, gotta love it.
