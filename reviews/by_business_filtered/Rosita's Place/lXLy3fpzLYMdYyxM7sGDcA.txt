I've been in DC for nearly five years now and every now and then, I still get an incredible craving for Rosita's Place.  I miss the salsa verde.  I miss the albondigas soup.  I miss the bean and cheese burritos enchilada style.  Sigh.  

Nothing on this coast even comes close to the quality, authentic Mexican food this joint offers.  It's the first stop I make whenever I return to the Valley.  

Get past the surly wait staff and the worn exterior.

This place will not let you down.
