Been coming here since the original building wad located much closer to sky harbor. 
I've even driven family here from tucson as I feel there is nothing local to compare it to.

Whatever is ordered is sure to be a winner.  My personal favorite is the taco toscada and enchilada with rice and beans.  No visit would be complete without the cooked to order tortilla chips with the house made red and green salsa
