I visited Phoenix a few years ago for a gig (coming from LA). Had another musician friend who lived there turn me on to this place - awesome! Love the food and the divey ambience. If you're looking for fancy go somewhere else. If you're looking for authentic quality food this is the place. Absolutely delicious and I remember it still after 5+ years.
