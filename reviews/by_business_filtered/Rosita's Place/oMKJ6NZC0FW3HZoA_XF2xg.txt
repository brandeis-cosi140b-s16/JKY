Rosita's Place Rocks! It has the right amount of dive atmosphere with just excellent food. The green & red sauce are both pretty hot and spicy Chips are fresh and fried on premises. All entrees are quite big and enough to feed two. It draws interesting crowd. I was there with some folks from work after a conference and so were in suits. There were some families, retired folks, emo-kids and bubbas. Try the combination burro with enchilada sauce. Can't go wrong with that. Beer and tequila is reasonably price.
