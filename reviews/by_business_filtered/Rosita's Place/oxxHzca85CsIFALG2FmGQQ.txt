I have been going to this restaurant for several years, and probably always will come back. The food is wonderful with large portions, definitely going to have left overs. Slight complaint, they are always very busy, and with the place being small it can get pretty loud and tight. Also, a lot of the staff are hard to understand, the language barrier is noticeable. Worth the drive to try it out, I highly recommend it, just get there before you're starving in case there is a line!
