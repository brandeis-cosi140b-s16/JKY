Good was amazing as I had heard on here thanks guys. I got the chimichanga amazing in fact it was way to much I had to take the rest home. My girlfriend had ordered the menudo and she also thought it was very good just that they did not have any bread to go along with it. Now to the bad things as soon as I came in we had asked for a table the lady said to just sit there pointed and didn't bring any menus or even show us to our table. Our server granted she was slightly busy no more than a diner I think checked on us once. Overall 3 stars just because the front personel really did upset me
