Location, location, location...  Yes, the type of service you receive at Rosita's all depends upon where you sit.  My experience:  4 visits sitting in the bar = great service.  1 visit sitting in the dining room = painfully slow service.  So, the bar is definitely the way to go, and not just because it offers closer access to the margaritas.  ;)

Now that we have that out of the way, let me tell you about the three main reasons I love Rosita's:

Hot, salty tortilla chips with spicy salsa - the perfect starter that sets up the appetite perfectly for...

Powerful and potent margaritas - the super nice female bartender is not skimpy on the tequila in these!

And, best of all, the most wonderful carne asada burro I have ever experienced.  This is not your average burro with a bit of meat and lots of 'filler' - rice, etc.  No, this is an enormous tortilla packed with meat, meat and more meat!  If you get it enchilada-style like I do, it will be topped with a delightfully messy mix of cheese and red sauce.  Bite after bite of goodness!

So, clear your afternoon (those margaritas pack a kick!), grab a friend or two and get going!
