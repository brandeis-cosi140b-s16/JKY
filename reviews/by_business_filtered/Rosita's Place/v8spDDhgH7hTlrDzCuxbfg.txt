Pros:  Chips, salsas, beans, green chili, BIG tacos, great prices/value.

Cons:  Ground beef was mush, rice was meh.

Bottom line:    In my longstanding quest to find a go-to Mexican joint in central Phoenix, Rosita's emerges as a leading contender.   

The chips are made fresh to order ($1 for a big basket) and go great with the salsas, and even better with a side of beans.  About the beans:  they're as good as advertised, with a salty/creamy (but not textureless) combo that's bliss.  Too bad the rice was so ordinary and bland.  But no one has big expectations for Mexican style rice, so only a small knock here.

The green chili burro ($5, additional $3 for beans and rice) is top notch, near Rito's in quality, but with a better construction.  Tender and spicy and not too soupy to soak through the tortilla.  Generous portion, too. 

For kicks I also ordered a crunchy taco with ground beef and potato.  On the good side, it was BIG for $2.60, and full of goodies, lots of cheese and a good but not excessive helping of lettuce.  Good value.  On the downside, the flavor and texture were very disappointing.  They blended the beef and potatoes together to make it a pasty mix.  Not appetizing at all.

My friend got a chicken taco and enchilada and said the chicken was particularly flavorful and tasted like it was braised, which is uncommon in a town where most Mexican places boil and shred their chicken.

The atmosphere inside is perfectly respectable for this kind of restaurant.  The neighborhood isn't great, but it's a well lit parking lot and there's an attendant watching the premises and the parking lot.  So there's that.
