I've been dining at Rosita's Place since the 80s.  It's probably my favorite Mexican restaurant overall.  Here's what I love:
Green corn tamales
Red sauce
Green sauce
Chili relleno
Wait staff (often the same waitresses who served in the 80s!)
Mariachis
Insanely large glass of iced tea
Atmosphere

I think Rosita's Place is the real deal.  It's not healthy food; it may not be particularly inventive food.  But it is done well, in a friendly environment.
