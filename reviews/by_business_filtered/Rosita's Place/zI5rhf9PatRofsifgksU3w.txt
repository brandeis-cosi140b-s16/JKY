I'm not going to say there are alot of Mexican restaraunts in the valley. I believe that has been mentioned before. I ended up at Rosita's Place because a co-worker was meeting someone there. I doubt I would have dropped in on my own. Upon walking in, I was turned off by their signs about what they will not do. They will not split the check. They charge for the chips. I was prepared for a bad experience.

Rosita's Place is now on my "A" lunch circuit. I agree that the service was not world class, but the portions were generous and the food was delicious. As seen on other reviews for Rosita's, both the green and red salsas packed a heck of a kick. Unfettered, I ordered the Camarones a Diablo (Devil's Shrimp). It came after a longer than average wait, and it was a spicy, tasty meal. The chips came out very hot and fresh, and my lunch partners dishes looked equally appetizing.

Give Rosita's Place a shot, you will not regret it.
