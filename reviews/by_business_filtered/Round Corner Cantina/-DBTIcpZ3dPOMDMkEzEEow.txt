I really dig this place! The vibe, the decor, the bartenders- all very cool, real and genuine.  Honestly, it kind-of reminds me of an LA bar- with the latin flavor.

I love the Cantina Margarita, simple and good and $6.  Perfect.  Some decent beer on tap, standard beers here in bottles and cans, plus a plethora of liquors; including some tequilas I did not think that they would have- namely, Cazadores.

I have never eaten here, but the tacos looked pretty good.  My fiance and I often come in and grab a drink while we are waiting for our table at Piccolo Forno.

Anyways, yes- love it.
