Had thee worst server ever... She started off sweet but as the night went on she had an attitude she didn't get the drink I ordered not one but two times, I had to go to the bar. I asked to return the food I ordered and she made a smart remark about me eating two. My friend had one and I of course ate one but just didn't like them. 5 of the 7 of us that were there are servers ourselves and we know if you have an attitude you don't show it to customers, that's how you make tips. No one at our table was rude so her attitude was unnecessary I was highly disappointed in the service that we received.
