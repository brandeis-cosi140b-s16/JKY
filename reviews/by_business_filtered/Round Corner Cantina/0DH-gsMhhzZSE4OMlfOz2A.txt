Great bar, and very good ambience. Lively crowd, a bit noisy - but, eh, it's a bar as much as a restaurant. It's not big, and I suppose it can get crowdy and packed, although it was not bad when i went there this Friday. So, a good place to spend your evening.

So why 3 stars only? 

I would have given 4 stars for the bar itself, but I am just rating the food and drinks here. The slow roasted pork tacos were good and tasty, but quite fat. I was afraid if the the pork were to touch my clothes, they would be stained permanently! Some will like that, others won't. The fish tacos were bland. 

So, overall, not bad, and better than other mexican places in Pittsburgh, but you won't go there for the tacos. 

Also, sadly, my margarita was quite small, and I could barely feel the tequila.

They don't have a waiting list, so you have to wait for a table. The dining area is small, and you may have to wait during the week end. 

I'll be back, and I'll probably eat there again. And as I said, that's really a great bar.
