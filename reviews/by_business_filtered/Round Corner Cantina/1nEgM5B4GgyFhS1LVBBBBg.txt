Great neighborhood spot. I've been coming here since it was old, ultra-divey Sufak's with the horseshoe pit out back. Yes, there are hipsters and yes, there are yupsters. Get into it or get over it. But the drinks are for real and Kendal holds it down behind the bar. Awesome guacamole and the best patio in the summertime.  And I love that, at the end of the day, this is a bar. It is not kid-friendly but a place for grown folks. Thanks for keeping it that way.
