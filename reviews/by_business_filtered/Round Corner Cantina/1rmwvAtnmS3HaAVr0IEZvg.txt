Vintage decor? Check. Noise level? Perfect. Ambient lighting? Ideal. Guacamole and salsa? Excellent. Chips? Fresh, but extremely oily. Fish tacos? Delicious. Margaritas? Quite drinkable. Best pollo verde tacos in the city, hands down!

I'm lowering my rating to four stars due to their extremely oily chips which I have learned to avoid. This unfortunately makes it impossible to enjoy their excellent salsas and guacamole.

PS: the tacos come on dual layered corn tortillas. This is apparently quite a difficult concept for other Pittsburgh restaurants to grasp.
