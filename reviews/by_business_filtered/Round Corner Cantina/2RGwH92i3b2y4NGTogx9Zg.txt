Hands-down probably my favorite place to go out in Pittsburgh. It's got such a cool, hip(ster) feel with nice bartenders and an excellent space. The food is some of the best cheap Tex-Mex that I've had since I've been here, with amazing seitan tacos that I get almost every time I'm there. The chips, salsa, and amazing guac are an excellent way to start out, and the margaritas here (as well as Mad Mex) are in my opinion the best (and strongest) in the city. This place has probably the coolest and largest outdoor patio in the city, with many large tables for big groups, beautiful lights, and even at outdoor bar for all of your needs. The service at times can be slow, and it takes a while to get a drink at the front bar, but this doesn't matter too much because you will have an amazing time either way! Definitely stop by for karaoke on Thursday nights!
