My boyfriend and I LOVE this place. The service is not slow or bad, they are just laid back about it. The drinks are amazing and they use fresh ingredients for the mojitos and the chips there are the best chips I've ever eaten. They are homemade and delightful! The salsa trio or guacamole go with them great! The sangria is also very good and the 'el camino' margarita. Also a few good wines on the list that I always order. Patio is such a nice atmosphere and the cantina would not have such a great crowd and demand for seats if it wasn't good!
