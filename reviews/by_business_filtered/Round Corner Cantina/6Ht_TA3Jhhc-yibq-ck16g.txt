This is a place I find myself at on many a Thursdays after 9 for Karaoke.  They also have $4 sangria on special.  I love sangria and as awesome as it is served in a mason jar, it is just not good.  Very disappointing with the flavor and amount of alcohol in it.  This place is located on Butler street and super cute inside with an amazing outdoor seating area!  On my last visit we sat outside, they have plenty of seats covered and uncovered with a small outdoor bar.  We ordered a pitcher of margaritas which was a little pricey at $27 for the basic flavor but we did get about 6 glasses out of it.  It is interesting that they put OJ in all their margaritas- I like the sour taste of margaritas so the added sweetness was not for me.  The food is what you would expect at any average Mexican place in Pittsburgh. Love the queso dip and guacamole. The tacos have lots of fresh veggies. To get the most out of your visit, I recommend going in the summer to sit outside for a drink
