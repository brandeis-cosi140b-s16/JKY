I love this place!

The best Mexican food I have found in Pittsburgh so far, hands down.  The tacos are creative and tasty and the rest of the menu is great as well. And they make the best tamales I have ever had.  On a nice night, the patio is a great place to eat, too!

If you go on a busy night the service might be a little slow, but I don't fault them for this.  (Any time we've gone on a weeknight the service is quite fast.)  Sometimes the waitstaff is a little... "eccentric," we have had a waitress a few times that calls us "lady" and "man," which I find a bit weird, but she is attentive and otherwise friendly.

If you are a big eater, you could spend a bit of money here before you get full...  The booze is a bit pricey and they charged me for seltzer water (REALLY?) but those are pretty much my only complaints and the reasons why I couldn't give this place five stars.
