Things it seems we can all agree on: the service is a little slow. Maybe leaning towards a lot slow. And probably verging on unfriendly (unless you're Friends of Friends. Yay for F-of-F!)

Things I like that we apparently may disagree on: place is non-smoking! Awesome not smelling like cigarettes.

Now, I saw a complaint about this, but I really prefer my fish in fish tacos battered and deep fried. Which is exactly how Cantina prepared theirs. Maybe this is more a Baja-style fish taco, but whatever. It's also more a Jess-style fish taco. Not only is there a fried fish-delish, the taco portion is huge. It's hard to hold everything together. In fact, that would be my one quibble: there's too much food in the taco. But they are also Mexico City type tacos (Mexico City the city), so they won't generally have a tortilla larger than about 4 inches diameter. There's a lot crammed into those inches though.

The guacamole was right on. The salsa had a hint of a flavor that I don't love, and I would rather have the chunkier salsa cruda, but it's still good.

I also thought it was very reasonably priced, but my beliefs may have become skewed by Boston. Luckily, I can get re-aligned over the coming months! Pittsburgh pricing is rad. This place is rad. No smoking is rad. And the low-key winter is rad when compared to how much of a crush eating here can be in nice weather.
