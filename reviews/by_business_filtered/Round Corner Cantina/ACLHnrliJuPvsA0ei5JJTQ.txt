I first discovered Round Corner Cantina because it's the place everyone goes while waiting for a table at Piccolo Forno.  Round Corner has a lot to say for itself in it's own right.  The food is very good and it has a really cool vibe.  I do agree the service is often a little slow.  Not crazy about the smoking on the patio.  But despite these flaws, Round Cantina is a fun place to visit and enjoy with friends.
