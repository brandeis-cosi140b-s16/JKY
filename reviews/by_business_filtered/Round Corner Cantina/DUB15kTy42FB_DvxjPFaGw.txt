Noon on a Saturday is the perfect time to try this place out. It's just getting started for the day, after an assumedly busy Friday night, so getting a table and great service is highly likely. (I hear Sunday brunch is amazing, but I have yet to try it myself.)

Food-wise, I'm a stickler for the fish tacos. The corn tortillas are just right, with a sweet, flaky fish, crunchy cabbage and a creamy aioli to round out the flavor. The portion sizes are spot on - not too big, not too small. The salsa is a spicy roasted concoction. It tastes homemade, and I hope I'm not wrong. The tortilla chips clearly are fresh, but with a bit too much oil for my taste.

The atmosphere has a retro charm to it. It's the kind of place that makes you feel cool just by walking in the door. The bar has an interesting selection of import beers and snazzy cocktails. Grapefruit margarita, anyone?

In the warmer months, grab a seat out back. The open, half covered patio reminds me of a backyard party, especially when it's abuzz with after work happy hour folk, which it usually is. It can get hot in the Pittsburgh sun, so they set out jugs of water and cups as a self-serve rehydration station. I don't know why more places don't do this. It's brilliant.
