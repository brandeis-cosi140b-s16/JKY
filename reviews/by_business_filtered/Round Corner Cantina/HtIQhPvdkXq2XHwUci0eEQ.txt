No service or offer of service for more than 10 minutes. Asked three staff people if it was seat yourself or wait and was told "it's all seat yerself" and sat down. Still no one came to table near bar. Terrible svc. Will not return. Strolled across the street to Piccolo Forno where we were warmly welcomed and seated in two minutes.
