Went to Round Corner Cantina for the first time yesterday for happy hour and half price tacos on Mondays. Happy with the house La Cantina margarita, very fresh tasting. Also a few good beers on tap. The back patio was already pretty busy at 6pm with nice weather, so we sat inside and had great service up at the main bar. Chips were fresh and fantastic, salsa was also very good. We tried the lamb barbacoa and pescado (fried mahi) tacos. The lamb was full of flavor, would definitely have again. Fish tacos were good, fish was fried well and not greasy or soggy. The coleslaw that came on the pescado packed a spicy kick, maybe some fresh jalape√±o hiding in the dressing. Of the two, the lamb was the standout. Excited to go back and try more!
