Visited the Cantina last Friday night and sat outside because it was a beautiful night. I didn't care for my one drink, Dos Esquis beer, cilantro, jalape√±o and salt. The server said it was popular, but not to my taste buds. I did think they had a nice selection of drinks. I had the fish tacos........they were tasty, but not the best I have had. My friend had some chicken and potatoes dish wrapped around corn husks; however after several drinks we weren't aware you don't eat the husks!  It would have been nice for our server to fill us in on this minor detail. The chips and guacamole were excellent and the chips appeared homemade. It is small inside and pretty dark, so I recommend either going for happy hour and/or trying to sit outside.
