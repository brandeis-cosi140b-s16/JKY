The tacos are good and the back patio has a ton of seating. The drinks, which were supposed to be their claim to fame, are good but not great. Most drinks are slightly over priced but it's a cool, clean place and one can expect a price bump.

Worst part about this place are the bartenders. Bad attitudes, are slow, mess up drink orders and ultimately do not belong behind a bar. Seriously.. get some new staff and this place will be worth going back to. Til then there's plenty of better bars on the East side to visit.
