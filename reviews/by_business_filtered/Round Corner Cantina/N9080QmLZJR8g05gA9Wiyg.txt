If you enjoy going to a restaurant to stare at an empty table because nobody is taking your order, then this is the place for you! If you like being spoken down to because your waitress thinks you should "check your math" after giving her a 15 percent tip (after she was rude to you and ignored your table all night), by all means, stop on by!

Seriously, the drinks are ok, but the waitstaff diminishes anything positive about this place with their terrible attitudes. Absolute garbage.
