The back porch is a great scene. Think professionals, hipsters, locals, and grad students eating, drinking, and laughing. Round Corner always has a conversational hum lifted over the flowing libations.

I suggest the Pescado (Mahi) or the Puerco (Pork Belly!!!), both tacos. And get a cerveza AND a sangria. I am a thirsty boy, especially on summer nights.

Good news from my last visit: The server was engaging and cool. So now the waitstaff has been intentionally rude on only 40% of my stops. That is 4 stars despite the waitstaff hating me 40% of the time. That is how much I like the Round Corner. 

Go. Now!
