I can't speak to it's authenticity, but I really like this place! Great for catching a few drinks and some casual food with a friend or two at the bar. There is ample outdoor seating when the weather is nice.

All the fare is just slightly unusual compared to El Campesino or Mad Mex. I love the fresh radishes in the tacos, and for me, corn tortillas are a must have! Lots of vegetarian options too.

Bar service has been inconsistent - I swear I've had bartenders look right through me. . . . they seem to either be very good or very mediocre - not in drink preparation but just in attentiveness. 

One downside - the bar is all hard surfaces, so it gets very loud! This seems a common problem with new restaurants these days. Also, since it serves as the unofficial pre-bar for Piccolo Fiorno across the street, it can get very busy.
