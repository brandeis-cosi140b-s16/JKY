Sure, the outdoor seating is quite pleasant when the climate agrees. Absolutely, the seitan tacos are a great substitution to a carnivore diet (this coming from a near meatatarian). Undoubtedly, their combination of brunch and mexican cuisines is tasty and filling. Remarkably, their salsas/sauces/guac are all fresh, delicious, and worth licking the bowl for the last bits.

But the real reason I'll go back? The booze.

I know what you're thinking - that pseudo-alcoholic from the Midwest is at it again, overlooking what really makes a place great and just going straight for the bottle. But this place is for real. I enjoyed a bloody mary during a Sunday brunch that not only cured a hangover but almost paved the road for the start of a second hangover. My brunch mate slurped down a mojito of sorts that flavorful and strong, much to her delight. Despite the strength of said potions, they were still quite tasty. My only complaint is that I couldn't slog mine down fast enough to enjoy it ice cold in its entirety. I have also enjoyed some sort of spicy martini, another non-spicy martini, and something involving fruit and tequila - while I apologize for not remembering the specifics (see: sentence #1 of this paragraph), I will assure you that everything was enjoyable and strong enough to make a bull lose balance.

The only complaint I have about this place is that it seems slightly overpriced. I know it is the only decent place of its kind in the area, but their prices signify that they also know it and are using it to their advantage. Also, the vibe can border on the pretentious depending on the crowd, but I would say in general from my visits and peer-ins from the street that the crowd isn't much of a worry. 

Overall, and this kind of goes without saying, I'll be back. What can I say - some of us love the sauce, whichever variety it may be.
