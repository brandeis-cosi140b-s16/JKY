Disappointing.  With chains like Mad Mex and Patron in Shadyside, I thought this independent small business would easily beat their competition.  Unfortunately, there is BIG room for improvement in regards to portion size, taste, and customer service.  I hate to give anyone under 3 stars, but when you have to wait like 7 minutes for a waitress from the time you sat yourself, 15 minutes for drinks and mediocre salsa, I just felt obligated to be honest.  5 stars -1 customer service -1 food was meh -1 for $10 shots of tequila that cost $20 for the whole bottle = 2 stars
