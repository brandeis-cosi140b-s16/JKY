Will not go back. Poor service. Don't split checks. Mediocre food. Small, cramped tables. This place is snobby and unwelcoming. The outside tables are nice but rarely open. And don't try to bring a big group. Everyone will get served at different times and the check can only be split three ways regardless of the number of people in your party.
