New ownership of a bar that's been there for a long time.  New decor inside, same huge, great yard out back.  This place has an adventurous drink menu including standards like the Pimm's Cup as well as several margaritas with unconventional ingredients such as basil, pepper, chartreuse, hibiscus, elderflower... Charming ambience - drinks served in Mason jars, homey, hip feeling to the patio.  They are still working out a few details, including the offerings on a limited food menu, but are off to a good start.  Also worth noting is the fact that while their stated hours included a closing time of 10:00 on Sunday, they were open longer than that since many people were there.
