The atmosphere of this place is like no other. I love going around the time that the sun is about to set. It's got a great location and when you walk in, a maze-like hall will take you to a surprise patio in the back. It's great.

So why 3 stars for a great place? 2 reasons...

1. Service everytime I go is slllllllow!
2. We happened to go on a Friday night last week. As we stood in the patio area waiting on a table, I noticed it got to be a competion of who would rush to a table first. We has 2 groups steal tables from us. It really cuts down the mood a bit when you have to race to a table. Fix? Go during non busy hours?
