One drunken night in Pittsburgh, me and some friends stopped by Round Corner Cantina, and I'm happy we did.  

As for the service: It was alright, as our waitress seemed to be around enough but the back-server was a bit rude.

As for the food: It was delicious, everything I wanted when drunkenly eating tacos and drinking margaritas.  The chips and guacamole were splendid.  We also ordered the tacos camarones, carnitas, and pescados.  They were great portions and were super tasty.
