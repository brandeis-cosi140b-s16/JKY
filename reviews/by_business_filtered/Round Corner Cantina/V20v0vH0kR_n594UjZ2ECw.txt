We've been here three times and the service is terrible. The food is good, no doubt about that, but their servers will take their time to take your order, bring you drinks and if you want refills...well, just forget about that!
Food is well priced and very tasty, drinks are expensive, backyard is pretty. So, it's a great place to hang out with friends, just don't go hungry and bring your own bottle of water. No kidding.
