Saturday night was my first time at the Cantina.

I must say, when I first walked through the front door I was very confused to the identity of this restaurant/bar.  As I walked through the dining room and stepped onto the back patio I quickly realized the vibe they are going for.  The atmosphere was great, it felt like a backyard BBQ! The place was so chill and laid back. I appreciated the decor and the lighting.  It was perfect.

We were immediately greeted by a waitress and ordered a round of drinks.  She recommended me a margarita, the El Rey. It wasn't the best I've ever had but it was strong and that's how margaritas should be. We also ordered chips and guacamole for the group and we all ordered tacos.  Brisket was my taco of choice and it was good. 

We had a great evening talking and enjoying our drinks and food.  It was a great little place and I would go back.  Perfect place to sit and visit with friends.

5 stars- for atmosphere
3 stars- for food
4 stars- for drinks
4 stars- for service

Will recommend to my friends visiting the Lawrenceville area!!

Also, after reading some other reviews I'd like to add that I was here with my 65 year old father, 59 year old mother, and 24 year old brother. We were treated like every other table and had excellent service. EVERYONE enjoyed themselves!
