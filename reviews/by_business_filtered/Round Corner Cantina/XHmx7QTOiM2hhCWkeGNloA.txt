This place epitomizes what Lawrenceville has become: a place of high quality product, but of crappy disposition. Let me qualify that statement by saying that the food is fantastic - really, the best Mexican-style restaurant in the city of Pittsburgh and an even better bar for cocktails. The people making their food and beverages know what they're doing, and the atmosphere is top-notch. But the service is rude and unwelcoming. Each and every time I have visited, I have felt like an inconvenience in the server's day. The most recent time I visited was on a Tuesday evening. I arrived late in the evening, with friends, and when "closing time" came around midnight, a server yelled onto the patio that customers needed to "finish their drinks and get out". I have never, ever, felt so unappreciated as a customer in a restaurant setting. Though the food and drink are spectacular, they are not worth enduring the self-entitled, hipster attitude that comes along for the ride.
