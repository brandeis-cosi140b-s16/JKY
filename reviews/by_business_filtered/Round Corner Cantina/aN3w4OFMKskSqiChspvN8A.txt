"Margaritas in mason jars!" We planned a happy hour here a while back and all I could declare for the week leading up to the happy hour was, "margaritas in mason jars!" Seriously, kids, I find this to be a delightful thing.

We all ordered tacos of variously cooked parts of cows and pigs - chorizo, carnitas, beef birria. All reported satisfied with their meals.

Now the main draw of Round Corner Cantina is the back patio. It's very popular and for good reason. Although it can get pretty hot and I wish they had more fans running, there's just something relaxing and fun about sitting outside on a nice summer day with a margarita in a mason jar. So much so that friends from the suburbs drove in to the (big, bad) city for happy hour. I didn't think suburbanites did that in Pgh but they will for Cantina.  That's enough of a testament to this place for me.
