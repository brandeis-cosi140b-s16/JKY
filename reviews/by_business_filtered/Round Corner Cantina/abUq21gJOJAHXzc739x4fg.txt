Excellent Mexican food with great atmosphere.

I've been to Round Corner on three occasions and I enjoyed it each time. The decorations are amazing, complete with macabre touches. The outdoor area (not open during the winter) feels like the set of a movie. In addition to the atmosphere, the food was great. I've had the tamales, the guac, and the potato rolled tacos. All were stellar. The dark haired bar tender is very nice and poured all of my drinks generously. I found the price to be reasonable for the quality of food I was getting.

As stated in other reviews, they have removed the tamales from the menu. This was really disappointing but forced me to try some other great dishes here. I recommend coming here for the drinks, the food, and the hip atmosphere.
