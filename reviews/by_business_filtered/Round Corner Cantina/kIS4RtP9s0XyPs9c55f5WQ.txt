Love love love this place. Yummy chips and salsa, yummy margs at decent prices and yummy food! I also loved the décor and feel of the bar and am excited to try out the balcony in the summer time. I had the chille relleno which was really yummy but I wasn't expecting it to be deep fried. I think it would have been better just baked (that's how I had it in Mexico at least) I don't know maybe everyone else eats them deep fried. Anyway, don't get me wrong-it was good. The rest of the group had various versions of the tacos and were all pleased with them. The chips and salsa were delicious and the beer/margarita cocktails were superb! 

We will be back here again when we need our marg/Mexican food fix.

Pros:
Chips and Salsa (have I said how much I like them here yet?)
Drinks
Décor

Cons:
Space is kinda small-get there early if you want a table
