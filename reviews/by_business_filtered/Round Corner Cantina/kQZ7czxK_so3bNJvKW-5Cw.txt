My husband and I stopped in on a Sunday night. We were on a quick 2 day trip to Pittsburgh and this was our first meal. A great introduction to a couple days filled with delicious food. 
We each ordered a cocktail - both were good but not blow you away amazing. I had the Del Ray margarita and I really enjoyed cracking the dried pepper and adding the seeds for some heat.
The food was amazing. Granted we had meandered into a small hipster bike benefit at the Franktuary prior and were well buzzed by the time dinner came but we ordered large and ate it all. Quest dip starter, 2 orders of the corn (by far the best Mexican street style corn I've had), and 2 orders of tacos - the pork belly and the tofu. All were fantastic. 
The bartender was super friendly and the vibe was chill. If we were local you would find us on the patio on the regs!
