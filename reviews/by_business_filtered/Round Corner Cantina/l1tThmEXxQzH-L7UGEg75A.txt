Mixed bag myths busted: After reading about how rude the service was and that people are out for blood when it comes to getting a seat and   despite the fabulous food many declared never to return, my boyfriend and I  headed out to the Cantina.  
It was a perfect night for the patio and after almost heading back in to get seats, the good seat/parking spot fairy sprinkled a little dust and TA-DA seats.  We ordered drinks (me tea, him beer) and chips&salsa.  Our server seemed annoyed like she was going to live up to the "rude" label that so many had attached the to service.  She turned out to be very kind and paid the right amount f attention to us.  Refills, beers general check ins are came in a timely manner.  I had the seitan tacos-very fresh, would have liked a little spice and will alter my order next time.  My boyfriend had the quesadilla de la parrilla and thought he was going to implode he enjoyed it so much.  Our server (again bustin' up the myths) informed us the quesadilla takes a bit longer to cook but that the wait was well worth it.)  
Overall had a great night and would return again....in a heartbeat.  I can see the place getting negative reactions as yes it does get crowded, yes people smoke outside and yes the servers are busy and will not going hold your hand all night and/or stop and chat you up.  But it is a bar for goodness sakes!   Keep that in mind, don't take yourself too seriously and you will enjoy your night....
