Yay, finally - rooftop (sort of) seating and good food!

I have been to Round Corner twice now and I love it. The first thing that won me over was the authenticity of their tacos. No lettuce, shredded cheddar cheese, ground beef, or other Americanized fillings here. Radishes, housemade salsas, cilantro, and all of the other ingredients you'd actually find in authentic Mexican-style tacos. And boy, are they good!

I have tried the tacos de carne (hanger steak) and the tacos de puerco (pork belly). They were both great, but the puerco was definitely the better of the two. The apple salsa and the poblano made it just spot-on delicious! I've also tried the chips with salsa and their guacamole. I would recommend the guac over the salsa. The salsa wasn't bad, but it was sort of average. The guac was nice and creamy with bits of cilantro (I love cilantro).

On to the alcohol: the selection is small and Mexican, which is fine with me because I love my Tecate and Dos Equis Amber (small and Mexican - NO PUN INTENDED hehe). 

One of the things I love about this place is the price is right. Two tacos, a 24-ounce Tecate, and chips & guacamole would run you about $18 - not bad at all.
