I've been alive and living in Pittsburgh for too long to just be finding out about La Cantina now. But isn't that how it always is with a great spot you feel you've been missing out on?
A Saturday night where the weather is warm and the night sky clear is best spent on the Cantina's back patio. It's gushing with life. The drinks are excellent (I like when I can find a real margarita that's not some artificial "ultimate margarita" that always seems to disappoint. They have a great selection of tasty tacos too. You might think it strange to find a spot that makes you feel this close to actually being in Mexico, but you'll be having too good a time to care!
