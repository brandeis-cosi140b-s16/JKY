A five star restaurant for me is a place firing on all cylinders, with great food and flawless friendly service. Each star down usually involves some sacrifice in these areas, with one star being bad at both. This is the first time I'm writing a review that is one star entirely because of service, because the food itself isn't bad. But the service was awful to the point that it is worth my time to warn people away after my experience there this event. I went in with a few friends for some drinks and snacks at the bar. I'm not sure what his problem was but the bartender was a complete jerk. Service was slow for us food wise and that normally isn't an issue but someone tending bar should be friendly and accommodating not snappy and rude for no reason. We weren't the only ones with an issue, as the bartender decided to yell across the restaurant at another party, making rude remarks about a patron and ordering her to leave. It was like being transported into the soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld and completely shocked us. This place must be doing great if they can afford to have an employee ordering clearly sober and not disorderly customers to leave and put off other customers in the process. It's rare to see a place throw money away like that but after seeing how that lady was treated and after the attitude my group got, they won't be having me back even if their food isn't bad. I can cook at home, I go out to eat for the experience and the service, and Cantina proved that they don't need customers or don't want them, I'm not sure which. I won't be recommending then to anyone now, and after putting on this type of display, I doubt I'm the only person who was put off.
