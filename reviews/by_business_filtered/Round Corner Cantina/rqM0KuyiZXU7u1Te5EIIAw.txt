I have a soft spot in my heart for Cantina. I like the ambiance, I like the drinks, I like the servers and I LOVE those fucking pickles. That being said, after eating pretty much all of the menu, I am a bit bored and the prices are regularly a bit high for my waning interest. Monday is half price night and that is when you need to go. Eat the fish tacos, the pickles and maybe have some drinks. Bring your hot date and show off, makeout in the backyard under the stars. That's what I would do.
