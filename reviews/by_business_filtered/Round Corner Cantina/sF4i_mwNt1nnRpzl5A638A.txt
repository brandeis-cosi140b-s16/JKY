This place is much, much bigger than it looks! In the summer they have the back patio open and it's truly an awesome summer atmosphere. It's like being at a huge party in someone's back yard.

Their tacos will blow your mind. I don't handle spicy food well, but the tacos I had here were WELL worth it! You can taste the cilantro, which happens to be one of my favorites.

Their karaoke night is a fun mix of people -- you never know what song will come up next.
