I've been wanting to come here for a long time, and I got my wish last Thursday.  They have a pretty good happy hour from 5 to 7, and one all day drink special during the week. Nearly all of the drinks have some kind of fresh fruit or herbs in them, and they are delicious and different. Drinks are also about half the price that you'd pay elsewhere.

What I really came for, though, was the food.  I'd heard it was tasty, inventive, sort-of-authentic Mexican food.  I loved it!  I ordered the Patatas Gratinadas, a dish made with sweet potatoes, lots of cheese, and chipotle, served piping hot.  I also tried (devoured, actually) a friend's Frijoles con Queso, a cheesy bean dip.  They also make their own yummy tortilla chips.  What really struck me, though, was that they charged dive bar prices for great food!

The decor was great and the service was friendly. It got really crowded towards the end of our visit, with a wide variety of customers. I can't wait to go back, sit on the (soon to be heated) patio, and try more drinks and menu items.  For a list of their menu and other information, go to their Facebook page.
