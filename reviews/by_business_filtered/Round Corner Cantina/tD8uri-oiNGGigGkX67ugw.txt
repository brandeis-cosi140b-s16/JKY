I don't even like seitan, or tacos really, but I sometimes find myself craving Round Corner's seitan tacos. Ample cilantro and lime make them super tasty and radish adds nice color and crunch. I love the double tortilla method which keeps the experience pretty neat-- I usually avoid tacos because they get messy, but these are manageable. The salsas that I have tried in the past have been terrible though, so the kitchen is a one trick pony when it comes to vegan options. The bartenders make great Pimms' cups (with cucumber!) and I really like the Carnation cocktail. The atmosphere of the bar is cool, the music is usually interesting and the back patio is to die for. Seriously, getting a table on the patio can be cut-throat, as seating is first come first serve (or a competition of attention and aggression) and is not managed by staff. I find the situation to be stressful. You usually have to sit down before the servers even clear/clean the table (which makes me feel like an asshole), otherwise you'll lose it. It's kind of like a showdown in the wild west, sometimes resulting in a draw (two parties claim a table at the same time and a new sort of standoff begins). I think I could muster up a fourth star should they get a host to keep seating organized and clean on busy nights. Other than structural problems with service, I've had no real problems with the wait-staff.
