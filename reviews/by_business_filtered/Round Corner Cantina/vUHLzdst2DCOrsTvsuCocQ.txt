Round corner cantina is tough to rate.  If you're coming to have a beer and some chips and salsa at the bar it's totally decent.  Not great, but not bad at all.  The waiters service and lines at the bar tends to be fairly slow, and you go inside, the food and drinks are fine, but to my tongue, nothing particularly special.  

The real reason to go is the outdoor Patio.  If you're going to get margaritas and cold Mexican beers on a hot summer night in their outdoor courtyard, it's PERFECT.  Not too loud, it's easy to have conversations with friends and it's a very pleasant atmosphere with plenty of seating. So if you come for drinks with friends in their patio to get the most out of your round corner experience.
