It is dark in here. Like really REALLY dark! Like you could make out in the corner and no one would really notice dark. Let's not be silly though, I didn't make up in there, I come to eat! 

I really do enjoy this place, even if I have to feel around for the taco's on my plate because I can't see them. But this just makes me sound old. So on to the good part, the food! So good! I had the mahi mahi taco's and the pork taco's and they are exceptional! I love when they put cabbage in a taco, I know that sounds weird, but it's just so tasty with the marinade they use! 

I know that Chi Chi's (RIP) trained me to expect free chips and salsa, so it's always nice to have them free. Sorry to burst the bubble, but they're four bucks a pop....BUT it is an endless basket. Which is good because it usually disappears in about 5.5 seconds. I'm also a big judge of salsa, and this salsa definitely passes the test, with just the right amount of kick! 

I do LOVE the outside area! There's tons of seating and benches and it's just so great to sit out there on a nice warm summer night with a tall glass of Dos Equis! And I am SO into tequila...badly into it. So watch out, because that bill can get high when that's in the mix! You can also trip down the steps in the dark as night dining room after too many....
