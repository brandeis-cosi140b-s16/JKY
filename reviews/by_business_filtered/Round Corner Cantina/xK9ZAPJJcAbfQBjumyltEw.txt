I was excited when this placed opened, deterred by the initial crappy staff, then they got better people and better tasting food. Now, most of the people working there seem decent. That being said, five times in a row I've woken up the next day with insane diarrhea from the tacos. I'm talking volcanic liquid fire, the type that leveled Pompeii, pouring from my butt. It doesn't even make sense how much comes out compared to what I actually consumed.

DO NOT EAT THE TACOS.

Do not eat anything there just to be safe.

At first  and second I thought it was just me then I thought it was the maragarita mix, so I avoided that to no avail. Then another half-off taco monday rolled around and my friends coaxed me back, but Tuesday I was late for work from the round corner cantina anal destruction. Then a friend said the seitan tacos gave her the same thing. So I only ordered the tofu tacos next time (several months later). That was last night. I woke up at 7:30a today and haven't left my bedroom/bathroom trail for 3 hours. NEVER AGAIN. (I've said this before.)

My suggestions include to Cantina:
1) give Imodium with the tacos (maybe sprinkle it on top crumbled like queso fresco)
2) market the tacos as a 12 hour weight loss program
3) include diarrhea warnings on the menu next to the tofu and seitan tacos 
  (I've never had the others, but my friend said the chicken does the same thing to her)

This is my own fault for going back, giving into peer pressure like an after school special, and wanting tacos but being too lazy to go somewhere else or just make them.
