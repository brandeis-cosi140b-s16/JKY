One of the few places in Pittsburgh with authentic latino drinks! For that crowded from wall-to-wall experience, hit them up on a weekend night. I enjoyed the tacos by day, and the fact that they actually make REAL caiprinha's here, even when it's snowing outside. Now that's an oxymoron that I love: caiprinha's in the snow..... Only in Pittsburgh!
