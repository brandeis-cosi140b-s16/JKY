This place gets some serious points for just looking cool.  It looks like a restaurant where you would hire Danny Trejo to assassinate somebody.  When you walk in, it's so dark you can only see silhouettes of people at the bar.  For full effect, they should add a record scratching to a stop every time the door opens.  In fact, I've just trademarked that idea.  Once your eyes adjust, this place is actually pretty damn cozy.  You'll enter into the main bar, which has plenty of space.  Most of the mixed drinks are great, but the beer selection is...well, I just hope you like Dos Equis.  The back dining area is pretty comfortable, and they usually play one of those crazy Luchador action hero movies on the screen.  

The menu is taco based (with a few exceptions) and I am okay with that.  Everything is functionally pretty decent.  There's nothing necessarily that I go home and crave, but I think the overall vibe of the place goes a long way toward correcting this.  In the warmer months, they have a back patio that effectively doubles the size of the restaurant, which is also decorated perfectly to the theme.

The only drawback is that each time I've been here, the waitstaff seems a bit overwhelmed with the crowds.  Oh, and the cement benches in the back are so low that you will see no less than four hipster ass cracks.  It's alright to throw pennies at them though.  Legend tells that if you land a penny betwixt those scrawny cheeks, you win 1,000 free tacos.

I might have made some of that up though.
