Round Corner Cantina is a cool and hip place. Definitely another one of those places in Pittsburgh that makes me feel like I'm in the East Village or Williamsburg or somewhere else in downtown Manhattan or in Brooklyn. The outdoor patio (I'd call it a beer garden) is fantastic and for me is the big drawcard for this place. 

The food we tried was very tasty (we enjoyed some tacos and a quesadilla). Some other reviewers have been less positive about the food but I can honestly say that the tacos were some of the tastiest I've eaten outside of Mexico. 

The drinks are another story altogether. Perhaps we were unlucky, but the two margaritas we each ordered were just not hitting the mark--they apparently used good tequila but things were a bit "rough" to me. Definitely way better than a sugary "margarita" you'd get at a cheesy American Tex-Mex place, but not perfect. In future I'm going to stick to beer. Which is fine, because knocking back some cold beers and tasty tacos in the festively lit outdoor patio on a warm evening is exactly what this place is for.

(Final note: yes this place seems to attract the growing group of Pittsburgh hipsters, or "Pittsters" as I prefer to call them. I'm not saying that's bad, just giving you a heads up in case you think that is worth knowing.)
