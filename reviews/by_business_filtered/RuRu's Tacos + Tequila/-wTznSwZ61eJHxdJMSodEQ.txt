This was a spur of the moment lunch as my boyfriend and I just happened to be driving by, but what a great experience it was! The patio was amazing, sunny and comfortable. They had a great selection of brunch drinks and the food was delicious! I loved my tacos I got "fat guy in a little coat" and "I'll have what she's having" and my boyfriend got a chicken and white bean burrito which unfortunately I cannot remember the name of. The service was a tad slow but they seemed to be busy only on the patio which I'm sure was overwhelming. We will definitely be back as soon as possible.
