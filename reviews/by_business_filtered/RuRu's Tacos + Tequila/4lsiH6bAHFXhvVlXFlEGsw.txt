"Disappointed. Not as good as I had hoped."
Met friends for drinks and dinner. The positive: the frozen strawberry margarita was delicious!!! They have one night during the week where margaritas are $5. Had the cheese dip which was not good. Not sure how you can mess up cheese dip but they did somehow. They do have a nice patio area. We decided to go elsewhere for dinner.
