This place is so cute. It's in a great neighbor hood and the outside patio with its own bar is awesome.  We came in and got one of the community tables by the bar so we could watch the game.  

I got the Feeling good Louis and the whatever the shrimp one was.  So crispy chicken and the shrimp.  Both were great.  My boyfriend had the it was the Dukes and the ill have what she's having.  We both didn't care for the Dukes because it was too crispy.  

Also had the wings as an app and they were pretty good. Service is decent.  Came at 6pm and the place was starting to fill up.  May need a reservation if coming later.  

Def will come here on a nice sunny day to sit outside.
