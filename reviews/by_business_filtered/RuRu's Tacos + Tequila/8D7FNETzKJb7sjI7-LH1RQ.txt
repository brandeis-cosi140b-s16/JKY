Pretty good food, but crappy service.  This was our first time here, so we ordered waters with a few food items to test the waters...  The bartender took our order and we never saw him again.  We couldn't even order any cocktails or more food, which is a shame because it was really tasty.  We had to suck on ice cubes to soothe or tonnes from the spicy food.  Not a good first impression for a new restaurant.
