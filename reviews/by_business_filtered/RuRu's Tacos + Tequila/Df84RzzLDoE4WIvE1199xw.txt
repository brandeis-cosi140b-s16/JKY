First time tonight.  Loved it. Good food. Had the trio dip combo with the chips. The salsa bowl was delicious as were the other two dips which were. Avocado and quesa. Good service. Nice burrito and salads. Patio is great looking , fire coming out of the pedestals was a very classy touch.  Great outdoor furniture. We ate inside. Comfortable booth, well padded. And booth area was more quiet than the bar area which was very noisy. Awesome restrooms, great decor  good service. Great parking.  Should be a big hit. Is a little expensive compared to some simple Mexican places,  they also charged $5 for a salsa refill. Which is free at most Mex places.
