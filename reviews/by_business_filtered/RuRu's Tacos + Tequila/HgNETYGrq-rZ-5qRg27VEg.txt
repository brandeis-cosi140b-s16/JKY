Everything was amazing except bar service. Our dining experience was most definitely 5 stars. Server was quick, super nice and our food came out excellent. Afterwards, we wanted to go grab a drink outside but it was too busy so we opted to sit at the indoor bar which was nice. However, after asking to have the channel changed to something other than golf... The bartender had to be asked twice...then he had to go ask the manager...and 30 minutes later the channel never was changed. Needless to say, we finished our drink and got the bill. This is only frustrating because 1) no one else was watching the tv 2) we were really enjoying our time but felt that we were more of an annoyance than appreciated customers. This would have been a 3 star if the food service wasn't as amazing as it was.
