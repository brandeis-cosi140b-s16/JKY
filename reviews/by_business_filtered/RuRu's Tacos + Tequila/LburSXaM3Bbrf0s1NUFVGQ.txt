I want to preface this review with stating that I'm in the service industry so I like to think that I'm understanding to some of the little weird quirks of certain servers and bartenders. RuRu's has pretty decent food and amazing cocktails, so it stinks that my rating couldn't be higher, but the little blonde bartender tonight was something else. First of all we came in at 10pm, and the posted closing time is 11pm, and received huffs and puffs and eye rolls all the way to the kitchen where she  checked if we could still order food. Every item I tried to order on the menu that was smacked down in front of me, she then told me was the wrong choice and poked fun at. I asked for a to-go cup for my Diet Coke and then she charged me for 2 drinks, which is plain stupid. Lastly a friend and I just simply wanted to split our $15 dip appetizer and were told that it would be too hard for her to split the item. You're using MICROS, the same computer system 90% of the Charlotte dining scene uses, it is VERY possible and VERY easy to do. Moral of the story, homegirl just wanted to boost the price of our bill to receive a larger tip. I get it. It was a slow night. Little did she know that I make a living off bartending and tip minimum 40% short of the server cussing me out. In this case I actually left MORE than that, but I just want management to know (if you're reading this) that your food is only as good as the hands serving it!!
