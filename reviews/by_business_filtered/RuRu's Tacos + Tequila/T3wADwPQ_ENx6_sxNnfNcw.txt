I hate to make one of my first Yelp reviews one with so few positive comments.  But I must say I am very disappointed in my RuRu experience.  I came alone on a Saturday afternoon and service was terribly slow and almost nonexistent.  The food can only be described as mediocre at best.  The queso was the best thing I had and it left much to be desired. I also had the crispy chicken tacos and the Korean steak taco. Both were bland  and the steak was tough.  

I will continue to visit Bakersfield for my taco and tequila fix.
