I recently visited RuRus with my fianc√© and I have to say i was disappointed. The good: the queso royale is seriously delicious! Hands down best queso I have ever had. The crispy chicken taco is also very tasty and reminds me of bang bang shrimp with the chipotle sauce. And the bad: the steak taco was very chewy, I ended up having to take half the steak off the taco because it was too tough to eat. The pork carnitas taco was extremely sweet and dry. I ended up sending this back to be replaced with the crispy chicken taco. The mahi mahi was VERY fishy tasting. Not sure if it was old or what but took one bite and sent it back. 

The staff was very friendly and apologetic for the issues with the food and the were more than happy to replace the tacos we didn't like with another. Not sure if I visited on an off day or what but it seems like their menu has some kinks to work out.
