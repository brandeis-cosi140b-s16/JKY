I've eaten here a few times now while visiting Charlotte from Durham. A native Texan, I have high standards for Mexican food. But here goes. 

The trio of dips is really, really good. Solid salsa and guacamole, good queso. I thought 15 bucks was a little steep for an appetizer initially, but once I saw the portions...they are massive. I'd recommend sharing this with at least 4 other people so as not to ruin your appetite. They restock the chips for you at no charge (what I used to think was a given but have sadly learned is not the case everywhere.)

The entree I typically get is the vegetarian tofu taco plate. It's really great they have such a good vegetarian option, and many others, too. I thought the tacos were pretty good. They didn't blow my mind, though. 

Service was prompt and friendly. Vibe is very cool/hip/young. In fact, vibe is what kicked my review up from otherwise a three...to a four stars. 

Overall I'd recommend this more as a place to grab a drink and an appetizer after work than as a place to eat dinner. Nonetheless, it's solid overall and I'll probably be back.
