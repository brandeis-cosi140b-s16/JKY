Atmosphere?  First time I've been to this part of "The Villa" since it was Uncle Milt's, and I have to say I think it's a shame no other restaurants have tried to make it work here since then (at least none that I can remember) as the space is awesome.  Easily the best ambiance of any of the "taco & tequila" places that seem to be everywhere in Charlotte lately.

Food & drink?  I started with their take on the Moscow Mule.  It had a rosemary syrup and sprig in it and was... okay.   Also payed for the free-in-most-places-like-this Chips & Salsa.  Worth the charge?  Not so much - chips were average at best, and the salsa tasted like it came from a jar.  Bummer, as that's usually my barometer for a place like this.  Oh well, on to the next course.  Had the Korean skirt steak taco, the Fried Oyster taco and a side of spicy slaw.  KB taco was pretty tasty.  Oyster taco had too much wasabi crema on it, but was otherwise okay.  Slaw was average.  My wife had the grilled Mahi taco and a side of organic jasmine brown rice.  She remarked that the taco hardly had any fish in it, and her side of rice "angered" her it was so bad.  She ate my slaw.  Kid had a Mexican soda and the cheese quesadilla (recco'd for kids).  We took a bite, and thought it was basic but serviceable.

Service?  Waiter was quite overwhelmed by the busy-ness of the evening - I asked to hear the RuRu's story, but he cut me off.  Barely saw him again until it was time to pay.  Fortunately he wasn't the one responsible for the delivery of the food or drinks - everything came on time.  Chips were even refreshed without asking.  

If only I had liked them enough to want more...
