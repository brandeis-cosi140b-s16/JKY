How is this place only 3 stars?  Last night was definitely a five star experience all the way.

There's ample parking behind the restaurant, which takes a bit to find but it's there.  The patio is easily one of the best in Myers Par with it's tree covered canopy, outdoor bar, firepits and yard lights.  This is easily a place you could spend a few hours having drinks and enjoying the weather. 

Monday-Wednesday have drink specials so I had some strawberry and mint margarita.  It was delicious, just strong enough and only $5!!!  What????

The queso and chips were on point and so were the tacos.  Sure, some won't like that the names of the tacos are taken from movie quotes but who cares.  The Stage 5 Clinger, Looking Good Louis, I'll Have What She's Having, and the Long Duk Dong were incredible. I recommend getting a bunch and sharing as we did.    

Best of all, it wasn't a budget buster.  I've been places, paid a lot more and regretted my meal. This is one I definitely plan to frequent this summer, especially out on the patio.
