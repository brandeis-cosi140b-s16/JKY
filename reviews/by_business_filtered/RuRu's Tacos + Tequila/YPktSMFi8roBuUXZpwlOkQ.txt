Delicious. We went here on a double date and all 4 of us loved everything we had. Everything was fresh and flavorful. Two of us had tacos, the Mahi Mahi, grilled chicken, steak and pork. Two of us had fajitas.   We loved it all!

We had guacamole as an appetizer. The serving was small, that was definitely a negative. Also our waitress although very sweet was not knowledgable when we asked questions. 

Great tequila selection! They had all of our favorites. 

They don't take reservations. We went at 8:30 and waited about 20 minutes at the bar. 

We hope to go back soon.
