Overall a terribly bad and disappointing experience. We came for lunch on a Friday afternoon and though the place was almost empty, the service was poor and slow and we barely made it back to work on time. We started with chips and queso, the chips were stale and the queso was bland. We had a total of 5 tacos between the two of us and we thought the steak taco was the best while the rest were not anything impressive. The mahi mahi was way over cooked and the tortillas seemed microwaved and like something from the grocery store. The lettuce on the tacos was soggy and seemed either old or also microwaved for some reason, regardless it was not fresh.

The one star for this place is really only for the ambiance on the patio, though some of the plants looked a little rough and the inside didn't seem particularly clean. Save your money and go to Cantina 1511 down the road for better food and service, plus complimentary chips and salsa.
