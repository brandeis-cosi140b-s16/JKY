Much better experience this go round. Bartender was attentive yet not hovering to much. I had one of their salads with chicken and it was good. We also had the Three Amigos appetizer-guac, salsa, cheese dip with chips. Pretty good although I wish one of them had some heat. Friend had a chicken rice bowl and said it was really good. Beers specials--$2.75 for certain bottled beer. Will return and try their tacos next time. Also seemed to have a decent selection of beers on tap (not really a beer drinker personally) and I noted a nice selection of tequila.
