I am completely RuRu's obsessed. No shame. 

My favorite part about RuRu's is the amazing atmosphere. We sat on the patio a few weeks ago and it was so delightful- beautifully done. It is so unlike anywhere else that I have ever been in Charlotte. The service can be a little slow at times, but I actually prefer that over pushy waiters/waitresses. Both the guacamole and queso are delicious here- even the salsa is extra good!

I have tried every salad that they offer and they are all delicious and unique. I did not enjoy the burrito bowls as much- I would definitely not order one again. The tacos are also excellent, but very small. RuRu's also has great drinks- I LOVE that they serve frozen margaritas. Ask for the Mango, I promise you won't regret it!! 

If you can't decide about whether or not to try RuRu's, I would definitely say give it a chance. I had very positive experiences here and can't wait for more long dinners on the patio during the summer!
