We've only been twice (1x dining in, 1x take out)

I discovered this place via a yelp friend check-in... the creative names and pics had my attention!!!!

We drove up from Columbia specifically to eat here and were not disappointed.

We parked off providence and were a tad but confused on how to get in to the restaurant.
Once we found our way, we decided to sit outside... it was super busy on a Saturday and only one table was open (and clean) so we sat in the BLARING HOT sun... as soon as another table with an umbrella was cleared we moved!!!
Only downside - there was a wasp burrowing in the wooden bench were we sitting on (paranoia for me)!

We ordered the trio app (loved every single bit of it) and 6 tacos (see pics).
I was a fan of the uncle buck - I'd never had an oyster taco before and RuRu's did it right!
My bf enjoyed all of his choices - I also ordered the fish and tofu tacos and neither were life changing for me.
My son got a plain cheese quesadilla and enjoyed it as well.

We returned a few months later to get to-go (I only ordered the uncle buck) - I tried to order an authentic Mexican soda (I saw them on their menu via yelp), but the bartender said they only carried Mexican coke. Boo!
We also parked in the back this time and entered through the patio.

Overall good experience both times - I'd recommend this joint if you like trying creative tacos!!
