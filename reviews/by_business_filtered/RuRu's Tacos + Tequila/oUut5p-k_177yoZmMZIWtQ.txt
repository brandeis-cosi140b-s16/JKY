If you read my reviews you already know I'm a fan of all things Mexican. Well RuRu's fit perfectly into my obsession. 

I'd visited once before for a Yelp event and instantly became a fan of their patio and live music (that guy is awesome!). This visit was no different, I enjoyed everything! 

My friend and I stared with the Billy Ray Valentine. Nikki is absolutely right, it's queso on steroids! Trust me...if you're already a fan of the cheesy goodness, this takes it up a notch by adding chorizo, corn relish and some pico. Delish!!  I tried to get a picture, but my friend and I were finished it too fast.

I ordered two tacos:

Fat Guy in a Little Coat which is their version of a skirt steak taco with avocado aioli and queso topped with cilantro and lettuce. It was very good. The char on the steak was just right and the avocado aioli was a nice touch. 

Looking Good Louis which is their shrimp taco with chipotle aioli, lettuce and pico. The shrimp were seasoned nicely and had just the right amount of spice on them. I was a huge fan of the chipotle aioli. Yum. 

Our waitress was fun and we just had an overall good time. I will say it can get a bit loud inside once the music starts but just find you way to the patio and you'll be just fine.
