Ruru's has great Mexican food, good customer service, and a tucked away intimate location. I was very impressed with our server, Rico, and their guacamole is out of this world! I got so full on guacamole that I ordered the small "Bend and Snap" salad and was completely satisfied. 

Ruru's supports Charlotte's local breweries and, much to my delight, serves Birdsong's Jalapeno Pale Ale which pairs masterfully with Mexican food! 

The only down side of Ruru's is that they're kind of hard to find. I was able to snag a parking spot in the front lot, but quite honestly don't have a clue how to find the secret back parking lot. I'll worry about that on another day!

Ruru's also has a fabulous patio, but it was 1,000+ degrees last night so we didn't get to sit outside. I vow to return in cooler weather to find the secret back parking lot and enjoy patio dining. 

Ruru's is quite a little gem nestled discretely in Myers Park!
