This little Mexican eatery is tucked away in a strip mall.  I only stumbled upon it by having to go to Albertsons.

I wasn't terribly hungry but I can never pass up a taco joint.  The interior was decorated nice and authentic.  They even had futbol playing on a TV which several of the patrons (including myself) were excited about.  I opted for one taco, the Carne Asada Supreme Soft Taco.  The meat was perfectly seasoned and juicy.  Loaded with cheese, lettuce, tomato and sour cream.  I topped this bad boy with their homemade hot sauce which was muy bien!  I washed it all down with an ice cold lime Jarritos on the front patio.

Was definitely a good choice to stop in.  I may be back tomorrow for a burrito!
