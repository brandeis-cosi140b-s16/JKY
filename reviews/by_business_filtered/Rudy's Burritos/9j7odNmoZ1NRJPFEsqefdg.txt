Was told about this place by a friend.  That they had THE BEST burritos.  My kids and I drove 30 minutes to try it.  The service was very friendly.  My favorite part of the experience actually!

Tried:
California Burrito - the tortilla was amazing.  The meat had a bit of grizzle.  There were to many, very thick french fries

Vegetarian Burrito - my 10 year old loved it and finished the entire thing

Bean & Cheese Burrito - my 8 year old was happy

Fish Taco - didn't look that good.  Was like a fish stick with sauce and cabbage.  My son ate the entire thing though

Carne Asada Taco/Crunchy - would not recommend the crunchy shell.  Didn't look as good as the soft shell.
