To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement and a half. While I love a good greasy burrito (Filibertos), Rudy and his clan have managed to capture all that is right in a burrito, without making me feel like a debased heathen after consumption. Their Super Burrito is the only thing you should order. Anything less would be uncivilized. For the price, you won't find a better burrito. Thank you Rudy!
