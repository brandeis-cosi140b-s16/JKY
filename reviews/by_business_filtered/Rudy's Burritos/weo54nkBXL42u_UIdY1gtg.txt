I have been eating at Rudys for a little over a year now and we continue to go back! The best thing on their menu is breakfast! We always get the chorizo burrito and its made to perfection every time! Weve had the breakfast tacos before which are average but it has fries in the actual taco which is cool. We have tried dinner there twice and it was gross! Each time I couldnt believe it! So what Im saying is that Rudys is the best breakfast burrito place in east mesa! Id leave dinner to someone else.
