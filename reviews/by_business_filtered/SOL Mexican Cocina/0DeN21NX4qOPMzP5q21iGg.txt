We went here on a Saturday night and they had a 20 minute wait, no problem because we could have easily spent an hour walking around the area. The wait was just what they said and once inside we immediately liked the ambiance of SOL. The waitress was pleasant and we were off to a good start. I liked the salsa and thought the tortillas in place of chips was a nice touch and delicious too. We ordered the goat cheese and mushroom appetizer and it was a win as well. Now the part that let us down: We ordered the carne asade street tacos and the fish tacos. The fish tacos were just so so and the carne asade bordered on rubbery. It left the experience as disappointing. Especially for ordering what seemed like a signature dish. We might go back sometime, but we wouldn't try these dishes if we did.
