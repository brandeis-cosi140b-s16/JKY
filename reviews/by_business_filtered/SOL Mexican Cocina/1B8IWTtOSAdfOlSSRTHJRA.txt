First of all, why is there so much seasoning on the tostadas? The ambience is nice but the food is very over seasoned and has a particular bad flavor that none of us could put our finger on. The prices are also pretty steep for the quality of food you're given. Like many other reviewers I also had poor service. The waitress seemed bothered to help us and was often awkward in how she handled normal interactions. Needless to say, I wouldn't go back.
