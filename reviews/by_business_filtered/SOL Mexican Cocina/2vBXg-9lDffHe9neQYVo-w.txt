Was looking for a place to have some guacamole/margaritas while on vacation in the Scottsdale area, and found Sol to be an excellent place to consume both!

The restaurant itself has a nice, open space and feel to it (seems to be common with the places I visited in Arizona). Upon sitting down, received a bowl of baked corn tortillas with different spices and salsa/seasonings/hot sauce which was a nice departure from standard Tostitos and salsa that restaurants will sometimes default to.

Ordered a jalapeno margarita which was done right - just the right amount of spice, and didn't confuse my senses or 'offend' my order. Some bars I've been to will think that they need to compensate against the fire of the jalapeno by adding extra sweetness - not here! When I order a jalapeno margarita, it's because I like things to be spicy and I like tequila. Sol seemed to understand this, and both were delivered to my satisfaction.

As for the guacamole, we ordered some tropical'ish variety - was feeling adventurous - and this came with goat cheese, sweet peppers, and goat cheese. This was a creamier and more savory version of the traditional, but complimented the saltiness and crispiness of the baked chips as well as I've ever tried. Only downside (of the whole meal, really) was that the guacamole wasn't mixed for us or made fresh at the table. That's probably being a little particular, but hey - when it's done like that, it really is the best.

Because I filled up on all of the other good stuff, I only had room for one taco, and I chose the fish. This was a good taco, not great or anything. The freshness and snap of the ingredients left a little to be desired - the fish was kind of bland, and the salsa/other toppings were just, ya know, good. 

Didn't try any of the entrees or anything, so the review is from more of an appetizer/small plate/drink perspective, but Sol does a good job in this area all the same.
