We tried Sol Concina about a week ago on a Saturday night. The disinterested hostess sat us right in the doorway to the patio under a vent that felt like an industrial fan blowing on us. No big deal. I just asked if we could be moved to a much more comfortable table she walked us right past in the first place. 

We ordered. Then waited. And waited. About 45 minutes later we caught the waitress and asked about our food. I guess they lost the ticket. They got our food to us pretty quick at that point. 

Two bright spots. The manager came over to our table and he handled things well. Picked up desert and also took some money off our bill. The food was also decent. 

Those two bright spots convinced us to go back for lunch today. We never made it past the rude hostess. I can deal with disinterested but she was awful. A family came in behind us and she was just as short with them. The strange thing was that the same manager was only 10 feet away and didn't seem to notice a thing. We couldn't have felt less welcome so we left. 

Amazing how much damage a 'hostess' can do. The manager seems good at customer service but maybe not so good at managing staff.
