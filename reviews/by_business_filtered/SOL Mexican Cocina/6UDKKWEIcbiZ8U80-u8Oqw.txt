I went here late on a Sunday night. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the kitchen and bar was open until 10 PM on a Sunday.

I sat at the bar and had Kristen the bartender take care of me. She was excellent, great service!

They have an indoor and outdoor bar as well as a lot of tables. There's plenty of room in this restaurant.

The food tasted good, very fresh, and the service was fast. The drinks were pretty good, and I believe you get a better value by getting the large margarita versus the regular size margarita.  

Things can get expensive here quickly, especially if you enjoy a few of their margaritas. 

Overall this was good food, good drinks, a very friendly atmosphere and great service.
