Definitely not impressed. We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday. The weather was not too bad because of sprinkling so, we sat on the patio. Mistake! Our server was slow and lazy. She took our drink order, pushing the sangria and margaritas. After dropping off lots chips and little salsa, she disappeared for 20 min.

She returned after I stuck my head in the dining room, only to tell us they were out of the red sangria but could make me a white. (#1 how do you run out of sangria in the middle of the day, in a Mexican restaurant, when you're NOT busy and you were pushing it special and #2 if you can 'make' me a white sangria, why not a 'red'?). So, I played along. Mistake #2. It was terrible. 

We ran out of salsa rather quickly and while I had her at the table I asked for more. She returned with another basket full of chips, but no salsa. When I reminded her what I asked for (and what we did not) she said "oh, someone will be bringing it right behind me." Seriously?

We ordered the carnita tacos and Ensenada fish tacos. Food was average at best. Fish tacos were just ok. Pulled pork was cold. Rice was dry. And so was the experience. 

We won't be back.
