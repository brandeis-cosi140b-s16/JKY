The chips and black bean salsa that are complimentary are amazing. We ordered the SOL guacamole. It has a perfect blend of goat cheese and mango added. Simply delicious and well balanced flavors. I ordered a jalape√±o margarita which was average (same as you'll taste in any AZ restaurant). We choose a la cart tacos. Here is where extra stars come in. I like hot food. Ghost pepper hot and the hottest wings never phase me. Then comes their viper taco... Great blend of flavors and a sauce so hot no amount of water will chill the heat. A+
