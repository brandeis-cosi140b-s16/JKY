I'm a fan. The food I've tried was excellent, the space is very pretty and nothing beats open air upscale mexican when it's this nice out in AZ. I've seen minor hiccups in service both times - forgetting to bring out something I ordered on the first visit, not bringing out the tostadas and dips when we sat down the second time, incorrectly bringing out tacos when we ordered a burrito. To be fair, they were very apologetic and friendly (and new!) so I barely thought twice about it. 

I went two days in a row last week, trying the sol and spicy/tropical ceviche. Both had great quality, though for less than a dollar more, the spicy/tropical is the way to go. It's beautiful, fresh, flavorful. So fun! The sol is a small for the price.

I also had the Ensenada fish tacos, which were small but had great taste. Some of the best flavor outside Ensenada itself. I wish they put the lime sauce on the top vs. underneath where the moisture and heat makes the breading soggy. Lastly, I had the Bufalada taco which was surprisingly hearty and had great flavor from the tortilla to the meat, cheese and guacamole on top!

I wish they had a happy hour since I work so close by! I'll definitely be back.
