We always have a great time at this restaurant. We love the smell of the open kitchen brings to the restaurant. The food is flavorful and nicely presented. We usually dine at the "indoor/outdoor" bar where we receive attentive service. How can you beat a Newport Beach based restaurant located in Scottsdale!
