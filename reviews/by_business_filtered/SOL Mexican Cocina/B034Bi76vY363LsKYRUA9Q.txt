The food is pretty decent here (although very $$ for Mex food), it is the service that is so bad. I never have had good service here and I have been at least 5 x's now. Now, I know it isn't just that one server, etc. It is obviously coming from management down. I got there at 445 pm on Friday for happy hour and sat at a patio high top for 4. The waitress came over said that is was reserved for a group at 5. Some others were sitting at a different high top and after they left, I went and grabbed that table. I already had a drink from the bartender at this point. Waitress comes back and kicks me out again-same story. Back to the bar and now I am trying to hold down the fort with 4 barstools as the place gets busier. Finally my friends arrived at 515 and we had drinks and guacamole and weird huge burnt chips, but the guac and salsa were good. Meanwhile, these two four tops sat vacant. The people never even showed up until we left at 6 p.m. We would have stayed but their cheap-o happy hour ends at 6 so we went to Stingray that goes til 7 and has way friendlier staff and cheaper prices for happy hour. The time before I sat inside with a friend and we were also there during happy hour and the waitress told us if we didn't order an entrée we would have to leave the table. We had already had 2 rounds of drinks and 3 appetizers at that point. We ordered one entrée so we could keep our table. Pretty dumb policy. I like this place but I am tired of the surly service, so I won't be back.
