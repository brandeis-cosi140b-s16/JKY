Hands down my favorite place to eat in North Scottsdale. I stay up at night laying in bed craving the guacamole, my taste buds have forever changed because of it. Get an organic margarita, best and most flavorful thing at Sol besides those sweet sweet sweeeeet potato tacos that you won't be able to stop ordering because they are so delicious. Sol will change your life, forever.
