I've been to Sol a couple times before and the standout items for me have been the Vampiro Taco and the Cucumber Jalapeño Margarita. This time we decided to try their Taco Tuesday. We ordered pretty much one of everything on the Taco Tuesday menu:

Naked Guacamole - very good. But they asked if we wanted more chips since we were out after having eaten them with the salsa and bean dip they bring. Um duh...how else would you like me to eat the guac??
House Margarita - it was good...a little too much sweet and sour mix though.
Chicken Street Tacos - bland and dry
Carnitas Street Tacos - bland
Ensenada Fish Taco - it was supposed to have some sort of sauce on it, which I kept looking for. I've had better.
Grilled Fish Taco - my husband had it...he said it was good...idk.

The service was also spotty. We felt like we had to beg for water. There were lots of people working, but it was hard to get anyone's attention. Also, see guac comment above. 

This place always seems busy, but I'm just not impressed. I'd go back for a quick Vampiro Taco/Cucumber Jalapeño margarita once in a blue moon, but for the prices they charge here it's just not worth it for a whole meal for me. Sorry, Sol!
