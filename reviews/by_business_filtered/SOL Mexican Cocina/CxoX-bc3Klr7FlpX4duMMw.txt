Great drinks! I really like their selection which ranges from house margaritas to fruit infused tequila drinks to micheladas! 

Came here for a birthday dinner. When I saw the menu, I thought to myself. "Hmm this is stuff you can get for under 5 dollars at a Mexican restaurant in So-Cal, but it's they make it look fancy and price at $14!"  The food was good and I do like their free chips and salsa (two different kinds), but it was just way too overpriced for what seemed to me like scaled up Mexican street food. But I guess it definitely caters well to some. It is in Scottsdale afterall. 

The service was pretty good considering it was a very busy Saturday night. The waitress was nice and made some good recommendations throughout the night. Can't complain about their service and the atmosphere.
