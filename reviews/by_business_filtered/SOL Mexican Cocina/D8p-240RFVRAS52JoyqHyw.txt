Sol? Good food with very poor service.  
We've been there more than once and each time the service has slipped more than the last.  
Why would it take over an hour to prepare a salad?  
It's too bad; it once was a fun place to visit.  Now, why should I spend hard earned dollars to wait... and wait... and wait for a meal that is decent.... but nuthin' to write home about?  
For good Mexican food there are much better options in the same zip code.
