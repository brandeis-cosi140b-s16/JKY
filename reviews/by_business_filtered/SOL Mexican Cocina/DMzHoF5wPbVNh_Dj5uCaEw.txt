I'm far too impatient to wait the wait that's necessary to get a table for dinner or late night service, but I've enjoyed many lunches here. My co-workers and I love the pomegranate and traditional guacamole and chips. I've had their pork and fish tacos and love them both. My favorite is really their black beans. So yummy! They're a little pricey but definitely a great choice when you're looking for something with a Mexican flair near the Quarter.
