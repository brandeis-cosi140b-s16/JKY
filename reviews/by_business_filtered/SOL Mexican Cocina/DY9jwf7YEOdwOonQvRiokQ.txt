Having visited SOL Newport over the past couple of years, we were anxious for this one to open.  I want to say this about these 2 restaurants. They are not typical Mexican restaurants that so many people try to categorize them into.  They are a very regional Baja Peninsula/Coastal Mexican restaurant.  They don't serve Fajitas or Chimichanga's. What they do offer is some of the most original menu items from that particular region, including their Goat Cheese and Sweet Corn appetizers, their Strawberry and Serrano Chili Guacamole or their Sol Guacamole are also items you won't see anywhere I've been. All of their Ceviche's are excellent and I give special consideration to their Hot and Raw Ceviche... Incredible. Yes they have Street Taco's and their Vampiro taco's seem to be the big hit, and I would definately agree. Don't be afraid to ask them to change something if  you don't like a certain element, they seem not to mind in the slightest.   The Decor may be typical "North Scottsdale" but it's at home in any "typical Upscale" city or area and they've tried to keep it open, and not too formal and again, original.  Just enjoy the place.  I've gotten to know Robbi, Stacy, and Nicole well enough and better bartenders you will hardly find than these 3. They know the menu and their drinks, and are confident in what they do.
