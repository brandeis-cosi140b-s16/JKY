Hey everybody,veggie blogger here! Not sure when the definition of vegetarian meant load up on black beans but Sol practices it.

Ordered a grilled veg burrito. Sounded good on the menu since the burrito supposedly should have had onions, peppers, pico de gallo, sauce, and beans. 

Dissecting my burrito I ended up with an overflow of black beans and onions on the side with nothing else in the middle. To add to that, I had more beans on the plate with some rice.

Overall the burrito was cooked right to my liking. The salsa that came with chips was flavourful and spicy. Black beans was cooked just that there was too much of it. I would have liked more veggies than beans. 

The Don Julio margarita was excellent!! The rice on the side was tasty. Though most of the people on our group didn't enjoy their meal, I think it was good for a one time experience. 

But I don't think it's a restaurant I would look forward to coming back for a second time. This place in the Scottsdale quarter was average.
