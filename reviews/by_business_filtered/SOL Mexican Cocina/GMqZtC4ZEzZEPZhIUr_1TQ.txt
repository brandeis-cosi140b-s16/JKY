Quite frankly, I was expecting an average meal based on previous reviews however they hit the ball out of the park on Thursday night, May 9th.  The atmosphere was lively, the service (Mike) was excellent and the SOL guac appetizer and meal was outstanding.  I would rate the meal and experience a "5 star plus" and I'm not an easy grader.  Well done SOL, especially Mike's kind attention to our table!
