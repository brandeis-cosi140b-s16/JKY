The service was outstanding and the food was very fresh and better than expected.  The bean puree is delicious. I ordered the Taco Vampiro and the Beer Battered Shrimp Taco both were amazing. I have to say  they may have been the best little taco's I have ever had...Everything is made fresh there everyday... If  you like Mexican food or not I would  not miss having lunch or dinner...
