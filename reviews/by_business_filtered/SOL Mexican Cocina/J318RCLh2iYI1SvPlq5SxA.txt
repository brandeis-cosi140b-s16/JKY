I have seen this place before on my trips to the area. Stopped in tonight for some good Mexican and drinks. Was not let down at all. There is a good selection of traditional plates to choose from. For me, the selection of tacos is really good. You can order 1 or a dozen and you wouldn't be disappointed in any. My favorite, the filet and shrimp taco. Probably the best taco I've ever had. Also a great selection of drinks from the bar to choose from.
