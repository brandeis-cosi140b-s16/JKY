The food was good, but there wasn't much variety on the menu. Nearly everything was a taco... taco with shrimp, taco with beef asado, taco with pork...

Lettuce and tomato is pretty shy, and you also have to order guacamole on the side. Otherwise you get an avocado puree instead. I wouldn't turn away an invite to eat there, but I wouldn't crave it.
