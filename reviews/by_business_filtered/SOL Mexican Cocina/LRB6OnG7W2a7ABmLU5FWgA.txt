This place was amazing!! Our waiter Antendo (sorry, excuse my horrid spelling) was just the best! He was very professional and knew the whole menu. He treated us very kindly and was very prompt on filling our waters and getting the food out quickly. He was so sweet! He even made my friend and me cute drinks and took pictures of us. Not to mention the food was amazing! I ordered a quesadilia and it was soo good. I looked too good to eat, but trust me it was even better to eat! I will be coming back soon, and i suggest it to everyone. :) great great food and service. Oh yeah, their cheese is also super good. #ali
