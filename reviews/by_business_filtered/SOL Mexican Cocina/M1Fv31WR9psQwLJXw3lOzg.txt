This place gets five stars for service. The hostess and bartender were really nice, and our server, Leah, was over the top. We took forever to order because we were so busy talking and happy to see each other we didn't look at the menu for awhile, but she was great about it. My tortllla soup and fish taco were excellent. She also brought us complimentary dessert because we were celebrating a birthday and engagement. The noise level in the restaurant is low enough that you can have a normal conversation and the decor is really relaxing. Prices are reasonable. Highly recommend
