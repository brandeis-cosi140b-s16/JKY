Had high hopes when we saw this place,  but what a disappointment.   The gray-haired gentleman that seated us (I believe was possibly the owner or manager) was very blah...no smile,  no greeting,  no eye contact. 

Food was below average.   The thick cut tortilla chips tasted stale and the salsa was bland.   I ordered steak tacos and my wife ordered fish tacos.   Both were lacking in taste.   Our kids' carne asada tacos and cheese quesadilla off the kids menu were better than our entrees. 

The only good part of our experience was our pleasant and attentive waitress.  Due to the tasteless food and impolite host/manager/owner(?),  we will not return.
