Okay I think SOL's rating is completely skewed. As a 22 year old Arizona native, SOL is the best combination of delicious Mexican food and a modern, fun atmosphere in the valley. Comparable to Blanco, the menu is more original but more expensive as well. Their margaritas are to die for, I've tried nearly every flavor.  I hate cocktails that taste flavored with syrup or too much sugar, but SOL's flavored margaritas taste fresh and natural. As far as a food goes, I usually fill up on their unique tostada/bean dip/salsa (as opposed to traditional chips and salsa) and margaritas, I only have one or two street tacos. Filling and I end up not spending a ton as well.

SOL is one of my favorite spots in Scottsdale, it's definitely somewhere to check out!
