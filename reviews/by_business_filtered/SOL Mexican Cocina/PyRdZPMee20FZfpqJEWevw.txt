I'd been here before and don't remember regretting it but on this visit the food and drinks were LAME. 

Pineapple Serrano Maragrita lacked any detectable taste of pineapple and was just as green as a house margarita. There was virtually no "bite." Really? 

Then the Big Chop salad was carnitas had the most bland taste, seemingly under-cooked pork, and fatty carnitas (had to spit one piece out in the napkin-never a good thing). Do they test these meals for great flavor and taste? Apparently not. 

Waitress was wonderful and gets an A+ for service recovery, offering me new drink and entree in a jiffy. Nonetheless, I doubt I'll be back.

Sad, since it's an ideal location at a great mall.

Try harder Sol, try harder.
