This place is awesome!  Guacamole is excellent, I've tried the naked and the Guacamole SOL - the SOL is interesting but I'll stick with the traditional.  Panuchos are very good.  The meat in the taco Vampiro was out of this world and they melt cheese between the two outer layers of tortilla with very spicy fresh peppers which adds even more flavor and some nice heat.  Sweet potato and black bean tacos were great too.  Short Rib Barbacoa is incredible!!  Their rice and beans on the side are also very good.  White corn poblano soup is delicious with a little heat.  Good salsa and they gave us a hot sauce that was pretty serious.

All three trips were take out so I can't comment on the service.  Parking is terrible but that goes without saying.  Prices are cheap for what you get.
