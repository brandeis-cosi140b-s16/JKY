The comp. salsa and been dip with tostadas was a fun and tasty way to greet us at the table. 

Excellent guac with unexpected ingredients like pepitas and goat cheese - delicious!

We're not big into rice/beans so the ala carte tacos options were perfect for us. Each one was packed full of flavor and really, really tasty. Be prepared to spend $30 on 3 tacos (if you like the steak/shrimp options like we do). 

Dark Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding was just OK, nothing to brag about and I would not order it again. 

Overall, a fun twist on Mexican cuisine with some traditional and unique ingredients.

We'll be back.
