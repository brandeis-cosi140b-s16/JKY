Very Nice! It all started the minute I walked in the door and was greeted by a nice young man. The layout and Atmosphere had balance and it looked like everyone focused and engaged with the visitor. It gave me a really nice and upscale feeling while my see saw a Caribbean type layout, you know, that Ocean front view kind of feeling.

Then came the food! My choices were many and my decision was the Chicken Fajita Club...outstanding! If you're in the area and trying to make a decision where to eat, Sol Mexican Cocina needs to be at the top of your list!
