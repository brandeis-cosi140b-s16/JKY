It took me some time to get here after their open, but since I went a month ago, I've been back four more times - taking different people with me each time to experience their great food! The menu is full of unique food combos and everything I've had has been great, so I just want to keep making my way through it! The patio is right on Greenway, but it's still a nice place to enjoy one of their many margaritas! The staff is friendly and keeps their cool when it gets crowded on the weekend nights, but unfortunately was slow the last time I was in on a pretty dead Thursday...guess they're not a fan of patrons just drinking a few beers and watching a game.
