First of all, best Mojitos! It's hard to find a good Mojito in this town for some reason, but Sol does it right. The tacos are great and the ambiance is way cool. The service was a little slow and we had to ask for our server a couple times. We were there on a Monday night and it was not very busy so I'm not sure what the deal was there. I have been in on the weekends as well but have only sat at the bar, which is cool as it's one that's inside/outside. They're typically packed on the weekends and I would recommend a reservation. Overall great spot in the Quarter for Mexican with an upscale feel without the upscale price!
