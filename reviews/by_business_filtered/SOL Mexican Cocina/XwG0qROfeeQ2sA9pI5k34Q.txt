First of all I am appalled that anyone actually thinks this is good Mexican food. Obviously anyone thinking so has never had quality Mexican food. There is not a lot of cultural diversity it seems in those who reviewed the restaurant and maybe that's because anyone who is Hispanic would not consider this to be authentic Mexican food. 

Bland fusion of wanna be contemporary takes on Mexican classic Baja dishes at best...save your money. It's as authentic as Chipotle across the street. Any idiot can make better guacamole or margaritas. Here is a Latin word to describe the food and drink "desabrido".

The place is pretty and what you would want a Mexican restaurant to look like but it's sad that they think that's enough for the average consumer. 

Our table ordered the naked guacamole which anyone can make it was do blah the tostadas it came with where good instead of your typical chips. But the salsas weren't even as hot as the waitress claimed (she said it was a 10 on a scale of 1-10). My tween ate it like nothing it was so bland. The puerto Nuevo shrimp tacos had no seasoning or flavor and the presentation was terrible. The Baja shrimp tacos had none of the avocado sauce the menu claimed and the margarita was watered down and had no salt.  The waitress forgot to take our drink order and we had to ask a busboy for drinks. She also forgot to come back to our table and we waited 40 minutes for the check. I don't mind paying for good food but hate over paying for mediocracy. Really I've had better Mexican food from food lunch trucks.
