We have been looking for a new Mexican Restaurant in town that was exceptional. The emphasis on Baja style Mexican was a pleasant surprise. We have no complaints about the food or service. Everyone was very attentive and willing to explain the items on the menu. The shrimp was delicious. We had burritos that we ordered wet and they were huge. My husband had a half left to take home. Desert was outstanding and I did not think I had room, but I did, and loved the chocolate with banana bread pudding. 
Supper  Margarittas! Many to choose from. Will definitely return!
Best find in years! By the way, Thank you USAir for choosing this restaurant to review. We may not have found this on our own.
