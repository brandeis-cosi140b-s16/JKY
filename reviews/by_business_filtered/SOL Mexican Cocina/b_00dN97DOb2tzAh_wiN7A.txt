Tried a few food items: 
*The tortillas and salsa - surprised the salsa wasn't spicier. The bean dip they also place on the table was tasted but it lacked any flavor so after one taste, I didn't go back for another. 
*Guacamole Sol - bursts of flavors and I wish we ordered two!
*Chorizo and Mushroom Queso - by far a favorite thing we tried but eat it while it's hot. When it gets cold it's not the same and it's not as tasty. 
*Grilled Sweet Corn - flavorful and just enough grill taste. 
*Street Tacos - we ordered the shrimp and steak. The steak was okay but the shrimp with the mango salsa was bursting with flavor. 
*Peel and Eat Shrimp - our second favorite of the dishes we tasted. The shrimps are a great size, the seasoning is lick-your-fingers delicious. 

All of the dishes were amazing. We also tried their Cucumber Jalape√±o Margarita. Yummy. The only down side to our experience was our server. He wasn't very attentive and we had to ask other servers passing by for additional items.
