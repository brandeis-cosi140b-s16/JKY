Feeling sad, let down by the world? Despondent over a recent hangnail or paper cut? Angry that your boss ignored your fine work yet again? All of these and countless more would be fine reasons to come to SOL and have a Mango Con Chile Frozen Margarita. Sweet, spicy, goes down real smooth. And then you need to have another. And then another. And then another. Unrelatedly, you should definitely have someone drive you here and away from here.

The food was good, I think. I was drunk, I don't really remember. I think I recall it being good. There was some shrimp appetizer where you have to pull off the shrimp's heads. Hey, they're already dead, I say. They don't feel it. They had some delicious corn appetizer, too, and then these cool taco things you can get a la carte or grouped for you, if I recall correctly. Again, I was drunk.

Nice ambiance, friendly waiter. And yeah, get that drink or three of them.
