First things first! If you have champagne taste and a beer budget this isn't for you.  If you complain about pricing in Scottsdale you can always Go to filibertos where your beef came from a coyote or victims of cartel violence. Anyhow this place is awesome From service to food.  Holden, Gio and Mike are the best servers they have there.  They make the experience ten times better.  Very knowledgable about the menu and drinks.  Their appetizers are unique creations.  I've tried several different tacos on the menu and loved the garlic rib eye taco the most.  
You must must must try their Kobe Skirt Steak.  (For those that complain about price do research on KOBE beef. It didn't come from the LA Lakers)
They have the best skirt steak in town.  
Will def be a regular for years to come.   Thank you guys
