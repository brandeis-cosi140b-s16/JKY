Had to give Sol 5 stars simply because of the super friendly and helpful staff.  Food was good, had the street taco fight which consists of 6 tacos and an order of guac.  While I have had better Mexican food for cheaper it was still very nice, fresh and was all well made. Atmosphere was nice and pleasent except that they kept opening up a side door to do cleaning which let in a lot of unwanted cold air. Normally I would knock down a star except for the great staff.
