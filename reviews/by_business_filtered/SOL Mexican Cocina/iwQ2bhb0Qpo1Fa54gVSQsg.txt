Had the luxury of attending a NCA event in the private dining area of SOL. It was on a Tuesday night, I arrived a little early, so I was able to sit at the bar and check out their Taco Tuesday menu + order a drink. They have an extensive list of imported beers, more than I am typically used to. 

Location: Its right in the Scottsdale Quarter and located right next door to the parking garage, so its a short walk from the car to the restaurant entrance, extremely convenient. 

Ambiance: I like the low lighting and the openness of this place. They have an indoor/outdoor bar and a great private dining area for corporate events, private dinners, etc. Also, the high top tables are great, and the lounge area outside with the heaters! Superb. 

Employees: All very friendly, especially the bartenders, who made sure my drink was always full and made sure I was taken care of. Extra plus, theyre all attractive. eye candy for the win. 

Food: The TACOS! So delicious. I had the steak and chicken tacos, with their extra spicy sauce. So delicious. I love that they make your guac from scratch, so everything is extremely fresh tasting. Plus, how do you go wrong on a taco tuesday? 2 street tacos for 2.50! You're full after 5 dollars. 

Make sure you use the check-in offer, its 5 dollars off any margarita, wonderful. 
Did I mention the live music on Tuesdays? Super legit. Its acoustic and not like a mariatchi band. I appreciate that.
