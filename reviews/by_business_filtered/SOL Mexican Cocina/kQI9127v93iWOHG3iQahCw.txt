Was in town visiting family over the holidays and we went to SOL for the first time; so great!! It was brunch time so I ordered a mango mimosa and the crab and shrimp eggs benedict. The food was different and such a nice change from the typical tex mex I am used to having. Everyone that I was with loved SOL and their food!
