Yep, A-OK. I guess I had high expectations with the hopes it would be up to par with the Mission in Old Town Scottsdale. Not even close. The tortilla soup I ordered was nothing to write home about. The guacamole was just OK and the tostado chips were cold and not very easy to break which was too bad because their salsa was really tasty. They should consider chips that are easier to dip into that yummy salsa. I would have given this place 2 stars but the salsa was good and their Jalapeno cucumber margarita were both really good. I will probably come back just for the margaritas.
