I have been to Sol Cocina in both Scottsdale and Newport Beach many times.  In the past the food has been good but pricey as you pay for the "scene" and a neat d√©cor.  This time I specifically checked to see what the hours were for their happy hour on their website and it says "Happy Hour:Daily: 4pm--7pm".  Our waiter Arnoldo acted like we were crazy when I asked about happy hour at 6:20pm.  We received very poor service and should have just left before dropping $117 for inattention and attitude.  I won't be back.
