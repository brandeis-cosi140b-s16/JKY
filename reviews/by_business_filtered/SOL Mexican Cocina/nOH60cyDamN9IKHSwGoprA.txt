Stopped by on a whim for a late lunch / early dinner. Everything was delicious! The guacamole SOL is different but exceptional! My friend had the Kobe skirt steak and raved about the flavors. The pork carnita tacos were yummy, but my favorite was the "Dorado" (shrimp taco). Holden was a great server as well!
