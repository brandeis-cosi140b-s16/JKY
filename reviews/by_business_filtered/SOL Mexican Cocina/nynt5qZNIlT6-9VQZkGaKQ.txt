I had a wonderful experience here. I will be honest and admit that my first experience was not the best but I was extremely pleased with the response I got after my feedback was given. The coordinator reached out to me immediately to apologize and I decided to give it a second shot. I went there on a Friday night and was given some of the best service ever followed by some of the best food. We sat outside and enjoyed the lovely ambiance and enjoyed a tour of the menu.
They have a unique selection of Mexican cuisine and have some of the best guacamole I've ever tasted. I also have to add that the margaritas were amazing! My favorite was the jalape√±o cucumber marg. 
I would certainly recommend this place and plan on returning. Thank you Cyndi! And thank you to the server as well!
