I wish I could convey how delicious the Mexican corn is here. You will just have to try it for yourself. Amazing!!!! I also ordered the Taco Vampiro (carne asada) and the Shrimp Dorado taco. Both delicious as well. The food is a little on the pricey side but well worth it. Very flavorful and the meat was so tender. Love this place!!!
