Brought my parents here for their 37th Wedding Anniversary and it was such a great experience! The food and service is truly impeccable and probably one of the best Mexican restaurants I have been to a long time. We ordered several of their Taco's a la carte and all were fantastic. Amazing spicy Serrano margaritas to accompany the food. I can't wait to visit my parents and go back to place!
