Not bad! Mexican cuisine is probably my least favorite choice of food, but this place wasn't bad at all! I came here on a date last Saturday. The hostess said the wait was about 50 minutes but we got sat in 20! It was busy and the service took a while but we understood it was a busy night. The Magaritas were my favorite part of the meal!
