A group of us dined here last night and we really enjoyed ourselves. We have to praise our wonderful server Amanda. She was awesome - friendly, funny, really knew the menu. We started with coconut calamari, which was fantastic. Then we took Amanda's recommendation and tried the Hot & Raw Tropical Ceviche, which was excellent. Two of us had the Short Ribs Barbacoa - super flavorful. 

Ambiance was energetic, and I highly recommend visiting SOL Mexican Cocina.
