Sol has a great selection of authentic Mexican dishes that aren't just your average taco. 

I was adventurous and got the grilled quail, a tad over grilled, I tasted a bit more char than bird, but overall very succulent. They also make their own monster tortilla chips at Sol...among things that look better than they taste, but they deserve an E for effort.
