Fairly pricey Mexican food...except on good ole Taco Tuesday. The lemon chicken tacos were 2 for $3 and I should have gotten four. Big strips of white chicken, some onions and lemon flavor make these tacos simple, but very satisfying. We also tried the naked guac and a couple of $5 margarita's on the happy hour menu. Both had no issues and the drinks were good and strong as well. Unusual start with those tostada chips and the the bean dip and salsa, but once again these two free starters were top notch.
   Minus a star for the close tables and seating. Really don't care about Little Johnny's day at school, but it is tight seating up front, so grab a table in back for privacy. The music guy was a nice change, but did not drown out the people right next to me.
