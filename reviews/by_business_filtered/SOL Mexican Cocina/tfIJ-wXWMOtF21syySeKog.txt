I absolutely love the ambience and music here. The food is fabulous and so are the drinks. It's dark and cave like but it also has a nice flare to the outdoor bar. The chorizo add chicken with a flour tortilla is the way to go. The guacamole is amazing as well. To top it off there drinks are delicious as well. Get a group of friends and come to sol. I'm yet to meet someone who doesn't love the place.
