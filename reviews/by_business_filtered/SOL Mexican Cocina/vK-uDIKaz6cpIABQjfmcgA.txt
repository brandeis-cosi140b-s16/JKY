My manager and I came here for dinner on a Monday night while she was in town. I had never been here before, but had passed by it many times and was excited to try. We arrived around 6:30 and there wasn't a wait for our party of 2. We decided to start with drinks and apps and catch up for a bit before ordering dinner. I had a large house margarita which was good. The black bean dip and tomatillo salsa they bring out was very delicious, though I wish they had normal sized chips as opposed to the tostadas that they have to break. We also ordered the naked guac, which was really good but very very small for the price. 

For the main event, I decided on the carne asada tacos and we shared an order of grilled sweet corn. The corn was really good, I'd get those again. The carne asada tacos were okay. We waited a little longer than normal for our food and it wasn't hot, but not cold enough for me to complain. I may have enjoyed them more had they been hotter. Our server was great and I liked the atmosphere. I saw they have live music some nights and a pretty good happy hour so I'd likely return.
