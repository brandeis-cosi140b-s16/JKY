SOOOOO nice I had to try it twice! Whenever I am back in the Scottsdale area, I like to eat my old but goodie spots but also try out some new ones! I went to SOL at Scottsdale Quarter a few nights ago and had their Chipolte Shrimp Tacos, it was so good that I had to go back and this time I ordered their grilled burrito. The food is great but once I tried ordering off the menu (meaning personalizing my order) the waiter seemed a little frantic. So I suggest just sticking to the menu because it's pretty good!
