Stopped by yesterday for "Cinco De Mayo" I'm new to AZ from Detroit my BDay is May 7th so I REALLY celebrate the holiday even though I'm not Mexican. 
Sat @ the bar - nice atmosphere. I was a little disappointed because it was not "festive."
1st. Ordered the drink special- some type of Watermelon Margarita. They muddle the watermelon (I luv muddled fruit in my drinks) strain and... where's my fruit? I had to ask for my fruit. 
2nd. Ordered the Guacamole - it was spicy but seem like something was missing ???
3. I came for a Chimichanga "No" Chimichanga's. I reviewed their menu beforehand  & they list a "fried" Burrito so my friend said maybe that's it- nope! 
We ended up "leaving" I wanted more of a "party, sombreros and beads" atmosphere & my Chimichanga. 
So 3 stars for me. Would I come back? Yes BUT not during "Cinco De Mayo"
