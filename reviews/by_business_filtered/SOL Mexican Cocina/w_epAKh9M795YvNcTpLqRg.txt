Stopped with her Royal Highness on the way out of town for brunch and walked in at exactly 10 AM .....  Which is when they open.  We sat at the back outside bar as the Arizona weather was so nice and the snow birds are slowly leaving town, thank God for that.

I would guess by the service that the wait staff walked in a 5 before 10 AM as the service was cordial but dawdling at best. I asked for coffee and was told that they had no coffee except de-calf .....  "We ran out and nobody went and picked some up"

No coffee .....  Really?   At 10 AM??

The food was OK, not great and not bad but just OK.  I stopped to use the rest room and was very unhappy to find the men's room a complete disaster with all the trash cans over flowing onto the floor ....  Apparently, the previous night had been very busy and the restaurant just didn't have time to police up the bath rooms .....   I hope they had time to clean the kitchen!!

The ambiance is nice and the background music was great ......  But at the end of the day, this place is nowhere near the top 5 (or even top 10) for breakfast or brunch places.

The prices were way too high for the quality of the product and when combined with poor service ......  Well, you know the end to that one.

I sure don't mean to pick the place apart based upon details but attention to details is what defines greatness in every business .....  Ho-hum I can get anywhere.
