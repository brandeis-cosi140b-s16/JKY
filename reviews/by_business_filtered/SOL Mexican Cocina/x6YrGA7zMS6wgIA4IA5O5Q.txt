I wasn't to happy with this place.  Location is great in the Scottsdale Quarter, but the food was bland.  I have had better burritos at roadside stands.  This place definitely misses the mark in Mexican food.  They base their whole menu around the street tacos. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but from a restaurant that looks upscale it didn't deliver. We may come back to this place but not anytime soon.
