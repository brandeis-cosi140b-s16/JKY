Nice decor, mediocre food.  Shrimp tacos should not be served in a deep fried corn tortilla with two small shrimp each.  Rip off comes to mind.  Excessive raw garlic in the black beans made them inedible, and I LOVE garlic.  The ceviche was just weird--6" strips of fish that were very difficult to maneuver. I tried cutting it to a manageable size in the serving bowl and wound up spilling it all over the table.  And it was ridiculously expensive.  By the way, Restaurant 101 tells you appetizers are to be served before the entrees.  All courses came out together.  Unless they change their menu and techniques, we can expect this experiment to be short lived.
