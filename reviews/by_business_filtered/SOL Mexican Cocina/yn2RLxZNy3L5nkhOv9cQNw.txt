A tad pricey (hey, it's Scottsdale), but Sol Mexican Cocina really delivers. We were there on a Sunday night, and it wasn't hugely busy. That being said, though, the atmosphere, service and food were first class. The house margarita was excellent, as were the Gubernador tacos, the shrimp tacos and the ceviche. On top of that, the noise level was well within tolerable limits, meaning we could carry on a conversation with our dining companions without shouting. Finally, our server was very attentive without being intrusive. Overall, a terrific dining experience
