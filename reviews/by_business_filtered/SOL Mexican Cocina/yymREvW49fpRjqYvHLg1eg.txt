Aside from the warm and lively atmosphere, the amazing thing is, that no matter how busy they tend to be, the staff is professional and see to it that your food, which is always good, is delivered at the right pace, without fail. It's a detail that can make or break your dining experience. My favorite dishes are the carnitas, carne asada and the cerviches, but try anything.
