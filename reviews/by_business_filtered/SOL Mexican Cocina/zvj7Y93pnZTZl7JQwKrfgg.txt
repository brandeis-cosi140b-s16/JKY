My girlfriend and I recently went to SOL and were blown away by their happy hour. We discovered SOL using the Whistl app for iPhone. It's great if you are a foodie like my girlfriend and I! 

We shared the naked guacamole ($6) and the Baja Shrimp Cocktel ($7) and I had the SOL House Margarita ($5). It was a great lunch for the both of us. The guacamole was very fresh and had a great consistency. By far we like the Baja Shrimp Cocktel the most. It was very citrusy and the shrimp was delicious. In fact, it was so delicious, I was debating whether to just start drinking it from the glass before more chips came! It also tasted like it would make a great bloody mary mix, if you're into that sort of thing. 

We would both also recommend the Pork Carnitas Street Tacos (2 for $4.50) and the Blanco Tequila Flight ($7.50) if you are a tequila enthusiast! 

Overall we had an excellent experience, the service was also terrific. Thanks Whistl for letting us know about these great deals!
