I want to love Sabor as much as my friends do, but I've never had an experience here that helps me out. 

The interior is very sparse but sufficient. They have cans and bottles of local beer in a Coke fridge that you can order. I had the house Margarita once, and it was alright. 

The last time I went in, I ordered some kind of burrito with guac and there was a whole avacado pit inside. Luckily, I didn't break a tooth,  but how does that happen?? During the same visit, a friend ordered chips and gauc, and the bowl of dip had a whole golf ball sized pit in it, too! Bizarre.

Sorry to say, but I won't go back unless my friends insist. Would rather drive the extra few minutes to Phat Burrito.
