Stopped in here a couple of weeks ago and was very happy with the outcome. I capitalized greatly on all the deals found here on Yelp including the $7 for $10 coupon and FREE chips which made the trip that much more worth it. Not to mention, a big ol' plate of chips complimented the fresh salsa bar well. They also put some sort of spice on the chips that kicks them up a notch.

In general pricing was great. You get a lot of bang (read: food) for the buck and freshness was certainly apparent. I got the El Dominicano which was a new take on what I consider a typical burrito. I'd definitely get it again. I also got an empanada which was "okay". It certainly wasn't the highlight of the experience and I think I would prefer replacing it with an arepa or a taco in the future. Oh, I believe it's Tuesday that they offer $1 tacos too (limited times during the day though)!

If I were to offer one main criticism here it would be the cleanliness. Don't get me wrong, by no means did I feel this place was unsanitary from a food perspective but rather tables were left messy from previous customers as well as the floors etc. This could have been an "off day" and is a situation easily remedied but like I said, my one main criticism.

If you're looking for mostly authentic Latin American street food this is certainly worth checking out.
