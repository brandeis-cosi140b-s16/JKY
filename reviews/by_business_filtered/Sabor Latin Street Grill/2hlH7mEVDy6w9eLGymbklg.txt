Update 10-1-2014 ( see my original review below )Well... I went back on a Wednesday. Service was quick!  The staff were very friendly!  Most important is that the food was terrific!!!  I will go back. 


(Original review)
I SOOOO want to like this place. HOWEVER they have issues. I have been there 3 evenings In the last month. Each time there is a different group working....never a good sign when employee turnover is high. The wait for food is WAY too long. Usually at least 30 minutes at a "fast food" type establishment.  Don't even think about going on Taco Tuesday. You might not find a table.  The food is usually good IF you get it. After a 35 minute wait on my  last visit I discovered they had lost my order.  Asked for a refund and they had no idea how to do that. They conduct all of their business on iPads and the staff at the counter seem to have minimal training on it. Don't expect a clean table. They don't staff at an adequate level to keep tables clean between customers.
