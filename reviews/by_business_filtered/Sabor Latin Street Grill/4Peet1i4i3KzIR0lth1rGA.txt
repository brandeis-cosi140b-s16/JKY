Didn't even know this place existed.  Stopped in looking for a quick lunch and saw the diner closed & was replaced by Sabor Latin grill.  

Must saw my we are impressed and feel on this is a great addition to our local neighborhood restaurants!

The staff is SUPER friendly. The food was very fresh, delicious and the menu didn't overwhelm.. 

Highly recommend this to us locals!
