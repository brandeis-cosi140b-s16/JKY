I need to preface this review by saying I love Mexican food. Anytime I have a choice of where I want to go out to eat, I almost always choose Mexican. I am a diehard Chipotle fan, and I refuse to go to Qdoba or Moe's because I don't think their ingredients are fresh enough. 

My brother and I went to the soft opening on Wednesday, July 3rd. We are both fans of the owner's other restaurant (Three Amigos) on Facebook, and we saw a link that referred us to Sabor Latin Street Grill's page for a free meal coupon at the soft opening. We were both excited about attending because we both live very close to this location and wanted to try out this new restaurant.

I ordered the Sabor Especial burrito (Burrito with your choice of meat and filled with rice, beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, guac, lettuce and cheese sauce) with chicken and my brother ordered it with steak. We also shared an order of chips with sides of guacamole and queso. Both of us loved our burritos. The guacamole was fantastic and it was obvious it had been made fresh that day. The queso was good also. They also have a salsa bar, which I didn't try but it was a nice touch to the place.

The prices were very reasonable and the owner was very personable and friendly. I will definitely be returning often. It looks like I'll stop being a regular at the Chipotle in the Metropolitan area (which is going to shock all of my friends) and I'll be coming here instead.  I can't wait to try the other items on the menu. I saw someone's order of the gorditas and they looked wonderful, so I might end up making a trip soon to try those. 

Try Sabor Latin Street Grill soon - you won't regret it!
