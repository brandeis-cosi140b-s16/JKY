This is a great little casual place with excellent food! We have been here several times now and haven't found one thing on the menu that wasn't spot on and tasty.

The nachos are huge! Brought out on a pizza pan and piled high with ingredients. We couldn't eat 1/4 of them and happily brought them home for a snack later. Next time I will try the Dominican Nachos... made with Yuca fries instead of chips.

The empanadas are good, but I wish the Chorizo was spicier! The fish taco looks yummy although I didn't get to try it. Great guacamole and very reasonable prices! Get the large with unlimited chips  for only $2.95.

The salsa bar is very clean and had several choices from mild to spicy. The Chipolote? salsa (can't remember for sure) was especially good, spicy but not so hot you couldn't enjoy it. 

The burritos are also HUGE. Enough for 2 or 3 meals for most people. My 11 yo ordered the steak build your own burrito and was very happy with it. Another one ordered the Sabor Especial and said it was delicious. 

Sabor offers beer, wine and some specialty drinks. The Dark & Stormy was excellent. As good as the ones I had on my honeymoon in Bermuda.
