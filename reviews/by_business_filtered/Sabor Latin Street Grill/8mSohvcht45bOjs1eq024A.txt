Delicious Latin street food. I had the ground beef empanada and a corn cake stuffed with chicken tomatoes and onions! Perfection. 

Not a beautiful building but the food is delicious inside. Everyone I was with was very happy and satisfied with the choices that they had made. 

Great prices for great quality and the salsa bar is great! I will definitely return
