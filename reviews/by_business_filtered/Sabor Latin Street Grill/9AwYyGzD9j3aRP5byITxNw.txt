I came here for taco tuesday and it's pretty much become a ritual now. $1 tacos on tuesdays! Nothing can beat that. One day I'll go and see how many tacos I can eat in one sitting. They have deals each day of the week, but I haven't checked any of the other days out yet. 

The tacos have a great flavor to it and are on corn tortillas. That's how you know it's real, not flour tortillas. Topped with onions and cilantro. They have a selection of salsa in the back for all different preferences of taste and spice. The decor is cute and festive, but it's a small restaurant. I've only been on Tuesdays so it's been pretty packed. I also tried the carne asada fries and they were delicious. The steak had GREAT flavor. All of the food was prepared with a decent wait time, especially when you're looking for a table to snag.
