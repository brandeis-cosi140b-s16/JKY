I am a huge fan of Mexican food and would eat it everyday if I could. Sabor did not disappoint!

I ordered the Arepas which was delicious and full of flavorful chicken. I've never had anything like it before - there was almost a sweetness to it. Definitely a must try! I also had an empanada because I love them at Three Amigos, and this one was just as yummy (dare I say even tastier?). It was full of cheesy chicken and cooked to perfection - aways a favorite. The boyfriend ordered two of the tacos authenticos with steak and he liked em! Monday-Friday they have the tacos for 99 cents from 3p-5p which is a pretty awesome deal.  We also ordered the chips and guacamole which were really good, but we had way too much food and will probably do without those next time.

Beer selection is good but definitely over priced. Example, the Recreationale was $3 something and up the street at the corner store, its $1 something.  We went for coronas.  

I'm a fan and will be back to Sabor!
