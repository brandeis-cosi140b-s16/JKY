I went back to Sabor again this week to introduce my boyfriend to the best tacos in town and we were not disappointed!  He and I have now agreed that the Arepa is the best item on the menu that we have tried thus far.

I raved and raved about the pineapple salsa in my last review, but on this trip it wasn't nearly as good.  I could tell immediately that the color was different.  The first time we went it was white and looked almost like queso.  It was chilled and sweet with a touch of heat.  This past time it was the color of applesauce and SUPER spicy.  I mean, really really spicy.  The good news is that we know they must make it fresh. 

We will be back!  Those nachos look like heaven.
