Came here on Sunday for lunch with two other friends to experience this place for the first time. Doesn't look like much from the outside but the food is absolutely delish street food! You order at the counter and then they call your name when it's ready.

I ordered one pupusa (man, I love a place that a) knows what a pupusa is and b) makes them exactly like I did when I was in El Salvador!!) and one arepa. My husband got a pupusa and a steak taco. We also ordered a side of guac. The pupusas and arepa were perfectly made. Felt like I had just ordered this from a stand in Central America! Would have loved to try the steak taco but my husband had finished it before I even had a second to ask....guess it was good! The guac was great....you could tell they had just made it. The flavors were just perfect. Our friends say that they have tried a handful of other items (nachos, burrito, quesadilla, etc) and never had a bad item yet. 

$18 for my husband and my two meals!! Score.

There was a beer cooler to grab a drink of choice with your meal.
