Sabor Latin Street Grill opened last year in the in Elizabeth location of the former Phat Burrito... and before Phat Burrito it was the location of Snoops Grill. The location has seen some instability in the past but with the opening of Sabor we're hoping this is one restaurant thats here to stay. We've hit them up at least once a week since the opening and love it more and more with every visit.

They're ran by the same guys as Three Amigos and the menu features normal favorites like burritos, tacos, quesadillas as well as arepas, elote loco, and sabortias. Our top picks... get the nachos and head over on taco Tuesday (only $1). Sabor is bringing great street food to the Elizabeth neighborhood and its worth giving a shot.
