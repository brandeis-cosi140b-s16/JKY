Love that they have specials every day. I'm a huge fan of any style of Mexican/Spanish/Latin food and Sabor left me wanting a little more. The tacos were a bit bland but the great salsa bar helped that. Next time I'm going to try something a bit more adventurous and ask the wait staff for suggestions. All-in-all a nice addition to the neighborhood.
