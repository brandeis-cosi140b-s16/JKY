This is one of my favorite places in Charlotte, so I decided to finally write a review. This is a counter-service, very casual mexican/ latin food joint. They have most of the usual suspects like tacos, quesadillas, and burritos, but then they have other "latin street food" that is where they really shine.
My favorites are the empanadas and the arepas. The arepa is a white corn cake, crispy on the outside, filled with well seasoned and juicy shredded chicken, shredded cheese, and this delicious pink sauce (that resembles ketchup and mayo mixed together in appearance, but tastes much better than that). I also love the steak tacos, the steak is so flavorful!
This place does get really crowded at lunch, but they get the food out pretty fast. Also, if you don't have to go back to work, they have a really good selection of craft beer in cans and bottles. (and all the favorite Mexican beers, too)
In short, come to Sabor, I'm sure you'll find something you like!
