I truly love Sabor! The tacos and food are amazing  and greatly priced! I go there at least 2x a week and I especially love the music and vibe but when I walked in to Eminen and loud hip hop, I actually had to turn around and leave. I will go in sometime this week but I just hope the music goes back to the chill latin vibe!
