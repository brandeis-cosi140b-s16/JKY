I'm very excited how much the food scene in NC is growing. 

Sabor is a delightful Latin fast food restaurant that definitely beats Chipotle or Qdoba (ew).  

Decor: Understated but home-y that helps bring that authentic atmosphere. Clean. 

Food: Cheap, small portions but surprisingly super filling. My boyfriend had the arepa; I had two black bean taco autenticos, and we both had the corn. Everything tasted delicious. However, I expected more from the elote loco as I hoped it rivaled Cafe Habana in NYC. Maybe less mayo and more chili powder? Quick tip: squeeze some lime onto the corn to bring the flavors up another level. The salsa bar is pretty awesome and the jalape√±o verde had good heat. 

Service: very nice staff. And quick to get our food. 

Overall, very good experience and will most likely stop by again!
