A great new dining option in Elizabeth!  My tacos authenticos were excellent, one steak and one shredded chicken.  They have a nice selection of salsa, pico, and other condiments for your meal.  Hot salsa is indeed hot, and pico had a nice flavor with lots of cilantro.
 Menu is comprehensive, and look forward to exploring the same.
