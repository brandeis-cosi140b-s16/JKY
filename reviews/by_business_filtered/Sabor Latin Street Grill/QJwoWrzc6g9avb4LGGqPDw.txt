A big thank you to my fellow yelpers for pointing us in the direction of Sabor. 

We went on a Sunday,  about 12:15, the place was almost full, and had just a few empty tables. 

My fianc√© and I decided try a few things and share. She ordered the Autentico Steak Taco, and the Americano Shrimp Taco. I had the Autentico Chicken Taco with shredded chicken, and the American fish taco. We shared a beef empanada. 

Everything was fantastic. The empanada was the best I've ever had. (hailing from South Florida, this says a lot) The Autenticos tacos were better than the Americanos, although I wouldn't any away from ordering either again. 

The salsa bar left a little to be desired, although the 2 we tried were very good, albeit the mild was a little watery for our taste. They have a good selection of local brews as well (cans and bottles). I didn't see any drafts, although I wasn't really looking for them. 

Don't forget to get free chips with your Yelp Check in. 

We will definitely make this a staple when we venture to this part of town.
