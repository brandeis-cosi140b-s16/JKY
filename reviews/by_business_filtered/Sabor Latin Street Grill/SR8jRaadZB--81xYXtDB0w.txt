I had heard about this little gem for a few months. So when my friend told me about this place she'd been dying to try because they have $1 tacos on Tuesday nights, I knew immediately where she was talking about.
I am glad I finally got to try this place out because it is now going to be one of those places I'm going to be at over and over again.
I had the chicken taco and beef authenticos taco and the beef was by far my favorite (not that the chicken was bad at all). It was uniquely flavored with a delicious tortilla. I also splurged and got an empenada and I was glad I did because it was incredible.
I have also been told to come back for the nachos but there are several other things I want to try. Plus if I go back on a Tuesday or any day 3-5 PM I can order anything and if I happen not like it (seemingly little chance of that happening), I can do the $1 tacos as backup and know that I will be content.
