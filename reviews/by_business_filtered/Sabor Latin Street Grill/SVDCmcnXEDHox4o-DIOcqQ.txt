My wife and I tried this place for the first time this afternoon.  She got the burrito El Dominicano and I got the Sabor Especial.  Mine was very good and the guac was a good combo with the chicken, sour cream, rice, and refried beans.  Her's was really good as well since I had a little sample of it.  The place is wide open inside with a fair amount of seating and some spots outside on the sidewalk.  Two meals and two drinks was about $20.  Not bad and comparable prices to other places around town that serve the same kind of food.  We will definitely be going back soon!
