Sorry but I have to laugh every time I hear the word "pupusa".  Disregarding my lack of maturity, Sabor is low key and casual.  Definitely do not dress up even though it is a surprisingly good place to people-watch.

The chicken tacos were my favorite.  I wasn't crazy about the steak in their burrito.  But the tortilla chips were great and they have a salsa bar in the back with several flavors and spice levels that is fun to experiment with.  

Staff was helpful and explained items on the menu.  They definitely serve margaritas with real tequila even though their listing says only beer and wine.  And bathrooms are clean which is one of my pet-peeves.  So all in all I would come back for more of those chicken tacos and salsa.
