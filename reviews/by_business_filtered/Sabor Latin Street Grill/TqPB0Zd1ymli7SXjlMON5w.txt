Food was nice but the cleanliness of the restaurant was lacking and is driving this low rating. I saw other Yelpers had similar experiences. The tables and floor had remnants of food from previous customers which was pretty gross. I actually slid across the floor on beans. The service counter where you pick up your food was covered in taco meat and shredded lettuce too. They didn't have individual napkins, but rather, a big spool of brown paper that was placed by the salsa bar for everyone to access. We ordered nachos and street corn which was plenty to share for 2. We liked the food okay but have deemed this a take-out only spot for future. For now we'll stick to Three Amigos.
