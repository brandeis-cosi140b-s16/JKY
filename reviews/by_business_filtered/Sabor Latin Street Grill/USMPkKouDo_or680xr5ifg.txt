I finally made it to Sabor and overall was pleased.  Having never been I wasn't sure what to get so I may have ordered the wrong thing, however, it was good.  I was debating between a 3 and 4 starts, however, based on the shredded chicken I am going with a 4.  I ordered the Taco Salad with extra pico and shredded chicken. It comes with rice on the bottom, lettuce, pico, cheese, sour cream and cilantro. They also include bean, refried or black, however, I chose to get the beans on the side. And, the refried beans, so fresh and smooth. I absolutely loved.  Overall I was satisfied with my choice, but after seeing the photos on Yelp and the others diners around me I am going to have to get back to try a taco and definitely an arepa.  Downfalls, there was a longer wait then I expected with only a few other diners at the same time and the chips were stale, and the seasoning just tasted bad, like they were day old or something. Definitely nothing to be excited about, although I did get them free for "checking in" on Yelp. I look forward to getting back again soon and will update my review on the other menu items.
