Not the worst place but definitely nothing to write home about.  Just another average at best mexican joint.  The two most important things for most of us is service and taste.  If one of them is no good, the other better crazy good.  Unfortunately for this place, the service sucks.  I know we all have our bad days and maybe the chef who also took our order was having a bad day but this is what I have to go on.  He just looked pissed.  In a bad mood, giving one word answers and not friendly at all.  He also spoke with such a low voice it made it difficult to understand him.  Because of this we hoped the food would just blow us away.  It didnt.  It wasnt bad but it was just ok.  I wouldnt say "wow you have to try this place".  its just ehhhh, ok.
