My co-workers and I have all agreed that Sabor is our new favorite tacos in town. I'm from San Diego so I know a good taco when I have one. Their corn tortillas are perfection and the shredded chicken is perfect. I think they can improve on their carne asada. Chips are also great. Definitely go to this place!
