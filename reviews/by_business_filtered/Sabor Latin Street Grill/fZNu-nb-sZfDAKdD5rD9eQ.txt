I bookmarked Sabor awhile ago when I was still living in Charlotte but I never had the chance to go.  While in town visiting this weekend I decided to give Sabor a try. I'm a huge fan of Three Amigos and was really excited about this place. 

The restaurant was pretty empty when I walked in. I ordered up the tofu burrito but they didn't have any tofu ready so instead I got a veggie burrito. 

The restaurant itself is nothing much to look at. You go up and order at the front counter and there are booths against the wall to eat at.  They had a little salsa bar in the back which was cool. 

The staff here was very friendly. The kitchen is open so you can watch them cook your food. I decided to get my food to go. The queso wasn't very hot, my burrito though was huge. I enjoyed the zucchini that they put in the burrito but overall there really wasn't anything special about it. The chips were just like Three Amigos and are always awesome  The hot green salsa is my favorite, and their mild salsa is also super fresh and tasty.

I would give this place another shot and maybe try more of the Latin street food dishes. It just didn't wow me like Three Amigos.
