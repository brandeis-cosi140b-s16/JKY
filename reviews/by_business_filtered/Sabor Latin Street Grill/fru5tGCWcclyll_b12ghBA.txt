Delicious food, friendly service, and a great locale. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the margaritas were a little weak (in that they were lacking tequila). But other than that, everything was perfect! This is definitely our new neighborhood mexican joint, and I would highly recommend it to others.
