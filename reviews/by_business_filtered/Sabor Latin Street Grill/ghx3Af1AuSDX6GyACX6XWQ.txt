Visited last night, and let me tell you how much I loved it! 

First of all, it is hidden in Elizabeth/Plaza Midwood and I never knew this place existed. My friend recommended it to me because she has been going here for years. I thought it would have been run down because the tacos were SO affordable, but surprisingly it wasn't! 

I have NEVER seen taco Tuesday done so right, and boy was I impressed. It was only $1 for any type of taco, excluding the shrimp tacos. How could I turn that down? It was crazy because when I arrived I was first in line to order. All of the sudden I turned around and there were at least 20 people behind me. Whew, I am glad I arrived when I did!

The atmosphere was great and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. I got the veggie, black bean, chicken, and shrimp tacos. They were so delicious and were cooked to my liking, authentic style. Also, I got chips that came with my meal for checking in on Yelp. I am so glad I received them because there was a salsa bar. The pineapple hot salsa was my favorite! Sweet and spicy. 

I really enjoyed everything and could see myself coming here every Tuesday. I am so glad to have found a Mexican restaurant that I enjoy, conveniently within 5 minutes from my home. Please give this place a try if you haven't already!
