Food is great.  Service is terrible.  The nachos and the tacos have great fresh flavor.  Expect to wait long.  The person who takes every single order is also the bartender. They forgot our chip order and didn't know how to process the yelp coupon we brought.  Again, I do like the food but it does seem kinda dirty and is definitely slow.
