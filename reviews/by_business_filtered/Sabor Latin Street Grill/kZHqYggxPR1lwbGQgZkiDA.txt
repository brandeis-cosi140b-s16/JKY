Stumbled across this place driving around and decided to give it a try. So glad we stopped! It's Latin street food, and it was good. 

Our favorites were the vegetable empanadas, the spinach pupusa, and the taco autenticas. A side of chips is another must with the great salsa bar. 

Charlotte needs more places like this.  Go try them out; you won't be disappointed!
