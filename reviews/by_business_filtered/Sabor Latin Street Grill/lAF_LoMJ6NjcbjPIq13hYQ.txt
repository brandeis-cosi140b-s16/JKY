Updated: I think I originally caught them on a bad night. Impressive and fresh salsa bar. The burrito I ordered (take out) was very good. Food is prepared quickly and staff is helpful 

Original: Full disclosure I showed up at 930 (on a Saturday) when they close at 10. Nonetheless, I wasn't impressed. Mediocre at best.
