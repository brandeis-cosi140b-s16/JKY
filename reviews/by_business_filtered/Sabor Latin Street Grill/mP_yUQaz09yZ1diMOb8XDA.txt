Sabor is across from Hawthorne's Pizza. It has some outdoor seating, but it's limited to the sidewalk. I dig this place because I do feel like its street food but you pop inside and order at a counter and a few minutes later you have your order to eat there or take out. They offer fried plantains, empanadas, burritos, quesadillas and some quinoa bowls and more. 
I was craving a fish burrito from Phat Burrito but wasn't near by. I got a fish burrito at Sabor instead which was almost as good but it would have been even better with a sweet/spicy fruit salsa. I do dig their salsa bar. They don't mess around. They are nice and spicy and have a few to choose from. 
They are always fast and friendly and offer beer and will even make you a margarita. When you check in, you get an offer for a generous bag of free seasoned chips.
