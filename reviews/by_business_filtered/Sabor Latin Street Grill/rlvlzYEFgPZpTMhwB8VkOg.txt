What was Spoons was then Snoops, followed by Phat Burrito, turned Sabor. Awesome food, friendly staff (owned by the same people that run Three Amigos). Reasonable prices, and a sweet bar of freshly made salsas. If you're not a spicy kind of person, I would avoid the salsa roja in the squeeze bottle. To me, it is amazing. To some others you might sweat profusely or lose a few nose hairs.

I got three tacos: chicken, steak and fish, authentico of course, with onion, cilantro and a wedge of lime. The meats/fish were seasoned perfectly. I can appreciate the fact that they grill the tilapia instead of frying it. Delicious!! My friend ordered the grilled chicken quesadilla, which was huge! Delicious flavor, and lots of cheese. 

Having been on the job, I couldn't indulge in one of their margaritas, but they sure do look good. They also serve an array of bottled and canned beers. I will most certainly be taking advantage of these things next time. 

Oh yeah, M-F they have 99Â¢ tacos from 3-5. That's enough for me to commit!
