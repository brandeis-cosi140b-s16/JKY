We purchased the Yelp deal and checked in for the free chips! I ordered two bean Tacos Americanos and the corn on the cob. He ordered a meat arepa and the corn on the cob, and we split a veggie empanada. We both thoroughly enjoyed our food. The employee at the counter was very friendly and helpful and the food came out quickly!  Their salsa/sauce/pico bar was extensive! We will def be back!
