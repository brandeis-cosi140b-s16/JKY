I'm coming up on my first full year in Charlotte, so I'm slowly nailing down my go-to places around town. Sabor's my favorite for tacos - hands down. 

I usually go for Taco Tuesday. Prepare for things to get hectic, even later in the evening. It's hard to say when that sweet spot is on Tuesdays, but I've seen things die down once you get closer to 9:00 PM. When it's crowded, I highly recommend snagging one of the two outdoor tables if you're able.

Your veggie taco will fall apart, but the black bean, chicken, and beef tacos keep together pretty well. We always get the queso - great consistency and flavor, my favorite in town. Order a large queso, you'll get your chips for free. 

I've enjoyed the arepas and the quinoa avocado bowl in the past, but I tend to stick with the tacos. There's plenty I haven't tried yet that looks delicious - I'd love to try the carne asada fries next. 

The salsa bar and beer selection are great. Lots of local bear choices!
