Arguably the best food per $ in Charlotte.  Great beer selection, fast service, and just all around good food.

Located in the old Phat Burrito spot in the strip mall at the corner of Hawthorne and 7th, this place is going to fill a niche Charlotte has needed.  Legit, cheap, Latin/Mexican food without having to go to the ghetto looking for a food truck.  Brought to you by the people that being you 3 Amigo's Mexican food and Salud beer shop.  This place has instantly become a major staple in my weekly rotation of good/cheap eats.

When you walk in there are 2 HUGE LCD screens with menus that are easily readable.  Although, you may think your eyes are deceiving you when you can order an arepa, a empenada, and a pupusa for under $10.  I thought I was that hungry and wanted to try them all.  The beers aren't extremely cheap but, the quality is there.  Sammy Smith's organic apricot ale is AMAZING, even if you don't like "fruity" beers.  You can go as cheap as 4.95 for a house margarita up to 9.95 for Patron and Grand Marnier.  I'd recommend spending at least the $6.95 and getting 1800 and Cointreau.

The food came out quick and boy it was good.  I went over to the salsa bar to see what accoutrements were needed.  The pickled veggies worked great with the fattiness of the pupusa, a little pico de gallo mixed with the hot sauce to go in my arepa, and then a little more pico for our chips and guacamole.  There were some other choices as well.  The salsa verde serving its purpose and then a ketchup based pink sauce that just didn't do it for me.  With all the fried dough, meats, and cheeses I barely ate half of my meal.  Made for a great re-heated after the bar snack though.  The arepa was especially large and filled to the rim.

Bottom line, good eats and for a very reasonable price.  I'll be back again and again.
