umm, excuse me while I squeal for a moment (!!) eeeeeeeee! Our "friends" from Three Amigos meeting me right here in my neighborhood? Ok.. I am all in. Now, I don't have to drive the grueling 2 miles through Plaza Midwood to Three Amigos! I can even walk or ride my bike to this fantastic taco spot in the Elizabeth neighborhood. If you have never had a street taco (tacos auténticos) from Three Amigos and/or Sabor, stop what you are doing now and head on over. They are the best. Seriously the best, no expensive, fancy taco place can even compare. I couldn't even find a taco as delicious on my recent trip to Mexico (I blame the tourists)! These little, yet very filling (I recommend two) tacos come sprinkled with cilantro and diced onions plus perfectly cooked pulled chicken on a handmade corn tortilla, yes, please! I recommend two tacos auténticos, a side of chips and salsa and a Victoria or whatever you fave beer is. You will not be sad. 

I used to teach Spanish, so I know my tacos (obvs!), this place rocks and you cannot beat it for the price and quality. Super quick service too. 

BTW -- the style is order at the counter and they call out your order for you to pick up. Easy and laid back. Nothing fancy here.
