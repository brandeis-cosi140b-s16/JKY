Had a lovely lunch today at Sabor Latin street  grill. Orders are taken at a counter and the prep area was visible to the patrons. A large beer selection is available with half price craft beers on Saturdays. A very nice surprise for me. 
  As far as the food. They offer a variety of dishes from tacos to empanadas, arepas and burritos. I went outside the box and ordered the Dominican Nachos, which are. Yucca fries covered with shredded chicken, pico de gallo, cabbage and their Sabor pink sauce. It was delicious. I will definitely go back for this. 
  My wife had the steak tacos. I stole one and thought the steak was a little tough and they skimped on the onions and cilantro. I'll pass on this one. We also ordered a margarita which did not lack tequila. Very nice.
   The service was quick and the location is convenient off of the highway. I recommend if in the area
