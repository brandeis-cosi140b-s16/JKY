Yum Yum Yum!

Stopped in her for quick lunch before dropping off a friend at the airport.
We've passed by multiple times and wanted to try something new so we stopped in!

We ordered the 

Elote Loco: Delicious corn on the cob topped with mayo, Parmesan cheese and chili powder.
(I've seen this in California served from street carts but never have tried it - LOVE LOVE LOVE me some fatty corn!)

Tacos Authenticos: Corn tortillas with your choice of shredded chicken or steak and topped with onions, cilantro and a lemon wedge. (Be sure to order multiples!)


Sabor Special: Burrito with your choice of meat and filled with rice, beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, guac, lettuce and cheese sauce.
(I got the steak with black beans, these burritos are huge and pretty darn delicious especially if you add some pico de gayo from the salsa bar!)


El Dominicano: Flat grilled burrito filled with a mixture of chicken, cabbage, onions and tomatoes, all grilled to perfection and topped with our homemade pink sauce.

I'm looking forward to going back and checking out some of their specials!
