I have to say Sabor wasn't all that. Had the steak authenticos and while the portions are generous, the meat was fairly bland for Latin food. I guess I expected steak tacos like I used to get off the taco trucks in California, and while the fixin's were there, the flavor was lacking as well as the slightly charred effect that I'm used to. The guac was good, the queso just your basic queso. The salsa bar's hot red sauce was AWESOME but the salsa verde, while hot, also lacked in flavor. The owners also own Three Amigos, and their steak tacos are much better.
