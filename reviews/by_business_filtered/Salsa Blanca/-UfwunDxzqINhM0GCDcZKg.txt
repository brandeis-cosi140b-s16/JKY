Stopped into Bed, Bath, & Beyond with the Princess to buy a birthday card and on the way out decided we were hungry. (Yes, BB&B has cool cards-check it out, no charge for that tip :)  Pulled out the IPhone and went directly to Yelp to find a cool, new lunch place.  Salsa Blanco had four stars and was on the way home, why not?

Definitely worth the four stars and maybe 4.5. Great $6 lunch special with a taco, rice and beans, large drink, chips and salsa bar (they'll give you more chips if you run out, (they actually come to your table and ask you if you need more or anything else which is cool considering you order at the counter.  I love ice tea and they have fresh brewed regular, passion fruit, and mango.  Salsa bar has mini bowls to bring the salsa back to your table and the salsa was terrific, a number to choose from including hot, mild, fire roasted, salsa verde, and pico.  The food was wonderful, the service was quick and genuine, and the place was spotless.  Excellent decor, great TV's on the walls without getting in the way. Clearly a ton of pride of ownership in this business which you just don't see a lot of these days.  As Arnold said, We'll be back.
