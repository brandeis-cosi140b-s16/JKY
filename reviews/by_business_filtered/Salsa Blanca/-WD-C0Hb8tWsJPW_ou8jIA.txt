Not the type of restaurant I was expecting.  Order and seat yourself style.

Prices are low.  Taste is very bland - no spices, no seasoning.  VERY AMERICAN, no real Mexican flavor to it.  Boring!  Salsa bar is a great idea, but even that has no flavor.  The hot salsa was more of a mild flavor.

Customer service is amazing though! Never had to get up to fill up my drink, constantly asking you if you need anything too.

I probably wouldn't come here again, although I am glad I tried it, I would prefer to go somewhere with a little more flavor.
