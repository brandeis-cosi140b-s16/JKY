They say they deliver, but they DON'T... Menu states that they go to Happy Valley over to 83rd avenue, but if you don't live ON Happy Valley Rd or 67th Ave they won't deliver to you. They state that apparently the one side street off of happy valley is too far north!! WHAT!! My major cross street is happy valley and 74th and they acted like I was asking them to go to Jomax or Carefree Hwy. Your food is good, but your customer service sucks!!! Don't put delivery on your menu if you won't even go across the street from CCV... If you don't really offer it unless the customer is across the street from you, then save yourself a bad review by removing the transparent option from your offerings!
