Excellent and I mean Excellent service, very friendly owner, very nice place to eat but the food is just... Very bland and very overpriced. You can go right down the street to Mixtecca and get almost as good of service with food that tastes way better for a lot less. When you start paying 10 bucks a plate for simple Mexican food and it tastes bland well... I will say, their Salsa is very good.
