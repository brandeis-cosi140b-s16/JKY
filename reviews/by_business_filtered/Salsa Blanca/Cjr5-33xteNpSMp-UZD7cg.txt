Excellent food with a lot of variety at reasonable prices. Portions are quite large.  Probably not large to share, however.  They have several salsa choices at a serve yourself salsa bar.  I tried most of them and liked them all.  They could do better on the chips, however.   They were quite average. Located in a strip shopping center there is plenty of parking.   Place is very clean and the employees are friendly.   Downside?   You have go to a counter to order.  If that is a problem, this probably is not for you!  However, they bring the food to you.
