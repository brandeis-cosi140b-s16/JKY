I was stuck without a car and didn't want to cook so I found Salsa Blanca online and saw that they delivered.  I ordered combination #10, the chili rellenos, an alacarte taco and some guacamoli.  The order-taker said it would be 45 mins to an hour, so I set my sights accordingly.  It arrived in 15 minutes!  A very courteous delivery guy came to the door, very upbeat and appreciative of my business.  Generous amounts of guac and the chili's were delicious.  I felt the portions of rice and beans were a little bit small but were sufficient.  Other than that, YES I will order from them again when I have the opportunity.
