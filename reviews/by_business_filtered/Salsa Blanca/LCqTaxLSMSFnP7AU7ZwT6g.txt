I have gone to Salsa Blanca several times now and have enjoyed myself each and every time. The food is very tasty and good sized portions, so as a large man I was not disappointed. Ownership is very kind and social which creates a friendly atmosphere that I enjoy. I am very happy that there is a good Mexican food joint north of the Loop 101. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants good affordable Mexican food.
