This place was a hidden surprise, in a good way.  Tucked way back in a strip mall (isn't that always the case?) it offered a counter ordered meal with server delivered food.  Nothing fancy, but more full-plate style tex-mex beyond the typical burritos and tacos at places like Chipotle.

The portions were huge and they get bonus points for self-serve salsa and pico de gallo with a nice variety of flavors and levels of heat.
