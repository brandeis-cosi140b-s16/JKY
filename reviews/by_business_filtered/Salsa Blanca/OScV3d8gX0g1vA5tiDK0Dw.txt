It should not have taken me this long to sing the praises of Salsa Blanca.  You had me at Salsa Bar.  I seriously LOVE when Mexican food places have salsa bars.  Variety is the spice of life, and I love a little variety in my salsa.  The roasted salsa is more like a normal chunky salsa than roasted, but it still tastes good.  My hubby got a combination special with a bean tostada on the side, and I got a bean and cheese burrito and a beef soft taco.  The beans are really good here, because if they weren't, I'd never be back.  I'm a bean-a-holic.  We both got margaritas that tasted like they were made with fresh squeezed lime juice.  All that for only 25 bucks!  You can't beat that killer deal!  The people who work here are very friendly and they are also quick at clearing used plates.
