This is a great new gem in the Arrowhead area.  The food is fresh with  great value.  We ordered a grilled chicken burrito and it was stuffed with black beans, corn, peppers. Certainly not the same old, same old!  Shrimp taco was delicious as was the seafood enchilada.  Chicken enchilada was exceptional,  very unique sauce.  They make all their own sauces in house.   This is certainly a place the Arrowhead neighborhood needs to support!   Finally a neighborhood restaurant that is just a great place to get a simple meal that is good and gives good value!!
