The burritos taste bland here. I could make better burritos at home with my canned beans! One time I ordered a bean burrito with steak only and I was given steak wrapped in a tortilla... really? If I just wanted steak and a tortilla I would have said so. I ended up having to get my credit card out to purchase the beans because I wasn't about to eat steak and tortilla alone. The good thing about this place is they deliver but I have yet to be impressed with their food.
