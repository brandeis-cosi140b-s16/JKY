Truth be told, my family and I have enjoyed this restaurant since it first opened. We used to dine in frequently and when we moved to 87th Avenue and Union Hills we were elated to learn after a brief conversation with the owner that they would deliver to our home address. As a single mother that is ill and undergoing chemotherapy, on those nights I was actually hungry but severly lacking the energy, Salsa Blanca became our first and favorite option. We would order delivery from them every week... sometimes twice a week during more difficult times. Their prices were fair and the food was decent, but every time I would call for delivery I would be placed on hold, undoubtedly, for the person on the phone to ask if it was okay to deliver to our address because their cut off is 83rd Avenue. Every time they'd get back on the line and simply say, 'what would you like to order?'... that is until tonight. They are no longer going to deliver to us because they just can't go a few blocks further to deliver to loyal customers. Even after I had explained that we had spoken with the owner about this and have ordered delivery from them about 30 times, we were told that they would no longer deliver to us. It is truly an end to an era because Mexican Food delivery is very rare. We bid you farewell enchiladas and chimis because we won't be dining in if you won't deliver. Why should we go out of our way for you when you won't do the same for your customers? So we will venture out to Popo's, Valle Luna, Macayo's, Top Shelf, Don Ruben's... and hell, even Taco Bell... Anywhere other than Salsa Blanca where we will be valued as customers. Adios Amigos!!!
