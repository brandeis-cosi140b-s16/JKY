The service is really as good as the reviews list. The beer glasses was ice cold    I had the beef nachos which were huge for $6.95. I added guacamole and sour cream for an additional $.70 and .90 which seems super cheap. The beef was shredded and good. The jalape√±os were fresh. The refried beans were good. Yum!!  You do pay at the counter but they will bring you more drinks.  For fast Mexican food, this is the place. Kids eat free on Wednesdays
