I have been to Salsa Blanca twice this week after falling in love with it on Monday. 
I ordered the green beef burrito which was excellent! The beans had a great flavor and the rice was pretty good- although I'm typically not a big fan of rice. My mom got the tostada which she said was good. 

The second time we went there for breakfast. I ordered the breakfast burrito and my boyfriend ordered the chorizo and egg burrito. The breakfast burrito was very good! Definitely worth the small amount of money we paid! The bacon in the burrito was crispy unlike several other places. My boyfriend said the chorizo was very good and was spiced perfectly. 

I will definitely be back in the future :)
