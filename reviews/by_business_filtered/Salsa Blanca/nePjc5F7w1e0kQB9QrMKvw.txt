Salsa Blanca is amazing! I would recommend the chimichangas. And if you want chips with your meal, get your food for dine-in because chips don't come with orders to go. I honestly like this Mexican place over others just because of the salsa. It's delicious. The owner is very friendly, I have never seen it terribly dirty and a mess, and the guac is good.
