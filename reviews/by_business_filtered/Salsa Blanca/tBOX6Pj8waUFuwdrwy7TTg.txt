My brother told me about this new Mexican Grill that just opened in the Safeway Shopping Center at 67th Avenue & the 101, Salsa Blanca. He took me today for lunch, the portions are huge for a very reasonable price. I love the decor! Dino and Jenn are the owners, Jenn came over introduced herself to me, she already new my brother and wanted to make sure that everything was fine with the food which was excellent. I ordered the Seafood Enchilada and my brother the Spinach and then we shared our platters. Dino is real community oriented he really wants to get involved with the surrounding schools and different sports teams.  If you haven't had the opportunity to check out Salsa Blanca I highly recommend that you stop in and let them know you heard about them from Yelp. I guarantee you will enjoy the food, prices and atmosphere not to mention Dino, Jenn and their staff. Happy Eating!!!!!!
