Always happy to see a new restaurant serving Mexican food that's good, clean, fast & cost effective, Salsa Blanca met all my requirements on the first visit. 
Had the Cheese Enchilada combo with green sauce. I thought they were the best I've had in forever. I'm used to getting enchiladas with overly cooked corn tortillas; not here, the corn tortillas were cooked to perfection and the green sauce was super tasty.
I held the last star back because the refried beans, as another Yelper mentioned, tasted like they recently resided in a tin can and the Spanish rice could have had a bit more spiciness. 
Overall, I really liked it and will be back, sooner rather than later.
