We finally tried this place last night for dinner and it was very good. Clean, well-lit, nicely decorated with fast, friendly & attentive service just as prior reviews have mentioned.  I had the Southwestern Chicken Burrito w/out cheese and it was delicious! The roasted corn was a nice addition and the sauteed vegetables were still lightly crisp & tasted super fresh! We tried some pico de gallo, fire-roasted salsa, and salsa verde from the salsa bar. I'm not a big fan of really spicy, so the fire-roasted salsa was perfect for me - fresh tasting with a mild amount of heat. My boyfriend loves spicy and thought the salsa verde had good flavor with a medium amount of heat.  He ordered the #15 (chille relleno & taco combo) - said it was good, but could have been spicier. Both orders were large portions and the prices are VERY reasonable. We will definitely be adding this restaurant to our weekend dining rotation.  I think we'll be trying out the breakfast burritos next!
