Nice atmosphere and patio.  Good service. The food was just ok. We had the house salsa, pineapple salsa and the guacamole.  They were ok, but had too much lime and I love lime.  The appetizer chicken chimichanga was ok. The chicken mole taco tasted like chicken thighs, which I am not a fan of.  I was told it was chicken breast. My husband had the green chili chicken enchilada and it was good.  We were excited to try a New Mexican restaurant and were disappointed.
