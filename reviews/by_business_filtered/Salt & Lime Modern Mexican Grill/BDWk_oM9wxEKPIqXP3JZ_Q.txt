1st time here and came for lunch!
 Great looking decor, very comfortable. Terrific and attentive staff that really knows what their food tastes like so that they can answer questions. The chips were not greasy and salsa amazing (on the sweeter side which I like). I had the Chili Relleno filled with carnitas. The meat was spectacular as was the rest of it. Came with red and green sauce. Beautiful presentation. Can't wait to come back and have Carnitas for dinner. Also had the Chicken Tanga taco. The meat was tender and flavorful. Only had one and did not need more for a lunch (taco was totally filled)!
We will definately be back! If we didn't have dinner plans, we would be here tonight!!
GREAT to finally have wonderful Mexican fare in the area!
