I'm picky about my Mexican food, being an AZ native. I have had a LOT of bad and some good. I've had fresh, fried, corn, flour, every bean you can think of, enchiladas that resembled chimichangas... Jk. :) that being said, their food is good! The staff is nice and easygoing, but attentive without being overbearing. I go here a lot and my favorites are fish tacos, bean anything, and tamales, tacos in general are great. Churros are delicious. A regular staple in going out. 

Also, cozy patio with misters and indoor/outdoor bar are nice options!!
