I'm not a fan of these trendy "gastro-pub" places. A little to "hipster" for my blood. Anyway....

We went in for a quick bite and that's pretty much what we got. We both ordered the "street tacos". I love that term. "Street tacos". Especially when served at a trendy gourmet type "gastro pub". It's the best oxymoron of modern cuisine. 

We also ordered the small quac and chips with salsa. The garden salsa is really bland and the "hot" variation isn't much hotter. The salsa verde was the best. Especially on those gourmet street tacos. I had the carnita, beef, and chicken tacos. Of the three, the pork was the best. The beef a little bland, and the chicken dried out and stringy. The guacamole was the furthest thing from traditional guacamole I've ever had. Oranges slices?  Weird. Can't say I was a fan. 

Anyway. Two appetizer orders of street tacos, chips and quac, an iced tea and a coke = $30 bucks and still hungry. 

Not sure if I'll go back. I get the "gastro pub" business model. I just don't drink enough to appreciate it much anymore. If I did still drink like I used to, I would have found the food unquestionably delicious.
