A friend and I met here for lunch yesterday bc it was the half way point from both of our jobs. The chips and salsa was amazing. She ordered a vegetarian bowl and I ordered a chicken bowl. It looked yummy when it arrived bc it was covered in guacamole and pico. When I started mixing it around something didn't look right, sure enough I pulled RAW chicken out of it! I have a sensitive stomach as it is so thank God I stopped myself from eating it! I set the raw pieces on the side of my plate hoping our waiter would come by and see it. He never came back by to ask how we were doing so I finally handed it to the bus boy who took it away. Our waiter finally shower up with our check which showed he had removed my plate from the bill but didn't say a word! No thank you or I'm sorry! Very disappointed and will never be back.
