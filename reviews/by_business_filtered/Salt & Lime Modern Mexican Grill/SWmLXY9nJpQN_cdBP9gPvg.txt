This place used to be so good. They discontinued their hot salsa. They discontinued their great recipes. The waitress told us that it is because they are trying to accommodate all allergies and all sensitivities of people. Give me a break, you go out to eat to eat good food. My son has every allergy known to man and we figure out things that work on menus. We do not expect menus to accommodate everyone. It should be about good food and then everyone will come.
