Went here for lunch with a client.
Nice atmosphere inside, dark woods, dim lighting and open.
Food- The carnitas tacos were actually excellent. I also had the beer battered fish taco, average. Was small piece of fish and overly battered.
Chips and salsa were free and the chips were good but the standard salsa fell short.
Margaritas- I would avoid them. I noticed they use pre-made mixes like you would get in a store. For example the mango mix came straight out of a plastic bottle. If you are going to charge a decent price for a drink, it better be fresh ingredients. Unfortunately, the bartenders do not take pride (or ownership doesn't offer them to use fresh) ingredients. So, stick with beer or your basic gin/tonic type drink. 

Overall, it was a good experience and will be back.
