The barbacoamobile basically has 2 gears - OK, and OMFG. The barbacoa here falls into the former category. Decent, but nothing in particular to set it apart. The pork belly taco was similarly flat, although the ingredients were clearly fresh. Nothing in terms of quantity or quality to justify the $5 per taco. I've had way better tacos for half the price, way better burritos for a dollar more.

Salsas get higher marks, if somewhat hit or miss. Tomatillo is a personal favorite of mine, and this place nails it. Perfect consistency, only slightly sweet. Salsa fresca is great as well. Big miss on the chile de arbol, their hottest. Decently hot, not particularly flavorful, the consistency of steak sauce. 


Friendly service at the bar.
