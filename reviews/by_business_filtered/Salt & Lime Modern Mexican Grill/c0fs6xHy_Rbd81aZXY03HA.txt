I don't know if the two previous Yelpers went to the same establishment. I was excited a new restaurant was opening in the area because the current options are limited. The food was bland, portions we're light, and their "Complimentary chips" were nonexistent.I mean, isn't that the most basic thing you have at a "Mexican grill"? And to top it off their service is terrible. I left still hungry and agitated. Do yourself a favor and pass this place by, you're not missing anything.
