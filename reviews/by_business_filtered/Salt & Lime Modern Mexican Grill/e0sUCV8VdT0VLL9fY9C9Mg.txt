Had a great time tonight at Salt & Lime. Food was so good and the service was amazing. Joe was our server and was such a sweetheart! We brought our two little girls in with us. Our 1.5 year old wanted her own margarita, so Joe surprised her with a margarita glass full of lemonade. Love when people make your kids feel welcome too! We had guacamole, queso, salmon con tamale, carne asada fajitas and the kids chicken quesadilla. Everything was awesome. Definitely our New Mexican spot!
