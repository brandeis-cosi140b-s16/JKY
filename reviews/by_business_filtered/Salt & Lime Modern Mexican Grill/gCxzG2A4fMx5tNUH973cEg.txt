We visited on 1/29/15 for lunch. The location in a strip mall is never one of my favorites but I did like the cozy atmosphere of the restaurant. Smaller than I thought it would be  but glad it was.  I am in a wheelchair due to a hip surgery gone awry so the hostess (?) pulled the chair away so I could roll up to the table. Good service, friendly staff. We started with the Mini Enchiladas...tasty but a tad spicy for me. Hubby said the more he ate, the more he liked them. Chips and Salsa...salsa was really good...has a little heat and very flavorful. Had 3 Carne Asada street tacos w/Street Corn and Mango Jicama slaw. Carne Asada could have used a tad more seasoning...tasted kind of bland but I put some Pineapple Salsa on it...better. I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED the Street Corn...perfect if you add a dash of salt. I could make a meal of that. Jicama Slaw was a nice, light touch...had Flan for dessert...fantastic! The caramel sauce was divine...nice and thick not watery like some flan. House Margarita was very good...light and refreshing! If you're looking for Tex-Mex food this is not for you..this is much fresher, tastier and more authentic than everything smothered in cheese...will definitely go back to try their other offerings.
