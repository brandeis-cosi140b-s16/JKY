I am giving Salt & Lime 3 stars because of the service.  It was great.  Our server was incredibly attentive and offered some great suggestions for our meals.

That being said, the remainder of our dining experience was significantly less impressive.  We received no free chips and salsa - not a huge deal but I thought it worth mentioning.  The food both looks and sounds impressive but it was incredibly bland.  I got the tamales and honestly, I have purchased more flavorful tamales from a gentleman selling them in the parking lot at Fry's.  Salt & Lime's tamales were also not very filling - I was hungry about an hour later.  My boyfriend got the crispy pork which was not crispy or seasoned in any way prior to cooking.  The street corn, however, was excellent and by far the best side dish that they had.

All in all, at $15-$17 a plate, it was not worth it if you are looking for flavorful Mexican food.  We more than likely will not be back, particularly with so many other, better options in the area.
