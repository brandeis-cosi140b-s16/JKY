We visited Salt & Lime on a Sunday afternoon. Service was fast and efficient.  We loved the quinoa and shrimp taco and green chili chicken enchiladas. The pineapple salsa was fabulous, as was the tres leches. Price was reasonable and overall the food was very fresh and delicious. We will definitely come back soon!
