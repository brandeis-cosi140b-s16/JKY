This is my new favorite Mexican restaurant. My husband and I have been here several times for happy hour and even brought family a few times to share the experience. The first time we went for happy hour, our waitress was extremely happy and helpful. When we asked about the drinks, she offered her favorites and discussed the different liquor "floats" we could add. I opted for the shop special which is the house margarita on the rocks. My husband went with the casarita which is the house margarita but frozen. We both tried blackberry as a float but my favorite is the prickly pear. Since then, these have pretty much our go to drinks. 

As for appetizers, we have tried the guacamole, the chili relleno with shrimp, the nachos, and the quesadilla. The chili relleno is definitely our favorite as we've ordered it several times.  For entrees, I love the tacos. They have a wide variety and two are plenty (especially after some appetizers). My favorite tacos are the pork belly and the barbacoa. My husband has tried their green chili chicken enchiladas and their carne asada burrito. The burrito was delicious and he's ordered it a few times. But really, the tacos are the main attraction for us. For dessert, we've tried their churros once and my husband liked them, but I wasn't that keen on them. 

Every time we've been the service has been quick and friendly. This is our go-to Mexican restaurant and I'd highly recommend stopping by and checking them out!
