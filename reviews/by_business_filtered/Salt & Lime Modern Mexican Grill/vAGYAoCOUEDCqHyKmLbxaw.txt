I had the green chicken enchaladas.. my friend had the ahi tacos... I was very disappointed... Luke warm.. I think the tortillas weren't cooked.. green chili sauce tasted more like very green avocado dip... big price tag of $14 bucks... I should have sent it back...Ahi tacos were ok... but she didn't get any lime or sauce to go with them.. service ok... we wont be back
