I'm going big here since I am grateful to have a cool place to hang out on the west side.  i dont need to cross the whole city now to get to Scottsdale and worry about my DD getting drunk and having to pay $60 for a cab ride home, not to mention going to pick up your vehicle the next day doesn't require $20 in fuel either.  I like this place, plenty of misters, girls are hot, service is decent, food is decent, margaritas are huge, and the place is always packed.  I know us west siders can be trashy compared to the snobby east siders but we need a place to hang too and if you dont like it....why are you even here?
