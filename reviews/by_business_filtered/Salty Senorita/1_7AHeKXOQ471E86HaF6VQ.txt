I am giving it 3 stars for the ambiance - It's all outside, volleyball and cornhole, a view of a baseball field. You could probably even go barefoot. But they were very slow bringing out food and drink. Also, they have TV'S outside, but most are broken! The biggest problem is that they have no beers on tap! Really?! Who goes to a bar for bottled beer? Great bones but poorly executed...
