So after a 7 year gap between visits, salty hasn't hardly changed all that much. Patio, bar, and firepit all still the same. But not all that bad though, had lunch today on the decently sized outdoor tables. 

Today was their 6 combination taco platter for 17 bucks. Not too outrageous because you get to pick and choose which of their tacos you want instead of 6tired of the same ones. Washed them down with a fair tasting margarita on the rocks, tasty but seemed like grocery store margarita mix. 

I do disagree with paying for a chips and salsa, most all mexican theme remstaurants offer free chips and salsa. Didn't quite make for happy hour so drinks weren't as inexpensive as expected. Not a bad place for mexican, but anyone should still read reviews before stopping in.
