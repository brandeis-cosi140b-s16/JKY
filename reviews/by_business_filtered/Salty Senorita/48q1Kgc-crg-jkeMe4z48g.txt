The service is seriously lacking. Also there's a female bartender there that enjoys ignoring other females. Other than that, cheap specials. Fundido is good. This place is way too "west valley" for me so I probably won't be back, went for a friends birthday. If you enjoy mediocre service and bro dudes, this is your spot!!!
