I only give it 1 star because I have to give it something!  Went here with friends and the we were 1 of 5 tables and the service was so deplorable. We should have known it wasnt going to be good from the stench of the place as we walked up to it from the parking lot. The place was just plain filthy as well...the tables were gross and sticky and the bathrooms were too disgusting to even enter.  My wife and friends were alot braver than I was and they ordered and ate appetizers I had a beer...bottled!  Later that day my wife was soon sick with diarrhea and vomiting she thought she was gonna die. I live close by this place and it BAFFLES me how they stay in business but they manage  to stay busy especially  being so close to the Spring training  facilities.  I know it can't be from REPEAT business! Certainly won't be from us!
