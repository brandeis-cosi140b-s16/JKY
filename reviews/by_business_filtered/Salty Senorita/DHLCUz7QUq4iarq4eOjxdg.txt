Disappointed, I used to come here a couple years ago it was fun. They had a good selection in their menu, food was great and an amazing margarita menu. Their menus are now only one page front and back, food is mediocre, they did away with the margarita menu, and to top it off they don't serve draft beer (who doesn't serve draft beer?!). Will not come back again. Only thing positive was service was good.
