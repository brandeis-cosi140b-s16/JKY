Happy hour lasts from 3-7pm. $4 margaritas and beers are cheaper at $2-3 a bottle. Fat Tire was the closes thing I could get to a dark beer, but I kind of expected that seeing as how I'm not at a brewery. I'm at a Mexican cantina type place, so no worries there!

Service was decent. Waiters and waitresses were pretty attentive initially around 5-7pm, but then as the night proceeded on and more and more people came strolling in, then the service started to go on the wayside a bit. Our poor waitress was running inside to our table and then going back outside to take care of patrons sitting out there as well. 

Food? As far as happy hour food goes, it is affordable to say the least. The cheese fundido dip with chips seemed to be the "go-to" for a lot of people. I also enjoyed the taquitos with guacamole. I wasn't overly impressed with the food, but it's happy hour food and it was decent, and it was absorbing the beer and margarita consumption fairly well, so my friends and I were content and happy. 

There's plenty of activities to be involved in outside. The stretch of sand where corn hole was played was right next to one of the baseball fields with a nice view of the sunset. There is also one nice sand volleyball court that was busy all night. As laid back as the place was I was surprised to see the crowd really "get down" with the DJ playing. Overall, it seems like a fun place to hang out at. I should know, we ended up staying there until 11ish that evening when we were supposed to stay just for happy hour.
