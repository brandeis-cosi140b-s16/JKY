If your favorite part of the bar is a good patio, Salty Senoritas will be heaven for you! There were bonfires, volleyball courts, and countless tables. I was just one of hundreds of thirsty customers gawking at the UofA vs. ASU game. 

This is the largest parking lot I've seen for any bar. Ever. It will be a journey actually getting to the door, and don't try any shenanigans as cops love to cruise around everywhere. Security is kind of pompous, but all bark and no bite. They should decide whether or not they feel like enforcing the unwritten dress code. Also, you can only shine your flashlight on a man's license so many times before you start to annoy us all.

You'll find that once you're inside the staff is rather efficient, making empty beer bottles disappear before you can even snap your fingers. Many youngsters hustling around keeping the place clean. Bartenders seem short-staffed, but still managed to serve me immediately, pouring middle-of-the-road tequilas like Cuervo with a heavy hand. 

One drawback to Salty's is the identity crisis it faces as a nightlife spot. Being mostly outside, it doesn't have the acoustics or lighting to encourage lots of dancing. On the other hand, the competing sounds of televisions, DJs, and close-quarters seating destroys any shred of intimacy needed for a lounge vibe. Unlike the bars I go to exclusively for the dance floor, or the music, Salty Senorita's is enjoyable but I'm left without a particular reason to return.
