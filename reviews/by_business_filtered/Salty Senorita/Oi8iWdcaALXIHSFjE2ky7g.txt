I could talk a blue streak about the terrible food and drinks, but other Yelpers already have and I don't like to beat a dead horse. 

The service.... the service.  6pm on a Tuesday and it was wall to wall vacant. We were there for 2 hrs and saw the server maybe 2 times after our food came. We sat with cold plates and empty drinks for an hour. We kept seeing him somewhere near the kitchen, but could not flag him down for anything. There was a table behind us that sat, ordered and paid before we even saw our server again, and these ladies had an app, cocktails AND entrees. The margaritas were also 95% triple sec. I wanted to get happy at happy hour and this place did the opposite.
