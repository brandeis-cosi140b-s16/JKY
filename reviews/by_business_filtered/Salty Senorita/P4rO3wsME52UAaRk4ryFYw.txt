We went to Salty senorita after a cousin's graduation. The atmosphere is nice and the place is huge. The food was just ok. the menu is a limited selection of tacos and burritos. the service was mediocre at best. They need to talk to someone about supply chain. they didn't have any Tonic for my vodka tonic or any Captain Morgan for a capt and coke. It seems outrageous to me that a huge bar could be out of such staples on a Thursday night.
