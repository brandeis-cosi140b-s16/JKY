We tried this place out last year for spring training and service sucked. Drinks were good, food was good, environment was GREAT, lawn games, tons of seating, just an all around cool place. We weren't happy with our experience, but knew it had potential. Our only complaint was the waitress, so we figured this year we would try it out again. Tonight the restaurant was busy, but not packed. The waitresses were running around like it was their first day and seemed to have no clue what was going on. We weren't starving, so we were ok with waiting for our food. The waitress came back several times saying "im sorry, im sorry, the cooks are busy, its just soo busy!" It took us over an hour to get our food and we had only ordered tacos (it was taco tuesday) and two easy appetizers. The only thing that tasted good was the chicken tacos. The few of us who ordered steak could barely chew through the chunks of meat and even had to spit some out. My taquitos had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp for a long time, my guacamole even had a nice brown crust.  After we ate the waitress came out and basically bad mouthed the restaurant saying she would hurry out too "longest wait ever", when it was obvious that most of the negatives  we her fault (the people around us had a different waitress, larger groups, and still got food 30 minutes before us). Not professional at all. Its too bad, this place could be really awesome, we would probably go back most nights of our trip, but their staff sucks! I've never written a review before, but this experience compelled me to. Thanks saltys!
