Decent food and drinks, it's all about the environment really.  This place butts up next to Peoria sports complex which is awesome for games and events like July 4th.  Their Cinco de Mayo celebration is awesome!  They have a sand volleyball court, cornhole, firepits, dj's on the weekend.  Bathroom situations suck and my car got broken into once that's why it gets three stars lol, otherwise it's a cool casual place to chill on the west side with family and friends
