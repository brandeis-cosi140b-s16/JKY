We went here on national margarita day....their blender was broken and they were unable to make frozen drinks. Huge disappointment.  Service,again, huge disappointment. It must be a miserable place to work because I did not see a smile from any employee, especially our waitress. Food....plain awful. The one thing this place has going for it is the outdoor patio. But even that is in disrepair. Their is nothing about this place that suggests that the owners or the employees care. Bottom line-we paid too much money for bad food and bad service just to sit outside. I guess we forgot it's Phoenix where there are many Mexican restaurants with outdoor patios.
