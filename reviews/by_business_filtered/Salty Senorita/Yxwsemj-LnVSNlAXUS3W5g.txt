This place is KICK A**! First of all they have great service. I love all the bartenders at this place. I normally do not go to the servers but Ive gotten to know a few and they are all pretty enjoyable. Drinks are at a great price, for example $1.99 Pacifico's EVERYDAY from 8-close. They also have great CHICKEN TACO'S, and a amazing green chilly cheese crisp. The nightlife is awesome, always some good looking women in here on the weekends. They just recently added flat screen tv's for us sport fans or whatever they have playing on the tube. That mixed with the newly (fixed) mist system is great for those hot weekday/weekend days in the summer heat. I would give this place a 5 star but I haven't experienced enough food on the menu to give it that 5th star.
