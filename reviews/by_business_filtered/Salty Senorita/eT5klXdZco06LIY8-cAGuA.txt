My friend from Glendale took me and my boyfriend here for dinner our first night visiting Arizona. She said they usually go here for a night out rather than for meals, but thought it would suffice for a quick mexican dinner. Well, she was right. The interior is exactly your typical mexican eatery with walls covered in random stuff and bright colors everywhere. The outdoor patio looked really cool, but it was so hot when we went, we sat indoors. The waitress we had was nice enough, but she didn't seem to know the menu very well because when I asked how large the tacos were in the happy hour special, she said they were very filling and it would be enough for my meal.... right. When I got my tacos they were two taco-truck sized tacos, and we all actually laughed about my two tiny tacos compared to what my dining partners ordered: one monstrous taco salad and one huge quesadilla. At least their portions were large enough that after I devoured my tacos in about 3 minutes, I got to help them finish their food. Overall, the food wasn't bad. A step up from fast food mexican (a la taco bell or chipotle) I'd say. The chips and salsa were pretty boring and still cost us $2, so pass on those. The meal in and of itself was pretty cheap and it was a good enough time to sit and chat without being bothered too much by the waitress.
