Went out to celebrate National  Margarita day with some friends.  It was a beautiful afternoon so we decided to ride our bikes up.  The patio was perfect and the waitress nice as can be.  Unfortunately the frozen margarita was broken (again) so we all opted for on the rocks. The margarita was the worst thing ever!  It looked and tasted like syrup!
When mentioned to the waitress we got a shrug and a weak "Oh I'm sorry"  The food we ordered was ok but the tab was ridiculous the horrible margaritas were $7!!  We left and went to Macayos and enjoyed a delicious frozen margarita.  Thank you Macayos for saving the "holiday" and knowing on National Margarita day you should have one on special!
