We stopped by on a lazy Saturday afternoon to have drinks on the patio, happy to see they had an afternoon happy hour.  After not being acknowledged for 10 minutes or so we decided to grab our own menus.  When a waitress finally came by we placed our drink order and she said she would "be right back" for our food order.  We waited another 15 minutes with not a sign of life coming back out to the patio.  It was not busy at all and there is no reason it should take that long to pop open 3 beer bottles.  It may have taken more than 15 minutes to do so, by that time we counted our losses and walked out.
