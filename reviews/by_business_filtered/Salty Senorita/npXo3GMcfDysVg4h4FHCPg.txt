I've gone to Salty's twice: for Cinco de Mayo and on a random Taco Tuesday. Although it was fun on Cinco de Mayo it was WAY crowded that the line to the girl's bathroom was RIDICULOUS. Long story short, go on a random Taco Tuesday instead. Chicken and steak tacos are only $1 and Pacifico for $2. I really wish they would stock up on Taiwan Beer for a larger variety, but that may be asking for too much. The outside area is really nice, but super hot on a summer day. What will keep me from coming back: unlimited chips & salsa!
