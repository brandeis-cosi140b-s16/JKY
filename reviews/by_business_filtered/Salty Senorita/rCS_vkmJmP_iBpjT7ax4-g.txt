This place is lucky that Peoria doesn't have the competition that places like Old Town or Westgate have. The service was terrible when we got it, the food (or at least what they felt like bringing us) was awful, and I waited almost an hour for a basketball game to be turned on while the staff and management messed around behind the bar. I love the bar in Old Town and this place had about 10% of the foot traffic and just couldn't keep up. I'd wait until this place shuts down (which it will) and hope that the new place can deliver.
