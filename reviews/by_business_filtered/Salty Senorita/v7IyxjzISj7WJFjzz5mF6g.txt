Well...sitting here with my man and we are NOT impressed. The decor is nice on the inside...but the service is non existent!! The beer selection is awful and their drafts aren't even working! One of the guys behind the bar seemed annoyed at us when we asked about the beer and the selection and did not even

 really sound enthusiastic to be working. We are sitting outside and see at least THREE servers. None have come up to its and asked us for anything. Honestly the fastest server was my boyfriend who had to go up to the bar for some ice water!!! Really?!?! C'mon. 

Not to mention the parking lot isn't lit up and the front doesn't have a light on the outside. It looked closed and kinda scary. I wouldn't come through that door alone. I'm only here for a friend's birthday. If it weren't for him I would never step foot in this place

Oh...just to add..went to the bathroom. There is someone trying to sell knic knacks! I couldn't find the soap cause there was women's products all over the counter. And this picture on the wall
