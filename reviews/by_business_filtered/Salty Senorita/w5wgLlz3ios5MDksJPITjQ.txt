Our company Christian Brothers AC, Plumbing, & Electrical just had our Christmas party here the general manager Charles Tansey was so wonderful he was there from the beginning helping me plan the menu for 70 people he made sure we had enough tables reserved the food was on time and fantastic everyone said the food was so good we ordered taquitos quesadillas, mini chimi's chicken and beef, tacos chicken and beef rice and beans yum! All of the food was good.  They had plenty of heaters so no one was cold.  The wait staff was good they made sure everyone was happy and had enough to drink.  We plan to do our next event there I would highly recommend them for your next company event or if you want to have drinks and dinner with friends.
