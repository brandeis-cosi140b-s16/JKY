the hit is the guacamole, made table side, I am a salsa maker and theirs did not hit the spot for me.... but for beer, and appetizers it is cool, some may like the roasted tomatoes for salsa , but it reminds me of mole sauce and i don't care for it, but the guacamole is the bomb... wings ok, I have had way better, but the service makes up for it.
