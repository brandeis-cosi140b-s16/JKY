The service was extremely slow. Even the bill took forever while our glasses were empty.  The burger was overcooked and overoaded with onions. At best it was poor bar food.  Atmosphere on the outdoor patio is good but some fans would help with the Arizona heat. A designated smoking area on the patio would allow all patrons to enjoy their food.
