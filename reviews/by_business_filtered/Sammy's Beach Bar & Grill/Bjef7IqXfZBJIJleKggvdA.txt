Sammy's Beach Bar and Grille is unfortunately pretty typical of airport fare; overpriced previously frozen food and less than stellar service. With all of that being said my wife and I hit this place with a high level of frequency when flying out of McCarran. Why you ask? The Waborita! As pedestrian as the nachos and chili-cheese fries may be, the over-priced Waborita is pretty darn good. You may want to sit at the bar though, as service is brutally slow at this location.

  Sammy's does do a lot of charity work in the community which makes a stop here slightly more palatable. So if you're a little early for your flight suck it up and have a Waborita. As expensive as it may be, it's a pretty good drink.
