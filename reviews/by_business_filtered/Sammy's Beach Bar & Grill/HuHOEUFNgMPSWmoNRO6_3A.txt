Apparently Sammy's has the only decent wings in the Vegas airport.  They offer great hot sauce and an interesting tequila lime ...reminds one of jamaican jerk sauce.  Good service though the tattoo'd rock star bartender keeps calling me 'bro' ..which irks me to no end coming from anyone...so fake, but hey, that's Vegas for ya.
