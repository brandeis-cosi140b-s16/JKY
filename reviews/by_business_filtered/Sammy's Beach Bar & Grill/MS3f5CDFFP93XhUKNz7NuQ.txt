Service was horrible. 10 minutes just to get 2 sodas and water. Another 15+ for a margarita and it wasn't that crowded. I've eaten at the location in the Maui Airport and had a tad bit better service, but this one is definitely a place to avoid if you are anywhere near your flight time. Folks around us were either waiting for their check, waiting for their food/drinks or waiting for their order to get taken.
