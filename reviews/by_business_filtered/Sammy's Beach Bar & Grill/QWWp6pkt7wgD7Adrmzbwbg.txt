This place is not the best. They have a captive audience and they know it.

 The Sammy's beach Bar & Grill is in the Las Vegas International Airport behind the security checkpoint. I can't stand restaurants that put little effort into their service and food preparation. The service is poor to bad! The food was ok. 

On this visit they made our food wrong, which by itself isn't all that uncommon.  But what they did after they served it and we said something truly sets them apart from other restaurants..... They told us sorry, and they didn't offer to fix it and then charged us full price for it?! WTF? I am cool with paying for food I ordered, Shit the bill was only like $20 bucks. But if you make the food wrong, admit that the cooks made a mistake. Then say sorry we can't do anything for you, that just doesn't make any sense!? I was tired from the weekend in Vegas or I would have spoke with the manager. I Thought this was just bad form. How can you run a business like this? What happen to making things right?

In any other environment/location this type of service wouldn't be tolerated, but since they are at the airport with people who just need to eat and can't go anywhere else I guess it's acceptable. 

Sammy's shame on you. You should have more class than that!
