Stopped for a quick lunch before leaving town, the service was below substandard, food arrived with cold grilled chicken and cold, soggy fries. When asking the server for a manager the reply was we don't have one. She asked what was wrong and when we told her we were told she doesn't make the food, just serves it. Her attitude went down further when again asking for the manager and advising us there is no manager and no one in charge in the kitchen. When stepping to the bar, the bartender got the manager for us. Food quality was terrible, would not recommend this place to anyone!
