I am genuinely surprised at the ratings. Sammy's Beach Bar and Grill is an excellent restaurant. Considering it is an airport restaurant, it is then bumped up to REALLY EXCELLENT. 

The food was good and reasonably priced. We ordered the salad with grilled chicken, chili, and fries. The salad was HUGE and yummy. The chili was perfect: hot, without beans, and had perfect consistency. The chili was served with a side of tortilla chips that were also really good. The fries were flavored with garlic and also had grilled garlic chunks in the pile. It was also topped off with some cheese and seasoning. What I liked most about the food was that it seemed that they actually put effort into it. I liked it, and I wish they had a Sammy's at more airports. if you are in a rush, though, you should try something else. Sammy's is more of a sit-down spot and the food takes a while to come out. 

When I come back, I am definitely trying the cocktails that looked super satisfying!
