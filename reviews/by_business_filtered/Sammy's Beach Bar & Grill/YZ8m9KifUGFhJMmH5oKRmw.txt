What a dump!  My wife and I walked in to a server say "we're not serving breakfast anymore" since it was past 10AM (it was literally 10:02).  Which, by the way, is a great business model...stop serving breakfast at 10am in Las Vegas where everyone is hung over and so many people come in for breakfast that you actually have to make it a point to stop every patron that comes in to tell them specially that "we stopped serving breakfast at 10am."  What a money maker!

Anyways, service was terrible at best.  I thought I was a t Dick's Last Resort because our waiter could not have been ruder.  Food was subpar and you got to pay $15 for it.  If you are in the Vegas airport go somewhere else!  I'm sure Sammy Hager would be rolling over in his grave...he's dead right?
