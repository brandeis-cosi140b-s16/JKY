The staff is friendly and the places cute. But the food and drink were sub-par.  I had the chicken sandwich. The flavor of the components was very good, but the chicken itself was so poor, I had to dissect it with my knife.  It had a big vein of fat thru a tough piece of rubber chicken.

As bad as that was, I had to fish mint out of my drink that was so old it was black and slimy.

C'mon Sammie!  You're better than that.  Supply you restaurants with some quality products.  Too sad.
