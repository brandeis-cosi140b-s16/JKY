Disappointing. At least the profits support Sammy's charity. Dry over cooked cold hamburgers, cold fries (supposed to be spiced?), even the sodas were sub-par. The star is for Sammy and the decor. (do NOT taste the coleslaw...ew). No busboy so tables were dirty and dishes piled up. No system for clearing at all. Hard for the wait staff. :^( Tight space makes everyone schlepping their luggage block aisles, etc.
