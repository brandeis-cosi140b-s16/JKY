Overpriced. Really overpriced. I had a burger and it was an ok burger. I really liked that hot sauce they have there. That's the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one. Service was very marginal. Long time on refills and they don't have ranch for your fries so don't ask. Go elsewhere and pay half as much for better food. Did I mention it's expensive?
