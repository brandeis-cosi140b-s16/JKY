We had originally chosen another spot in which to grab a bite to eat before our flight, but when we saw the prices and the mediocre-looking platters, we high-tailed it out of there and headed over to Sammy's. When we sat down, we initially didn't realize that this was Sammy Hagar's place, but my husband was pleasantly surprised to learn where he was. A clock signed by the members of Chickenfoot adorns the doorway to the kitchen, and signed guitars from Michael Anthony and Sammy Hagar are displayed behind the bar. The menu had a very small selection of items, which was a turn off for me. Of course, this may just be an amended menu since it is in the airport. We went with the quesadillas and the chicken fingers with Mad Anthony's sauce and a side of the lime ranch sauce to try. My husband is a fan of ANYTHING spicy. As spicy as you can possibly get it, and it probably still won't be hot to him. Well here, he met his match. Mad Anthony's is made with pimentos and habanero chiles. Nooo thank you, but hubby was lovin' it. The quesadillas were tasty, the tortilla perfectly crispy, the bean sauce was fabulous, and the guac was absolutely out of this world. Overall, a pleasantly enjoyable experience, considering that it is airport food.
