0 stars. The Service here was completely subpar. Not friendly in any meaning of the word. Felt like I was being rushed to leave the entire time. They were even rude enough to put breakfast glasses on my table (I was eating dinner at 8pm) in an effort to hurry me along. The one and only salad was mediocre, but drenched in dressing. Yuck!
