Is it my undying love for Sammy? Or perhaps my everlasting addiction to Cabo? I don't know why I continue to eat here so often because this place SUCKS donkey balls! It seems every trip we take (and you know there are tons of them) we end up drinking overpriced Waboritas and eating shitty food at Sammy's Beach Bar and Grill while waiting for our flight. 

We've tried just about everything on the menu and it all is overpriced and disgusting, including the nachos. If you want to kill time in a bar rather than sitting at the gate, go for the chips and salsa and get a margarita with a double shot of tequila, that way it softens the sticker shock when you get the bill.
