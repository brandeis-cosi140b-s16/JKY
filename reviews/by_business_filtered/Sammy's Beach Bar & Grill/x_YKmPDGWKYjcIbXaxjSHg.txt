Had breakfast here a couple of days ago.  Sat at the counter, and endured a very weak meal of sausage and eggs, served by the most inattentive and stuck-up barkeeper ever.  Bad food, beyond-horrible service, served with a bit of attitude...all while watching an endless loop of images of an overweight Sammy Hagar.  That's an hour (and 30 bucks) I'll never get back...
