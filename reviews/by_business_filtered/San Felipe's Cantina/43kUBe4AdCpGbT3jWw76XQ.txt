I've been here many times and know I've written reviews in the past. Hmmm...where are they? My friend and I stopped in and immediately found seats on the patio to watch and listen to the nearby live band. I've always liked the decor, especially the giant white shark hanging from the ceiling. It's centrally located in the Tempe Marketplace District so you'll find it a convenient stop on your bar crawl or restaurant hop.
