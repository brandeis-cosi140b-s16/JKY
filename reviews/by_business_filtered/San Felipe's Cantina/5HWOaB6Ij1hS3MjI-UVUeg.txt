I went to SF for maybe the fourth(?) time last night. Anyway, this place is not my favorite bar, but for TM it is alright. I haven't had food, so I can't speak to that, but last night I tried a panty dropper with a bunch of friends (out for a birthday) and it was pretty tasty. The problem was the drink was 9$! Total craziness for the ingredients used and the type of bar that this place is. The place attracts fairly obnoxious college people most of the times I have been there and last night was no different. There were some people dancing poorly on the bar (but that is kind of a plus...not a minus.... at least there's something to do?) and towards the end of the night some girl (previously dancing on the bar) was puking. I think that is kind of standard for this place. I probably will be back here for sheer convenience and the fact that everyone always wants to come to this bar after having a few drinks elsewhere, but if it were my choice, I would probably go somewhere else.
