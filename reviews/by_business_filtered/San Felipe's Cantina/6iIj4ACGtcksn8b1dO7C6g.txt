Phillip Eats Sand
By The Rue

3 stars for the food,
But the service was great,
I didn't go with a dude, 
I even liked what I ate, 
None of the patrons were rude,
I didn't stay very late, 
This doesn't conclude,
My reviews to this date.

Ordered chicken fajitas,
They came out pipping hot,
Only came with 3 tortillas,
Liked this I did not,
I didn't order sopapillas,
My friend wasn't distraught,
Your mom is from Pasadena,
And your cat smokes pot. 

A pint of Kiltlifter to wash it down,
A bottle of Pacifico for my friend,
Bozo is a silly clown,
Cookie he could always depend,
Some people have a permanaent frown,
Their troubles will never end,
Bottle of Jack, sorrow will drown,
Happy for a while, you'll pretend.

PASTRAMI!!
