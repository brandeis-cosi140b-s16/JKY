I had total déjà vu last weekend. I walked into San Felipe's in the Tempe Market Place and had eerie feeling that I had been there before. I say eerie because something was definitely off, then I remembered that it reminded me of a rip off of Dos Gringos. I met a few friends there for dinner and drinks, but I would NEVER return. The food was decent, my grilled fish tacos tasted like tacos, but I have definitely had better. My margarita was refreshing, the salsa spicy, but I couldn't enjoy any of it because the service was just that bad. Our server was dumber than poop (Karryn with the lip ring I'm talking about you). She serves us food with out cutlery. When we asked another waitress she pretty much said "F you guys you're not my table." We were handed cutlery from the gold-tooth dishwasher, who ad just finished washing it all. Our serve never even asked how our food was, but she kept asking if we wanted another round. At least she was smart enough to realize that getting us drunk was the only way we would leave a tip. She came to our table to ask if we were all set, to which we replied we were. She then walked past three times before we flagged her down to ask for or check. We tried to hand her our money and she wouldn't take it saying, "I'd rather wait for everyone else." Karryn, who exactly were you suppose to be waiting for, the tables next to us? Needless to say she got a crappy tip. My bill was $19.95, and I left $21 cash. Tip: YOUR SERVICE SUCKS!!!!
