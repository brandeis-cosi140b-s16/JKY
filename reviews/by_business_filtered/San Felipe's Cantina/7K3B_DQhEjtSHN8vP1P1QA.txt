What can I say?  It's not a fancy-schmancy Mexican restaurant...it's a beer joint with Mexican food.  My chicken burrito was good and very large.  The beer was plentiful and rapidly refilled.  The waitress was very friendly and checked up on me often.  I'll definitely go back, although it looks like the bar aspect probably takes over from the restaurant aspect on the weekend, raising the possibility for over the top crowds and generalized douchbaggery.
