Sunday morning football visit to this place found it virtually empty, but open at the proper time. Most TV's had Cardinals on (with no Cardinals fans around) and the portly manager was very nice and set me up at the bar with the Giants game. Service at the bar was great because nobody was in this place until about 11:30am. Selected cans of beer including my choice of Tecate Light was $2, but food specials were lacking again. They had wings at $9, but that didn't appear special and a giant hot dog with bacon, but nothing else on special. Food is very overpriced here and I coul not find an appetizer under 10 bucks. The only savior was $3 chips and endless salsa, which should be free in my mind anyway. The bucket of chips would feed four and it came with hot, med, and mild salsa's, most of which were rather pedestrian and I have seen before (corn, black beans in one). In general, this seems to be a great place to watch a sporting event and have some drinks. Thirstry Lion has their number on food though.
