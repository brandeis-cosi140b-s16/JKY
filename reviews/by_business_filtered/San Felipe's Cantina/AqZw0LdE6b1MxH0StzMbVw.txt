Great place to stop in for a few drinks and a bite. I typically try to belly up at the bar if I'm able to so I can expect quicker service. (That, and I just prefer a bar seat over a table if I don't plan on eating a meal) 

The bartenders are nice, though one in particular has always been my favorite and of course as I type this, his name escapes me.  Anyway, taller male bartender that is very friendly and talks to you AND remembers you if you come back more than once, is awesome. 

Their salsa isn't too bad though I will say it's the first Mexican restaurant I've had to pay for chips and salsa.  I've also only had their appetizers so I can't speak too highly of the food.  The nachos were..well, nachos. Nothing to write home about but again, not a bad place to stop in for a few drinks and a munchie.
