We went with a group for happy hour. I understand that with a group, the service would be a bit taxing, but our waitress completely forgot our orders, took forever to bring our drinks, the bill, and even bring my debit card back after running it. Extremely unacceptable. I wouldn't recommend this place. If you want to have overpriced food and poor service, well this is your place then.
