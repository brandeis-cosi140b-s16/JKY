This is quickly becoming one of my favorite happy hour spots. In my previous review I wrote about the food - skip that, just come to happy hour. The happy hour runs from 4pm - 7pm and it includes half price drinks and select apps.  Get there early and find seating on the patio, it makes it even more enjoyable.

Yesterday I saw these ladies at another table enjoying a drink in a fish bowl and it had a plastic shark. I was intrigued, and actually walked over to talk to them and see what it was. Turns out its called a Tidy Bowl and even at happy hour it is $10. But it is a margarita  has 4 shots of Cabo Wabo, and the server told me it was the single strongest drink they could sell. I had to have one. One of my favorite beers is Kilt Lifter and they have the best prices - $2.25 at happy hour. 
I also sampled the wings - one dozen hot wings for $2.50.

Not a bad night! One fish bowl, 3 Kilt Lifters, a dozen wings and a diet coke for my friend - $20. Say what?! Definitely come try it out - then when you are sloshed, walk around the corner and hit up Slices for some pizza to soak it all up.
