This place is horrible. I had the worst margarita ever here. The last time I was here, a few of us (about 4 or so) met some friends (about 4 or so too) who had been drinking at sitting at a table for over an hour. When we walked in their was no hostess so we sat ourselves at the table next to our friends and ordered some drinks. For the next hour a waitress never came over to us. Fine we were seated close to the bar so we kept ordering drinks from there. Finally my boyfriend got hungry and decided to order some food from the bar because no one had helped us. Well as we were waiting the douche bag manager came over and asked us to move because they were trying to seat people for dinner. There were other tables still available and we mentioned to him that we had ordered food and were waiting for it, just not from a waitress since no one had come ever come over to help us. He continued to try and bully us out because we had not been seated by a hostess (there was no hostess at that time and no one had said anything for the last 2 hours) but we wouldn't budge because we were waiting for food. My boyfriend ate and we left. Such horrible service. Please read the other reviews, the management and service here sucks. We're never coming back.
