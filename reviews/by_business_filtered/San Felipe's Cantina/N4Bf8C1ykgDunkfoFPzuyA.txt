Cold Beer, great food.  Shitty service, went to the restroom and they had sat another couple at my table.  They must have thought service was great, fresh beer upon arrival and chips and salsa immediately after they sat down!

Finally got my table back, awkward!  Then ordered food and finished it before anyone came back to even offer me another beer.  If I hadn't already been meeting more people there I would have left!
