Visited here for lunch today, and enjoyed it quite a bit - although the company was much more interesting than the food!  A very casual, fun, laid-back atmosphere.  We had the fish tacos and the shrimp cocktail.  The shrimp was succulent and fairly spicy.  The fish in the tacos was very fresh - I had the grilled version (not fried).  Lots of tabasco available on each table, so I definitely used it!  The chips and salsa was good - although not much salsa to go around, it was very creatively done.  I'll be back to try some different items from the menu.
