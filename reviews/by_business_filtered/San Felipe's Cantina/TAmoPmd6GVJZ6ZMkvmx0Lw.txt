Please read Sarah W's Review.  

If your in college or single and want a good place to hang out then San Felipe's is for you.  I bet the food would be much better when hanging out with friends after a few cold ones, but I thought the food was very blah.  Service was just as blah and mind you we went when there was no crowd.

Tacos, overpriced...shrimp cocktail, swimming in Clamato...nachos, OK, can't really mess up nachos.  Beer, good if the bartender would refill our glass.  That's that, all I have to say.
