Okay, you have an outside bar and there is live music right outside (great band - Ratio) and this place still has their music blaring causing terrible noise!  And they permit smoking!  Ruined a nice night out too bad they don't choose to capitalize on the free entertainment.  Will not be back to this place, will enjoy the entertainment outside instead and eat elsewhere where you can breath and not leave stinking like a dirty ashtray.
