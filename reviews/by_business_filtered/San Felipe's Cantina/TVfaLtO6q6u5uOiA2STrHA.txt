So, I've only been to this Tempe San Felipe once and it was for a networking event.... all I met were really drunk people. Not sure if that is the networking groups fault or San Felipe's so I'll make this review not reflect that part. 

My most fond memories of San Felipe are my fun college years at Northern AZ University, so once I walked into this Tempe location, I was disappointed--- it looked like a mega-mall bar, not like the San Felipe I remember. 

The crowd was interesting, it had a mix of all ages-- young and old were out this night. Service was slow, but nice. It wasn't too busy but busy enough, it was just a little after 5pm, so the "happy"-ness was just getting started. 

I might go again to this place, just see what the vibe is and when I am not there for a networking event. If I was in the neighborhood, but that doesn't happen that often so we'll see!
