not even worth my time. the fact they gave my card to someone else and then had me "escorted out" just ridiculous that this place is open for business. If you do make the mistake of going into this over priced dump with terrible service (really it used to be ok a year ago... Where did all the good staff go?) dont open a tab unless you want to call your bank to order a new card. I would understand if it was busy but it was not.
