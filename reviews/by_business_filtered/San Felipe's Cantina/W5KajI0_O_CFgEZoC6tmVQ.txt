These guys were really close to getting 5 stars. The only thing that stopped them was that the guy checking IDs at the front was a little rude.

The atmosphere is awesome. Its like straight  out of Cabo San Lucas.

The food was good. I got the super nachos with chicken and chicken wings. They were cheap and good. Great job guys

Now for the drinks: They had a huge tequila selection. Im not sure how many though. Once again, they had my favorite Tequila. Good ol Cruz Tequila. They poured me a double shot of Cruz and it went down smoooooothe. Gotta love it!

This place is good for drinks, good for food, and good atmosphere!

A+ in my books
