My husband and I weren't sure what we wanted to do for lunch on our date day. We got out of our movie and san felipe's caught our eye. We asked to see the menu and while we were looking the manager came by. He talked to us about some of the favorites both his and guests. We still weren't sure but we were starting to want to stay. He said he was going to "bait" us and offered an appetizer on him if we stayed and had lunch. So we decided to try it out and we weren't disappointed. Amazing food, we both had the mini taco platter where you pick three meats and build your own taco. There was cheese, cabbage, pico, baja sauce, hot sauce, we subed the guac for sour cream and then some lime wedges. The meat was juicy, flavorful and savory. I left stuffed and satisfied. We ended up getting the queso blanco dip for the appetizer, I'm not usually a fan of velveeta, but it was good here. I am really glad we decided to stay, and urge anyone else to try it out! Thank you Gary for "baiting" us in =)
