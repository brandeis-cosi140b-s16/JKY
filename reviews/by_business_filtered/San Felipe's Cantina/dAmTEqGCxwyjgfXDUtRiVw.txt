Wanted to watch football and I was in the area. The food is bland, service is horrible. But the hostess at the front was very nice. I ordered the grilled fish tacos... the blk beans were burnt or look like they put them under a hot fire to reheat them. I started with the queso dip not fully reading the description.  When it came out it had chorizo in the center. Well I don't eat meat except seafood so I told the waitress I didn't want it and they could still bill me for it. She said that she'd put in a new order for one without meat. Came back like 2 mins later with a dip that had a slice of unmelted cheese in the middle... yea I'm no idiot. I know they scooped the meat out and stuck the slice of cheese on top to cover the void. Should have mixed it cuz I just might have believed it was a new one. Well they get 2 stars cuz I was able to enjoy the football game. Everything else was a fail.
