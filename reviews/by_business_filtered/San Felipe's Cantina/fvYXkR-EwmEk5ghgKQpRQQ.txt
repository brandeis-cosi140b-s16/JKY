Went to San Felipe's Cantina on the 4th of July.  Their Chips and Salsa are excellent!! I had the grilled Fish Tacos and they were very dry.  My server  was good as well.  The reason for the one star is that the AC was out and according to our server it had been out for much of the day.  We were not informed of this until after we were sat and ordered a drink and dinner.  As you can imagine we were miserable and just wanted to eat as fast as we could, get out and cool down.
