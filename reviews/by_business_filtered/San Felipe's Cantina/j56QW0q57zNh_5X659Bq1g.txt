Summer swelter on this nighttime visit to the marketplace. We sauntered in near the end of a good date finally to grab a light meal. Her two machaca tacos for 7 bucks were apparently tasty and well stuffed for the price while I was head over heels for the $10 Chicken wrap. This had slightly breaded white meat chicken wrapped tight with fried onion strings, guac, lettuce and tomato. The baja sauce, which I got on the side, was a master mix of all condiments, but did the trick adding a mild spice to the wrap. The AC needed to be a bit higher or if they could enclose the outdoor patio it might be cooler.
