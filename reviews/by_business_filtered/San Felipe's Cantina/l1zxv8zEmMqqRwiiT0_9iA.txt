BLEH.
DO NOT GO HERE FOR FOOD! 

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

My coconut almond crusted fish sandwich had no flavors just bland with a crunch!
;)

My boyfriend ordered a burrito and was given something that almost looked like a  burrito minus those little brown spots tortillas get from being cooked. So what wrapped around the stuff? God only knows...


Service sucked too, it took the girl so long to put in our order and then so long to get our check and it wasnt even packed.

:(
