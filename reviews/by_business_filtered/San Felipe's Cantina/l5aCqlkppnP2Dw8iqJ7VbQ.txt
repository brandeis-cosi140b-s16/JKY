The atmosphere at this place is awesome and I definitely will be returning for their happy hour!

I came here for my 21st birthday dinner with friends on a friday night. For being about 10 minutes late, they still held our reservation and seated us right away which I thought was a plus. I did have some friends that were underage and I was told when I made the reservation that they need to be out by 10pm because it turns into a full bar. I thought it was odd that they carded everyone at the door when it was only 7pm. 21+ got a wristband. When we sat down, I was told on the phone they would decorate, no decorations. Not too big of a deal. 

Pros:
Atmosphere
Food was delicious and big portions!
Waiter was attentive and great with refills

Cons:
the music is so loud you can barely hear the person sitting across from you
alcoholic drinks can be pricey and they are small

Our waiter was great but I gave this place 3 stars because he didn't even ask us if we wanted dessert! So no happy birthday for me. He seemed like towards the end he was trying to rush us out because he noticed it was getting busy. He got us in and out within a little over an hour so I was fairly pleased. If he brought out a free birthday dessert I would have given it 4 stars. The food will bring me back on a quieter day and the drinks will bring me back for happy hour!
