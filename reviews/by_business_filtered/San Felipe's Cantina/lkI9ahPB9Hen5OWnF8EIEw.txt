This place has drastrically gone down hill over the past few months.
The service is CRAP and I had been somewhat of a regular and when I stopped in last night for what I expected during the usual happy hour, the "bartender" told us all they had on special was their house margarita for $7. I looked at her and said, "um...what? the house used to always be $5 no matter what and happy hour had all other maragaritas half off and $2 wells...so now, nothing?" 

Either she had no clue about her the specials at her own damn bar or they really dropped the ball on their happy hour since that was the only reason people went.

NO THANKS

Twice now, we have walked in and immediately left to go to Bar Louie. From now on, I'll skip San Felipes all together.
