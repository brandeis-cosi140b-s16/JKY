Great place for Happy Hour.  The office loves to come here on Fridays.  The joint reminds me of a beach bar in Mexico....cheap wood furniture, loud colors, cheesy beachy look....not really my style, but the majority rules in our office, so we end up here.

It's not too bad though because the drinks are cheap.  I bought a round of drinks for 16 people and it was less than $60 out the door, with tip!

So while the vibe isn't really my deal here, it's nice on the wallet.
