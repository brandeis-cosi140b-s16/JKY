So went there last Saturday for some lunch and a beer with a friend.  It was my second time there...but first time I had planned on eating there.  
I was disappointed with the menu, nothing really looked good.  So I finally settled on the enchiladas and a beer.
While we're waiting for the food I ask the server if we could have some chips.  Guess what chips are complementary anymore.  $3 for a basket of chips and salsa.  That already through me off...
So they bring out our food....really really really quick.  Like almost too quick.  Like quick to the point where all they did was warm up the food that was already made back there.
Anyways, my enchiladas where not very good...and to my surprise, my plate came with just enchiladas.  I guess it's my fault for not fully reading the description.  But I figured $8 for enchiladas would have at least come with some rice or beans.  Noooope!  I just paid $8 for two cheese enchiladas.  And not even really good ones.  
Needless to say, I left there very disappointed.  Wont' be going back there again.
