it all started in 97. I was in college and the spot was San Felipes Flagstaff. Had not been there in almost a decade. About a month ago I found San Felipes in Tempe. Had the surf and turf tacos - I felt like I was in college again. Been back a dozen times since. Cinco de Mayo was amazing. Saw some old faces and new. over all, the food and friendliness was spot on. looks like a great facelift has been done. be back on friday. :)
