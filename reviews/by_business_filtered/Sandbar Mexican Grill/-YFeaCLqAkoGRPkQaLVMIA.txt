I came for my friends birthday. A few of us were sitting at 3 different tables near each other.  My friend was sitting by herself nearest to one of the cabanas by the entrance. A big group of people came in for the Iowa game. The gm named Stephen Howard came up to them and said their cabana wasn't ready yet and basically offered them the table my friend was already sitting at. He told her the table was reserved and she would have to move. We were all confused because that table definitely didn't have a reservation sign on it. He removed all her food from the table and said she can sit at another table. She said she will not be sitting at another table and the general manager proceeded to act like a jerk towards her. We asked for the name of his boss and he was so rude about it grabbing out his phone and told us the name of his boss was Jeff O'Neil and we could go ahead and "put the number in our phones if we want" Then when my friends did not back down he finally calmed down and he explained that their TV guy was supposed to be here in the morning to set up the TVs in the cabana and just got there so he needed to seat those people for the Iowa game until the TV guy was done which should take like 20 more minutes then we could have the table back. Which is still no excuse for kicking someone off a table that they were rightfully sitting at but at least he finally explained. It was just a frustrating situation on my friends Bday no less. We all felt extremely uncomfortable after we were having a great time. On top of having to pay 10 dollars to watch the fight when a majority of the TVs only showed the Iowa game all night. The waitress we had was great and checked on us all night. But I have been coming to sandbar for years and will never be coming back if that's how the general manager is going to treat people.
