Great place for Happy Hour. Most nights they have a small band playing in the patio and the bottles of domestic beer are just three bucks. The bartenders are all very friendly and the HH crowd is a good mix of older visitors and chicks getting out of work with their co-workers. Two separate bars that are both outside and plenty of sports on TV and dude will turn any game on that you request. Gets crowded though, but usually a place to sit available most weekdays (maybe not Friday).
