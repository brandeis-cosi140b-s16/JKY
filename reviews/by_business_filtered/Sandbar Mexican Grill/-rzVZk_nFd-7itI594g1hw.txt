The SandBar was a disappointment. The was not good - the bucket of chips they served me had something dripped on the bottom half, so half of the chips were soggy. The lettuce in the salad was wilted. I had a vodka tonic, but the carbonation/liquid ratio was off because there weren't any bubbles.

I went on a Friday at lunch, there were plenty of seats and the servers were attentive and friendly. There are huge indoor and outdoor seating areas. They have tons of TV's visible at the bar and all around. They mark the TV's ahead of time, so you know where your team will be playing. They played country music loudly outside and had cabana's to rent, which looked cool. If you are there for beer and fun, this might be a good choice. Skip the bottle drinks and food.
