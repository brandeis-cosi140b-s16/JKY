Swung by here a couple times this past week and had an awesome time. I bet it's a blast for happy hour and a good place to catch the game. I came a bit later both times for drinks with friends... service was good, booze was pretty cheap for a nicer place, the decor and layout were spot-on, and the ambiance was fun. Definitely will be back when I'm in town.
