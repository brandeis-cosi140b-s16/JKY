Stopped in Thursday night for "Happy Hour". Very disappointed to say the least. The outdated appetizers didn't sound or look good. The beer choice was below average for happy hour options. Wound up ordering off the menu and had tacos. $14.00 for 3 small soft tacos. While I don't eat at Taco Bell, these would have never made the Taco Bell menu.

I will say our server, Rachel was awesome. Friendly attitude and obviously happy with her job.

Sad to say We will never return to the place.
