I guess I can't understand why the men aren't allowed to wear sleeveless shirts at an outdoor, beach themed bar, but the servers aren't required to wear pants...... we had a drink before dinner and tried to return afterwards and the security team rudely refused us entry do to our attire. Normally I would understand, but when we were already in the building less than 2 hours before seems kind of ridiculous. There's a way to handle this kind of situation and this bar did not handle it in a way that would make me want to come back. Disappointing.
