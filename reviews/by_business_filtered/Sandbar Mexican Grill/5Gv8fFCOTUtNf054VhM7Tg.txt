i must be easy vs the other reviews for the sandbar.  the nachos are great!!  i like both the chicken and beef.  i think i can eat that for the whole meal (i'll try that next time).  i had the carnitas tacos which comes in threes and thought there weren't anything special.  i had to try the rice which i regret.  so, i'll stick to the nachos and give it 4 stars for the service and nachos.
