My husband and I came in for lunch last June. When I ordered my food, I told the server to leave off the guacamole because I'm highly allergic. The server told me she was allergic to guacamole too. When my food arrived the sour cream was so runny it oozed out of my burrito and down my arm. I was about to eat my second half of my burrito but decided to use my fork so I wouldn't get sour cream all over..... Um, there was no sour cream, instead there was a large amount of GUACAMOLE that I'm highly ALLERGIC to. Good thing I hadn't taken a bite, or I would have ended up in the emergency room.
