Love love!! My friends and I have gone every Tuesday for Taco Tuesday for about a year now. You cant beat $2 dos equis, $4 margs and $2-3 tacos!! We ALWAYS sit with Michelle, she is the BEST! Always attentive and never gets our order wrong. Many of the other servers rock too! Andrew, Gia, Mariah. And Samantha, the bartender, is just a kick ass girl.  All in all this place is just a good spot for good fun and good times with your friends.
