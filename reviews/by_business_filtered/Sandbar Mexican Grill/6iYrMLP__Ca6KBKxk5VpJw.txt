Many douche bags and old cougars. At least the night I was there.
Drinks were alright and strong. Food was decent. My tab wasn't too bad.

I was wearing my Marine Corps hoodie there on the Marine Corps birthday/veterans day weekend, told I couldn't have the hood on, because it's against policy. Despite it being cold and raining and the propane heater we were next to kept going out.
Every waitress was wearing their hoods. Not exactly fair is it?

My wife was cold, she wore my sweater with the hood on. That's ok because she's cute.

A bathroom attendant, only in the men's bathroom. No thanks.

Bought a water to take with me when the night was over. Wasn't allowed to leave with my water. Had to throw it away. Brand new bottle of water with just a sip out of it.
