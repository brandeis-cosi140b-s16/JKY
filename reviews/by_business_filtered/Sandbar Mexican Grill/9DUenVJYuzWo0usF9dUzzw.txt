Our first time there was on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.  We were not impressed.  We had to ask for flatware, napkins and plates for our queso dip. The house marg was awful. It took our food forever to arrive. Agter all if that, I wasn't really looking forward to the food but man, I have to say, was that Chirizo burger delish! But, we probably won't go back.
