This place seriously sucks. Consistently the worst service I have ever gotten anywhere. 

    My friend and I sit at the bar. A male bartender is right in front of us cleaning and running the service bar. He does not acknowledge us as we sit for 5 minutes waiting to give our drink order. Two men walk up to the service area (right next to us) and the male bartender takes their order, makes them drinks, and cashes them out! Umm, hello? 

   Eventually a female bartender walks around and says nothing but "what can I get you guys" serves us our beer, and takes my cash. Gone..she was very rude. 

   We are hungry and have to wait for her to come back on the side were on so we can grab a menu. I have to call her over and ask for menus.

   We decided it would be better to sit at a table since we had people joining us. Our friends come and we go to wait at the table to order drinks (by this time our beers are empty too). We wait for 15 minutes before I start to wonder if they have servers, or if the servers come over here. I go up to the bar and ask if there is a server. She says yes and sends her over.

    I order the mac and cheese. Late night menu- it says "mac and cheese, with jalapenos and toasted breadcrumbs." I get my small $8 bowl of mac and cheese which had NO jalapenos and NO breadcrumbs. The server said the breadcrumbs were mixed in and that's why I couldnt see them (That was a lie). I didnt notice that there were also NO jalepenos until I actually started eating it. I have never been so disappointed about bar food before! And the server didnt care at all.

   From then on we got served drinks in a timely manner, but our dirty dishes stayed on the tiny table the whole night until we requested the check.  There were four of us, who came in at 2 separate times,  and the server had us all on one check! Pain in my ass. You should know that people always want seperate checks when drinking at the bar and keep it seperate from the beginning.  

This Is a description of my last visit to sandbar,  but the rest of my visits are just as bad. 

The good: (and the only reason I am giving two stars)
-$2 dos xx drafts on Tuesdays.
- DJ on tuesdays. Impressive. Nice music selection.
-Corn hole, if it isnt being hogged all night by the same two people.
 -Taco bar outside on weekends.

The bad:
-Service
-Prices (except dos xx on tues!)
-Food 
-How am I supposed to dance in sand?
-Rude bartenders
-Management (because clearly this is all a result of poor management)
