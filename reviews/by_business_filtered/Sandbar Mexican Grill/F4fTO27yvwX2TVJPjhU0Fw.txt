Went there to for the late games on NFL Sunday with a group of 4. On a bill that should have been in the 150 range (we each had a few drinks and one order of nachos to split), our waitress charged me a whopping $267. She also had the gall to have gratuity included already on the check, even though I was only with 3 other people. They literally tried to steal money from me, and I will never go to this place again. 

I came to find out last night that one of my friends paid his tab on the way out as well. His tab was included on mine.

And as if the stealing money wasn't bad enough, the service was terrible.

On a positive note, the place was a fun place to be. Fun and friendly crowd and a really nice facility. It's a shame they are running a dishonest business, because it's a place I would have started going to for NFL Sundays despite the bad service.
