Y'know, it's Desert Ridge.  I wasn't expecting much, and it delievered.  I hadn't been here yet, it was just after work, I thought I'd try it.  Positive was Nick, my Waiter, VERY cute, friendly, flirty and efficient.  BUT the negatives?  Food blah.  NO CHIPS OR SALSA with the meal.  Decent margarita, but in the WRONG glass.  And super scuzzy clientele -- there is such a thing as TOO casual.  I hope Nick gets a better restaurant gig, he deserves more than this.  This is really a tattoo parlor masquerading as an upscale North Scottsdale cantina.  Nick, go apply at a Scottsdale Quarter restaurant, that's more worthy of your abilities.
