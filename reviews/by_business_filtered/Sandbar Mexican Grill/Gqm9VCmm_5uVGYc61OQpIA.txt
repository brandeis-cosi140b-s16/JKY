I've read other reviews about this place and will agree it is not for everyone's tastes.  The food is slightly above average but you actually get a decent amount of it for the price.  I always prefer to go during happy hour and find the wait staff very friendly and attentive enough.  They can be a little slow during that time due to shift changes and sometimes there is some waitstaff drama (probably because they aren't as busy).

I give them 3 stars because they "are who I thought they were!"  If the DJ is annoying or the bartenders aren't talking to you, maybe go during happy hour and you'll get a different vibe of the place.
