This place sucks , the service is shitty , the food is terrible & and when the bouncers aren't allowing underage girls in at night , they are being cock blockers to the paying customers there to have a good time. Take into account the " dress code " which is only enforced if you are not a " regular " and one must deduce that this place is perfect for Scottsdale because it's packed full of phonies
