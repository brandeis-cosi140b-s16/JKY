Wow! I'm out of words.. I can't express enough what kind of operation they're running there! First I order a drink and give a $100 and get $10 change back on one drink purchase..!! Waitress ignores me in the and acts as if I'm Not there! I had to literally yell out to get her attention and she hands me over my correct change! Then I go to restroom and another bartender spills my drink and they get an attitude about replacing it! Honestly just go there on a busy night and it's chaos! They don't know what they're doing! It's complete pandemonium Management has no control at all!! Just horrible service!!! Never again, good luck!
