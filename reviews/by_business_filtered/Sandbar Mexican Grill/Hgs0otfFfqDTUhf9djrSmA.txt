I hate for my first review to be of this joke of a place.  We have given this place a million tries, and somehow they go from sub par to how-in-the-hell can a place be so mismanaged? Seriously! The bartenders and servers are exempt from this, they are usually right on the ball.  However what kind of complete idiots do they have for managers!?! Wow! We have dumped tons of money into this place (only because it is our only nearby option for football) and get a shitty beer selection, maybe one cider option, and overpriced under poured drinks, and smaller and worse quality food.  Which sadly, we tolerated. 
     But today took the cake.  We arrived before anyone on a Sunday (again, for football) and got ourselves a nice table. Again...like...at 930am.  After enjoying ourselves and watching the game for a few hours they plop a f*n reserved sign on our table and tell us to move. Are you F****** KIDDING ME!!! I had no problem if they said at 930am, oh hey this table needs to be clear at one, you may want to pick another.  BUT OH HELL NO they are not bright enough to provide even the smallest of a heads up until they kicked us out of our table.  And if you know this place on Sundays there is not another table to move to, its packed for NFL.  And the damn kicker? The reserved table we were currently were spending money at sat empty for 2 hours lol! (we know this as we literally stood around bar to finish watching games) So great move Sandbar! Kick paying customers out to make room for no one! haha and our neighbors at the table next to us (with a tab much higher than ours) had the same BS happen to them and were replaced by water drinkers!! The GM Justin was a joke.  Wake up buddy and learn some customer service.  Pretty sure your servers could run that place better.  So don't go here if you want to be treated fairly, they are "still learning" as we were told.  Pretty sure they teach that in kindergarten Justin.
