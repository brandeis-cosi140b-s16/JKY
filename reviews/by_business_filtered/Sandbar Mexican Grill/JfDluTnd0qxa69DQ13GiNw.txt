Does it feel like a casting party for MTV's game show Next when I come here?  Yes, yes it does.  That said, you have to appreciate this joint for what it is: decent food, reasonable drink prices, and entertaining people watching.  I sat with friends for close to 2.5 hours and after tip my tab was just over $10 - that doesn't suck.  Most of the waitresses are nice, and easy on the eyes - so service is consistently average.  They have a plethora of tvs and there is actually sand on the patio, which I guess is kind of unique.  If you're patio bound, you may have to deal with the smokers, but most of them are considerate enough to not be a bother.  Check this place out some time for happy hour - that's your best bet for having a good time.
