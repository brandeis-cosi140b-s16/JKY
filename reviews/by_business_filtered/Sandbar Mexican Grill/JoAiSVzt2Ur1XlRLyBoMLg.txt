The cheese dip was alright.  The bartender was not great.  And why do I feel 80 when I walk in here?  Oh, that's right.  All the "kids" working as staff were born in the 90s!  Plus, the frat guys sitting on the porch and around the bar yelling at the football on the 50 TVs in here probably didn't make me feel any younger.  I suppose if you were born after 1990, you should go here.  If not, don't do it.  You just look older under all those fluorescent lights!
