Seriously, you would think a bar with a cool beachy theme and a nice patio would be a no brainer in Arizona. Sadly, this place has disappointed me. I have been here twice and I'm still unimpressed. Drinks are ok, but I would expect a little more alcohol in my drink- my vodka tonic tasted mostly like tonic. Also, I think I'm generally on the younger side of the crowd here, and I felt slightly out of place. Not trying to offend, and I know its in chandler, but one Saturday night I went, and I swear the average age was 35-40. Its ok for happy hour, but there are certainly better places to go.
