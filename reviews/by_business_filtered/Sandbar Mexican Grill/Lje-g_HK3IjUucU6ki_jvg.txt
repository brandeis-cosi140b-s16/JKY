We went for lunch on a weekday. Was a great experience and food was exactly what we were looking for. Andi, our waitperson was friendly and professional. Haven't had a blended Margarita in years and must say I don't ever remember having one so amazing - ice so fine, flavor not overly sweet nor bitter. We had a lunch special - chicken quesadilla and the portion and price were great. Will return for lunch again.
