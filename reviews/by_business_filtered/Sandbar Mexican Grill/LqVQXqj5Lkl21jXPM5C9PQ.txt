I continue to come here regularly and enjoy my visit each time. I never understand why this place still continues to get so many bad reviews. Our waitress was the sweetest thing and never let me drink go empty. I think I enjoy the change up between the different nights, live music, DJs. My favorite part must be the people watching! Awesome atmosphere every night of the week
