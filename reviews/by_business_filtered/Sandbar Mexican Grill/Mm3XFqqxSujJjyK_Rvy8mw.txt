Known for the atmosphere and fun environment - YOU HAVE TO TRY THE FOOD!!  I love coming to this place for happy hours, birthdays, weekends, etc.   However, last week I came on Saturday for lunch with a group of friends that eat here regularly.  We actually drove from central Scottsdale because they raved about the tacos. Being a Mexican food lover I couldn't wait to try these tacos and I'm super picky.  I ordered the taco platter which comes with three large tacos. My biggest challenge (like always) was deciding which kind to get. I ended up getting a carnitas, chicken and carne asada taco. I figured I'd like one more than the other but each of them was fantastic!  Each had their own special flavor and unique taste. There was nothing bland about it.  The margarita was perfect and the chips and salsa were amazing also. Try both the green and traditional salsa - again I'm picky and I could have eaten 10 servings of this. Everything was amazing. We will be back very soon for lunch and dinner.
