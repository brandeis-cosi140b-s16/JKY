I'm a fan of the Sandbar in Scottsdale. This one in Chandler, seems... Not as service oriented. Last night at happy hour, we waited 20 minutes before the bartender said "I'll be right with you". Later, we moved to a table and I waved the waitress over. She said, "Can I help you with something?". haha. Almost like she was just going to point to the bar and say, "you can get your drinks right there." But then service got normal. I've been to this Sandbar 4 times now. Foods good, drinks are ok.
