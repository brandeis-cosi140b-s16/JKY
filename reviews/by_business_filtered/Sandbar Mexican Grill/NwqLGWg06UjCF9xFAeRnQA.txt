Came in for happy hour and finally decided the jalape√±o macaroni and cheese! Best decision I made all week!! It has just the perfect amount of spice! And service was great as always! Super cheap happy hour, best in town I would say!! They have the misters on, on the patio which makes a huge difference when you want to enjoy the beach atmosphere! They play really good music too!=]
