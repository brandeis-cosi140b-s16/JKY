I hate leaving bad reviews about this bar because the managers here are the greatest !....... But once again, I have brought a group of friends and the service is beyond horrible..... 5 guys, 25 min and still haven't taken out order. Do I look like I can't afford it? Did we not dress nice enough? Do you not work for tips? Every time I come here the service is absolutely horrible!
