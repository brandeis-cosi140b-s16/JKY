I"m reviewing this based on Sunday lunch only since I have not experienced the nightlife here, but it sounds like a pretty happening place on Fri/Sat.  I had lunch here today with a girfriend and thought it would be more crowded in the bar for Sunday football, but it wasn't too packed.  We were hoping to catch up and chat, so the noise level with the music and high def sports made it a little bit challenging, but overall it's a cool atmosphere and has a good vibe.

I ordered the chicken burrito with black beans and rice ($9) and she had the cheese enchiladas with green sauce and rice/beans ($9).  I liked the presentation, both plates were very festive and nicely sized portions.  I ate half of mine and took the rest to go.  It was really good with nice chunks of shredded chicken breast mixed in with a pico de gallo type sauce.

The service was really good, and I'm looking forward to coming back for cocktails :)
