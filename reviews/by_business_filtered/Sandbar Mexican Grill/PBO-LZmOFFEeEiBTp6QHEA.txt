Sandbar is an OK place to go in the daytime when you are having a few drinks, but at night this place gets crazy (which isn't always bad, crazy can be fun)...but not always in a good way. We come here because its close to home and we enjoy the ambiance, but the food is not very good at all. One Friday night we decided to go to Sandbar to have a few drinks and relax, and all of the sudden my foot is bleeding everywhere. There is some crazy girl throwing bottles and drinks at some guy she is pissed off at, and my friends and I have glass all over us and are drenched with sticky alcohol...I go to the bouncer to let him know the situation and that people are getting hurt by this psycho b*&%h and what does he do??? He kicks me out! I try to explain the situation to him but his little bouncer brain doesn't quite get the picture. They never did anything about the girl and my friends and I had to leave. This place is trashy...end of story.
