My husband and I came in and there were about 5 people that came and went from the reception area and we were never acknowledged until they decided to seat us.  So started out not so good.  It got much better though.   Our waitress Jennifer was awesome!  She was very sweet and checked on my husband and I often.  We decided to watch boxing fight and she still came by often to see if we needed more drinks or anything, even if they were full.  Super sweet and I would request her if I came back.  We r from out of town, but will definitley request her next time in town.  Thanks so much Jennifer!!
