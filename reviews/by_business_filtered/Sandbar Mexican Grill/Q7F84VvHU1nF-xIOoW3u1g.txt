The atmosphere, the food/drinks and the staff are excellent. It's a great place for some night life but without the craziness of dealing with Old Town. It's always busy whether it's mid week evening or a Saturday night but not too much that it's overwhelming. Can get pretty loud sometimes on game days. Also, they make a killer margarita! Love, love sandbar!!
