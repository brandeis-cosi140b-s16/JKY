Fun place!! I dont go out but I found myself here a few times, no matter the night the crowd was always good! Everyone from all ages is in this place. The food is bomb, not a big mac and cheese person but the Jalapeno Mac is delicous, and is on their happy hour everyday amongst drinks and other food.
