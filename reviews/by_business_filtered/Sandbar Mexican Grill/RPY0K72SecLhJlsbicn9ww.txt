Taco Tuesday is awesome here! Place is delicious. Great amount of beers as well. The atmosphere is great. Patron bottles as the hanging lights, the colors are great, the bartenders are hot!! Haha the outside seating is on a bank of sand which is pretty cool. Overall I enjoy this place to catch the football game or just to grab a few brews with some friends. Service lacked a little last night but it's a bar... Good bar though.
