Planned to meet a few friends for happy hour after work last night and shortly before I arrived I found out there were going to be at least 12 people. There were no tables outside at all, but there were a couple empty cabanas so I asked the hostess if we could get one. She grabbed Justin who was super helpful and after a quick chat we were seated in the biggest cabana on the patio. Our waitress, Michelle, was attentive and friendly. No one was ever looking for her to refill their drinks. We had a great night and we'll definitely go back more often after the way Justin and Michele took care of us!
