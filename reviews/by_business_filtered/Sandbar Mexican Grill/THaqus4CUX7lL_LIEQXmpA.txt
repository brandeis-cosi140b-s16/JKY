When I lived in Phoenix, this was one of my usual places. I would go here several times a week and have never had a bad experience. The staff has always been super friendly and welcoming. I LOVED their frozen strawberry margaritas and got hooked on their chicken caesar salad w/ buffalo chicken.  I've since moved to Boston and still crave their salad. The outside atmosphere is awesome and they always play great music. Added bonus? They always have a really good happy hour. I miss this place so much!
