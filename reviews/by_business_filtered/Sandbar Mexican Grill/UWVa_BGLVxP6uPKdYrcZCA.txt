I will never go back, unless it is free, and then I will still think twice.  I joined staff from the company I work for at an End of Summer Celebration on 9/6/13 from 3-6PM.  The food was excellent, the atmosphere on the patio was acceptable.  It was still a tad too warm out to be on the patio IMHO.  I asked our very inattentive server for an ice water with my beer when I first got there.  They brought the beer pretty quickly but I had to ask again almost 45 minutes later for the water.  When I ordered a second frothy beverage shortly after finally getting my glass of water, it took forever and they brought me the wrong brand.  (The place wasn't that busy) By that time I was hot, tired, and pissed, so I decided to take the opportunity to go home just before 5PM.  The company was good, but the service sucked beyond words.  It isn't worth the chips and salsa to be virtually ignored, especially when you are there with a moderate sized group.
