Great margaritas! I recommend the frozen strawberry, or the Chambord margarita on the rocks.

Food is your typical mexican bar food, nothing spectacular. Women beware! The sandy floor gets annoying in your shoes! However, it is part of the atmosphere (SAND bar). 

The lines and waiting at this place are absolutely absurd on the weekends. There is a cover for men after 10pm but women are free. The music is good, the atmosphere fun, but if there ends up being a ridiculous wait, you'll find the exact same thing at San Felipes in Desert Ridge.
