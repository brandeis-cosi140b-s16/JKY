Too expensive and usually too crowded. Its fine for once in awhile b/c it does look really nice and all the ppl usually look really nice too. They have really nice and expensive private cabanas. They also have big flat screens and a beach theme (duh). Their stools are pretty uncomfortable and its hard to get a booth. I just don't want to have to get dressed up everytime I go to a bar and pay $10 for a shot. I liked going here for Halloween to see all the funny costumes.
