I'd been meaning to check this place out, since it's in my neighborhood and I like a good Mexican restaurant. 

I was pleasantly surprised. Service was good, the pork adobo tacos were delicious, and the chicken fajitas were also very good. I wanted to try the drinks, but my friend and I had stopped in for lunch while running errands. So I'll save that for another review.
