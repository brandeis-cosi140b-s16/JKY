Went to Sandbar this afternoon. Sat at the bar for at least 10 minutes before the male bartender even acknowledged me. I asked for iced tea and a menu. My grilled mahi tacos were ok but not great, but I never saw the bartender again until I practically had to flag him down for my tab. The service here is so bad. Female bartenders only wait on men who are drinking beer. They don't make eye contact and won't even acknowledge the female patrons. 
Sorry Sandbar, I'm not happy with your service and am sorry I wasted my time there.
