Only nightlife in Desert Ridge Marketplace. PROS: Fun for drinks and people watching, lots of TVs for sports. CONS: Music will make your ears bleed, impossible to hold a conversation. Bathroom attendant- why?! Very awkward. Food, why would you at at a nightclub? I wouldn't, it's kinda grimy. TIPS: Order beer by the bucket. Wisconsin Badger fan bar.
