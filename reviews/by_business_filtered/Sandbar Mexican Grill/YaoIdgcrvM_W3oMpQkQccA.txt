We had a great experience at the Sandbar Mexican Grill up at Desert Ridge. We had a Groupon that expired on 1/29/2012 and decided to go on a Friday night to use right after Happy Hour (7pm) The place was crowded, but we got lucky to find a place right away outside, next to a fireplace. We were also lucky enough to have a GREAT waitress that served us, Paulina M. She was on top of everything and had no issues taking our Groupon which was a $40 value that we purchased for $20. That got us 2 margarita's and 2 entree's. We had some smooth margarita's, the house marg was good as well as the sweet and smoky marg that I had. (Pineapple and chipotle) I had the beef enchiladas which were good. The guacamole that we got with our chips were good as well. Overall - an enjoyable experience! They could have had corn tortillas as an option ;-)
