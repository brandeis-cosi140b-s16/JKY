A buddy and I walked in here on an extremely miserable day in Phoenix (this is of course all relative to Philly, but it was 60 degrees and rainy so not so good) for lunch and our spirits were raised instantly by 2 gorgeous young hostesses who greeted us with big broad grins.  Wow.  Of course the rest of the experience wasn't quite so great but whatever.

The Sandbar obviously caters to a young party crowd at night, there are outdoor couches and a huge bar both outside and in.  A free beer coupon from the Marriott I was staying in gave us a great start!

I expected to have great Mexican in Phoenix for obvious reasons, but this ain't the place to get it.  The dishes were an American and typical interpretation of Mexican.  Nachos loaded with so much crap on top that you could make a meal out of them alone.  I tried the sliders with sweet potato fries, they were passable, but not real Mexican either.

The bartender was extraordinarily friendly in a genuine way, not the forced corporate way which I hate.  (you know the type: and how are we doing today, sir?) Anyways, he was a cool guy.

I wouldn't eat here again, it was average, but I would gladly party later at night.
