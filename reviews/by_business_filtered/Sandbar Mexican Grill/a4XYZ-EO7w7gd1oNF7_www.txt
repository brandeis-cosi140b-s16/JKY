Me and a group of friends went here around 12:30 a.m. after leaving McFadden's on a Saturday. Ladies entered for free. $5 cover for guys.This place was POPPING. The DJ was on point! I stayed on the dance floor the WHOLE time that I was there... shaking my sh!t. lol. The crowd was a mixture of young, old, Caucasian, and Hispanic. ...Unsurprising, not many blacks. Bar service was quick.  Overall, great atmosphere. Everyone was festive!  If you want a place to meet friends, people watch, or dance the night away, this is your place.
