I came in thinking this was a dive, apparently I hadn't don my research nor checked this place out on yelp. I don't know why I was so ill informed but with just a few more minutes left of the Happy Hour (and our waitress told us so we could get one of those sneaky margaritas for a steal)

(I was merely here to check it out, before I plan to bring people here)

I felt I got great service, and that the Happy Hour $4 frozen margaritas is way stronger than expected. I was looking around and contemplating how many people I could bring here and still have a sense of control over my party. It remains to be seen. I did not have any food at this visit. 

This is another place I will have to return to and investigate more thoroughly, but so far it made a good impression.
