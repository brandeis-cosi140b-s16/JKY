So I have driven by this place many times and it always looks packed so I thought I would give it a try. Sat out in the patio where they had misters and good music but that was the best part of my whole experience. I ordered combo tacos which were all cold and lacked flavor. The waitress rarely came to our table and the iced tea was watered down. I will definitely never return to this place.
