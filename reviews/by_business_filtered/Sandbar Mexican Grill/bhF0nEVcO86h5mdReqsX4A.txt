Though I come here often, its not for the food, more so fir the atmosphere. I almost feel like I'm in Mexico (we always sit outside). Though I think the minimum for a cabana is a joke (I believe someone mentioned a $250 min. No wonder why they're typically empty; the one's who pay are probably too drunk to realize the rip off).

Taco Tuesday and Ladies Night on Thursday's are always a hit in my book. Us ladies sit out and laugh for hours. Thursday's is 1/2 off appetizers and drinks all night. I'm usually stuffed so much when I leave that I'm sick (my own fault).

The waitresses are extremely slow. I'm talkingpace. I typically luck up and get Amanda if she's there (she's a super star!). Anyone else and the service is horrible.
