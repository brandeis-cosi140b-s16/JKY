I know most people come here to grab a drink before heading out for the night, I never have so can't comment on that, but I am a big fan of their taco Tuesdays. For $2 a taco they have a great selection that will appeal to anyone. And of course it includes bottomless chips and salsa, you will find me here most Tuesdays.
