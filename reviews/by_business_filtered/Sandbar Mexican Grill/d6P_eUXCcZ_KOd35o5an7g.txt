Sandbar in Desert Ridge is a great bar / restaurant in Scottsdale. They have a good variety of drinks, their food is delicious, and their service is really top notch. 

Try their chicken / steak burritos and barbecue burger. 
Burger lovers will love the tastiness and freshness of the meat and the optional potato wedges.

Drinks are pretty well priced for a Scottsdale establishment. The bartenders are also pretty well versed in making exotic and rare drinks.
