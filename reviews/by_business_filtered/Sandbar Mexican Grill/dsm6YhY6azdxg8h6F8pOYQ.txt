Sandbar has some decent prices but beware. If you order a margarita, you'll get a bonus serving of heartburn for your value price. There is so much sweet and sour in them that they embarrass authentic Mexican restaurants. 

On the weekends, at 10pm, a small end of Sandbar turns into a dance floor with a cheesy island photo lit up as the background. The DJ is terrible because he plays about 20 seconds of each song and then trainwrecks right into the next one. I think that the game is to see how many tunes he can crank out in one session as opposed to getting people to dance. 

The outside patio is pretty nice. TVs are visible from most seats and the sand is a nice touch. There is even a projection screen at one end that they lower when the sun goes down. There are also heating lamps for the chilly nights. However, if you sit outside - flirt with your server so they think you care and will pay attention to you - or else you'll be waiting 30 min intervals until you see your server again. 

Guacamole is decent; good place to watch sports...   :)

Cheers!
