I will never visit this establishment again. We went for my brothers birthday and rented the large cabana. The major problem was our lack of service, and the service we did get was horrible. We were given one waitress for our large party. She might have been able to keep up if she remembered she was a waitress and not a socialite. It would take over a half an hour for her to come get our orders, and once she did, she would take another half hour to deliver them and sometimes she would just straight up forget your order all together. We also noticed we had drinks added to our order that we didn't order. The only time the waitress had a smile was when we were closing our tab and she tried to give her meager attempt at an apology for being a crappy waitress. I am always a big tipper since I worked in the service industry, but this time I just couldn't give her a tip, the service was so horrible that it was the first time in years I gave no tip. But that didn't stop her from getting one. She felt she would add a tip herself. We didn't realize this until we saw our bank statement and she added a $14 tip for herself. We are currently in the process of disputing the charge. Also we found out from several of the other people that went that they double charged anyone who paid cash. They charged the card used to hold the tab and then took the cash they used to actually pay it. My family and friends will never recommend or go to this joke of an establishment ever again!
