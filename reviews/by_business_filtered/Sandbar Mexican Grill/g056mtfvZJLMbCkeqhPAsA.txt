Meant to do this a while ago, but forgot.  Went with family of 4. Not young kids, but teenagers.  Food was ok, but it took us a long time to get seated and it's just WAY TOO LOUD!  We joked the entire time, how this place is like a "meat market!"  Definitely NOT a family place to dine.  The entertainment was watching people get "hit on!"  Not my cup of tea but I suppose, if I were younger and single, it might be a fun place.  Just not for a family, at all!
