Went here on a Saturday night.  Got there around 9 anticipating it being crowded and wanted to get a table.  We got the LAST table, smack in the center of the room.  No ideal but great for people watching.

Very eclectic group of people, mostly 25 and older with a very casual atmosphere.

Didn't eat here but the drinks were watered down and overpriced.  Typical bar.

Good music, definitely geared towards the older crowd as it was mostly 90's and early 2000's hip hop which was fun.  

Great for people watching and the girl to guy ratio is easily 2.5:1
