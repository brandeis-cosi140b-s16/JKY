Okay for Fridays after work and Saturday nights are pretty live (drinking).  But catch them under the tent in the sand on an average day and service is a bit slow portions are small and I guess your paying for those skimpy waitress outfits.  I was not impressed after our last family visit there as I was still hungry after I left.  3 fish taco meal was just that 3 dressed fish tacos my kid paid extra for 3 plain fish tacos (add cheese).  Gonna put them on the back burner till I try them again.
