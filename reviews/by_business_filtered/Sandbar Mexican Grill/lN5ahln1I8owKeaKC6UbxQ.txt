Sand Bar was pretty pricey but it was a lot of fun. They were playing perfect music to dance to and the drinks were consistently made and tasted well. Can't speak on the food, as we did not go there to eat. But the whole vibe was just what we were looking for, for our night of fun.
There wasn't a cover the night we went, and if there was, I would be asking why!? (Just read a previous review)
And when you leave, make sure to be ready to say goodbye to the officers standing at the doorway. They must get a LOT of DUI's leaving from this place.
Anyway, I will definitely be going there again. Liked the crowd.
