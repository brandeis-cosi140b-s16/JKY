I mentally gave this place 4 stars the first time I came here.. mostly because I got plastered and proceeded to taste my food twice for the rest of the next day. 

I then came back during day time to eat. Not my choice, but hey, can't pick where those office lunches happen. The food was pretty MEH.. my vegetarian friends were pretty disappointed when they saw the veggie tacos (they don't even use tortilla shells, they use jicama which is soft and WET). nothing special.. you can get better Mexican at Taco Bell. 

Side note about Sandbar... the staff (waitresses/bartedners,etc) are all very hot.. but that guido-style attire with really tight tshirts, massive amounts of gel in your hair and bad-boy attitude doesn't really make me love to look at you.. I'm just sayin'
