This place is not a Mexican Grill--it's a bar that also serves food. It's shines as a nightspot and comes to life on Friday and Saturday. Save your time and money for a little -- or a lot -- of drinking. 

Don't go on Thursday nights unless you like terrible "throwback" music. It's like random old school hip-hop/rap songs and the DJ always cuts the tracks and odd times.

The drinks here are pricey but they are generous with alcohol. They throw you a bone with $2 street tacos which are insanely delicious. 

Outdoor patio is a smoker's delight and is as big as the main restaurant. Two full bars with flat screens surround the bar. 

Weekend are fun: it's packed by 10:00PM and people dance in this section of the dining room they push tables out of the way. Yeah...not a club but hey, it works. I've done the Cupid Shuffle many, many times.

During the weekday it's busy but not crowded. Music always comes on around 10:00PM.

And curiously enough there is always a sketchy cab monopoly. It used to be VIP Taxi and now I don't know what it is but it doesn't look good. 

Super casual and fun. But it is kind of out of the way and there is no food around that's open besides In & Out. 

I think the cover is $10 for guys. Ladies are in free.
