Went to Sandbar on Sat. specifically because their website advertised happy hour from noon - 7:00pm.  When we asked our waitress about it she indicated the Sat. happy hour had been discontinued since Aug.  After 4 months they should have been able to update their website.  At this point it is becoming a case of false advertising!
