I went here with my fianc√©e and a group of friends on Saturday night. We were looking for some nightlife and sand bar absolutely qualified. Loud music, dancing, a building packed with bodies and a late night taco station. The sand bar, beach theme was cool. I was actually suprised it seemed like a place that could be good during the day time as well. Not a bad choice for that side of town. 
Did I mention taco cart? Who doesn't like drunk-tacos??
