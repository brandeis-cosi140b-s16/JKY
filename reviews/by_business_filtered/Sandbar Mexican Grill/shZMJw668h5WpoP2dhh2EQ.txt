Really great place for people of any age group! I do like the music played here and it is near to a variety of restaurants. So grab some buds, get some food and then head to the sandbar to grab a drink, dance, and act the fool :) Drinks are pretty affordable although, I seemed to manage to get others to pay for my drinks. I may have talked to a few guys but, at the end of the night it's not really a place that you will meet the man of your dreams. More likely to meet students and people out to have fun.
