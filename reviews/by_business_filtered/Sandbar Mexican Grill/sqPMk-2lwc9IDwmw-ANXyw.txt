We went here recently for a friends birthday.

They had rented a cabana, so we didnt have to fight w/ the crowd  or to get a table which was nice. The cabana was spacious and relatively cool because of the misters. Our waitress was surprisingly attentive, yet unenthusiastic. She kept forgetting our DDs drinks. And the drinks were average.

The only real complaint we had is that they kept turning of the misters to the cabanas making it unbearably hot. The misters stayed on the rest of the patio, just not the area where people paid extra to sit, which just seemed wrong to me.
