Went here with a some friends for drinks around happy hour time. With the weather being really nice out, we liked the open restaurant concept--we could feel the cool breeze coming inside. I found myself watching the last bits of a nba game.. on one of 30 flat panel screens! Each table inside had a great view to nearby tv. I would love to come back for football games! We ordered off happy hour menu--$5 margs and $3 draft beers. We also had some chips and guac. The bucket of chips they plumped down was huge and the guac had nice big chunks of avocado. Between the 3 of us, we didn't feel hungry enough to order dinner after! After 9 or 10 this place turns into full on bar and sometimes there is a cover for guys. That's probably the only knock I have..
