Their Ancho Ribs are SOO good.  Thursdays are their ladies day so appetizers & drinks are half off for the ladies all day... who can beat that?  5 dollars for Ancho Ribs.  YESS.

They always have a lot of great craft beers on draft so that makes me happy.

We've watched a couple of games here... I don't know... it doesn't really feel like a place to watch the game.  Maybe because the sound wasn't on?  The crowd is always pretty mixed...  i can't really figure this place out.

I definitely saw a strip of bacon in a bloody mary the last time I was here so that's a definite plus.
