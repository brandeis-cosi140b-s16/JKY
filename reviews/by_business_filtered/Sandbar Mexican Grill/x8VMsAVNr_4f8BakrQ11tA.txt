The only thing good I can say about this place is that they have good entertainment. Went there just to see the band and will never go back. It was $20 for guys and $10 for girls, just to get In

I should have gone with my gut and left before going in. 

When we were finally able to order a drink, 20 min. After we sat down, our waitress asked us if we wanted to start a tab? I was not planning on staying long so I said I would pay cash. I had to pre-pay, and that is fine. I am sure when it is busy they have issues, so I paid her, $19 for 2 Coronas & 1 shot of tequila??? Way over priced in my opinion.  We waited 20 more min. Still no drinks so my friend went looking for the waitress, couldn't find her. 40 min after we ordered, I see our waitress just walking around???? I asked her about our drinks, she tells me we shouldn't have moved??? We were at the same table, but whatever, I wanted the change from my $100, she had to go get it and I said I would follow her, I didn't want her to lose me again. She got my change and was so rude about giving it to me! I didn't complaine about paying for drinks that we never got so why is she mad????? 

I guess the manager is too busy "rapping on stage" to actually manage his employees's?? He was pretty good at rap, maybe he should stick to that because he sucks at running a bar!
