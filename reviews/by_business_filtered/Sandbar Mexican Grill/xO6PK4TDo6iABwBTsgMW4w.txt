When you go to a restaurant, you expect that you will be charged properly. I came here with a friend at midnight for the last couple hours of Cinco de mayo. I ordered 2 drinks (one for me and one for my friend). I paid my bill with my card and left a cash tip. Today I check my bank account and see that not only was I charged twice, but I was charged 2 different amounts. Now my account has been blocked and I somehow can't get a hold of the restaurant. They will never again get my patronage. Ridiculous.
