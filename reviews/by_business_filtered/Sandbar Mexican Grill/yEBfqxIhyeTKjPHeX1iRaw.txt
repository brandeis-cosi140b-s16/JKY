Okay so maybe I'm biased because I really hate douche's and high prices for my BEER. But here we go...

I live on the north west side of town (arrowhead). So i'm closer to the other Sandbar on northern and the 101, that place is pretty hood, and this sand bar is the complete opposite...but i digress.

A friend was moving back to jersey and she wanted to meet here for drinks. I got here around 10pm on a Friday night. It was extremely packed, but I found parking, no biggie. I did like how they have a lot of taxi's lined up at the front door just encase you might need one, which I love because I cab it everywhere when I'm consuming alcohol.  
No line yet at the door, I get right in with some friends. We get a table, high top somewhere. I will admit, there are some smokin hot ladies in here, and some cute cougars as well. Funny thing is, these chicks all have high heels on and when they are walking in the sand, I was hoping i'd see at least 1 eat shit. Didn't happen, then again I didn't sty long. 

The atmosphere here is a typical Scottsdale douche bag bar/club. A lot of guys wanted to bang some hot girl, and a lot of hot girls looking pretty yet it's pretty obvious that they have ZERO personality.

I went to the bar to get my and my friend a beer. "2 Coronas please", okay, that will be $10!. Uh what the fuck did you just say to me, I asked for 2 coronas and you're telling me it's $10 for 2 fucking beers. I literally paid because I wanted a drink, hung out for a little then took off. 

The over all douche bag aroma, mixed in with the high prices for a beer turned me the hell off. I'll stay on the west side, or any non douche establishment around town and wont ever come back to this place.
