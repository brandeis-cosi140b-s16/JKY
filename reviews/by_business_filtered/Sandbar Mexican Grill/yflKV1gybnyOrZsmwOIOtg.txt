I came for lunch last week and they have really good specials, not too crowded and good service.  Great place for taco Tuesday or happy hour pretty much any day. Casual chill yet fun vibe early but come a little later for more of a party vibe. Its worth checkin out if your in the area and remember... Tequila makes her clothes fall off.
