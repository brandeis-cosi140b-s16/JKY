I purchased a groupon to try out this place.  The first time I went, it was happy hour and our waitress said our groupon wouldn't be eligible for happy hour prices.  That was okay by myself and my husband and we decided to use our groupon another day.  The drinks were watery, but the appetizers were very good.  We were excited to come back and use our groupon.  Our 2nd visit was at the end of happy hour.  We ordered off the menu and informed our waitress that we had the groupon.  She asked us if we wanted any drinks.  I asked if it was ok, since we were using a groupon.  She assured us it was ok.  Our food arrived and we had a total of 2 drinks.  When we requested the check, our waitress informed us that we could only use $12.00 of the $20.00 groupon...(I had paid $10.00, so this wasn't much of a deal).  My husband suggested to seperate the checks and pay cash for the drinks, we were told that wouldn't be allowed.  Get the $12.00 discount or pay for the entire bill.  We decided to use the groupon another day and pay the check.  We were not happy.  Very poor customer service, especially since we tried to cover all our bases and the waitress made the mistake.  BEWARE GROUPON USERS!!!!   The only reason we are going back is to finally be able to use our groupon.  We WILL NOT be purchasing any alcohol, appetizers or desserts....just the entrees and water.  My husband works with a well known computer company and he is letting any and all know about the poor customer service at this place and to not use them for corporate events.
