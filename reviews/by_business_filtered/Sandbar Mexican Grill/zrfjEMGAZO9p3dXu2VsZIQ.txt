I went in this past Saturday to watch the fight and the soccer games. We got the last seat at the bar, it was very busy. We were greeted faster than I expected and got drinks right away! I tried the Mr. Pineapple on draft and it was delicious! Appetizer came out quick and we loved our entrees. We tried the Baja tacos and steak fajitas and loved them! Throughout all the games and the fight we received great service! We never had an empty beer or water! And happy hour is super cheap! The environment is very relaxing and a chill place to go on the weekends!
