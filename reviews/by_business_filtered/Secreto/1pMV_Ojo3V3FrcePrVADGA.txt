Being from New Mexico, Mexican food is in my DNA. This place was horrible. I ordered the chicken fajitas and they looked like a piece of rubber, or if it was warmed up in the microwave and tasted the way it looks. This is NOT new mexican food! I also don't like the cheesy names on the menu like the Roswell burrito or the carlsbad enchiladas, really?
