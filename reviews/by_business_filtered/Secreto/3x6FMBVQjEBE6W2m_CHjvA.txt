Went to the "soft opening" at Secreto.  (chandler and 42nd st)  The food was great.  I had the Steak and my wife had the Carne Adovada.  Fantastic food, great copper bar, great appetizers.  True New Mexico food here in the valley.  They have a great wine list and I think this will become my new must have once a week hangout.
