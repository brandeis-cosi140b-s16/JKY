The first time my boyfriend and I came here was a few months ago, we went on a taco Tuesday and the place was busy and ended up waiting over an hour for our tacos until we decided to pay for our drinks and go somewhere else. We decided to try it once again cuz I felt possibly they had a secret and the only secret is crap! They tacos were bland if u must try them then go for the tilapia. Servers stood around complaining with bad looks on there face and talked to the owner at the front door for 15 minutes while we waited to pay. Would never come here again
