Secreto was a nice change of pace for date-night for my wife and I because there is not really another place in the area that is like it.  I agree with a previous review - it's not really mexican cuisine - more like southwest with a mediterranean presentation.  

The ambience is higher-end for dinner, but it was so dark in our booth that I felt like I was playing a "guess the food" game as I plucked chunks of unidentifiable vegetables (some turned out to be fruit!) out of the medley on my plate.  I realize some people like the dark candle-light ambiance, but I prefer to have a clear view of what I'm about to eat.  They also could use a better wine selection.  

Overall though,  it was a really enjoyable experience and I am glad to have a restaurant like this in the area.
