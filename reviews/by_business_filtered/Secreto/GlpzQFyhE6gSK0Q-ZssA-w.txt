I wish this place had been kept a secret! I took my brother here for lunch  on recommendation from the reviews.  

Problem one:  at around 11:40 there was no one else in the place (a sign I usually don't ignore and take my leave as well). 

Problem two:  our server (female, young, blonde) after taking our menus asked if we would like chips and salsa.  We obliged only to find out THAT THEY ARE ABOUT 4 DOLLARS to which we were charged!  Again, I would usually complain and refuse to pay but my brother preferred to just let it slide.  

Problem three:   I asked for a straw and the same server brought an un-wrapped straw to me bare-handed and placed it in my drink for me.  That is just poor on every level.

Problem four:  I ordered the smothered burrito. Appearance-wise, it looked like vomit.  Once you get past that you may in fact be eating regurgitated slop, it simply was just below average especially for the price of roughly 9 dollars for a lunch special.

Overall, a place to avoid.  I will be impressed if the combination of quality, service, location, taste, etc. lends itself to a successful model that lasts through the year.

If you still decide to try this place, at least head somewhere else like Frank and Lupe's in Scottsdale soon after so you can make an honest comparison to real quality.
