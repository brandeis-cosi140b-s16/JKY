I had dinner here recently my husband and we both really enjoyed it. The food was tasty and slightly spicy. The atmosphere was a refreshing change, candles and private booths with pillows. 
Wonderful place for a date night dinner. 
Our server was very attentive to our every need. 
No waiting for a table either. Help this business stay in business, go try a sangria.
