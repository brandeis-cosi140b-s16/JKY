Tried the place twice as the menu seems creative and well thought out. But they are 2 for 2 in delivering mediocre food at best. Our server was very nice but it was quite obvious she had little to no training or experience. The owner claims to be in the food wholesale industry outside of her restaurant. But I think it's safe to say  watching it being done is no replacement for proper training and experience.
