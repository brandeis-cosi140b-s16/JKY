This was our first visit here - the location was convenient and we decided to check it out for an 8pm'ish dinner.  The waitstaff was very prompt and friendly.  He was always checking on us and had helpful suggestions on the dishes (hottest).  The ambiance was delightful - it felt very private and the candles and general New Mexican theme was spot on.

Chips and salsa - the salsa - especially the green was lovely.  The red salsa had far too many tomatoes but had some nice kick to it.  Main dishes: Carne Adovada and Green Chile Stew...the feedback was that the carne was BBQ-y infused with red chile and too dry.  Sadly, didn't live up to expectations.  The green chile stew was very mild and wasn't the kind of quality I had expected - almost like stew out of a can with some flour and green chile added.  I will say the portions are huge, but since I don't eat that much anyway, that wasn't an added bonus for me.
