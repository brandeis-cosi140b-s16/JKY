After a couple of friend's recommendations my wife and I had the pleasure of visiting Secreto for the first time. Secreto certainly lives up to it's name and has to be one of Ahwatukee's best kept "secrets". The atmosphere, service and most importantly, the food, were outstanding. 

My wife had a combination tamale dish while I had a pork dish, one of the best I have ever had. The portions and prices were very reasonable for what you could expect of a restaurant of this caliber. We especially enjoyed the atmosphere with the private booths with cushioned seating and pillows- a nice touch!

We certainly are looking forward to our next return visit to Secreto!
