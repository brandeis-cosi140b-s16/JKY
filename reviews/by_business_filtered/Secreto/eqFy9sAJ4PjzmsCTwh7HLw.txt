went to early lunch..started w/the salsa and chips (green and red) , really
fresh..  on to the beef (which was melt in mouth tenderloin) burrito, great rice and beans. too much to eat.. lunch friend got the beef tenderloin quesadilla w/chipotle sauce which was really good.
Our waitresss was friendly and attentive. Nice place to eat.
