Today I was referred to Secreto from a friend, went for lunch and was blown away on the quality of food and the originality of the dishes. No bowl of Chips here; Secreto is a Southwestern food mecca.  Good for quiet dining, fantastic food and great servers and Management! 
 I had the Pasta Special which had Chili Lime Pasta, perfectly cooked tossed in a Garlic Chili sauce which was spicy but not over powering.  The Shrimp and peppers were not Soggy, they were also cooked to perfection.  Can't wait for a return visit to see what their other meals are like, Too Bad the atmosphere was so nice, I would recommend this place to Guy Fieri to put on DDD. :-)
