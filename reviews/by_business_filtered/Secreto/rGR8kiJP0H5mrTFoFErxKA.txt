Vegetarians not welcome. 

We used to go to Havana when it was in this location. It was my favorite restaurant - just thinking about the berenjena con garbanzos still makes my mouth water. We live nearby so thought we'd give the new place a chance. We went in and looked at the menu with the hostess watching us like a hawk. Disappointed, I asked "do you have anything vegetarian things on the menu?" (for some reason beyond my comprehension, some restaurants like to keep this a secret).

She said to me, "we don't do vegetarian here." 

I just looked at the new menu and they now have cheese enchiladas. WOW, thanks for throwing us a bone.
