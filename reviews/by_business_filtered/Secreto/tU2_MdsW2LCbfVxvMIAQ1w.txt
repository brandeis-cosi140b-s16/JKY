Soooooooo......
I want to first start off by saying that the service was very good. Attentive and apologetic. And they offered to give us dessert on the house. Let me explain: we were super excited about trying a new place and based off of the yelp reviews this seemed like a slam dunk. The listing states that it is a quiet and intimate place. Not so. The music, while good, was really loud and the people drinking in the bar must have been mic'd because they were as loud as hell. One lady in particular favored the donkey style of laughter every ten minutes or so. That's fine, truly, it doesn't bother me. Neither does the fact that we waited over half an hour for our food to be served only to have it be wrong and returned. This was sadly due to a computer that must have been hungrier than us because it decided to eat all the orders. I'm a very patient person and, barring someone trying to punch me in the face, I don't get upset quickly. Such was the case here. My sister on the other hand....not so much. She was about ready to flip the table and go monkey fudge on the kitchen staff. But I digress, what bothered me most of all was the complete blandness of the food. All of it. Not only was it lukewarm, it really had no taste. And the "4 chili hot" red sauce tasted like warmed ketchup. When we asked the waitress if they had any hot sauce, she didn't understand what we meant. She seemed completely baffled that we wanted something with a little flavor. We were very disappointed, but, because the wait staff was very nice I would have no problem giving them another chance. My sister....not so much.
