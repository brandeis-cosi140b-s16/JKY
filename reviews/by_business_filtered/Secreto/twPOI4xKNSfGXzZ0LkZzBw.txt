Nice ambiance, nice selection and variety on the menu.  I don't mind paying $4 for Fresh Homemade Chips with very fresh homemade salsa, just like any other appetizer.  Totally Worth It!  Yum.

Tried the chile rellenos and enjoyed their take on it, kind of a smoky flavor but nice plump chile.  No complaints here.

Service was a bit slow and it took too long to get the check but at least they weren't trying to hustle us out of the table! 

My only COMMENT would be that as a first-time customer I didn't really understand their set-up so a brief mention of the Specials (which I couldn't see from a seated position) would have been helpful.  

Would definitely return to sample other items from the menu.  Food tasted fresh!  We have to support LOCALLY Owned businesses or face a future with only corporate chains!
