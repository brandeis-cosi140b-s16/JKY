It's true. 100% Richardson's knockoff. The amazing thing is that they pulled it off with the food. It was great....my filet was tremendous...not as good as the real thing in environment and the food was maybe a quarter notch below the original...but great and worth regular visits. They even copied the beer cooler w/ ice at the bar.
