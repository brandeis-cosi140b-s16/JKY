I was excited to try this place and with all the good reviews I knew it would be good. I was wrong.
I do have to say that the beans and the salsa bar were amazing, the rest of it not so much. I had 2 tacos, one grilled chicken and the other one steak. The chicken had no flavor at all, there might as well been no meat on it for what it tasted like. The steak was slightly better but the texture of the beef was more like pot roast than steak.
The service could of been better. I felt like I was a bother to the cashier and when I was giving my order I was interrupted by them asking me if my order was for here or to go. Also the price is kind of high for the quality of the food. I really wanted to like this place but I doubt that I will ever go back.
