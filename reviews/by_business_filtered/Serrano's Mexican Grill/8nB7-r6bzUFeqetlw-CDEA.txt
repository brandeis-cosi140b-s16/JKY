I am addicted to the tortilla soup! I'm normally not a soup person, especially when it's 80 degrees outside, but this soup is muy delicioso! I've eaten it three times this week already!  Can't really comment on the rest of the food since this is all I order and it's filling enough that I don't need anything else. My friend ordered the shrimp tacos and said they were really good and some lady across from us had this cheesy, dip looking thing that looked amazing.
