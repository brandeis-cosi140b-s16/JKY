This is my second time here. The first time I had a burrito and a taco. Both very good. This time I'm trying the Cuban sandwich (Torta) and a chicken taco. I expect deliciousness!! And like many reviewers said, the salsa bar is very good and diverse. Support this place! It's WAY better than the junky Mexican food next door!!
