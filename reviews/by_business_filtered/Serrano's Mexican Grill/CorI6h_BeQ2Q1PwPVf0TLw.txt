So far I've yet to be disappointed with this place. Provides a small menu but a good selection of food.
The quality is very good an extremely tasteful.  They have a very good selection of hot sauces go with your  entrees and homemade chips.  
Everything here is made fresh. So you get that fresh taste of the food they do tell that it will take up to 15 minutes to cook and prepare your food so be prepared but being fresh it is well worth it.
  As long as place keeps up its quality and its freshness of the food and  the place will become very popular it's very hard to find a place you can make good food such as here that is good feeling and you walk away full and satisfied.
