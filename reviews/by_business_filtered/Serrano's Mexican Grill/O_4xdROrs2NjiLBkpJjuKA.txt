My family and I saw this place and decided to try it out. Very cute on the inside although it does not seem like it at first when you drive up. I had the enchiladas suizas which were very flavorful. My daughter had shrimp tacos and my honey had a sad tacos. My daughter liked her tacos and honey really liked the Asada tacos. The beans were good but the rice could have used a little more flavor.
