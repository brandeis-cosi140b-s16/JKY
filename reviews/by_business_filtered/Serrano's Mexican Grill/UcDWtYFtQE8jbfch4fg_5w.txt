Stopped in for lunch and had the Mucho Macho steak dinner and a fountain drink.  The food came out quickly and was very tasty!  It's not "fast food" but it was quick.  They have real silverware and not plastic utensils, which is a nice touch.  Based on this first trip, I would highly recommend eating here.
