After reading the reviews on yelp we decided to go to Soriano's and we got there it look like the chain restaurant and we where undecided on whether we want to go in We were pleasantly surprised on how authentic and good the food was. I got the chicken enchiladas Verde and my wife got the chicken enchiladas red sauce both were awesome and any place that serves habanero peppers is all right with me. They also have a really great selection of salsa and hot sauce. The people that work there are very nice.
