Thought I'd try this and here's my opinion. When you first walk in hold your nose. Seems they have been having issues with the women's restroom. It smells awful and hope they fix it soon.
This used to be a fast food restaurant and it still has that feel. The decor could of had a little more imagination.
The food. I ordered enchiladas and it was supposed to be different from the traditional. It wasnt chicken suiza. It looked and tasted like the traditional which was made with tomatillo sauce.
The up however, their salsa bar kicked some booty! I'd just go back for that. Maybe they had a bad day but I don't think I'd go out of my way to eat here. It would not be my first choice. Food was so-so, service was good but they have some room for improvement.
