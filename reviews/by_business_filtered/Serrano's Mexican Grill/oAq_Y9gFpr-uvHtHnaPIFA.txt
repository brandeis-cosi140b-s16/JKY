Went here after driving by and then seeing a groupon. We ordered the enchiladas and the southwest egg rolls. While everything was fine, it was mediocre and unmemorable.   Not sure what kind of Mexican it was supposed to be. It had an odd flavoring that I didn't like or dislike. I did like the salsa bar, but not enough to go back. Plus chips were not included with your meal.
