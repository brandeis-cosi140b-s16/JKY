PASS!

Why is the food here so gosh darn awful?! Such a prime location with great views of the strip yet they can't give you a decent meal. Tsk tsk! Especially at these ridiculous prices! My girlfriends came here for happy hour which is between 3-6pm. No food specials but their souvenir cup drinks are buy one get one free. So roughly a yard would be anywhere between $10-$15 for one during hh. 

We shared an order of chicken quesadilla, steak nachos and sliders. Chicken quesadilla was good. Nice pieces of grilled chicken but for some reason it was hard keeping it together. Not for the lack of cheese but whatever cheese they used didn't melt that well to glue the tortilla together. Steak nachos were awful! Hardly any steak and nothing about it would make me want to order it again. How can you mess up nachos? So easy!! Sliders were awful! Dry dry dry! The buns were so hard they were inedible. We really should have sent it back come to think of it. The patty looked like something that came out of the microwave. Are you serious? 

Senor Frogs has so much potential! Such a cute theme and nice fun restaurant. Would be a great place to day drink and have a shareable meal, unfortunately it is just all crap. If you're looking for a fun day time place to lunch on the strip, I'd go to Diablos at the Monte Carlo instead. 

And what's up with their servers/bussers?! You can't promote a young hip restaurant when every is older than my momma!

Tourist trap!! Take my advice and don't be a sucker!
