Never again....

Apparently, in Treasure Island, they charge double the tax of Nevada because of unknown reasons. The manager explained that it was just the policy of the casino. The food is overpriced and it was not worth the money paid. My wife ordered the grilled chicken, hoping that it would be healthy and delicious. Instead we got a piece of chicken that is not seasoned. Anyone with a frying pan would be able to cook that same meal. We were expecting more. It also came with a  side of horrendous cole slaw. My wife loves cole slaw and she took only one bite of it. BUT on the upside, the fries were good. 
Ernest our was waiter was polite and attentive.
