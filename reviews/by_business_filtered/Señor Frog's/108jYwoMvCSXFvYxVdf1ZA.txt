I rated their Myrtle Beach location as 2 stars but this place gets an extra 1 for the service, people-watching opportunities, and location.

We ate here for dinner because my friends wanted to check it out. The night we went was mostly dead because I think it was a Wednesday. The food was good but nothing to write home about.

We already tried The Yard in Myrtle Beach so we stuck to water. Eventually we reminded ourselves that we were in Las Vegas and needed to man up so we searched for the shot girl we saw walking around earlier. She was nowhere to be found and we had to flag down our waiter, who brought over a round. What he brought were these mixed shots/shooters, which were tasty, but there was definitely not much alcohol in it. So much for manning up. We got another round just because and then the waiter gave us the next two rounds after that for free. I would not have gotten more otherwise because it simply wasn't worth paying for. Our waiter was very nice, attentive, and able to keep conversation. Even his awkward flirting was entertaining.

While all this was going on, we were watching a group of British men being aggressively accosted by a birthday girl and her friends in the bar area and dance floor. The guys were visibly uncomfortable but they all left together so I guess that turned out okay. We had to sit through a few cover songs by a cheesy, awful band. Thankfully we got there as their set was finishing up. A little later all the servers got up on stage to do some type of line dance which was fun to watch.

I think the prices were about the same as they were in Myrtle Beach, but this time around I wasn't sticker-shocked. This is probably due to the fact that I already experienced Senor Frog's before and/or was used to paying Vegas prices.
