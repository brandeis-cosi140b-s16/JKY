What the heck happened to Senior Frogs??? I recently went during Memorial Day weekend and was excited to take my friends!! The food was meh but I could've lived with that seeing that most people only go for drinks -- however the drinks were awful!!!!! We all had yards and not one person tasted any liquor. I'll definitely got to Cabo Wabo instead!
