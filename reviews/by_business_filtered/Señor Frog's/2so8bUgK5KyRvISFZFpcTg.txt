I finally visited Senor Frog's after spending my whole life seeing it as THE place to visit in Cancun while on Spring Break.  I expected to pay a premium on food because of the location on the strip so I hoped the food would deliver.

I ordered a BBQ chicken wrap after the server said they are huge.  What I got was not huge, but I figured whatever, this is no Hash House A Go Go! :)  I don't know if the wrap was supposed to be warm or cold, because different parts were warm (like the chicken), but the lettuce and sauce was ice cold.  Also as I got to both ends of my half-cut wrap, the end was just a ton of sauce with no chicken, not really the best way to end the meal.

On the other hand the fries and chips and salsa were really good, so that was a plus. (I believe we had to pay for the chips though)

I don't have much of a reason to come back here, I can get a bigger and better sandwich somewhere else for half the price.  I'm sure you can do worse, but you can do a lot better on the strip for the same price point.
