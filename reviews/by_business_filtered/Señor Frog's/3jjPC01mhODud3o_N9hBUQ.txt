We were able to get a Groupon for a pretty good deal so we figured we'd try it out.  I had read the reviews but I still always try to go in with an open mind.  Unfortunately, this place lived up to its reputation.  
We went on a Wednesday night, which is notoriously slow here in Vegas.  Even though they weren't crowded, we still had to wait about 20 minutes to be seated.  We did end up being seated outside, which was nice. However, they were doing karaoke and during the karaoke sets the speakers were almost too loud. 
Onto the service, it was just poor.  We waited another 20 minutes before anyone came over, and even then we had to ask for a server.  Our server walked by numerous times prior to us asking and not once did he greet us, or acknowledge us in any way.  
Onto to food, I ordered the fajitas and the BF ordered a burrito.  Again, took a long time for the food to come out.  The food was just so-so.  I got the combination fajitas but I wish I just got the chicken, the beef was chewy and fatty.  The fajitas did have good flavor though.  The rice and beans tasted like something you'd get with a TV dinner.  His burrito was OK, but the chips that came with it were stale.  
I suppose if you were drinking the experience may be slightly better. But, there's plenty of other places on the strip with the same kind of party atmosphere with better food and better service. All in all it was pretty disappointing and I wouldn't recommend it, nor will we go back.
