Probably willing to give a few more stars but the very unfriendly bartender Jamal left us with a bad taste in our mouth.   Being a guest at other Señor Frogs we have never been disappointed, but this gentleman seemed to take his job as just that, a job.   Unhappy to be there perhaps.   At a place like Señor Frogs where atmosphere is everything, he perhaps would have been utilized better in a kitchen with no customer interaction then working a job where tips are part of his pay.
