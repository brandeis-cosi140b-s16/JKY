It all started when I purchased a groupon, 2 yard drinks for $35. So my girlfriend and I decided to have lunch here. Arriving there the girls in the front were having a conversation and totally ignored us when we were STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT, we caught their attention & asked for a table for 2. We had 2 different servers a guy and a girl. The guy kept forgetting what drinks we wanted & kept coming to our table to ask. He took my phone to redeem the groupon & didn't bring it back. When we finally asked for it (after 20 minutes) he didn't even know where it was. The food was HORRIBLE, $20 for a COLD burrito & $20 for a COLD quesadilla. The burrito came with 6 chips & if you want salsa you have to purchase it, $3 for about an ounce. Not recommended. AT ALL. Wish I would have spent my $80 elsewhere
