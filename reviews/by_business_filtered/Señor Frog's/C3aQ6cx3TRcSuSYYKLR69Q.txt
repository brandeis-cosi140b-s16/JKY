I knew from the 3-day old stale chips and salsa from a jar that I definitely wasn't going to order Mexican food. Strike One  Ordered a Cobb salad instead which was served on a nice hot salad plate. Strike 2. Service was sluggish at best. Strike 3. The only thing that could have made the experience any worse was if the karaoke was cranked up to11 and two old fat chicks sang "I Will Survive". Strike 4? I highly recommend Senor Frogs in Acapulco, but do yourself a favor and skip the one in Las Vegas. Dos thumbs down.
