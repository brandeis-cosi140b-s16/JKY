Yuck. Just yuck. I am NOT a picky eater and I sent my food back, the rest of our groups food was so bad I didn't even want to order anything else. Snob according to a few other reviews?  Maybe. Or I just have taste buds! 

I ordered the blt wrap. There was hardly any bacon, what there was was like bacon bits. The lettuce was slimy, wilted and just gross. The tortilla was so tough that it took effort for us to tear it at all with our hands,  let alone take a bite. 

The two good things about this place was our server (Ernesto) and the french fries. Other than that it was overpriced and didn't taste good at all.  Maybe because we went in the afternoon?  I dunno. But we will be avoiding Senior Frogs like the plague!
