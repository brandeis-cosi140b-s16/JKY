We were here Saturday, 10/12/13 with a group for an early dinner. We arrived at 5:00 pm. Our waiter didn't even take our order til 6:00, food arrived about 20 minutes later. My wife ordered the ribs, they were chewy and tasteless ..... In edible to say the least. I enjoy a good draft beer in a tall cold glass and they  serve the. Beer in a plastic cup! For 8 bucks a pop, I think that a draft beer can be served in a real glass. I had the fajitas and they were served with flours tortillas that were chewy and tasted as though the had had been laying out in the open for days! I will never go back to Se√±or Frogs again! Worst food, drinks and service I have seen in years!

What really hurt was we were a party of 9, so our bill included an 18% gratuities that the server did NOT earn.
