I don't know why this place has a low rating I had a blast! I spent my 21st birthday here. I got there at 12:01 and only planned of spending an hour there at most. The things that changed my mind was the dj he was on point mixing older songs and top hits. The drinks were a little pricy but what do you expect for vegas? I didn't have any food so I can't say anything about that but the drinks were well made and the decor was interesting and cute.  Would definitely go back!
