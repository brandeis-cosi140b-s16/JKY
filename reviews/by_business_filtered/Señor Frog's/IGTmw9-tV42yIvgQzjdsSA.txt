This was a bad joke. Went here excited with family for lunch and spent $130 on very subpar food and drinks. Even though the lagoon is drained and there is no Pirate show, the prices are still ridiculously high for Las Vegas.

My wife's margarita that she couldn't get down because it tasted like sour patch kids with no alcohol was $27, my basic nachos with beef were $20, wife's chimi was $20, basic burger 20 bucks, you get it.  Kids virgin margarita 10 bucks and neither of my kids would drink them because they didn't taste good.

Not sure how they can get away with charging these prices with average food and subpar drinks while under construction.  Left really pissed off.
