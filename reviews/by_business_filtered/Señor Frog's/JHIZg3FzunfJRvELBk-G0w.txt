Got to say this was the second Halloween we have spent here, this year and last year.  Very disappointed.  We had a group of ten plus people for two years and a row.  We ate dinner, it was mediocre at best.  Chicken tacos where dry and no flavor, basically just cooked chicken with cheese on top.  Enchiladas were ok, I could do a better job cooking at home, kind of sad for Vegas.  Last night oct 31, 2014, partied all night there after dinner.  Spent $60+ on dinner, plus $35 for all you can drink for myself and $55 for my wife's top shelf all you can drink.  Pretty reasonable drinking price for Vegas, but by 2 am tried to order tap water, in my all you can drink cup, and the bartender said $4 for a bottled water.  I said no tap water for free in my cup, he said no again trying to get me to buy a bottled water.  As we argued back and forth I finally gave up.  My wife went to the manager and complained how much money we spent for all you can drink and dinner, and that we should at least get our free water.  Crazy!  Then during the costume contest confetti was sprayed throughout the crowd, of course what do you do with confetti other than throw it.  Everyone was doing it, but the manager came over and grabbed my hand said not to throw the confetti.  He then grabbed my wife's hand too, I told him to let her go.  I can't believe he had the nerve to put his hand on her.  I was so pissed.  Unbelievable this guy is a manager.  This will be the last time our group goes to se√±or frogs.
