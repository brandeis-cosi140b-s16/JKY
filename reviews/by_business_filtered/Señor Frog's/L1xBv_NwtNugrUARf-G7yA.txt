I really hate writing bad reviews especially as the staff had NOTHING to do with this.   The ownership here is awful.  Its completely switch and bait.  They hand out these coupons on the strip buy one drink and get another for free so we come in for happy hour expecting a good deal.   What they do not tell you is that these "drinks" are HUGE and literally cost  20.00 to 28.00 a piece.   For two of us just an appetizer and two drink orders a piece @ 2/1 on coupon our bill came out to over $100.00.   We of course tipped the waiter 20.00 but other guests were not tipping at all due to the rip off scheme they have going there.   We really felt taken advantage of and we felt like they prey on the tourists.  We did not take that out on the wait staff but after quiet inquiries we were told this happens a lot where guests complain to the staff there.   We will never go there again and we have friends that frequent vegas and neither will they and they are also writing their reviews.  We were with a rather large group when we went down for my birthday just recently.  We have relatives that live there and we should have asked where to go or looked on yelp.  After looking at how many stars this place has its no big surprise.   If I could give it a 0 I really would and that just PAINS me having worked in this industry years ago.   The entertainment was good but after seeing the bill I was seeing red too much to be in too much of a good mood even after the drinks and the entertainment.   The owners should really be ashamed for preying on people like this.   I am sure though with the size of their pocket books they don't care much.   Its no wonder they have to hand out coupons and scam people to get people in there.   I am SURE they have zero repeat business at this place.
