Oh...wow!  This place was so...odd for Vegas.  It was just the last thing I was expecting but so much fun.  The drinks are pretty good and I kind of like how interactive it all is.  There was even a conga line and who can say no to a conga line that involves free shots?  Fair warning though, they pour it directly in your mouth and I'm pretty sure it's more juice than booze.  I don't recommend going here on a Saturday night however, it is ridiculously dead.  My favorite part though were the signs.  They have hilarious signs posted, literally, all over the bar saying things like: "Kinky is using the feather; perverted is using the whole chicken" and "looking for a meaningful, one night relationship."   It kind of reminded me of home how laid back it was.  I would make a stop at Senor Frog's next time I'm in Vegas.
