Sunday Night Review

Senor Frogs is the vacationing tourist bar/ dance spot to go to if you don't want to deal with the crazy pretentious crowd of Cali residents that drove all the way to Vegas to be packed in a club on top of one another.

Its located in the front of the Treasure Island Resort and at 10:30pm you have to be at least 21 or older to enter for a night of drinking and dancing. The DJ was cool, he played top 40s and some hip hop music so we all danced the night away. They were celebrating one of the staff members leaving the TI pirate show so in honor of that we all got up and did the Wobble dance. There was also this 2 for 1 margarita special with the huge souvenir cups so you know we jumped up on that deal.

Fun Fun Fun.
