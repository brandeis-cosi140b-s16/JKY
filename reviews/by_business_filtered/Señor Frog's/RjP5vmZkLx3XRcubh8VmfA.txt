Terrible customer service!  Stopped by in the afternoon and wanted a table.  Told there was a wait even though it wasn't busy and I saw several open tables.  The hostess told us we could order our food at the bar and then when a table opened up she would move us to the table.  Ten minutes pass by and I remind her of the table.  She tells me that since we already ordered food we have to eat at the bar.  I cancelled that order so fast and hightailed it out of there.  I WISH I knew her name so i could throw her under the bus.  Friggin ragamuffin...I took my business elsewhere!
