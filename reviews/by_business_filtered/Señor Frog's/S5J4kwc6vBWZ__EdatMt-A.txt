We came in for dinner this past weekend and, I have to say, this is the perfect place to launch into a crazy night out in Vegas! 

The servers where friendly and always on-hand with another boozy beverage. The new Kallpod devices on the tables were incredibly useful! We attacked some fetticini alfredo (gotta carbo-load!) and laid waste to some tasty margaritas then the night continued from there!
