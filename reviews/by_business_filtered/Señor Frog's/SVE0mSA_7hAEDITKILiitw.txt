How is this place still in business? It's not only overpriced, but some of the worst quality tasting food ever. We tried to give it a shot since it was close to TI. But seriously, stay away at all costs. Waste of time and money. We get there and order or food & drinks. The juice we got was WATERED DOWN. never have I gotten watered down juice in my life. Look, its already over priced because it's Vegas, but you're gonna try and be cheap and water down your drinks too? .. actually, maybe that's how theyr'e staying in business, by changing the quality of all their food with shortcuts. 

I ask them if I can change the pineapple juice to orange juice, cause hey, what if it's just that juice? Nope. Same result. 45 minutes later our food arrives. Nothing looks fresh, or appetizing. The beans tasted like canned beans. My friend had to order something completely different because she couldn't even eat her food. So she got a salad, since it's pretty hard to screw up a salad. I got a Burger which I asked for medium well and of course got well done. The bun was hard as a rock, I was able to knock on it.. The fries did not taste very fresh, like the oil's never been changed. 

Do yourself a favor, save your money and appetite and take it elsewhere.
