1 star for food 5 stars for service. Let me say you are paying for "LLL" location location location! Food is way way way over priced but I guess thank god they had a special going on for the appetizers  buy one get one half off "bogo" lol. Nachos ranged between $20-23 depending on meat and $15 for a plain medium size quesadilla $18 for a wetish burrito. Nachos were edible but not good they over heated the plate so the cheese was hard and brown I never had olives on nachos but never again will I lol, the Quesadilla was well good who could mess that up lol, the burrito was alright. I don't think I'll be coming back I should have listen to all the Yelp reviews lol.
