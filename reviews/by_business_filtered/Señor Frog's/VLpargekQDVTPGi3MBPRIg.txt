I would give Se単or Frog's negative stars if it were allowed by Yelp.

I went to se単or frogs with a group of 10 friends on a bachelorette party.  We had reservations that were not honored by a snippy hostess.  The manager scooted us around the bar, and the bartender made rude comments towards multiple members of our party.  We had originally planned on spending a few hours eating and drinking at Se単or Frogs, but we cut our visit short due to the horrible service.  If you are in Vegas skip Se単or Frogs.  :(
