Didn't order food!

We were given a 2 for 1 drink special coupon while walking down the strip. My love and I decided to drop by this place to grab a drink before blowing our money at the Casino. I was worried there was a catch to this coupon, but to my surprise, there was none :) We ordered 2 Jameson on the rocks for only $10! What a steal :D I believe the amount of alcohol poured was very fair (I HATE when it's 90% ice 10% alcohol).

This place is C-C-CRAZYYYY. Everyone is drunk and getting their groove on. It's actually quite fun to just watch while sippin' on drinks. I saw a few tables dining in, but I think I'll pass on food served here. It's VEGAS! There are so many other appetizing places to eat.

It's super dark in here. That's how you know it's going to be crackinn' ;) Fast service, but nothing spectacular.

Tip: Gather a bunch of friends to grab a few drinks here before going to bigger and better things. This place will light the party fire in you, no doubt.

On a side note: everyone that works here is good looking :X both males and females!
