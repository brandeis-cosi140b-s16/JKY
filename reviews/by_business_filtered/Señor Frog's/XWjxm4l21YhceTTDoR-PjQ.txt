This place was so pitiful, I don't even want to give them a "one star" rating.  That's how bad it was.  Anyway...for starters...when you check into the hotel (Treasure Island ... which is it's own separate bummer, by the way.  But I'm here to yelp the Frog, so sticking to that for now.)  they give you a slew of what appears to be coupon "deals" for you to consider while staying.  Along with their coupons, you'll encounter perched people throughout the casino handing out similar coupons to the same good for nothing over-rated over-priced bar attractions.  However, the coupon says 2-for-1 "yard" drink .... so you can't help but wander in and "check it out".  So me and my boyfriend did.  Big mistake!!!  We got 2 yard sized margaritas with no alcohol (I didn't order them as virgin drinks either) and a bill for $35 (which included a bar fee) .... I was like WTF?? Bar fee?? ... what the hell is that?? ... I'm being charged to sit in their place, I guess. Whatever.  Back to the drinks....nothing but a complete rip off.  The waiter conveniently over charged me for drinks we didn't order...and later when I brought it to his attention...he said "my bad" (LOL...really? That's all you got for me?). Also, when I mentioned the lack of alcohol in my yard size margarita...the waiter brought  me one small shot to pour in....and said "sorry, next time you visit us, and if the drinks are weak, just let me know. I'll take care of you." (again,  I'm laughing and shaking my head).  I suggest you turn around and walk back out before you sit down and get trapped.  Next!!!
BTW... the place seems to attract the really duncy type of college kids.  Not exactly the environment I enjoy spending my leisure time at.  Again....next!! Too many other places in Las Vegas you can joyfully waste your money at. This is not one of them.
