I came in tonight and we were charged 41.63 for dinner FOUR TIMES. I find this very odd because, our server took our card for over 10 minutes and told us she had to call our bank to confirm the charge and authorize which I find VERY odd because, we haven't had any issues in Las Vegas! I am very disappointed. My husbands burrito was not the best but, my carne was decent. This was a very bad experience for us and even worse now because, I have nearly 200$ out of my account while I am on vacation and cant get ahold of anyone!
