Sadly, the LV restaurants are getting away with charging A LOT of money for some crappy food! I asked for water, right away cuz I'd been walking in 104 degree temperatures, but had to wait quite a while for it to arrive. Guess the waiter had to run to the pump?  16 oz margarita, which supposedly has 2 shot of tequila in it, was watery and warm.  Got the beef tacos, which gave my jaw a pretty good workout. The beef chunks were tough, and tasted like they only threw some Lawry's Taco Seasoning on.  SO disappointed!  Bill was $30 - one person - one margarita - three tacos!  Damn water is expensive!
