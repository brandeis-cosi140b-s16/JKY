Let me just say that I REALLY love frozen daiquiri places. I was in heaven in Vegas in this respect. So when I saw the swirling machines as I was walking through another casino (Treasure Island, maybe?) and I didn't already have a drink in my hand, I made a bee-line right over (really hard to do in a casino). I already had a souvenir glass (several, actually) and he said he'd give me the refill price to fill it even though it wasn't theirs. I think I chose the "fruit punch" option. There were only 2 options and I think the other was "margarita". Whichever one I chose, it tasted like it had a frog in it. I joked that that was the origin of the name, but seriously it was not good. I was able to go to a regular bar in the casino and have them add some grenadine to cut the frogginess and it made it palatable enough to finish.
There's a great daiquiri place in San Diego (Wet Willies; they have multiple US locations) but in SD you can't take your drink out with you like in Vegas. That still doesn't make up for the frog flavour.
