We went on a busy night and it's not hard to believe they were busy as the outside deck has a view of the Treasure Island pirate show which if you time it right, can be seen from your table. We went inside and the restaurant was busy and because there was an hour long wait to get a table we decided to grab a table outside near the bar, but also so we could watch the show. When sitting, I went to the bar and grabbed menus to take to the table. I did not expect table service as I was in the bar area and planed to pick up food/drink at the bar and take to the table. Our bartender was BENHAM and he was awesome. Once he noticed what I was doing, Without asking he came from around the bar and came to the table not only to take our order but also to bring our food and check up on us through our meal. AWESOME CUSTOMER SERVICE. Benham was helpful, friendly and funny - the service we received was exceptional. Rarely do you make a personal connection when visiting an establishment for the first however the experience i received not only earned my respect but also established my loyalty. We came for a good time and got exactly that. I will return the next time I am in Vegas, and I have been back since.
