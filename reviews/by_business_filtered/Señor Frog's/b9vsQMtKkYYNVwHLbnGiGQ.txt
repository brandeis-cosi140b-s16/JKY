Fun atmosphere and great view of the strip. I'm coming back with friends next time in vegas!  This place is always a party.  I was there on a Tuesday night while in town for work and it gave me a good chuckle.  There was Karaoke and free drinks! Lol. It also over looks the strip and has a nice outdoor patio. The service was great and the food was to be expected.
