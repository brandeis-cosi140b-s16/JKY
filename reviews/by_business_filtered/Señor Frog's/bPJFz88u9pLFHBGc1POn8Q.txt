My hubby and myself came here looking for a late night drink with a bite to eat!  Arrived about 10ish and sat at the patio/bar area.  We were promptly greeted by a friendly bartender who was nice and very informative.  We ordered drinks and when we asked for a food menu we were informed that the kitchen was closed!  WTF!!! Are you serious!??  10:15 at a Las Vegas casino and the kitchen is closing????!  Anyway....we continued to order drinks however we were told that the bar was doing a last call and we would need to order our last drinks NOW or either go inside the club for more drinks!  It was 10:30....Not happy!  Needless to say we closed out our check and left!  Will not return!
