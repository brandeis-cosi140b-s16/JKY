I got food poisoning here on 2/11/2015. Hadn't eaten anything all day, so my girlfriend and I ordered the quesadillas and fajitas. Within 2 hours we were both deathly ill...throwing up, diarrhea, and feverish. 24 hours later, I'm still hoping to be able to get out of bed or eat something soon. 

Aside from the fact that it made us sick, the food was mediocre at best. The waitress gave terrible service, and we kept getting pestered by staff wanting to take our picture or put balloons on our heads. 

This might be an alright place to go and get sloppy drunk, but forget eating here.
