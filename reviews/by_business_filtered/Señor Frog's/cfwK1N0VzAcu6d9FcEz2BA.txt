I just scrolled through previous reviews and read not so good reviews. I had the total opposite experience here.

I got married on August 22, 2015 and decided to have our rehearsal dinner the day prior on August 21, 2015. We had been searching and "tasting" different restaurants on the strip being that many of wedding party were coming from out of state and we wanted to keep the dinner near their hotels. Our wedding reception was pretty formal, so after many taste testing ventures, we decided we wanted to hold our rehearsal dinner at a venue where everyone could mingle with eachother in a fun comfortable atmosphere.

I remembered that we had taken my son to Senor Frogs for his 21st birthday. I contacted them by email inquiring about special events and I was immediately contacted by Denny. I requested to come into the restaurant after 5:00 PM to view the area of where we could hold our rehearsal dinner and he stated he would make himself available at any time. My husband and I visited that same night and knew the restaurant would be a perfect place for the atmosphere we were wanting! 

We held our rehearsal dinner for 30 people on August 21, 2015 and everything was set up as planned with food, tables, chairs, and was even accommodated when I had to add 6 extra people with the very little notice.  We chose to have dinner buffet style non-stop for 2 hours. Denny continuously checked on us to make sure everything was ok and our waitress Veronica (I think that as her name) was very patient with our large group! Thanks a bunch to these 2! :) 

The only complaint I have is the heat! lol We sat outside facing the strip, which was a beautiful view but hot, and although they provided misters and fans, we were sweating! August is a very hot month in Vegas, so I had I been a little bit smarter, I would've requested to be seated inside! I'm a local, so I should've known better! lol 

Overall, we all had a great time! :)
