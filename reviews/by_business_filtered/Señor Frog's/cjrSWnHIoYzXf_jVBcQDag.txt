Went to Se√±or Frogs for dinner during what we thought would be a peak time. It turned out to be a terrible experience. We ordered nachos, and cheese steaks, as well as a soda and one refill.

To start, the Soda is $6 each! The two pops I had were $2 less than my meal. The cups were half filled with ice, so the pop was very watered down. We were offered the unbalanced cups to take home, but they were heavily used and dinged. When getting the bill, I confronted the waiter about the price and he didn't seem to care, or make any effort to resolve my concern.

The food we ordered was terribly bland, and I am disappointed this was my last dinner Vegas. The nachos were soggy because they put all the toppings on top of the chips (guacamole, sour cream, salsa, fried beans). The cheese steak was terribly bland and dry, with just a thin layer of beef.

The restaurant itself was empty, although we went at dinner time. This could be for a number of reasons, but it meant a restaurant with blaring music, 5 servers bothering us every minute, and a friendly note on the bill that said

"Tips not included. Grasia$$$"

I will never return to this restaurant, and I will make sure that it is never recommended to anyone I ask.

Eek! Methinks not.
