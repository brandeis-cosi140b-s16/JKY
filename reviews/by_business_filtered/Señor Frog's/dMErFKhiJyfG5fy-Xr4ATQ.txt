This place was so horrible I can't believe they get away with it.. The food is outrageously priced, the service is HORRIBLE, and a shot is $15 (shitty beer is $8).. My husband and I ordered the carne asada that came with a chimichanga for $29.50.. The meat was chewy, skinny, and fatty throughout with gristle and they didn't ask how we wanted it prepared which is crazy for a $30 meal,  the chimichanga I SWEAR was from Albertsons in the frozen food section because it tasted like the chimichanga I eat when I'm in a rush at home.  

PLEASE!!! Don't eat here if/when you visit Vegas.. We live here for the time being and had company in town and decided to eat here before Mystere (a show at TI) and it was so bad every one of us said it was the WORST food, service, and price we'd ever had, even for the strip. This place should be shut down.. 

OH!  I was just reminded... I ran into another diner sitting near us that was appalled and ran into her in the bathroom and she was feeling sick and figured it was probably food poisoning. 

One final note - They make balloon hats, etc. for kids or people with birthdays and when you're seated in the restaurant the person filling up the balloons with air constantly pops them which freaks you out.  I only write on Yelp if something is this bad.. THIS is that bad and needs to go away..
