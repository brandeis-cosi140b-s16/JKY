Service was great but drinks and prices were horrible.  Mojito and margarita were served in plastic cups with more ice than drink, paid eleven each for lunch time.  Nachos were great but wasn't exactly how we ordered.  Probably wouldn't come to this one again..I'll stick with the locations I know and trust.
