The food here was awful- like, the EDR in Treasure Island probably serves better food than this place. Not only is the food horrible, but it is completely overpriced for even strip standards. 

Then you think, well okay- the drinks should be good then! How can you mess up alcohol? Well, you can charge $20 or so for a vodka red bull- that's more than the nicest nightclubs on the strip.

So what is the draw here? The food was gross, the drinks were mediocre & the service was sub par... 

I'm sure we'll see something pop up in this location in no time! :)
