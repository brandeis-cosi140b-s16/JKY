The violence at this bar on Latin Nights is atrocious. The security is understaffed and the management is more worried about picking up women and giving them shots.  My wife was assaulted by a male guest and management and security wasn't worried about it and refused to do anything about it because it was an off duty LA County Sheriff who was intoxicated and belligerent. I would advise people to not patronize this establishment because your safety is at risk especially on Saturday nights!!!
