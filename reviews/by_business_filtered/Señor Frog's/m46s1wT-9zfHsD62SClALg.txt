I was expecting crappy service and subpar food.  We usually stay at treasure Island but never eat at senor frogs thinking they mostly focus on drinking so their food must suck right??  Wrong! Service was fast...food was hot upon delivery to our table.  We had the chicken fajitas, wings and chips with Salsa....all absolutely delish!!  The atmosphere is super fun too....they can tell who is looking for fun and who just wants to left alone.  Late a night they had a dj.  Pretty ok place to party if you don't feel like getting dolled up and heading accross the street to wait in line at TAO.  No it's not a fancy place to party, but its a good place to let loose and not worry about dress shoes and $50 cover.  Beware of first timers late at night who seem like its their first time drinking or making out with strangers...quite a lot of creepers or booty shakers but hey! at least everyone is having a good time!
