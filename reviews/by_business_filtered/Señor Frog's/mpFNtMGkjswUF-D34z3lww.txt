Went to this place for New Year's as a last minute thing. Me and my peeps paid 100 bucks cover with open bar. It was lame. It was hard even get a drink, it was so dead, and the bartenders were lazy as hell. There was only one bartender on duty after the countdown and he was making out with his waitress g/f/ for the next fifteen minutes. Because of this, no one was able to get a drink. It was full of people having a midlife crisis and a few nerds attempting to be the next Tucker Max. I only went there because there was a change in plans and my folks were staying at the T.I. which sucks as well, while I was staying at the Palazzo. I should've gone to TAO and gotten in for free.
