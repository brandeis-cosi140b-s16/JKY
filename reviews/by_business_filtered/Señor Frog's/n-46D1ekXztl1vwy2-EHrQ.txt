Had the $20 burrito that should at least taste as good as a fast food resturant but I was sorely disappointed. The chips that came with the meal were stale and cold. The drinks are way over priced touristy "yards". The service could really care less about your meal so long as you want another overpriced drink. This place is crappy tourist trap bar with worse service. Ballon artist was good......
