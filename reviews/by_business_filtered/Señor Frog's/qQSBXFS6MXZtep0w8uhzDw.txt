If I had to rate the food, it would probably get  2 stars...  but they get 5 stars because the staff is amazing! Our waitress, Krista, was so helpful and sweet and that's shocking at a loud crazy bar in Vegas! And not just her, the manager and another waiter (so mad because I can't remember their names) but they were so nice and on top of their sh*t! But other then the amazing staff, the music and drinks were great to! Definitely going back the next time I am in Vegas!
