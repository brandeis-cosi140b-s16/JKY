We had a Groupon, otherwise the score would have probably been only 2. The food wasn't that great for the price. However, their drinks were super yummy and not terribly priced considering it is located in Vegas. I got the Philly Cheese Steak sandwich, and I wasn't impressed. The fries that came on the side tasted good though. My friend got the Cheese Enchiladas and said they were a bit too spicy for her liking, but otherwise good. In addition to so-so food, it was an extremely loud environment. There was at times a band, other times karaoke singers, and in between there was someone on stage talking and having games to win a free shot of alcohol. This I suppose could be someone's cup of tea, however it wasn't mine. Too loud and just average food. Also, there seemed to be only children and older people, no one really in between. It was strange seeing 40+ year old women screaming drunk right next to us, but I suppose that's Vegas for you!
