So we came here before our show at Treasure Island and stopped for a drink and I was not impressed. It seemed like a cheap wanna be version of Diablo's. Really cheesy and sucky drink selection.

One drink was about $13 and totally not worth it, should of just grabbed a drink in the casino. Didn't even take a pic here since overall I was totally disappointed. Hotel was facing Treasure Island and it looked appealing from far away. 

Do yourself a favor save your money and go to Diablos they have strong, drinks that are made right and good food.

Here..not so much. Two thumbs down.
