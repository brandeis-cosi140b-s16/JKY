Save your money. The food is like super overpriced Taco Bell. The table they sat us at was dirty. You can feel the salt grit on it. The next table was a tad cleaner. The waiter was good and the entertainment was great! ( thank you Greg).  The food is dreadful. We ordered the flavorless Tortilla Soup, over dressed BLT wrap, and  fair Chicken Fajitas. The prices on the food was way too much not worth it. The drinks were good, just skip the food.
