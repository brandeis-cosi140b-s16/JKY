Summary:  The wait staff does a very poor job or paying attention to the diners.  They are also very unprofessional and childish.  The food is pricey and bland, but they do give you a decent portion.  There is nothing at Señor Frogs that had a positive impact on me.  It's unprofessional and poorly ran.

I've never been to a Señor Frogs before so maybe they're all not like this one.  After being seated, no attention was brought to us by the wait staff for a little under five minutes.  The place was half full, but our waiter, Robert, was at a table next to us entertaining three moderately attractive girls.  We gave our drink and lunch order at the same time and the food came out pretty quickly.  The Philly Cheese Steak was bland and was served with gravy.  Not sure why they felt the need to give me gravy though...

Throughout our meal we were distracted several times.  A whistle sounded behind me and our waiter Robert was standing with one leg on the table next to us and one on a chair.  He was standing above a (what I assume was) a teenage kid holding a bottle of some mixed alcoholic drink.  The boys mother asked if it contained alcohol, confirming my assumption, and Robert said it did.  Regardless, he started tweeting his whistle and another waitress chanted "Chug, chug, chug,..." while pouring the drink down the boys throat.

Not long after, Robert was back at the table next to us desperately trying to hit on the moderately attractive girls.  He eventually put one of the ladies' face into his chest and had her motorboat him.  The two elderly couples at the next table were none too pleased.

Basically, Señor Frogs was very unprofessional and had pricey, bland food.  Additionally, they never brought my table the sugar for the ice tea we ordered.  I will not be returning.
