Visited Senor Frogs on vacation. I was there on the night of their nightclub opening and The Situations Birthday Bash. We did not eat here, but went up to the nightclub...There werent many places to sit or tables. the dance floor was small, with a dj stand, and a dancer who did not know how to dance. The view from the night club was nice, and the drinks were ok. Left shortly after The Situation arrived, Would try it one more time, but wasnt to impressed.
