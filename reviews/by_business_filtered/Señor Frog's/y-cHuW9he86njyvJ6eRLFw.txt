Ugggh. 
I want to like this place, I really do, but nope can't do it. I understand that on the strip everything is more expensive and I don't mind paying for quality but there's few things I hate more than paying for a bad time. 
I've come here both for the restaurant and the bar and both times I walked away questioning myself. 
The food here is super meh. Like it's not disgusting, but wouldn't be my first, second, or even third choice. The burgers, fries and everything was tasteless 
That all could be forgiven if they actually handled the alcohol properly. I tried the yard, and it tasted metallic and not very strong. I switched over to screwdriver, but apparently the bartender forgot that vodka goes in there because I only tasted juice. Another time when I came in, I was waiting at the bar for about 10 minutes, was barely acknowledged and it wasn't until one of my female friends who is quite easy on the eyes did my drink order get taken, and it was quite possible the worst AMF I've ever had and I don't say that lightly. You have to be absolutely horrible for me to stop drinking alcohol that I paid for
The only good things about this place is that it's great for dancing, I had a blast doing that and the signs on the roof are funny, but not worth it for me
