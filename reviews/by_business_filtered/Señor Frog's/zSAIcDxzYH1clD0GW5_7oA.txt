Taco Bell Food For 100 times the price that it is worth...
Don't waste your time, money, or patience.
We had a buy one get one free yard drink and thought we would go there. Seems like a good deal. Well each "yard" is $33.00... We were very hungry and decided that the food might be ok so my spouse and I each ordered a burrito ($20.00 each). It was about the quality level of Taco Bell mixed with bagged chips and soggy tortillas.
