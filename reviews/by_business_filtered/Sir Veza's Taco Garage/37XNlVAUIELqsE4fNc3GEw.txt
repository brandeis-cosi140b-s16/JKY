Ok, this is not an ordinary airport restaurant. It's not the fastest service, but it is one of THE BEST fish tacos and the MOST INCREDIBLE green chili and cheese tamales I've ever had. And I've tried both at many, many restaurants. After spending 25 years living in Houston and traveling throughout the U.S. But since this restaurant is located in an airport most people enter with a bad attitude to begin with. The hassle of traveling, long lines, rude people...but people right next door to each other are two little gems in the Phoenix Sky Harbor Headache....Cartel Coffee and Sir Veza's Taco Garage.

Great sides also...guacamole, black beans and Spanish rice. Fish tacos available at breakfast too...big plus.
