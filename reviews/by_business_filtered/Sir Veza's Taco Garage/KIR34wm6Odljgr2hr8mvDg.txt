I stopped in here for a bite on 1/22/14 at 3:19PM and ended up ordering one beef and one chicken taco to go.  Both seemed to taste ok but a number of hours later I had a very bad case of food poisoning that lasted about 24 hours.  Anyone that has been sick from food this was about a 7 or 8 on a scale with 10 being the worst.  I'm just not sure which taco it was that got me sick but it was either the chicken or the beef.  Beef and chicken seemed cooked as I recall.

I went the through the airport recently again and asked a shoe shiner about this place and that person suggested that it is known "not good" by the people that work in the terminal.  I would avoid.
