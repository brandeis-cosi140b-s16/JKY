The vegetarian tamales here were excellent. I am a picky tamale critic, having grown up in CA, but this spot fit the bill. The breakfast bowl was pretty tasty, though I guess I was expecting it to be over rice. The tortilla chips were an odd find, but hey, I guess a starch is a starch...sort of. I would've preferred eggs and sour cream etc over rice, but it was still good. Had my flight been delayed any longer I would've gone back for more items from the lunch menu. Service here was fast, even during busy rushes. I'll definitely come back here on my next layover on Southwest. Thanks guys!
