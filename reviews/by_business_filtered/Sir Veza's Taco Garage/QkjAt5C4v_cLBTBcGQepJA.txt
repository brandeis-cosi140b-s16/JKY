So first off I feel it's important to say that this place is in the airport, which I feel colors the review. All in all the place is good for its location. That and the ability to leave an airport eatery with fairly interesting food and a good beer for $15 is pretty good. 

The style of the place is a hipster chipotle. Flavor is pretty good and not that inventive. Options are tacos, burritos and bowls w/ the same meat options as chipotle. So why not go to chipotle?  2 reasons, 1. There isn't one and 2. The beer. Again the beer.

So they have 20 different beers on tap, locales and national micro brews. They allow taste before you buy and are pretty good. 

3 on its merits, 4 because of an airport.
