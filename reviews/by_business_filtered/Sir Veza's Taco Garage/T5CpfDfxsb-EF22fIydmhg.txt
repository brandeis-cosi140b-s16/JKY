I had the most amazing fish tacos ever!!
First off, they give you plenty of fish on your tacos unlike some places that get stingy with their fish.. They had lots of toppings on them, very flavorful... Probably one of the best fish tacos I've ever had!
As far as the atmosphere... I mean I'm eating at the one in the airport on my journey to Denver... It's not bad for what space they get to work with. 
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone flying or If there is another one is definitely come again!
