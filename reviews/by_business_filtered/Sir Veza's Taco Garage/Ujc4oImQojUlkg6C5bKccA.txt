Stopped here for a quick bite prior to my flight. Made my bowl vegan which basically came down to 5 ingredients and boy did they skimp. For the price, and I get it.... The airport is always overpriced, but then you add in the reduction of food choices that comes with the meal and it was like I got half the serving for a full price. Needless to say it was not worth the price at all. The speed however was super quick and seeing the amount of people they were serving food to at once that was pretty impressive. 

Well, you live and you learn next time I just have to pack my lunch when flying, just sucks when you're delayed. Maybe they can figure out some kind of balance to make the cost with it.
