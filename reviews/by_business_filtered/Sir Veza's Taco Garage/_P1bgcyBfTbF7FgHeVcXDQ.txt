We had a layover and looked forward to a nice cup of soup while waiting. What we got was a salt lick of tortilla soup and when we attempted to alert the counter server, Trisha, of our dislike, we were dished up a huge helping of bad attitude. Total rudeness topped with no eye contact.

This was not at all what we expected. What happened to service with a smile?

We cannot recommend Sir Veza's to any future terminal 4 visitors.
