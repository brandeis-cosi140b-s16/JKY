I needed lunch during a layover. Unfortunately, PHX doesn't have many options. So I settled on this place. The decor was fun and the menu LOOKED good. But it is best not to judge a book by its cover. 

First, we ordered the sliders. I was starving but my wife just wanted a snack. Figuring the sliders might be enough to satisfy us both, we ordered them. You get TWO sliders for $8. They were flavorless, but not terrible.

Because that didn't satisfy my hunger, I went back and ordered the nachos. Nachos, how hard could that be? Ok, these were TERRIBLE! The cheese, wasn't cheese. And it didn't even come close to tasting like cheese. The meat certainly didn't look like meat. And the chips weren't very good either. I've never done this before, but I actually returned them. I wasn't about to pay $12 for the 2 terrible bites my wife and I took. 

Find another place, you won't be happy eating here.
