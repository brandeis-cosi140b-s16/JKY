I had about an hour to spare between early morning flights at Skyharbor and so decided to try out a new place.

I ordered the turkey sausage sliders as I hadn't seen those on a menu before.

I think everything is cooked fresh and so it took a few minutes to prepare (which was fine for me, but if you have to catch a flight that might not be great).

The bread buns were nice a light/fluffy - perhaps like brioche - the turkey sausage was kind of flavourless, the egg "pancake" was terrible, like microwaved frozen eggs terrible I honestly thought it was a pancake at first until I looked at the menu again.  There was some cheese present, but it had no taste.

I added both the salsa they give you and some sriracha I asked for, but nothing could save the sliders.

There was a side of fried potatoes/papas but they were very small pieces and had been overcooked.

Based on this meal I would not eat here again.
