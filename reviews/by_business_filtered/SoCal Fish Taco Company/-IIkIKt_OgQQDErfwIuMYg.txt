I always prefer the Mom and Pop shops to anything from a chain.  This place is a perfect example of the reason why:
1) Value: The prices here are more than fair.  We got out with our family of four for less than 35 bucks.
2) Quality:  The fish was all beyond fresh. The garnishes and tortillas were the same.  Very fresh and very tasty.
3) Service:  Casual and genuine.  The drinks never had a chance to get empty and the kids never had a chance to get bored waiting.  
4) Taste:  I personally had the mahi tacos.  Wow!  They were jammed with fish and the mango salsa paired with them was fantastic.  
This place is a must try.  Worth a drive if you aren't in the neighborhood.  My kind of food!
