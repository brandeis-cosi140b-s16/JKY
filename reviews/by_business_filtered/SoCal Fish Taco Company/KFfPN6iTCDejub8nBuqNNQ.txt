Food was very good and prepared from scratch. The calamari was outstanding   The batter was light and the sticks  were not something I had seen before. They were plump and the calamari was very very tender. Not a bit chewy. Wife had chicken tacos. She said they very good. They have a small selection of craft beers. Service was good. Will be back to try some other items.
