Finally made my way into socal fish company and boy was I surprised.
The outside patio was inviting and the service was on point.
I had to try the oyster po boy which was very very tastey. The true oyster taste was excellent and at a reasonable 8.00
My fiance had a trio of tacos which were also good.
My only gripe would be the oh so standard frozen fries.
They are what they are......
It's time for a good frie folks.
Good experience.....i'll be back
