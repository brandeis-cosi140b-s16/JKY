My husband and I went to SoCal Fish last night.  We had a great experience from the friendly employees to the delicious food.  The decor is super fun and cool.  Everything looked clean and well maintained.  Our waitress Jackie was very helpful in helping us choose a beer and tacos.  We started with the best calamari fries we've ever had, tortilla soup and ceviche tacos.  The ceviche was so amazing! For dinner, we had lobster tacos, the special of the month, and the seared ahi tuna salad with the sesame dressing.  Both were exceptional!  We had such a great experience! The place was packed and everyone was hustling.  The patio had a bunch of heaters but I was chilly sitting inside as both the doors were open.  Just bring a sweater.  All in all, we can't wait to go back and bring our three kids or visitors when they are in town.  Wish this place was closer to our house, like in Chandler:)
