Had lunch here and sat outside. The misters cooled us slightly and felt good. Had fish ceviche as an app; a nice dish to share. The homemade sangria was very refreshing. My wife had the scallop tacos. Be aware they use bay scallops not sea scallops. I had tge seafood di mare tamale which was incredible. Each dish is served with a small side of rice, beans and salsa with chips. We will definitely return!
