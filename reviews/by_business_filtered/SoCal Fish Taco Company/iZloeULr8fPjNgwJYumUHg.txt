My husband I came here for the first time on a Wednesday evening around 7:30 and had an enjoyable dinner.  

We ordered the calamari fries based on other Yelp reviews, but I didn't think they were amazing - they were just good.  To be honest, they reminded me of frozen fish sticks that you were forced to eat as a kid.  However, the accompanying dipping sauces added that extra umpf and made them pretty tasty.  

We also had the beer battered lobster tacos, which were a special.  They were great! I would definitely get those again. 

Service was fast, friendly and attentive.  The outside patio area was very quaint and relaxing.  Another great Gilbert restaurant!! :)
