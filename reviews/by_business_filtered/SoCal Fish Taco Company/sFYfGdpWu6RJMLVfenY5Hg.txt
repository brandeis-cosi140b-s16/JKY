Recommended by a friend, we stopped here for an early dinner with our dog. The servers were very accommodating about having our dog with us which was important to us.

We were seated at the outside dining area. The whole place is very casual, but the food is exceptional! The food is served on paper plates!

We had the Tamale Del Mar which was excellent. The Steak Salad was fresh and the salsa ranch dressing was delicious. We had the crab cakes for an appetizer and they were quite good as well.

Lots of parking in the back. This is destined to be a regular stop for us.
