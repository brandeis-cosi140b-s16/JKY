This place was delicious! The veggie burrito was amazing. I am only giving three stars because they charged me $1.62 for the smallest cup of guacamole I have ever seen in my life. $1.62!!!! And I came here to eat with the last of my money till payday. Other Mexican good places charge way less for way more guac. We paid for 3 full meals, it would have been nice to have a courtesy cup of guac. And the lady that took my order didn't seem to know how to smile. Other than that the food was good.
