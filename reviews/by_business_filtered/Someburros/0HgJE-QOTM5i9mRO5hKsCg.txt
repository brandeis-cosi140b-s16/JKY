I stopped in today on a whim after a Trader Joe's visit. I was impressed by how clean and organized it was inside! Maybe all the construction that had been going on had me associating it with dirt, but there was none to be found! 

Due to a lunch hour time crunch, I automatically opted for the daily special- a Boracho Burrito and large drink. For 8 bucks I was impressed by the quality: 
The chips were standard issue corn and the salsa was in a little squirt bottle that the cashier got out of a fridge behind the counter. It was blended instead of chunky-which I find muy bueno. 
There were good sized chunks of tender beef in the burrito, a ton of cheese on top, extra sauce all over and generous dollops of guac and sour cream on the side. Definitely a solid, inexpensive meal. I will hit it up again for sure. 

*For some reason it got me thinking about one of my fave college days hangouts- Two Peso's! Except they dont have a guy yelling "Two-FEEFTY-four, nomber twoFEEFTYfour" when your order is up. Loved that.
**That was totally irrelevant, but it felt good.
