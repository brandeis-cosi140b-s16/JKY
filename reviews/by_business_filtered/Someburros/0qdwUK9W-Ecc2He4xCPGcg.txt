Tried this joint out the other night after driving by the place for a year or so, was pleasantly surprised. It's definitely "gringo" Mexican food, but it was really fresh and tasty. Much better than other gringo-mex places such as Chipotle and Baja Fresh. Its a partial fast food place in that you order at the counter and they bring it to your table on trays, also with a fill your own soda fountain. They have very nice tables and booths, and the place was extremely clean and presentable. Not sure I'll make a habit of frequenting this spot, because I prefer more authentic, spicy mexican food, but this is a good place for folks with mild palettes.
