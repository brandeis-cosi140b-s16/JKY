There's just so much to like about Someburros.  Their tacos are heavenly--crispy on the outside, with juicy shredded chicken or beef on the inside.  Their rod burro is another of my favorites.  It's a huge burro filled with chorizo, beef, refried beans, onions, and chile sauce served enchilada style with melted cheese on top.  If you can't finish this monstrosity of a meal, it heats up well as leftovers.  Their chimichangas are also very good in a similar vein.  They are stuffed with meat, deep-fried, then served with enchilada sauce, guac and sour cream.  If you're a vegetarian, their veggie burro is very flavorful and pretty filling.  I don't know what they put in their refried beans, they're so addictive!   I think the only thing on the menu that I'm not a big fan of is their enchiladas.  They were just so-so, but with all the other food on the menu being so tasty, who needs enchiladas?
