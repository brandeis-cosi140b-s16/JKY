We have been regulars at the Tempe and Chandler Mall Someburros for years.  A family owned restaurant with old family recipes.  You order at the registers then they bring you the food, so it isn't fancy but, it is delicious. The prices are super reasonable and the usually have a daily special.

My kids love the bean burros or chicken taquitos.  I love everything from the big burros, pollo fundido (like the sauce on the side), tacos, tostadas.  My favorite are the refried beans. I am not a big fan of the rice but my kids like it.

At our annual Cookie Exchange with my Tia's we serve the mini-burro platter (red, green and bean).  My family is Mexican-American and they eat the eat them up.
