Really not good.  I don't always trust reviews, but the food was really not good. I am a manager of a business that gets a lot of Yelp reviews, and I always try and give good reviews instead of negative (bad experiences), but this restaurant isn't worth it.  I purchased the pollo fundido and over all it was the worse pollo fundido I have ever had. 

I ordered online, and picked up my order 15 minutes later at the Scottsdale location.  The food was warm at best.  The pollo fundido had VERY processed chicken that was some what questionable and not appetizing.  It is the first time that I have not finished the pollo fundido and through it away.

I had to order a side of chips, and assumed some good salsa would come with it.  Someone else said that their salsa is like hot sauce, and I completely agree. It was honestly a joke. I looked through the 5 small containers, and all of it was the exact same. It was runny, and exactly like hot sauce coming out of a bottle. 

I would recommend Carlos O'briens that is less then 2 miles away.  The cheaper prices at Someburos is not worth it.
