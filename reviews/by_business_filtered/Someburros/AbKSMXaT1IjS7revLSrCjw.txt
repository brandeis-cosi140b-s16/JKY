It had been years since I'd been to this location, and I will not be going back! Called in the order to be a quick pick up, ended up waiting at the window for 15 minutes for the staff trying to figure out how to split the check on two debit cards! Was treated very rudely by staff member Michelle & "manager" Sara, and upon getting home, the food was made incorrectly! Veggie burrito was just a bean and cheese. Thanks for the memories Someburros but your rude staff and inability to get the food right means it will be another 10 years before I give you my business!
