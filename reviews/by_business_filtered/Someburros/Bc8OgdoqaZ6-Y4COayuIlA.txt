Had to come in because I like pollo fundido burritos and since this one had been winning awards and named in best of articles I figured I'd check it out.  Wasn't bad, chicken was moist and I liked both their red and green salsas. But, it wasn't the best one I've ever tried.  I don't even think it's the best in the north part of the valley.  Los Olivos and Valle Luna both have better fundido burritos in my opinion.  I also ordered a carne asada taco.  It tasted good,  but seems overpriced for basically just a street taco.  Restaurant was clean and nice, service was fast.  I'd come again, but I wouldn't plan on any "award winning" fundido.
