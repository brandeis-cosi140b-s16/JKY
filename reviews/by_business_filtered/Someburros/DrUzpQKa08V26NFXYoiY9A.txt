I expected more due to the glowing reviews here on Yelp
I got the Pollo Fundido
It wasn't bad, but certainly wasn't the best Pollo Fundido ever.

I thought the salsa was good, but a little too thin.  I would have liked to have a chunkier option as well.

The ambiance was flourescent and a bit cheesy.

I dunno, I just thought that I'd really be wowed by the food, and I'm a bit disappointed.  Oh well :(
