My son loves Someburros and asks for it at every opportunity.  Probably payback for trying to steer him away from his beloved Taco Bell.  Someburros' food is pretty good, and about the same quality as you'd get at nearby institutions Carlos O'Brien's and Los Olivos.  For no waiter service, though, I'm surprised Someburros' prices are about the same as the others, too.  Someburros is good if you just want a quick bite, but if you have just 10 minutes more, Carlos' is only 2 blocks away and will give you huge portions of the same quality food for about the same price.
