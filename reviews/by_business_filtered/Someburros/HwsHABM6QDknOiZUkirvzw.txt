As a midwestern transplant I have come to appreciate the greatness of having a good taco shop in the neighborhood. I live close to Someburros so it is my go-to place when I need a taco quick.

I've been going to Someburros for quite a while and never had anything that I didn't like. Their tacos are solid, tostadas are good, rice and beans are good - really everything on the menu is worth eating.

But this past weekend I tried a menu item I had not tried before - the beef and potato taco. It's midwest meets southwest and my Minnesota tastebuds were jumping for joy with the first bite. I know it sounds weird to have potatoes in a taco but seriously this thing is awesome. Ground beef with a little bit of taco seasoning, bits of potato, cheese and lettuce stuffed into a hard shell taco - yum!!

This discovery may be dangerous considering the proximity to my house.
