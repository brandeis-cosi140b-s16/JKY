This was a last minute choice when we were in the area. I had never been before and this location had just opened. The inside is very family friendly with new everything. The food just left something to be desired. I thought it was just OK for the price. I ordered a bean burrito and the tortilla tasted a little off--i couldnt put my finger on it. The chips and salsa were great though. The service was also good, lots of high school looking kids, but they were nice.
