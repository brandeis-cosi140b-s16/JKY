I have been to Someburros one other time, Food was just ok. I decided to today to try their breakfast burritos. After waiting for 30 minutes they had forgotten my order and then lied and said that it takes a long time to cook chorizo. She speaks to the cooks in Spanish to make my order and then turns to me and states said that it was not her fault, then whos fault would it be? Blame it on the cooks? Avoid this place! Poor service, awful food and employees who blame others and don't even apologize when they make a mistake. Eek! Me thinks not.
