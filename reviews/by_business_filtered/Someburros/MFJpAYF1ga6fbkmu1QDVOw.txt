Been coming here for many years.  Great red chile and green chile and outstanding fish tacos. I have one complaint. When I come inside to dine, I receive complimentary chips and hot sauce. But, when I go through the drive through,  chips cost extra. Why??? The answer they gave me was that getting free chips is my reward for "joining them inside for a meal". So, I am punished because I didn't eat inside? Ridiculous. Chips and salsa is pretty standard at all Mexican food restaurants in the Valley.  Don't nickel and dime someone because the took their food to go. Still a paying customer. Please fix this policy.
