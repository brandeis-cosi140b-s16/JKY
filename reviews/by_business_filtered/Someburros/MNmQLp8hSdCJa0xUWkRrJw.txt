The menu is loaded with all your usual dishes, tacos, burritos (burros), enchaladas, tostados. After you order and pay, they give you a small paper boat of old, cold, stale chips and a squeeze bottle of red salsa, which I'm guessing is to be used on the cold, dry chips to bring them back to life. I ordered the Carne Asada Burro. It was cold, stiff, dry and lacked any flavor. It had a little bit of bland tasting guacamole, which looked like it was purchased from an outside vendor, and was probably squeezed from a 5 gallon bag. My GF had two street tacos. Same story as above. It looked like the crowd that was dining there was mostly senior citizens.  Not sure why that was or what the relevance is. Just seemed odd. 

Bottom line: Cold food. Tasteless food. Will not be going back.
