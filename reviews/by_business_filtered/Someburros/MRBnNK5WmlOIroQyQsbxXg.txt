I ate at Somburros for dinner around 8:30 or 9:00pm.  The place was not too busy.  It was clean and brightly lit.  I was greeted by a nice young lady behind the counter who too my order.  I had the #1 combo a chicken taco, cheese enchilada, with rice and beans.  With a medium soda the check came to just under $9.  A small tray of tasty chips was included.  Not cheap.  

Mexican food in Tempe has to be great just to stay in business.  There is so much competition.  So my two stars would probably be three in another town, like French Lick Indiana.  It's a real town without many Mexican food places.   

The taco was just ok.  A little on the small side.  The corn tortilla was fried in old oil which gave it a burnt stale taste.  The chicken was tasty, and the lettuce was crisp.  There was a little cheese in there too.  It tasted cheesy.   The enchilada  sauce had a burnt taste and was dark brown.  I'm not an enchilada expert but I've had better.  This cheese enchilada was flat and I could not taste any onions.   The rice and beans were average.    On the bright side the food was hot.  

I didn't find Someburros to be a very good value.  I have had much better tacos and  enchiladas at full service restaurants for less money.   I'm going to keep looking for some great tacos.
