Bean burrito, extra cheese.  Side of rice.  I have dined at Someburros for a huge chunk of my life (15 years?), and only once have I ordered anything different than that which is listed.  They're exceptionally generous with the cheese when ordered like this and the beans have tasted exactly the same (good) throughout the years.  There's a consistency at Someburros that is to be admired, for sure.

I am especially fond of this location on Baseline and Mill in Tempe.  Being a hop, skip, and a jump away from Kiwanis Park, there is little better than a breezy Sunday playing basketball and later venturing a block down the road for some great American Mexican food.
