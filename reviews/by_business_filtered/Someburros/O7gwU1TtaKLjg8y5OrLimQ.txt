This was our first time going to Someburros.  I've heard lots of people talk about it, but until recently had never eaten any of their food.  We recently went to a party where we learned that the party throwers had ordered all of the food from Someburros.  We were loved the hot sauce and decided that we had to go in and get some for ourselves.

We went on Sunday afternoon and only ordered chips and hot sauce to go.  The chips were stale - had to toss them in the oven when we got home.  The hot sauce IS tasty.  

The service is horrible at this place!  The server was annoyed by our questions, was unfriendly and seemed unhappy to be working.  We felt like we were bothering her rather than her being willing to offer up good customer service.  

Despite the close proximity to our home, we won't be going back to this restaurant.  
Rather, we'll be going to Chili's for their bottomless chips and salsa when we want a quick chips and salsa snack fix!
