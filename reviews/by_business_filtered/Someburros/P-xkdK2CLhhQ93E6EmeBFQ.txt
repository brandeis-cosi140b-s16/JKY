Saw the article about the "magical" burrito and decided to finally try this place.  It seems a tad pricey for what seems to be a taco shop, but the employees were friendly and I am guessing by the amount of time it took to receive my order that they are all made to order.  The main issue that I had was I had also gotten 2 chorizo, egg, potato  burritos and added cheese, can't really recall any potatoes, but there sure were A LOT of egg shells in my burrito.  The Fundido burrito was pretty good, better with their hot sauce, and the chicken chimi with red sauce was good.
