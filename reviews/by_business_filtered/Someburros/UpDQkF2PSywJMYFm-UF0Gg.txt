Is it under new management?  We were there yesterday, we walked in, the place was a mess!  The lady cleaning the table I'm sure didn't know what she was doing. There was a young family looking for a table, there wasn't a clean one to be found. They asked 3 times, yes 3 times could we have are table cleaned.  The lady ignored them. Needless to say I was very disappointed. We had to do a take out because there's just no place to eat. Even the food was disappointing.  Enough said, we wouldn't be returning.
