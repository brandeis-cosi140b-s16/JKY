lately I find myself in the area about once a week and had never tried any location of this Arizona chain.  I ordered a combination plate at the counter and found a place to sit.  Being the early part of lunch hour it was almost empty but progressively got busier while I was there.  Place was clean.  The food came out quickly and was tasty.  Both the order taker and the gentleman who brought out my food were pleasant.  I enjoyed my visit and will keep it in the rotation for when I am in the area.
