Just okay fast-food Mexican. It was our first time and we needed a minute to look at the menu & we had questions. We felt rushed to order by the dude at the register and he wasn't helpful at all. I had the taco & tamale meal. The beef on both tasted really overcooked. The best part were the chips-they were really good.
