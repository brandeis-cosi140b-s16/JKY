I promise you.  I.  promise.  you.  These are the best burritos (note: calling a 'burrito' a 'burro' is dumb and only prevalent in PHX) in town.  They are bigger than a baby's arm and have very moist chicken throughout.  The 'Crudo burro' with rice and beans plate is CRIMINALLY INSANE.  Their salsa comes in a squeeze bottle, which i love because of the regulatory physics behind squirting delicious red salsa onto a burrito bite-by-bite.  They also have churros, which is ALWAYS a plus for me because I'm crazy about them for dessert.  Prices are slightly steeper than your typical neighborhood Mexican joint and they DO have a drive-thru, which you must call ahead for, then pick up at the window.
