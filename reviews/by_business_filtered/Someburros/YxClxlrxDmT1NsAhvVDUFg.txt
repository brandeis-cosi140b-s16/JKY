I tried this place twice and wont go go back. I specifically ordered a gren corn tamale and got a red pork one instead which didnt taste very good. When I picked up my food today the enchilada and beans looked like they had been sitting out all day long vs the rice and beans that were made fresh the day before. Very inconsistant and not good at all.
