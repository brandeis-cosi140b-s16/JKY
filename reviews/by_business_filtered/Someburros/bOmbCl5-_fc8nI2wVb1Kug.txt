My husband and I have been looking for good Mexican restaurants since we moved here last year. We have gotten food from here a few times now. There are pros and cons. They have a drive thru which we have used every time to get our food which is nice and convenient. I have only ever had their cheese enchiladas which I do like. My husband likes their taquitos. Their rice is also good. What I don't like about this place is that they charge you for tortilla chips AND they charge you a separate price for salsa (hot sauce)(for to-go orders at least). Perhaps it is because we have only done to-go orders, but the chips have always been cold and in need of a lot of salt, and that is saying a lot for me because I am not a fan of salty food.  I would recommend giving them a try, but if you taking it to go, buy your own bag of chips.
