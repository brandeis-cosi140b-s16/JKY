I waited and waited for this place to open hoping for a good fast food Mexican restaurant.  Boy, was I disappointed.  I ordered the mini chimis with guacamole and rice.  The chimis had meat in them that resembled dog food.  The guacamole was tasteless.  I also got an order of chips and then thought I would try both of their salsas.  The hot sauce (which is what they call their salsa) had a little heat to it, but I would not say that it was HOT.  The chunky salsa, which they described to me as tomatoes with vegetables???, and I said you mean like pico de gallo? and they said yes - it was basically tomatoes in a lot of juice with some onion, jalapinos and cilantro floating in it.  It had more of a taste of green peppers.  Others in my family ordered a beef burrito (that is all it had in it - just beef), a cheese enchilada and a beef enchilada and nachos.  The enchiladas were not the best and the nachos were small tostada shells covered in beans and cheese with some tomatoes on them and then apparently put under a broiler to burn the edged. 

Although I know that this location was completely remodeled, when I walked in, it reminded me of a place from the 80's.  The decor was cheap and old fashioned.

We will not go back to this restaurant.
