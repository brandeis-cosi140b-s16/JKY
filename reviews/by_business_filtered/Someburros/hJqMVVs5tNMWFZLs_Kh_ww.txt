I love mexican food and heard good things about this place...but my husband and I thought it was horrible.  I hate giving such a bad review, but blah.  Maybe we went on an off day.  We ended up throwing our food away, and I am probably the least pickiest person when it comes to food.  The chicken meat tasted like canned tuna.  The only good part was the tortilla chips, which are hard to mess up.  We left and went to in and out burger next door for lunch instead.
