Someburros may be my favorite Mexican place in Tempe. The enchilada I had was very good and the refried beans excellent. The shredded chicken and shredded beef in tacos were very good as well.
My reason for really, really recommending Someburros is the honesty of the staff. After finishing our lunch and trying to manage busing the table and assisting my 91-year-old mother I left my New 32 gig iPad on our table. After realizing my mistake fifteen minutes later and returning to the restaurant a staff person smilingly assured me he had it. So I had a very tasty lunch and my faith in the kindness and honesty in people restored at the same time. Thank You Someburros! You are a great organization.
