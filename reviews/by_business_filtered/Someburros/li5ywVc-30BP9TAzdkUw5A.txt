The one fantastico thing I can say about Someburros is, the hot sauce is wonderful. Otherwise, they aren't very good at getting orders right, and if you try to order something custom, they will immediately become annoyed with you and rude.  My child, like most kids, will only eat very plain items.  I've been going there for some time and have been trying to customize simple orders for her...For example, mini chimis with no toppings, but they still can't ever get it right.  I finally tried to eat there at the restaurant with a family member, and they couldn't even make her the right item she ordered.  So when she told the server that it wasn't what she ordered, the server actually talked her back into taking the item he brought out.  The couple sitting directly next to our table had the exact same problem...ordered one thing, got another.  Adios Someburros!
