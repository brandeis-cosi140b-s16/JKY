Came here on a recommendation to try a red burro. I ordered the red burro and I ordered a machaca as well. The red burro was very good and fresh! The machaca was one is the best I have had. They serve breakfast all day here and the food is not too pricey. I was impressed with the food here and will try carne asada tacos the next time. The location was very busy and they have a drive thru as well. Parking is limited here.  I like this place and will be back again. I highly recommend this place and to try a red burro! You definitely will not be disappointed!
