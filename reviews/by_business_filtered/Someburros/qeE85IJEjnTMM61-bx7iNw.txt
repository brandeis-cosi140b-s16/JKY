I've been going to the Tempe location for quite some time now and just recently made my way to the north location. 

When I first walked in I was impressed with the amount of seating, but then the smell hit me. What is up with the overwhelming sewer smell? No one wants to eat in a place that smells like a sewer.. So we ordered and took refuge on the outside patio. The breakfast burritos were ok, not amazing but better than bertos. Sometimes the service can be a bit slow and when people don't clean up after themselves the place gets pretty messy. 

I would recommend the veggie burro, great fresh pico and big chunks of avocado. I would however order it to go.
