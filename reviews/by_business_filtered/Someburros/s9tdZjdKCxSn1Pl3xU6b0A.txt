Great choice for fast causal Mexican!  Real plates and tasty, and reasonably hot salsa and chips complimentary.  Our to-go place for very reasonably priced Mexican at a place that is great to take kids.  

My wife says most amazing place ever and worth moving to Arizona for.  It's not quite that good, but I for one, benefit from my wife's charitable grading on many things so I don't contradict her here.
