I came here for lunch with a co-worker. It was pretty good. For about $6 I got a burrito and an Horchata, which I think is a pretty good value. But... There is just something about it that was just "Okay."

Pros:
- Burrito was pretty good. It was the Chorizo/Egg breakfast variety.
- They're little packs of complimentary salsa was really good for some reason.

Cons:
- Tastes like other American Mexican Food places--like Macayo's/Arriba's/etc. It just didn't have a "Mexican" taste (maybe I'm being picky here since I eat Mexican food almost every day.)
- CARDINAL SIN: Horchata had a funky after taste. I still drank all of it, but made a face of disappointment afterward.

I might go back, I just wouldn't rave about it to my friends.
