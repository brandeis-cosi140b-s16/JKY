Decided to take a break from Chipotle and check out this local chain. We got a few different burritos and tacos. I'm a sucker for good Mexican and this was pretty darn good. I mean it's semi-fast foodesque, but not so much as Filiberto's. 

I've only had my meals to go, so I can't comment on the dining experience, but the staff has been helpful and I like it when they include lots of sauces! Arrriba!
