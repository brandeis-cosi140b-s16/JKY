Its been over a year since I have had someburros and man I had forgotten how much I really like their red chile sauce, it's the perfect blend of spices and heat!  We had a retirement party at work and Someburros catered the event, there was green chile & red chile mini burros, taquitos and even black bean burros for our veggie lovin friends at work.   It was a great little spread, plenty of chips and hot sauce, sour cream & even guacamole.  

Good job Someburros! It was perfect for the party!
