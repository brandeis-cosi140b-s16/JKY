What a surprise!  I wasn't expecting much can from a place with such a silly name. Rest assured, they do not serve donkey in this place. Lol. 

Shredded beef tacos in crispy tortillas. This is a legit taco!!  The flavors going on in the carne are authentic and outstanding!  The chips?  Delicious!!  The salsas?  Fantastic!!

The service?  Really good!  The cleanliness?  Yes. They have that!  Lol

I only wish this place with a silly name were more conveniently located. I'd eat here all the time!!
