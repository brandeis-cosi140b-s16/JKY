In a town FILLED with awesome Mexican food places... this place is sorely out of it's league! Nothing worse than paying more than you should for what amounts to nothing more than mediocre food. Places like this should always remember that there is never a Taco Bell never far away. 

Was my lunch edible? Sure. Was if good? No. Was I upset I paid $8? Yes!

These guys need to take trip to Filiberto's and see what you get for five bucks. HUGE carne asada burritos... that's what! 

Looking over everyone else reviews, I guess I am going against the grain on this one... but I call it like I see it.

This place was way better when a Krispy Kreme donut stood in its same location. You should walk the extra few feet and eat at In and Out Burger.
