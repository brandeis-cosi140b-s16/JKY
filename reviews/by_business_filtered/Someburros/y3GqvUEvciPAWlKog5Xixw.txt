I'm going to preface this with... I don't like mexican food. But recently, after having some delicious Mexican food, I have been more easily persuaded. So after a hard workout on our way to TJ;s, we stopped off here. This place is awesome.

The food was delicious, the service was great, it was super clean (restrooms included) and did I mention- the food is delicious. When we walked out one of the servers bussing tables even yelled thank you to us, which just seems out of the ordinary for a Fast Casual location.
