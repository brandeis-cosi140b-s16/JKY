pretty darn tasty messican food, and almost fast enough to be called fast food. but this aint' no filiberto's. this place is packed at lunchtime every day of the week.
the tamales are delicious - that's my measure of good mexican food i think... anyone can produce a good bean and chees burrtio, but if you can kill it on a tamale, you know what the eff you're doing!
