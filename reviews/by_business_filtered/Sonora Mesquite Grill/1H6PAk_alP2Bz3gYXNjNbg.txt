I love this place...it is right around the corner from my job and it tastes soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good! Can I just say that everything is so fresh and delicious...the carne asada burrito is AMAZING!!!! You have to get it with the guacamole...they make it fresh and its delicious! They have all different types of salsa that are all great! The chicken salad and the tacos are also phenomenal!  They have raspados too that are great!  They have just done it right and nothing is wrong about this place.
