This place deserves a 4.5 rating. It is really small, and the owner is the only server. However, she is attentive, and the food is received in a timely manner. 

I went with my boyfriend. We shared a barbacoa quesadilla and carne asada tacos. Both were great! Everything is well seasoned, and the guacamole and salsas were homemade and tasty. The horchata is good, but it is a little too sweet.
