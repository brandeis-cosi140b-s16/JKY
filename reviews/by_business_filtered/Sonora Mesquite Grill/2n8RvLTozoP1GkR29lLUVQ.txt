Stopped in yesterday for a 1st time visit.  Had a $16 New Times Voice coupon and really just wanted to see whether or not I agreed with their 2 Best of Phoenix awards (2010, 2011)  on the carne asada.  I was headed to a family cookout, so I opted for 6 carne asada tacos on corn tortillas to go.

Well, I definitely became a believer.  First, the portion was very generous for a $2.50 taco: the soft but sturdy white corn tortilla was about a 6 incher, and it was filled with tender, moist chunks of expertly seasoned beef.  If I had to guess, I would say most likely sirloin tip chunks -- no icky gristle or hunks of fat .  Just enough pico and a little amount of greenery.  Plus key limes cut in half.  Really delicious.  I mean, probably the best I've ever eaten.

Combine that with their 3 delicious salsas, and let's just say that the order was gone in about 2 mins.

Oh, and being a food guy, I don't really pay attention to decor or cleanliness that much, but this place was sparkling.  The floors shined, and the bathroom was spotless and smelled really nice.  It stood out that much to me.

I'll definitely be back and try a combo plate and other items.
