We arrived around 3:30 on a Monday afternoon on our way out of town.  The place was empty (not a busy hour for any restaurant, I realize) and even though we were hesitant to stay because it almost didn't seem like the right place, we ordered tacos, a carne asada burrito and some guacamole.  Everything was amazing.  We wished we would have stopped on the way from the airport on the front end of the trip.  It is easy to drive by it because it is located in a little strip mall, but don't pass on this place.
