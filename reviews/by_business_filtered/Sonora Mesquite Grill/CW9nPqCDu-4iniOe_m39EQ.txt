Barbacoa tacos are unbelievable!  Carne asada is very good, but TRY THE BARBACOA, you will not be disappointed. This was our second visit and we will definitely be going back. Location is odd, but so glad I bought a Groupon to try it out since it is close to work.  The Guacamole Fresca appetizer is also super yummy. The 3 salsas they give you are equally delicious, spicy and very unique.  The owner and daughter(?) are fantastic, service is great!
