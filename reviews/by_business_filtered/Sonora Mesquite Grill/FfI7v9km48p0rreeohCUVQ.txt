Wow that place was unreal. Not much on the inside, but I was looking for good food not entertainment, and that's what I got. Everything I ate was great. The salsa and guac. were different than any I have ever eaten. The Carne Asada was as good as advertised, and to top it off I went with the raspado, which I have never had before. I asked the nice lady that owns the place what flavor she recommended, she made me a pina colada version that I would have eaten until I exploded. It was the perfect end to a perfect meal. I will be back whenever I am in town.
