I ate here yesterday with my in-laws. The place is very well kept and the food was extremely delicious. I had a burrito and the tortilla was very thin (which i much prefer) . After the burrito was made the exterior was grilled  to keep a tight wrap. The sauces are fantastic and I loved the green sauce. It has a nice punch which might be too warm for some  but just right for me. I will definitely be back !
