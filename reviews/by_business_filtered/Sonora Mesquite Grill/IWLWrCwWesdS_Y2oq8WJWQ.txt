We walk in and the lone refrigeration repair guy starts raving about the carne asada, the tea and the rest of the food. And then he professed that he was not family. We ordered carne asada taco combination plates - including spicy rice and brown beans along with guacamole - all outstanding. 

The proprietor - a sweetheart Mexican woman - was truly proud of her cuisine, explaining that the menu was not extensive but all ingredients are completely fresh and the carne is cooked over a mesquite wood fire - along with the chilles and other vegetables for the salsas. 

At one point she explained that the guacamole was served with the pit in the bowl because it helps keep the dish fresh and if you remove the pit away from the mix, it changes the flavor. She also explained that she has to start fresh with the guacamole every half hour - too cool. She was not selling, simple she was proud.

This place is amazing and authentic - go there please so it can thrive.
