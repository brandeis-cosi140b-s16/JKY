Top notch Sonoran style Mexican food.  The carne asada is made by experts from the Mexican state of Sonora.  Trust me, they know what they are doing.   The meat is the appropriate cut and cooked the intended way for authentic taco's you are unlikely to find anywhere this side of the border.  

This is authentic yet modern Mexican food, not the type of swag you normally get in the United States.  I've traveled extensively in Sonora and can say the food at SMG is the real deal.  Entrees include barbacoa, carne asada, chicken tacos, along with staples like quesadillas, beans, rice, fresh gucamole, fresh salsa, etc. I already mentioned the carne asada but it's worth mentioning again...order the carne asada tacos with four tortillas and you will be virtually transported  to the best taco spots in Sonora.  They also have respados, which are a shaved ice treats topped with several home made syrups from mango and pineapple to tamarindo.   Oh one other thing, the tortilla soup is outrageous.  I had some the other day and was blown away at how good it was.  Honestly, it's the best I've ever had.   

The ambiance is pleasant and the place is clean as a whistle.  Several details, especially the lighting and stained concrete floors, create a modern and contemporary feel.  You can tell the owners take great pride in their restaurant and in the quality of the food they serve.  This place easily holds its own against other boutique Mexican food spots and I hope it gets the visits and accolades it deserves.
