Some co-workers brought me here because they know how much I enjoy authentic Mexican food. The Carne Asada burrito may have been the best I have ever had. The perfect amount of cheese, rice and meat. Adding lime juice on top of the food only made the flavor come out more which is always a plus.Tortillas were also delicious. Staff was friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was nice. I will definitely be back.
