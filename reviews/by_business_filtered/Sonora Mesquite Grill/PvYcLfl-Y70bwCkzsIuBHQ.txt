Taco tuesdays never looked so good!
or tasted so good for that matter.
The rumors are true, the hype is justified and the myth is in the making.
SMG is what everyone says, and couldnt be more deserving of all the praises fellow yelpers have heaped onto them; they are ab-fab.
From the second I walked in I was greeted with smiles and warmth, in fact throughout my meal I felt an extreme sense of deja vu, it wasnt until the ride home that I realized that the owner and my grandmother might in fact be long lost twins separated at birth! All kidding aside, the owner is one sweet little lady, talk about customer service oy vay!
The Carne Asada? game over. Hands down the best in the valley.
When I ordered my taco platter I didnt even specify what delicious type of meat I'd wanted, she looked at me, smiled, and knowingly suggested the carne asada, to which I heartily agreed. 
The calibre of the food here is just incredible. So good that it could probably cure rascism. NO.JOKE.
If sheriff joe ate here, he'd probably repent hole-heartedly, doubling down on his knees prostrating himself on the floor and weeping the sorry tears of a man whose seen his folly and begs forgiveness. I would challenge any white supremacist to eat here and say one bad thing about Mexico afterward. Sonora Mesquite Grill is the solution to Arizona's bad rap, sure we can produce ignorant rascist laws like SB-1070, but hey, we also have places like Sonora Mesquite Grill! 
Sonora Mesquite Grill is The Jesus, and nobody fucks with the Jesus.
