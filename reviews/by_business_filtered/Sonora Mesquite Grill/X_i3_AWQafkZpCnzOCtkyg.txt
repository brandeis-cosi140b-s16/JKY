I literally got the plane and came straight here for lunch looking for some real southwestern cuisine. It shows that this place is family owned, the food was great, the salsa fresh and interesting, the service friendly. I had a lot of questions as some of the terminology was different from what I usually see back home (due in large part to mostly chain run places for this kind of food) but they were all patiently answered. This is the place for a quick meal on the run without compromising on quality.
