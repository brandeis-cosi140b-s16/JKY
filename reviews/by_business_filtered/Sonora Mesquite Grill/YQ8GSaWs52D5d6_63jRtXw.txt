Weird location. Near a Chipotle.

Surprisingly good food.  I tried it with a Groupon and they often have a Groupon Now deal too.  i would go again I think.  

There was only one other party there when I went.  Not sure how they stay in business. Maybe lunch is their big time.  I went at dinner time.
