My husband and I flew into Phoenix, AZ on our way to the Grand Canyon.  I found this place via my Groupon app on my phone and since it was 3-4 miles from the airport, we decided to try it out.  What a delicious start to a wonderful trip!  We have been to various parts of Mexico on vacations and such and this is the BEST Mexican food we have both ever had.  We got to the restaurant around 3 pm for a late lunch/early dinner and were greeted by a friendly Hispanic lady who offered suggestions on the various dishes.  I had the two shrimp taco platter and my husband had a chicken burrito.  We were brought out four dinner types of homemade salsas and a dish of delicious, authentic guacamole.  The waitress told us a bit about each salsa, what which pepper was used and how they were roasted.  The flavor was AMAZING!  Beats any chain restaurant, hands down.  Prices were very reasonable (even had I not have been using a Groupon).  We look forward to going back the next time we happen to be in Phoenix.
