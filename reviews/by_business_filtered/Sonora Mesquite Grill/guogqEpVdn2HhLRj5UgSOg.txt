Awesome carne asada burritos, quesadillas and tacos. The quac is fresh and super tasty. The barbacoa tacos are a must especially with a bit of the owners special homemade sauces. Growing up eating this stuff, this place is definately as authentic and fresh as it gets. The owner was wonderful and very attentive. This is now my go to place for authentic quesadillas and tacos when visiting AZ. To compliment the great food and service, the price of it is great. We had a nacho supreme, guac and chips, carne asada quesadilla, carne asada quesadilla platter, carne asada burrito, 3 barbacoa tacos, and 3 horchatas for $53 and every single item blew our mind. :-)
