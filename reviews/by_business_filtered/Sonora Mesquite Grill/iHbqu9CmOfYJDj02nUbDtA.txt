Thanks Yelp for the great option off of 44st and Thomas.  I was meeting my friend for lunch and he works at the Chinese Cultural Center and we were tired of the same old places in the area so we Yelped our options and found this great little hole in the wall place.  It is small but very clean, very good food, and it is a family owned business that makes everything homemade.  Wow, how could you go wrong and how did I let this place slip by without ever eating here.  So I ordered 2 carne asada tacos and 1 chicken (to diversify) and it was fantastic.  I also ordered the guacamole which was OK, they also brought out homemade chips that were phenomenal and they had 3 other salsa choices, green, red, & tomato salsa which all were homemade and tasted awesome.  I will be back for sure, they had desert treats here as well, the menu is small kind of like Chipotle and the service was good but when we came the place only had 3 tables with people.
