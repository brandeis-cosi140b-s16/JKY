This review will be similar to a scolding I might give my kid when he comes home with 5 A's and 1 B.  I know you are doing GREAT, but you CAN improve !!! :)

I can see where all the love comes from.  The food sold here tastes "fresh and home-made" for sure.

But not too much I have had here (and I have eaten there 4 times now) has really made me say, "Wow, this is some of the best food around."

The salsas and guacamole are very good.  

The carne asada does have a very nice taste - however, it's shown a tendency to be a little bit (just the tiny, TINIEST BIT) dry on occasion.

The chips (served room temperature and costing $1.50) are store-bought and not up to par with the rest of the food.

The charro beans are definitely among the top contenders in the Valley.

I'd up this to a 5-star if they'd fry their own chips, or change to a style they can serve warm, and maybe leave some of the juice in the carne asada.

A nice place to eat.  A smidge away from about as fresh as food can taste.
