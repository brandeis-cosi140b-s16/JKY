I brought my mom here for lunch and she LOVED it! I ordered tortilla soup and a fish taco and she ordered a barbacoa burrito with beans and rice on the side. My mom is a fantastic cook and was really impressed with the food here. I let her sample my soup and she said it was the best tortilla soup she's ever tasted. I sampled her barbacoa burrito and my eyes rolled in the back of my head! Way better than Chipotle! I am going to second Georgeann G this restaurant is always empty when I go in and I don't know why because the food is amazing. I might actually cry if this restaurant ever closes. So if you love good Mexican food try Sonora sometime you won't regret it!
