I had the combo platter with carne asada tacos ($7).  In general I thought the food was tastier than most places, but there were several drawbacks.  The selection is very limited:  Burritos, tacos and quesadillas.  That's it.  I was jonesing for a cheese enchilada.  Denied!  Given the reviews, I was expecting the carne asada to knock me over, however I found it tough and somewhat bland and topped with too many raw onions.  Of note too is that the plates and glasses are styrofoam and the utencils are plastic.  Lastly, I've never paid for chips before, they're $1.50 here, although the rest of their prices seem reasonable.  On the bright side everything else was delicious, even the $1.50 chips.
