Friendly bar staff made for a great afternoon luncheon. Nice selection of beer, mixed drinks and wine with a view overlooking Lake Las Vegas.

We had a tostada salad with shredded chicken and a taco platter with one chicken and one carnitas taco complete with rice and black beans.

Not a bad spot in the up and coming section of Lake Las Vegas.
