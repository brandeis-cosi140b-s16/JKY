Nice atmosphere very chill. Stopped here out of the blue. I was at Lake Las Vegas to check out a different place (Brooklyn something) but they where closed at 3pm on 3/16/15. 

I only had drinks at the bar and free chips and salsa. I ordered a house margarita, it was good but they did use a sour of the soda gun. It would be nice to see some fresh juices used.

If I was in the mood for Mexican food I would come back. I do live close to here so that said I don't see people from the west side of town making the trip.
