Chevys in the mall is better than this place. Food was mediocre at best. They charged $.75 for some hot sauce that at least gave some kind of flavor to the food. $85 for dinner for two with two margaritas and an appetizer. Better off eating somewhere else for that price.  Waitress was more interested in BS ing with the folks at another table than taking care of us. Very disappointed. No wonder lake Las Vegas is a ghost town!
