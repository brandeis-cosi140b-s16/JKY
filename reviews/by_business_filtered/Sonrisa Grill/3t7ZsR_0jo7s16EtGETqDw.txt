Sonrisa Grill for many of the locals here in Lake Las Vegas, such as myself, has become a second home.

The staff is great at making you feel like family or there most important customer.  I have met a lot of my neighbors here, as well as a few perspective ones.

If you like Tequila, this is the place to be, with the largest selection I have seen in the US outside of Southern California.

But wait, what about the food?  Sonrisa Grill has an eclectic mix of Mexican/Latin American Cuisine including steak and seafood, with there shrimp and fajita dishes be the most popular. But come hungry because you have to start with one of there amazing appetizers like avocado rolls or calamari. 

There salsa, which is made fresh everyday, is one of the best I have had and I lived in So. California for 38 years. I get an order of cheese dip with the salsa. This goes great with Dos Equis Amber.

In the Spring and Summer I would recommend reservation because this place is always full in the evenings with the patio tables being in high demand with there view of the Lake and entertainment. I sit at the bar and observe the shocked faces of people coming in and are told the wait is 45 mins. It is common for people to think they can get a table easy because they see the rest of The Village being slow. It is quite entertaining to see a stuck up South Shore resident get told they will have to wait.

Friday and Saturday they usually have entertainment.  It is usually a Karaoke band or a Jazz duet.

They have a lot of private parties there as well with special menu items and I always here people raving about the food. You can buy out the restaurant for the evening if you have a big party such as a wedding rehearsal dinner or special event . This happens quite a bit with Sonrisa Grill being next to the Ritz Carlton and from what I have heard the prices are very reasonable for this.
