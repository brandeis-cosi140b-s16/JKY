This place is AWESOME and let me tell you why.  First off they have HAPPY HOUR here.  Drinks are $5, and appetizers are reduced all day on Monday and in the after noons Tuesday through Sunday.  Also, Tuesday is Taco Tuesday all day, REALLY???

$11.95 for ALL YOU CAN EAT TACOS....Did you catch that, ALL YOU CAN EAT TACO's.  

Now these taco's are are not small taco's, they are filling but you can hang out until they close if you want to eat and drink that long....

The House Margaritas and awesome.  Back to the Taco's, they have shredded chicken, shredded beef, Steak and Prawns and all are WOW.

The Prawns were cooked perfect and were some of the best we have ever had and as for the Steak, the seasoning is heavenly.

If you have not been out to Lake Las Vegas, WHY NOT.  This place is worth the drive and worth the price of the food.  They do have other items on the menu all reasonably priced as compared to other places but the atmosphere is unlike anywhere else, this place is a HIDDEN GEM.

We will be back probably on a Tuesday for the All You Can Eat Taco's along with Happy Hour prices on drinks, a DOUBLE WIN!!!

Omar is an AMAZING bartendar and server.  He has an amazing personality and really makes the entire experience worth coming here.
