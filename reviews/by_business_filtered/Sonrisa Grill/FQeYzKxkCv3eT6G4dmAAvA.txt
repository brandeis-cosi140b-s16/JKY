I went during their Happy Hour before the Cocktail Walk at Lake Las Vegas.  House Margaritas were $5 and appetizers were buy one get one half off.  This was a great start to an awesome night.

I went with low expectations based on the poor reviews from yelp.  But maybe this place turned it around because the service was EXCELLENT.  My group took advantage of Happy Hour and had the cheese dip, avocado rolls, and quesadilla.  Everything was really freaking good and they had a great selection of Mexican beers on draft.  I was impressed by the selection of vegetarian entrees.  I ordered the broccoli enchiladas and chile relleno.  The food was fresh and full of flavor. I would totally go back.

So, if you are reading these reviews and are on the fence about trying this place out -  I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant.  The prices are bit high, but if you go during Happy Hour, it is definitely worth the price.
