The food is consistently good. Have had dinner twice so far, ordering different items each time. Good flavor, cooked well, and on Sunday's there is wonderful Sangria to drink as they have "Sangria Sunday" with a lower price on the Sangria.  I highly recommend eating here while visiting Lake Las Vegas..
