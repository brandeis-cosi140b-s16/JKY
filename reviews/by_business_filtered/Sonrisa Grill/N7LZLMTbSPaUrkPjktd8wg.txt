"Where do you want to have lunch?"
"I don't know.  Let me check Yelp."

Boy, I wish I had that particular conversation with my colleagues this afternoon before deciding on Sonrisa Grill.  Instead, we chose Sonrisa pretty much at random, and paid for our mistake.  

As I read the other reviews on Yelp (there was nothing else to do, since the waiter had apparently decided to take a semester off to study flamenco dancing in Barcelona or something), I noticed that many reviewers complained of slow service.  They were right.

I mean, really, really right.  Think glacially slow.  Think the Colorado River carving the Grand Canyon slow.  Even endangered ground sloths would be looking around with a befuddled "What the hell?" look on their little slothy faces.

45 minutes.  45 minutes from when we were seated until the waiter managed to fit us into his busy schedule.  I don't think this is an accurate assessment, however, because one of my companions ACTUALLY FLAGGED DOWN A BUSBOY to ask him to get our waiter for us.

Once he did appear and asked if we were ready to order, it took an additional 30+ minutes to get our food out of the kitchen.  Several of my companions had to leave and we had to take their orders to them in to go containers because they had foolishly thought that an hour and a half was sufficient time to eat lunch.  How silly is that?

The food was typical undistinguished Mexican food (a slice above Taco Bell, but below most Mexican restaurants that don't feature a kid's meal with a toy).  

In short, don't plan on anything else if you lunch at the Sonrisa Grill.  You will be there until the dinner hour...
