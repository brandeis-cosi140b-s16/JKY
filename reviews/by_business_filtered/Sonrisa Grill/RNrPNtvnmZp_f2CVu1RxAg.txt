Came here on Valentine's Day. We arrived around 5 before the rush and was immediately sat on the patio. The female hostess only brought 1 menu for 3 of us. It was a special Vday menu with only about 10 items. After asking for another menu and waiting we finally ordered. 
Then the wait begins! It took almost 40 minutes for our appetizers to arrive.  Cheese Dip and Guac. Then we had to ask for refills of chips and drinks. Our waiter apologized and said the Kitchen was backed up. We noticed he was busy running back to the kitchen all the time. NOT really sure how a kitchen could be backed up with a limited menu and we arrived before the rush. They were getting busy as we left. 
So after an hour and 20 minutes our fajitas arrived. The chicken was good. Nothing special and the beans and rice on a separate plate was cold. It wasn't served with any Sour Cream or Guac?? I'm giving 3 stars because the ambience. It was a gorgeous night. They had a guitar player and the patio is great.  They really need to step up their game to be "it" place that I would want to drive to.
