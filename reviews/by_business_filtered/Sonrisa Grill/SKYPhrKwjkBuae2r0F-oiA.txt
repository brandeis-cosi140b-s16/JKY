We went to Sonrisa with another couple and their daughter and were looking forward to some good Mexican food.  

First, the service was horrible.  We ran out of chips and water and were refilled only once.  The food was not great either, no where near the quality I anticipated.  

The salsa tasted like tomato paste and my daughter's french fries were cold (she's 3).  I had a taco and chili relleno.  The taco tasted fine, but the chili was very eggy and had an extraordinarily small chili hidden somewhere within.  The rice and beans were decent.

The atmosphere was great on the patio thanks to a jazz band (nearby) and fireworks which were rescheduled from the 4th of July.  

Finally, they have a policy that states for a party of 6 or more there would be an 18% tip automatically applied to the check. It was insult to injury since we had bad service, poor food, and 2 of the people in our party were 3 year olds.  And neither of the toddlers left even left a mess!

I won't return.
