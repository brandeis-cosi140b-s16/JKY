I had family visiting from Az that were staying at the Westin Lake Las Vegas after deciding to do the wine walk Sonrisa Grill was recommend to us by one of the staff that worked in the casino.

When we got to the restaurant we were seated after only a few minutes of waiting, once we sat our waiter promptly greeted us and took our drink order. Shortly thereafter he returned and took our food order, my sister and I ordered the Shrimp a la Diablo we were told it was spicy, upon getting our entrees I took a bite of one of the shrimp and "HOLY CRAP" that stuff was HOT!! 

My sister did fine with hers but I could not bear the hotness, I'm talking burning your ears hot! So I called the waiter over and told him that I couldn't eat the dish and that I would like to order another entree upon returning to our table he leaves a DRINK menu. It took about 10 minutes for someone to return to our table with a full menu, but it wasn't our server it was a waitress and as she approached our table she had the menu open and before I could say a word she said "YOU ORDERED THE SHRIMP A LA DIABLO IT'S SPICY" I replied that it was too hot for me and I would like to order something else she replied with " THAT'S FINE BUT I STILL HAVE TO CHARGE YOU FOR THE ENTREE, DO YOU WANT ME TO PUT IT IN A BOX FOR YOU???? WTF?????

I was so irritated and hungry at this point we said fine I placed a new food order, but by this time the other three people I was with had already finished their meals, the waitress says to me "IT'LL BE ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, BUT ABOUT 20 MINUTES LATER MY FOOD FINALLY CAME AND IT ARRIVED IN A TO GO BOX!! Which further annoyed me.

So here I sit eating dinner with three other diners that were all waiting for me to finish my meal which was being eaten out of a to go box and plastic ware. The waiter comes back and says "OH I MESSED UP THAT WAS A TO GO ORDER, BUT I'LL HAVE YOUR PLATE OUT IN A FEW MINUTES AND AS HE WALKED AWAY HE SAYS, IM BLONDE...WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?!? Again...WTF???

By this time our whole party was over this dining experience, we ended up waiting for about another 15 minutes to get the check despite the fact that our waiter and the waitress who had taken my second order had walked by several times. 

I may have considered returning to this restaurant despite their terrible service because of the mango margaritas, BUT DUE TO THE FACT THAT THEY MADE ME PAY FOR ANOTHER ENTREE after tasting my dish and it being too hot I will never return nor recommend, in fact I will DISSUADE anyone from dining here.
