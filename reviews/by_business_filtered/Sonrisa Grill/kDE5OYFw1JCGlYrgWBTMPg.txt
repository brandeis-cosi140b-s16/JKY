Camarones were excellent-garlic sauce incredible - thanks for the recondition - Logan our server. Chile Relleno was delicious. Not too saucy. Margaritas were comped as part of this check in - of course we upgraded to Cadillac for just a bit more. Prices are a bit high but it is a resort so not too bad. I would come back for sure.  Service was great and we had a lake view.
