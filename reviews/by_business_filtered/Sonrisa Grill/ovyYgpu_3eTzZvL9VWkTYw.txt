This is a two-part review.

Part 1 - we were staying at the Loews down the street and the only thing close was the village.  We decided to give it a go.  The place was dead, like Stepford dead, but we decided Mexican was a great idea.  I was a big fan.  The place was nearly empty, but our server was really cool, the food was solid and they had an awesome brown ale.  Yum.

Part 2 - cut to a few days later...a Saturday night.  Nice day and I was still craving that delicious brown ale so we ventured to the patio at Sonrisa.  It was packed.  Strike one was my beer arriving 2/3 full.  When our food finally arrived, after a LONG wait, I noticed that my burrito had a brown mark on it, I thought it was toasted cheese.  I later came to realize that they must have nuked my meal before it came out because they actually managed to char the sauce on my burrito (still don't know how you do that), my rice was served extra crispy and the beans had that overcooked film on top.  Not good.  That deserves two strikes.

So anyway, if you're stuck at the Loews, you should rent a car and get out of the resort.  If you can't, go on a weekday when the kitchen has less than 10 people to serve.
