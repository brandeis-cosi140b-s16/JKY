I can't say enough about this place.  I felt compelled to write a review immediately.....I'm still sitting on their patio digesting. LOL.  The salsa and guacamole are super fresh and delicious.  The sangria (red) is delicious.  Every bit as good as our favorite from Milo's Wine Cellar in Boulder City .  I had the steak and chicken fajita and it was outstanding. My wife had the skirt steak and it was tender and seasoned perfectly.  The staff was very friendly and engaging. Chris, the GM, took time to chat with us at length and made us feel very welcome. We highly recommend this place.  Lindo Michocan used to be my go to Mexican restaurant.  Not any longer.
