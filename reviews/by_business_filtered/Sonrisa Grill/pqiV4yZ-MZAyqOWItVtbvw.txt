What an amazing experience! We had a large party of about 20ish, Chris was our server and he was incredible! Chanthy the owner came out to greet us and make sure everything was up to par. It was a bit chilly out, so they brought out the standing heaters to accommodate us and make sure we were A-OK! 
The restaurant is upscale casual, beautifully decorated (I especially love the fountain in the center of the main dining room & the stained flooring), and it's right next to the lake. Sit outdoors on the patio if you can, very romanitcal.  The food is great, guacamole off the app menu is right up my alley! All in all, we loved our experience and will DEFINITELY go back.
Park on the 4th floor of The Hilton's parking garage and walk down the breeze way.
