First off service wasn't that great. 
2nd we weren't done with our appetizer and a random worker came and cleared our table. I told him we weren't done and he just said sorry ! I was annoyed already. Then I show them the "yelp check in" it says free house margarita for each adult 21+ he brings back 1 when there was 2 . Took our server 20 min to come back and take out order and still had the nerve to ask if we needed more time lol.... Bartender was my fav . (Husband had to go to bar to order) SAD . other then all that lol... Food was ok. Kinda plain. Chicken flautas were good though .
