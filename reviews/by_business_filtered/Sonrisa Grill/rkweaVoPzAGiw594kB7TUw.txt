Some places only deserve one star. You found one of them! My friend said it used to be a lot better. It was hot as hell in there. My friend's legs got stuck to the booth's fabric. I've never experienced worse service. The taco hardly had any meat in it, burrito was small, and the service was soooo slow. The waiting area is so small so as people are waiting, they cram in the doorway, propping the door open. Also worth noting, if you make reservations at lets say 7, you will most likely be seated at 7:15-7:20. You are better off looking for a better restaurant at LLV.
