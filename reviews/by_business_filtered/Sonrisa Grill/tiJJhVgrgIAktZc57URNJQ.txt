Excellent service from the moment we walked in. Salsa & warm chips appeared almost instantly. Staff were uniformly polite and upbeat. 

The warm chips took me aback a smidge at how different and irresistible they were. 

My appetizer (avocado & bacon wrap) was just the right warmth and tastiness.

The chili rellenos main dish was more doughy,  less chili than I've had elsewhere, maybe not the highlight of my meal, but still delicious. I ate it all up.

My vegetarian wife commented on how vegetarian burritos are often filled only with lettuce and onions, whereas her's was filled with a cornucopia of seasoned vegetables. This pleased her. 

She would definitely come back, and so would I.
