Waited 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged that we were waiting to be seated.  Finally got a seat outside - which is beautiful.  Fun festive lights - great view.  We were a party of 6 - and the hostess said I only have 3 menus - ill bring you more later - she never came back.  We asked a bus person for extra menus - he came back 10 minutes later.  We got quick service for our drink order - but got serverd in styrafome cups...really?? I looked around and there were some  tables with glasss - and some with styrafome like us.  Took a looooong time to get our food - 45 minutes.  After the food arrived -  the hostess comes back with extra menus - ?? Couldnt she see we had food at our table??  I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs. We had a mexican salad - which was horrible - just shredded lettuce - with nothing mexican about it.  Got our bill - and they had the nerve to actualy charge an automatic 18% gratuity because we were a party of 6.  Never again!!!
