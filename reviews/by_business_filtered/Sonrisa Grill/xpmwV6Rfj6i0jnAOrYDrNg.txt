Ok seriously LLV, wth are you smoking... this place is mexcellent.

Victor was over the top hospitable.  He let us sample one of the soups that they'll be rolling out on their upcoming lunch soup menu.  It was a delicious Mexican spin on traditional chicken soup.  A citrus note along with the standard cilantro made the soup wonderfully refreshing while still maintaining a nice hearty feel with large chicken pieces that, get this, were incredibly tender - not the dried out, tough, flavorless bites usually found in chicken soup.  The vegetables in the soup also had a nice crispness and weren't all mushy.

The margaritas are dangerously delicious.  So smooth, yet so potent!  You can just barely tell that they have a heavy hand with the tequila because the citrus mixture they create is so perfect - just enough tang and tart without the sickening sweetness.  The pitchers are enormous, but it's scary how quickly you can drain one!

The queso dip is absolutely phenomenal.  I love the small amount of cooked spinach in it that makes me feel like I can write it off as "healthy" - ha!  The guacamole is good and very fresh, but not really a star.  The two standout entrees at our table were by far the Pescado A la Veracruzana (with Halibut) and the Camaraones al Mojo de Ajo.  The sauce on both dishes was good enough to warrant licking the plate.
