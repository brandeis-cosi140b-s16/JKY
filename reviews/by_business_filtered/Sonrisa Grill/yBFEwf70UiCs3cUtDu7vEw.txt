One of the worst experiences. The place is busy because is 1 out only 3 places that serve food at the Lake. Our experience: 
The hostess walked us to our table and they had not cleaned it prior to our arrival. After being seated and more than half an hour later, we were forgotten; no one came to take our orders or gave us water. I had to ask for someone to take our order. When we got our drinks, all the glasses were not washed appropriately; they had water stains, fiber hairs all over, and stains on the exterior part from being handle with dirty hands. The food was good, but I got a stomach ache after seeing an insect in between my rice. To top it off when I got my check, I almost fell back. They are over priced. When I went to the bathroom, I noticed their cleaning supplies were under the sink in plain view. I couldn't help thinking- this is dangerous. Specially because there are a lot of kids that can get harmed by this. 

I believe this place has potential, but they need to get their shit together.
