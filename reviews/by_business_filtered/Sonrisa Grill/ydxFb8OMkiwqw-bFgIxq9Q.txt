Have been here twice once for a normal dinner, and that went so well that I decided to have a Board Retreat at the same venue!  If you are going for a Margarita, La Jefa is definitely the way to go - they are amazing!  If you get the Queso, ask for it spicy - it's delish!  We rented out the patio area on the second time for a group of 65 people and had a blast.  It was during slightly windy evening, but the fire pit and heat lamps were perfect.  Chris, the onsite Event Planner was fantastic to work with and very accommodating.  The staff was fun and always had great recommendations for tequila.
