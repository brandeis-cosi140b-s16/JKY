Ok, so where to start. The wait staff seemed confused to just get us seated. There was just a wait for everything. Wait to order drinks, wait for the drinks, wait to order food, wait forever to get food, wait for someone to pickup dishes, wait for a beer, wait for the check. The food was subpar at best by the time the food arrived I could tell that it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while considering that the beans and rice were kinda crusty. Thanks no thanks
