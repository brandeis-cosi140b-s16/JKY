Slow service, even with few patrons. The food was alright. Atmosphere was nice, except for all of the 4th of July shoved underneath credenzas ( a week after the celebration) HINT: If you do not have the space to store it....try a table cloth. This is my second time here. It has not really improved. I usually like to try things at least 3 times, before I officially make a decision, so I MIGHT take another shot at this place, but....I have to be honest, unless this place really knocks my socks off....and I am talking a virtual party in my mouth, I just cannot recommend this place. There are far more deserving eateries within the Lake Las Vegas community that really know how to treat their customers.
