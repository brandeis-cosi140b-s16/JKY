Still love Spotted Donkey just as much and had such a nice dinner there the other night, I thought I'd update. My boyfriend and I usually head up there when we're in an eating mood. I'm also glad we can sit outside on the patio now with the cooler weather. 

We've created our "perfect" order and order the same every time... never fails to impress. We have Silver Coin margaritas and guacamole to start... I add a touch of salt and lime to the guac. Then we share the pork tenderloin over their green chili mac and cheese (amazing sauces!) and their beef fajitas (love the seasoning!). The fajitas include beef, sausage, bell peppers, onions, and tomatoes. It's a lot of food, but it's worth it!
