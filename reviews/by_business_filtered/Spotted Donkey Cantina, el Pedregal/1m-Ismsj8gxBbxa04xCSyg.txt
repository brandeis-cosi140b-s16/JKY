On our way out of the Scottsdale area and back to the airport to leave AZ (goodbye sun and warmth) we stopped at the Spotted Donkey Cantina as my friend and her family told us it was (and is) one of their favorite spots.

It would be our second day in a row eating Mexican food, but I wasn't upset about that.  I know there is good Mexican in AZ and soaking up as much of that as possible was never going to be a bad thing.

We started our meal out with the Donkey Nachos (short is $9.95, Regular is $14.95).  Our server suggested the short.  We are happy he did as this dish was still quite large.  These are not your typical nachos.  They definitely are doing something different with this dish.  La casa fried corn tortilla rounds, pulled pork, serrano chile roasted tomatoes, tomatillo salsa, cheddar and monterey jack cheeses queso fresco, black beans and mexican cr√©ma.  That is a mouthful and this dish was a mouthful.

Ended up doing some more sharing for this meal too.  That is fine by me as I can certainly eat my fair share and always nice to cut back on the portions.  For our main we had the Pollo en Mole Poblano ($15.95).  Oven roasted chicken breast, roasted plantains, chef Esteban signature mole sauce spanish rice with corn or flour tortillas.  Another very reasonable portion.  The chicken was a bit on the dry side, but the mole was very good.  It certainly helped as the dish was not lacking in mole at all.  It needed it.

All and all a nice place to occupy yourself for a couple of hours.  We were able to sit on the patio.  During this time of year it is just silly to sit inside when the weather is just about perfect here.
