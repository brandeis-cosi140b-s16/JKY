Spotted Donkey may be hidden in a resort/strip mall, but it stands out. The food is always high quality, fresh, and satisfying. We love the Mexican-style meatloaf and the enchiladas. 

One caveat--lactose intolerant folks beware, they love their cheese here! Ask for your dishes with light or no cheese. For the cheesy people like me, this is a plus!
