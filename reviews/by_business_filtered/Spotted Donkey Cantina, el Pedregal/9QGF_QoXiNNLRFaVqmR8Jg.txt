Wow. Ate here while staying at the Boulders. Great food. Everything we ate was amazing. Food was on the spicy side which I enjoyed! House margarita was one of the best I've had,Very fresh! I highly recommend the pulled pork sandwich on the pretzel bun. We were here during off season do there was no wait.
