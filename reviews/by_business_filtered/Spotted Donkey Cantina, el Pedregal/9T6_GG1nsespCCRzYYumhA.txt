Spotted Donkey is definitely a bit pricey and out of the way for your average outing, but it is totally worth it for those special occasions. My wife has tried Baja fish tacos at dozens of restaurant, street vendors and food trucks over the years, but for her birthday yesterday she wanted the one she ranks higher than all others: the ones at Spotted Donkey. Like every time before, the food was amazing, although I inexplicably chickend out (pollo'd out?) and got a burger. It was really good but I regret wasting the opportunity to try something truly memorable there. Learn from my mistake. I have. We will going back next month for my bday!
