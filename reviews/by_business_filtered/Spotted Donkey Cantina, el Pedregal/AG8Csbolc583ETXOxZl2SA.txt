The restaurant was curiously empty when we went at 7:00 on a Sunday night.  When we got our food I knew why!  The special, pulled pork and green chilli stew was greasy and had more potatoes than either pork or green chillis.  The enchiladas were marginally edible.   The final insult was when we were charged 7.50 for chips and salsas .  The chips were good, the only good thing about this meal.  This used to be a great restaurant but obviously something has changed.  Take a pass on this one.
