We went to the spotted donkey for a late lunch.  Service was good,we were seated right away.  We ordered taquitos, one of the appetizers, and it was outstanding.  My friend got chicken enchiladas for lunch and it was nothing to write home about.  I ordered the veggie cheese crisp and it was good.  I will go back but I will try something a little more adventurous than our usual standbys.
