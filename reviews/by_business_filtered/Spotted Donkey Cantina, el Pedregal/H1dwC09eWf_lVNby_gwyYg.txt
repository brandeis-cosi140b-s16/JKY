Stopped here tonight on a whim and quite happy about it, but the wallet's much lighter.

Hubby had:
The Spotted Donkey "Chop" Salad
A tableside presentation of chopped romaine, roasted corn, cucumber, blue cheese, cilantro, warm smoked bacon and avocado all tossed together with jalapeno buttermilk dressing, crispy flour tortillas $12.50

It was really good, the flour tortillas was my favorite part of the meal!  They toss it for you at the table.

*Big Ol' Jack Ass Angus Burger  with double cheddar cheese, grilled sweet onion, avocado, jalapenos and horseradish mustard. Served with housemade fries $12.50 

Wonderful!  The fries were fresh and hot with the skin on.  The burger was fat and cooked perfectly.  The bun was not bought at Sam's Club!

Warm Flourless Chocolate Fudge Cake with Roasted Coconut and Raspberry Sauce  $9.00

We've had flourless chocolate cakes before and love them, but this one took us for a spin- it had grill marks on it!  Unusual and delicious!

I had:

Watercress Jicama, Orange and Avocado Salad with toasted pumpkin seed vinaigrette $11.00

Nice and fresh, but $11 bones is a lot for this girly salad.

Arizona "Mac and Cheese"
Rigatoni pasta with hatch green chile, Mexican cheeses and applewood smoked bacon $12.50

If you like the mac & cheese from Z Tejas, you will love this!  Very rich, but a little too simple for a main dish.  Get this and share another dish with your date and you'll be happy.

Fried Banana Wraps with Mexican Chocolate Sauce with whipped cream  $9.00

Nice presentation, perfectly ripened bananas in nice flour tortilla and fried.  I had cinnamon ice cream with it but was envious of my hubby's vanilla and that NEVER happens!

Beautiful setting, nice place for out of town guests!
