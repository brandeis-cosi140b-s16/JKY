Some Friends drag me back to this place, I am kicking and screaming because my previous visits have all been bad. I remain baffled at the appeal of this place, where their over salted, flat tasting, premade sauced food is difficult to eat. The chips and salsa remain the staple here. But no one goes out for dinner just for chips and salsa, now do they? If the margaritas were good, we could make an argument that this would be a good place to hang out for drinks. Unfortunately, the margaritas are sickeningly sweet and weak to boot. Ordering side shots, and pouring those into the drinks helped, but turned already expensive drinks into monstrously expensive drinks. The bartenders here, without fail, exhibit no personality, but simply act as if they are working for a resort restaurant which this place is.  No one here seems happy, but simply want to be left a huge tip from the upscale clientele that frequent this place. I cannot think of a more disappointing place to bring guests, unless you sit outside on the patio, which is very nice, and your guests don't notice the bad food and the bad drinks.
