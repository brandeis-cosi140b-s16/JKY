Very helpful and nice staff

We started with the nachos with pulled pork (you might think its a bit pricey for nachos, but damn.... you get a lot of food... and its good.)

A friend ordered the Calamari... and even though I am allergic, I had to try a few pieces... it was alright...........she said she had ordered it in the past and since then she says they changed the breading and they don't deep fry it anymore. Thus it is not as good as it used to be. The smoked jalapeno dipping sauce was really good though. 

The Pulled Beef Barbeque Sandwich and The Beef Enchiladas were a treat.... I really like this place. Nice location and decor also. Plus they have cute donkey pictures :)
