My husband and I went here looking for a new  lunch choice.  We were seated promptly and greeted by our waitress.  She wasted no time asking us what kind of Margarita we would like, this, at 11:40 AM.  After declining, we reviewed the menu to find it did not include a lunch section.  The entrees were pricey, averaging about $15.00, so I decide to order an appetizer as my meal.  The description of the panko coated calamari sounded to be the perfect choice.  When the waitress returned she immediately asked us which appetizers we would be ordering before the meal.  The "bulk up the bill" tactic was getting obvious.  We placed our order and then attempted to do what we always do while dining...talk.  Unfortunately the "honky tonk" music was so loud that we couldn't hear ourselves think.  I asked the waitress if this was the music that they normally played since it was supposed to be a Mexican restaurant.  She replied that it was and that even though they themselves didn't like it, Corporate would not make a change.  Okay...so then our food came. My husband had the chicken enchiladas which were fine but nothing special.  Then came my $12.50 dish.  The "calamari" turned out to be long logs of calamari loaf, fried in a heavy, greasy breading.  The two accompanying dipping sauces may have been okay but couldn't be distinguished from the overwhelming distaste of the logs.  After all was said and done, the waitress asked us if we were ready for dessert.  Needless to say, we weren't.
