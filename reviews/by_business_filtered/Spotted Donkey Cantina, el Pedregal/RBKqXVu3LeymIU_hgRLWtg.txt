The Spotted Donkey makes the drive to North Scottsdale worth it. The restaurant provides a Southwestern filled fun experience! The vibe here is trendy Mexican with colorful walls, wooden furniture and enjoyable music. Large enough to seat a party of ten or quaint enough to seat a party of two, I enjoy coming here for any occasion. 

When the weather's nice, it's ideal to sit on the patio and enjoy the evening with some margaritas and tasty guacamole to start.  My favorite dish is the stuffed peppers which are poblano chiles filled with roasted pork, cheddar-jack cheese and Spanish rice, in a fresh basil tomato sauce. It's a hefty meal but tastes so good that it's hard not to finish each and every bite of it. I choose one of their homemade margaritas to wash it down and if it's a really exciting night, I'll have the queso in addition to the guacamole for starters. I choose this restaurant when I'm looking for a hearty Mexican meal with the feel of the true southwest. 

As I mentioned, I absolutely love the environment at the Spotted Donkey. Making its home on the second floor of Pedregal, I can see the rock formations lingering over the buildings and the desert breeze is crisp and refreshing since we are away from the city. It's a fun experience and I always try to find an excuse to make the drive north so I can make a visit to the Spotted Donkey.
