Where did the famous donkey from the movie "Shrek" go when he retired?  He took those royalty checks and invested them in a very tasty Mexican restaurant called "The Spotted Donkey" in Carefree, AZ. (Disclaimer--I am joking about the Shrek donkey, although I bet he comes here for dinner)!  We were fortunate to have reserved a Friday night table early, as those before us who came to see the hostess without reservations looking morose and ended up checking their smartphones for other dining options.

Our waiter was attentive and helpful, explaining that the enchiladas in mole sauce had gone off the menu about 6 months earlier, due to a general lack of popularity.  While this did not give us much cause for optimism for the palates of the restaurant's clientele, our waiter assured us there were other tasty options on the menu.

We made an investment in an expensive appetizer, chips with homemade guacamole.  My stocks should pay these kind of dividends--it was delicious.  For dinner items, my bride ordered a burro with steak and shrimp.  She could only make her way through half of it before waving the white flag.  I ordered two machaca chicken enchiladas, smothered in red and green chili sauces, with sides of rice and beans.  Again, these were far superior to what you would procure at a chain restaurant.  Dessert?  You have got to be kidding!

I recommend this to everyone, but do not show up at dinnertime without reservations!  Otherwise you will be spending an excessive amount of time sipping one of the Spotted Donkey's tasty margaritas.
