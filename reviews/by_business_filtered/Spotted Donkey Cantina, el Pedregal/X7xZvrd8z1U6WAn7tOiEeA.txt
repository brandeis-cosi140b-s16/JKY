I stumbled upon the Spotted Donkey by accident. I thought it was the other restaurant that used to be at El Pedegral (now closed). Lucky mistake I made! 

I've been there a couple times since then and have loved every dish! Keep in mind I grew up near Mexico and lived there briefly, so I have a very selective taste for Mexican-inspired food. The guacamole is above average, but not the best I've ever had. The salsa is nothing special. They main dishes are the standouts here. My favorites: "Silver Coin" margaritas...  they are phenomenal! I'd imagine they're made with fresh lime juice and a simple syrup instead of a sweet 'n' sour mix. The beef fajitas are perfectly seasoned and are quite a feast, so order them if you have a big appetite. The signature tacos are also quite delicious. My favorite by far has been the pork tenderloin over their green chili mac and cheese is amazing. Great combo of flavors - one of my favorite dishes around town!   

We've never had enough room for dessert, so I can't offer a review on that. I strongly recommend Spotted Donkey. I'm going to introduce some friends to it this weekend and enjoy this nice weather on their outside patio.
