Been here a few times - meals have always been great - love their happy hour.  Great patio to sit outside when the weather is nice and enjoy the view.  Service is always fantastic.  

However... I have to mention my fajitas the other night... O M G ... I don't consider myself an expert on proper fajitas ... I just know when they're done wrong - they're really wrong.  These were incredibly delicious!  I shared a SMALL taste with my dining companion.... he agreed that they were awesome!  I don't know what they did .. but I do promise - I'll be back again and again and again.

Headed over tonight to a 4 course meal and tasting hosted by Herradura Tequila... I can't wait!
