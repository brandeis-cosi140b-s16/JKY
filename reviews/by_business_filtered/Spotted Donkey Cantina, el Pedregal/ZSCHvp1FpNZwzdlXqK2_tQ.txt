Nothing could be better than downing a margarita, moon-side on a warm night outside at the Spotted Donkey. 

Prompt. Knowledgeable. Delicious. 

I'm always hesitant eating at Mexican restaurants where the plates are strikingly beautiful and they've some how made sour cream look like an art form -- I never saw this in my travels throughout Mexico. 

Anyway, the food was wickedly delicious. Spicy, flavorful and bold -- perfection combination on a plate. I'd definitely order the guac, ceviche and fajitas. 

Even when it is 130 degrees, I'd probably still eat their hotness.
