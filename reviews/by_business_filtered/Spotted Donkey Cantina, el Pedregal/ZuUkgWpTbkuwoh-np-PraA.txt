I am a fan of mexican food and this place has some good chow downs.  I like when restaurants give you so much food that you can go home and enjoy the food later.  This place offers that.

The service was great and the cheese caso with tortilla chips was amazing.  The food was pretty good as well. I had chicken enchiladas and an awesome margarita that was purple. 

Good for groups of 2-6

It's a great place for people you have out of town guests in and live in the area or a fun spot for a nice evening out on a date.  I came from tempe so the drive was a shlep but I was not disappointed by the food and the company.  

Recommendation: To anyone who enjoys mexican food as much as I do,  make sure you pack an extra stomach when going, and don't plan on doing anything after-words except lying on the couch
