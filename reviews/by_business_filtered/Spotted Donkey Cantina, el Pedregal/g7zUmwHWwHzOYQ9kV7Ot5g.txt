Took my mother-in-law with the family for a
Birthday brunch here last year. Beautiful drive up Scottsdale road to El
Pedrigal. Upscales shops, and entertainment in the courtyard. We sat on the
patio, with great views of the Boulders, and listened to the acoustic
guitarist in the courtyard of the shopping center. Super atmosphere.
The restaurant itself has a modern southwestern vibe that's perfect for a
more sophisticated crowd. Creative, mexican menu with great margaritas,
guacamole and poppers. My mother in law had the shrimp Caesar salad and
loved it.
A client introduced me to this on in El Pedrigal about 5 years ago. We find ourselves now going to the one on Hayden and Via De Ventura in Scottsdale since it is right by our office.
