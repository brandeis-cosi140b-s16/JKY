Ate here last year and it was over priced. Decided to try again this year. Arrived at 5:30 to an empty restaurant and patio only to be told they had no openings and the to have the hostess take a phone call right in the middle of our discussion.  So we just walked out.  We will never be back.  Would give zero stars if i could.
