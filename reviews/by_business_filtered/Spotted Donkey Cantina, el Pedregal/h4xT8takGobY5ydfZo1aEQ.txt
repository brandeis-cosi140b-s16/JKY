The Spotted Donkey is always good food, creative selections with a nice atmosphere and attentive service - Last night's visit was no different and the New Mexican green chilli meatloaf was a very pleasant surprise - I almost always get the Jalapeno shooters as well as the guacamole and am never disappointed. They weren't too keen on handing us the restaurant week menu which I never understand - Its a promotion of the food and brings new and regular customers to the business - take the hit, offer it to me and I will likely be back. At Flemings if you request tthe restaurant week menu, you will likely be ignored for the rest of the evening. Not so here, so I got over it. A couple of tasty margarita's helped..
