(Review for the Scottsdale Road location)

The Spotted Donkey is a semi-upscale Mexican restaurant with absolutely delicious food and great-tasting drinks (especially the signature margaritas). I really like the atmostphere and decor -- you can go in jeans or make it a lovely date night. 

The only thing that's holding me back from four stars is the price. I'll admit - I'm a bit of a cheapskate, so the prices might not bother you as much. But here's an example of something I find a bit over the top. They offer a delicious tableside chopped salad for lunch. However, it comes with bacon. Want to add chicken or shrimp (hey, even offer to substitute for the bacon if I'm feeling especially diet-conscious?) -- the salad now becomes nearly $15. For a salad. For lunch.

Again, I know this is Scottsdale and the Spotted Donkey is a bit more upscale than, say, Zipps around the corner. So, definitely go there. (I have paid for this expensive salad more than once, and I probably will again.) Just be prepared to spend a bit more than your average lunch/dinner/happy hour.
