Cant say enough about this place!!! the food is excellant so is the service!! Greg was probably the best server i have ever had, every recommendation he had was spot on!!!. I had the bbq braised beef on a pretzel roll and it was sooooo good! My boyfriend had the Baja fish tacos and he said they were great!! overall a great experience!! The Horseshoe margarita is a must try! It was also great to see that they support the local beers!! you will find me back there very soon!!!!!
