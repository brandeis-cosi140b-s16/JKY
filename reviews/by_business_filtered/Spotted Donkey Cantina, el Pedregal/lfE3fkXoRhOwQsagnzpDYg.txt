We just moved here and had a family-from out of town- dinner here.  We are searching and trying to find some favorite restaurants.  Spotted Donkey is a great space, open and well decorated.  They sat us at an uncomfortable table for 5, but I think there are no good tables for 5.  

The waiter started to ask about drinks and responded to an innocent question about types of tequila with a 7 minute monologue about the special tequilas they buy and how awesome the margaritas are.  It was 7 minutes more about tequila than I really wanted to know.  Especially since the margaritas ended up being inconsistent from one drink to the next.  Other than the tequila rant, the service was outstanding. 

We started with an order of guacamole.  And they really did charge $11 for a small scoop of guacamole and  $7 for chips and salsa.  At that point I'm not sure I cared that they were good.  I ordered the squash quesadillas.  The veggies were crisp and it was tasty.  I enjoyed them.  But other folks didn't care for the mole, or the enchiladas.
