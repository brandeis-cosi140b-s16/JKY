Love the food! There is a guy bartender there who has been there for awhile & he is GREAT so don't hesitate to sit @ the bar to eat if you can't get a table.  
The only reason not 4-5 stars is we showed up one night for our 5 person reservation & our table wasn't ready even though I could see a couple empties..... so we told them we would sit @ the bar & wait where we proceeded to order drinks & apps, our reservation was for 8:30 & our group was getting a little hungry.  After about 45+ mins, our apps were completely devoured & we were getting ready to order another round... I, (the spokesman of our group) went to inquire about our table???  She said "oh?  you still want it? we thought you seemed fine at the bar"  Yeah, I am "fine" at the bar, I will make the most of any situation but I did reserve a table!!  WTH?  Well, of course they then seated our party but since when does waiting at the bar negate your request of a table?!  

Other than that the food is great & the service delightful, make sure the hostess understands whats going on, she seems a little slow.....
