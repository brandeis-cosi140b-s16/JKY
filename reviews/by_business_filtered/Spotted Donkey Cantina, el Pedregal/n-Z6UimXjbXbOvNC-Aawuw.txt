I had the Street Enchilladas and thought they were delicious and well prepared.  The food presentation was nice as well and lets you know someone cares about the food they are sending out of the kitchen.   Service was timely and our server was friendly.  Chips and salsa are normally included in most Mexican restaurants here in Phoenix, but we had to order them as a separate appitizer here.  That wasn't a huge surprise though considering the area of town.
