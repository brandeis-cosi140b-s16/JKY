I always leave Spotted Donkey satisfied...mostly because I always get the pork nachos to start off the meal! Every dish I have had has been great.  Favorites are the Carne Asada, Enchiladas, AZ Mac & Cheese. Service has always been good, not great...sometimes can be a little slow (table full of empty water glasses probably means you should bring a pitcher over once in a while...just sayin').  Margaritas are solid & beer is cold!
