This place has become our go to place to eat. Don't get me wrong it's not amazing - but it is tasty, consistent and convenient to us. We've eaten here 3x  - I had green chile chicken enchiladas each time and my husband had the chimichanga (2x) and a quesadilla. The green chile pretty much lacked any heat but the enchiladas had a good flavor. My husband enjoyed what he tried although he agreed the chile had no heat. The price is pretty comparable with other places in this area. Staff is always friendly and helpful (we typically do a to-go order so I can't speak to the dining in experience). This, perhaps, some of the better Mexican food in the area.
