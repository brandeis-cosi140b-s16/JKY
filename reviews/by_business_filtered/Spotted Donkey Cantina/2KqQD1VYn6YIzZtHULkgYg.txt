This place is pretty solid and I have no idea why it was so dead when I went.  I went with a party of 4 for happy hour ($2 off some drinks and food) on a Monday.  The place is spacious and very well decorated.  The place has a pretty cool upscale vibe to it.  We sat in the bar area and the service was very fast and friendly.  I tried 2 margaritas; the Skinny and the Silver Coin.  Both were excellent but the "skinny" one has nothing to do with the amount of calories rather that it is organic.  Go figure.  I still can't figure that one out.  The silver coin one was very good and was pretty strong.

The chips are awesome but the guac is just eh.  It seems to be fresh but is lacking any real flavor or kick.  The queso was excellent especially with the pita bread stuff (pita? really? very odd. but good).  The cheese had excellent flavor and a good amount of spice.  I would definitely get it again.

I will be back.
