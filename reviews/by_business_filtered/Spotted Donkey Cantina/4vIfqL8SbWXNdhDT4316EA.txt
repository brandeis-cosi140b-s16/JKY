I loved Spotted Donkey Cantina and absolutely hate to give it 3 stars. The recent change in Menu's and Chef, in my opinion, has not been a good change. I have a lot of respect for Robert McGrath, but I wish he had left the tried and true menu items alone, and brought with him some new dishes. 
While my favorite dish there, the Chile Relleno is still on the menu, they have changed the way it is prepared, presented and served and it was a major let down tonight. Also, many of the appetizers that we really liked are no longer available. Very disappointed. 
Take all of this and accompany it with higher prices than before, and the SDC has dropped from my most favorite restaurant that I have raved about to friends, to one I will go to 'some times. 
The restaurant is still a beautiful place to go and the staff is exceptional in service in every way, but I was very disappointed at the menu changes,
