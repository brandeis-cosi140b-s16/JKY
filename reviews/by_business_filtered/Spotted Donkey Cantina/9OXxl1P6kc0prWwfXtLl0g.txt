I can't believe I never wrote a review for this place! It's one of our 2 favorite places when we are staying in Scottsdale. If you get a chance to go there, you MUST have the Jalapeno Shooters! One of the 4 will blow your head off! The rest of the food is great too. Unfortunately the place has never been busy when we have been there, but we just love it.

BTW, the Happy Hour prices and choices are really good!
