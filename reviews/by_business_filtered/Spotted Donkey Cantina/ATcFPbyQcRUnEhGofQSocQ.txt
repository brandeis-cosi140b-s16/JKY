I am usually a person who sticks to Old Town or Arcadia/Biltmore when it comes to going out to eat due to where all my friends and I live.  I had to go north to run some errands, and a friend and I decided to check out the McCormick Ranch plaza.  I have to say it's changed a lot, since I've last been here.  There's Butters breakfast spot, busters, Zipps, and I think Jade Palace got replaced by TCBY.

My friend already ate at Busters, so we decided to go to Spotted Donkey.  I was amazed by the decor when I first stepped in.  It felt like the first time I walked into Modern Steak or J & G Steakhouse.  It was different, modern, yet had a nice casual vibe to it.  A modern latin decor with hints of burnt orange surrounded the area.  We decided to sit at the bar and was greeted by a pleasant bartender.

We had a couple of beers and tried out the ceviche which was fresh and vibrant.  We also split the nachos which was not the kind I was expecting.  The nachos had a lot of flavor on large tortilla chips.  I wish it had a more spicy kick to it, but I usually lean towards spicy than others.  The beers were around $6, but they were giant size.

We had a great time sitting around and catching up with some other friends who joined later.  I really like the service, scenery, and food.  I'll definitely do another followup review when I come back to try out the dinner entrees.
