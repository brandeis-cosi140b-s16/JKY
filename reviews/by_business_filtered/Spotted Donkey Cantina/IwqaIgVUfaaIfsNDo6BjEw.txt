This is not your Father's Mexican joint. The food is real good, but items that are normally sides included with dinner.....like beans, are extra. I had one of the house specialties...fish tostadas. The fish was perfectly fried and served on a small crispy corn tortilla, topped off with shredded cabbage and the tastiest sauce. We ordered chips and salsa, which comes with 3 salsas. The fire roasted salsa looked quite zesty, but tasted pretty bland. The mole inspired salsa was....I'm not a fan of mole. The green tomatillo salsa was pretty good and my fav. The chips were excellent!
