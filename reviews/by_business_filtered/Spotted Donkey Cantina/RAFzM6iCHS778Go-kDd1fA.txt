When a friend asked me to meet her at The Spotted Donkey, I had no idea what to expect.  It had just recently opened, and the name (although intriguing) didn't necessarily solicit mouthwatering images.  However, I was fantastically surprised to find that this place is one of the newer hidden gems in Scottsdale!  The ambiance and decor are fun and interesting, there's lots of seating, and their patio area is awesome!  Hidden in a shopping strip mall, you'd never guess from the outside that an oasis of fabulous food and drink awaited you right behind those dark paned doors.

I sampled several of their specialty margaritas and other concoctions, and all were delicious, but my all time favorite was the Blood Orange Margarita.  The food was also great (tried the calamari, guacamole, quesadilla, and queso dip), and the staff was friendly and helpful.

My favorite part about this place is their devotion to happy hour (almost as great as mine).  They offer hh every day of the week, and on the weekends, it is offered from opening (at 11am) until 6pm.  It's the perfect place to spend an afternoon!  I will definitely be going there again soon!
