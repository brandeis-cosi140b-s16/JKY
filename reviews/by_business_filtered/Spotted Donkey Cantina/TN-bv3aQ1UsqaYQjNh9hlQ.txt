While in Scottsdale with some family, we all decided that the trip would be for naught if we didn't try some local Mexican food. While I was thrilled at the prospect of some Mexican in a region known for it's amazing authentic options, I was a bit dissapointed with the Spotted Donkey Cantina.

First off, the Spotted Donkey Cantina is a nice place, with a calming atmosphere and servers that are both well-dressed and well-versed.  Additionally, the options are unique (although not what I would call "authentic") and I would be surprised if anyone found they were unable to find a dish they were excited to order.

However, when my food finally arrived (chili as an appetizer and enchiladas for the main course), I was a bit disappointed to find that my dishes were a bit underwhelming.  Both the pork chili and the enchiladas were almost entirely devoid of meat, instead containing mostly fillers like chopped tomatoes, cheese and beans.  As I'd paid nearly $20 in total for both, this was extremely disappointing.

Head over to the Spotted Donkey Cantina if you're looking for a good atmosphere for a business dinner or a date, but keep away if you're looking for either authentic Mexican cuisine or a bang for your buck.
