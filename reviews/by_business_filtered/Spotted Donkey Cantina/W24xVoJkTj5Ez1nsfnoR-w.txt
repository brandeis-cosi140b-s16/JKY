will go back on next trip to Scottsdale. Guacamole-great. jalapeno poppers served in shot glasses- amazing. tacos were served in hard shells that had been fried with meat in them which was a disappointment. we just asked for soft corn tortillas and created our own- problem solved! overall good experience.
