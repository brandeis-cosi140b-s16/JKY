This place was good. But not great, or even "really good". We stopped here for lunch on our way out of town. We ordered chips and salsa to start. If you have to pay $5 for chips and salsa, I expect some fantastic grub. They weren't. The chips were cold and stale, and the salsa was pretty bland and watered down. 

For our entree I ordered the Stuffed Pepper, and my girlfriend ordered two appetizers; the five cheese dip and the calamari. 

My pepper was OK, but nothing extraordinary. I've made much better at home on a Tuesday night. The cheese sauce, and the calamari were good, but lets be honest here, almost any similar deep fried or creamy fatty foods would be delicious. Those two appetizers do not require vast culinary depth. 

For the price I expected much more, and unless someone else was buying I wouldn't go back.
