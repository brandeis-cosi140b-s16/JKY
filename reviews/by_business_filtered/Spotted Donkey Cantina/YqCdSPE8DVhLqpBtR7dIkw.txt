The service at the bar is phenomenal! John gave me the menu and told me to make a few choices first, before offering his advice! He, then, made me this awesome margarita and suggested the machaca chicken taquitos after listening to my taste preference! It was a hit!  Make sure to sit at the bar and ask for John! Great bartender, great service and he has a cute butt! Cheers!
