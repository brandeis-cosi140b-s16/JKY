I love the space and the service is great!  The Decor is wonder and service attentive without being pussy suck-ups.  The food mostly has been better then average (Appetizers) to very good (breakfast).  I love there patios and the menu has a pretty reasonable variety of entrees.  This place is a bit over price but the location to my home makes up for it and well honestly everything is slightly overpriced in Scottsdale.  

Disclaimer: If you want authentic Mexican food you won't find it here or really anywhere in Scottsdale.  Take the drive to Mi Patio in Phoenix.
