Great atmosphere, delicious food, friendly service, and affordable pricing all contributed to my 5 star rating of Spotted Donkey Cantina. I have been here with friends multiple times for dinner and happy hour and we keep going back. 

To date, my favorite dish is the marinated chicken fajitas but I have yet to scratch the surface of this vastly creative menu. Modern adaptations of classic Mexican fare make this place stand out from other Mexican restaurants. Donkey Dusted Agave Chicken Wings served with Jalapeno Ranch dipping sauce, Dos Equis battered Fish Tostadas, and the Arizona Mac & Cheese made with rigatoni, fresh hatch green chiles, applewood bacon and Mexican cheeses are only a handful of the many eclectic menu choices at this casual-classy hot spot.
