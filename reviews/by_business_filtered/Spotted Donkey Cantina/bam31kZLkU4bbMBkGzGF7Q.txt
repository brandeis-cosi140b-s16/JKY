AMAZING! I just moved out of state, and I am really sad to be leaving this restaurant behind. 

First and foremost, the food: Perhaps it's not authentic Mexican (maybe I missed the part that the restaurant makes this promise), but whatever cuisine it is, it's delicious. The shrimp tacos are perfectly prepared and presented. I literally crave these, even the day after dining at the Cantina. The chimichanga and fajitas are also very good.  

The three salsa appetizer is yummy, but be aware: the pineapple salsa is just about the spiciest thing I've ever eaten.... Which brings me to the margaritas! Oh the margaritas! My husband usually hates margaritas, but he really enjoyed both the original lime and prickly pear margaritas. As for me, I love margaritas, and I found these to be exceptional. Yay for fresh ingredients!!! 

The restaurant itself: Every time I've been here the place has been decently busy. Not so busy that we have to wait for a table, but definietly not lacking in fellow diners. The decor is perfect: comfy chairs, opulent, but not stuffy or unwelcoming. The donkey theme sounds as if it could be tacky, but they pull it off with sophistication. Also, the last time we went they had an excellent all female mariachi band, which is up there with the best live entertainment I've had at a restaurant. No speakers or amps, just pure talent. 

It really doesn't get much better than this.
