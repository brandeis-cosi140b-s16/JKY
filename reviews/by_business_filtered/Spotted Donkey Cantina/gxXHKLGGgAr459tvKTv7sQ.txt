I like this place a lot! The food and the atmosphere are both really nice. 
Try the chimichanga, I really enjoyed it... Service is great also...
The only downsides (from my own experiences) is it seems relatively empty most of the time, and that it is a little on the pricey side... But they justify their prices with good food and REALLY good presentation of the food.
