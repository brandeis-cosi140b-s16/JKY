Food,service and atmosphere all very good.   Great addition to the area!!!
Staff friendly and helpful.   Patio would be good in nice weather---not too hot!   Very crowded first time we went but food fine.   Next time the place was quieter and we could appreciate the atmosphe and decor.   Lots of seating options!
