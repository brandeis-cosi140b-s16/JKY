Spotted Donkey....you have redeemed yourself in my mind.  After a very mediocre visit with poor service...I promised myself to return to give you a chance at redemption.
And you succeeded!   I ordered the queso,,,yummy,,,and the bread with it is delicious!   An a beef enchilada which was very substantial and so favorful!   Nice job!
