We kept driving by The Spotted Donkey and one Friday night we finally decided to stop by and see what it was about.

We sat on the patio, which was great. We were right by the fireplace, and it was romantic and intimate. We ordered chips and salsa as an app (they are not just given as you wait, like other Mexican restaurants.) The chips were delicious, and were served with three different salsas. They were DELICIOUS! One of them was a mango salsa, but man did it have KICK. Though I couldn't handle the heat, I kept going back for more because the flavor was incredible.

For dinner the hubs ordered the green chile mac n cheese, and I ordered the tacos - chicken & steak. All were incredible, and delicious. 

After dinner we decided to sit at the bar for a few more drinks, and we ordered their fried ice cream dessert. Yummm, it was a perfect way to end the meal. 

The staff was friendly, courteous and we loved the vibe of the place. We will definitely be back!
