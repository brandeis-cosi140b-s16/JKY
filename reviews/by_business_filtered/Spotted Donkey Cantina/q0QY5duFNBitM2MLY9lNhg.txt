LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this restaurant!!!
Where do I begin after dining in 3 times within a month??!! You want to know why I give this place 5 stars? O.K. here goes:
The restaurant itself is beautifully put together. 
Upon your grand entrance you're instantly greeted with a hello and taken to your table. 
Service is friendly and unobtrusive. You really feel taken care of!
The food is outstandingly delicious and addictive!  Enchiladas are YUMMY so is the Salmon tostada, and the cod baked in a banana leaf. The chimi is out of this world...just writing about it makes me hungry.
It is truly a one-of-a-kind Mexican restaurant with high quality ingredients, great service, and beautifully presented plates!! 

Now go check this place out and see what I'm raving about!!!
