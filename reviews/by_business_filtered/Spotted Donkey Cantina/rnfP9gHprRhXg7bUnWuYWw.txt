the boyfriend and i have patronized this place twice now and we enjoyed both visits though for different reasons - let me explain:

on both times we sat in the lounge area which has these incredibly comfortable chairs and we also visited on "school" nights so the restaurant wasn't very busy. the first time, our food was FANTASTIC but the waitress was often missing and our drinks ran low or totally ran out. 

the second time, the service was GREAT but though i'd ordered the same menu item as my first visit (chicken enchiladas) i was disappointed that it was dark meat (the first time it was all white meat chicken). hopefully, third time is a charm and they'll hit it out of the park on our next visit in both areas.

(the boyfriend was very pleased with his meals on both visits: Cornmeal Crusted Mahi-Mahi and Dos Equis Battered Fish Tostada.)

the margaritas are superb and they allow you to mix flavors - i recommend prickly pear and lime. i also suggest if you're going to get a margarita, order the first one listed on the menu (can't recall the name) since you get a little more margarita for the price.

one final whine: chips and salsa.  what kind of Mexican joint makes you pay for chips and salsa? i mean, the salsa is good and you get a few different types of salsa but c'mon! $6.00 for chips and salsa is kind of outrageous.
