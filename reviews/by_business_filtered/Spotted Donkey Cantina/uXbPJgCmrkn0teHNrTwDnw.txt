We went to the Hayden location. What a beautiful place! Filled with Ambiance. The colors and decor were just amazing. It seats over 375 people. Even if they were crowded I don't imagine it being a long wait to get seated.  It had a decent selection of beers, not too many craft beers which is mostly what I drink, but it did have a Negro Modelo Dark and a Great White Hefeweizen, which is more than many Mexican/Spanish style cuisines, so that is more then enough for me. They also had many mixed drinks and Margaritas. The food was great and the service was very good as well. I ordered"*Cascabel-Chile Marinated Carne Asada ( medium rare) poblano chile escabeche, avocado-tomatillo sauce, black beans, spanish rice and flour tortillas $17.50"and my boyfriend ordered, "Enchiladas with mexican beer braised beef, cheddar and new mexican hatch green chile, with chimayo red and green chile sauces, Spanish rice, guacamole and sour cream $14.00" ,which were both very good. It makes for a nice date night. We will definitely be back.
