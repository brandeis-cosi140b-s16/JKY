This place was pretty good.  

It was a weekday so the place was pretty dead.  Our server was pretty attentive and extremely knowledgeable of the menu.  He recommended stuff to us that ended up ordering and were happy with.

We ordered the Six Shooters (tortilla crusted hand stuffed cheddar, bacon filled jalapeno shots with a cilantro buttermilk sauce) - it was too spicy for me, but the other 3 enjoyed them.

We also ordered the Nachos (Large corn tortilla rounds with drunken black beans, pulled pork, serrano chile, fire roasted tomato and tomatillo salsa, and a blend of cheddar, manchego, monterrey jack cheese and mexican crema cheeses.)  Pretty darn amazing.  

The hubs ordered the fish tacos which were pretty tasty and filled him up.

I ordered the fajitas, which was nothing special and could be eaten at any other restaurant that served fajitas.

My brother ordered the pan roasted pork tenderloins which were cooked perfectly medium-rare and was probably the best dish out of all of ours.

My SIL ordered the enchilada - and quite honestly, I don't remember if she liked it or not.

In the end, we decided to try to cuban corn - which was by far, the best!  I could have eaten more if there was any left.  

For the 4 of us, it was almost $180 (including tip).  A bit pricey, but I would go back - even if it was just for the corn on the cob...and the great service.
