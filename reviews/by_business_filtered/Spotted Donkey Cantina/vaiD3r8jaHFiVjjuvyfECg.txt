High class Mexican food.  Chips and salsa are not on the house but the appetizers featuring the salsa trio is well worth the price.  Warning the pineapple habenero salsa is quite hot.  A pitcher of Margaritas is very small for the cost of $30 but again, the best Margaritas ive ever had.  Entrees were very reasonably priced around $14.  The enchiladas were stamdard but good, signature tacos were light, fresh and flavorful.  Contemporary presentation.  Very satisfied and would return if I wasn't on vacation!  Trendy decor, not too loud, expect to circle for parking.
