Love the decor - they've done a great job ... too bad the food does not have equal appeal.  

Tried a number of appetizers and there was not a single one that stood out!  Very large bar - personal bartenders, but if they get busy, not sure they will be prepared.  Also runners who bring the food out to the bar, never know where they are going with it.  Need to work on a better system.
