The Potted Donkey sets itself apart by offering more than the standard Sonoran food.  You might like the grilled salmon tostada or the cornmeal crusted mahi-mahi.  My favorite is the Pork Antojito.  The sangria is excellent, and the fried icecream is unique.  Atmosphere and service are great.  Unfortunately they won't get five stars as long as they make you pay for the chips and salsa.
