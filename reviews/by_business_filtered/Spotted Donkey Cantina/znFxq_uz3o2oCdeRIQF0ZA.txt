Spotted Donkey Cantina, or SDC, is a interesting mix of Mexican, Spanish, and maybe even Indian food. Being from Texas I am used to traditional Tex Mex when I have Mexican food, and SDC's dishes could not be farther from that. That is not to say that I didn't enjoy it though. 

We made reservations on Open Table straight through the Spotted Donkey Cantina's Yelp page, which was really convenient - especially since we had a big family group of 11 and decided to find a dinner spot around 6:30pm. We got a reservation for 8 and they seated us at a nice big table off by ourselves.

The decor of the restaurant is a cool combo of rustic and modern, with couches and cool art and a ton of seating.

I ordered the prickly pear frozen margarita first, but it was reeaaally sweet so I ordered a skinny marg next and it was awesome.

My only real complaint is that they charged for chips and salsa, which is something I am definitely not used to in Texas. However, the chips came with three different homemade salsas (red, green, and an amazing and SPICY pineapple habanero salsa) and they kept bringing out more when we ran out, so that was nice.

I had the BYO (build your own) short rib tacos. The meat was AWESOME, but the tortillas were really tiny and there weren't a lot of "fixins" to put in the tacos. Overall, good order though. My grandfather got the chopped salad, but I think he got a bit sick from it... could have been something else though, who knows!

This restaurant is very expensive for what you are getting. They should lower their prices and people would order more. I wanted to try a bunch of appetizers and stuff on the menu, but my tacos were like 19 bucks, so I figured it would be a ton of food, so I just ordered the entree.

This restaurant is fine, and I might go back for a skinny margarita and appetizers if I'm back in the Scottsdale area.
