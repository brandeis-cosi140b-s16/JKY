Club Cactus orrrrr nah? This place is, overall, a hot mess. I've been there twice now and it was just  ... meh. The decor is pretty neat, but it's loud. Between the music being too loud and all basic girls drunk on IC Light in their slushies screaming...I mean ... talking, this place either needs some sound panels or to just give up and put a dance floor in. I'm all for a fun, exciting environment, but this just doesn't work for a restaurant. 

I haven't tried the Yinzerita everyone goes cray cray for, but the other drinks were unimpressive (mojito was too sweet,  moscow mule tasted like fake lime juice and bad ginger beer, apple-pear martini was basically an Apple Pucker-tini, etc). I will say, the blood orange margarita was okay, but we spent way too much money on garbage drinks to get to that point - maybe I was just too drunk to tell. 

The food? Well, the guac was good, even though we pulled a piece of plastic out of our chips (it looked like the tip from a tube of caulking). Everything, overall,  was below average at best. Dear Steel Cactus, quit trying with tofu. The fajitas and tacos were both a disaster. Giant chunks of deep fried tofu that were soaking wet on the inside. 

Our waitress was sweet, but overall the staff was like a group of college kids who had no supervision. We spotted the manager sitting in the office playing on the computer just chomping away on some food. He didn't notice that the bar was taking 35 min to get tables their drinks and that no one had tended to the  restroom in who knows how long.  It's cool,  no one needs toilet paper and the clogged toilet was an added bonus. A quick peek in the kitchen showed half the staff goofing off or just playing on their phones. 

They deserved a second chance, but I won't be in a hurry to try for a third.
