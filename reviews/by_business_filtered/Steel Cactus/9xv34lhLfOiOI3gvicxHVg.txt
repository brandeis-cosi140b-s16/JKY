Multiple take out orders, never right. Last time (6 weeks ago) I picked up on my way to work around 9p and it wasn't even close to right but I was already gone by the time I looked in the bag. Called back and they told me I had "a week" to go back to claim a new meal. Not likely to happen, sorry; especially only within A WEEK!!! I also recently went for drinks on the top deck and waited well over 20 mins despite there being only maybe 20-30 people up there and 3 people behind the bar, 2 of whom were just washing glasses. They really, really need a manager. As someone who has worked in the restaurant industry before, there just is no supervision and it seems this is another top-down disaster in Shadyside. Great concept, poor execution
