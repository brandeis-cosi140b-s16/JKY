Steel Cactus was a really fun place when I went months ago! It was very crowded probably due to it being a Saturday night, but my group and I were able to find a corner to have all to ourselves and had a blast! I ordered some different fun and fruity drinks and they were good and priced low-moderate. The first floor is really dark and flooded with people at the bar and eating. The second floor has some tables, some booths on the side and standing room by the bar and at the corners of the building. I would definitely come back here on a drinking night, or even to try their food in the afternoon some time! Definitely check this place out for the atmosphere, drinks and location!
