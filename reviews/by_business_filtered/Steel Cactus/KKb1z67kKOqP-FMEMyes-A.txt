I've been to Steel Cactus several times since the fall. Host/hostess not friendly or helpful any time. Customers should be "greeted" by friendly staff or first impression is lost. Last Saturday we are at the bar. Bar staff didn't smile. Served meals then disappeared! Guacamole was tasteless. Really? In a Mexican restaurant. Cool looking place though.
