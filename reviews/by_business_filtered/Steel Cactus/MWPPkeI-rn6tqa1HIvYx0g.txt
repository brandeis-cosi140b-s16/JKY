Great addition to Walnut Street.  I highly recommend attending for happy hour as I think they have one of the best happy hour deals in Pittsburgh.  From 5-7 it is half off all appetizers which includes guacamole, chips/salsa and quesadillas.  The specialty drinks at $5 and they usually have $2.50 beer specials and $3 wine specials.  This past visit I went with the specialty margarita (also the Yinzerita is only $7 at happy hour) and my date choose the Moscow Mule.  We ordered chips and guacamole (the guacamole is delicious!) and I got a beef taco and he ordered the pork quesadilla. All super delicious and it only came to $21!  On Tuesdays it is Taco Tuesdays so you could order as many $2.50 tacos as you would like and can pick from flour or corn soft shells (they do not have hard shells) and pick your meat as well as the toppings.  Great place in the summer with the rooftop bar! When it is busy sometimes the service is not that great but I can live with that. Also recommend trying a pitcher of margaritas (great deal).
