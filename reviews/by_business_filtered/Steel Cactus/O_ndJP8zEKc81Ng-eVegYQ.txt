A group of us went to the Steel Cactus last Saturday for an early dinner.  While a few friends had already been to the restaurant, I was a newbie and was pleasantly surprised by the decor and atmosphere.  The restaurant patronage was somewhat sparse and they seemed really, really overstaffed (three hostesses??), but I suppose they were anticipating a later dinner rush.

When we arrived, we asked for a table for five people and I'm not sure if the hostess has issues with judging sizes or what, but she put us in a booth that was clearly made for four people.  It was a little disappointing to look at the big, empty booth right next to us for our entire meal whilst one of our party was forced to sit in a chair on the end of a rounded table...

Anyway, the waitress was nice and we placed orders for our food.  I personally was not disappointed in the nachos I orded (HUGE!), but some of us whom ordered meals were a bit disappointed by their portions.  I tasted everybody's food and while it was good, I can't say that there was anything spectacular about any of the food.  The fish tacos were extremely bland.

Of course, I would go back to the Steel Cactus and try some of their other options, but overall for their pricing and what I've already tried, I can't say I'm going to go into with the highest of expectations.
