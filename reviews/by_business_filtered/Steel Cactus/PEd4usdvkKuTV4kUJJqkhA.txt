To me, Steel Cactus is about a fun place to meet up with friends!  There's plenty of seating and a large deck, so it's perfect for sitting around and chatting over drinks.

Catch their happy hour, which doesn't end till 7pm.  Nibble on whatever their daily special is.  Enjoy the lively atmosphere, and possibly use their photobooth, tucked away by the bathrooms.  

The food was just ok and the margarita very "from-a-mix" tasting, which is the main reason I'm giving 3 stars.  Generic mexican food, nothing special.  (I'm pretty biased and picky about mexican food.  Usually, I'll reserve mexican food for trips back to Texas or California.).  But again, I stress that this would probably only be a place I go for casual meet ups over drinks.  Don't be expecting the most authentic best tasting mexican fare.

Service is pretty good, considering the high pace/bar atmosphere.  The bartenders are always hustling around during happy hour, so they're very quick and no-nonsense.  But definitely not rude.  The last time I was in, there were a few credit card technical difficulties and also some order mixups, but they were handled very quickly and the bartender was very apologetic.
