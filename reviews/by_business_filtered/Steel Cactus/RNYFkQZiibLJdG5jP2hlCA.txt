I graduated from Pitt a few years ago and came back to my old stumping grounds in Shadyside. Anyway, this place was new so I figure I would give it a try.

First, the drinks barely have any alcohol. My mango margarita tasted like juice, with a little drop of tequila. Second, the food isn't that good. Ordered a chicken quesadilla that had to be sent back because the chicken was undercooked.

Service is good though. 

This place would be cool in the sumer.
