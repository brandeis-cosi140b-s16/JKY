I guess I can't really be surprised that a restaurant like this butchered Mexican food.  After all, it is more Americanized Mexican food than anything.  If you like Qdoba or Chipotle, then you'll be fine here.  Otherwise, you'll be pretty disappointed.

I ordered the Carne Asada Burrito.  It had obvious fillers like black beans and rice but I wanted to give it a shot.  The meat tasted pretty good.  But it was overpowered by black beans and rice.

We also ordered a Chicken Quesadilla.  It didn't differ from my burrito all too much because all I tasted was black beans.

Worst part about this place are the tables.  The tables have holes all over them to mimic holes in wood.  Looks great except we find bits of old and new food in all the holes.  How disgusting is that?

My friends said the drinks were good but how bad can any place mess that up?  Overall, it's an ok spot to hang out and talk.  The hostess was nice and the waitress was good.  I had no problems with service.  If you like the Qdoba and Chipotle type Mexican food then you're fine here.  I don't really feel compelled to come back or give it another try.
