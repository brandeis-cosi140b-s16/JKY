Due to accessibility I've been back twice to Steel Cactus and my consensus is just meh for meals but great for drinks and chips. The first time we sat at the bar. Ordered chips and queso and a beer, which was thumbs up. I like how their chips are seasoned. I ordered the chicken tacos but the food lacked flavor. The chimichanga dessert though was the bomb! The second time we ordered chips and guacamole traditional, which was (standard) delicious. I wasn't that hungry so I ordered the salmon and pineapple ceviche and I was not a fan at all. The ceviche was a big bowl of mush by the time I received and the flavors did not meld well together. Also we tried to order Dos Equis on draft but there was something wrong with the tap that made it taste like a completely different beer. And while the waitress didn't charge us for that draft beer she handed us a bottle of Dos Equis and charged us for that, as oppose to asking if we wanted another type of beer. What a bummer as had high hopes for Steel Cactus.
