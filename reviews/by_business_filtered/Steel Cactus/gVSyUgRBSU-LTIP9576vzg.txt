Yikes, this place should have a sign that says '30somethings stay out.' 

If I go to a place that calls itself a 'Mexican cantina,' I expect to not get a blank stare from waitstaff when I ask to see a tequila list. (To be fair, once they located said list, I was pleased to see that there were a couple of decent tequilas on the list. They were mostly spelled wrong, but they were on there!)

I guess I just can't understand the circumstances in which you would say, 'Hey! Let's go to Steel Cactus!' after the first time you accidentally show up there. It was crowded and hot and disorganized. We'd hoped to order food, but couldn't find a server anywhere in sight. Most people were drinking what appeared to be a huge frozen margarita with a beer bottle in it. If that's your thing, go on with it, but it kiiiiiind of grosses me out.

If I want a huge margarita, I'll go to Mad Mex. If I want authentic Mexican food, I'll go to Cuzamil. If I want good tequila, I'll go to Verde. If I want to feel old, have to pass by half a dozen bouncers to get anywhere, and watch millennials try to pick each other up, I'll go back to Steel Cactus.
