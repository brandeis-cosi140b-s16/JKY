The place is a decent spot for a quick drink in the neighborhood mainly especially during the summer time.  The rooftop patio is very nice and makes a nice little bar.  Bar-tending service could be better though.

Food wise is nothing extraordinary.  It is a decent place to eat; nothing authentic of course - more like Mad Mex type of food.  I would not recommend it for taking there someone to impress but it is definitely a nice hang-out place.
