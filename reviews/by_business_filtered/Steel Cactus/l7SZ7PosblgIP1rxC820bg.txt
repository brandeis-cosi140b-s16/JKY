I used to rave about this place for their happy hour. I think they've limited their happy hour menu now, but regardless, one thing must be said: their water is horrendous. Every place in Pittsburgh has very normal tasting water (as in, it doesn't taste like anything). For some reason, every time I have been here, the water is undrinkable. So it must be said that every piece of ice that goes into your margarita is coming from the same place. For that reason alone, AVOID.
