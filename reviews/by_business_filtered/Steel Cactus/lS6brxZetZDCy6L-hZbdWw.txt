Hipper than Chipotle, but more of a straight shooter than Mad Mex.  Cool tin ceilings, massive tables with inlaid steel cactii and simple but well prepared tex mex make this a worthy alternative to other Shadyside Mexican options.  My only complaint is, the food can take a while to be prepared, but it's a price I'm happy to pay to get everything made fresh and hot.  Steel Cactus is particularly good during early and late night happy hours where you can get great drink specials, $2 tacos and $5 for GINORMOUS juicy burritos.  Steel Cactus, welcome to the neighborhood, we're glad to have you!
