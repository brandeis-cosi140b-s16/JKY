As a bar, I think this place is great. Never too crazy and the deck upstairs is fantastic when the weather is nice. I recently went for brunch and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. They have $2 mimosas and a Bloody Mary bar. The food was excellent as well. And the best part was it wasn't crowded at all! Definitely beats waiting in line at Pamela's or Cafe Moulin.
