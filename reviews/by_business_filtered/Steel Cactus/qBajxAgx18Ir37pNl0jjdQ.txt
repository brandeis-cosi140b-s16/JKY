I've been here a few times now for the late-night scene, but had held off on coming in for the food because I had heard it wasn't that great and I wanted to give them a chance to work out their kinks. I came in for lunch this past Friday, and had the same sentiment as the people I had talked to. I feel like my experience at most Mexican restaurants can be predicted by my experience with the guacamole, and this held true at Steel Cactus. The gauc was neither good nor bad - while the avocado seemed fresh, the flavor wasn't great, and the guac itself was pretty bland. I had the soup of the day - Lobster Bisque - as that is one of my favorite soups. There was quite a bit of lobster in it, but the flavor was lacking. I also had the chance to try the Chicken Soup, which had a bit of a kick, but I still wasn't particularly impressed. The Veggie Burrito was decent, although again, nothing that left me wanting me. 

All of that being said, I would still come back because the venue is so incredible. They have done a great job renovating the place. The rooftop is amazing and they have now winter-proofed it to a degree so they can keep it open as the weather changes. The bar is also very unique and decorated nicely. Although I was a bit disappointed in the beer selection, they have a full bar.
