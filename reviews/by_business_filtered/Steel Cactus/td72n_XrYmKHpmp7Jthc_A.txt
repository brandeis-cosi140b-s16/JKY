I've been back quite a few times for happy hour and I do have to say that I am liking Steel Cactus more and more for that.  I did order soup yesterday and it took almost 5 minutes to get a spoon for it because apparently the waiter didn't actually have access to the soup spoons and had to get one from the kitchen.  It's ok though because it wasn't particularly good (cold or warm) anyway.  Another thing I would like to see is some consistency.  The PIC and I order pretty much the same things when we go there, but each time the dishes are different.  Do the nachos come with black beans or was that a mistake this time?  How do I get a little cup of chopped up jalepenos once and the next time I get whole ones?  Why do I get a different salsa each time?  It's all very confusing.

There is one thing that will make me give this place an extra star - get some darned refried beans on that menu!
