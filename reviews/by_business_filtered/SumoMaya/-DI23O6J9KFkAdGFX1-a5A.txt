Went there a couple of weeks ago with my good friend who has finally decided to give sushi a try. I did have a couple of rolls, but my favorite was the Rollo Chingon; Spanish for Badass Roll.  You have to try the Guacamole, I forgot if they put crab or oysters on it, but worth the shot. But, wasn't too thrilled with the noodles we ordered. Nonetheless, a great scene and the staff was very friendly. Will return for sure.
