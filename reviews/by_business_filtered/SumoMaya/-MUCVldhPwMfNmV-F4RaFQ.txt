I came here for the sushi with my co-worker and had a decent experience.  We sat down at the sushi bar and like the friendliness of the sushi makers and the general atmosphere.  They play cool background music and the place is nicely decorated with a modern feel.

We started off with some standard rolls which were good.  The salmon avocado roll was the best of the four that we ordered.  The texture was nice with the smoothness of the avocado and the salmon went down smoothly as well.  The spicy tuna yellowtail was not as good, but was a little more one-note with a little too much heat that overwhelmed the roll.  The speciaty sumo were not nearly as good, being a little flat.  The shishito roll looked really elegant with the salmon topped with slices of kiwi, but it ended up being rather flat.  I couldn't taste the kiwi at all and the peppers kind of overwhelmed the roll.  The hemachi roll was one-note as well.  There was just too much acidity.

The price was reasonable at ~ $60 for two people after tip and we both were full.
