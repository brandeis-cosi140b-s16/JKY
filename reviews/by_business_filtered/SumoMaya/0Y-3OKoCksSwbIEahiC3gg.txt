I really love the design and decor of this new restaurant.  Very open feeling and ultra hip place to eat, drink and have fun.

I've had several of the small plates and really like their beer and wine selections.  Their cocktails are also very original and tasty.

My favorite dishes are the shaking beef and the salmon and avocado roll.  The guacamole is great but the chips it comes with can be overly greasy at times.

Parking can be a challenge so go with the free valet if you can't find a parking spot on your own.
