Love the vibe of the restaurant. Came in with my mother, father, and baby sister. They were able to tweak a dish for the baby to make sure she could eat with the rest of us. I had the rock shrimp(must have) and the tuna tacos. All the portions are small but delicious. If you are looking to fill up without spending very much this is not the place for you. I enjoyed the food as did the rest of the family. The downfall is the server was barely there. I don't like my meals rushed but it was to the point I didn't get to order a drink until 20 minutes in. Despite that I will definitely be back. Probably without the baby this time! Overall good time.
