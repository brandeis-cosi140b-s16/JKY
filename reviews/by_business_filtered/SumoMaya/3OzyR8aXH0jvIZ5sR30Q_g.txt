Interesting concept with some hits and misses. Maybe I'm getting old, but I don't understand how loud dance-beat music compliments any dining experience. Does anybody play music at home that is so loud they can hardly talk during dinner? Our waitstaff was friendly and efficient but her high-octane "valley girl on steroids" delivery may force me to punch the next person who says "absolutely!!" or "definitely!!!" 
The guac with pomegranate was quite good as was the salmon ceviche, although it was really more like sashimi in sauce. The chopped salad had interesting ingredients and was pretty good but a bit bland. The pad thai had great flavors but suffered from way too much sauce. We had toffee cake dessert that was exceptional. 
Overall it was interesting and I might try it again.
