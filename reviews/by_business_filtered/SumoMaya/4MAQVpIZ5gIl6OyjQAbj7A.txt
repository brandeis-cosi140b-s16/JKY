My husband and I had a great experience here. This is a big, open, loud place with a feeling of a lot of activity. There is a large bar in the center with projector televisions, and even the inside area has an outdoors feel. Not the place to go for a quiet, intimate dinner. The waitress told us there were four kitchens, so everything you order comes out at different times. We had a great server who seemed to have absolute perfect timing - was always there when we wanted something without being overbearing. The food is served tapas style, but the portions of most of what we ordered were actually pretty large and we ended up ordering more food than we needed. We got the edamame, the pomegranite guac, pork pad thai, and korean beef tacos. Everything was amazing. The drinks were also fantastic. I expected to like the place based on what I had heard, but it exceeded my expectations.
