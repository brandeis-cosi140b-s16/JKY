If a Hostess tells you all tables were reserved and absolutely no tables left, this place must be beyond amazing, right? 

We dined during the Friday happy hour mad rush between 5-6PM. They did find a table for us.  However, we just needed to be out by 7PM for the next reserved party.  We ended sitting in the back patio area. It was HOT HOT, and not just for the beautiful interior design. The shade and water mist didn't help much with the high humidity that day. Our Waitress was superb! She quickly ordered and got our food. 

We ordered a few items off their social hour menu and dinner menu.  I guess the Asian side in me that I'm always skeptical when it comes to Asian Fusion. I was sold and impressed on the quality of their dishes. We tried a few of the street tacos - Wild Mushroom, Korean beef and Pork "Al Pastor". They were grilled, so juicy, and incredibly flavorful. The traditional guac was just ok for me.  I do like the tortilla chips that came with it. It didn't taste like the typical restaurant chips. It tasted homemade sea salt tortilla chips. 

Another dish I highly recommend off of the dinner menu is the Chinese Style Chile-Crab Garlic Noodles. It's not Crustacean Garlic Noodles, but will still satisfy your garlic noodles craving with just little spicy kick in it.  I will have to return and try it with their many cocktails too. 

It's a trendy and loud place. A great place for girls night out, date night, or bring out of town guest. It is complimentary parking valet. You might be able find an available parking space by the bank if you dine after 5PM. Parking spaces are limited. The parking lot is shared with other businesses in the same area. Park at your own risk!
