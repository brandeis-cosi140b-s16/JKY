I love the fusion of Mexican/Asian food in this place - like getting a little bit of this and a little bit of that, most interesting. I definitely would return to try more dishes. The calamari was amazing, nothing like I've ever had before, sweet and sour and tasty and the presentation was delectable. Everyone loved their food and was happy with what they ordered.  Service was timely, the server was friendly, imported wines were affordable.  Only negative was the music, a bit too loud and people were talking above it...
