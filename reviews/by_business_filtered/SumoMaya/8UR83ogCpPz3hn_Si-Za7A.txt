Just got back from an early Friday night drinks and dinner at SumoMaya.  Arrived at 7ish and left at 9:30.  There were four of us.  

The good:  The food was great!  Drinks were creative and tasty.  Korean tacos amazing and sushi rolls fabulous.   Service was outstanding.  Decor was cool.  Tree in the middle of the restaurant was inventive and fun!  Had a reservation so no waiting.  Music was hip and loud and made for a dynamic atmosphere.  

The bad:  It is a Scottsdale cliche with a high "ick" factor.  Husband saw a steroid dude and duck lipped woman leave the men's bathroom stall together at 8:15pm, we had wine spilled on us while we were seated at our table because of an almost bar fight between drunk 50 year olds, and had a front row seat for what looked like a dating scene nightmare.  Kid you not, Godzilla was playing on the big screen over the bar as if to drive home the point.  Felt like I was in a cartoon version of Jersey Shore meets Real Housewives of OC.   If this sounds like your thing, this is your place!
