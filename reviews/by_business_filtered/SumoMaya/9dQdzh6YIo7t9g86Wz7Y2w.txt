So the first time we tried out SumoMayo was opening weekend. Wasn't at all impressed. But went again last night for a friends birthday and wow, they've come a long way! The chips and pomegranate guac were awesome.  For dinner, I ordered the chopped salad and it was much larger than I expected with tons of veggies and super flavorful. I asked the waiter if they had another dressing option, like balsamic vinegar or anything else and he said no, which was surprising since their other salads had different dressing options? So instead I used some the soy sauce on the table and it was a-ok. My husband got the ceasar salad, which was also generously sized and very tasty.  Everyone in our party was happy with their meals and and then the desserts...wow, everything was so yum! Glad we had the opportunity to give it another try and will certainly be back.
