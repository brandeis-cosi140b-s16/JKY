Great service! My first time here as a new person to AZ.i sat at the bar and Matt was amazing! Very engaging and his recommendations were spot on! Had the Korean beef tacos and pork al pastor tacos and would get them again along with the Calamari and edamame....and his old fashion was on target! This will be a regular on my list of AZ faves :-)
