Don't believe the hype.  Fad food. 

Service is abysmal. Club kids comparing notes about the prior night on the town and a sushi chef comparing different rolls to the size of his, and his coworkers penis. His co worker is the shorter but fatter roll in case you were interested.  I'd rather just have a server that pays attention.  

Food is a cool idea of fusing Mexican and Asian but the execution falls way short and diminishes the concept. Why put two great things together if they outcome is going to be sub-par?  Kind of what like Martin Sheen would say.   

Had a bagel with lox fusion concept that was just a straight up mess on the plate. Somehow it remained boring even though It was complicated and overdone.

In the end it's a gimmick and doesn't have legs. Scottsdale people will think it's awesome for about another year and they'll come up with a new fad for you. 

I say go somewhere else.
