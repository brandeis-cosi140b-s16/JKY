First off, I don't really understand this concept. I have dined here three separate times and had three very separate experiences

the first time we dined there was in the evening on a Wednesday night, there were two of us. We were seated immediately, had the greatest most bubbly server who took great care of us. We also both have food allergies, so she was excellent with that.

The last time I dined here, and was excited to take my friends before a alumnae meeting. There were planned to be 6 of us. When I walked in, a friend was already waiting so I went up and said "We have a party of six." the hostess just stared at me blankly and then said "well do you have a reservation?" mind you, this was at 4:30 in the afternoon and the restaurant was DEAD, completely empty. I said no, and she proceeded to address the business men next to us, who had a reservation and got them seated. 

Maybe ten minutes later she still had not said anything to us, and finally she came over and asked if we could sit in the corner booth, which was fine. 

The next  crappy part was our service. We had a taller dark haired woman as our server who was simply annoyed we were sitting there. I tried to crack a joke and she just looked at me. We had arrived first so we ordered wine and some guacamole. Our other friends got lost so they ended up showing up 20 minutes later and the waitress had the same crappy attitude towards them. We also asked for advice on which Pinot Noir and which Malbec to drink and she rolled her eyes at us. It was a very bad experience compared to the first one.

Overall, I don't think I will be going back there, mostly because I'm not quite sure why you have to have a reservation at 4pm, why the hostesses are very snotty, and why the service is so inconsistent.
