Love this restaurant for dinner and have had great service the times I've been here.....but i think I'll pass on their brunch from now on. At least until they get their service faster, since their brunch is still newer. Our server Jorge is incredibly slow. We order drinks, ask for water, or really anything....and it takes much longer than it should.....especially since we're the only ones dining here now. The bartender was slow too....i watched her through the mirror by our table take her time in making our drinks. I'll stick to coming here for dinner when their service is much more on key :)
