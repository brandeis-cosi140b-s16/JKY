We frequently drive by this new trendy restaurant on Scottsdale Rd. We decided to give it a try at lunch. The food was delicious and I would highly recommend the shrimp avocado salad. The ambiance and decor is similar to other restaurants you'll find in Scottsdale. The only reason they don't get 6 stars is due to the service... Our waitress was great, just the time it takes to get your food is longer than you'd like for lunch. We'll definitely be back!
