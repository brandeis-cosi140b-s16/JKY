The hamachi roll was good but the tacos were small for $7. They should have been a tiny appetizer. Wait staff were ok but they were busy and said there was an hour to two hour wait. We waited 45 min. Would have had a seat at the bar because this nice guy moved over for us but then post menopause lady and her eager friend took our spots. All of paradise valley was here though so if you wanna be out, good place with a good vibe.
