We've been here several times and had good experiences but this time the service at the bar was a little slow,  although very  pleasant bartenters.
When we used a localdines coupon the  manager gave us a hard time with even though we were using it within the guidelines . He was not putting the customer first at all. Can't say we'll go back based on this experience considering all of the other great places in Scottsdale.
