Nice Gimmick, but really over complicating food, mixing too many different styles....small servings, more like tapas style.  You are better off going to the best Mexican restaurant in town or the best sushi bar in town and forget trying to combine and blend the two!  Trendy, maybe too trendy for this area....  I wonder if this place will be open in a year or two?
