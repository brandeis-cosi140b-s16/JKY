Good drinks, awesome sushi, good guacamole.  Their brunch is so interesting, and I can't say enough about the mushroom omelette.  It's fantastic.  Their guacamole are all good, especially the bacon guac.  Their sushi is so unusual,  and I'm always pleased with what we order.  They also have great drinks and bartenders.  They had a dj the last evening we were there, which was very cool.  Great spot for groups or date night!
