This was my second time here, food and experience was great the first time but this time, not so much.  To start they use to carry Azule Ultra, no one else carried it and that was the entire reason we went there.  They no longer carry it but that's not a huge deal because last time the food and great service made up for it.  This time the food was ok and the server was a goof but did a good job.  Later that night three of the 6 people that ate there got very sick.  I can't be sure but I think it was the food at this location.
