We heard a lot of times from friends and family here. I really wasn't sure what should I expect to this restaurant. One day I was pretty curious about here for cocktails. We had 3 different margaritas and other cocktails and sushi rolls. Everything was a bit different style than what I usually get to other places but all of them was so great! This is good place to drink and chat.
