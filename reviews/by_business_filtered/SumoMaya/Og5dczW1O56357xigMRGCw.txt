We had dinner on Friday night and were promptly greeted by the upbeat smiling host staff. Brittany sat us right away and was very professional and friendly. I don't remember our servers name but she was very attentive and knew the menu well and was also very nice. We ordered drinks that were amazing. I highly recommend trying the Magic Mojito. So yummy and try it even if you don't typically like mojitos.
Our food was also outstanding. We had a sushi roll a shrimp appetizer and the carne asada tacos. Carne had a bit too much of the grill char taste for me but was still really good and a cool presentation. The manager Jason stopped by to check on us and I always appreciate that.
This was our second visit to Sumomaya and certainly won't be our last.
