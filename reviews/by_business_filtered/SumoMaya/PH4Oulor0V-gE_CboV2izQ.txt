The food is very good, portions are a bit small. We liked everything we ordered. Specially the Shaking Beef is a must try, the beef tacos were great, also the rock shrimp tempura. 
The atmosphere is great, good mixture of the Sumo and the Maya. Music was not too loud, which was great. Over all great experience and definitely going back to try more.
