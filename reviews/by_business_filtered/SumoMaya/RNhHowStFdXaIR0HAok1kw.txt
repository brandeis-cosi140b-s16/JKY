My girlfriend and I went here one night both fell in love! First of all there is a tree in the middle of the restaurant and they were playing the original godzilla- who wouldn't love that?! The food is served family style and meant for sharing and our server did an amazing job of explaining everything and his recommendations were spot on. We had 5 dishes - The Crab Guacamole, Calamari, Korean Beef Tacos, Shaking Beef, and Kimchi Fried rice with shrimp. All of it was great! If we went back we would probably leave out the Crab Guacamole, not because it wasn't good, just that everything else was amazing and we were stuffed! The Korean beef tacos were out of this world! It had the most amazing flavor and the crispy pickled veggies on top of the beef was the perfect flavor addition! We could have these everyday! We will definitely be back and can't wait to try more
