Just went here for my birthday and it was awesome.  Great drinks, great service, great food, great atmosphere.  We tried several menu items...
Highly recommend the pomegranate Guacamole, the california roll with real blue crab, the pork belly entree, sea bass, and ahi tuna tartar dish.  All were to die for.  We'll be back this weekend!
