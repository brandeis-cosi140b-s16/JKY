I travel 40 plus weeks a year and in doing so enjoy seeking out restaurants for their food and atmosphere. With the in mind, Sumo-Maya is truly a standout.  From decor, to service to food... outstanding is the only word I can describe it.  

I've been back multiple times and tried several dishes and never have I had anything to say other than wow!  And if there is a culinary god - on day 1 he/she created the Eggs Benedict with Short Rips. Life changing.  

My compliments to Chef Matt and team.  Bravo!
