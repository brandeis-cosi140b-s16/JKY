This was my first time visiting Sumo-Maya.  My wife and I wanted to try it our as we were nearby for a movie.  

First let me begin by acknowledging our awesome, helpful and humble server (Anna).  She was great and super funny with the banter. 

Food was tasty and very unique. The atmosphere was hip with great music playing. 

Food/Grades: We had Mexican Shrimp Cocktail (B+), Kimchee fried rice (A), chilean sea bass (B+ ) and Pacifico-soy carne asada (A) and mussels (C).  

I think Sumo-Maya is a great atmosphere with some promising creative culinary ideas.  I look forward as their menu evolves.
