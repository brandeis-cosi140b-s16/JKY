Went for happy hour great selection of food and drinks. I had the sake sangria it was sooo refreshing.  We also had tacos and the spicy tuna roll. All were sooo good! Would come back if in town again. The only thing is that the cocktails rang up on the wrong price it was quickly fixed but glad we caught the mistake. Also only valet parking it's complimentary but I still rather park my own car.
