First things first: Make a reservation. I decided to play it safe and reserve a table for 6:00 p.m. on Saturday evening. At first I thought I was probably over-cautious with a reservation so early, but the dining room was packed! I think the only available seating was around the bar, which was humming.

As everyone else says, the space is open, colorful, breezy and beautiful. I loved every little detail--the vases, lights, knick-knacks, intricate metal candle holders, all with a heavy dose of bright magenta pink and orange. It was trendy and welcoming and just right. The open garage door walls made for perfect summer dinner ambiance.

Our server was sweet and explained the menu thoroughly, and gave us some recommendations. Our haul:

-Sake sangria for me: sake, cucumber vodka, ginger, other assortment of flavors to make for an absolutely refreshing cocktail

-Traditional guacamole (I'm eyeballing the pomegranate/dried fruit gauc for next time) and house-fried chips. This was magnificent. The queso fresco and citrus notes of the chunky guac made it some of the best I've ever had in a restaurant. To be honest, I think it's a little silly that you only receive 5 chips in total (and they are amazing--crispy and perfectly seasoned) and another order of chips is $1. But I don't want that to take away from how delicious this dish was.

-Mushroom tacos: Perfect little street tacos with AMAZING smoky-grilled mushrooms. These were perfection. I could eat about 10 of these, if left to my own devices. I put a little leftover guacamole on mine---tastebud party.

-Shishito peppers: Shishitos have become a personal obsession of mine over the past year and if they are on the menu, you can bet I will order them. The ample portion came tossed in a delicious soy caramel glaze. Word to the wise, these are marked as Vegetarian on their menu, but are topped with bonito flake (dried fish flakes). Seeing as I'm becoming increasingly "meh" in my vegetarianism, I just ate the ones on the bottom. I wasn't passing up these beauts!

Finally, I chose the sumo green roll to round out the meal. A perfect portion of a veggie roll, topped with a tasty tomatillo salsa. Boyfriend had the lamb chop, which I thought was a teensy bit tiny for $12, but he said it was absolutely delicious. 

We thought we couldn't handle any other food, but then our gal ran through the dessert list. HOLY. We ended up on their take of a tres leches cake, topped with toasted whipped cream, drenched in what seemed like melted ice cream (I'm sure there is a more fancy word for this) with a side of chocolate crispies (again, I'm sure something fancier than what I'm describing). It was honestly? Life changing. The other desserts sounded just as amazing. Mexican chocolate lava cake with a horchata drizzle? Trio of paletas?!

All in all, what a perfect addition to the neighborhood. If I'm feeling like a special occasion dinner, I'm probably choosing Sumo Maya!
