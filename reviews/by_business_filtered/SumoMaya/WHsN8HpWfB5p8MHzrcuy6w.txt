We ate so much while here. The rock shrimp sushi roll than the beef tacos. The entrees were the pork belly ramen noodles and the Chinese crab garlic noodles. Everything was delicious. I loved the atmosphere. There is a large tree in the middle of the restaurant that you almost don't even notice because there is so much going on. All the food was beautifully displayed on the plate.
