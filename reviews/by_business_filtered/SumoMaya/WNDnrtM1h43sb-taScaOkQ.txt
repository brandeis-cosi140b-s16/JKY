The surroundings are an eclectic blend of cowboy and a sort of hip LA vibe. The bartenders wear black, almost ballet-like, form fitting clothing. Our waiter was very attentive and able to rattle through the menu at lightening speed. He spent a considerable amount of time talking about what to order--almost to a fault. Service is family style with a warning that if you order individual plates they may not come out together. We ordered the higher end tenderloin dish with a mushroom sauce to share. The sauce was overly salty and a few of my pieces of not chew-worthy. The salmon sushi was the best selection and enjoyed it. We tried the Pad Thai--a mistake. The noddles were slightly overcooked and the dish lacked flavor. We also had a beef dish with onions and leaks in a brown sauce that was good but not great. Overall, this is a place to be seen, especially for older singles, and to drive up in a fancy car, but not a place for true foodies.
