First time there and loved it.  First I need to say that I am all about ambiance and vibe when it comes to liking a restaurant.  I like action, openness, colors, TVs, class and service.  This place had all of the above.  I only tried a limited selection of food but I hope to go back and try a lot more.  The guacamole and shishinto peppers were good but the Bacon Wrapped Dates were excellent.  What I liked most is the Atmosphere.  This place was well put together.  It was trendy but not smug. The service was excellent.  Having spent some time in the "Industry" myself, it was a joy to watch management helping out the servers running cocktails and taking drink orders if needed.  Well done guys. I will be back and hope to have a similar experience.
