Made reservations through Open Table for Friday night at 7:45 pm and was very busy with people waiting. Drove up to complimentary valet parking. As we walked in there was at the counter a DJ playing his music and the receptionist just standing there where I did not know who she was or if she was there just to be seen.

The restaurant was very loud and a fun and excitement vibe. We checked in and were seated within a few minutes.

The service was very good and helpful as she explained the menu very thoroughly.

We decided to order the Korean Tacos, Chilean Sea Bass and the Lobster and Crab Dynamite. Although all the portions were like tapas the food was very good.

The Korean Tacos were the size of street tacos but were packed with meat and other condiments.

The Chilean Sea Bass was excellent and grill with the little bit of crispy skin. The portion was very small also but yummy.

The Lobster and Crab Dynamite was also very good and not as spicy as thought when described by our waitress.

This place is very Scottsdale to the tilt. Did not hear great things about the sushi so we passed on it tonight but next time we come back may give it a try.

Will come back but maybe for lunch.
