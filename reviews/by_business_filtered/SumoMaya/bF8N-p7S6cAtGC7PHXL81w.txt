Visited sumo maya with my girlfriend on a Tuesday night. All the tables "inside" were all reserved for the night (I would recommend reservations), however the outside tables were extremely comfortable...even in the heat of the summer. 
The green mojito came as a recommendation from the waitress. I would have never normally picked this off the menu, but what a great suggestion! It was refreshing, a little on the sweeter side, but awesome mixture of coconut and mint. I would definitely get it again. 
As for the meal, we were told that everything was served tapa style, so we decided to share a few items. The guacamole w lump crab was great, and the chips had a great flavor. We also ordered the Hamachi ceviche and the Suzuki roll. Both were delicious, however when the bill came, I was left to reflect where the worth was. Although the food was good, for $80 I wish I would have tried something over-the-top, melt in your mouth good. 
 I will come back, but I think I would try something different like the Chilean sea bass.
