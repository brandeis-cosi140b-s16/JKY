I'm not exactly sure how anyone could give this place more than 3 stars. I was shocked to find out that  sumomaya was not a fox concept, based on its extreme average-ness. I will say that it is a very nice space, and the service, while not notable at all, was fine. The food is about as unremarkable as you can get. A couple decent items and a whole lot of, well, "2 star" material. The kimchi fried rice was about the only dish that really left me feeling good about it.  Drinks were really not great either - not horrible, but again unremarkable. 

Food: Meh
Drinks: Meh
Service: decent
Ambiance: cool space, tree inside is a great look. Crowd is a bit poser-ish

The best way I can describe sumomaya is as a concept that is trying too hard, with a crowd that is trying to hard, and an execution level that isn't trying hard enough. If that makes sense lol. Super basic may be a more direct way to sum it up. Im so confused by the 4 and 5 star reviews, but hey, different strokes for different folks. I guess barely average at a higher than a average price appeals to some people. Skip this joint if you're in the area and go 30 seconds north to Roka... Or Shinbay if you're looking for something a little quieter with a set menu. Food and cocktails at Roka Akor are on a different stratosphere (in a very very good way) , the bar is GREAT,  ambiance is very sexy, and service is generally spot on.
