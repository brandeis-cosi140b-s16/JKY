Had dinner there last night. Our second visit (1st was just a drink at the bar to check it out)
Food exceeded all expectations. 
My wife and I shared the ahi tacos as an appetizer. 
I had the "el pastor" pad Thai for dinner and she had the grilled shrimp... we shared. I was concerned the el pastor with tamerind would be too sweet, but it was fantastic.  Service was perfect, fun vibe. New place to swing into when we are in that area.
