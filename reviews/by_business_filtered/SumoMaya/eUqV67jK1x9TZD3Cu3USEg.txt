Hands down- my favorite place! My first time going was a Saturday night (highly recommend making a reservation on weekend nights) & the atmosphere was breathtaking. From the moment you walk in the door you will notice a huge tree in the center of the dining area. Their bar is large and has tvs surrounding it. On this particular night, there was a DJ who played fun and lively music that had music videos on the tv screens. Their Mexican-Japanese fusion food has never disappointed me. I've enjoyed their pork belly raman, street tacos and sushi. This menu doesn't have a single item on it that doesn't sound appetizing. The staff has always been very knowledgeable of food items, which has been helpful for avoiding food allergies. Any chance that I get I am recommending this restaurant to family, friends, and clients.
