Returned here for dinner on New Year's Eve.  This time I had a great experience.  All of the food was great and the portions were large.  Maybe a little to big but I'm not sure if that's a thing.  They had a special menu that night that was five courses with plenty of different diverse choices for each.  I was able to have sushi and steak and potatoes.   The flan cheesecake was a great finish to the meal.
