"Oh so SodaSopa"

Just because it wasn't for me, doesn't mean it's poorly operated or doesn't execute its business model well. Overall, service was pretty excellent (waitress seemed annoyed a tad, like we weren't  spending enough or something and hence the 4 stars). Beer was cold. glasses were clean. Seated quickly. Well organized and managed extremely well. 

Friday night at 10pm. Late 20s/early 30s crowd with the mixed divorced mid 40s/50s. Obviously a place people go to be seen. There isn't anything about the decor, music, or people that isn't cliche white Scottsdale Millennial with disposable income. 

We didn't try the food. The mixture of Asian/Mexican seems contrived to me but everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.
