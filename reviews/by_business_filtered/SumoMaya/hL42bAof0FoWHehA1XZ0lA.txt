I'm generally not a fusion fan - I find often they try to hard to be different and don't manage to make things that are really GOOD.  SumoMaya manages to do both, impressively, I might add.  Add to the mix that the ingredients that they use are obviously selected with care and are of excellent quality.  Presentation is really well done also.  We liked it so much we went 2 days in a row for lunch.  Both times service was good and food was exceptional.  We tried a bunch of different things - some specialty rolls, guacamole with pomegranate, Korean bbq tacos... everything was at least good and most were excellent.  The menu is fun and interesting.  I wanted to try it all.

It isn't cheap but it is well worth it.  I don't know that I would enjoy it for dinner because I can see it probably being crowded and loud.  I'm old :)   But for lunch it was excellent and will be my first choice any time I am in the area.
