WOW.  Peg and I were curious about this place when it first began to surface. The adage about eating with your eyes was noted over a hundred years ago but it has never been more apparent than when you walk into Sumo Maya. Walking into the Jeff Lowe inspired and created atmosphere was very impressive and inviting. We've been there twice since it opened, trying to sample a variety of the Mex-Asian fusion. The street tacos are very good (we had taco carnitas) they were fresh and delicious. The Mexican-style summer corn topped with popcorn was tasty and the crispy calamari was sampled both times...and will be again!  I must say that the bacon wrapped medjool dates were incredibly flavorful and instantly addictive..and they were also repeated and will likely become a steady accompaniment.. Sushi is presented beautifully and so fresh tasting. The New York strip was very flavorful and as tender as it was, the duck breast was just as comforting. The open concept kitchen is done a lot with new restaurants, and this was especially inviting and playful...the full kitchen to the sushi station. Chef Matt and crew were engaged with both cooking and guests. John was our server (we asked for him specifically the second time) and he is the perfect blend of attentive but not gratuitous. The heart and soul of the place is Chef Herb Wilson, and his pedigree is very impressive.  Tai Hunt (GM) and Alex Davis (Mgr) were obviously involved in customer satisfaction and provided insight into making customer-services a priority.  We are thrilled to see this place hit the ground running, and will add it to our short list of must returns. Congrats to German Osio and the team!
