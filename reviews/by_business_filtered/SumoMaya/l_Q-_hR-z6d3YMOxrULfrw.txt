Oh my god! Absolutely delicious food across the menu. Our server couldn't of been anymore friendly and personable. The food was on point and just exploded in the mouth. Customer service was phenomenal when it came to a small dissatisfaction with a dish. We felt the delicious chips with the guac were a little on the chewy side. They took them back instantly, fixed the issue and comped the item on the bill. I stressed to the server that I was not complaining and didn't feel like it needed special attention but they still took it off the bill. Wow! All around A+. 

Hamachi Cerviches is to die for!

By far the best restaurant stop while visiting Scottsdale in the last 4 days. We will be back.
