Had dinner there last night with my husband on date night.  Great meal and great fun.  Yes, it is loud but it had a great energy going and we could hear each other and the waitress.  The menu can be a bit confusing but just ask for suggestions.  We started off with the night's special ceviche which was dorado and it was amazing.  Best ceviche ever.  Small portions but that allowed us to sample many different dishes.  Another surprise dish was the miso, sugarcane sea bass.  So many great flavors in one dish.  We had the Maya roll and again that was quite tasty.  Loved the Summer Corn as well.  The popped corn gives it great texture.  Guacamole with crab was good but next time I may pass on that to save room for other dishes.  My Green Tea cocktail was refreshing and not too strong.  We had 2 desserts, the tres leche  cake and a fruit crisp with ice cream,  both very good.  We had attentive service and did not feel rushed.  As this is a tapas style place, we enjoyed ordering as we went along.  It is a little more costly but well worth the quality of food.  Can't wait to go back with friends
