Great place to come for tapas and drinks! My sister and I tried to come here like a month and a half ago, not realizing they only serve drinks between lunch and dinner. Unfortunately we were hungry and she is not of age yet haha so we decided to try again!
I love all the lanterns outside of the restaurant. It looks really awesome, especially when they were lit up at night. I also loved the big tree inside. We walked in and were seated right away, even though it was pretty crowded. We sat at the sushi bar which I thought was cool! It was fun watching them roll the sushi. 
Our waiter was nice, did a good job! I ordered a cocktail with rum and ginger beer and it was really spicy! But it was a good sized drink which was great. I just wouldn't order it with something spicy! We started off with the traditional guacamole too, which was served with sopapillas. Guac was a tad bland for my taste, but I ate it with a spoon once I ran out of sopapillas, so I can't complain. My drink and guacamole was served pretty quickly. I was debating between the mushroom tacos or the veggie sushi, went for the tacos. Tacos were absolutely fabulous, I wish I could have had more than two! Yum! My sister got kimchi noodles, and they let her substitute chicken for crab. She liked it but it was very spicy for her.
It was real expensive. Everything is fresh and such, but very pricey for a poor preschool teacher like myself. But nice for a once in a while treat.
