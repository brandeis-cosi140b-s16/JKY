Came here for lunch twice during my stay. Nice well-lit airy location with trendy decor. First time around I tried the Guacamole with lump crab meat - amazing! It comes with a stack of tostadas and was extremely filling. Second time around I ordered the spicy tuna tacos and Steak Pepito, both solid choices. I wish the Steak Pepito had more Avocado, other than that it was very satisfying.
