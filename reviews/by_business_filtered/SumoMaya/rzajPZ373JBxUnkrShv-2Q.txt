First of all, German Osio has outdone himself. We LOVE all of his restaurants and have always frequented them, but this is a cut above. First of all, the design by Jeff Low Design (who was there and we had the pleasure of meeting him) is exquisite and a definite stand out in Scottsdale. Big Daddy and I definitely felt as if we were in a New York or Tokyo restaurant. Sleek, focusing on eclectic faces on chairs with a lovely tree to lighten the space. We went for lunch today but will go in for dinner within a week.  We began with two lovely cocktails- Bill DeGroot did a great job with fresh flavors. I loved my Pineapple Pisco. Big Daddy had first the grapefruit concoction and loved it and second, a Green tree cocktail (sorry don't remember the names). They were light, lovely and fresh. Chef Herb Wilson brings a big city vibe to Scottsdale with this menu. Mexican Asian Fusion sounds challenging at first. We began with Head on Shrimp that were superb in a garlic and jalopeno sauce. I could not go in without ordering that again. Secondly, we had the Kimchi Fried Rice. We have eaten fried race all over the world and this was absolutely delicious. Crispy, slightly spicy, perfectly cooked with nuances. DIVINE. We had two orders- it was that good. We also tried the Mexican Pho  which is a red chile based soup. Delicious and complex, it filled us up. We will be in within the week to sample the dinner menu which looks divine. "Sparkles'", the nickname of our well informed server made the meal. She was able to describe the food in very accurate detail and was very concerned with our satisfaction.

All in all, a superior lunch experience in Scottsdale. The friendliness of  the house and the divine food made this a thumbs up for us. Keep it up Chef Herb! Laurie and Rodney Malone
