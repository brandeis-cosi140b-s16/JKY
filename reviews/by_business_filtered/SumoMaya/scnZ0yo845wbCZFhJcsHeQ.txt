Tried it on a whim last night and was blown away by all the elements u hope for in a restaurant. Lively atmosphere, beautifully decorated, friendly, knowledgeable staff, great location, and last but not least SUPER delicious unique foods at an affordable rate. My new favorite Scottsdale spot. Try the curry muscles!
