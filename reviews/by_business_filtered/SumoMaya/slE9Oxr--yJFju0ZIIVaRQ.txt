SumoMaya = the perfect mix of Mexican and Asian in a trendy and fun atmosphere.  I've been several times... each of them was a girls night out, and it's a great destination for that -- especially if your party is into sharing food, enjoying a few drinks, and being entertained by fellow diners and the Scottsdale scene.

This place offers a solid drink menu filled with unique and tasty cocktails, a fabulous selection of wine, beer, and tons of tequila too.  I just now realized that this is likely due to the fact that their Beverage Director is Bill DeGroot, who is no stranger to the Valley's cocktail scene; this guy is quite an expert in his field!

I'm a huge fan of both Mexican and Asian flavors... I totally recommend doing a mix when you go here.  Some of my fave menu items are:
-Pomegranate Guacamole
-Sumo "Chopped" Salad
-Korean Beef Tacos
-Wild Mushroom Tacos
-Shishito Peppers
-Miso Eggplant

**And then depending on how adventurous your palate is when it comes to sushi, you can't go wrong with the following basics:
-"Real" California Roll
-Salmon-Avocado
-Spicy Tuna

Or if you are feeling like something a little bit more unique when it comes to flavor, go for any of these:
-Suzuki Roll: spicy tuna, avocado, masago, chipotle aioli
-Apple Salmon Roll
-Or any of their other specialty rolls, all of which sound awesome.  I especially look forward to trying both the Billionaire Roll (japanese waygu beef, snow crab, asparagus, soy aioli, truffle garlic butter, gold flake) and the Sumo Green Roll (wood grilled mushrooms, avocado, crispy plantain chip, veg. caviar+ aji amarillo) on a future visit.  The meet and veggies will balance each other out, right?!

The brunch menu looks interesting as well... especially if you're in the mood for bottomless mimosas, micheladas, or bloody mary's with your meal.  I hope to try that sometime!

A couple of things to note to keep expectations in check: SumoMaya is loud... it's difficult to hear everyone if you have a large group, so know that going in.  Also, their tap water tastes a little off... I noticed that on all of my visits.  Perhaps a tool they have to get guests to drink more cocktails?!
