I am currently sitting at the bar of this lovely new restaurant and am happy to say that my butt is the first one to have officially sat here! Huzzah! This place has a few kinks to work out, as it is opening day, first seating, but it has some serious potential. The managers/ owners graciously allowed me to try a few of their cocktails on the house and all were tasty. The clear standout is the frozen coconut mojito! Extremely delicious. I also had the coconut drink, which was very pure in coconut flavor and the passionfruit drink (10$ normal price, 8$ hh) which was gingery and smokey and overall unlike anything i have had before. Plus this place has hard a on tap... Cool stuff. For food we trued the following:

dates wrapped in bacon - very tasty... How could it not be? It's a date with cheese and chorizo inside and wrapped in bacon on top of a foie gras sauce.... Come on!

chicken tacos- very flavorful but tiny... I would like more for sure!

traditional guac- flavorful and plentiful, but served with weird tostada type chips... Good tasting and clearly house made, but awkward to eat.

pollo chcharrones- so yummy with the  miso mustard... Nicely done!

this place is a definite return to place, reasonable prices, good drinks, nice hh, and interesting food (not to mention cute decor). 

check it out yelpers!

ps, first!!
