I came here with a group of 8 for dinner. Not only was the food delicious but the service was excellent. They were very accommodating, suggested items to share, and very knowledgeable on their menu. We ended up with about 15 different dishes and shared everything and it was all good. The only drawback  is that it is really noisy and it is difficult to hear conversations. I would suggest that the restaurant put noise dampeners in the ceilings to help reduce the noise level. In looking at the clientele, you could tell that this was the place to be. I would definitely come back here again.
