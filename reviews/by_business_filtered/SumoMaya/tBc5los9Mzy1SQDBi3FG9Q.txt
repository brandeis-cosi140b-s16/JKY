After having 2 stellar meals on previous visits, we decided to head to Sumomaya at the last minute to ring in the New Year with one of their famous concoctions from the bar. After settling into our seats at the bar, my daughter was carded and, despite the fact that she is 22, they refused to serve her a drink because of her ID being "vertical". She was humiliated and embarrassed. I understand the need for laws, especially when preventing under age drinking, but she is of legal drinking age..... And she was with her mother, for heaven's sake! It ruined what had been a wonderful evening, celebrating the New Year. The General Manager was completely inflexible, citing that the law was new ( he said it was instituted in Nov, when it was July) when we told him she had been served on our two previous visits. 

We won't be back!
