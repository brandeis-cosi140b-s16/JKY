The mango habanero sauce/salsa thing is #bombdotcom. A hint of sweetness at first with a huge lingering kick. A very balanced combination of both. Food was a good mix of interesting and different flavors. The size is smaller (almost like tapas) so it is easier to try numerous menu items. Pricing is moderate. A bit pricy for some items but def nothing outrageous.  

The staff was friendly and attentive, though that may be because we arrived shortly after they opened for the day. Didn't have to contend with too many other customers at the time which was a huge bonus.

Seeing as the restaurant is new, there were a few execution issues I noticed with our meal. The sea bass was overly seasoned and I kept looking for something to help cut the saltiness. The garnishes on the plate didn't help much in that respect. The overall flavor and concept of the dish was nice though. Def would try again.Their sushi was beautifully presented but wasn't rolled (or packed, since the pieces were square) very tightly. It often fell apart as we tried to pick them up. Aside for these couple of items, it was a nice experience.

HH daily so I'll def be back.
