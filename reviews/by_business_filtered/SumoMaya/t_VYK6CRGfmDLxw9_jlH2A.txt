Great atmosphere and everything on the menu is unique and amazing!! Service is hit and miss sadly. I've had great service all the times I've dined here, except for last time. I'm going to assume maybe it was an off day and still give them 5 stars since it was always great the previous times. Worth checking out, even if it's just for a before/after cocktail!!
