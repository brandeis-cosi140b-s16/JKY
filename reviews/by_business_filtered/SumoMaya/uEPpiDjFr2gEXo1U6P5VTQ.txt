Ate here for Father's Day. The place was fairly full. We were told we could sit outside on the patio, wait about 40 minutes, or sit at a counter facing the kitchen. We chose the counter. Our server was obviously quite busy, yet she was pleasant and efficient. Because it was a holiday we were only able to order from a brunch menu. We all chose the same dish, an omelet with crab, red onion, and avocado. The food was tasty although it seemed to take quite some time to be served. The presentation was nicely done. I had hoped to order fried chicken skins but I will have to come back for them. Overall, I'd rate this place an 8 out of 10.
