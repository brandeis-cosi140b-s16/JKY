Disappointing experience; food was good, but service was less than stellar, which ruined the entire experience. Waiter offered celebratory shots/cake for our party, and proceeded to charge for these items that he offered (but were not requested). Waiter was apologetic, which was appreciated by our party; however, manager's reaction was completely inappropriate -- accusatory, unapologetic, and rude. As we exited, waiter who did not serve our party made a rude comment, as well. All in all, a disappointing experience...the food was good, but I wouldn't support this restaurant again, as there are comparable options nearby.
