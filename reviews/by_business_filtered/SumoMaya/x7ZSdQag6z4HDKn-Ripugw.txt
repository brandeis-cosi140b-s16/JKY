Great ambience and interesting food with the whole texmex-asian fusion concept. Cool indoor/outdoor spot for drinks and appetizers. This place is loud and full of energy so not the type of place you'd want to go for a quiet, romantic dinner. It gets busy so call ahead for a reservation. We went for a birthday dinner and they surprised the birthday girl with a slice of cake lit with sparklers :)

To me, this is more of a tapas spot where you share most dishes rather than order your own individual meal. That being said, if you're super hungry, you'll have to order a bunch because the portions aren't huge. I'll definitely return, especially to enjoy the vibrant ambience. Next time I'll probably go to enjoy drinks and appetizers rather than a full dinner.
