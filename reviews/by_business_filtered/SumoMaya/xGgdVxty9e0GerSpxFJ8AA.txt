Was so anxious to have a meal there, place looks ok lots of ppl in kitchen, bar looks great the super large tv's are impressive.  

Ordered the tempura cod tacos...what a disappointment, they were just OK and way too small.

Had a passion fruit drink...again just OK.

This was Sunday and it was not packed but we still had to wave the server down for a 2nd bellini.

I probably  won't go there again there are too many better places to go spend my money at.
