We went to Sumo Maya for the first time last week to celebrate my brother's birthday and it was fantastic!  The atmosphere and d√©cor was awesome, very lively...the perfect place to celebrate a birthday...the food was unique and delicious.  It was fun tasting all the different appetizers.  Their guacamole is amazing and so is their corn.  All the entrees were delicious as well.  Overall we had a great experience and will definitely return.
