Not a place I would go again.  it took almost 40 minutes for the server to bring a dried-out piece of lime for my water.  the food was meh, nothing special, unless you order the kimchi fried rice, which my friend did.

If I ever wondered what zombie guts from The Walking Dead must taste like, then it's probably this dish.  the "aroma" made me want to puke.

Thanks, but no thanks.
