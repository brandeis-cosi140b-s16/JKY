Incredible, incredible flavors. We were a large party and gave our server a price per head. She brought us a seemingly non-stop variety of dishes from Filet to Shrimp to Sea Bass.  There were guacamole varieties that blew us away. This is a must if you like the flavors of Mexican and or Asian cuisine.
