I thought this place was OK. There drinks were mehh.... I got a margarita and they made it strong with orange juice, which I thought was odd. 

WARNING FOOD PORTIONS ARE VERY VERY SMALL!!! I asked the server for something that was NOT spicy because I'm a wuss when it comes to hot food. She recommended 2 things that were incredibly spicy! My boyfriend loves spicy and he got the pad Thai and liked it okay, nothing great about it though. But he thought my food was MUCH spicier! I then ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, which was amazing. However, I only got 4 small chunks of meat on a kabob stick for $14. For that to be a normal entree I would've need like 3 kabob sticks = 12 bites = $42. The sea bass is the reason I'm rating this 3 stars, because that would be the only reason I would go back. 

I feel this place strongly relies on the atmosphere to carry it. The decorations were very cool. There's even a tree in the middle of the restaurant. But the chairs were super hard! They clearly want to turn tables quickly.
