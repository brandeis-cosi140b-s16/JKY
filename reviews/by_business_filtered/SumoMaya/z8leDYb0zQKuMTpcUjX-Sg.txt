Probably not fair to review since we left without eating.  It was so LOUD.  The music was shaking the glasses.  The server had to bend over the table and shout  "do you want STILL WATER OR BOTTLED WATER..". That did, it we were out the damn door.

WHY do place feel they have to make you DEAF to eat there??????  Really?

Maybe I will order take out if they agree to bring it out to the parking lot.   Oh, and that is already a nightmare, with another restaurant yet to open there soon..
