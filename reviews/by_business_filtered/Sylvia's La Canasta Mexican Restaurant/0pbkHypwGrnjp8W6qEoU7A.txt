Don't get me wrong, I love the ORIGINAL LA CANASTA off 7th avenue and Grant and this is the sister restaurant but the service sucks! 

I had to wait 15 minutes for a waiter.  Once he came, he seemed like he was on one angering my table along with two other tables (who walked out).  We pretty much got full of chips and salsa.  He forgot our order, had to come back twice and then took 10 minutes to take our debit card.  

I love the food but the constant turning around of how this restaurant conducts business. I would like some consistency.  

The consistency of the food between the original restaurant and sister restaurant is what is on point. 

I will drive out of my way to go to the original restaurant. 

If you're going for the food, go to Sylvia's, if you're going for the service, drive to South Phoenix.
