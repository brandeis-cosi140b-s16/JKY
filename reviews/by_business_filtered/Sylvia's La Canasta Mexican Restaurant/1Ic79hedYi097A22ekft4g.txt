Whenever I think Mexican food, I think Sylvia's. No other ideas come into my head. I LOVE coming here when I'm in the mood for some authentic Mexican. Everytime I've gone, I've received great service - timely delivery and drink refills. The servers I have had have been very understanding and friendly when I have trouble pronouncing stuff on the menu - I've been to places where I've gotten made fun of by the waiters for pronouncing something wrong!! The food, of course, is DELICIOUS. Perfect proportions, perfect taste. Love Sylvia's.
