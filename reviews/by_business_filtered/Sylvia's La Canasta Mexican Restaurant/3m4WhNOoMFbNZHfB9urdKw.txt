This restaurant has a permanent home in my childhood memories. I grew up in Phoenix, and just about every other Sunday, we'd have dinner at La Canasta. My families favorite ( and still my own ) was the Green chili Beef Burrito, Enchillada Style. So tasty!! 
For desert, I always had the sopapilla with powdered sugar and honey.
Whenever I am in Phoenix, I MUST eat there when i arrive in town, and before i leave!!
