We have eaten at Sylvia's many times over the past few years and there are always two constants...the food is decent and the restaurant is hot as hell. 

Breakfast, lunch, or dinner, you will usually get a good meal for a good price. All restaurants do have their off days and Sylvia's is no exception, but we have been pleased more often than not. 

The things that really irk me about the place is the fact that they charge an additional 75 cents if you want a "to go" cup. I understand that everything costs money, but 75 cents is a little steep. Also, the place is really hot everytime we eat there. In fact, that is one of the biggest reasons we avoid the place. I don't know if their air conditioner has been broken for four years, or if the management is just too dang cheap to keep their customers comfortable.
