For years now, I've been enjoying the food here with my swim teammates and various groups of friends. The restaurant is cozy, service is friendly, and the food is well-seasoned, generous, and rather inexpensive. Lately I've been coming here for their menudo, a dish I didn't care for when I tried them in other places; but this restaurant serves a great menudo on the weekends - so good especially during cold weather. I write this in a state of gastronomic bliss after having one of those steaming bowls of goodness, which came with perfect complements of lemon wedges, chopped scallions and cilantro, and of course their warm, freshly prepared tortilla chips.
