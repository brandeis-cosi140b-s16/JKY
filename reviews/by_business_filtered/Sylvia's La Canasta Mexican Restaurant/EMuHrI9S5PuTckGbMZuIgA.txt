Save your money... terrible overpriced food and the worst service.  Sylvia needs to stop hiring her inept servers to work there. They have destroyed this place's reputation.   DO NOT GO HERE!!  The staff does not care about the quality of service or food they are sending out.  I know for sure that what I was served was recooked meat.  It is only a matter of time before they kill someone with their filthy poor work standards.  Also, there was dried up food stuck to my menu.  Gross!!
