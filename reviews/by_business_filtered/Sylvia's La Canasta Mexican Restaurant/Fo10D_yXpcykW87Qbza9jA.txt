I've been going to Sylvia's for years.  Now I live in the neighborhood and go at least twice a month.  It's very average Mexican food for Phoenix.  Over the years Sylvia's food quality has gotten worse and their prices have gotten higher.  

Pro:
Good for large groups
Chips and salsa bar
Catering is great for parties at home
Large patio

Con:
Too much dark meat in chicken entrees
Dinner prices are too expensive for what you get
The signs posted by management that hang all over the place telling customers what to do
Obnoxious paint colors
