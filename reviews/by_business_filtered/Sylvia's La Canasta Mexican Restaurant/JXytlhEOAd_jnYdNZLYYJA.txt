What happened? I haven't been here in a while having moved out of the neighborhood. This place used to be so good. Today, it was not good.

The service - one star. Even though it was not crowded or busy, my waitress moved at a frenzied pace that would make a cup of coffee nervous. I think maybe she had a couple lines for breakfast. 

The table was filthy. It looked like it hadn't had a good cleaning in years, but also was not wiped down from the previous diners. There was lettuce and used sugar packets left behind. I asked for a couple extra napkins and cleaned it myself. 

Food - one star. This place has always had my favorite salsa and still does. The chips however were pathetic. Most of the basket were wet with grease, cold and chewey. Not good. If you cant get chips right, then just shut the doors and go home. 

Not sure what's happened here but this place is no longer being managed. It's a question of trust at this point. So many things were wrong, I can't trust that the food won't hurt me.

Sorry to have to say it Sylvia, but I won't be back.
