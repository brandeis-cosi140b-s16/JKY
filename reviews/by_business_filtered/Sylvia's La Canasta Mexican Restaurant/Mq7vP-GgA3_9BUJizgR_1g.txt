If you come here expecting good service, in the exact same fashion I'd laugh at a crappy comedian. The service is awful, they forget minor things all the time and give seemingly smart ass answers when you have questions.

Me: "What's Fritanga?"
Her: "It's an omelette."
Me: "I know it's a %$#@in' omelette as it SAYS fritanga OMELETTE. But what is fritanga!?"

Or:

Me: "Can I get lime instead of lemon?"
Her: "It comes with it."
Me: "It says lemon comes with it. I am asking for lime."

I THINK it might have to do more with comprehension than anything else. I hope they don't spit in my food.

However, the food is great. I am giving it 3 stars due to horrible service. At least it's not really slow. Their beans are consistently delicious, and their red chile is the best in town. I also really enjoy their chile relleno, but their salsas could use some work.

Go to the one on 7th Ave and Grant. It's much better for some reason.
