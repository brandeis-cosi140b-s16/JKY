Sylvia's has been my favorite Mexican restaurant for the last five years and counting.  It is my go-to place for delicious enchiladas, tacos, taquitos, chimis... okay you get the picture. I just can't find anything negative about this place.  Who cares if it is counter-service? Does that change the taste of the food.  Uh, no way! 

You get your food in record time, and it is always muy delicioso. The prices are very reasonable and they have an extensive menu with a variety of lunch specials.  My all time favorite entree is their beef tacos.  The meat is very tender with unique seasoning that has a kick to it but isn't overwhelming. 

Their patio is great for nice-weather days and if your lucky, you'll get some live mariachi music while enjoying your meal. I am never disappointed when I visit Sylvia's, and lunch or dinner there always makes my day!
