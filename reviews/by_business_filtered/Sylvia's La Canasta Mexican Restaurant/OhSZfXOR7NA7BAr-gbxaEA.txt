In my search for the best green chili burro in Phoenix, I always end up coming back here. Their burro is in my top 3 for sure. To be honest I haven't eaten much else here. It's a comfortable place, with a nice shaded patio and cheap beer. I like their chips and salsa, not the usual fair. It's a good place to drop in and grab a quick bite. Margaritas are not impressive, but technically you have to order those from Mateo's next door.
