This is the original La Canasta visited by President Bill Clinton.  The restaurant is quite small and cramped, but the food is excellent.  For a very resonably priced lunch, try the Workman's special (it's on the menu). I always get the red chili Workman's, but it also comes in green chili as well.  The Workman's comes with red chili meat, beans and rice for a mere $6.49.  It cannot be beat. The staff is very nice, which is a plus in these days of restaurant chains. This place is family owned and operated. To avoid the lunch crowds, you may want to leave for lunch a little early.  The restarant is close to downtown Phoenix for those working downtown or near the Capitol. For those going in a group, be aware they won't do separate checks, and they won't split the check out at the counter.  I guess due to thefts, you cannot pay at the table, you have to pay at the counter on the way out.
