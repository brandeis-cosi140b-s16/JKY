If I could give zero stars I would.  There was a time when Sylvia's was a consistent but not mentionable Mexican food.  I have no idea what happened but the ordering system is different.  We waited 10 minutes to get seated by one of what appeared to be 2 women working the whole place.  My mother and I were seated, she is 88 and asked for directions to restroom and ignored.  She found it on her own.  We waites for another 20 minutes before we got chips and salsa and our order taken by one of the two women.  Mom got a beef machaca chimichanga she enjoyed.  It was big and the beef was tasty and seasoned well.  I got the chicken flautas.  I. Can't. Even.  These were canned chicken - unseasoned - rolled in a flour (not corn as indicated) tortilla.  Cutting through these tubes if fried chicken torpedoes was an adventure in civilized eating.  I went paleo and picked them up and ate them like a rib.  The taste was non existent.  As we waited for another 20 minutes to have our bill brought I saw that there was a help wanted NOW sign in every window.  I also saw La Pi√±ata moving in across the street and realized we were there us the death throes of a mediocre mexican restaurant.
