As far as the breakfast goes, Sylvia's kicks some major arse. It is definitely one of my favorite spots to hit in Phoenix for some b-fast. Lunch or dinner, I cannot comment on, as I only go here for breakfast.

The place has a rockin chips & salsa bar. We start out our Mexi-break-feast by piling up some regular tortilla chips along with some tostada chips in a bowl. For dippin, they've got a red hot sauce, a traditional red salsa with tomato, onions, cilantro, peppers, etc and they also now have a creamy, spicy guaca-salsa, which is delicious!

Their coffee is unique and very good. It is a cinnamon spiced blend, which complements their food very well.

They have many Mexican breakfast items that you would expect, and some that you might not. One of our favorites is the breakfast quesadilla, which is pretty large & perfect for splitting with someone else. This tasty dish includes eggs, cheese, green chiles & some other stuff.

Their hashbrowns are delish and come with green chiles and cheese on top. Order a side of those to complement your meal.

The only reason I didn't give Sylvia's 5/5 is due to their service, which can sometimes be lame. Everything is ordered at the counter (no waiter/waitress) and sometimes there is no one to be found when you need something else. They can also be a pain to deal with if they mess up your order. Today we ordered a side of guacamole & we specifically asked for it on the side. Instead, they put a small amount of guac inside our breakfast quesadilla. When I tried to get a side after the fact due to their screwup, they gave me some flack. Try to improve your customer service a bit Sylvia's.
