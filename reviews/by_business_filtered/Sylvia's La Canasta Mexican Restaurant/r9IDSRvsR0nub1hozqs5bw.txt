I have gone to Sylvia's for many years and it is apparent there is new management who have taken over the business.  When I came in, I was seated at a table over by the television set, which was fine.  I was facing the window, so to my right was a group of men already eating their lunch and to my left, was an empty table.  I was given a menu when I sat down,but  no chips, drink order or anything.  A few minutes after I was seated, the same lady seated a man and a woman and immediately gave them their chips.  The next thing I see, they had their drinks and then that same lady (in glasses) was taking their order.  I still had not even received any chips.  I was somewhat ticked off at this point and picked up my purse and left.  I did not say anything, because I am NOT the waitress, I was the customer.  Oh well, they not only lost one customer, but three others because my family would go there too.
