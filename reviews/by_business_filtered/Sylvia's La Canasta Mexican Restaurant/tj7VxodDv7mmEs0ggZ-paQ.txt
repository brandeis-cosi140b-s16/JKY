Sylvia's is one of a few decent Mexican restaurants where you can sit at a real table to take your time eating instead of scarfing your food at a teeny diner-style table, in your car, or waiting until you get home.  

Their new cost-cutting measures aren't very customer friendly, but everyone is pinching pennies these days, and Sylvia's is my neighbor. I think there is a sign that says Sylvia's doesn't use lard. 

Sylvia's also sells both regular and mini-tamales in bulk, which are great for parties. I've ordered the minis and then frozen the extras. They were a big hit (I ordered extra).
