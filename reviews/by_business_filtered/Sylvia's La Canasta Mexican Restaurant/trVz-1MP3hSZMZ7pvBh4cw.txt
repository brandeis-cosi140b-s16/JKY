I was introduced to La Canasta 7 years ago and I've been a regular since!  Almost a native of AZ I've had some great and then some horrible Mexican food, it's pretty sad when you think Macayos is the best you are going to get.  But some central Phoenix friends dragged me there one Sunday afternoon and I've been a fan since.  Their portions are amazing for theprice! I always order the #1 lunch, which is a big taco, tostada and a tamale for $5.50!  This includes all the chips and salsa you can eat.  Their hot sauce style salsa in the squeeze bottle is seriously to die for. I would just squirt it down my throat if I wasn't worried about people staring.  I relocated to Washington 2.5 years ago and deeply regret that I can only get La Canasta when I come to AZ to visit!  We were there for a month in April and went to La Canasta 6 or 7 times and brought 2 pints of hot sauce home!  My favorite breakfast is the Nana's Special and my favorite dinner is the taco, tostada and tamale.  Give it a try... but beware they close early.  They run a brisk take out business, but then you miss out on all that free chips and salsa!
