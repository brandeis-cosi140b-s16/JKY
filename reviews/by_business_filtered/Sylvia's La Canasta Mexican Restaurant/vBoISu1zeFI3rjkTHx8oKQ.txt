Average mexican. Kind of cute little strip mall and a little above average ambience. It's good food, but not necessarily great food. I would say that it is fairly priced though.

I've been here twice and both times there were some strange smells going down.  Anyone know what that's about? Also - what's the deal with mateo's? is it open? isn't it? what's going on there? i don't understand. Input always welcome!
