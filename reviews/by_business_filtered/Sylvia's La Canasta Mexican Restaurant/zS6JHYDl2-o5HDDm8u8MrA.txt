Mediocre food and the service was comically bad. The refried beans tasted like they came out of a can and warmed up in a microwave. The chile relleno was bland and mealy. 

I kept having to ask for the server to bring my iced tea several times after she brought everyone else's drinks. 

I ordered a side of rice and beans (apparently the chile relleno doesn't come with it), which the server didn't bring when she brought the entree. I asked the server about it, and she brought just the beans. I had to ask again for the rice. 

Then she kept bringing the wrong check. One person had to ask three different times. It was absurd. I won't be back.
