I gave Yes Sir a try last night. Would I go there again?....si, senor. I got a take out order, enchilada style beef burro with the green sauce, and a couple of beef gorditas. I'm not sure if the real Mexicanos out there would approve of this place, but me being a god fearing Anglo Saxon of Irish ancestry I found it to be delicious. They even threw in some sopapillas free of charge,  probably because they liked my handsome face. Not sure if they do that for everyone. 

So if you're in the mood for some good Mexican food and you don't wanna spend a bunch of pesos n stuff, go down to si senor.
