So, this mexican restaurant is just like any other mexican restaurant in the valley. If you like the same ol', same ol' kind of Mexican food then you'll like this place. On the other hand I like the more modern style mexican restaurants myself. One thing that really got me and irritated the heck out of me about this place is serving the food out of a plastic tray. I feel like I'm back in Junior High School. I want real plates, round plates, I prefer squared plates but it doesn't really matter as long as they are actual plates. In conclusion, I will probably never go to this restaurant ever again. If I wanted to be served food in this manner, I would go to "Filiberto's" and get me a "number1" combo plate and then proceed to pour it into my dog dish and then eat it (save some money this way).
