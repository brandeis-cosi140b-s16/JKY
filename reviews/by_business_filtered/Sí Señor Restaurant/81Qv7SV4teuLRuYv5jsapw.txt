You know you are in the right place when It is bustling with people on just a random Monday evening. 

The menu has an ample assortment of dinners and combination platters, it made it really hard to finally pick a plate. Everyone in my party was raving about their dinners, all the food was top notch. Plus I really enjoyed the different choices of sauces to use on the enchiladas and different items. The margaritas were also dangerously good.

 I may have found a new favorite Mexican food place in Arizona.
