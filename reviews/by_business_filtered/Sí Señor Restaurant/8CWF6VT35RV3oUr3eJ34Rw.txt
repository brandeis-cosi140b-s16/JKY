Being in the mood for some Mexican food and wanting to try something local and close to where I lived, figured we give this place a try. Service was good place was clean and friendly but food could have been better. I had ordered the Sopapillia plate with ground beef. The Spanish style rice seemed to be more like minute rice with the Spanish seasoning and my Sopapillia fell apart with the ground beef inside reminding me of the ground beef served at Taco Bell or some fast food chain. The ice tea was not good either tasted as if was made from tap water. I managed to make it through the meal while being constantly annoyed at the plates that my meal was served on as it is a hot plate siting inside another holding plate, but as I would eat it would shift out of the holding plate. The plates and the whole experience brought back memories of when I was younger high school/college student and I though Pancho's was great Mexican food. For the price I paid I have had better. You do however get chips and Sopapillia with every meal which were good.
