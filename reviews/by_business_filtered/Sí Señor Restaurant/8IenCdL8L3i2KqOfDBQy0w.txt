Went there last nigh,a tall Spanish waiter took our order.
I order tacos but wanted flour tortillas,he said no In a very rude manner.when i asked why he said are you going to place a order or not.we all looked at each other and said wow,my friend asked him to smile to break the ice.due to that experienced I would not be returning
