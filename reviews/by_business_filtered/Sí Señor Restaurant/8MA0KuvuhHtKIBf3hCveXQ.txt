Si Senor is pretty good. The best part of the meal is the chips and four different dips at the beginning and then the sopapillas at the end. The food is decent, I've had worse, but I've had better.

The service is always very friendly, it's usually pretty easy to get a table even on the weekends and it's inexpensive. Out of all the Mexican food joints I've tried in the area, this has been the best.
