mmmm New Mexico style mexican food in Arizona! We ordered a number of plates and shared to taste a combo of things:  The Chile con (green) Carne & The Chile Relleno were my favorite! Cheese Enchiladas and Chimichanga were just good. Our favorite was the chicken sopapillas (w red sauce) and shredded beef gorditas. You can't find authentic gorditas anywhere but Texas and NM, so what a treat! Si Senor is very generous in their complimentary chips w 4 different salsas when you arrive then sweet sopapillas for dessert. (They might charge for a 2nd order of chips though -not sure, never had to order more -ask your server). Only negative I can express would be that they didn't have the soap filled in the men's restroom (per my husband ;)
