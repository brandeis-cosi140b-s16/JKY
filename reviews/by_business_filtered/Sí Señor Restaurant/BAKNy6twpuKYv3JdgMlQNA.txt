Good, authentic New Mexican food.  (Don't confuse this with Mexican... they are NOT the same.)  Very reasonable prices.  Atmosphere a bit on the weak side (primary reason for not getting 5 stars).

Have been to this restaurant at least a dozen times.  Service is usually quite quick. and the servers are always quite nice and polite.   Plenty of variety on the menu.  Drinks are reasonable and good.  Sopapillias for desert every time.  :-)  When they bring the chips and varieties of salsa, be sure to try the bean dip... it is fantastic, as is the green chile salsa.

Solid place, a good stand-by resturant for when you are drawing a blank on where to go.
