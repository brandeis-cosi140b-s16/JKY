First off I am from Las Cruces, NM where the original Si Senor is located and the funny thing is, I'm not a fan of that location. I much prefer the location in Chandler. It might be because I haven't found another New Mexican restaurant yet that satisfies my need for enchiladas or gorditas in this area, although I haven't tried looking either. Si Senor pretty much does it for me. The portions are huge so beware. My usual order is the red cheese enchiladas, the chile isn't too hot and has good flavor. The ground beef and shredded beef tacos are excellent. Best part is the sopapillas at the end of the meal, either plain or dusted with cinnamon sugar.

One thing I miss is my usual 23 oz mug of Dos Equis that the LC location has. I could get a bottle but there's something about a giant frosty glass!
