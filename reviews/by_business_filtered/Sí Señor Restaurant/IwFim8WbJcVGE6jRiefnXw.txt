This is hands down the best New Mexican food in the valley!  As a New Mexican transplant, I was so excited to learn about this place.  They even have a picture of the Organ Mountains near Las Cruces - my college town- hanging in the lobby!  The thing anyone from New Mexico misses when they leave  is GREEN CHILE!  If you haven't tried it, I suggest a trip to Si Senor to give it a try- you'll be hooked!  It comes in the hot or mild variety and is so flavorful. I always order the big combo plate so I have left overs for the next day!
