Want more chips? $3.  Want more salsa?  $3 (they will give you another basket of chips with it to justify the price I guess).  Want to share your plate with someone? $3  Pepsi? $3  Want to substitute a flour tortilla for a corn tortilla on a taco?  That will cost you $.55 but, they won't substitute it...  They will put all of the ingredients on a plate and you will have to make your own taco!!  Yea, made NO sense to me either and angered me enough to spend most of dining time signing up for Yelp on my iPhone.
