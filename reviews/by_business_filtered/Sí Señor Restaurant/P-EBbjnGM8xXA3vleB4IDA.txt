I have been eating at Si Senor for about 10 years now.  I love the fact they use Hatch peppers.  Their sauces are also among the best, and they bring out 4 kinds of sauce (well, one is a hot bean dip) with chips when you sit down to eat.  I noticed they seem to have recently changed their chip recipe to make them more healthy - and I don't like their new chips nearly as much as the old, greasy, salty ones.  Also, their menu prices keep going up fairly often.  Best time to go is lunch and look for the tiny menu usually stuffed in with the tray that has honey, etc.  You can get a great lunch for about 7 dollars (10:30 to 2) and it includes tea or soft drink!  Ordering off the menu, with drink, will cost about double that.
