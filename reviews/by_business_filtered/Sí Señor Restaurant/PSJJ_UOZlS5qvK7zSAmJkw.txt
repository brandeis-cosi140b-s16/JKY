The chips a 4 kinds of salsa/dips are out if this world! As for tacos, unfortunately, the bean taco was average and the chicken taco was tasteless and NOTHING like the tacos at Si Se√±or in NM. But I will give them another try so I will go again to try the chiles as my fiance' enjoyed his and they seem to get good reviews.
