Has become my go-to Mexican food joint. The chips with the green sauce and the jalape√±o creme sauce. Then the halfy-halfy red/green chili chicken chiminy-Changa followed up promptly with a complimentary hot and fresh sopapilla cinnamon and sugar, or just straight up plain with honey. Damn. I'm going to go tomorrow.
