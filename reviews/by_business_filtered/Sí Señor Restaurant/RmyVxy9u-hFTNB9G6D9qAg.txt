This is one of my favorite Mexican food joints in town.  We've been going here for 4 to 5 years and each time have had a great meal.  The food is consistent and savory.  The atmosphere is somewhat basic but they have a great value for the food served.  

If you like a hotter than average salsa, the green Hatch chili salsa is awesome.  The sopapillas at the end of the meal are always a wonderful treat.
