NMSU alum, Abq resident for the past 17 years - recently moved here to the valley...   I am spoiled by the above average Mexican restaurants in "the 505/575"...  If I could only find one or two of those restaurants here in the Phoenix metro, I would be one happy hombre.  Guess what.?  Si Se√±or has two locations - Las Cruces and Chandler.!  Southern NM food - CHECK.!!

Food came out a bit on the salty side for me (chx stuffed sopas, red + green "Christmas" on top.. Beans and rice..). but was otherwise VERY tasty.  I informed our waitress to reign in the salter a bit - I don't think she understood me though.....

The Hatch green chile is on point.  I cannot emphasize that enough .!!!!   I'm stoked to have a little bit of home 15 minutes away, instead of 5 hours.  :)

Oh yeah - I could eat a bowl of the green chile salsa served with the chips.....  Loved it.!

Wife had the beef flautas, kiddos rocked their favorites - bean and cheese burritos...  Everyone was happy.  Good food, decent margaritas.   Now if only I could convince them to serve RO water instead of straight from the tap, I would say this place is one star shy of Yelp! perfection.  Actually - compared to some of the other "New Mexican" restaurants we've tried here, it should be six stars...but I digress...

Service was 15% gratuity territory- average.
