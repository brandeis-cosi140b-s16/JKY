This is an amazing New Mexican food restaurant. Very good chips and salsa. Great for groups. Always had really good service here. Friendly management. 

The cheese enchiladas are amazing. The best I have had. If you love spice this place is for you. If they tell you something is hot.... It really is. Tacos are really good. The quesidillas with green Chilis are to do for. The hatch green Chilis here can not be beat. 

Great food for a great price.  You have to check this place out you will not be disappointed.
