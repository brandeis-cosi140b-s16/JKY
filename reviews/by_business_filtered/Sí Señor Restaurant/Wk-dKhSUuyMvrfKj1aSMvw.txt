Best Mexican food in the valley!!!  They start you out with a great combination of chips and dips, 4 different kinds and all yum yum.  If you like it hot this is your place.  My favorite plate is Chicken Enchilada plate with Hatch New Mexican Chili.  The real deal.  Owner trucks the chili in from New Mexico.  Family business from New Mexico.  Best seating is in the center room under the sky and don't forget to have a Don Julio Margarita.  Save room for desert they serve you Sopapillas on the house at the end of your meal (AMAZING!) I've tasted many things on the menu, you can't go wrong.
