Never never liked Mexican food growing up, until my NM transplanted friend took me here.  No other joint has touched this place in my heart.

--Hatch green sauce, there is nothing like it...
--Chips and 4 dips and sauces, omg.
--Cheese enchilada plate (better than the chicken), chicken tacos or the flautas. omg x2.
--Sopapillas, omg omg omg.  It does not get better than this.

Any out of towner who wants to try (NM) Mexican food, I take them here!
