The first thing I have to mention about this place is the chips and dips they serve.  Wow!  I mean WOOOOWWW!!  They bring out hearty chips along with 4, count 'em 4, different dips: red salsa, green salsa, hot bean, and some sort of spicy sour cream dip.  When you go to another Mexican restaurant after eating at Si Senior's, you will be pretty disappointed that they only served you one or two choices of dip with your chips.  

I've been here more than a handful of 10 in a span of ten years.  Every single time, the food was excellent, the place is clean, the atmosphere is cool, and the service is good.

I usually order either the Chili Relleno Plate (green chiles) or the Green Chile Plate.  Both are well made with top notch ingredients.  They even get their chiles from Hatch Valley.  

To top it all off, after your main course, they serve you with a choice of regular or cinnamon sopapillas.  I usually have to give mine up, since my daughters just can't get enough of those.  

Their house-brewed flavored iced tea is very refreshing.  It's the perfect beverage to compliment the dishes they serve, other than margaritas.

As you have read from pretty much all of the reviews about Si Senior, you just can't miss trying the chips and dips.  All of those people just can't be wrong.
