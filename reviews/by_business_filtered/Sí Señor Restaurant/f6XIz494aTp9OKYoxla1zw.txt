Surely not a place I will be dying to go to again.

Server was friendly.. but terrible.  Took forever to get chips and salsa, took a long time for her to take our drink order, she charged me an extra buck for my beer, forgot to bring out my water, my girlfriends diet coke remained empty for most of the meal, and forgot my leftover box until being reminded a few times.  Wasn't that busy... maybe just an off night for her.

Really can't scratch off a place due to a miss on service.  So, onto the food.  So completely overpriced for just your standard Mexican fare.  I had the green chile con carne which was good, but around $9.00 bucks for a small bowl is so completely overpriced.  They give you one serving of chips and then want to charge $3.00 for your second serving.  We didn't finish through our first batch of chips but I still found it a bit tacky.  Couple that with the fact that they charge you $3.00 for plate splitting.  Everywhere you turn on the menu it's telling you, extra charge for this, extra for that, limited refills, no substitutions.  You'd almost get the impression they really don't want you there.  My girlfriend got an enchilada plate which she said was decent, but not fantastic (especially for the price).


I'm sure there are better options in the area to find.
