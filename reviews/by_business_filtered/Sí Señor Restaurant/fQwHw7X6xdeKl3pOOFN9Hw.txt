This place severs real deal Mexican food.  I've lived in Chandler for 30 years, and I tried this place for the first time today. I can only kick myself for not going sooner. I LOVE good green chili, and these guys do it right. The best part is you can get either pork of beef. I had the beef today for lunch and it was great! Can't wait to take our friends and family here. 

The chips are served with not one sauce, but 4. Sour cream, beans, as well as, red and green sauce. The dinners even comes with a free sopapilla, and who doesn't love a good warm sopapilla?
