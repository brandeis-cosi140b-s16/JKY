As always I'm not disappointed at all. Went here for lunch and had their lunch special for $7 which included the drink. I had the chili replenish which was actually two large ones along with beans and rice. Mom had the enchilada and taco. Both of us had the hot green chili sauce. Yummy. Of course we filled up on the chips and four types of sauces/dips first. Of course we saved room for the sopapillas. Melt in your mouth goodness topped with plenty of honey. We have enough to for two more meals. Not bad for less than $20.
