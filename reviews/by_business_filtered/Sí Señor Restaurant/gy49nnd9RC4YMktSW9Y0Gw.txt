I have to post my experience here. I used to come here for business and take out once in a while. I called on 3/22 and ordered #5 with chicken and double rice, no beans. I opened the box and it was cheese (no chicken) and beans.. I called and let them know. I was told that they would charge my card back $16.25.. 

It is now 4/17 and I have not seen my money back. I have also called and left 8 messages for the manager who is apparently never there, nor does she call people back.. 

I am a member of the Chandler Chamber of Commerce and now everyone there knows my experience. I'm extremely disappointed that I was just lied to and blown off after all the $$ I have spend there in the last 4 years. The food has really gone downhill and my husband never wanted to go because he says its just microwaved food that's marked up 10x.. Maybe this place will go out of business before they fix what's wrong
