I really enjoy this place. The food is good (not excellent) and they give you plenty of it. The prices are reasonable. Everything I have tried has been spicy but not to the point of discomfort. Mexican is my favorite so I am somewhat of a critic however, the warm sopapillas with honey are worth the trip alone. I will definitely return.
