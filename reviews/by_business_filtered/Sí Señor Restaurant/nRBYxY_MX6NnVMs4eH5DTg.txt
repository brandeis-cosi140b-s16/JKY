After eating at Si Senor on Alama School road in Chandler i was impressed with the quality of food and the flavor. Best Mexican food  in the east valley with a New Mexico touch to the spices . I ordered the Chicken enchiladas which came with rice and beans . I tried the red and green salsa on the enchiladas to compare and the green was new mexico style
yum yum    expect a short wait on weekends as their is always a lineup but worth the wait
