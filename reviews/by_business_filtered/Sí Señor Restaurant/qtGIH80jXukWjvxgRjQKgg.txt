I haven't found a Mexican restaurant that compares yet. 

Salsas are hot, so be sure you have your water before you indulge. My favorite is the hot green, but they offer 4 varieties of salsas. 

The shredded beef is good. The chicken is always good - all white meat! The ground beef is yummy too, but not my first choice. 

My favorites are the enchiladas, the taco salad and also the tacos. 

A weekly craving! And the best happy hour around, as it is daily from the late afternoon until 7pm.
