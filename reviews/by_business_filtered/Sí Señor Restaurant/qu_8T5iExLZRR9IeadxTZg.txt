Food was ok. If you are a fan of spice with no flavor. I went here with my family after reading the positive reviews. The best thing that I had was the Margarita, wife and kids enjoyed the chips and dips. The Decor of the place is very nice and the server was very attentive. Just wasn't my "cup of tea" when it comes to flavor of the food. I'm an AZ native so maybe it just a NM thing, but I didn't care for the same heat on every item I tried.

Would I return? Probably for just drinks and appetizers.
