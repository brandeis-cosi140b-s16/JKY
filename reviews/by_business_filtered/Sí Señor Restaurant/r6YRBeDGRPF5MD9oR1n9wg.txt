This was my number 1 choice for dinner. I loved it. I raved to clients and friends, took out of town friends there, went there for special occasions......And then went back today.... my favorite meal... my ONLY meal (because I loved it so so much) is gone from the menu.  The green chili plate with beef (most restaurants serve with pork) has now been switched to pork. Not a fan so unfortunately I left empty handed. I literally cried. My husband likes a lot of stuff there so I'm sure their other food is delicious but I won't be back. My search will have to resume again for an amazingly tender beef green chili plate.
