Yummy! This place is wonderful, beside great decorations and a beautiful mural of AZ when you walk in, the food is great. They give you chips and 4 kinds of dip to start. I ordered a traditional green cheese enchilada! It was huge and came with b&r. This place is a jem ! Reasonably priced abs very clean and friendly.5 starts.
