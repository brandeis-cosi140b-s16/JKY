For what Si Senor is, kind of a combination New Mexican/Mexican restaurant, it's good. Not great, but good. If you have a strong need for a Mexican food "fix", Si Senor should fit the bill. I am from Las Cruces originally, home of lots of really good New Mexican restaurants making use of that famous Hatch chile. Based on these other places - Si Senor is in the middle of the pack. Here, it's pretty good. Nice to have the 4 types of salsa offered with chips as soon as you sit down. Always good service. You usually don't have to wait long for the food to appear - indicative of having a good assembly line in the kitchen, with the food in various stages of preparation. Try the stuffed sopapillas for something a little different. Make sure to ask for extra salsa though since they really don't add too much chile to them. Of course, their enchiladas are standard solid fare! We go pretty often!
