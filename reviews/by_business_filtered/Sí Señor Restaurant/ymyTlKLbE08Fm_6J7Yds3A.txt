Fire new mexican food! All the sauces were seasoned perfectly and super flavorful. The Chile relleno was money. Slightly crispy on the outside. The sour creme has green chillies in it and it's ridiculous. Good size potuons, the rice was tasty and the beans were seasoned just right  the sopapilla was fluffy and airy. Service was good. Left happy. This is a gem.
