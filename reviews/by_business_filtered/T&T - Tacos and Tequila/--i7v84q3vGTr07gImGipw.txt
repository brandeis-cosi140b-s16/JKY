The food is delicious, very good service but the music was horrid! Distracting and just ewww.

I Ordered chicken tamales for the appetizer. They were so yummy. I would love some right about now! The sliced avacado garnishes added a delicious rich taste. 

My main dish was Chicken Sabana . The best part for me was no flour tortilla. It looked like a gigantic stuffed tortilla but the outter part of the dish was actually a very thinly sliced chicken breast used as a "tortilla". The inside stuffed with grilled veggies. Delicious and perfect for someone not looking for too much carbs. The side of rice was good but I was more into the main dish ... I ended up forgetting about the side of rice.

Oh and they offer every table fresh tortilla chips and freshly made salsa/sauces. Pretty cool.

Fresh tasting food. The decor is fresh, nice and cool. The music SUCKS! It like old uncool, never heard of rock. Yuck. So I give it 4 stars... not 5.
