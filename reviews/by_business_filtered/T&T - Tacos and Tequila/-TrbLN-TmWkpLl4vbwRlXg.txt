This was surprising super yummy.  Me and the b/f just checked into the luxor after an early morning flight and just wanted to grab something quick to eat before exploring the town and there were ads for this all over so we tried it out and it was actually really good.  The chips and salsa was super yummy and the tacos and burrito we got was really tasty.  I don't know what they do to the meat but it's good.

We only stayed in LV for 4 days and we ate here before we left also because we thought it was just that good we had to go again before leaving.
