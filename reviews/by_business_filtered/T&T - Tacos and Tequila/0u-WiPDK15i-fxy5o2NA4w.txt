Valentines 2/14/11

Originally have been here for a margarita before, but ended up finding a gold mine instead. The drinks were not good and over priced. Have not tried the food but would stick with Hussongs down the hall before trying the food here.

The one thing I do stop by this place for is their photo booth. $5 for 12 photos that instantly print out to keep. Great for a quick 5 minutes of fun with your group or date.
