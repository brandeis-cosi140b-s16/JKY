Me and my sister stayed at the luxor and decided to go in and eat. oh em gee was the food horrible!!! Never again will I ever go back.  I had the half torta with soup the meat was too mushy and the soup tasted like tomato soup with tortilla chips disgusting!  My sister felt sick after eating there. It doesn't taste like mexican food at all.. never again.. do not go there if I could I would leave no stars but I have to leave one
