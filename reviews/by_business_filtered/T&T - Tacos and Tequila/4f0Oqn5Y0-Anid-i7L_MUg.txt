Just like any Mexican food place, free chips and salsa are included. The chips are by far the best I've had. 
Be prepared to open up your wallet here and still be hungry. You will pay $15 for three tacos, which are not average size tacos, there small tacos that fit in your hand. You pay for the experience and convenience here, not the food. We paid $50 for 2 taco plates, 1 Negro modelo, and 1 mixed margarita. Not a bargain.
The food taste great though, so it's ultimately up to you.
