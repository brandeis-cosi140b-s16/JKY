It really deserves a 3.5 but not quite sure it is a 4 out of 5. The salsas were not my favorite but the chips were really good. They have some good happy hour choices  in appetizers and drinks. However, the sangria was not very good. 

The barbacoa tacos which used lamb were really tasty! This was not something I have had in the past (lamb barbacoa). It could have been shredded a bit more but it was good. And there was tons of it. You could definitely share a plate with someone if you have some chips and salsa ahead of time. The shrimp tacos al pastor were also  very good and provided tons of food! The salad/pico de gallo side which you can get instead of rice or beans is decent also. 

Would I come back? Maybe. It was decent for sure. It is just a bit dark in the restaurant and not in a fun, trendy or romantic sort of way. It just seems a bit depressing. 

The service was also decent.
