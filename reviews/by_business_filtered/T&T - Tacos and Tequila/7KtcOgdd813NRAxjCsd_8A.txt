Food: 4/5
Ambiance: 3/5
Service: 1/5

This was our first visit and our last. The food was just okay especially considering the price and better options in Vegas. The ambiance was good but they were blasting 60/70s American rock, not very Latin inspired. The service was atrocious. Our server, Angel was just horrible. I normally am very understanding & forgiving when it comes to food service but I saw no excuse for our lousy service. The restaurant had light traffic and there seem to have adequate staff for the night.
