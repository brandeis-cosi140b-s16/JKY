The food isn't bad, but it's a little expensive. My girlfriend and I ate here for lunch and it came out to about $60 total. For that price, we should've just went to a good buffet. The food is on par with a regular tex-mex restaurant. The sangria here is pretty good though. I will not be returning to eat here.
