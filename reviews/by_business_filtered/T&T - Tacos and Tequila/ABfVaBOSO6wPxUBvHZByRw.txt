very nice mexican food, perhaps smaller then i like portions, but very tasty, beautiful plated and felt very authentic

over paid for our sangria pitcher at $25 that felt very much water down and  didnt have the proper kick

i had a combo plate to try 3 different things, taco, enchilada and corn rap thing i forget its name. all were very tasty.
my wife had chicken faitas that was ok (we get a much better one at home to be honest). both dishes came with rice, black beans.
they also give you some fry tortillas and two home made salsa sauces that are to die for.....one a little hot and the other very burned char flavor....

all in all a  very nice dinner, wrong choice of alcohol (beers was probably the way to go here) and a bill that come up to $75 after tax and tip.....
