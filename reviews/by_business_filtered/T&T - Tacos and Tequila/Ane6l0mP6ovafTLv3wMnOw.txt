My boss loves to take us here...
Because it's one of the few reasonably priced places in Vegas.

It's OKAY.

They usually sit you towards the back and blast those TERRIBLE Vegas mash up songs.

Service takes a minute at the tables, but it's pretty good.

So come here if you don't want to spend a crap ton of dough.

Grab a giant margarita from the bar across the way, have some tacos, some chips, and dip.

Because it's Vegas, don't want to spend too much time doing silly things like eating, or being in a hotel room.
