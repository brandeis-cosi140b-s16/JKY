I ordered the lunch special. 1/2 chicken Torta and 1/2 a Cobb salad. The Torta was pretty good. The salad had way too much dressing. After the first bite I was done. So if you get a salad I suggest asking for dressing on the side if you don't want your salad swimming in dressing. The service was pretty good.
