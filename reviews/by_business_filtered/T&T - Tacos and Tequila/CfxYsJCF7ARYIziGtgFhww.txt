A group of people from my job were in Las Vegas for the Interop convention, and most of us stayed in the Luxor. Our first night in, we decided to keep dinner close and easy, so one of our managers picked T&T.

As with all things Las Vegas, it's overpriced and oversexed. If that's too much for you, best not to come into LV at all.

On the plus side, the food was pretty decent. Service was good, although the food took longer than it should have to come out since it was not busy when we were there. There were ample chips and salsa provided, and the waitress was very on top of keeping drinks refilled.

So why 3 stars, and not 4? In all honesty, part of that score stems from the fact that it's the Luxor, a hotel I will never stay at again after this trip. The rest is based on price (yes, it's Vegas, no, that doesn't make it acceptable) and the wait time on the food.  

Good service and good food make it a good, not great, place to go if you're nearby.
