We just arrived and were hungry and what a disgusting lunch. Combo taco the chicken was so so but the beef was very horrible and the pork was inedible. The rice was tasteless, chewy and I think it was plastic. The black beans were refried but I'm thinking canned and refried at least 10 times over to look like dog food. In summary I think mc Donald's would have done a better job with a mc taco and I didn't have to spend $69.00 plus tip! Don't go here!
