Thanks to Restaurant.com for saving me 25 dollars here. I went here last night before the yelp twofer event with my boyfriend and parents. We got seated right away and looked over the menu with no help from the waiter. My parents shared the combo tacos, boyfriend had the chicken tacos, and i had veggie tacos. Our waiter took our order and gave us some water. We maybe waited for 15 minutes for our food and 5 minutes before it came out we got chips and salsa. Both the red and green salsa were not spicy whatsoever and I was disappointed that it took them so long to bring out that free little batch of them. Our order came and all four of us agreed all of our tacos were pretty bland. The rice and black beans were nothing to write home about. Out of the combo, chicken, and veggie tacos I can say that mine (veggie) had the most flavor and that isn't saying a lot considering they were mostly onions with a piece of zucchini in each. sad, sad taco makes for a sad, sad chastine. the prices were awfully overpriced for this food and the service was just lazy. I believe our waiter only came by once to fill our water and not even ask how our food was. He didn't even offer us a dessert menu and just charged us right as the plates were being taken away (and added on his own tip.)  Now i get that we had a certificate for 25 dollars but that is no excuse to be lousy with us. We are paying customers (and reviewing ones for that matter!) I have no idea how they have some good reviews. I know my family and I will not be returning.
