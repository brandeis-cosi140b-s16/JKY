As soon as I check into Luxor I run to get my favorite margarita their razzarita. T&T is great for a quick bite or to start your Vegas trip right with a bucket sized margarita. 
Their guacamole is nothing special but their chicken enchiladas have helped me start my day after a long night of exploring Vegas.
