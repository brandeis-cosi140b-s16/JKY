Like most other people, we had never heard of this place before but saw all the signs for it while we were checking in so we figured we would give it a try.   The weren't a lot of people in there, so it was kind of surprising that the service was slow.

Just like everything else in Vegas, of course its overpriced.  Yeah, not too cool paying $14 for three mini tacos.  You would think that with their name being "Tacos N Tequila" that they'd have some great specials for their Tequila drinks...Nope.  $12 for the same weak margarita you get everywhere else in Vegas.   I'll give them some props on the red and green salsa though, it was delicious.  Also  whatever they season the meat with makes it very good.   So they do get props on the food, the portions are just too small.

Also, right across from the restaurant they have one of those slushie bars where you can get alcohol slushies from.  Don't even waste your time here, because they are super-weak.   For stronger drinks, start walking towards the shops that connect the Luxor with Mandalay Bay and you'll see another slushie bar called Fat Tuesdays.  The slushies here are cheaper AND stronger.
