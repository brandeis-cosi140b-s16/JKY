So...T and T does have some pretty good and unusual food--I had some pounded chicken breast/chili thing that was tasty and filling.  They also have some very unusual and fun tacos that I have not seen anywhere else, so kudos for that.  On the minus side, it is smokey/smelly from sitting in the belly of the Luxor, it is loud, and it always seems to be a long wait to sit down.  The prices are fair, so it is a better choice than many of the other venues nearby.
