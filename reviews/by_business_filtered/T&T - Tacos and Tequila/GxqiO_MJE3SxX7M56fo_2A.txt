Went here before a show with my family, and the food was just alright.

The atmosphere was very loud, but the music was kind of neat. All of the songs were mashups of two different songs combined, which was a lot of fun for a music lover like me. 

The drinks were good. I had a peach one and my mom had a watermelon one and both were very tasty. The chipotle salsa thing was awesome. It made the chips taste like a BBQ chip, but my salad was a little bit overkill. 

The ceasar salad was VERY garlic-y. I love pretty much anything garlic, but this was almost spicy it was so garlic-y. Luckily for me I was just with family and not on a date, and had some mint gum with me, but unless you are garlic obsessed, don't order the ceasar. The menu was pretty limited, and didn't really have anything I would have normally ordered from a Mexican restaurant, but if you're just going there to drink, you've come to the right place.
