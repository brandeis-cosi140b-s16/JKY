We were at the Luxor this weekend and the first thing I would see when we stepped out of our room was T&T so we decided to go there. It was excellent. The chips and salsa were awesome. I ordered a combo with a chicken enchilada, a chile relleno, and a barbacoa taco and my husband ordered the carnitas plate. There didn't seem to be much food on the plates like we are used to seeing but everything was delicious and it was actually plenty of food. My taco was to die for and he said it was some of the best carnitas he has had. My only complaint is it is pricey, but that's Vegas for you.
