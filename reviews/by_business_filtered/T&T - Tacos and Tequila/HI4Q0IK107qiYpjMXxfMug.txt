Went here yesterday for lunch, it was quiet so expected good speedy service..
Nope!! sat for 15 mins before we got our order in, 2 drinks and a chicken enchilada appetizer to share.

Food was bland, drinks were okay but expensive.  $50 for a drink and an appetizer?  go elsewhere, this place is terribly expensive, bad service and not worth the price
