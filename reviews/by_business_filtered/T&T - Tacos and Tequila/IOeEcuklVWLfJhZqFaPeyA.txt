Who woulda ever thought.............. vegetarian tacos can be so GoooooD!

Im not vegetarian, but i love veggies. Besides my dish, the salsas and other dishes were great too! one of my girlfriends cant stand mexican food, but actually enjoyed the fish tostadas, another favorites of mine.

I also bought a t-shirt from their little shop nearby, it was pretty soft. Thats a plus!
