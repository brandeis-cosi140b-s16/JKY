Hubby and I came here with friends. We had been exploring Luxor with them and wanted food so T&T was suggested.

There is a great amount of options on the menu and we had difficulty in deciding just what to eat. It seems though that whatever you order is great as we all loved the food. The food was a solid 5 stars!

HOWEVER, the service. 2 stars. I had asked about the virgin margaritas, the waiter was snarky as he had supposedly read them out to someone else on the table. Had I heard him I wouldnt have asked. If hubby and I had been here alone then we would have told him to forget it and gone elsewhere seeing as his attitude was terrible. It seemed he just didnt want to be there at all. Not great for the restaurant at all.

If the service had been good then I think I would have been in a better position to give a great review opposed to just an ok.
