This place is okay. You can find the same kind of tacos (better and cheaper) off the strip. Their margaritas came in the same cup as the water cup. I figured with a cool place called tacos and tequila, that it would come in a nice salted typical margarita glass. 
I guess if you are staying at Luxor and want tacos and tequila, then go here.
