We had a gift certificate for T&T so my husband and I tried it out for dinner. The first thing we noticed when we walked in is there where no booths, only tables. So we had to sit at a table putting the lady next to me closer to me than my husband, making conversations very hard. The food was awesome, except for the salsa. The salsa was very boring. The chips were very good though. Our waiter was not the best and it took forever to get our credit card back after we paid. BUT THE FOOD WAS VERY GOOD. This place is worth a shot if you haven't had it before. But we definitely wouldn't make it our go to place.
