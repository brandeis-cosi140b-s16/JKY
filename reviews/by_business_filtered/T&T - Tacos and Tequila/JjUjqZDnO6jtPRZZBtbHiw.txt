We started my birthday celebration at T&T. The waitress was great. I ordered the shredded chicken tacos and my husband ordered the pulled pork tacos. We both enjoyed our dinners. The music was pretty awful. The price to portion ratio is a little out of sync. I liked the open atmosphere. The best drink of the night ... the spicy lover.
