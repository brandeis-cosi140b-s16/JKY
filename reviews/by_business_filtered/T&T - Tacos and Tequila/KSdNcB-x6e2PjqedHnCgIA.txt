The best SALSA and chips ever: PRICELESS

Since we had a pyramid room right above T&T  we wanted to check this restaurant out so when we saw it featured on the bar crawl we were stoked.

We finally made it over here around 10PM as part Luxor Halloween bar crawl.  The place was packed, service was a little slow, but friendly (acceptable given the circumstances), and the food was phenomenal.  

The salsa was so good that my bf asked if they bottled it because he wanted to take a bunch home.

Thank you T&T for filling up our tummies and being a part of an awesome drunken Halloween night.
