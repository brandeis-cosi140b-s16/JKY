YUCK! 

 We went here for sunday brunch, expecting something substantial to satisfy our hangovers, and a nice cold bloody mary. Instead we got overpriced child sized portions of average mexican food, the most disgusting bloody maria I have ever had in my life(it was sweet and tasted like ketchup-barf!), and RUDE service from the waiter. He brought us all yet another round of the vomit-inducing bloody marias  (they were 2 for $10) and refused to make a substitution. When I politely explained that none of us liked the bloody marias as they were too sweet, he ARGUED with me in broken english and then finally bought us a round of margaritas when we were done with our two bite meals. By the way, the margaritas are gross too. Oh, and as you walk in the door you are greeted by some guy who tries to get your information for their email list and there was some chick on a microphone yakking away the whole time about drink specials, trying to drum up business. This place is a ripoff and with so many other fantastic restaurants in vegas you would be much better off somewhere else....I'd even rather eat at the circus circus buffet. And that's bad...but at least I would not leave feeling violated.
