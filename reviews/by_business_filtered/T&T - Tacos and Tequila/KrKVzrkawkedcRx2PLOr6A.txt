This have HH specials that include half price appetizers (except ceviche and app platter), and $5 drinks specials; beer and sangria.

We decided to eat here because of the HH specials. Nothing on the regular menu jumped out at me, but I do like half price, so.....this is where we ate!

They give you one complimentary basket of chips and tomatillo and salsa. The tomatillo was good, especially when you squeeze fresh lime on it.

We started with the fundido (chorizo on the side) and that was good. It comes with 3 warm flour tortilla wraps to dip in the cheese. (We needed another 3 since it wasn't enough).
We also had some guacamole. Both were good. I'd probably order both again if I came here. The sangria was good too. I prefer Firefly's red sparkling sangria over theirs, but it was still good. Nothing else on the menu really grabbed me. 

Service was OK. We sat at the bar (so we could get the HH specials). I'd come back here but only for the HH. But, I also like strip bars HH in Mandalay Bay, so I'd probably choose them over this place. But if you like HH deals, this one is pretty decent.
