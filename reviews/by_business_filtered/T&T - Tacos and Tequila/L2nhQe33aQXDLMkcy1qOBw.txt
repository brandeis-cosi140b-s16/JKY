Ate here with my daughter and some friends that were visiting from Memphis. We had the Queso Fundido which was good...my friends had never had it before but liked it. Two ordered Chicken Fajitas and loved them, One ordered the 3 enchilada combo (cheese, chicken, and beef) and he really like it (and he's kind of a picky eater) and I ordered the Combo Fajitas...the chicken and shrimp were awesome. I wasn't fond of the steak because it had a lot of fat on it. 3 of us had sodas, and 1 had 2 beers. It was good and I'd go again, but it is kind of expensive. The bill was around $125 or so. The waiter and staff were great (with the exception of the hostess) - she seemed rather bored and disinterested and looked like she had just rolled out of bed and headed to work.
