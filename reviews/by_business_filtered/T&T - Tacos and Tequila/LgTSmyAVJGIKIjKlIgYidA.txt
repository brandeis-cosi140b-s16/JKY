Last month we stayed at the Luxor hotel for my birthday. Being that T&T was close by and we didn't feel like walking super far away for lunch, we decided to eat here. WORST DECISION EVER!! The food was mediocre, but it was the service that we received that was literally the worst I have ever experienced! The waiter seemed to be having a bad day. I asked him twice if he could bring me some limes for my tacos, eventually I had to go to the bar to get them myself from a bartender. 2 of our friends came and joined us about 5 mins after we ordered, and they bring us the check for everyone before we even recieved our food, what kind of restaurant does that? So we complained to the manager, he comes and says he's going to take care of everything, instead he brings us all a round of tequila shots that we never asked for and don't want as if that makes everything better! We just wanted to leave we were waiting for about 45 mins and weren't even busy! We wont be back!
