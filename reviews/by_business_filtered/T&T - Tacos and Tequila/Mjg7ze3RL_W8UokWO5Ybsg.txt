There were limited options for dinner before the show we were seeing at the Luxor. The 20 year old ticket agent suggested T&T. Said it was great. I should have known we would not have the same palate. We started our meal with a set of mojitos. Our waiter indicated they were very good. I order them whenever I can so I have had my share of mojitos. These were very very sweet. I ordered club soda twice to add to our drinks to reduce the sweetness. Nothing saved these drinks. We didn't even finish half of it. Horrible.
The chips and salsa were also not very good which is fairly unusual. Pretty easy to make good chips and salsa. I had tacos for dinner and my friend had a shrimp dish. Both were very average.
Our server was friendly and even came around at the end and offered free tickets to the show. We already had purchased our tickets but the offer was very kind.
I wouldn't go back to this restaurant because if I had known the Asian restaurant had a good menu I would have gone there.
