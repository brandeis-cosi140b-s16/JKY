Came here for the first time over the weekend to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Prices are expensive for Mexican food, but again this is the strip.  I'm sure there are some better places off the strip but you're here for the atmosphere more than anything.  The foods was surprisingly good.  The tried the Chile Relleno combo and it was very good.  Also ordered the Bloody Maria which is their Tequilla version of a Blood Mary and it cleared out the sinuses.  Which when you combine that with some good chips and salsa and it's the perfect way to start out a night!  Add in the fact they had the Lakers game on the screen and the night was pretty good!
