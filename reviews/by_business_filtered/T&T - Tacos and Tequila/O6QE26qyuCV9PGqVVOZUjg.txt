The good:  Salsa, salsa,salsa. Mariachi band on Sunday brunch day. Tequila.

The bad: Whoa that food is pricey. small portions. 


Live Mariachi band rocks. Ever heard "Gasolina" by Daddy Yankee in Mariachi? Well look no further because these guys break it down.  hello. best salsa ever. I literally was like "no i dont want to go here cause it's expensive as shit." but damn that salsa made all my worries go away. The green, not the red. 
I got the machaha burrito or something like that, it was okay. The carne asada was really good. The carnitas was pretty tasty (i'm also not one for meat so it had to be pretty damn good) The portions are small and very expensive but that salsa i mean. Ya. Loved it. 

 The salsa. i will go back just for that special delish!
