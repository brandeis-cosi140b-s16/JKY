I got a burrito with rice and beans. They all tasted ok (just ok), but the temperature was lukewarm. The chips were terrible. They tasted like old, burnt grease. We inquired with our waiter about the T&T souvenir glass drinks, but apparently they don't sell them in the restaurant. You have to go out to purchase them at a nearby drink stand. Portions were decent, but you would kind of expect more from the price tag.
