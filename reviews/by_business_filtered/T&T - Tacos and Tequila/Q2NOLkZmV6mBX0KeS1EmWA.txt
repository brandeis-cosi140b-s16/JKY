This is actually now my third time coming here. Its a good solid for me.  Meaning my appetite will be satisfied and I feel I got my moneys worth in comparison to what I have gambled on.  It is a restaurant with table service.  They give you real guac.  Not green goo they call Guac.  The chips are probably one of the best I have had.  Salsa is not the best I have had but pretty good.  They are a little more fresh mex vs. authentic.  Avg price is $18 per entree so expect $60 avg for two after all is said and done.  My only complaint is wait service was bad this time and last time was just so so.  Our waitress never came to refill our drinks until we were eating our last few bites.  She also did not seem too enthused about working there at all.  My pics didn't come out well because it is horribly dark in there.  It is somewhat nice for the ambience but I think a candle at the table would add just a little more light while still keeping the mood.
