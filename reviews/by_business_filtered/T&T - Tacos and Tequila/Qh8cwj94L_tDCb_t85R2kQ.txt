Meh indeed. After a long flight and checking into the Luxor, we ate at Tacos and Tequila for convenience. The wait staff wasn't really incredibly friendly, the "ambiance" as stated in another review as the positive, was generic, and the food was generic and overpriced. I know to expect that to an extent on the Strip, but really-- it could have been better for the money. The food was not terrible by any means, but we both left feeling like overall the experience was not worth it.
