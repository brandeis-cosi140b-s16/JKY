So, I am a big foodie, love trying new places and i believe first time here, it was an ok experience,  drinks were mediocre. The guacamole was good, but they don't serve you enough to eat with your taquito order but they will charge you 3 dollars to get more than what originally comes with your order... lol Service was flat and she messed up on the food order. Never took the time to make sure what we ordered was indeed what we received. Of course, it was brought our server, Alicia's attentiopn, but by that time it was too late, you should pay more attention to your customers... defeats the purpose and it totally messes up your tip, doubt that I'd be willing to spend money in here again or recommend it, to anyone else, so your 12 tip minus 3 for the guacamole and another 7 for the incorrect food order... leaves you with 2 bucks, one for each star I gave and I was being nice
