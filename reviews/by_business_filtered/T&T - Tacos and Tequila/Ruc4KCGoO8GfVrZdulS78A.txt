This place deserves ZERO stars! The food is worse than AWEFUL and the staff act like you are bothering them if you ask a question. How dare I ask to substitute chicken for beef?!? 
We were the only ones in the restaurant, but the girl put us in the walkway. The bar patrons ran into us each time the made a restroom run. I finally had to sit my chair sideways to the table to avoid an elbow to the head.
We ordered the same combo available at most chain Mexican restaurants, but it was twice the price here. It included a street taco (come on guys, even a street vendor can afford to use two tortillas!), an enchilada made with the same mini sized tortilla (but one bite of the unmelted cheese was enough to know it sucked), and a chili relleno stuffed with corn instead of cheese (got a better price for the corn than some cheese, huh?)
My mom finally managed to flag someone down to ask if she could get something less spicy. "No", was the reply. I asked for the manager and was given the bill instead. 
Vegas may be known for gambling, but I didn't think that included lunch too!
