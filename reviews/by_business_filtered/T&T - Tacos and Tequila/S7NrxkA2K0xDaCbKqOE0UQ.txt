We went for the six tacos and six small beer special. We also ordered guacamole - which was made extra spicy for us. Great guac! When our beers arrived we were told they ran out of "small beers" and gave us four large instead - that worked! When the tacos arrived we liked the carnitas the most and the chicken the least (a bit dry). The salsa was pretty good and complimented the guac big time. I liked that they gave us another basket of chips. I would give them four stars except the music was really awful: mash ups of classic rock songs with God-awful hip hop beats. BLASPHEMY!!!
