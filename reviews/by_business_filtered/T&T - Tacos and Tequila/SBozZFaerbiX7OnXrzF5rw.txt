You know...no, it's definitely not cheap.  

So I told myself "but Vegas."  

Got the Alambre tacos...cuz Vegas.

Oh my GOD were they good.  REALLY, really liked them.  The wife's fajita was also FANTASTIC.  I can't remember ever seeing fajita steak come out a perfect medium anywhere before like it did here.  VERY, very, very good salsa and chips, too.

All in all, highly recommended.  Pony up the dough...cuz Vegas.
