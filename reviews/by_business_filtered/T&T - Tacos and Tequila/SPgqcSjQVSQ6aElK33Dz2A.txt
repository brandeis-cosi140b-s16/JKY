I ate here yesterday while I was staying at the Luxor for a few days during an impromptu Vegas getaway. The place seems pretty cool, and I always hear the commercials for T&T at Morongo, so when I saw the Luxor had one, I knew I had to try it.

I arrived during Happy Hour (11am-6pm), and noticed they had frozen margaritas (lime) on the list, but not regular margaritas. Regular margaritas start at $12, but the happy hour frozen margaritas were only $5. It didn't take too long to convince myself I had to try one. I don't know if it was the empty stomach, or the coldness of the margarita, but I had a combination of alcohol-buzz and brain-freeze at the same time. Talk about being hit pretty hard!!

For food, I had the Fiesta Nachos and the Flautas, both $5. They were both small portions - the Nachos came in small bowl, and the Flautas on a small plate, and there were 4 of them. Both dishes were tasty, although they appeared to be rather skimpy with the toppings on the nachos, so there were many chips which were dry and plain.

I had two margaritas, plus the nachos and flautas, which came to $20 plus tax and tip - not too bad. 

If you like tequila, they have a HUGE selection of tequila to choose from! I'm not a big tequila fan, outside the occasional margarita, however if I were, this would be the place to go!!

Service was friendly - I sat at the bar, and my bartender was really nice and chatty.

Great times - and the next time I am in Vegas, I will probably stop by again.
