I wasn't very impressed with this place.  Don't get me wrong, the margaritas were great...it was everything else that wasn't worth it.  My husband and I went for dinner.  We were seated immediately, but the waitress took forever to greet us and get us our waters.  My husbands water was constantly empty and the waitress was no where in sight.  The food was okay, but the portions are very small.  Not at all worth the money.  Loved the decor in the restaraunt and the tequila selection, but everything else was a let down.
