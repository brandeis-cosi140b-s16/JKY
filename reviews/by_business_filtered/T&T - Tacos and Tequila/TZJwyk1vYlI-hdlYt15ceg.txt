Ok, confession! So I only tried this place because it because it is me and my sisters intials...is that wrong?? (T n T) Sure some of my tipsy decisions are a bit off but I was dead on here so don't judge!

T&T's was really, really tasty. It was a fun upbeat place to eat and everyone enjoyed their meals. They have a ton of different margaritas and all of them where great (ok the 3 I had where for sure)! The food prices where reasonable and on the weekends they have a dj!

Check this place out if you want a bomb (TnT) meal!
