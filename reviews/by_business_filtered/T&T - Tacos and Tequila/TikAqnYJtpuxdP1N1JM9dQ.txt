I walked past this restaurant multiple times thinking it looked very interesting before we decided to stop in for an afternoon snack.  The staff was very friendly and it's in a great location to hang out within the hotel.

We got an order of taquitos and the shrimp ceviche after hanging out at the pool all day which was exactly what we needed.  The food is definitely better than ordinary mexican and well worth stopping by at some point during your stay.

If we come back to this hotel, I would definitely stop by T&T to eat again.
