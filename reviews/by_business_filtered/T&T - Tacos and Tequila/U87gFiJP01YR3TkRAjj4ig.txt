Not sure why you would charge $12 for nachos that were something I could have made at home. $12 Margaritas and $10 Beers; total Vegas touristy thing to try. Bartender and Hostess had personalities of a WET MOP! Why should I stay and pay $12 for a drink when I can go too one of there bars and pay half the price and get better service. I will not come here again!
