What a pleasant surprise. we went for lunch to T & T because we purchased a gift certificate from restaurant.com. When we arrived we were seated promptly near a perfect people watching area. Restaurant is located on second level of luxor overlooking registration and the elevators so we could see everyone coming up and down. My husband wanted a drink from across the restaurant at the fat tuesday like station and our waitor went over and got us the drink. Our waitor not only made great suggestions he got my husband a stronger salsa made with habaneros which he enjoyed. We started with the chicken tostadas as an appetizer and then shared the chicken tamales, beef barbacoa enchiladas and the shaved tacos. the green salsa with chips was excellent. Food came quickly and they were constantly refilling our water. 
The restaurant is very trendy and has good music playing. We had a wonderful experience and plan to return on our next trip to Vegas.
