Here's my quick review.  The food was decent and the free chips were standout - very thick and fresh.  In fact we had the nachos and those were good too.  But, the service was terrible.  It really was not that busy and we rarely saw our waitress.  When we did, she seemed to have her mind on other things and was very inattentive.  I probably would not eat here again as a result but you shouldn't let that stop you if you are forced to eat here by virtue of say, staying at the Luxor.
