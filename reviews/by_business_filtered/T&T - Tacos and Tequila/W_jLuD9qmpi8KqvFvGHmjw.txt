Food and service is very mediocre. I ordered the carnitas tacos, everything was so dry ( meat, beans and rice). I also felt horrible after eating at this place... a further sign of terrible ingredients. 

Like many other places in Vegas, they are always quick to take your order, but when you actually need the server to pay ... They are no where to be found. We had to ask the bartender 2 times to send our server over do we could get the bill and pay.

Just another example of terrible overpriced food in Vegas.
