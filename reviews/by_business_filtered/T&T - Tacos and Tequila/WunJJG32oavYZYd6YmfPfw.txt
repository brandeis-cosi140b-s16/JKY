Shocked how good t and t is. It's the perfect hybrid of a San Diego / San Francisco taqueria, and a 4 star fine dining Mexican restaurant.

The chips are freshly deep fries tortillas, the salsas are flavorful and fresh, and the drinks are top notch.

The entrees shine. We got the #1 tacos in Vegas and they blew away our picky standards. (Were from sf and gf is Latin.) the bacon does indeed at a bit too much intensity, but it's thick cut and basically just adds the salt component. The carne is rich with the cheese and onions. 

So freaking good. Vegas food is blowing me away.
