To be honest I was a little worried about eating here after I read some of the mixed reviews. 
I ended up getting a Groupon for the Chonga margaritas and we ended up deciding to eat dinner here also. 
The margaritas were huge and delicious. We both got the regular frozen margarita with 2 mini Sol beers dumped into it. 
My husband ordered the Carne Asada which was juicy and flavorful. Since I wasn't too hungry I ordered the shrimp quesadilla off the appetizer menu. The quesadilla was definitely big enough for a meal. It was packed with shrimp, black beans and cheese. The chipotle aioli brought the flavors together and the flour tortilla was nice and crispy, just the way I like it. 
We both also liked the salsas that came with the chips, one was a green tomatillo type sauce and the other was a red chipotle salsa. Both were very tasty. I am now officially a fan of this place and will consider going back next time we are in Vegas.
