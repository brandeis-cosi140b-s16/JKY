Decent place for tacos and tequila (as the name would suggest) ... they were able to accommodate our large party (17 people) easily, and the service was good. The food is ok - fish and al pastor tacos were my favorite ... but the ambiance is nice too (not too loud, etc.). Prices are reasonable, margaritas are good too (but you can't get them blended - all on the rocks here peeps). 

Oh ... and they have tequila flights - FUN!
