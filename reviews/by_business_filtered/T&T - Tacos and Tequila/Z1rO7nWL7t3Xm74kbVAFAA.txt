We had just checked into Luxor when we realized how hungry we were. The front desk had given us a coupon for this place (which we proceeded to leave in the room) so we decided to give it a try. The restaurant did not look very busy, but since we had a group of 8 they told us it would take a while for them to put some tables together for us. The hostesses had seated everyone at every other table for four. While it made the restaurant look busier, it meant that there weren't any two tables for four next to each other. They ended up seating us in a closed section of the restaurant. We were the only ones there.

Our waitress came soon. She was very friendly. She told us about all her favorite places to go in Vegas. We just really wanted her to take and put in our order. They really scrutinized out driver's licenses when we ordered beers. She said she had to show mine to her manager since the picture didn't look right to her, but after she saw that everyone else at the table was about the same ages as me, she figured  it was legit and gave it back without showing anyone. We all went with tacos since the place is called Tacos and Tequila. 

We were brought our drinks and chips quickly, but the entrees took awhile. The serving sizes were pretty disappointing for the price. I paid $18 for 3 small tacos that were about two bites eat. That being said, they were the best tacos I have ever tasted. Previous to them, the best tacos I had ever eaten were at a place in Rosarito, Mexico. If they would either up their serving size or lower prices, I would come back. However, as good as the tacos were, they were not worth $18. I know some have called this place Hooters with a Mexican theme, but I could eat pretty well for $18 at Hooters (FYI, there's a Hooters across the street with 25 cent wings during late night hours in their 24 hour cafe, but read my review before heading over there).
