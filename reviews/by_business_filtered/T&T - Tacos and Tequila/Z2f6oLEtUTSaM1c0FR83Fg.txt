We choose this restaurant because we had a coupon for $25 off from restaurant.com.  T &T was cool because you get to just look up at the Luxor, which is both very strange and awe-inspiring at the same time.  Our margaritas were good, but pricey ($12; again, I know these are Vegas prices).  My pineapple margarita was delicious and I wish I knew of a place in Mass to get one. 

Everyone gets complimentary chips and salsa before their meal.  Both of the salsas were unique and spicy, but I preferred the hot salsa to the green, milder sauce.  After having beef barbacoa at New Mexican restaurant in Scottsdale, I knew I had to try it again and ordered the beef barbacoa enchiladas, which were all that I hoped for.  The husband ordered a combo plate, which he enjoyed.

The service was a little slow, but the food portions and deliciousness made up for it.
