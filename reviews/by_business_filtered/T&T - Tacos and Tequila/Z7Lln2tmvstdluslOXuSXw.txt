Nice spot overlooking the hotel, good variety of music playing but the food & service could be better. My girlfriend ordered guacamole but it didn't come with chips? They charged us for a second bowl of chips.. My chicken tacos were boring and dry and so were my friend's fajitas. Service was way too slow, and the restaurant wasn't even half full.
