Went here with my boyfriend to start off my 21st birthday celebration in Vegas. We were staying at the Luxor, and they did give us a coupon but we didn't see it until later that night.

Our server was incredibly nice, and extremely attentive. We were served warm chips and salsa. Both of the salsas were kind of weak, but maybe I'm used to salsa with more of a kick? We ordered guacamole for the chips and that was really good. 

I had the chicken tacos, which were very yummy - reminded me of the kind of tacos you can get for really cheap in LA. The boyfriend got chicken fajitas, and the chicken for that was even better than the chicken used for my tacos. 

For drinks, I had the watermelon cooler, which was nice - could hardly taste the alcohol. My boyfriend ordered the Pineapple Chipotle, which was okay but not as good as expected. He then had the Choke on Smoke, which, when they warn you that you can expect to grow chest hairs from it, they are NOT kidding. It was extremely strong, and definitely helped the boyfriend get from buzzed to full on drunk. 

Over all, it was pretty good food for being a Mexican restaurant in a Las Vegas hotel. Yes, it's over priced but then again, what ISN'T over priced in Vegas? The decor was pretty modern, the service was awesome and the food was above average. Would definitely go back again.
