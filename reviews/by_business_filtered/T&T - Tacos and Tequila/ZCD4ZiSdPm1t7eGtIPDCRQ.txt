I was craving Mexican food and Yelp mobile pointed me here to T&T as I glided over the strip in the tram. I was a little skeptical based on the mixed reviews, but I thought "what the hell."

When we arrived, I was a little disappointed with the cheezy decor and the hostess was quite the bitch.

Nevertheless, I chilled out with an ice cold Corona Light and my dining partner delighted in a margarita.

I had the cheese enchiladas, and let me tell you, the sauce was out of this fucking world. I mean... my mouth is watering right now just thinking about it.

He had the chile relleno, and it was equally as tasty!

I didn't really care for the red salsa, but the green salsa was pretty good.

Overall, I really liked the food and I would have rated it higher if hostess was not hardcore PMS'ing.
