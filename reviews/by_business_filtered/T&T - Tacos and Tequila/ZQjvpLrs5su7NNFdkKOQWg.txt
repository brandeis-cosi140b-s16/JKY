Happy hour and yummy margaritas!

My sister, brother-in-law, and I took the aunties and uncles who visited from all over the world here for happy hour. Located inside Luxor, the surrounding view from the restaurant was pretty neat!

We ordered a bunch of the appetizers and pitchers of margaritas. The service was excellent and fast. The food was typical happy hour food, all fried covered in cheese and meats which was of course, good. It was ok, nothing special or fancy but everyone got to try everything, and everyone was satisfied. 

It's a cool place to check out if you're in the area!
