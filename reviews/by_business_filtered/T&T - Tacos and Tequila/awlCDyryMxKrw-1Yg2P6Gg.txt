I came here with my husband for a quick bite to eat before seeing the Fantasy Show. I personally wanted Chinese food but after eating here I didn't regret it because the food was delicious! 

The service was a little slow at first but as soon as we let the waiter know that we are under a time constraint the food came out within like five minutes. They first served the free chips and salsa and then our dishes. 

My husband had the Beef Barbacoa Enchiladas ($18.00) . Since he was getting them I wanted to order something different. I wish I didn't because it was really good and that's coming from a girl who doesn't really eat Enchiladas. The beef was tender and the sauce had this sweet taste to it. 

I had the taco combo ($17.00) that came with Chicken, Carne Asada, and Carnitas. The meat was really tender and tasted fabulous with lime spritzed on them. The meals come with black beans and rice. I just opted for the rice which was also good it was nice and fluffy and not too salty. 

If you like tequila.... girls come around and pour it in your mouth. Kinda like they do if you ever went to a bar in Tijuana but minus the girls blowing on whistles while you do it. I didn't do it because I don't like tequila but my husband did. I don't think they charge for it because we didn't see it on our bill.
