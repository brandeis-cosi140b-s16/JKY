This place is overpriced but yummy. We came here on a whim for lunch and the service was great and there is a wide selection of margaritas to choose from which is nice. The white peach was very good!

The little tacos are not worth 13-15 for three though. I dunno, they were okay but could use some sour cream and guacamole..., just my opinion. 

The spareribs were yummy and we ordered the appetizer sampler which we didnt eat the tamale, it wasn't all that great, but the litle taquitos and nachos were.

Come here with an open mind and you will be okay!
