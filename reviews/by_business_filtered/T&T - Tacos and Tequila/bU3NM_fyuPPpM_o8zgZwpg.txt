I love their margaritas with the 2 beers sticking out! Only thing I didn't like about the place was how dark it was, being in the Luxor is just like that, an outside patio would of made it great! I was too involved with my beverage to really take in the food, but I remember it being exceptional. Nice servers as well! Give it a shot :)
