I tried T&T during a recent stay at the Luxor, and had really low expectations initially, but was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. The decor is tasteful, they have a nice sized bar, plenty of flat screens for watching the game, and my server was very friendly and attentive

I used a coupon from the Luxor guest book, and got 2 for 1 Dos Equis... The 2 salsas offered with the chips are flavorful, and they have a really good tequila menu with some hard to find (though pricey) selections. My pork carnitas entree was delicious, with a huge portion of meat served in a hot skillet with pickled onions. I highly recommend this dish.

Yes, it's expensive for Mexican food, but you're paying for convenience, and the food is actually good!
