Went during the week, which means an all male staff. No tequila temptresses, I guess they only work on Saturday (must be nice). The only girl I saw was the hostess and she was an a-hole. Our drinks were refilled pretty regularly, so that was good. The chips were stale, so we definitely got leftovers from the day before. The tacos were actually really good! Small as a packet of Equal, but good! (I have pictures I will post later to prove how small they are). The beans were gross but the rice was tasty. So all in all, if you're at the Luxor go ahead and eat there, but don't go out of your way. And maybe have a snack before you go lol.
