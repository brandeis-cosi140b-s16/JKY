In Vegas we stayed at the Luxor so we wanted to grab lunch somewhere convenient. T & T's is located inside the hotel up the escalator near the check in lobby. The lights are very dim up there but the seating area is nice.  It's kind of a romantic setting. They have a couple tvs where the bar area is. 

We were seated right away and our server stopped in to take drink orders. With checking into hotel we received a coupon for a free Margarita so we ordered one with waters. (We had already been drinking a bit so water sounded good) You can't mess up water, right? Well this was seriously the worst tasting water I have ever had. It tasted like toilet water and I haven't tasted toilet water before, but it was worse than tap. We didn't even drink it.

They started us off with chips and salsa. I enjoyed the chips which were pretty thick.I actually enjoyed them better than thin chips. Salsa had good flavor too. I ordered two chicken tacos which came with rice and beans. The tacos had a little kick to it but I felt needed more cheese or lettuce. It was missing something. Rice and beans were okay, nothing special. 

It's a cool spot if you want to get some quick food in the hotel that isn't fast food.
