Visited Vegas for two birthdays in our group and had dinner at T & T on 9/25/14.  This had to be one of the worse, and most expensive, dinners ever!  Their $12 margaritas were terrible, very sour, with almost no alcohol.  Two of us returned them to the bartender and the service was rude for the rest of the time.  I told the bartender in a mild mannered voice that those were the worse margaritas I've ever had, and I am a Cadillac margarita guy.  She and her male partner behind the bar, we all sat at the bar, were so rude and standoffish afterwards it was obvious they were seriously offended.  I had never experienced such bad service after returning something, which I rarely do.  The food was awful too, very expensive, and not worth it at all.  Our bill was over $240 for a party of 6 and none of us were satisfied with our meal, drinks, or experience.  I spoke to the manager afterwards, "Steve", and he completely did not care, offered no recourse, only said that he would talk to his bar staff, and hurried away.  I also complained to the hotel management at the Luxor, where the restaurant is located, and asked that someone contact me about this.  To date, nobody has.  This is a completely unprofessional establishment.  The drinks are horrible, the food is no where near worth the $20-25 a plate, and the service was beyond rude.  Save your time and money, and stay away from this place!!!
