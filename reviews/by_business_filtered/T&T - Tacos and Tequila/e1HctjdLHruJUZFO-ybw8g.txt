I'm giving this place 2 stars for several reasons: 

First, the service was poor. Our waiter seemed bothered to be there and was slightly rude to us while taking our orders. 

Second, the food was terrible. The salsa served before our meals tasted like it had ketchup in it. Yuckk. I ordered a Michelada with a Dos XX Light to drink and Chilaquiles for my main dish. I was not impressed with Michelada. Whatever mix they use was not tasty at all. The Chilaquiles were okay. It came with shredded chicken on top (which is not something typically found with Chilaquiles) and that's what I ate out of the whole dish because I was starting to feel slightly ill. 

Third, everyone I was with got sick afterwards!! My friend was in the bathroom for awhile while I held my stomach for half of the day. 

Never coming back.
