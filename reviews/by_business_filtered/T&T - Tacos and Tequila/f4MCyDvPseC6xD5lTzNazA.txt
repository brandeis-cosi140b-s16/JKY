I absolutely LOVE mexican food. Carne asada tacos are a staple food to me. Tacos and Tequila had some of the best tacos I have ever had. I have been to plenty of authentic mexican restaurants and T&T  was right on par with them. My friend had a Mahi Mahi dish I believe that was unbelievable. The guac is amazing too! I am obsessed with this place!

They have a pretty good happy hour as well.
