The hotel listing that I had said that this place opened at 7am.  WRONG!  They open at 11am.  Anyways I got there around 10:30am so I didn't have to wait long.

I am a huge fan of good mixed drinks, and this place had a good list of different margaritas and other drinks, but I settled for the 'Casarita' their house special margie.  It was basically a cadillac margarita, made with Gran Marnier and whatever else goes in there.  Damn those things were good.  I could have sat there a good portion of the day watchin football and drinking those things.

Chips, were not that great, they seemed too hard or maybe old.  But they weren't the worst I've ever had.  The accompanying salsas both green and red were both VERY good.  So that helped out the bad chips.  I just had a couple of appetizers and some drinks and watched some football and talked to one of the 'tequila temptresses'.  Shanna it was nice talkin to you and if you ever need to get out of that living situation you're in you can just give me a call. 

The food seemed fresh and was presented well.  I notice that a lot of the MGM properties are using a lot of the same plating techniques in a lot of their restaurants.  Pretty soon everything in Vegas is going to be very MGM-Mirage-ish.

Service was good, drinks very good, food was tasty, the restaurant was clean and stylish, the prices were not outlandish, the servers were all above average in hawt-factor and the most important thing about a 'Mexican' restaurant, the chips and salsa, were good overall.  I would definitely come back to this place again.
