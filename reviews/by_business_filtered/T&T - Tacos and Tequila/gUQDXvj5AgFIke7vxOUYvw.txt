Holy yum, they have the best happy hour EVER. We enjoyed nachos covered in everything good, guacamole, tortilla chips sugared and salted to perfection and 2 well drinks for $20. Yes, that's right, $20. 

Our bartender had to cover someone's shift/stay later -- lucky for us though! Seriously the best food and customer service we had at the Luxor or anywhere on the strip. He kept our food and beverages coming quickly with a genuine smile and checked back with us to make sure we were set. (I didn't catch his name, but he was on Happy Hour shift September 9th.) Give the man a raise please and clone him repeatedly.
