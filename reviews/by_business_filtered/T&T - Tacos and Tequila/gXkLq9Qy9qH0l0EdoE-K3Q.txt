A co-worker and I ventured to T&T for a lunch because we just so happened to be in vicinity of the Strip. This would not have been my first choice, but my co-worker said she had eaten her quite a few times when she used to work at the Luxor. 

Ambiance could be improved. The restaurant is located next to the Titanic and Bodies exhibit, also leaving the majority of the seating area exposed to the rest of the casino. 

Service was decent as we were there for lunch so we were not competing with a packed bar or a packed dining room for that matter. My friend and I were one of only a handful of parties there.

Chips & Salsa - Nice, warm, puffy chips, lightly salted with good texture and crunchiness. Comes with two salsas - a chipotle with some heat and my favorite, the green salsa with a nice tangy flavor.

My main entree - I opted for the al pastor tacos, comes with rice and beans. Beans and rice were perfectly fine. The tacos I have varying opinions. First off they did not skimp on the meat - my tacos were so filled (3 of them) I was not hungry when I left. I take issue with the way the al pastor was spiced - much, much sweeter than I have ever had before. Also, with the amount of meat in these tacos, it would have been nice had they done a double corn tortilla wrap.

Chicken nachos were had by my friend and although I did not try any the serving was HUGE. She did not finish them.

DO ask for extra chips.
DO try the hot sauces on the table.
DO not expect exemplary Mexican cuisine.

Strip pricing, expect to shell out a few extra bucks. Not my cup of tea. I'll stick to my off-strip Mexican joints for my al pastor fix.
