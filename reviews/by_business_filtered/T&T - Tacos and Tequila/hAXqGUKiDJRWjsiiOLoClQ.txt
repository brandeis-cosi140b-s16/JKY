I was excited to try this place after seeing the specials on FB and hearing some good stuff. We were having another quick bite as we were off to the club and wanted to go here. She had the chicken tortilla soup and some tacos and I had the Steak and bacon tacos. 

If was mediocre on my end, the only thing that wow'd us was the chicken tortilla soup.

Service was mediocre, he did bring us the check quickly though. Didn't have any drinks as we had been drinking most of the day. 

I dont think I would go back unless we were on a war path and did the Macho Borracho...
