Food was OK. I had fish tacos - the sauce was very good! Friends had veggie tacos - good, beef & bacon tacos - a little dry even though they were listed as the best tacos in Vegas. The tortillas were delish but there were 2 salsas.. didn't care for the green one. 2 for 1 margaritas were very strong!

Service wasn't that great.. we ordered guacamole as an appetizer and it wasn't coming, the waiter said it's on it's way... we got our mains and guy came back we told him we didn't want the guac anymore.
