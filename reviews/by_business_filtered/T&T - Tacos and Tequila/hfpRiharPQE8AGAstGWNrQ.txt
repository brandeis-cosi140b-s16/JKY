I was here on Memorial Day weekend, man the margaritas were weak and not made well.  The salsas were different than before.  This time they tasted like Embasa poured straight out of the can.  I had the tacos and for that price?  Please.  In LA we get those tacos on the corner for .75 cents each man, and you're charging me 14 bucks for three?  The food was not good, not worth it at all.   The waitresses....still hawt!  But hell theres hawt women all over in Vegas.  I'll be watching them from a better place next time.

If this is what all MGM Mirage properties are drifting toward in quality, I think I might have to find another multi-billion dollar company to give my wool to.
