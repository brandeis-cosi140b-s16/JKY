Nasty, nasty, nasty! Avoid this and any other restaurant in the Luzor! I eat a ton of Mexican food and ordered meals that I normally eat at home (like flutas) and it was disgusting! Even the salsa (with the complimentary chips) was disgusting.  No flavor what-so-ever.  And to top it off, when I ordered my salad, I explicitly said I can't eat dairy.  When I got my salad there were unidentifiable cheese chunks in it. The steak in the salad looked like it was already chewed up! My brother took two bites of his meal and didn't eat it. Nasty! Avoid! No bueno!
