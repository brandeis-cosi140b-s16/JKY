The complimentary chips and salsa at the start was really good, I really liked the green salsa in the yellow dish, the red salsa wasn't my cup of tea though. We both got tacos for our meal, the tacos themselves were delicious but the sides you get with them (rice and a weird looking bean concoction) could improve. The strawberry margarita is fantastic and my partner was really happy with the beer selection. Our waiter was great, he was enthusiastic and helpful.
