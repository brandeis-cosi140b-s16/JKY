Wow. Let me start by saying that I am born and raised in San Diego, CA and therefore I am VERY particular about my Mexican food. It would be surprising to me to find a restaurant in a hotel in Las Vegas that demolishes authentic San Diego Mexican cuisine, but in this particular dish I have found it. On Saturday and Sunday brunch in T&T the chicken chilaquiles would be a sin to pass up. You might be thinking "who could go wrong with some chilaquiles?" And that would be an appropriate thought. Until you try them here. These are on a whole different level. If you are near this strip on a Saturday or Sunday morning between 11-3 and you do not hit up T&T for this breakfast from the gods.. You are doing yourself a major disservice.
