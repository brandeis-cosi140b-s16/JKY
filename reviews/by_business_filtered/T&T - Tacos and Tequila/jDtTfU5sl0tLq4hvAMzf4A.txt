*  Welcome Experience
-  Ordinary

Friendly greeting.  Was seated right away.  Was given the choice of table or bar... 

*  Establishment
-  Outstanding  

It's Vegas.  Cool decor.  Big, gaudy, fun. Looks clean but can't tell cause it's dark!

*  Service
-  Encouraging

Probably would have been outstanding but nothing stood out.  Everyone was friendly and timely.  Definitely met my expectations and the server (Cara) was personable.  

*  Food Quantity / Quality / Presentation
-  Outstanding

I looked for a reason not to use the word "outstanding" and I couldn't really find one.  I ordered the shrimp tacos (pic) and an iced tea.  Both were exactly to my expectation.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and there was plenty of it.  (Menu boasts "grilled pineapple" but shouldn't because there was hardly any in there...

The beans and rice were flavorful.  The tortillas used for the tacos are tiny and not impressive.  I think they should change that but that's just preference.  They weren't bad.  (Quantity was just right)

Chips were fresh and crispy and accompanied by two kinds of blended salsa, tomatillo and tomato.  

*  What I'll remember
  
- Nice people (Cara)...   Great food.  Priced just right (not a bargain but I wasn't gouged either!)

*  What I can't wait to forget

- Nothing negative to report!  Will happily return to try something else from their menu!
