Honestly some of the worst "Mexican food" I've ever had... I had the nachos and I asked for no sour cream and very light cheese. What came out was a dairy disaster. The chicken was ice cold (possibly could be frozen?) and the jalepenos aren't fresh they're obviously from a jar. Bartender was absent for the entire meal. Only time I saw her was to take my order and give me my check. I had a gift card that I used but all in all 1 order of nachos and 1 margarita came out to $35. I won't be returning. 

Oh and I didn't appreciate the bartenders all huddled up making fun of previous guests. Very unprofessional.
