Really enjoyed both our meals here!  My husband got their "best in Vegas" taco's and I had the tortilla soup. Very yummy. We enjoyed it so much we went back 2 days later for more.  It will be my mission to recreate the tortilla soup!

My only  suggestion is that they turn down the horrible "mix tape" music.  
Its so loud you cant hear yourself think. Its a restaurant not a night club.
Would have been 5 starts if not for the music
