My first time in Vegas I was put up at the Luxor. My coworker and friend John called me and I met him at the T & T. This meeting led to one of the most memorable experiences in the while time spent in that wild and crazy city of  Las Vegas. The tequila menu was huge and slightly intimmidating. We asked Amy, our beautiful and skilled bartender what her favorite tequila was. She honestly directed us towards two excelent glasses of Clase azule Eprosado. A bit out of my usual price range, Amy started me on a new found love of Tequila. A long story short: Amy is awesome, I came back home to Memphis and have been trying out more Tequila and will always remember that special night drinking tequila at the T & T in the Luxor.
