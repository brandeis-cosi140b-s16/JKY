This place -might- have been a 3 and then I saw the bill. Everything here was just so so. They are a wannabe Pink Taco (Hard Rock) and don't really live up to it. The food isn't as good (they have a lot of the same dishes) and did I mention how freaking expensive it was? $100 for two people sharing 1 app (ceviche) and 1 entree (grilled chicken), 3 beers, and 2 tequilas (correalejo repasado). Will say service was good but that's about their only redeeming quality.
