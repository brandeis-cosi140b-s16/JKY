I visited this restaurant while staying at the Luxor, I'm not usually a huge salsa fan, but I really enjoyed the hot salsa which came with the complimentary tortilla chips before the meal. Service was fast and friendly, I ordered the Carne Asada Tacos and they were excellent and came with a side of rice and refried beans, I had one taco (you get 3) and a good amount of rice and beans leftover at the end of the meal which I saved for later along with some of the tortilla chips. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was that I felt that it was on the pricey side for Mexican food.
