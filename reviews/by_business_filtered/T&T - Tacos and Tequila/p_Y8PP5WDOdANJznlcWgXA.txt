Stayed at the Luxor and went to T and T for dinner, chips were freshly made flour tortilla, salsas fresh, and service was pretty good....my husband ordered the fis burro and it was very fresh and tortilla soup was great! Only complaint was that the water was straight out of the tap, yuck! Not everyone wants booze when they are in Vegas, I was so thirsty after having spent the day in pool and I just wanted h2o, I guess next time I will ask first. Solid four stars for food!
