Not good. Ordered the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. Rice was undercooked, green sauce too sweet and the salsa? I have always said you know how good a cantina or mexi place is by their salsa...I should have gone with that after the first bite but no! My friend ordered the mahi mahi and our server started talking about how she swam along side one in Hawaii and now felt compassion for them....(the sound of tires screeching) wait what? Wrong thing to say to a customer. She didn't know any better she was just trying to make convo but hey, there is somethin to be said about thinking before you speak. Anyway, this place is Straight up yuck... too smoky, too sweet. I know that they're goin for a southwest vibe but it just didn't cut the mustard.
