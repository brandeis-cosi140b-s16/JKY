Wow, we really enjoyed the food here. When we checked in, we got a card giving us a free tequila shot from this restaurant. We ordered the nachos and the fajitas, and were not let down in any shape or form. We also got drinks, regular and pomegranate margaritas. All great and very tasty. If you are at the Luxor this is the restaurant to go to!
