I've only ever had drinks and the #1 Alembra tacos for a snack here which has grilled steak, bacon and Oaxaca cheese. Haven't ordered much food to go off of for a better review but the taco alone with drinks and service is enough to give it the four stars. 

I always have a good time at T&T. Great service, cool bartenders and that taco is awesome. Lots of flavor and very meaty.

Eventually I'll order other dish's and update my review but I can't see myself not ordering this taco on any visit haha.
