Found an amazing Groupon deal for our mini vacay...two chonga (42 oz!) margaritas (mind you they come with 2 beers in them as well) for $20. After checking out their website we decided their food looked too good to pass up. So we strolled up around 830 on a Saturday night. There was a 30 minute wait which seemed reasonable for a Saturday in Vegas on a holiday weekend. The place is actually quite cute, its an open air restaurant in the pyramid at Luxor. Small for sure and if you're looking for just the margaritas they have a small stand across from the restaurant. 

I ordered the enchiladas and they were some of the best that I have ever had! I would gladly come back! The margaritas were also amazing and did the trick (plus we got to keep the glasses!). Even the chips and salsa before the meal was good. The prices weren't bad so if you're in the Luxor, definitely check it out!
