A great little hidden gem inside the Luxor Hotel. After a long bus trip to see The Grand Canyon, the comfortable atmosphere and delicious food from T&T hit the spot. Service was friendly and quick to respond to any requests. Food was hot and tasty. Price was perfect. If every in Vegas again would choose to dine here.
