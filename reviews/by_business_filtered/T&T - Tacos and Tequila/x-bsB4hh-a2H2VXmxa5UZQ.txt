In the area for a Yelp event and in need of a very quick bite, we were limited to the food court and T&T. I perused their Happy hour menu and figured it was a reasonable deal. I have been dieting lately so was limited to basically just guacamole on the menu. My friend ordered the nachos. 

Since we were in a hurry we  didn't make our order too complicated. Food came out quickly and it was standard. Nothing amazing but I did enjoy that the spicy guacamole I ordered actually did have quite a kick. My friend enjoyed her nachos as well. Portions were and we walked our in just enough time to get to our event on time. Even better, our meal was just over $11. Not bad, I'll admit for strip dining.
