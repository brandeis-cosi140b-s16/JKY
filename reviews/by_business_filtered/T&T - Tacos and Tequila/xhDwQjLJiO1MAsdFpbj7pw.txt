One of m favorite places to eat. All the food here is good. Located on the second floor of the Luxor next to the Titanic exhibit. You got music playing and when there is not you have a small group of Mexican singers with instruments singing at your table. The chopped salad is my favorite. Tortilla soup is pretty good. Homemade chips. Green salsa is the best. Not to fond of the red salsa. Bartenders are super nice. Love to eat at the bar. Usually don't wait long to get your food. Sort of a dark place. Not a lot of light Except at the bar. They have t.v's at the bar. Highly recommend it.
