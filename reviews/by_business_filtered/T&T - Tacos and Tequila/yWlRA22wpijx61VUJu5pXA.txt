I absolutely love this place, and it is a must-stop every time I'm in Las Vegas. 

Located inside the pyramid of the Luxor hotel, this place has the best margarita that I have ever had. It's a spicy margarita with cucumber and cilantro, and it's absolutely fantastic - to the point that I made them give me the recipe so I could start making them myself. They have a wide variety of tequilas to choose from, as well as full liquor bar. Margaritas range from about $10-15.

For food they have a great selection of tacos including steak, pork, chicken, and fish. They also have various dinner platters to choose from, but I always end up choosing some type of tacos. The quality is all fantastic, and food is served with homemade chips and salsa. The guacamole is also excellent, as well as their queso. 

If you're in Vegas, or especially inside the Luxor, I highly recommend this place.
