Is it expensive? Yes. Is the food tasty? It's good enough. I went here a couple of times during my stay in Vegas a while back. The tacos are not the best I've ever had, but the quesadilla was pretty good. The dishes are well presented and the service was prompt. I recommend the Blueberry Smash cocktail, especially before boarding that plane out of Vegas.
