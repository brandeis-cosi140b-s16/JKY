We were a party of 8 on a Friday night so the wait was about 45 mins. Once we got seated the service was spot on and the waitress was very cute. We had some coupons from down stairs and it worked out good. I had the azule tacos, which were good. the servicing sizes were a little small. Our bills was I think 40 per person and that's with two drinks each. I will return if I'm not in a hurry and not the hungry. The wait staff is worth seeing.
