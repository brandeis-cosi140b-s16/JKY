WOW- what great Carne Asada!  5 STARS for little non-descript strip mall restaurant with some AMAZING food!

Someone brought this into work for lunch, and I'm hooked.

I've been ONCE, and did not stay to eat there.  I ordered a large take-out order.  The smell is heavenly.  This is a little "hole in the wall" type of place in a west-side strip mall.  I went out of my way (geographically)  to get this, and will make a special trip there again soon!  If this was near home, we'd be having it at least one night a week.

Their little tortillas are so GOOD- freshly made, and i am especially partial to the flour tortillas.

Smoky, salty meat.  VERY flavorful and generous portions.  The sauces and salsa buffet provide great selections for your garnishes.

Next time  you are in the neighborhood, stop in and pick up dinner for the family- they will thank you!
