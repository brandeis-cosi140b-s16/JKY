I come here at least once a week. Not a fan of the burritos but they do taco's very well. Anything you get, carne asada, pork, it's all good. The dining experience is different, you go to the counter, pick what you want, then you either get a tray or to go box for the salad/salsa bar. You pay after your food is done, which is interesting but makes things quick.

This place and La Santisima are my favorite taco places. TaCarbon being the better deal.
