Great food but the service is really bad. Especially at nights, the servers who usually work late are very rude and so is the manager. 
   If you are new, expect to be confused and know that they won't offer to explain or help you and if you ask for anything, you will get dirty looks. I gave them no tip, which is rare, coming from me. Bad service overall.
