Very good... We got the family meal, asada and adobada.  Asada was cut in small tiny peaces and didn't have chunks of chewy fat as sometimes we get at other places. Adobada was soft, juicy and flavorful. We got a lot of small tortillas perfect for making the tacos, lots of good salsas. Price was good for the amount of food we got. Had lunch and dinner for family of 5.
