Tacos here are good because of the meat and the small flour tortillas which make them the closest thing to the real thing (mexico street tacos).  The bar with the salsas and other condiments is well stocked but the "water guacamole" and the veggies are not seasoned well and don't complement the tacos very well.

Place is always crowded which means tacos are good, just don't expect a quiet comfortable dining experience because you will be rubbing elbows with people.

If compared with Mexico tacos this place falls short, but compared to everything else around here in Phoenix, this place is pretty good, top 3 taco places in the city that's for sure.
