Ta Carbon is really a play on words on the traditional Mexican saying "Esta cabron". But rightfully said so, this place esta cabron, this place is badass! 
Its small, set in a corner of a strip mall, almost hidden, but it gets lots of repeat business and its like going to someones house for a bbq! 
The grill is on fire with four cooks on stand by, theres a salsa buffet style setting with lots of delicious salsas to choose from. 
Their carne asada has got to be some of the best in town, and the food is always served right off the grill. Dont be scared, if you want badass Mexican food straight from the grill, this place is sthe shit!
