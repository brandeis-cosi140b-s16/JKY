Great food for pocket change.  Let me explain, $1.75 for an asada taco or marinated pork taco.  If you are really hungry go for the asada burrito and $4.50 later you could feed yourself and a guest.  If your thirsty buy a 12 ounce 2.50 Tecate to wash it down.

Seriously inexpensive and great grilled flavor on the meat.  Maybe because they have an open fire grill inside.  Just be prepared, its gets warm inside maybe in the 80s when I was there and with the crowd of people ordering to go it gets warm.  Just slightly uncomfortable hot, like almost breaking a sweat.  If you can't deal with it order to go the meat is worth it.

Also please don't go here expecting great customer service or a great atmosphere, this is a simple 35 max capacity room that grills meat.  Go for the food and that is what my review reflects.  I did not go here expecting red carpet service, please do the same and bring a hearty appetite.

If you are looking for this place it is not on the main street of camelback it is situated facing west and is north of the Orileys auto parts.  I was almost disappointed because I went at night and it took me 5 minutes to drive around the almost abandoned shopping center to find it on the far north corner.  It also did not help all the windows are blacked out at the restaurant.

I will be going back for a to go order so I can impress my coworkers with my new found asada burrito that puts all others to shame.  Till I find another great place I have conquered the quest of best lunch burrito.
