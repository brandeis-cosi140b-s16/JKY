I can't find a better Mexican grill anywhere. I'm addicted to their pastor, asada, and quesadillas. Their service has improved, so it's only a few minutes for my meal on even the most crowded days. And the prices are modest for the quality of your meal. Next time you're in the west valley and want Mexican, come HERE. If you had another place in mind, I doubt it's as good!
