This place wins me over every time.  Can't go wrong with any meat but the carne asada is Sonoran perfection.  Their salsa bar is small but packed with goods.  What amazes me is the same guys continue to work here EVERY time I come.  Seems like family.  

Always feels strange to not pay first when ordering but you'll be glad you haven't cashed out when you go for seconds :)

I give em 4 instead of 5 stars for their awkward standing around bumping into each other waiting for your name to be called.  Better to look or listen for a number on intercom.
