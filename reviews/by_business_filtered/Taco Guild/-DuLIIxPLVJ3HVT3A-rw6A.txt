Usually, I really like the tacos here but I had a terrible experience that forced me to go somewhere else from now on. Tried to park here only to find that half of the parking spots were empty and blocked by green cones. I called the restaurant to inquire about the parking situation only to hear that those spots were for valet parking which wouldn't start for another fifteen minutes. Don't start taking valet spots if you aren't going to start the valet yet. No apologies or solutions were offered which prompted me to immediately drive somewhere else. Really, parking and common courtesy are the first steps to a successful business, if you can't get that right then no one will go there.
