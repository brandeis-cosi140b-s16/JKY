My wife and I are special needs customers (TLC requests for diet, etc) and happened into TG this afternoon. You know who we are TG:) The menu is a tasty cacophony of VERY creative southwest items

Marian could not have been more gracious and helpful throughout our menu item search and tasting. She is a budding litttle superstar.

 Justin, who should be the Manager, is a fantastic ambassador for the TG Brand.  While we did not find a nirvana meal today, we know we will on our next try.

When an establishment  has a Team who walk and talk the same message, you know that Ownership has a culture most establishments only hope for or dream about. 

AND- What an immaculate re-purposing of a beautiful little church.

Impressive!!!
