Terrible service. Good food. Am sitting here right now while my husband finishes he enchiladas. He took his first bite of food as I was taking my last. Food is delivered at different times. Not the first time. Two nights ago at dinner, his are his tacos before my dinner salad was delivered. Unacceptable. Deserts are delicious. I recommend the flour less chocolate cake. If you want a refill on your water, prepare to be thirsty. Unless you ask some random employee who happens to be walking by, you have to wait for your waiter. Today, our waiter seems to be hiding in the kitchen.
