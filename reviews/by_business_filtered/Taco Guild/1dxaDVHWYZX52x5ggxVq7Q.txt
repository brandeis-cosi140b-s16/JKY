Very fun place good food, cool building with the church thing going; I'm really surprised the reviews aren't stronger.  I took a client here while in town and we had a very nice lunch.  

Food
Solid, I can't remember everything I ordered but 3 tacos is good size order here- everything at least sounded good and everything I had was.
