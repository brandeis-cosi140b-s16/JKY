The food doesn't stand a chance when the service is severely lacking.  
As mentioned in all the other reviews, the building is beautiful.  Now to what is important...
We were a party of 6 and it was a Friday night at 8 pm, but it still should not take 25 minutes for our cocktails to arrive after we ordered them.  And when they did start to arrive, they came out a couple at a time.  So by the time we all had drinks, some were ready for round 2.  And we all thought the margaritas were more like large shots.  3 sips and the drink was empty.  Small glasses, lots of ice.  Decent taste though.
I will say the salsa was decent and the warm chips were great.  The tacos were just ok.  I have had much better tacos for a lot less.  And the sides were forgettable.  
I would return to try other tacos, but the service just left a really bad taste in my mouth.  It just fell short.  From the terribly long wait for the drinks, to having to search the entire restaurant for the server to get a bill, it all just was disappointing.  
We had 2 apps to share, 2 cocktails each, 3 tacos each with 1 side and the bill was $46 per person.
