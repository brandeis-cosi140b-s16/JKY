Our plan was to order tacos but our waitress sold us on the grilled salad and it was incredible.  The chips and salsa they serve are delicious and a nice variety.  The atmosphere is great and unique.  You could enjoy a big meal here or just split some appetizers - you can't go wrong.  Service was great and we can't wait to go back.
