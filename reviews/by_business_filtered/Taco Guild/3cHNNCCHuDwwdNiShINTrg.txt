Very very cool. The building and decor is impressive and tucked in a neighborhood that continues to thrive. 

I ordered the guava/rosemary/tequila cocktail which was fragrant and original. The perfect blend of herbal infused sweetness with no battle between each flavor. 

The Chipotle Cherry Steak tacos are nothing short of incredible. I ordered mine with bleu cheese, making it decadent yet virtually guilt free given its small portion (not that I care much about that sort of thing.)

Overall I love the restaurant's appreciation for educating its customers. Their website offers a section where one can get familiarized with tequila terminology (Tequila Academia), which adds intrigue to their carefully crafted cocktails. 

Because we visited on a Friday night, the music was loud. I did wish the sound selections were a bit more flavorful. A place this cool deserves a steady rotation of War and Santana to keep the spice just right!
