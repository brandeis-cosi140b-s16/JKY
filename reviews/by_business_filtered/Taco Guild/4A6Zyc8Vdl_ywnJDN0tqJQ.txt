Great tacos, the chicken was especially good.  The street corn was probably over 1000 calories from the butter and cheese, good but not my style.  The salsas and hot sauces provided were awesome.  Then there's something about ordering and drinking a great local beer inside a church where the Holy Water flowed warmed my cockles.   Friar Tuck would be proud.   Great experience on my two visits and I will be back.    Service was descent as well.
