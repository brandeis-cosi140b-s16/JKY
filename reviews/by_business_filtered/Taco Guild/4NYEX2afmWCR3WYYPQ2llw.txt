Busy lives we all lead I have driven past this place at least 100 times and of course have said we need to stop here so today we did and it was better then expected. The building has so much history the server Jaycen was excellent. The tacos are more like street tacos wish they were a little bigger but the flavor they pack is over the top. I had the Peking Duck, Al-Pastor and Thai snapper all three I would get again.  If you are looking for some place unique and looking for Mexican this is the place.
