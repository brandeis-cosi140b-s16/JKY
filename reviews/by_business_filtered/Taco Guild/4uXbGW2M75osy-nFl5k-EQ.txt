The atmosphere is what makes this place. Set in an old methodist church, it is a great vibe. You'll even catch a Scripture taken totally out of context, "Be Perfect". But seriously, the service was outstanding. Ashley was our server and she helped us through the menu as this was our first time here. They even treated us to a dessert on the house. 

The tacos were good, not great, but good. My wife and I had the lamb, cherry steak, braised beef, and the duck. Each of the tacos seemed to be a little dry though. My favorite was the lamb with the blue cheese. I'm not usually a fan of corn tortillas but they make them in house (I think) and they were pretty bombski. 

All in all, I would definitely come back especially because of their service.
