My husband and I were in town from Colorado to visit our college daughter for her birthday. The hotel we stayed at recommended The Taco Guild. We came for brunch on Sunday. The atmosphere was beyond incredible.  Such a good job was done on preserving the church the restaurant is located in. The stained glass windows are fabulous, the re purposed light fixtures are amazing! When the chips and offering of salsas came they didn't disappoint. There was spicy options for my fire loving Hubby and daughter and more mild yet flavor filled option for me. I ordered the veggie omelet and it was so yummy! The veggies inside went way beyond the regular offering of peppers and mushrooms I usually find. There was asparagus,  thin sliced Brussels sprouts and so much more! I loved the mismatched china, great touch! My family loved their taco combos. I look forward to our next visit to Arizona and the Taco Guild!
