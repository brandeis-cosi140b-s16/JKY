My overall experience at Taco Guild was very pleasurable. The restaurant might not look like more than an old church from the street but as soon as you get to the doors you know you are in for a real treat! The interior design of the restaurant is to die for. They converted me to a "Taco Guild Believer" soon as I walked in! The beautiful ambience of the restaurant and the delicious chips and salsa set the bar very high for the quality of the food. I have had several varieties of their tacos and a burrito. I would highly recommend the tacos over the burritos. The beef tacos are significantly better than any seafood tacos (which are poor in flavor).

The three star rating is because the drinks are lacking in both size and strength but still high in price. I would definitely return during happy hour. It looks like they had a great happy hour special on both food and drink
