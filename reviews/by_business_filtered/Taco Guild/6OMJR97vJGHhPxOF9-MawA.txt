We decided to go to this rehabbed church for cinco de mayo.  The atmosphere is so cool with the stained glass windows and mural on the wall.  The bar looks awesome, though we sat in the booth.

That tacos are mostly good.  There were very few that I didn't like.  During happy hour, the taco of the day (that day was pork carnita) is only 2 dollars.  We got 3 tacos (you get 1 free side then and the rice is a must try) and 3 of the happy hour tacos and were stuffed at the end of it.  

Like I said the rice is awesome.  Its got more flavor that you typically get, bits of corn also adds to the appeal.  I really liked the pork adovada and the carnita.  The others were decent but not too exciting - shrimp, duck, guild chicken.

A definite must try if only for the scene!
