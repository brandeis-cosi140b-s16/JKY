Honestly, the atmosphere is amazing. The interior design, flawless. Super cool vibe and our waitress was very attentive and helpful, one of the best i've met in a while. The only reason we are giving 2 stars is because of the tacos. We were expecting amazing tacos. The appetizer- ceviche was definitely delicious, the chips that came with were my fave! However, we were disappointed as soon as the main entree came. We eat tacos all the time, especially in Az- you can go to the taco trucks and have an amazing meal for $1- $2 a piece. Just because their "fancy" doesn't necessarily mean they are good.  If they fix that, the place would be a 5 star quality restaurant.
