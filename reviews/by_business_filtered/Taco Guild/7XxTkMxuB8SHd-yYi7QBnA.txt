This place has instantly become my favorite place for tacos. Upon entering we were greeted, and promptly seated. The waitress then took our order, she was very nice. The atmosphere is really unique here, converted from an old church. Its a wonderful clash of old and new.

The free chips they serve you while you wait come with an assortment of salsas. Ranging from guacamole dip to a mango salsa with some heat. I ordered the special of the day ,orange glazed chicken tacos. Just wow, let me tell you, very very good. I got three of them, skipped dessert, and was more than full. 

This is certainly a place that I will be revisiting. The service, atmosphere and food were all great. Next time I will probably get something a little different just to be adventuresome.
