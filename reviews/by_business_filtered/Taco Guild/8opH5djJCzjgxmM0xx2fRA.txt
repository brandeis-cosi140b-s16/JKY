Everything was very good. The drinks are yummy and the tacos I got (chipotle cherry steak and el pastor pork) were amazing. Favorite is definitely chipotle cherry steak. Husband said his beef enchiladas were good but not the best he's had, but he liked the flour-less chocolate cake dessert, which was really rich and reminded me of a chocolate mousse instead of a cake. Well be back for happy hour for sure! Our server Sam was very sweet and attentive.
