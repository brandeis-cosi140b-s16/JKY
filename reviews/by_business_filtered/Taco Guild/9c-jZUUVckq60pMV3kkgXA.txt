We got take-out tonight and several things were wrong when we opened everything up at home. My meal consisted of the house salad and onion straws. The salad was missing the avocado and onion straws did not come with the aioli sauce. So annoying! Especially since the salad came with few toppings anyway. The salad was very bland...probably since it was made with iceberg lettuce. Green leaf lettuce or spinach would elevate this salad. 

My husband asked that they not add jalapenos to the guacamole but it parts of it were very spicy. Not sure what else would have made it hot. My husband liked his tacos but my meal was a total fail. Seems like they need to iron out a few kinks.
