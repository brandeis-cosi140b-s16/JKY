Went there a few weeks ago, heard so much about it and had to check it out. Love the interior and it has kind of a hip/trendy vibe (without being too much). Really enjoyed the decor.

Had a margarita, some tacos and a side and it was very, very tasty. Do plan on coming back.

The only issue I had that I noticed when I was looking at my online banking, the processing charge on the card I used was 20% more than the receipt, which left me confused (also I tipped with cash instead of on my card). I called the following day and talked to a manager, they said it was charge for the proper amount and wasn't sure why it showed up as a higher charge. Maybe it was because it's a fairly new business or with my bank (BOA), but wasn't completely clear why. When the charge was processed, it was for the proper amount. Not sure why that happened, maybe next time I'll pay in cash...
