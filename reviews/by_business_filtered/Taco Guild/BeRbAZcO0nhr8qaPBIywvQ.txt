I really want to like this place but the food is too inconsistent and the service is highly dependent on what waiter you get. 

It's almost like dining here for the first time on each visit. You have no idea what the al pastor tacos will end up tasting like. The homemade corn tortillas taste like homemade garbage. Pray that the waiter remembers to ask if you would prefer flour tortillas. Hint: you do.

The only bright spot is the Mexican street corn which is probably the unhealthiest thing on their menu.

I am almost embarrassed at how many check-ins I have at the taco guild. I have a theory that the prime location is the  only thing Keeping it in business.

Stay away
