Love this restaurant! Cool interior and vibe. The server was on it! Very knowledgable and helpful. Great DJ on Friday night. The duck taco rocked!! Just don't order it at the same time as the lamb taco. Kind of like drinking a shot of whiskey and tequila back to back. On their own delicious. Why this place was not packed is beyond me. Wake up Phoenix a great restaurant is in your town!!
