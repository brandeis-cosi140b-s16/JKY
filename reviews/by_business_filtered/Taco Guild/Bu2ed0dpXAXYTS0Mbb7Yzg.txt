I have been to the Taco Guild twice now.  I can't say I won't ever go back, but it is not a place that will be in my rotation.  I have now done lunch and dinner.  If you want to have a conversation, the noise level in the evening is going to make that difficult.  between the music and the high ceilings you will need your loud voice--

I give the place credit for a wonderful reuse of space.  visually that restaurant is spectacular and it is worth going once just for that.  

The service is hot and cold. I got there early for dinner and was seated immediately.  I finally had to get someone's attention after 10 minutes or so --to get a glass of wine and some water.  to the waiter's credit--there was an apology for the wait--but i really hate being ignored--some sort of acknowledgement is all that is needed to lower that frustration even if they can't get to you immediately.  I also have to say for the rest of the evening the service was fine.

Now the food--it is okay--Unless they really do something to improve it--it will never be the reason why people come here.  Someone in our party ordered one taco--even on a salad size plate--it was very very small--for $4 a taco you just expect them to be extraordinary of which they are definitely not.  I had a chicken burrito--it was okay--chick was dry and not much flavor.  

If you want really good food--go to your favorite neighborhood place or someplace like gallo blanco or richardson's.  

Taco Guild will be fine to meet for happy hour and a drink--but there are much better places to spend your dining $$$ for good food.
