I ordered a cup of tortilla soup and a few tacos for take out for my boss and I. The tortilla soup was delicious. Chunks of yummy chicken in a broth laden with melted cheese and a little kick. I also had the al pastor taco. Tender pork cooked in sweet and spicy yumminess. It also had pickled onions, which I loved. The tortilla was soft, but held together very well, even when I kinda rolled up the whole thing to eat. BossMan had the Guild Chicken and Yucatan Shrimp tacos, which he really enjoyed. 

The three tacos were a plate dish that included one side and I chose their rice. It had corn, which I love, and was good, but overall it wasn't anything spectacular. Our order also came with a bag full of delicious freshly fried tortilla chips. Probably some of the best I've ever had!

The taco plate and cup of soup with tax was $16+...a little on the pricy side considering my favorite tacos are the $1-2 authentic street tacos, but Taco Guild will be a good treat once in a while! This point is where they lack in receiving a 5-star review. 

The restaurant is located in a renovated old church and I think they did a wonderful job keeping the beauty of it. Even though everything is new, it has that old world feel to it.

Also to note, I believe it was created by the owners of Z'Tejas, so a lot of their flavors may have been brought over. My boss said the tortilla chips and salsa were similar, as well as the looks of my tortilla soup.
