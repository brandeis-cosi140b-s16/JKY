Awesome building!   Aspiring concept.   Poor delivery:  service is very slow...even for  bottled- beer orders.  We received our food in phases each person served minutes apart- not in tandem as is expected.     Poor choice of placing a music box to enhance the aural experience. ..and at the clients' expense.  Tried the mixed drinks to no better satisfaction: too sweet...and smaller portions than customary.  Tacos are just OK.  Substandard  dining experience  in a beautiful setting.
By far La Condesa Restaurant is a much better choice for authentic and delicious tacos served graciously: although not as dressed up a place.
