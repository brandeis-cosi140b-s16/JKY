I was driving by and saw what looked to be a church but it said Taco Guild.  Tacos in an old church?  Sounded cool so I pulled in and parked.  

Taco Guild has very interesting and innovative tacos.  I only had two.  The Urban Bean Coffee Braised Beef taco with caramelized onion, mango,  jicama relish, and Cotija cheese was fantastic.  What great flavors.  

I also had the Yucatecan Shrimp taco.  Again very good and not too spicy, which is a problem I find at many restaurants.

They bring out chips, which again are good as well as several salsas.  I found the main red salsa to be a bit watery.  I believe the orange salsa may have been a habanero salsa, and there was an avocado salsa I believe.  

Nevertheless, with the fantastic atmosphere inside and very friendly waitstaff , I am giving this place 5 stars.  Highly recommended!
