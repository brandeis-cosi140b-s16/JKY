Let me start by saying we really were excited to try this place and really wanted to like it!
The service was okay, our server was pretty busy and we take that into account. 
The place was really cool, old church. Live music busy but not packed. 
The food presentation was beautiful, it looked great but just fell flat at every turn.  
Chips and salsa, decent nothing great. We ordered the guacamole and queso dip duo, the dip was decent the guacamole was f.l.a.t. We have never not finished guac before last night :(
We both ordered the tacos trio with the street corn. Our food arrived looking amazing! Sadly it was cold and again very flat. 
Just not worth the hype. We may go again but probably not. 
I think there are plenty of other great Mexican places that may not be as cool but the food service and price are better.
