This location is so cool! I love the decor and concept of the restaurant. The menu is pretty small, but the tacos are good. I had the short rib & the chicken, with a side of corn. The corn was delicious and so was the chicken taco. I will skip the short rib next time. Service was great, and so were the different hot sauces to try.
