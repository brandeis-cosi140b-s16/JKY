The old church building that this place is in in phenomenal.  What they have done with the inside is just extraordinary (except the lame TVs that are playing way above the bar...take those out!) 
Right when I walked in, I felt like this was gonna be a great place to take anyone that is in town that wants to see a cool spot....until I ate.  I'm not going to say that the food was bad, but the Tacos don't even grace a spot in my Top 10 taco places in Phoenix.  They are okay, but just feel very corporately made....very standard products, bad tortillas, no love at all.  

I would not suggest going here.
