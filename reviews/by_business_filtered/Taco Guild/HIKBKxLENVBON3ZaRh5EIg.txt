Beautiful place with great food, the chips and salsa are to die for. They have a wide variety of margaritas that are all worth trying. I have been there twice this past week and loved it all, the tacos are amazing and the sweet potato chicken tortilla soup is outstanding. Fun spot and I'm glad Z'Tejas built this is in phx.
