Fun place. Friends had recommended it, just got around to going here as its off my usual paths. Great decor and environment in a former church.  Good beer selection. Liked the chips and dips.  I tried the chipotle cherry steak, Peking duck, and pork tacos all were excellent...fresh ingredients and lots of flavor.  I'll be back to try more...
