While waiting for service on my motorcar a few blocks away, I stumbled across a historic church bldg dating back to 189something that was converted into a restaurant, specializing in unique and equally tasty tacos like "thai coconut curry red snapper." Among an otherwise ubiquitous landscape of corporate empires, a unique find indeed. Why not 5 stars? They forgot to give me a place setting (fork and knife). Otherwise great service.
