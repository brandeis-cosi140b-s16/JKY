I love the decor of this place! It's in an old church and there is a lot of history to the building, which can be seen on the walls. I do wonder how Jesus feels about alcohol being served in a once place of worship? C'mon! I had to wonder?! That wondered, I did not love the chips nor the salsa; that's kind of a make it or break it for me. The next thing was that we made it with 45min to spare on happy hour. Not paying attention, we ordered Margs on the rocks ... But later realized the marg on the happy hour menu was 'frozen' , NOT on the rocks. Hmm. Okay. So I guess I wasn't impressed with the fact that they are probably out of one of those slush pre-made machines. A good list of drinks though; just limited, VERY limoted on happy hour drinks. On to food; I had the Thai fish curry taco; a chicken and the duck taco. The duck stated that it had Brie cheese , but I was not able to prove that. I did like the taste of it but the fish was my favorite. Ordered the shoe string onions to go with and again, meh. To follow it up, they were out of all the desserts except two. We tried the lemon tarte and it reminded me of a 'not all the way cooked' pie, yet tasted like
Lemon meringue with no meringue. Weird. Ambience and staff great. But one sinner to another .. Fill thine menu with more sinning drinks , please.
