Fun atmosphere with very helpful staff. Menu include tequila flights - dependent upon your wallet, street taco - order three and add a side. The tortillas are made the same day -- super fresh and tasty. I tried the pork adovado and shrimp .. the pork was one of the best tacos I have ever had. the shrimp was tasty. Sat at the bar - bartender John.. great attitude and service. only draw back was the marg - only had it frozen on happy hour - would have like it on the rocks at happy hour price ($5) -- having said that - it was a good marg.
