Taco Guild is wonderful!! 

The old church atmosphere is cool and the service was beyond amazing. There were so many helpful people that were all very attentive. The juke box is a little weird as far as creating a "vibe" in the restaurant, but that can be easily remedied.

As for the food: I got two Yucatan shrimp tacos and a snapper taco. The shrimp was SO flavorful with just the right amount of toppings in the tortilla. The snapper was very tasty, but not my favorite. My husband got an al pastor, lamb, and a cherry beef taco. He raved about the beef the most! For a Sunday afternoon, the service was fast and the food was so fresh and tasty! We will definitely come back for more...soon!
