Awesome atmosphere, great service, and couldn't be more pleased with our happy hour decision to come here. We ordered tacos, sweet corn, and spoiled ourselves with tres leches cake. Everything was delivered quickly and tasted amazing. I loved the style of the place. They played good music and didn't overwhelm you with TV's (only two high up behind the bar). They only turned on the TV volume for the Kentucky Derby race but immediate turned it back to music after the race was over and everyone cheered for the triple crown winner. I will definitely be back for more tacos.
