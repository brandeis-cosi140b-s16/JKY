so I decided to get some takout from Taco Guild and have a drink at the bar. The design of this place is AWESOME!!! it's like an old church in there with the stained glass windows, tons of wood beams and huge gothic looking chandeliers. I had a margarita on teh rocks, just the perfect margarita. For food, I wetn with three tacos: The peking Duck, the Lamb Molida and the Carne Adovado. The wife had the house salad and a side of crispy onions. Now I will say the tacos are a touch expensive at $5 each for the specialty tacos, but they're quality and loaded with great ingredients. My fave, hands down, was the Peking Duck. it had this peanut and carrot slaw and just perfectly fatty roasted duck..stupid good. I wasn't a fan of the molida lamb taco, it just tasted funky. Teh adovado was pretty good, and had a great apricot chutney on top that worked well with it. From my experience, it was 3.5 starts. Wifey didn't have a good experience. her salad was under dressed, plus done with cheap iceburg lettuce..ickey. And they forgot the aioli with the crispy onions, which they desperately needed. they also left off the avocado on her salad. All in all I'll be  back for sure to eat the peking duck tacos and try a few others out.
