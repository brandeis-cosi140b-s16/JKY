Super cool spot! You feel like you are somewhere else and not Phoenix! Tacos were very delicious, the BBQ pork was our favorite followed by the fish taco. The veggie taco was our least favorite. We also got the corn in the cob and it was also great. The salsa that comes with the chips is very very good! Will be back real soon for sure!
