My friends love this place but I don't get the hype. I do enjoy the chips and salsa variety with cheap margaritas on happy hour. However, all of their food is very pricey and quantity just isn't there. I have tried the taco plate and the meat consistency reminds me of dog food. The church presence creeps me out and the chairs are kinda uncomfortable.
