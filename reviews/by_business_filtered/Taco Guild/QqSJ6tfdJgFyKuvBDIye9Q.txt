Came here for lunch because so many people have suggested Taco Guild. I definitely give the ambiance 5 stars - this place is a remodeled church and it's really cool inside. I also give the service 5 star. Sat at the bar and the service we received was exceptional.

As far as the food - it was a bit mediocre to me. The tacos are upscale and depending on what kind you get, between $3 and $5 a taco. If you get three, you get a free side. For being this expensive, I figured there would be more flavor with the tacos. I've had much better at hold in the wall places to be honest. 

The chips and guac were perfect though - I had that for the starter. Plus the salsa is very good as well. I'd give it a try if you're interested in checking it out - I'd probably go back for happy hour sometime.
