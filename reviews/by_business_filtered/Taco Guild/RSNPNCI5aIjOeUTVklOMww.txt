I met soon to be daughter-in-law here :) 
We had 3 tacos lettuce cups
MOLIDA LAMB  Creole a√Øoli, Bleu cheese, sweet potato hay
PORK ADOVADA mango jicama relish, avocado, cilantro.
PEKING DUCK plum sauce, fire roasted poblano apricot compote, Brie cheese
i think my favorite was the pork adovada, but all of them had so much flavor it was like taking a trip to favah town!
Chloe also had the Street Corn, she said she thought that was the best!
Great service, beautiful atmosphere, most interesting taco combinations, thank you for opening my taste-buds to new and exciting  flavors 
Will defiantly be back.
