I loved Taco Guild! I had not heard of it and some friends wanted to go. My first reaction, honestly, was "how great can ANOTHER taco place be in PHX?!". I was very pleasantly surprised! From the get go, super yummy chips and salsa and margaritas. The taco selections are range from unique to the expected. Their beef tacos were amazing and a definite recommendation. I also totally recommend their side rice. I will definitely be going back and not hesitating to tell others to check it out. :)
