What a wonderful concept. To be fair, my significant other's family attended the location when it was a church, so it made it even cooler. When you walk in, they have the place somewhat gutted with the exception of some of the pews left as aisles. 

Now, in our case, we went with a party of 10 and our server was new, so we had a few rough spots. One being, we ordered drinks that were missing, and food that didn't get put in. 

However, the food was phenomenal. I had the steak tacos and I could have eaten 1394723 more. We also got drinks, We had mescal mules and they were also great. Not to mention, the manager/owner came over and had us try some $1300 tequila, told us all the history of it, etc. and there was live music that was REALLY good!

I would definitely recommend this place to smaller parties, or dates. It is worth the price and they have done a great job.
