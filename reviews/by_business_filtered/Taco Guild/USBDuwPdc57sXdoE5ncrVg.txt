Almost thought we weren't going to stay because our first impression was how unfriendly they came across but that changed quickly. Our waitress first seemed rude but was not that way at all once we decided to stay.  After the first impression,  everything was up from there.  The happy hour Margarita was great,  the shrimp and daily taco was ok, and the Tres Leches was incredible.  The waitress recommended the steak and blue cheese taco which is worth coming back for by itself. The old church atmosphere was icing on the cake.  Definitely recommend.
