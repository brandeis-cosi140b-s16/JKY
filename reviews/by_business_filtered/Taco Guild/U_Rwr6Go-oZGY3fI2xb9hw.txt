This was another restaurant that I really wanted to like. The wait for the table wasn't a big deal at all, it was a Friday night at 7 - needless to say, we knew what we were getting in to. But the hour wait after that to get food was awful...  especially when you are only getting a couple of tacos. Very tiny tacos at that. Then it took and another 30 min to get the check and pay our bill - no bueno Between our small party, we had duck, snapper, shrimp, steak, lamb and chicken tacos. All were 'meh', nothing to come back for. My friend said the lamb was good, but not something going out of his way for. The specialty drinks were equally unimpressive, and the very average house margarita was still ten bucks. Just for me, 3 tacos and 2 drinks was 37 bucks, for food that was tiny and nothing special to boot! 

The design of the building was very cool, well done ambiance (but some really douchey people congregating at the bar who wouldn't move out of the isle as I am trying to walk by with my 4 month old sleeping baby.)

The tequila list looked impressive, but I am not going to spend $200 on a single shot of tequila. Again, everything was in place for a cool dining experience - then the food and service got in the way. (Although either the manager or owner who sat us was very kind and accommodating)
