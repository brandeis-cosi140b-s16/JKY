OMG! One word, totally delicious!  Oh, wait, two words, fantastic! Ok, three words then, totally delicious and fantastic!  Technically four words but "and" doesn't really count. The pork tacos are wonderful. I had the beef enchaladas. Full of flavor and reminded me of New Mexico cooking. The wait staff was very polite and attentive. The salsas are full bodied and full of flavor, not stupid hot so you can enjoy the food. They aren't afraid of special orders either.  Next time we're in town,  we'll be stopping by again.
