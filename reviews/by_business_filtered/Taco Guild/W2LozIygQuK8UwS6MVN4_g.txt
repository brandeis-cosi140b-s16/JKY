I am a big fan of street tacos so I was happy to give this place a try.  By far the most expensive street tacos I've ever seen or tasted.  They are good but $4-$5 each is crazy for a 3" taco.  The ingredients are good.  I wasn't blown away by the thai inspired taco but the al pastor was great.    

The best chips and salsa I have ever tasted in a restaurant.  I would score the place lower if it wasn't for the awesome chips and salsa.  Everything is made in house and it was awesome.  The decor is very nice and the service was excellent.
