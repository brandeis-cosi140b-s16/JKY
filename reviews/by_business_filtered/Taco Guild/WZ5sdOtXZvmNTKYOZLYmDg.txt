I've been wanting to check this place or for a while,  so a friend and i went for dinner after work.  The tacos are so  creative,  all of them tasty and delicious in their own way. You just have to see for yourself which ones soak to you and your tummy.  The service was AMAZING.when i say amazing i mean I've never had better service,  attentive,  nice but unpretentious.  They even have us chips and salsa to go!
