So so so good. The church is beautiful, the food is incredible and the wait staff are super knowledgable and fast! My Aunt and I had Kelton, he was so nice, gave great recommendations and knew so much about the place! Felt like we were guests in someone home for real! He recommended the Chipotle Cherry Steak tacos they the BOMB.COM I will def be coming back, thanks Kel!
