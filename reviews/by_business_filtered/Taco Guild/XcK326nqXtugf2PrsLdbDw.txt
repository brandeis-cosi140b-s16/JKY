I want to like this place more than I do. The atmosphere is amazing. The old church setting is unique, the servers are friendly, and the overall place is well kept. The food itself is par, but nothing I would drive out of the way to have. The portions are small so prices are higher simply because you have to buy more to fill up. I did enjoy the unique types of tacos, but the tortillas themselves sometimes ruined them for me (they default to corn tortillas if you don't specify and they don't always ask which you prefer). I have been here 3 times and will go again if a large group decides to go out, but I won't return just to grab food for myself or be the one to suggest going.
