First of all...the place is absolutely beautiful! My husband and I have been here a few times to enjoy cocktails at the bar but never ate there until yesterday and I have to say it was DELICIOUS! Our server, John who is amazing by the way, brought us chips and salsa for starters while we browsed the menu. They have 4 different types of salsa, each are wonderful but I think the green one was my favorite, and the chips are warm and fresh.  My husband ordered the tacos, which you can mix and match, I got  the chicken burrito, and for our little one, they made a cheese quesadilla. Both plates were mind blowing good and even our daughters was tasty. If you are looking for a new place to try in Central Phoenix, give this place a go! Cannot wait to go back!
