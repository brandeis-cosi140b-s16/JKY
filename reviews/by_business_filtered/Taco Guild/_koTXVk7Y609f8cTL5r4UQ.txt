Probably the best reuse of an existing space since the Parlor or even St. Francis. I applaud their attempt to introduce the taco to bold new flavors but none of them really resonated.  The craftsmen back in the kitchen should probably focus less on trying to come up with trendy and creative new combinations and focus on simpler arrangements that don't muddy up the palate.
