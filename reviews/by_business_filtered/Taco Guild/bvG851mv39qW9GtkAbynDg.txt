Nice addition to the neighborhood.  Walked in on a Wednesday at 5pm and was seated immediately.  Fantastic job turning this old church building into a beautiful restaurant.  I like how they kept the stained glass.  Our service, although very nice, was bumpy.  

We ordered the soup of the day which we were told was tortilla but not what we got.  No big deal as what was served was terrific.  Not sure what it was exactly but it had ground beef and fresh veg.  We then ordered our dinner, the duck tacos were delicious as were the shrimp tacos.  We also ordered a side of corn that never arrived.  We let the food runner know we were missing the side but he did not seem to really care.  He said it would be along shortly but never came.  

If you get a chance, ask for the Tequila Book.  The book (menu) contains a huge list of pages of different kinds of Tequila they offer.  I did not bring my reading glasses so at first I was sure I did not read the menu correctly as I saw shots of tequila for $500... what???  I asked my dinner partner if that was five dollars and he assured me it was indeed $500.  

If your bank account does not allow for five hundred dollar shots, be advised they do have a great happy hour where you can get a draft beer  and shot of Tequila for five dollars.  (pretty sure it is not the five hundred dollar shot) 

They might have dessert but did not see any on the menu and we were not offered any.
