The meal was amazing! The service was outstanding. We started off the meal with chips and house guac which tastes a step above most places! My fianc√© is doesn't eat red meat and had the vegetarian and shrimp tacos which were delightful. I had the staples: chicken, carne Asada, and pork. Each one tasted different and unique.  My favorite of them all was the chicken surprising, not because it tasted the best, but because the favors complemented each other well.

We had two beers for the table and didn't touch one of them because of good conversation. When the server came around they asked if we didn't like the beer and we said no, and explained about the conversation. The server insisted he take it off the bill and that was that. Highly recommended for service and food!
