An old church, which has now been turned into a Taco and Tequila joint? I'm in! It was beautiful inside with a full bar and plenty of original church pew seating. The murals and stained glass windows with dim lighting gave it an authentic feel. They give you 4 different salsa dips to try with tortilla chips, which we all loved. The tacos were filling and a great choice (shrimp, fish, and beef) The corn was definitely one of my favorites and was cooked perfectly and spicy but not overwhelming. The queso dip was excellent and I honestly have never had better. We also had spicy meatballs that were good, but to spicy for me but my friends loved them. The happy hour menu was quite small with very little appeal to us, therefore we won't be coming for Happy Hour. Over all we were pleased.
