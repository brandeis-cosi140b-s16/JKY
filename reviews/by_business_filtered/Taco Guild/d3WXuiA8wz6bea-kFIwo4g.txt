This restroom really left an impression on me. The single urinal affords privacy and time for reflection. Very clean, and the lack of a door keeps the lively noise from the restaurant going while you wash up.

And -- as I'm leaving -- I see portraits of dogs in military uniform lining the walls, the coup de gr√¢ce.
