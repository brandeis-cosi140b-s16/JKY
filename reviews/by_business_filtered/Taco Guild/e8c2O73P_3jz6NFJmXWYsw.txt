My motivator for this restaurant was that I wanted to see the inside. It is incredible and interesting and creative! The food was good too. My friends warned me it is a little pricey for the amount of food. I was strategic. You get free chips and salsa which are delicious. I had the happy hour tacos which were well worth it and delicious. I also like the uniqueness of the plates and how they don't match.
