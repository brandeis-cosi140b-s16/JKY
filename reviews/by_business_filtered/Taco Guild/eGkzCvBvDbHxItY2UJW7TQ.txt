Ambiance is pretty cool.  And the food is pretty good.  I mean, you don't walk out thinking "holy s*** that's the best taco I've ever had", but it's still quite good.  Salsa and sauces are nicely done and the drinks are top notch.  They have a great little selection of "gourmet" tacos.  Check it out!
