Food was really delicious. Had the taco and side combo. Had the Al Pastor and Braised beef. Corn for the side. The pastor is definitely the best, and from opinion of my other 10 coworkers, it was amazing. The corn was extremely delicious. I wish i had more but overall satisfied. It can be pricey but its worth it. Its definitely a cool concept and environment. I will definitely be back.
