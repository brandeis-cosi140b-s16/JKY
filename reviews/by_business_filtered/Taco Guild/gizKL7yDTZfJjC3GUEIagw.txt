What a killer joint!!!! The place was a visual piece of art, open and bustling with the ever evolving mid town vibe. I would have to say that the music was loud..and I had to holler at our friends...but maybe next time go during the week when live music isnt playing. The tacos and duo queso/guacamole are my recommendations! But my husband was smiling ear to ear over the enchiladas....its five star according to me!! Valet parking and excellent service !!
