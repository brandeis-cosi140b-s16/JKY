Enviorment: amazing decor, love it!
Service: decent, nothing to complain or rave about
Food: chips and salsa were amazing but the meatballs, our tacos and rice were bland...nothing to write home about. Margaritta was way to strong...it was like taking a shot of tequila, some people may like that but I don't like the taste of liquor at all.
Price: $40.77 before tip

Overall: glad I tried it, but would be okay never coming back. But because I'm on the border of good and bad I would be willing to give them another chance...just no time soon  and only if I'm not paying :)
