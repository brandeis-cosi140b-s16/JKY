This is a great find! In an old church which the property dates back to the 1880's, the current church building was constructed in the 1940's. Exposed wood beams, original stained glass, eclectic decor, including enlarged copies of Rembrandt's on the upper walls. The huge bar takes the place of the old altar complete with 2 60" tv's that almost appear to be floating above the massive back bar. They squeeze a lot of fresh fruit for their cocktails. I had the Blushing Seniorita.. It was so good I ordered a second;) it's a berry sangria. My husband had 2 craft beers. The tacos are street tacos, so they're small but packed full of flavor! I tried the coffee beef, Peking duck, and shrimp tacos with a side of onion straws. The Peking duck was my fave. My husband had the coffee beef, the chicken, and the al pastor. He enjoyed the coffee beef the best. His side was the corn off the cob and he said it was really good. History+good drinks+good food+ atmosphere= cool place ya gotta check out!!! The service at first was a little slow, but the place was packed. We were seated immediately, but it took a bit to order and get our meal. To be expected when its a new place and the place is packed. I know we'll be back again:)
