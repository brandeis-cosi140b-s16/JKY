First timer to the Taco Guild drove by it a couple of times and just decided to do lunch there with my co-worker since we work 5 mins away!...First off it's a remodel of an old church..SO DOPE! the layout is very cool! Hostess was super nice and server I believe her name was Laynie was very good! I had the Taco Plate your choice of three tacos on the menu (there are 10 choices) for me it was the Al Pastor Pork-BOMB, Chipotle Cherry Steak-Very Good, and Urban Bean Coffee Braised Beef- Good and you get a side, I picked Green Chile Achiote Rice which was really good too!. Will absolutely go back for dinner soon
