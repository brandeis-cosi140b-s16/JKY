I am in love!  Since the moment I walk in everyone has been courteous, genuine and just awesome!  The bartender showed us to a table, there has been at least 4 servers that have helped us and the food, oh Lordy help me, the food is drool worthy!  The chips, which are complimentary, are the best I have had in a long time.  The salsa is not a great ball of fire which is good on my book.  The guacamole we tried was the one with pineapple and mint. Mmmmm! Mmmm good!  We did want the one with bacon and they were out but whatever, we were happy campers.  The tacos we had were out of this world!  The Thai snapper snapped me back to my honeymoon in Thailand only last month.  I swooned and was transported back to the most romantic trip I ever took.  We also had the Peking duck taco with apricot compote, it got my taste buds ready for the holidays.  Michael was our main server and he was so personable and well versed on the menu, such a plus since they have only been open 3 days!  There is a jukebox so you can pick music and the frescos are custom made and have "The Masters" seriously check them out.
