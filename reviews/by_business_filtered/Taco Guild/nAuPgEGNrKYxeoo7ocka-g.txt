It was a Friday night and my husband and I had tickets to a DBacks game so naturally the question was, where to eat? I'd much rather spend $40 at a nice restaurant than on a hotdog! I'd been to Taco Guild before for lunch and had been itching to return with husband in tow, but we are never on that side of town. I texted my husband to let him know I had a surprise for dinner! Little did I know, it was also National Tequila Day (how I didn't know this, I'm not sure as Tequila is often my drink of choice). We arrived at Taco Guild to find there was no room to park and an hour wait, but I reassured him it was well worth it. We passed our time listening to Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers while sipping on free samples of his Mexican Moonshine Tequila. Once seated, we accompanied our margaritas with chips, salsa and chorizo meatballs! My husband ordered the Tequila Day special--three tacos and a margarita for $7.24--and I ordered two tacos wrapped in lettuce, which trust me, does not sacrifice any flavor. Together the architecture, food, drinks, service and overall atmosphere make for a perfect night in North Phoenix! We will return to Taco Guild again and again!
