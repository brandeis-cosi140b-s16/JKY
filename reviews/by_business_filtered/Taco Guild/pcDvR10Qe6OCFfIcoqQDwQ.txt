Today was my first time at Taco Guild and I found the entire visit to be very disappointing and the entire reason was because of the level of service I was provided. 

As a person with food allergies (dairy, gluten and corn) I try to be as straightforward and responsible about my understanding of a menu as possible before visiting a restaurant. That way I can arrive with some ideas for what I will eat and ask some clarifying questions/inform the server of my needs to ensure that what I am ordering is something I can eat. This is so I do not haw to send something back or take too much time making a decision, which is what I did today. 

I ordered three tacos all without cheese and in lettuce wraps rather than tortillas after explaining my food allergies to the waitress. We cut the cheese and and were good to go... So I thought. 

When my food arrived, my two beef tacos had breaded and fried green chiles (not gluten free) on them. The menu simply says green chile strips and the waitress failed to inform me they were breaded and fried. Well, alright, I'll pull them off. No one is perfect and my food allergies make things a little difficult. Then, under all that is meat that is covered in a cream based sauce... Great. Well, I guess I'll just move on to the other taco. 

I took a bite of the Peking Duck taco and bit into a 3 inch bone that was shaped and was as sharp as a toothpick. I should have taken a picture. I was so frustrated. So I finally waived the waitress offer. She said, "Oh, well that happens sometimes. I can call my manager but she's just going to tell you the same thing." Which she did. Are you kidding me? That is the answer you give a customer? I was done after that. They comped one taco and I paid $19 to go home hungry and eat leftovers. Oh, they also gave me a $5 coupon for my next visit. Well, that was a waste of paper because I will not be returning.
