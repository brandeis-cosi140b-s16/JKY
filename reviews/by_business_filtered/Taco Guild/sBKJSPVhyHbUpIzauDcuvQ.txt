Be you sinner or saint, Taco Guild is a place to pay penance and make peace with all manner of spirits and eucharist. Their tacos and other sides take your palette to heaven on earth. If I was a "sister", I'd make a "habit" of coming to this taco sanctuary. 

The place is jumping and popular. Great location and well executed on the use of the church, makes the artisan guild concept really work. The "duo guild starter" is great for a party of three or four to start. Pray that you get sat in kutie-Kyle's section. This guy is heaven sent: sweet, sincere, efficient, and charming to boot. Take him up on the jalape√±o bacon in the guacamole - delicious!

It's a loud place, has a juke box, and the acoustics of a church. So if you're old, lame, or kind of a "stick in the mud", probably not your scene. The night I went it was swarming with couples from the Biltmore and Arcadia area, followed by Melrose gayberhood crews and Roosevelt Hipsters came about 7ish - fun scene if you don't take yourself or religion too seriously.
