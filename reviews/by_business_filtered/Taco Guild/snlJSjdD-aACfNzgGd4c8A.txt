I was brought here by a friend, I was reluctant because I wasnt totally in the mood for mexican.  Boy am I glad they did.  

Walk in the large beautiful front door and you walk into a very large room with the bar at the front to worship.  We choose to sit at the bar.  Chips and salsa were pretty good, on par with what you would expect from a mexican joint.  

Coctail... I ordered the Gentlemans Agreement, this is a solid drink.  I cant recall exactly what was in it but I can remember being skeptical on how smooth it would be.  I was very pleased.  

For the tacos.... hands down the best taco I have eaten was the chipolte steak taco...  I will be back just for these bad boys.  

The ambiance was enjoyable, they had a live band that started playing as we were leaving, heard one song and they were pretty good.  Wish we could have stayed longer but had to leave.... 

Bottom line, if you go here on a Saturday night and have a few too many drinks and sleep in late on sunday, dont worry, you were already at church last night.
