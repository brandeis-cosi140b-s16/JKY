Mimosas are delicious here! Bloody Mary was spicy and tasty. They start you off with, you get complimentary chips and four types of salsas. 

The pineapple mint guacamole was a great start to our meals. Sweet and perfectly seasoned, topped with caramelized pineapple. 

All together we tried the duck, shrimp, lamb, and thai curry tacos. My favorite, hands down was the duck, it's topped with roasted peaches that compliment the juicy shredded meat just perfectly! Second was the shrimp, flavorful and the sauces it came with with chosen just right for this one. The lamb was overpowered by the tartness of the blue cheese, and the sweet potato hay made it too dry, decent at best. Coconut thai curry was also one we could have left behind, bland and simple. 

The interior was pretty cool, and staff was friendly. Definitely recommend!
