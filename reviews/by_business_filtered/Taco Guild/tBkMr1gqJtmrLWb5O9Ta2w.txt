The building is definitely different for a restaurant. We went on a Friday at lunchtime and it was packed, had to wait about 15-20 minutes. Enjoyed the chips and different salsa's provided. Tried the Chipotle Cherry Steak taco and the Al Pastor Pork taco, both were tasty and satisfying (which made me overlook the price for a "street taco").
Side note: the restaurant shares a small parking lot with a coffee house and a retail store, so be prepared to park along the street and walk.
