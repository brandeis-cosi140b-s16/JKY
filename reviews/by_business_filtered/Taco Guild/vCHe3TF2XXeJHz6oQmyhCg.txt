Clearly, you come to Taco Guild for the atmosphere. Which is great. The tacos are expensive and sound better than they taste. The use of local ingredients earned this place its 3rd star.

The Happy Hour specials are reasonable and the orientation of long, group-style seating and dim lighting make it a good spot for that.
