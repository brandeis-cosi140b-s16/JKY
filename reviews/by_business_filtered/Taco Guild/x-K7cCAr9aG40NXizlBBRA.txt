I recently moved into the area a couple months ago, and decided to try Taco Guild because it looked like neat place on the outside.

Once inside, I was very impressed with the decor.  It is an old converted church with neat stained glass windows and dark, rich wood accents everywhere, very spacious and clean.

The food is amazing.  All ingredients locally sourced and fresh, fresh, fresh.  The tacos are unbelievable and the burritos and street corn are also fabulous.

One thing that has set this place apart in my book-the friendliness of the staff.  From the bartenders to the servers and everyone in between.....these folks smile and talk to you and genuinely care about how your experience there is.

Only thing keeping this from being a five-star affair is that it is a just a tad  pricey (not way pricey, just a bit in my opinion), but I also 'get' that at most places, good, quality food is usually worth the extra cost. Taco Guild is definitely a winner.
