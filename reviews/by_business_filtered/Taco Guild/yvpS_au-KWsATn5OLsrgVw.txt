My husband and I went to dinner at Taco Guild tonight in spite of the rating I had seen on Yelp. To start off, I would recommend going here...

Saying that, I would advise that it is more of an artisanal taco restaurant, not abuelitas mexican cuisine. I ordered an Al Pastor and a Pork Adovada taco in the lettuce wraps. They were both wonderful!! 
My husband ordered the chicken taco and a cherry steak/beef taco (I forget what it was called), and neither of them were fabulous.. The chicken was very bland, and neither taco was seasoned quite right and did not have enough meat in them. He tried both of my tacos, and loved them both. We will both stick to al pastor and pork next time we visit.

We both enjoyed the chips and salsa, as well as the chorizo meatballs as an appetizer. Spicey!! But really good :).

The ambiance inside is nice. Bad music choices, (we both like country but not particularly in a historic church over tacos...), but they have put a lot of effort in making the place unique.

We both LOVED our waitress, and felt the service was great. I am rating 5 stars now because I think this place deserves higher than 3.5 stars... Previous reviews tear the service apart but we have to be understanding of new restaurants--they don't get to choose the country's top 50 servers and hire them for their grand opening. 

This place offer tacos in butter lettuce wraps...you don't find that often!! And they were so good, my husband (who is no tiny twig) is going to order them my way next time and pass up the corn tortillas. 

We will be back, and I'll cross my fingers my hubby gets meatier tacos in subsequent visits. It's worth a shot.
