Food was great. Ambiance was just the right amount of steam punk. I had the pork belly tacos and the cured meat melted in my mouth. The ahi ceviche was perfect. Being a huge raw foods fan I was very pleased. My girlfriend and I also tried the tres leches cake and it taste so good make ya wanna smack ya momma.
