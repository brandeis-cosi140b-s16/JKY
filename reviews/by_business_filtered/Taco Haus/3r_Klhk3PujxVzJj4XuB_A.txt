Seriously disappointing. .. service was bad, food was HORRIBLE!! we ordered the carne asada, pork belly, and chicken tacos. The chicken appeared to be boiled, watery, and tasteless. The carne asada was overcooked and chewy. the pork belly was just okay. We also ordered the chicken nachos which were disgusting- oily and topped with that boiled chicken again. The food was seriously disappointing. .. I've had better Mexican food at Zipps. This is my first and only review, ever. Yup, that's how bad it was..

 EDIT- I just noticed that there is 28 reviews that are not "recommended" for his place. Do yourself a favor and READ THEM!! I'm not sure why Yelp does not recommended them because they are spot on with my experience! Thanks Yelp, you should pay me back the $80 I just spent at this dump.
