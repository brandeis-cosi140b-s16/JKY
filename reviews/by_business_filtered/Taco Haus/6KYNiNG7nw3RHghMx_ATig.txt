Ordered al pastor pork loin. It was undercooked  and raw. Then brought back and was overcooked and could only taste char burnt pork. Plate was $24 and was not worth it. La frontera street truck and la LOMITA street truck have better street tacos . Three stars is for the service. At least the cook came out and said sorry for undercooked meat, but said he didn't cook it he was in a meeting.
