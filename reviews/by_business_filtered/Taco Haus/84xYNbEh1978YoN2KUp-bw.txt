I don't know why anyone would put so much money and attention into creating such a nice atmosphere and then have tasteless food.  A very nice patio and attractive interior.  
We had the pork belly tacos - dry and tasteless, the carne asada tacos - just plain tasteless, and the short ribs tacos - how can you possibly have no flavor with a sriracha sauce, but they didn't.  The rice had no seasoning and the lentils???  Lentils, really???  The queso fundido was runny and greasy and a very skimpy portion.  The strawberry margarita tasted like strawberry syrup.  Very disappointing.
I'm giving them 2 stars because our waiter was very nice and attentive.  It is totally overprices for what they are serving.
