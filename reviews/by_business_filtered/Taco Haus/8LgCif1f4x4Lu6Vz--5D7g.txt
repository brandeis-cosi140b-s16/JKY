This latest attempt to open a trendy restaurant near Scottsdale Road and Shea appears to be an early failure; so disappointing because we need more quality eateries around here.
The pork belly taco was way too dry and quite cold by the time it arrived. The carne asada taco was the best thing I ate here, but it was mediocre compared more authentic Mexican fare (e.g. Haba√±eros). For non-authentic (gringo) tacos, the beef shoulder taco at Salty Sow is far superior.
The halibut ceviche was extremely bland, nearly awful, and at $12, a ripoff as well. There were only a very few pieces of inadequately marinated and under-seasoned halibut. I could taste the lime, but the dish lacked salt, cilantro and had virtually no chile flavor. I travel down the Baja coast regularly for work and I know what halibut ceviche can be, this place does not have it. The fish was borderline not-fresh (per my nose). The dish included an inordinate amount of vegetables, presumably to make up for the lack of halibut. The chef used (far too many) raw-ish kernels of yellow corn, which were extremely starchy (well out of season!) and made the whole dish very unpleasant to eat. I SO wanted to like the ceviche, but I simply could not finish it.
The best thing I tasted here were the home made corn tortillas that came with the tacos. I found them to be quite excellent.
All told, I spent $40 on dinner for one (including one draft beer which was not cold enough) and left hungry. This place just opened this week. Against my better judgement, I will give it one more try.
