Love was in the air...
It was Valentines Day and we had a babysitter (thanks again, Mom!)

Instead of fighting the crowds and hitting up a fancy schmancy restaurant, I suggested Taco Haus, and I'm so glad I did.  

I love the casual atmosphere and the food was out of this world delicious.  Seriously - some of the freshest, tastiest food I've had in quite some time.  It was so good in fact, that I'm rounding up my rating to five stars despite a couple of hiccups with the service that evening.  That and hey - love was in the air!

We ordered a ton of food because the entire menu sounded great... it was hard to choose.  Our feast included:

*the scallop, shrimp, and ahi ceviche - scallop was our favorite but all were great
*the jicama salad (which we learned was the original menu item that Chef Payton created to go with this concept)
*beef tataki
*chips and guac
*roasted peppers - beware - they have a kick!
*side of veggies
*flan
*tres leches

We did a good job demolishing the majority of the meal, but we did take home leftovers, and they were just as good the next day!

Moderate prices considering the food quality, friendly service (even if they are working through the kinks at the moment), and a Valentines Day to remember.  I can't wait for my next visit!
