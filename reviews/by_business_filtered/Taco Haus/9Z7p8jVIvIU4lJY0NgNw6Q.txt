Lentils?  Really???

People who eat Mexican food have been known on occasion to enjoy beans, be they refried or black, but never a lentil.

Though having tried a number of other dishes at Taco Haus, I believe the choice of lentils and bland white rice as accoutrements was so that the other food would not be overpowered by flavorful sides.

Also strange was the need to ask for salsa, which then arrived straight from the Pace jar, in a small to go plastic cup, which really enhanced the upscale casual dining experience.

It isn't the location that will eventually kill this place, it is the odd choices that lead o a clunky execution.
