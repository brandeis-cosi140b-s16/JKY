Came to check things out...pretty disappointing...had fish tacos and rice..fried fish was decent but the grilled was gross and the rice was awful..Service and decor were nice but way too expensive for what you get..my friend had a salad that he disliked. Hope they get things dialed in because the concept is good. The execution is not..
