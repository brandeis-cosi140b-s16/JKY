Naming the place Taco Haus prepared my palette for a taco experience. Especially since it replaced Blue Burrito.  But that's not what I had. It's almost like the chef wants to be a clever alchemist but fails. Tom Jetland he is not.

I had two tacos. One chicken. One carne asade. The chicken one had no flavor except I could taste the corn tortilla.. The steak one tasted like the steak had been marinated in Worcestershire sauce, which was unpleasant. I dressed them both up with guacamole and salsa (I had to ask for and they were extra). I hated the lunch.

The place looks like it would be a great happy hour--inside has picnic table style seating, built to be lined up with butts from the frat house on Saturday night. There's a lot of seating outside too, which would be a fun happy hour.

Service was slow, although there seemed to be a lot of servers. My friend and I paid $30 for our lunch, left and went to McDonalds to get ice cream cones to cleanse our palettes from a lunch we are trying to forget. He had ceviche, by the way, and was more than underwhelmed.

I am happy to read that some of these reviews of Taco Haus are so glowing. Maybe I caught them on an off day but somehow, I don't think so. I am a total foodie and this is one place I would not recommend.

But what I will recommend to Taco Haus:  write a little blurb about your style and philosophy on the menus so customers understand they're not getting a taco that their palette might be craving.

I'll give them two stars because it appears they have a wide selection of tequilas. After enough tequila, anything tastes good, right?
