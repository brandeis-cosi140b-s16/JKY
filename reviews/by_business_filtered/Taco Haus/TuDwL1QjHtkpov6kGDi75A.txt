When Restaurant Week hits twice a year....it can be greeted by regulars staying away in droves because they can go to places that they enjoy without the 100 dB atmosphere and the glazed look in people's eyes OR newbies can try out new places that they have wanted to try without spending the full price of a dinner and have a nice sampling of the product. Tonight, Peg and I went to one of the places that we have enjoyed and experienced a great combo of avoiding the the craziness but with the wonderful sampling of goodies...at the Taco Haus.  Oh yeah...and this was Taco Tuesday at the Haus in addition to RW. .Payton et al  and his wonderful front staff (Colleen comes to mind) managed to bring the flavor and the outside patio area produced the atmosphere. The choices for the $40/couple were outstanding, fresh, flavorful, and it seemed like we were the only ones in the place. Shrimp cerviche, excellent guac and ships (with fresh red and green salsa), chicken and carne asada tacos....and Tres Leche cake which was still as good as it was the first time we tried it. Tony was our server and did an outstanding job. Roughly three zillion Go-Daddy employees might differ with the we-were-the-only-ones-there idea. They appeared to having a terrific time and  we loved the quietness of the patio with misters misting. If you haven't checked this place out...it is worth whatever week it is!
