When I am running around at 3:00 am with AK blazing and two 40s strapped to my head while I suck' em down, I think there is nothing better than tacos from a drive thru. Imagine my delight when I read about a new Taco place that has a carry out window!

THen imagine one of the best meals that you can have with the freshest ingredients put together by one of the most creative Chefs in the valley, Payton Curry. With Dave Andrea at his side, the concept reallyyy works. Peg and I went last night to the first official night of service. We tried several ceviches (scallop, shrimp, and ahi) and could literally taste each ingredient. The freshness was amazing. We had three tacos (pork belly, carne asada, and chicken) and I was thankfully not transported back to the bag o'tacos that I have had in the past.  Because I always look for what I call "cool and creamy" at the end of a meal with wonderful spices, we tried the Tres Leches cake that was made in house by Shantal. 

This is a definite must...and a very cool addition to your list of special places!
