Understaffed. I like the vibe of this place. They did a great job on the former Blue Burrito location. The bar is really cool, however seating is very close together there. We sat at a high top next to the bar. We got seated immediately but had to wait so long for a waitress that we almost left. She came and we ordered. Chips and guacamole came out right away but no drinks, no waitress. She was very nice but they are completely understaffed. She was inside, outside and all over the place. The table next to us on their way to the movies was getting very frustrated. After we finally got our  drinks we didn't see her again for quite a while. 

I want to give it one more try as I really want to like it, but they need more staff.
