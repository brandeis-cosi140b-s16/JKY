New place in Scottsdale!  We had the Chef's Table and of course, the Chef himself came by, introduced himself and gave us the jicama salad and the kale salad on the house!  Both salads were nice and light, great dressing.  Love the portions, small and affordable.  I had the chicken taco and it was very nice and light and tasty.  I also had the pork belly taco (probably not good for you) but it was delicious!  Crunchy and fatty and very flavorful!  I had rice and lentil and this is the first time I had Mexican food without feeling bloated after.  They make fresh tortillas here, lots of vegetarian and gluten free choices, therefore lots of healthier choices!  The only thing I didn't like here was the amount of noise, very loud.  Perhaps there is no need to have the background music on too high...  Overall, it's a must try!
