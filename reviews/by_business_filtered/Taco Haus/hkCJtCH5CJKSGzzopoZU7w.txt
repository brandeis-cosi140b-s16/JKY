Overall rating- good, not great, just average.

Margaritas were smooth, light on the salt for the rim.

We had the tacos, shrimp, al pasador and short rib are yummy!! The strEAT corn, delicious!  However the pork belly taco... Overcooked to the point my fianc√© and I thought it was diced potatoes (looked and tasted like it)! Waitress thought that is how pork belly was suppose to be..

Price for the food we thought was a tad high for what it was.. Similar price to Cien Agave, just not quite there.

I'm glad I tried it, if I come back I'm not sure if I would adventure outside of what I had.
