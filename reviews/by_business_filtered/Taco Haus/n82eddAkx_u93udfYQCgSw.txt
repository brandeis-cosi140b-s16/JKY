This place opened 1/21/14 been watching them construct the place, was excited to go there.........it SUCKS!!!! Fox10 news lied big when the had these people on to promote, they should be a shamed of them selves to tell people to go there  when they tasted the horrible food. All my dishes (which is a la cart) tasted like fish, inside smelled like fish. So I sat outside. I has a chicken taco, pork taco, both had no flavor and they give it to you in 1 tortilla.....hello street tacos come double stacked, had the Columbian rice, is was crunchy jasmine rice with lemon squeezed on top, the salsa was bad also had no flavor either. Nothing had flavor. My friend had the fish taco and said it was nasty. They give you a 40.oz empty bottle of beer filled with water (tap I'm sure). And the service sucked, waiter asked if we wanted our checks and forgot. The lunch crowd was gone. I had to get up and going inside and tell the guy "did you forget us". I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!! Lucky I gave them 1 star, guess I had 2 eat it, pissed I did and paid for it.
