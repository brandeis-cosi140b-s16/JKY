I really hope you review your reviews, taco haus staff, because each time we have been here, it's been pretty empty...

The food is good, but the menu is missing an affordable taco experience.  It's the Taco Haus, and the tacos are overpriced.  For me, everything else is workable, and we would come back if we felt like we could get a couple cold ones and wash them down with a few street tacos without ending up with a $60.00 tab.   Make margins on booze, beer, half chickens and specialties.    Just let me feel like I got a deal on a taco at happy hour.
