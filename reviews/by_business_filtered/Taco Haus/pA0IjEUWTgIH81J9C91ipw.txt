First time dining at taco haus. Was really excited because I love modern Mexican cuisine and the menu online really jumped out at me. I work in a restaurant and was excited to try the short rib tacos because I've had some killer ones in the past and the description made me feel like these would be no exception. I ordered the short rib tacos and a side of street corn along with a haus margarita. The margarita was on point and the street corn had unique twists that I haven't encountered in the dish before... Very delicious! However, the tacos themselves were really a let down. The meat was very dry like it had been sitting out rather than bathing in its own juices as any slow cooked meat should. However, with enough extra sriracha aioli to bathe it in I managed to get it down. What I couldn't get past was what was described as 'pickeled peppers' that came on the tacos were nothing more than sliced bell peppers period. As much as I love the decor, ambiance, service and of course the street corn. I hope they fix the execution of this taco. I'll definitely be back to try more
