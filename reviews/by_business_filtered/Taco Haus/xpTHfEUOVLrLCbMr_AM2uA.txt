I dropped in because it was new and in my neighborhood and called a few friends to join me. Our server was Sam and he was awesome. We had the peach ale to drink and a few appetizers. From the name it sounds german but the menu is a mix between southwest and mexian. My palette was confused by the name thinking we were going to have tacos and beer, but that is not at all the case. It's very nice and the ambiance is cool and I'm not saying the food was bad, it was just a surprise. I think it will do well in its location and it's a nice summer spot for sure.
