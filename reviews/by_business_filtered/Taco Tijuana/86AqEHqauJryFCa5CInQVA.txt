My wife and I stopped here for lunch on a whim before heading to the airport.  Man was I glad we did.  Super friendly staff and excellent food.  We tried several tacos, to include lengua, carne asada, and tripe, but their adobada was easily the best.  Great little place to try out right off the strip.
