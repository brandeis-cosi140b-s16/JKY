After looking for some good cheap home (L.A.) food in Vegas I came across this place. I was told that this place had the real other side of the border tacos and sure enough....they weren't lying! Hand made tortillas! Awesome guacamole! Just amazing Tijuana style tacos. While I'm from LA Im used to dollar tacos so $2 per taco was on the pricier side...BUT...I cannot complain! Well worth the price...but hey if your in Vegas might as well spend your money (that you will end up giving to the casinos) on some good tacos.
