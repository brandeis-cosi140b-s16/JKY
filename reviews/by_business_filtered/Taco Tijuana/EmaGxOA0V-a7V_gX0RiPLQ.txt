Good but really nothing special. I will go back. 6 bucks for 3 tacos is a good deal in my books. I got two asada tacos and 1 pastor. For the 1st time ever I think I liked the pastor more. The asada with everything on it might have had to much on it. Overall both flavors were good but nothing really stood out on this day. I will go again and update if it needs it.
