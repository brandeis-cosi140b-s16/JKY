I read the reviews on yelp on this place a lot of people seemed to of liked this place. First off the lady making my food wasn't wearing GLOVES i should of left right then and there absolutely ridiculous anyways ... I ordered the pastor and I did not like it I didn't even finish it. Ie never had pastor all I new was that it marinated meat I was expecting something awesome and I'll I got was the regular meat you get on the fries you order at tacos el Gordo . The cilantro on the pastor wa ridiculous , cilantro is way to over powering and really it was the cilantro that killed the pastor and the whole disappointment of the whole dish . I will not be returning and will not recommend this place to anyone . Sorry  but tacos el Gordo still has my win
