I stopped in for a quick bite , after seeing so many great reviews , I was having dinner a little later that evening , so it was just a quick snack to keep me tide over , I walked in and was greeted promptly by the cashier and kitchen staff , I ordered a quesidilla with adobada , and omg !! The meat was a perfect balance of crispy pieces and juicy tender perfectly marinaded chunks of pork bliss !! The quesidilla was made with slices of Mexican cheese and topped with a wonderful salsa that wasn't too spicy or weak ! It was also served with big chunks of grilled onions and a roasted chile !! Flavor wise it needed nothing !! The entire staff was very friendly , which goes a long way , not like taco y taco or la famosa Jose , both which are down the street & which I love their food but their service is spotty at best . There is a small salsa bar area , which looks like it has cut limes and marinated carrots / onions but no salsas that I seen ,but as I said it needed none !! I would frequent this place more if they had carnitas , which I didn't see on menu ?? But maybe they do have ?? The menu is mostly tacos , with many meat varieties , they do have burritos , nachos as well , but that is pretty much it I'm sure their tacos are the stars which I definetly will go back and try !!
