DELISH!!! Great tacos. Carne Asada and Al Pastor are delicious!!! They also serve the grilled onions and peppers. Everything is always fresh and the staff are super friendly. It's a perfect little taco joint. Once word of mouth spreads, this place will be BUSY!!! I prefer it to the popular chain Tacos El Gordo. The meat at Tacos Tijuana is tastier.
