I love this place. I can't drive passed it without stopping in now. 
The ordering system is a little weird, and there is a little bit of a language barrier, but honestly, that's kind of what I'm looking for in a Mexican restaurant. I need to try more of their menu, but so far, everything I've tried has been excellent.
I can't speak to it's authenticity because I'm a gringo from San Diego, but as far as that experience goes, Taco Tijuana is authentic to me.
