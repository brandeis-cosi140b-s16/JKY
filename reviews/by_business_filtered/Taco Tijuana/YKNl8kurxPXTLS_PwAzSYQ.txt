I feel like there was a disgruntled employee over at Tacos El Gordo who decided to leave and start his/her own taco shop modeled exactly after Tacos El Gordo. That new taco shop is what we now know as Taco Tijuana.
If you've been to Tacos El Gordo, I SWURR that everything tastes the same...
which is actually a great thing! Everything is the same great quality, and now I don't have to drive out of my way to get some bomb tacos. 
What does differentiate them from TEG is the fact that they will put their meat into any form of "Mexican Food"--burritos, quesadillas, etc., something that does not happen at TEG. 
$2 a taco may seem expensive for street tacos, but they pile the meat on there. You won't be disappointed!
They have a patio and have recently added on another room. More tacos for everyone! Wooooooo!
