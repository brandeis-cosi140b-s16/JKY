We have been trying to find a decent Mexican food place since we moved here about a month ago. I thought that this would be the one due to the consistent good reviews, however I thought wrong.

We kept it simple and ordered the Carne Asada Fries and a Carne Asada Quesadilla. The Carne Asada Fries were about 80% cheese and sour cream, which even when scraped off had almost no flavor. The Quesadilla was very odd to me. For some reason, the bottom of it was a flour tortilla, and on top of the somehow bitter meat was a tiny corn tortilla. I would hardly call that a quesadilla by any standards. We definitely will not be returning to this place since it is a waste of money.
