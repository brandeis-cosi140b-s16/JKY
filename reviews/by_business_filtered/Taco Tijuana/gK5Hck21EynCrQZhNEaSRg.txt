Aside from the sassy cashier, this place is A+ perfection.
You can order an assortment of burritos, soft tacos, fries, etc with any kind of toppings and meat. The chefs are quick and the food is great. I think the price is slightly higher than what they should be charging, but if I'm ever craving a kick ass burrito I might suck it up until i find someplace cheaper and just as good.
