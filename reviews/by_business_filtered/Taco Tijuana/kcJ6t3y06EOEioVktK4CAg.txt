This recently opened Mexican restaurant has received lots of love on the internet.  We ordered 4 adobada (marinated pork) street tacos that were finished with crema, cilantro, pineapple and a spicy red salsa.  The tacos were generously filled with thick slices of slightly fatty meat. It proved to be a more convenient alternative to our beloved Tacos el Gordo.
