Is it tasty?!? Is it scrumptious!?! Is it CRUNCHABLE!?! 

Score another point for the EASTCYDE Precious! 

So Mikey Elite tells me of a new taco joint on EASTCYDE Trop. I'll pho'ks with it. Turns out to be a brand new spot. Three weeks old and kill'n it. We are already looking at the marinated pork on the spit. The young lady immediately gives us a sample of the goods. Probably the most flavorful marinated pork I've had in Vegas and the most greaziest. I wish I had the appetite that day to eat a whole bunch, but I had eaten earlier. My great friend buys me three and they were devoured soon after. 

The place has a simple, but clean setup. A lot of Mexican street fare taco joints are popping up in the valley which is great for the taco head in you. Haha Mikey C!!! It's getting hot, so that brick and mortar and AC is looking very accommodating. Combo that with dem tacos and you got a happy customer. I think the only thing missing is that Orange Bang to set dem tacos off.

Great food! Great place! Great customer service! 
EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!
