Just yesterday i decide that taco tijuana was no longer the place it used to be 2yrs ago.It has become as chaotic as Tacos El Gordo.The quality of the food has drop from a 5 rating to a 2 in my book. I used to like it so much that friday nights was Taco Tijuana night.Last night was the last straw i dint finish my burrito that was stuffed with dry rice and bits of carne asada. The tacos de lengua were rubbery and oozzing green tomatillo sauce .The tacos some how have shrank.The asada fries are shoe string fries coverd in sour cream and cheez with bits of carne asada. Me and my wife moved from Southen California in 2012 and had tried many places before discovering Taco Tijuana. Now they are like any fast  taco joint a copy of the equally bad Tacos El Gordo. To the due√±o of Taco Tijuana.Lla deja de viajar tanto a ver Al America y a la sleccion y deja de desquidar el changarro.
