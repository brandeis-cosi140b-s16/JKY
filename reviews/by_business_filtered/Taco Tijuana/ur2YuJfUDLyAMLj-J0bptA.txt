The food is ok, but service from front clerk was HORRIBLE. Her name was Nancy, and she was so unprofessional. To start she was on her cell phone the whole time. Being it my first time there, I didn't know you have to hand your receipt copy to the cooks so they can cook your order. Normally you hand or show the receipt after your food is presented. The front clerk Nancy failed to specify, or she might have, but I couldn't tell whether she was talking to me or her Cell. When I was trying to make up my mind, she rolled her eyes and clicked her nails on counter. When I asked the cooks about my food, she came up and yelled at ME as if I knew what to do. I thought I was the paying customer! Then when I asked the cook what her name was, she came to my table and literally threw a business card at me and said "here's the number if you want to call and complain about me". I got up, and asked what her problem was, she continued to yell at me. I thought I was on an MTV show "Punk'd". I left and called manager, he didn't seem too concerned. Never again will I come back to that place.
