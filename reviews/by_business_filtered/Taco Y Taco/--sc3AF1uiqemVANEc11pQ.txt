A decent option for the east side of town. I went twice in one week. The chicken and carnitas are pretty good but the show stopper is the Al Pastor. The beautiful marinated meat gets carved as you order an topped with all the good street Taco ingredients.
Friendly and helpful staff. The music is loud and flows through the place. Sweet new lunch spot!
