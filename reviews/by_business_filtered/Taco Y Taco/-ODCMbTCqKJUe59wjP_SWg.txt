I would have to say I enjoy this taco y taco location over the other. It looks nice on the outside as well as the inside. There's plenty of seating with the downstairs and upstairs area combined. I love the decor and how bright and open it is. I wasn't quite sure about the DJ booth, but I guess it's hip and cool huh. I also liked the bar they offered although I don't usually partake in alcohol consumption that early in the day.

My one complaint is that they stuck the salsa bar right in front of the taco lines. Of course we were there when it was busy so everyone was trying to form around it. It was a mess and nobody knew where each line was going. My second complaint would have to be the tea. After selecting the unsweetened ice tea and running upstairs to eat we discovered that it was raspberry instead. Someone made an oopsie. 

After we stood in multiple lines to get an array of tasty tacos we headed upstairs to chow down. And boy was it delicious! The Al pastor was flavorful and we also tried vampiro which we had to ask a friend exactly what that was. But in the end I think the vampiro won me over and is now my favorite. We also had elote which my son devoured before I could get two bites. Ha ha.

All in all I enjoyed it and I would definitely choose this one over the other location.
