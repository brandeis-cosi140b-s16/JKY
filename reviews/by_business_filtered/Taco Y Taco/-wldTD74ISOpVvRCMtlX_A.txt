This is a LEGIT Mexican food establishment.  I mean, I took 5 years of Spanish living in San Diego, so I can kinda get by, but this is a place where all the workers speak Espanol to each other and I couldn't keep up!  And when I ordered in English, I felt very much like a Gringo!  Damn, I wish I had practiced that Spanish more after high school!

Anyway, let's get to the food.  They have burritos, quesadillas, tacos, and bowls, but I went for the little street tacos!  I got one asada, one carnitas, and one al pastor.

Asada: Meat was very flavorful and juicy.  Sometimes when you get asada at other places, it can by dry and tough.  This stuff was delicioso.

Carnitas: They were ok, not my favorite of the three.

Al Pastor: WINNER WINNER WINNER!!!!!  This meat was INSANE.  Such good flavor, and the sauce they put on top of it was great!  Only thing I didn't like was the chunk of pineapple they put on top (I really hate pineapple), but it was ok cuz I just gave it to my husband.

Tortillas: I have a big problem with corn tortillas because they always split in the middle when you try to pick up the taco and all your innards get everywhere, but NOT HERE.  These tortillas held it together and were nicely toasted.

Salsa Bar: 1 salsa? 2 salsas?  No. SIX salsas!!!  And there was a smoky spicy one that's the kind that's so spicy, but you can't stop eating it because if you stop your lips will burn so you just have to keep eating it!!  A good burn.  Also, there were carrots and even beans at the salsa bar.

Ambiance: The restaurant is very large, very clean, and they even had live entertainment singing.

Too bad this place is on the East Side, a good 30 minutes from my house!  I want that al pastor meat every day!
