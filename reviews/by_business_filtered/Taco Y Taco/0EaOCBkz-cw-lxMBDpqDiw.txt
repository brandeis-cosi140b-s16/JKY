Ordering here is really complicated but the staff is friendly and didn't mind explaining how it worked multiple times. I'm glad the ordering process didn't turn me off because the food is fantastic. Not only is it authentic, this place is really clean! I tried pretty much everything, burrito, nachos, tacos, horchata! The meats were super tender and flavorful. The portions aren't huge but they are generous enough. The salsa bar was also great!!
