I love their tacos! The al pastor tacos in particular are delicious. We normally also get al pastor fries, as well, which are amazing.

It has a great space and tons of seating.

The biggest downside is the set up. Getting the tacos is the easiest part and the fastest but after that, the wait for anything else such as burritos, fries, nachos, etc., is pretty long. If they switched the setup, I think it would be way more efficient.

Price wise- it's pretty fair. About $2 a taco and about $7 for a burrito. So definitely nothing crazy!
