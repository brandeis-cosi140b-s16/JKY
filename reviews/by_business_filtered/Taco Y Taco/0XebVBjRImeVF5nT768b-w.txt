Went here for breakfast. Heard what's in a breakfast burrito (choice of meat, fries, and cheese?) did not sound healthy so I decided to go for the bowl. I got carnesada with pico de gallo, lettuce, guacamole, Spanish rice, and black beans. Loved how they had a salsa bar with all these condiments! My fav! I will have to try this place out for taco Tuesday's. Also they let you taste all the different types of meat
