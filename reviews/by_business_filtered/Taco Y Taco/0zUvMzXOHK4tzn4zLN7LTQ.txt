So happy here! Perfect Sundays after church we tried Taco Y Taco in Henderson, and we love the decor and ambiance! The food is super ricoooooo and I suggest trying the Nachos and Vampiro along side the tacos!! Oscar was very pleasant and the manager checked on us on arrival and while we were eating! Very happy with this gem~
