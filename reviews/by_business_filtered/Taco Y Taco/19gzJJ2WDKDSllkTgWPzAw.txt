The al pastor taco is where it's at my friends. The beautiful pork has an almost smokey BBQ flavor you just get lost in and savor with each bite.

Thus far I have had the following from Taco Taco:

Carne Asada - All right. I've had better. It needed a bit more flavor in my opinion. The meat does have some fat and gristle on it, but not much. It is a decent meat option.

SOYRIZO - yes, you read that right. This crazy little concoction doesn't even taste like it's not meat. I've had it twice and being that I prefer to have meat in my tacos it is really saying something that I've ordered a soyrizo taco twice!

Carnitas - Hmmm. Needs further exploration. The taco I got was a bit too juicy. Too much running out of the meat. I suppose it's better than it being dry though. I liked it better after I put some sauce on it.

AL PASTOR - JUST ORDER THIS OKAY? If you're going to get one thing here go with the all pastor. It's delicious.

I've only had these meats as tacos. And the tacos come in two sizes. I usually just go with the small size so I can get more tacos. So, more variety. The tortillas are handmade there.

Corn on the cob - Hello deliciousness I have never had before! Wow these things are big and totally worth it. They sprinkle it with cheese, paprika, and something else, but whatever it is it's the best corn you may ever eat.

Salsa bar is bomb. So many different choices. Plus limes, cucumbers, pickled veggies, and jalape√±os! 

Overall the food is amazeballs and the staff is incredibly nice. The restaurant is clean. So basically, just go to Taco Taco. NOW. What are you waiting for?!
