They've taken over the Republic Kitchen space and did a little bit of re-formatting but if you remember what RK looked like... it hasn't changed a lot in terms of space and feel.  

They did convert most of the bar area into walk-up, taco order stations.  There are a couple different stations which are not clearly identified so you'll just need to walk up, hail someone working and ask for what you want and they'll tell you where you need to order.  To me.... this isn't really all that convenient because you could be standing in the wrong area only to find out you need to order what you want 2 feet to your left which may or may not have a line.  And the line situation is just whoever speaks up first because the "line" isn't all that defined.

And then there's the cashier.  I don't know if she was new or just confused.  She rang us up, my husband ordered a beer which requires a totally separate transaction and then when I ordered my soft drink she said she had already processed our order and had to ring up my drink separately from everything else.  Why would you finish ringing up an order before asking if we wanted another beverage or anything else?  Not the best experience.

The taste of the food was really good and had great flavor.

But the service and the way the whole place is set up just turns me off so I doubt I'll be back.
