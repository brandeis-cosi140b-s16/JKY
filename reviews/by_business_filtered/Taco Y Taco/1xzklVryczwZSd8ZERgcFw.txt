My GF and myself were looking to grab a bite to eat somewhere cheap and in the neighborhood so we gave it a shot. We both got 6 dollar burritos (chicken for her and al pastor for me). With gaucomole, we were both very happy and would come back again. The pastor was my first here in LV and I'm pretty impressed. Very clean and nice dining areea and pretty quick service a little bit of confusion due to the language barrier but I suppose that is to be expected.
