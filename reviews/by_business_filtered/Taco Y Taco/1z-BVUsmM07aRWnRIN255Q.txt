The food is good, just like the original. Specifically, I really enjoy the al pastor and the fried fish. And the carnitas. Bonus points to this new location for the atmosphere. It's hip, but it's still "fast-casual" aaaand they have a full bar. Prices are very affordable ($2.50/taco, complimentary beans, $5 for a good selection of drafts), foods good, it's in my neighborhood....I'll definitely be back.
