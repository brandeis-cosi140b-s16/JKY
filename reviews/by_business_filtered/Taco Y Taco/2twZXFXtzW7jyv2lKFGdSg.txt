Best tacos in town hands down. I've been to lots of taco spots but this one takes the cake. It's a really spacious restaurant, it gets super hectic on weekends but the line always moves fast and I've never had trouble finding a place to sit. 
My go to tacos are al pastor, the fresh pineapple on top and avocado crema is out of this world. I always get elote as well, you can never have too much queso fresco. I've actually never had a bad taco from here. If you're feeling adventurous the lengua and beef stomach tacos are amazing. 
For drinks I either get horchata or a margarita. There's nothing special about the margarita, drink service is fast. Their horchata is really good but I can't drink more than a glass because of how sweet it is. 
Their salsa bar has a wide selection of salsas, as well as having black and pinto beans and fresh veggies. I always load up on radishes and cucumbers.
