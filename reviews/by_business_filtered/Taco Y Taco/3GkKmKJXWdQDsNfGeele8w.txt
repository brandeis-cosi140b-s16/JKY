This place is solid.  Ordering is a lil weird but oh well.  Had shrimp tacos, it was pretty good but kinda skimpy on the shrimp. Pico was outstanding probably the highlight of meal.  This place is worth a once over.  Might go back......Eastern Ave got a crapload of places to eat so it may be awhile.
