Great place to grab some tacos. The prices match most local taco trucks. There's lots of room at this location so it doesn't feel to packed. 

Although the live band isn't the best choice to have a tleast not the one that was playing tonight. The amount of profanity wasn't exactly inviting. I have 3 kids and I was a bit in shock when they started screaming F#ck. we will definitely be back for more. 

The corn is a must to get! Way better than Roberto's I'm glad they stay open later on the weekends!! Fast and friendly service.
