Omg what just happened? So much flavor! I wasn't expecting that!

I had carnitas taco, al pastor gran taco and a mexican style corn.

The carnitas taco was amazing, but i'm not sure if it was the taco itself the sauces i added from the salsa bar! Either way it was amazing.

The mexican style corn was delicious.
