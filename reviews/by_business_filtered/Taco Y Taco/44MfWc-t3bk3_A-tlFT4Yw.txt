Taco Y Taco is Henderson's hippest & most affordable modern Mexican restaurant that now has earned my taste buds attention.

This 2 story trendy hot spot is conveniently located on Eastern, just north of the 215 beltway in a commercial plaza near Twin Peaks and BJ's.

What can I write about this place?  Hmmmm...

*Everything is made to order!
**Open late til 2am Fri/Sat nights!
***Cool background music!
****Full liquor bar!
*****Large salsa bar!
******Beautiful interior design!
*******Outdoor seating!
********1st floor seating!
*********2nd floor seating overlooking downstairs!
**********Flat screen TVs everywhere!

When you walk into this two story atrium style restaurant the ordering lines 3, 2, 1 are straight ahead past the impressively large salsa bar.

Depending on what you want to order will help determine which one of the three lines you wait.
All lines offer the meat selection w/ your choice of Nachos, Mula, Vampiro, Tostado, etc. 

The friendly cashier educated us the ordering process and the difference between a Mula & Vampiro. Thanks Kassidy!

DISCLAIMER: Spell check is not on....
Marinated meats offered include:
asada (beef)
al pastor (pork)
barbacoa (beef)
buche (pork)
cabeza (pork)
carnitas (pork)
cesos (beef)
chicharron (pork)
chorizo (pork)
cochinita pibil (pork)
lengua (beef)
pollo (chicken)
suadero (beef)
tripas (beef)

It is confusing, at least for me, to understand what the difference is between all of the above. There is no description explaining the differences of these meats. The chefs were nice, and able to communicate effectively in English, but were to busy to explain the differences. I think it would be easier for people like myself to read a description of each meat to know about prior to ordering.

We tried the Barbacoa (beef) prepared Mula style. Pronounced Moooolah, like $ money! The Barbacoa beef is soft and tender and delicious! Mula style is 2 soft corn tortillas w/ cheese, the meat selected, onion, cilantro and salsa. Yum!

We also tried the Al Pastor (pork) which is shaved from a large slab similar to lamb meat when preparing a Gyro. Pronounced Yeeero! The Al Pastor was also delicious and prepared Vampiro style. Pronounced Vampeeero! Vampiro style is 2 corn tostados w/ cheese, the meat selected, onion, cilantro and salsa. Yum!

*Friendly staff!
**Clean and comfortable indoor temperature!
***Tacos, Burritos & Bowls.
****Hand made fresh tortillas!
*****Over one dozen types of marinated pork, beef, chicken.
******Grilled Shrimp & Grilled Fish!
*******Several Vegetarian Options!

Next time I want to try the Mole fries and the Mexican corn on the cob, which both looked amazing!
