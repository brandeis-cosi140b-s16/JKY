Bad Remarks first. Their menu and ordering system is very confusing and counter staff was not helpful, until the cashier helped.

I spent bank on nice restaurants in Vegas and hit Taco y Taco on the way out of town, entirely by accident. OMG! Their food is off the charts, delicious, excellent, just can't say enough good. I am from Houston who boasts a strong Latino population and my wife is Latina. But WOW....seriously....Taco y Taco makes every other cook or chef that makes this cuisine look like they don't know what they're doing. I came to the conclusion, after eating, that their ordering and menu system is designed for regulars because a place that great likely never sees newcomers, just a stream of loyal regulars. Makes consider moving to Vegas.

Folks, their prices are good, their service is good, and if  you ask for help from the cashier about their ordering process then you're in for a treat. The best of the best and by quite a bit.
