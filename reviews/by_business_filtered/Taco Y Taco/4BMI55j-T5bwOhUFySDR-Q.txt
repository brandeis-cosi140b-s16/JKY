Authentic Mexican food on the southeast side of town! Nothing fancy, just delicious food!
Love this place. So much to choose from and I would love to try more if I would stop ordering the al Pastor tostadas every time I go. 
Street corn is great, bowls are good. All the meats are tasty whether its in a taco, tostada, vampire and more. They are then topped with fresh salsas that compliment the meat perfectly. 
Their side bar is great! More salsas, black beans, pinto beans, grilled onions & peppers, pickled jalapeno carrots and more at no charge. 
The down side is ordering. You walk up to the counter where there are 3 different lines along with another side counter to order other items. Confusing for those who are new to the place and can be a cluster. 
If you can get past that, great food, great price.
