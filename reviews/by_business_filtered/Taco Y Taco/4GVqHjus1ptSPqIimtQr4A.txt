This is yet another place decently close to me that I should have visited a lot sooner.  As it were, once I finally went, I went 3 times in less than a week....

The first time, I had 2 gran tacos and a side of street corn.  The gran tacos are BIG, $3.50 each and fully loaded with cheese, meat, fresh pico, and avocado.  They are fantastic.  You pay $1.00 upcharge for seafood, which I did because I tried the shrimp.  They are loaded, in fact a couple of shrimp fell out and I still had shrimp in every bite.  The shrimp and carne asada are heavily seasoned, but not overly so.  The wife had shrimp and chicken, and I tried a bit of the chicken.  This may be the best flavored chicken I've ever had at a taco joint.  It had spice, but didn't turn my wife off, as she doesn't like heat as much as I do.  The street corn was fantastic, but messy.  So, I would recommend eating this while sitting down or next to a roll of paper towels.  

The salsa bar is maybe the best I've seen at a taco place.  8 different sauces, pickled veggies, and a pepper onion mix that they could sell for $3.00 and it would be a bargain.  You can really dress them how you like.  

I then tried a chorizo breakfast burrito (the next morning).  Probably the best breakfast burrito I've had in Las Vegas, which puts it in the running for best breakfast burrito I've ever had.  Only $3.99 and huge.  Packed with eggs, cheese, potatoes, meat and flavor.  The entire burrito was wrapped in foil which kept it piping hot.  I tried the bacon one on the next trip, but didn't like it as much.  Don't get me wrong, it was excellent, but the chorizo is where it's at breakfast wise.

I was also very impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant and the kitchen.  The kitchen appeared to be very organized, and the employees are friendly and helpful.  This is a fantastic place all around, can't recommend it enough.
