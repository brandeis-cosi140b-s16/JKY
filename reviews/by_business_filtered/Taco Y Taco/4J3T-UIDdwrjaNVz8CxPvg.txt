Kept on hearing I had to try this place!  Many kept on comparing to another taco place that is very popular  in Vegas.  Yes , yes , " Tacos el Fatty" !  Where to start ? I walked in and never as busy as the comparison  and the staff was to busy talking to each other instead of helping the few customers they did have.  I almost left, but another customer walked over and asked if it was my first time. (Probably my confused look) I Said yes and he explained how it all works.  Your typical taco place where you go order what you want from where you want it.   Tortillas smelled good and they taste home made.  The tacos were good, but nothing out of this world.  I would not compare as they hold their own, but  will admit the way they are prepared is very untraditional !  I've seen the local and the traditional  taquero who prepare a taco with passion and ensures it's delicious. These were more of Taco Bell style where they know they need to add this and that because somebody told them that is what it should have .  Making a good tacos is an art... Believe it or not!   The tacos de Asada were good and will admit better than tacos el fatty.  However then we come to al pastor !! I stand that Tacos El gordo has the best al pastor. The meat , the seasoning , and that green sauce makes the taco Amazing and Taco y Taco was good as the pineapple in top adds flavor  but the meat was a little cold and lacked flavor compared to others.   In closing if you are hungry and want tacos Al pastor and can't wait or don't feel like driving then yes this is your place.  However if you want a great tacos al pastor this would not be the place .  Also the place was not as clean as it could have been.  In my opinion  with the amount of employees present floors should have been spotless , fountain drink area should have been clean and salsa bar should have been up kept.  Oh not all was that bad .. The corn on the Cobb with all the fixing was amazing and I would go back just for that!!
