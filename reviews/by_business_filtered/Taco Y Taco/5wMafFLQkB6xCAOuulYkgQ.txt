Taco Taco Taco Taco Taco Mexican Eatery. That's what this place should be called as I would like to eat that many tacos here. 

I have been a couple times now--once getting tacos and once getting a burrito bowl. Both times I had the scrumptious al pastor--I would steal that thing and eat it on the curb like a corn on the cob. Actually I know that's gross but I still would. 

The salsa bar is where it's really at, though. There are about six different flavors that I would drizzle on cereal for chrissakes, but the real winner is the green with the little bits of avocado in it. It makes everything taste better. Are you having a horrible day? Eat the green salsa with the little bits of avocado in it. Did you just get dumped? Eat the green salsa with the little bits of avocado in it. The first time I went with Dana S. there was a woman who was literally stealing the salsas and saving them for later. She was asked to leave. Hey, I'd steal the salsas too.
