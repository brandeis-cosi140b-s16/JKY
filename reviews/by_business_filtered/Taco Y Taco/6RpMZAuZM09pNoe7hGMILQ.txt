Quick, tasty, filling. These three words describe Taco Taco perfectly. You order at the front, then move along to the different stations based on what you order. You can get your tacos customized to your tastes and watch them make it in front of you. Props for the open kitchen! I had the cabeza, carne asada and al pastor. My friend got the buche and carne asada "gran taco" style, which means it comes stuffed with cheese, beans, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream and salsa in addition to the meat. I liked the cabeza the best, soft and with the right amount of spice.

There was only one cashier at the time I went, and she was busy cleaning tables for ~10 minutes, so my tacos were getting cold unfortunately. But they still tasted good! I really liked the condiment bar once you get into the dining area. So many salsas! And they had beans!
