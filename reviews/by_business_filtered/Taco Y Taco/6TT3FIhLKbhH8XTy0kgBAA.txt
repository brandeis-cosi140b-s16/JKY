TyT still serves a g*d d*amn, m*ther f*ckin good burrito.... but not as good as the other location. My go-to, the al pastor burrito, didn't knock my socks off as it usually does. I'm gonna say it's bc you order 'ritos from a good 30 ft from the spit, so they cut of slices and keep it in a container, which dries out the meat, but really, I have no clue what the problem was. Beyond that, the salsa counter is still amazing (8 different salsas and a number of sides) and the digs, whoa, MAJOR upgrade to from the other location. High ceilings, interesting furniture... well done! Other props go to the fact that a side of guac is monstrous. That NEVER happens. 

Bottom line, is it as good at the one on Trop? No. Is it still a solid place to go for a good burrito? Yessir.
