This place rivals most OG taco joints and carts.  I guarantee you it's pretty authentic and has a flavor of it's own.  One of the few places you can get Pastor, Buche, and Lengua.  Some people find it gross.  I find it delicious.  I can't say it's for everybody but if you ever get a itch for tongue.  It's very delicious here and it's priced right.
