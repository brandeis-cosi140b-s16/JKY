Your average taco place. The reason I am giving it so many stars is because they have the BEST staff. They are all so nice and friendly. Another plus is the fact that they give you the option to get as much extra sauce as you want with no extra charge. All of the sauces, limes, salsas, and even beans are on a bar where you can get whatever you want. This is a HUGE plus for me because I LOVE their green avocado sauce. The only tacos I get are the pork. I will say I don't LOVE them like I do tacos el gordo but they are honestly so close.
