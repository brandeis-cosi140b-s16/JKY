In the area for a meeting mid-day , need some nourishment, still a little miffed Geri's cheesesteak is closed but hey, let's give Taco y Taco another try.

This time it's taco fest - 2 al pastor, one carnitas and finally asada.  I believe all were $2 each.  Wow, much better this time around.  large portions, just the right amount of pineapple in the pastor taco, geez, I think I ate all 4 in about 3 minutes ( felt that way ) - actually looked around to see if anyone noticed my piggy ways  as I was scrubbing off my face ... good stuff !!

I figure I can't push it up to 5 stars given my last visit until I have similar outcomes as this visit.  Yes, I'll be back !
