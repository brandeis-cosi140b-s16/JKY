Its not Tacos El Gordo!! I came to this location twice, first time it was good enough for us not to make the drive to Tacos El Gordo for a fix. But the second time (which was on the same week) just failed. The lady at the burrito area was talking crap in spanish calling us stupid and mentally slow. Now this is all due to a warmed up tortilla that she had to throw away. We ordered two burritos, when she was done making the first i politely asked to change the order to carne asada fries. Thats when she started talking crap and didn't realize i understood her. So everyone was laughing at us and then i ordered two tacos, one seso and one cabeza. The guy tells me just pay your order and ill get it to you. Both tacos smelled rancid and tasted old. I didn't touch it after that. 

Whats really terrible about this is that it all started by that this older lady at the burrito area named Veronica who had to throw away a warmed up tortilla and the fact that it only took a thrown warmed tortilla too intentionally try to give you food poisoning. 

This experience is at the Tropicana location. Well were never coming here again. Unfortunately, we wont even try the other location.
