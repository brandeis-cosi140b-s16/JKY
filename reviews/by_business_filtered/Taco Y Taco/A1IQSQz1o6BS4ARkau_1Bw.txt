Awesome place to try out! I was slightly overwhelmed when I walked in because of the cafeteria style line, but next one will be prepared. I had the muleta, vampiro, street corn, and chips and guac and they were all excellent! I was surprised by the format in this building because I had been to republics which it was previously. It ended up being a great change of pace and the food was great. A fun group outing as well.
