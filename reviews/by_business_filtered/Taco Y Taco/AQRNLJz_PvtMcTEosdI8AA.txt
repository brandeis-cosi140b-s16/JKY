Most of the authentic Mexican taco place are located in north LV area, but since Taco Y Taco opened on Eastern in Henderson, I do not have drive that far to cure my taco cravings. 

I stopped by this location to try their pastor tacos and their carne asada fries. This place is located in a very busy plaza next to smash burger and many other restaurants. Its very clean inside, if you are trying to eat in. I prefer to do a take out and so I did. The carne asada fries with their mole sauce and guacamole was delicious, but the tacos were on another level. The flavor was perfect and small sweetness from the pineapple made it more enjoyable. They also have very unique condiments, and I would highly recommend trying out the creamy cilantro sauce on you tacos. 

Overall (4/5) - great
