I'm upset because I came in at like 11:20 am and was told "give me seven minutes". Which has never happened to me before. So I went outside and walked around for a minute and came back and now there are 15 people in line before me. That's why I came early ... To beat the lunch crowd! Then, two guys come to the front of the line from sitting down and order like ten tacos by giving hand signals to the employees. I'm like, uh, let me in on that. Turns out, the al pastor isn't even ready. So I left. The lack of communication, lack of preparedness, and the cutting. Can't handle it.
