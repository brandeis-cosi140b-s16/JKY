I am in love!!! authentic tacos! yes I am a huge fan of tacos el gordo but this place has the nicest people working there. They are all fluent in English very friendly. The place if very clean and has a very rustic d√©cor. The food is absolutely AMAZING!!! They have many options (even vegetarian) but yet very delicious.
