I just wanted to taste something from there, and check out there prices.  I walked in and I see why it's so confusing.  Each section prepares something different.  And there also can be a communication barrier.  So I just got a Tostada, and a street corn on the cob. Again there was a communication barrier, until I got to the check out.  I was asked if I got everything I needed.  And my total.  Not a big deal.   So the Tostada, the shell was pretty hard, and burnt!  Not quite what i'm use too!  It crumbled all over the place as I ate it.  (I won't ever order that again) and the street corn!  Now that was good!  I can go there just for that.   But I do look forward to trying a few more items from here.  I want to check out the Breakfast.....I just have to get up in time for it!
