Im super picky when it comes to burritos & tacos i hadnt found a place in vegas with legit alpastor meat...... we came here on a friday night my hubby , son, & i hubby wantd burgers but i was craving the al pastor burrito after seeing all the great reviews.. goin in we where super confused the ordering process took long & workers ignored us & we just stood there confused like for 5 mins until a lady finally askd from her station & let us know how the whole process worked.... the al pastor meat was already cut and i was eyeballing the one cooking on the rotissere but where told it wasnt done we had to wait 5 more mins & since toddlers are not very cooperative we couldnt wait.... but overall it was very good much like a chipotle but better with more authentic food but really pricy 2.15 a taco & 5 something a burrito that honestly isnt that big
