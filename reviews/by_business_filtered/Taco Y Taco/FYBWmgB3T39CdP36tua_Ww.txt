A demotion to 3 stars for mere lack of good service and the overall way the place is set up. I received no greeting. There are no signs anywhere for where to order. Come to discover, that you order here for 1 thing, there for another, there for another. Its very confusing. I am not a stupid person. I can even understand and speak Spanish enough to get by if I was dropped in the middle of Spain. But, after nearing about 10 minutes of trying to be acknowledged I literally had to almost shout "I would like to order when someone is ready to take it!" 

Then I ordered Carnitas Tacos & Chicken Tacos... But, received Carne Asada Tacos & Chicken Tacos. That's OK though, because I do like both.  

Aside from that, the food was actually very very good. It's worth trying, but they need to tighten up their operation a bit.
