We yelped this place earlier today and so glad I found a legit authentic awesome vibe Mexican place! What can I say, the street tacos are super delicious and just enough spice where you don't even need some salsa. 

My wife is Mexican and yeah, it's up to par with her food haha :D  

You gotta try out the Vampiro with everything on it, you won't be disappointed.
