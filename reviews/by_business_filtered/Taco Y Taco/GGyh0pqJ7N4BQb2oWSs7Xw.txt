AMAZING!!! This is exactly the type of taco shop I have been searching for. Moving from San Diego where there is an abundance of delicious Authentic Mexican food, to Vegas where the authenticity seems sparse, I was thrilled to find a nice place to call my new go to Mexican food restaurant. 

My first experience here couldn't have been  any better. The staff was friendly and attentive and offered us various samples of their succulent meats. The Cochinita Pibil tacos...mah-gawd!! Absolutely superb...you must try it!! The meat was seasoned to perfection and left me salivating for more. Another must try is there elote; a traditional Mexican corn on the cob slathered in butter, parmesan cheese and chili. I seriously could eat this every day. 

The ambience is nice and clean, very modern and cozy. They have a full bar and large selection of beers (I went with my traditional Corona). The menu also extends to include various salads, burritos, and sides. 

I definitely can't wait until my next Taco y Taco experience and the million more visits I plan to make!! Ayayayay!!

Pro Tip: Ordering may be confusing for a newbie. You basically stand in which ever line or area you want to order food at and then get rung up at the register.
