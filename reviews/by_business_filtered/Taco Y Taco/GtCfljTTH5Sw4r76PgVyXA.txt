Taco Y Taco satisfies all of my taco cravings. They have a lot to choose from and I usually get too excited and order more than I probably should. I also really like the updated, modern decor. 

My only gripe is the ordering situation. When it gets busy, first-timers don't understand how it works and it ends up getting a little chaotic.
