Taco Y Taco offers one of the best of the taco off the strip.

They have a full range of different meats and tortilla combinations from gourmet gut busters to the simple but scrumptious three-bite street tacos. Plus, lots of different salsas to choose from.

My favorite taco's are:
Mulas - Two soft tortillas with melted cheese and the meat and toppings of your choice sandwiched in the middle.
Vampiro - Two crisp tortillas with melted cheese and the meat and toppings of your choice sandwiched in the middle.

Dining experience is cool and unexpected considering this is taco shop. 
They have a decent lounge area setup, you can order drinks and relax.  

It's worth checking out!!
