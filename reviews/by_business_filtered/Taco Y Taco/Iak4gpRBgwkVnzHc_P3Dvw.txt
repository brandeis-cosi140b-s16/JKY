I LOVE tacos. This taco y taco location is clean and has a bunch of options. My personal favorite is the suadero (beef) and elote (corn). 

The layout here is a little disorganized and you sometimes have to fight your way through to the front, but its totally worth it. Taco Y Taco (this location and the one on Tropicana) is by far the cleanest taqueria/mexican restaurant I've been to. Great happy hour deals M-F too!
