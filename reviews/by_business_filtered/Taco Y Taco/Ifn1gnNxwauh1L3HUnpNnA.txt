LOOOOOOVE THIS PLACE.
I fell on love with Taco el Gordo, but it is so far from where I live. This place is much closer from where I live! And it's basically the same!!! I love their condiment stand. I saw like 8 different salsas and sauces. Their limes were fresh. I'll definitely be comin back to this place more often!
