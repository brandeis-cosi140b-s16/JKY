The food was good and so were the prices. 2 tacos for about $2.25? Of course I'm buying! 

The exterior and interior of the place is classy. White walls with dark brown accents separates taco y taco from other regular Mexican places. It's very spacious. They have an upstair where you can overlook the restaurant.

The only thing I didn't like was the service. I couldn't hear the workers when they were talking to me and I waited for 20mins to order the corn, only to find out that they ran out. Sucks right?!

 Running out of food should never be an option in a restaurant; hopefully they have already fixed that problem. I long for better customer service, also.
