I rate all taco joints against the Mexico City standards. This place by far, comes the closest to the real thing than any other place. Even the famous taco spots in LA don't compare. I can't speak for the other menu items. The tacos are authentic and delicious. The carne asada tacos are cooked over mesquite coals while the other meat offerings are cooked to perfection in a pool of goodness. I recommend the Suadero tacos. You will not find this cut of meat mastered to perfection outside of Mexico City. Good thing this place is so far away from home or else I would be in serious trouble.
