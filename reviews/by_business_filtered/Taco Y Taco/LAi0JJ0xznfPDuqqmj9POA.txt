My final update for this place. Weakness for tacos brought me here once again. Mistake....I could not eat the atrocity they called a steak casadilla. When I asked for a refund of the item, they would not. Asked for the manager, he swore the food was made right. Asked for the owner, no call back. What a hassle when they make a mistake. Eat here at your own risk. Thank you, manager Tony M!
