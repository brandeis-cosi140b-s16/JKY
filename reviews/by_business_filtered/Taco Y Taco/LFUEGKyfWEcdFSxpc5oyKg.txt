Easy 4 stars! And had the experience not been confusing, it would be 5! YES- believe the hype, tacos el Gordo don't have nothin' on this Al Pastor! 
We entered through the back of the restaurant but there is no way of telling that from the outside. There weren't specific instructions on where or how to order, just a bunch of taco stations. Each station offered something different. I am still not sure if you order at the station, or at the person up front explaining things. 
What I do know is this was some of the best taco meat I've had, ever, in life. 
I went with 2 al pastors and one carne. They were all exceptional, but the al pastor took the cake. I could eat 5 of these, and will FOR SURE opt for the grande size taco on my next visit. 
The salsa bar had 6 salsas, carrots, onions, radishes, jalape√±os, cucumbers and limes. Did I mention besides all the awesome selections it was extremely clean?!! 
I'm hoping the confusing part will fade as they figure out how to run things because I can't wait to return!
