Oh how I love Taco Taco!!!! This is my absolute favorite place to come with the hubby for my favorite vegetarian burrito, street corn, and fish tacos. My boyfriend absolutely loves the al pastor tacos with the pineapple on top. All the workers here are so friendly and I have never had a bad experience. The prices are very reasonable and I have had a great time at both locations. It's surprising this place is in a bad area and the other location is very luxurious. I will be back for you Taco Y Taco :) thank you for the amazing food and incredible service!!
