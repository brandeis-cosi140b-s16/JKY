Without a double Cinco Estrellas!  How can this not be?

a. Authentic - My god. I have not been to any Mexican place so far in Las Vegas, where you can get mini tacos like you do in Mexico City or Guadalajara. I was immediately fascinated!

b.  Types of Food

- Buritto and large tacos (gran taco

- All that in a  bowl if you don't want the tortilla

- Small Tacos - Yes!  Simply elegant.

- The meats asada, pollo, tripas, barbacoa, al pastor (right off the rotisserie), suadero, trompa, canitas, buche, lengua, chorizo, cabeza, cesos, chicharron.  Man, if you like types of meat that are not normal, this is the place. I had the lengua (tongue), Cesos (brain) and tripas (tripe).  It was all so tasty, tender and subtle in flavor.  Amazing and delicate at same time.

c.  Vegetarians - Yep, they serve vegetarians here and have some very nice alternatives for you.  I did not try any of them as I was devouring the odd / weird meat tacos.

d.  Location - Easy to find in an oblong store on Trop and Pecos.  Decent space for seating.

e.  Extras - Nice salsa bar, although I had a hard time to ID what was spicy.  Soda Fountain and plenty of seating.

f.  Get ready for lines, and know that if you want buritto or a large taco, to stand at the main line.  However, if you wan other small tacos, they have three other lines where depending on you meat, there is a specific line for you.  So, there are actually 4 lines, but it is not easy to know this...

GK says, for some seriously authentic tacos, try out this place for sure!
