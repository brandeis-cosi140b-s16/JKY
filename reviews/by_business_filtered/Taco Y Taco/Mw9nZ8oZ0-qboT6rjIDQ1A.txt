To me this is a waste of time, came in for dinner with my wife and both of us share the opinion here, we are both huge fan of Mexican food and try new things all the time, therefor we were exited for a nice new place in our neighborhood.

Here is the final on this place: don't waste your time, not worth the hazzle.

Place looks good, in a great location although previous openings have failed here but everything else is wrong, the ordering is confusing and unorganized, there is no organic flow through the experience, the acoustic is horrible so the music played even at moderate volume becomes mindnumbing. The food is not bad though but not worth the hazzle to try, this place have not decided if it's a fastfood place or what it is, Faustos, Roberto's and even Taco Bell have a defined identity and much better system in place.

Too bad, we are rooting for management to get a wake up call and make this work like a very basic fast food place.
