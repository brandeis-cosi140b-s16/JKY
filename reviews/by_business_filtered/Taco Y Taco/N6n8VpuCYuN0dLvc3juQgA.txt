Good Mexican street tacos & sides. My favorite were the adobada mulas & adobada fries. It's clean & casual with lots of seating. A good variety of salsas at the serve yourself salsa bar with spicy carrots & radishes. The only downfall is the set up for ordering. It's an "L" shape with different stations so when it's busy it can get hectic. But the food, prices & cleanliness of the place is why it is one of my family's local eats.
