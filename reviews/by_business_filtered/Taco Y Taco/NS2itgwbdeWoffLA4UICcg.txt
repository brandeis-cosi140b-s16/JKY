After a long morning of endless walks during a tour, my friends and I needed a pick-me-up.  Because we were "hangry", we came here for lunch.  I ordered the alpastor burrito and I was NOT disappointed.  The meat was flavorful and the servers load up with whatever vegetables you want.  There was also a salsa bar up in the front so we hit that area up like there's no tomorrow.  I definitely recommend this place...especially if you have the bad case of the "hangries".
