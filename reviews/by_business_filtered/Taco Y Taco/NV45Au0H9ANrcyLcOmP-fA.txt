I love Taco Taco.

Everything I've had here is wonderful.
I love the Al Pastor, the Lengua (which I'd NEVER had before I tried it here), the Vampiro, the Carne Asada, the Mexican Street-style corn...and the fish tacos are astounding.  

Friendly and helpful, and they don't mind leaving ingredients off (I'm allergic to Avocado, so no guac here). 

:D
