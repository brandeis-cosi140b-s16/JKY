Clean. Amazing clean. It might be too clean for my liking.

The service is great. They got it lockdown. The homies for sure.

The food. I can't complain. I've had every protein. Top 3 goes lengua, tripa, and buche. Bomb dot com.

The mariachi band on Mondays is a nice addition. It automatically makes everything super authentic.
