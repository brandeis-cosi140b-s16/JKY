I used to like this place a lot, however my last visit it was quite dissapointing. The tacos were not good. The chorizo meat had no taste. Couldn't even taster chorizo and it was cold.  The Adob(just okay and cold), asada (okay), and chicken(eeeh) they say they just hand made tortillas but they use them from a package? I do give it to them. The mulas were delicious !
