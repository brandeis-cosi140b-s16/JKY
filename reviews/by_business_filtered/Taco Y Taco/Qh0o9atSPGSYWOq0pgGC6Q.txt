I tried the al pastor, barbacoa and asada tacos. The flavor of the meats were good but not great. I've had tacos that were half the price and tasted much better. I'm not saying that these tacos are expensive - I was just expecting these tacos to wow me or have a more authentic flavor. 

Their salsa bar is clean and the ingredients are fresh. The staff is also friendly and welcoming. It's a good option for the area if you're craving tacos.
