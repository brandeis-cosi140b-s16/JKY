I love this spot!  Crave it on a weekly basis.  There is one other taco shop that I think tastes excellent here in vegas. However this one is super clean, especially in the kitchen.  There's also a good amount of food options.  

I love the carnitas tacos with flour tortillas and everything on it.   Very generous with the meat.  No burned or tough meat.  Cooked tender and yummy!  

Nachos are big and good for my boyfriend and I to share.   Perfect ratio of toppings to chips. Plenty of cheese!  

The corn!!!!   Mayo, cheese, seasoning!  Must order.  

Quesadillas were too cheesy for me. Will ask for less next time. Their generosity is a quality I do appreciate though. 

Everyone appreciated a bar... Drink away!  Would like to take advantage of the live entertainment sometime. 

The music plays loud.  I enjoy the variety. At times I find myself speaking loudly to overcome the volume.  And necessary to step outside to take a phone call.
