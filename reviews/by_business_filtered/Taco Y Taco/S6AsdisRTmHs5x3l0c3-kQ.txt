The staff makes me smile which is always awesome. Ordering here is a little awkward, not your average place. They can cut the meat in front of you and you can order whatever you like then walk up to the register. It's kind of like a buffet but a served buffet. Different. 

They have a little bar, seating on a first and second floor. Everyone seemed relaxed and willing to help. I ordered a carne quesadilla and there was just a tad too much cheese for my taste. No big deal I can ask for less next time.

I will return!
