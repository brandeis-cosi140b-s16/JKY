This was exactly what I expected. I lived in south Florida for a while and they had places similar to this. I liked the different ordering stations. They were busy but people were waiting for food that was being cooked. It's made fresh to order, and it's as quick as if you were making yourself. I had the quesodilla. It was delicious. You can get sides of guacamole and pico. I'm not sure if they charge you. I also got the grilled corn on the cob. I love that. Smothered in whatever that is. With queso....me likey. I think they corn should have been boiled in salted water. It needed some salt and I think some chili powder. I liked it, but it could have been better. 
The guys working the counters were friendly and helpful. The food was quick, delicious and cheap. I'll be back for sure!
