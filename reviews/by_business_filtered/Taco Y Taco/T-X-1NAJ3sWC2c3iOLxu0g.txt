The Good: 
Taco Y Taco is like a Mexican Subway. You tell them what you want on your burrito and they make it in front of you. My absolute favorite aspect of this place is that they offer vegetarian (soy based) chorizo. The food is bomb with huge portions and is relatively inexpensive.

The bad: 
At the time we went, AFTER they made our food and we went to the cashier station, they said they don't accept credit/debit cards -_- We actually had to leave our food to get cold and go find a bank so that I could take out cash. It was a huge inconvenience and it really pissed me off that they couldn't warn the customers with a sign on the door or something. Or at least have the customers pay before they make the damn food. I will say, the cashier was very nice and apologetic about it, and I appreciated that. 

The Ugly:
The way the restaurant is set up, aesthetically makes no sense at all. It's a really weird, slightly uncomfortable environment. The 'decor', if you want to call it that, is an atrocity and again, makes no sense. They seem to be pretty busy and are doing well for themselves, why not spend a little money updating the look of the place to make it palatable. I understand it's supposed to be authentic Mexican, which usually doesn't look too nice inside. But this is Las Vegas, we get tons of tourists from all over the world, and a place that looks like that would not keep tourist coming back to this establishment.

Just my brutally honest opinion. The food is very good but it's hard to get over everything else. Next time I will definitely order for pick up instead of eating there.
