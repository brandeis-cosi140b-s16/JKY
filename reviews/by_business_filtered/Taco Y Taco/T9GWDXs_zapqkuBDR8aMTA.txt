For the past year I have been living in Las Vegas I have suffered from serve authentic Mexican foot withdrawals...then finally my savior came in the form of a gran taco. Taco Taco ahh where to I start? The taco bar?? Loaded with spicy carrots, cucumbers, all types of salsa and even beans, you can have full meal from that alone! I go to Taco Taco about twice a week and I have gotten the Gran Tacos pretty much every time, the Al Pastor is out of this world no more of this Robertos BS!. I really happy this place isn't too close to my residence or I would be there every day!. Staff is friendly even was treated to free tacos on time. Soccer on the TV, great tunes bumpin on the stereo good vibes all around hard to beat this place!
