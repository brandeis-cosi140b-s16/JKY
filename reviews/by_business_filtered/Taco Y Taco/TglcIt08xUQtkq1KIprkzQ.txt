It's places like these that make me realize Yelp is full shit. I've been here twice, first I went vegetarian simply because I don't trust the meat at a lot of places, I got a rice bowl, with beans, some weird mushroom mixture, rice, salsa and lettuce. It was flavorless and stomach churning. Got chips and guacamole, again flavorless.  I decided, it's just another shitty mexican joint that I will drive past and ignore, like most. 

A couple months go by, I hear they are opening multiple locations, I decided I must have missed something, so I went back for lunch this last weekend.  My wife and I got 2 Street corn on the cobs with "butter", chili powder and lime. Butter has quotes around it cause what they use, that shit is not butter. I got a pastor burrito and my wife got a rice bowl. We also got chips and guacamole and I got a coke. 

First, the corn was forgettable, makes you appreciate the dude selling it on the street. My burrito was God awful, the pork tastes like it's seasoned with kool-aid packets, I took 2 bite and lost 100% of my appetite. One of the worst meals I had ever had. Chips were stale and guacamole taste like it was left over from last time I was there. No salsa bar. My wife's bowl was nothing more than OK. My coke was spectacular. 

As I said, my food was terrible, but also, their ordering system is terrible, welcome to America, learn our procedures. With a normal ordering system you might be able to cut down on the 3 extra employees standing around checking their Facebook. 

Did I mention the temperature, oh ya, it was unbelievable hot in the dining area, my wife actually stood up and lowered the thermostat, it didn't help. We both left dripping with sweat and our clothes stretched out, my wife considered taking her pants off for the ride home to air out. It was disgusting. The temperature, not my wife taking her pants off. 

Lastly, this place clearly has a corrupted Yelp, don't believe any of the reviews. I wish you could give zero stars.
