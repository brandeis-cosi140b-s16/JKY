I came here on Sunday after the Brazilian Festival as we were hungry. Found this place through Yelp ( S. Eastern location) so we decided to give it a try. So as we pull up, I'm not going to lie, I automatically thought, "Oh this place won't be good as I believe their focusing on location and atmosphere rather then the taste of the food. Well,....let me tell you I was very wrong!!

The restaurant itself is nice, very modern and spacious. Has two levels. They have the tacos sectioned by the meat you want, for example; section #2, Taco Asada, Chorizo. Section #3, Buche, Carnitas, Tripas and etc. and lastly section #4, Alpastor. They also offer burritos, bowls, quesadillas and one of my favorites, Mexican corn on the cob. All tacos are $2.25 as well as your corn on the cob. The Burritos are $5.95 as well as your Bowls. The fountain drinks cost $2.50 but they have free refills including your Horchata. In the center they offer a wide variety of salsa's and sides. They have cucumbers, radish, black and white beans, green onions and the assorted salsa's. 

I recommend the tacos alpastor, they had tons of flavor and the meat was juicy and tender. Didn't care to much for the carne asada, too dry. The Mexican corn on the cob was delicious, the corn was sweet and tender. I loved this place and will definitely be coming back.

They also offer Happy Hour everyday from 6-8p, you get a $1 off their alcoholic drinks and discounts on the fries with meat. They have Brunch from 11-3p every Saturday and Sunday. Live mariachi from 6-7p every Monday and lastly they have a DJ set every Friday-Sunday.

The employees are pleasant and helpful, the restaurant is clean and the food is good. Definitely give this place a try.
