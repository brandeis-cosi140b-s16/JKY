Every time I go to Taco y Taco, I question whether I'm actually at a taco joint or a cafe in New Orleans that has live jazz on Wednesday nights. The decor and style of the place definitely doesn't match the food they sell, that's for sure.

There are 3 different ordering stations, a cash register, and a condiment bar. At the ordering stations, meat is carved and prepared in whatever fashion you prefer (tacos, tostadas, fries, etc.). You can then head over to the cash register and possibly order an elotes (Mexican corn). The condiment bar features 6-8 sauces of varying spice levels, fresh radish, grilled onion, pickled onion and peppers, and white or black beans. That's pretty rad.

I usually get the tacos, elotes, and horchata. To be frank, I don't find any of their food all that amazing. It's pretty good but there's just something missing in terms of flavor. The tortillas aren't my favorite, the tripas is never crispy, among other things. However, the marriage between the al pastor and pineapple chunks is pretty on point. The horchata is sometimes too sweet/thick as well. The elotes looks bomb but is actually pretty bland.

The convenient hours, location, and consistent food and plentiful condiment bar will keep me coming back every now and then.
