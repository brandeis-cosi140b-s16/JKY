Since this was my first time I was totally confused by their ordering process.  The staff was helpful but I am amazed at the poor ordering set up.  Cafe Rio could teach the management how to properly set up ordering. 
   I was craving some Tijuana tacos and I must say they satisfied the craving.  I had the Carne Asada tacos and they were delicious. The pork was also perfect.  I was literally transported to the streets of Tijuana during my moment of zen while devouring these great tacos.  
   The salsa bar has a great selection but to add to the confusion the lids are only given to you after payment.  Wasn't impressed with controlled salsa bar.  
   I will be back as the Tijuana tacos are very good but will eat in next time.  They have some unique food not found in the standard Mexican places.
