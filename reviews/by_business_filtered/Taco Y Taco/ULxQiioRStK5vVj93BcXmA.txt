the tacos were really good....they have several different meats to try.  The Al Pastor was by far the best...it came with mango salsa....yum!  The corn on the cob was also really good.  What got me was the price of a fountain soda...$2.50...for a styrofoam cup that you fill your self....that is outrageous...can only imagine what they charge for beer or a mixed drink.   We will go back for the tacos....but will pass on the drinks!
