I've tried all the meats and the meat I thought I wasn't going to like as much ended up being my favorite one. Crispy tripas tacos! Don't knock it til you try it my friend. crunchy meat with all the dressings with a ice cold beer. Winner winner chicken dinner all day long. staff was very friendly too and helpful with all my questions. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu.
