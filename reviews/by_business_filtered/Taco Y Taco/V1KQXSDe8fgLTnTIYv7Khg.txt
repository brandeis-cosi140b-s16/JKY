Yummy, yummy, yummy. Tacos Al Pastor are the best thing there. Followed closely by something called a "pompito", it's not on the menu but is basically steak mashed between corn tortillas that have been fries with cheese on each side the guacamole and salsa. 

For the negative reviewers who's big complaint is they can't figure out how to order, buy mine and I'll meet you there and show you how to go through the line... Or just ask, they're very friendly.
