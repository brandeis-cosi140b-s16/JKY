This place is so delicious!! Came here for the first time on Cinco de Mayo, and it was jam packed. 

My friend and I found a place at the bar to enjoy, and we definitely did. I got 1 al pastor & 1 pork belly. So delicious!! Came back here today for lunch with some friends and the experience was pretty much the same. Great food, jam packed with people. This time I tried the elote (corn on the cob). Make sure to get it with everything on it! The al pastor too - the pineapple counter acts the heat and makes it so good!

The lines seem to confuse everyone though. At each window, you find a different kind of taco/food. So just pay attention otherwise you'll be in the wrong line.

If it was closer to me, I'd definitely be here all the time. I'd for sure recommend this to all my friends!
