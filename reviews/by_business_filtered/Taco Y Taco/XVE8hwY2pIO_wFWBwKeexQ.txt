I'm a little disappointed by my beloved taco y taco today. I frequent the original location on Tropicana, but this was my first visit to the new place. While the food is still 5 stars, management really needs to step it up on service and organization. 

I saw the advertisement on facebook about the buy 2 tacos get 1 free for Cinco de Mayo for both the 4th and 5th. The advertisement said for the Eastern location only so I thought it would be a perfect time to check out the new digs. When the girl at the register told me the price, I thought it was a little high and asked if she applied the deal. She informed me that the deal was only for the Tropicana location! I told her that's not what the ad said, and I guess a lot of people came in under the same assumption, but she was still not willing to apply the discount. As soon as I got home I checked out facebook again, and they recently posted a new ad listing the Tropicana location, and deleted the old one (clearly trying to cover their tracks). But those tricksters forgot to delete the twitter one that still said Eastern. Good try, but I caught you! Overall, things just aren't running as smoothly at this location as the original, but it's still early so I'll give them some time to work out the kinks.  But like I said, management really needs to get things in order. 

Despite my frustration, I can't deny the tacos. Between the 2 locations, I've tried the al pastor, lengua, tripas, carnitas and asada. The al pastor is definitely my favorite, followed by the carnitas and lengua. The asada is just ok, and the tripas was good but they didn't make it extra crispy as I requested. 

I'll be back, but I'll probably stick to the Tropicana location for a few more months and give the new place some more time to hopefully get things running more smoothly.
