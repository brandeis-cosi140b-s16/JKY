First expect to be confused and frustrated... I was warned, and read the reviews, so I was prepared... I can't imagine how it would be during peak hours. The way you order and pay in separate lines for different items is wacky!!
The music is loud... 
Suck it up, your not here for service, or to feel especially welcome. Your here for tacos, and that's what they deliver. 
I only had two (plus nachos, waste of time).
The pastor was great, a little heavy handed with the pineapple salsa. But I won't ask them to change a thing for me.
The carnitas tacos were dressed entirely different than the pastor, and just as bold and delicious.
The salsa bar may take me 5 more vists to really get into, cause the tacos are so right, I don't need any salsa. The pickled veggies in several varieties is worth a run.
The nachos were ok.. If the tacos weren't so good, I'd have liked them more. I realized i cheated myself out of an additional taco by having them. 
Short version:
Definitely coming back. 
It will be loud, ordering won't make sense; the staff will try (in vein) to make it seem that this all makes sense to them, but I won't care. I'm not here for order, or quiet.
Keep your eye on the prize...
I'm here for the tacos.
Taco y Taco
