Thanks to some friends word on the street got out fast about this new place, and I'm passing it on. It's delicious. 

On Mondays from 6-7 they have a live mariachi band. Even though I had to yell for my order to be heard, I loved listening to them. I want to go back next week almost for that alone. 

I asked for recommendations from Ray, the duke of the other location and I'm so glad I did. 

He recommended starting with the tacos (but try everything). Also he explained how it works. You start at station 1 (el Pasteur tacos) then work your way around to the cashier. Also, bring some ones to tip these guys.
 
The food: amazing
Highly recommend the corn on the cob. So good, covered in butter and cheese. 5/5

I got the shrimp burrito. The grilled up the shrimp fresh, added whatever I wanted on the inside and grilled it. It was good but I thought some of their other food was better (read: get the tacos) 4/5 

Tacos 
3 el pasture delicious! Get it! 5/5

2 carnitas so tender and delicious (my fav) 5/5

3 carne asada good 4/5

My mother-in-law got the carnitas burrito bowl. Didn't try it but it looked good!
