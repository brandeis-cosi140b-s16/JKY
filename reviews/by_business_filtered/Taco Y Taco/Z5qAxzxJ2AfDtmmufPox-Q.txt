There are a lot of Mexican places to choose from in vegas, but of all I've tried Taco Taco is the best. You hear their ads on the radio all the time and even though the ads are annoying, the food is great. The prices are very reasonable and there are a whole lot of options. The Asada tacos cannot be beaten by any spot in vegas.
