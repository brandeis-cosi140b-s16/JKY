This place is for the taco conoseiur... They have it all: beef, pork, fish, chicken, and shrimp. You line up in line, order your tacos, and they make them right in front of you. The tacos are small - street style - but pack a serious amount of flavor!

Hubby ordered the chicken and carne asada tacos. I ordered the shrimp and fish tacos. They also sell Mexican street corn, too, but beware - if you want it cut off of the cob they charge you an extra $2 just for that.

The tacos were flavorful and perfectly seasoned. The meat was nicely accompanied by lettuce, pico, and a spicy sauce (chipotle maybe). So for 8 tacos, Mexican corn, and a coke, it came to about $35. Kind of steep, but you get what you pay for here. I will be back!
