Amazing! Greatest hidden Gem in Vegas! Awesome service and authentic food! Try the Corn.....OMG! The menu is a little confusing but they are willing to help you order. The Salsa bar is amazing as well. The only criticism I would give is they need Queso and chips. So, if your reading.....bring the Queso!
