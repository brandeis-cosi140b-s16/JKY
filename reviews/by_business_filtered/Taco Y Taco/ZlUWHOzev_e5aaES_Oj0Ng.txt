So I decided to try something new over my favorite place to go get a salad (cafe rio)

I had heard wonderful things about this place so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try.

It was a Tuesday afternoon around 2:30 pm when we walked in. We had never been before and a lady immediately addressed us and asked if she could be of assistance. She explained how everything worked and then we got into our designated lines to order. 
We waited for 5 minutes before I asked her if anyone would be taking my order. She looked at me and told me the gentleman (who was on a phone call) would be able to help me when he was done.
I was a bit confused because her and 2 other people were standing around. He then got of the phone call 5 minutes later and apologized about the wait.

I wasn't sure if I wanted a chicken or carne bowl so he allowed me to try the meat.
I decided to go with the Carne bowl. Lettuce, white cilantro rice, bell peppers and onion, pico de gallo and pinto beans. 
My boyfriend got a Carne burrito. They were going to charge us $1.25 for a small container of guacamole but I think the gentleman just let it slide due to us having to wait.

We then went up to the second floor to eat. This was nice, however I would recommend placing a drink machine with utensils and maybe a small salsa bar up there as well. (we had to walk down to get refills and needed utensils)

We then bit into out food...
That has to be the worst carne I have ever eaten in my entire life!
It was so extremely salty that it made the whole meal unenjoyable. My boyfriend said the same for his burrito. 
I literally got a headache from how salty the food was about 2 hours later after leaving.

the 2 meals plus a drink were around $19.00 but honestly not worth it.
I don't think I will be trying this place out again.
