This place is amazing! My husband and I lived in cancun for a year and since coming back, 2 years ago, we haven't been able to find Mexican food comparable to what we had down there-until taco y taco came into our life. The al pastor is EXACTLY like sitting street side in Mexico and not very expensive either. Getting tacos, burritos, and bowls; lots to choose from. All of their ingredients and salsas are really fresh! If I had to choose a quick Mexican dinner, I'd choose here.  

The decor is so clean and modern. There is so much space inside and lots of tables for seating. On Saturdays they have a live DJ which is fun.
