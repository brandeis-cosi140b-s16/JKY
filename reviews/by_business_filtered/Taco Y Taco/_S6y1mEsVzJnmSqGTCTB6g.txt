This place can be a little intimidating if you've never been. Four different lines and a ton of options. Try the Alpastor taco (amazing) and a vampiro (basically a crunchy quesadilla w/meat). If you get a little lost ask someone for help and they'll happily guide you through the menu and they let you sample any of the meats (if your feeling adventurous).
