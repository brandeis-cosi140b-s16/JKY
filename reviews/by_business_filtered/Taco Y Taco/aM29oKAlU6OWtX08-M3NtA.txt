It is so hard to stay away from this place.  The food is awesome, the drinks are awesome, the staff makes the place enjoyable.

I have never had bad food here, everything I have tried is authentic and awesome.  The staff is unreal, a girl kept coming by our table asking if there were things to clean off, if she could get us more drink, she is there most of the time that I have been there and a really nice person.

There were two ladies there yesterday who appeared to be the owners of this place as the kept going in and out of the back, they were at the bar working and several times walked around just observing.  We were there for a long time, I went to,the bar several times, (no judging), and not once did they say hi or come by any of the tables which to me was kind of strange as there is no better way to promote a positive atmosphere then coming around and saying hi.

On one visit to the bar to get more drink I even got kind of a look like "why are you invading our space" which my reaction was like "get over it, I'm spending money here".  All the was non verbal, but the messages were received.  I love the food but there is nothing that will bring down an atmosphere faster then a snobby owner.
