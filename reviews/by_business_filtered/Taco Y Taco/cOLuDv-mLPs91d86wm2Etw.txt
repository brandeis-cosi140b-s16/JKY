Finally had a chance to hit TT last week since I was in the area around lunch time.  Geez, not sure why this place is getting so much love.  I gotta admit, I was in a bad mood after parking, then walking by Geri's and  it appears the place has permanently closed - downer.

So I walk in TT and confused by the lay out - a bottle neck at the register made it difficult to get to the apparent front of the store.  After almost causing a scene when my big butt bumped into another's tray as they were heading to the dining area I finally make it to the ordering area.  I went with an al pastor and an asada taco along with a Mexican corn.  

As I sat in my car looking at the food, I frequently compared what I saw with what I get at El Gordo.  I feel the tacos are slightly larger at EG.  Also believe the pastor at EG is more flavorful.  Frankly, I found the TT food had little flavor.   The  corn - basically uncooked and not much in the way of cheese. I did like the sauce selection and the service was friendly.  I feel I need to give the place a 2nd chance and I will ... someday.
