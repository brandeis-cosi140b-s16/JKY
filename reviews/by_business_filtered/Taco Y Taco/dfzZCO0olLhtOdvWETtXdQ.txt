Great "street" tacos. Pollo, Carnitas, Al Pastor...all great. Fresh homemade corn tortillas (of course). I even had a Mexican Coke - with pure cane sugar - none of that high fructose corn syrup poison American soft drinks have. 

Mole Fries were super. Sweet potato fries with Pollo, mole, cheese. Wow. 

Just watch out: easy to order and eat way too much.
