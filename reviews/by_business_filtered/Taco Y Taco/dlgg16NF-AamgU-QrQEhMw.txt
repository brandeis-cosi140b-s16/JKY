I think this restaurant may have an identity crisis, I'm not sure if it wants to be a Chipotle or a Faustos/Robertos of sorts. Either way it fails miserably. While sitting here at my table I have watched the cashier touch the sour cream bottles multiple times while the person on the line is touching them while making the food, a guy making street tacos dip something in a sauce bare handed and eat it and the bartender call a girl "big booty hoe" I quote. Now that I told you about the show lets talk about the food..........oh yeah nothing special there. It taste like well nothing. Nothing stood out from the burrito, the nachos or the corn.
