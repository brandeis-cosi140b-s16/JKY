Mexican food isn't usually my go-to when I'm hungry, but I truly enjoyed my experience with Taco Y Taco. I kept hearing the ads on the radio so I thought I'd give it a try when I was in the area. The service was friendly, the food was delicious, and the ingredients were super fresh! This is probably the only place in town I'll go to for Mexican food.
