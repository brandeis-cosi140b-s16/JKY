Imagine the best food truck tacos you have ever had and you get Taco Y Taco. I am a frequent customer. It can get busy so I try to go on the off times a little bit. There is another location on Trop, but I like this location a lot more.

They have a wide variety of meats for you tacos along with other dishes like mole nachos and Mexican corn. Tacos are $2-$3 each but they have a happy hour. There is also a bar and occasionally a DJ. 

Probably the best praise I can give is that I make sure to bring all my out of town guests here as part of their Las Vegas experience.
