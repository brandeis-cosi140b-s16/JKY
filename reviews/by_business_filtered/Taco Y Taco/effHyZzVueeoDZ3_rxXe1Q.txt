It sucks having to drive all the way to charleston and etc... for mexican street tacos but I usually suck it up and just do it. Taco y taco gives me that option to avoid driving down to the east side but taste and price is at a compromise. 

There is a paper disclaimer in the small walkway to the restaurant warning people that this place is open to foodies with an open mind and some of the options they have will make people turn around. Honestly though... those options are worth the risk. 

Interior: BIG, so big that there is a second floor to eat tacos. Some days they have a dj spinning edm sort of music otherwise it's popular mexican songs. Clean for the most part and they have someone rounding all the tables to wipe up.

Food: Your standard taco joint options with the addition of burritos, and street corn. I always go for the al pastor (spicy pork on a pineapple spit) or the lengua (tongue) always tender with no foul odor. The street corn is just like the ones you'd get from the carts, cheesy with mayo and a slight kick from the tajin. Their burritos are a hit or miss, miss in the sense that the white rice will be mushy and ruin the burrito. Otherwise it's on point and make sure you ask for the cotijas (mexican parmesan cheese) it goes great.

Price: a bit higher than your regular mexican restaurant but not by much.

Overall: a nice option to get authentic mexican tacos in henderson but places like tacos el gordo is still better
