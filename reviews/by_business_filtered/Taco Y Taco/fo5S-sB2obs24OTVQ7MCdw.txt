It felt kind of too upscale for what the food is. It was like an upscale Tacos el gordo where I feel like my car wont get broken into but the food is just....close but no cigar. I'll come here for the corn... and when I need a taco fix and dont feel like driving downtown.... but nothing compares to the awesomeness that is the adobada at Tacos el Gordo.
