2 star because the food is actually good, but be warned, you may wanna pay attention to the total they ring up. Twice I have been charged incorrectly, one of which didn't even occur till I saw my bank statement. Added a tip I didn't authorize or something of that nature. Their menus are misleading as well. Vampiros are clearly listed on a menu with a price tag of 2.15 (my memory is foggy, but it's for sure listed as under 3 dollars), however when asking the lady at the register, she laughed and said no. Turns out their almost 4 bucks. If shady business practices don't discourage you, the food is actually good. I won't be returning
