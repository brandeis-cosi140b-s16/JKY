Public service announcement! This is pronounced "Taco eee taco" not "taco why taco"... thanks. I know we're in the USA and all, but since when does being an American give you the license to be dumb?... well... OK lets not get into that. 

This is a great spot. The tacos here are traditional "street food" style Mexican tacos... they are simple, quick, cheap, and really tasty. Overall a very authentic feel to it all. If you have ever been to the iconic "Tacos el Gordo" this place is much like it, but perhaps with a bit less charm (maybe not the right word...) since the feel is a bit more upscale and less like you are in downtown Tijuana (as is the case with Tacos el Gordo). 

During popular times there is a DJ in here and they really go for a hip/party type atmosphere (full bar too - with Corona on tap... which seemed rare to me, but maybe I don't frequent enough Mexican joints)... which for me means I try to grab a spot in the other corner, because I'm just trying to get my taco on, not jam out. 

Been here a few times, and will definitely keep coming back. An outdoor patio would maybe put this place over the top for me, but it's in an already overcrowded strip mall unfortunately, so I think they have limited space to work with.
