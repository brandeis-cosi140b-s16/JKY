Taco y taco has the same concept as tacos el Gordo. Each section has its specific meat that you line up for, order the type and quantity, and then pay. However, this place offers elote which is pretty good!

The al pastor is my favorite here. They dip their tortillas in the oils that the meats are simmering in and they add pineapple to their green sauce they lather on the al pastor tacos. The barbacoa is tender but on the more meatier side if you like the taste of well cooked meat.

I've never got to try their lingua cause they always run out, so I'm assuming that one is bomb. The horchata is good here and refillable too. 

There are 2 entrances, one on each side of the building (it's on a corner island of the plaza. Anyways, good bites!
