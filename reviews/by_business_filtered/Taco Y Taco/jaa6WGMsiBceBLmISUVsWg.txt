I have heard from my brother over the last couple months how great this place was and finally decided to try it.  I will start with saying that the food was okay.  Everyone keeps talking about how it's "authentic" Mexican food.  If authentic Mexican food is just cooked meat, then yes, that's correct.  But there is nothing special about it.  There was meat and salsa on small tortillas and one burnt tostada shell.  That's it.  Granted, I could have probably had them add other stuff to this, but unfortunately, as you have read in the other reviews, you have to stand in line for everything you want and that includes just wanting a little cheese.  After 5 minutes of the guy building some nachos and discussing family member and how great the restaurant was, I gave up and decided to forego the cheese.  Seriously, is this a challenge to see how many lines you can force me to stand in before I just give up?  They really need to read these reviews and make some adjustments or they are going to be like half the other restaurants on Eastern and be gone within a few months.
