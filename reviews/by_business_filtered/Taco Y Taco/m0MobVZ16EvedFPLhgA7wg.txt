The el pastor vampiro's might be one of my favorite things to eat here ever!

If you are with out the kids, try to grab a seat at their bar. The two guys that work on Saturday nights really have some great recommendations and can whip up a mean cocktail!! Be patient, their master pieces need a little time since they actually muddle real fruit and mix their own seasonings.
