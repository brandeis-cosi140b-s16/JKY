Although I only enjoy eating the corn on the cob dish. I seriously think that taco y taco deserves some credit for how fast their service is, as well as how friendly they are. I get my food right when I order it & the environment is positive! Good place for groups & families def a wonderful place to try! 

& the only thing that set me down a notch with their rating was due to how poorly they had their signs marked on where to go. Of coarse a gentleman escorted me right to the back where I needed to order after he noticed it was my first time in there. But I recommend that they clarify that a lot better for future customers (:
