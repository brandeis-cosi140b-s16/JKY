Been here several times now and have had nothing but GREAT food every time!! Al pastor is out of sight good, carnitas done right and that evil Mexican street style corn that keeps me up at night craving more, I may need an intervention if I eat any more of that corn!! Yeah the service line at the eastern location is a little quirky, but once you get the hang of it, it's all cake baby!!
