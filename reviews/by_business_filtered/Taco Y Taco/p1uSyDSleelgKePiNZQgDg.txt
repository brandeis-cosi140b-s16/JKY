Yes, I'm a fan of their Al Pastor taco.  I get it loaded up with everything except pina...don't like sweets on my taco...and I go at it!  Fresh meats and hand made tortilla are the game changer here.  Service is good too.  Lot of times the guys joke around and engage in a brief conversation when you are ordering, which is always nice.  They took over the old Republic Kitchen which took over the old Fado so the ambiance is really nice for a taco concept.   I think the Sansone group has a long term tenant with these guys.
