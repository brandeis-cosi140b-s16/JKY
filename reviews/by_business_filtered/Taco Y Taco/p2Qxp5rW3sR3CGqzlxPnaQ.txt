Where have you been all my taco life? I just tried some tacos at the Yelp 88xxxihibition event. They were amazing!!! I was raised on the border, and these are as authentic as they get. The tacos al pastor were...my mouth is literally watering right now. Apparently everyone else thought they were awesome, too. The line to get a taco was 15 persons deep when I was waiting for taco number two. Thank you, Yelp, for introducing me to them. I'm excited to visit the restaurant and will report back!
