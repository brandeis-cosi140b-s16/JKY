If you know good Vegas tacos, then you will know what I mean when I say this place is an awesome combination of Los Tacos and Chipotle.  But cheaper and just as good.  

My coworker and I decided to try this yesterday for lunch, on a whim.  We were a bit confused about where to start the order, but once we figured it out, it was fine.  We ordered the Grande Carne Asada taco, rice and beans, and chips and salsa.  All of it was goooood!   There is a salsa bar with about 6 different salsas to pick from. 

The tacos were big and full of meat.  The staff was super friendly and welcoming.  

Tacos don't get a lot of attention in this celebrity chef, fancy schmancy restaurant market.  But these tacos are good!!  

Why does it get 5 stars?  Because I would return tomorrow to try something else.  Or to order the exact same thing!
