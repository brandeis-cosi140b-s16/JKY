I love Mexican food. Especially when it's Real Mexican food and this place is great. Been to a place similar so we tried the al pastor tacos and burrito. So good! All the salsas were great and spicy, also got the Mexican style corn and my boyfriend inhaled it! Can't wait to try the quesadilla , bowl and vampiro , it's far but worth it !
