Great hang out for friends or large groups. Authentic Mexican food. I had a carne asada burrito with everything except rice, so delicious. The meat was grilled and not boiled like many other Mexican fast food places. I will be coming here again soon. The jimica was fresh and not watered down either. A must try new restaurant!!!
