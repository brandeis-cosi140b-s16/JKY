Been wanting to try this place out for a long time and finally made it today. They have street tacos of all kinds of meat, burritos, nachos, tostadas etc. We had tacos el pastor, asada fries, carnitas taco, and tostadas de buche. Loved the tacos el pastor! They had great flavor. Also liked that we could order beers or whatever. If u like authentic street tacos then this is the place to go!
