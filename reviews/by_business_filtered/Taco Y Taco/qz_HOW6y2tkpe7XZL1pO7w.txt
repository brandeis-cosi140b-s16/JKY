FINALLY. My fave taco spot is closer to my house AND THEY HAVE A FULL BAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1 tequila, 2 tequila, 3 tequila, floor.

Cannot believe this is even a taco spot considering all the chandeliers, 2nd floor loft, and d√©cor reminiscent of Honey Salt's brick walls.

I would write more about Taco y Taco but, nothing beats writing about it than eating it....BYE, GIRL BYE....driving there now for some al pastor and eloteeeeeeeeeeee =) weeeee weeee weeeeeeeeeeeeee
