I've had the luxury of having my first meal from this location. I've picked it based on the reviews and the photos I've saw. Since I'm trying to find a good burrito that reminds me of what I've had in LA for years, I'm trying many locations. I went here for a simple asada burrito.

While it was good, it was also pretty generic. It reminded me of what I was able to get inside a Chipotle but for more expensive. I paid almost $9 for a small burrito and all the toppings & taste were the same. This is not bad but for what you pay, you expect something to knock you out of the park. That did not happen here.

I'm sure other food might taste better but my review is based only on the one burrito I had. It was very clean inside and had a somewhat easy way to place an order.
