I think I'm with fellow yelper Suzy H....the "lines" are a bit confusing and irritating. We stood in 3 different lines just to get a couple tacos, mole fries and a quesadilla. Not to mention the line to pay in. Oh, then the salsa bar line. Ugh. 

I couldn't find the napkins either and that irritated me. We sat upstairs and waited 30 full minutes for them to get our mole fries to us. I am positive they forgot after 2 reminders even. I watched two guys get theirs with no problem. They consisted of sweet potato fries with a mole sauce, chicken, and cojita cheese. This was worth the 3 stars. The tacos were soaked in a weird sauce and the quesadilla was so plain I wanted to take it back. 

The decor was cute and hip. There is a full bar. They have "patio" seating but I can pass on that. It's 3 tables on the side of the building. 

I'm pretty sure we won't be back. Nothing impressed me there and it's not close to home anyway. :)
