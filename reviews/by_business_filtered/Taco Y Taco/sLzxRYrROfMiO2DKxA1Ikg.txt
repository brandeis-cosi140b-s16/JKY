Unfortunately I didn't have the 4 star experience I was expecting based on the reviews I read. That being said, I don't see what the hype is all about. I think people may have quantity confused with quality, because variety is just about the only thing this place has to offer. The line system was non-existent and employees walked around sweeping, yet didn't offer help to new customers that were clearly clueless. The music (techno & house) was blaring and not at all in tune with the supposed authentic Mexican experience the numerous signs claim you are said to encounter. And then there's the food, which was really just...blah. All in all it was a huge dissapointment unworthy of a follow up visit, which is a bummer because I'd been looking forward to eating here for quite some time.
