It was slightly complicated to order food at Taco y Taco. However, The staff behind the counter will guide you to the right direction. 
It took me a good solid minute to make sure I was at Taco y Taco from outside of the restaurant. Because the sign was missing the Y! Maybe I am blind. 

So, I walk in proudly from the wrong side of entrance to the restaurant. AKA: EXIT! I felt like a dumb lost tourist on the strip, but anyway, I attempt to place an order for some tacos trying to pronounce the meat selections in spanish and they understood me. Whoo hooo!!! 

Burritos are awesome!! You can customize it like the Subway. Tacos are super tasty! Free grilled green onions and Jalapenos!!! And there is a freaking sink near the taco station!! Thats a big plus for me because I have OCD, very mild one, I just like to wash my hands before I eat. They have corns and Coronas are only $2.50!!!! Say what?!?!???
I am like give me a case of Coronas!! and take my money already!!

I really like this place! super clean and staff are extremely helpful and nice!
