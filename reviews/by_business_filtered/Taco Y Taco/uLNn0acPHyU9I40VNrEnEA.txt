The food here is delicious. They have a great al pastor and asada, as well as all sorts of specialty cuts (lengua, cabeza, etc). Burritos are tasty too, and it's easy to order a simple plate if you don't want to try something new. Some of the salsas are HOT! Cute set up now that they have got things up and running (we came right after they opened and it was still a mishmash with the bar bistro that was there before). 

Lots of seating and a good selection of beers if you want to have one with your meal. Authentic and pretty reasonably priced. Taco tuesday is where it's at for a deal!
