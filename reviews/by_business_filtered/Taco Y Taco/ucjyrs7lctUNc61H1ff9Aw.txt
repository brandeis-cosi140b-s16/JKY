I've been waiting for this place to open!! So glad I found out it was open and went there for lunch. Now I'm not much of a meat eater so I can't tell you about that but what I can tell you is that the food is fresh. 

We had the carne asada fries, I ordered it without the meat. Fries covered in shredded cheese, guacamole and tomatoes. The lady taking my order had the cook come over so I could tell him exactly what I wanted. He was very nice and made it just the way I asked. My Mom had a carne asada taco and she said it was good, but they fry the tortilla and she said it was greasy. My favorite thing is the salsa bar they have. So many things to choose from. We had all of this and 2 drinks plus chips for $15! Awesome!

It's really cute inside, the staff are friendly and the food is great. I will be back again soon.
