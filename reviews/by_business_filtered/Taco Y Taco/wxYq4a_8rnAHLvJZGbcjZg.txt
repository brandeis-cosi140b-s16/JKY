This was my 2nd time eating here.  I ordered 3 tacos. Asada, chorizo, and al pastor. Bleh.

An hour later I am puking and have nasty foul diarrhea that lasted the entire night and well into the next day.

Never ever again will I eat here.  

I think I will call Health Dept or Food inspection.

NEVER AGAIN.
