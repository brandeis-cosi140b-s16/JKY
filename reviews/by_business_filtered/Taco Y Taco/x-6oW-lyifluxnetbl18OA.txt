Loved everything about this place. Close to where I live #1. The pastor was so flavorful along with all the different salsa options. The mole sweet potato fries were amazing, and paired perfectly with the margarita de casa. The margarita was so tasty that I had to get a second one, and could've sat there drinking them all night. I love the fact that they get all their meats and tortillas from Los Compadres which is one of my favorite carnicerias in town. This will definitely be my new taco spot.
