Incredible tacos, great people, they will help newbies if you are unclear about whats going on and will let you sample the different kinds of meat. Sit at one of the 5 stools at the bar and they will bring you food! The mixologist (Omar) is incredible and the spicy margarita it too good to be true! Definitely the best street tacos, and an authentic Mariachi Band on Monday evenings 6-7pm.
