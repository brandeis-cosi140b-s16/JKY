Im not sure that people in Las Vegas no the differance between mediocre Mexican and great authentic food. But Taco y taco is not good let alone great. The carne asada is the cheapest beef they could buy, the ordering process is really really bad, and not planned or thought out very well, the food was dry. The salsa bar was the highlight of the restaurant, but food is not that impressive at all i would pass on this place. I get the whole idea behind trying to give people authentic mexican food  in and upscale setting (Henderson) but this place fails to impress a Cali boy who knows the differance between real Mexican and not so great food. I would rather make the drive over to El Panzon over on Sunset and Sandhill, its a hole in the wall, but you will get great food, or just go to Los Tacos, its much better than this crap.
