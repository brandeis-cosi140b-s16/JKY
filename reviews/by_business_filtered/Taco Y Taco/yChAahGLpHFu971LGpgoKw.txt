Taco y taco is good.... i still prefer taco el gordo.... but lets start with the menu.. the tripa tacos very delicious.. the chicharon tacos man that got me all pissed off i thought it was real deep fried chicharron.. not the chicharron that i can go to mexican store and buy in a Styrofoam  container..... come on you could have had a 5 star but dont offer the simple chicharron.. make your own give it some flavor... every thing ealse was good.. place is clean and well taken care of...

Health wise please put a cover on top of soda machine.. i see you put ice and over pack it .. i dont have a problem with that.. my problem is that ita right under a vent so what ever blows down goes straight into the ice....
