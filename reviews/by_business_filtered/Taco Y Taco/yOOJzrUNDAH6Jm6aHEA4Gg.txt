Great food, very fresh.
I had the vegetarian burrito,  I must say that if they advertise as having vegetarian options, staff needs to know what vegetarian is exactly.  You cannot have the Spanish rice as they use chicken broth to prepare it. And the black beans have pork in the broth.  So you really need to ask a lot of questions.  But once you figure it all out,  the food is great! 
I noticed prices have gone up as well.  Mole' fries were $7 now they are $10. And the burritos were $6, now they are $9. 
All in all I still love the service and side bar,  so I will be back :)
