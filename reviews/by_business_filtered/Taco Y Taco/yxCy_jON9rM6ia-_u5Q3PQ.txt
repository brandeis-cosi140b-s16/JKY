The picture comparing the burrito to an arm is a lie! My burrito wasn't half the size of my girlfriends arm! :(

Anyways... below mediocre burrito but their taco's are comparable to taco el gordo.

The place is located on tropicana & pecos in a pretty big plaza. The interior of the place is super clean and spacious. Along with a well stocked sauce bar.

Walking in I was a bit confused on where to order but soon realized it was laid out like tacos el gordo. Order what you want at a specific window. And the ordering process for a burrito is similar to that of chipotle. Have an empty tortilla and fill it up with your own personal preferences. 

In the end I ordered the asada burrito & pork taco. Burrito was pretty lack luster since I couldn't even taste any of what I was eating. Taco on the other hand was suppppppperrrr juicy. UNFFFF. 

Pro tip: You can get free elote if you vote for them on best of vegas :o
