So glad my boyfriend found this place! Everything is fresh and made to order. Having never been before I was confused on ordering but the nice lady behind the counter directed me that each station has different items and you go to the ones you want. Mexican street corn so yummy! Everything is delicious but my favorite is tacos al pastor. Also they have homemade horchata and hibiscus drinks! This location is very clean, just look behind the cashier counter and you will see what I mean. Also I tip each person at the stations I go to!
