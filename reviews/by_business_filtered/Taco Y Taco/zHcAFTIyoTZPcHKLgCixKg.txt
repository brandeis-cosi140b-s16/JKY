HIP WITH LOUD MUSIC

It helps to have some sort of preminition as to what you want to eat. It's all about tacos and nachos. The two quintessential tacos to order are the Pastor and Crunchy Tripe. As for nachos it's a sloppy and soggy adventure.

Cleverly, this restaurant has zero Mexican ambience. No table service. Go directly to the taco station offering the meats you wish to select. If you're not sure, don't get in line. Food is placed on your cafeteria tray and when you have collected all your goodies, head to the smiling cashier.
