This place has about the same setup as Tacos El Gordo. Three stations to order your food from. It is cleaner, roomier  and newer than El Gordo. As soon as i walked in, I saw a familiar face, it was so funny. Jose used to work at El Gordo and now is the manager here! We ordered one taco of each of the meat (pork, chicken, beef)available, intestines, tongues. I think we ended up with 14 because some meats are cooked differently. We also had two vampiros and two Jarritos soda (pineapple and lime). There is a free salsa and sauce bar. Try the creamy light green one, it cools off the spiciness from the tacos. Everything is delicious, I think everyone in Vegas should make a trip here. :) The cashier also told me that they will be opening up a new location on Eastern soon, can't wait! I saw quite a few locals ordering burritos wrapped in tin foil to go. Maybe I will try one next time.
