True Mexican street fare - at first a little intimidating for this Gringa, but it was awesome.   The owner Dan (who happens to be a Culinary Institute trained chef) put together a variety pack for us.  Everything is small and cheap, so you can get a whole bunch of different stuff to try.  $30 fed 5 people.

On the NE corner of 19th Ave & Glendale, next to 7-11.  Give 'em a try - you won't be disappointed!
