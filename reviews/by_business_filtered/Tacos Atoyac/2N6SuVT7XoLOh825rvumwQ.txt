Atmosphere - very small and lacked air conditioning. Whole in the wall kind of place. 

Fish tacos - Super!!! Nice and hot. When you take your first bite, CRISP and flavorful.
 You may need to consume at least four to be full. They are mini tacos. 

No salsa bar. They give you tiny containers with sauce. 

Expect long lines, since they were featured on yahoo.
