Thank you, Java Magazine!  Had I not picked up the latest copy at Circle K, Tacos Atoyac would have remained an unknown in my life.

The food here is amazing.  For lunch I tried every taco on the menu (carne asada, al pastor, lengua, chorizo and tripa o cabeza) and one off menu (carne asada/chorizo mix) plus the Oaxacan hotdog (diced bacon, black beans) and a bottle of Mexican Coke.  Not only was it all delicious but it was dirt cheap.  All was had for just over $10.  

Be sure to try the house sauces.  The have a green and red and a fantastic guacamole sauce.

One of the owners mans the cash register and the other cooks your food.  Service is friendly and quick.

Best tacos around.  Easily.
