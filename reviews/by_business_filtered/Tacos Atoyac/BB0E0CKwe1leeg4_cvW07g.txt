I don't know why this place has amazing reviews. It has the typical signs of success: meager frame, limited customer service, few choices, and relatively inexpensive. The problem is Tacos Atoyac does not deliver in food quality. The hotdog was the best that I tried from the menu mostly due to the interest of avocado. The burrito was boring and really needed the sauces to cover up the dry meat. The sauces did not even come in a significantly spicy variety. Not what I was expecting and I must say I am disappointed.
