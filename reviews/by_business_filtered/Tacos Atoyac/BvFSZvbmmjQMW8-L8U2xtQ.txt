Tacos Atoyac is out of this world. And a total deal.

The menu is Oaxacan-style mexican; therefore, things might be a little different than you're used to.

The tacos, at $1, are served street-style with two small corn tortillas. Fish tacos (not yet on the menu) will set you back a mere $1.50.

The quesadilla, at $1.50, is unlike the quesadillas you're used to, but it's wonderful. It almost looks like a turnover pastry, but filled with queso cheese and covered in lettuce, cojita cheese and crema. Excellent.

My favorite item on the menu is the $2 milueta ($3 with meat). It's almost like a mini french bread pizza covered in the same ingredients as the the quesadilla: spiced black beans, queso and cojita cheese, lettuce and crema. They make the bread in-house and it's a must-try.

While I haven't tried it yet, tonight I saw a Tlayuda (pronounced "clayuda") come out of the kitchen and it looked tremendous. It was described to me as a mexican pizza of sorts, only served on a large, fresh tortilla that is crisped by a technique that basically dehydrates the freshness out of it. You can get it without meat for $6, with meat for $8.

Everything is served with a nice little side of grilled onions and a jalapeno. You can tell an amazing amount of talent, effort and fresh ingredients go into everything that comes out of the kitchen in this restaurant and I'll be going back frequently. Check it out!!!
