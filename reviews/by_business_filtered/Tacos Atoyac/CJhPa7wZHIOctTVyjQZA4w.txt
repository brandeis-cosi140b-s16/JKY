I had lunch here September 10, 2013.  I ordered a fish taco, rolled chicken tacos and something that looks like a gordita.

The fish taco arrived at my table cold.  I know what you're going to say, "send it back" but I was hungry and from what I've seen in the past sending food back usually gets you a food with something "extra", like a booger.  Plus, food during a lunch rush should come out fresh and HOT.  If it had been warm it would have only been okay.

The chicken tacos had a tough tortilla shell and the meat inside was also tough to chew.  The chicken didn't have any seasoning or flavor to it.

The "gordita" is covered with black beans, meat and some cheese.  It was warm and okay but was rather bland for my tastes.
