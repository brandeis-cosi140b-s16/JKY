I just left from here and I don't know what you people are talking about and this having almost 5 stars or an A inside the business. This smells like sewage all over the place I could not be inside for 1 full minute. I walked out I can't believe people can eat inside with that smell in the air. I ordered an al pastor taco since I was there and yup just like I guessed it was nasty. Tortilla was cold no flavor and small for I think 1.50 You people on here don't know what's good tacos LOL
