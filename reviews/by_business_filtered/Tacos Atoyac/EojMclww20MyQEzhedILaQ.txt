Got three carne asada tacos and a quesadilla to go.
The tacos were your typical street-style tacos like you get at, say, Baja Fresh. Two corn tortillas filled with meat, basil and onion. They were very good and the tortillas seemed very fresh. However, nothing really new there but also no complaints.
The quesadilla was unlike one I've ever had, seeing as it's Oaxacan-style. It's more like a masa de ma√≠z empanada filled with cheese and herbs, topped with black bean sauce, lettuce and another white cheese. It was AMAZING, very flavourful and something that I will definitely want to have again. 
Three tacos and the quesadilla was less than $7. The prices are very cheap but this is also street food - small and fast, so you get what you pay for. Definitely go in expecting to order a few different things at once. I definitely want to go back soon and try a few other menu items!
