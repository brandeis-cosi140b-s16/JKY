Drove all the way to this place just to eat lunch again and was not disappointed. The fish tacos, pastor taco's, black beans and horchata were outstanding. Best flavor in a taco I've ever had. Going to go back next and try a burrito.

Mouth waters just thinking about this place. Highly recommended.

Only downside is the parking. I found there is a parking lot in the back for ihop that isn't a far walk from this place.
