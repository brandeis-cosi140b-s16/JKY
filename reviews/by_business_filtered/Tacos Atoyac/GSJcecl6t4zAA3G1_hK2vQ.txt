This place is fantastic.  The food is absolutely amazing.  We had been meaning to try this place for a while and finally made it over recently.  The owner, Dan, is super friendly and since it was our first time, he was happy to give some suggestions.  I settled on the spicy burrito and my girlfriend had the fish tacos (she had a couple others too but I forget which ones).

The fish tacos were superb (she let me have a bite).  The others she had also had great flavors.  They were served with a variety of sauces and a side of grilled onions that I believe she said were the best she has had in a very long time.  I tried them and darn it, she was right.  My burrito was a good size and very tasty.  Dan had given me the option of how spicy I wanted it and based on what I told him they nailed it.  It was just enough to make me full but not so much that I went into a food coma.

Overall, the place was very clean and it is not a huge place.  We will definitely be back here and have made it a staple in our places to frequent.  They are not open on Sundays so get your fix in on Saturday if you can't make it during the week.

Highly recommend!!!
