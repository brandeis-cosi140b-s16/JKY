I've heard loads about this place, and until recently, kept putting it off to come in.  So I finally made it in today, and really had a good time.

For starters, the menu is HUGE. Loads to choose from, and the prices are awesome!!  I wasn't sure what to get, so I asked the guy behind the counter, and he helped me out with what to pick.  I went with a carne asada burrito and a drink.  Price total?  $6.01.  YES!!!!

Food came out quick, and I was able to finish it all. Meat was good, and I got a plate of peppers, onions, salsa and a hot pepper.  The onions were good, but I wish they were already on the burrito!  The salsa was tasty and not to spicy, so I was able to enjoy it with my lunch.

Place is somewhat small and cramped, with limited but ample seating. Definitely not for an extremely large crowd, but enough to seat a few people.  The one thing I wish they did was have a fountain pop station, as I prefer that to cans or bottles of drinks.  I didn't see one, and the guy at the register told me it was cans or bottles of pop.  But yet, I saw a one couple who had Styrofoam cups. where did those come from? I  hate to sound so harsh, but I really think he needs a fountain pop station in here, seriously. I'll pay a little extra!

Parking is a bit tight and its in a non descript location.  If you didn't know it was there, you might just pass it!  Overall, a great experience, even though the carne asada was a bit dry for me. Not bad, just a tad dry for my tastes.

Overall, a wonderful experience, and I wouldn't mind going back.  Great food, lovely time.
