Ummm YUM! Why hadn't I made it out here sooner? This taco shop is legit. The tacos were cheap and delicious. I tried the asada, pastor, and pescado with a shared spicy chicken tamale ... the husband got the carne rolled tacos. All served with a delicious green salsa. I liked everything we ate, but my favorite by far was the fish. This was no ordinary fish taco... it was not fishy at all and was lightly fried so it felt light and airy. The sauce and slaw were wonderful. I'm not a huge fish person, but I would eat about a million of these things... yum. We had all of that and a coke for 11$.... insanity. I will be back!
