The time has come to slip out of my Reviewless Yelp Coma.  The perfect catelyst for this was Tacos Atoyac.  This place has got it down.  First off, the fish tacos previously discussed were amazing, some of the best I've had.  They rival my long-time favorite spot, La Condesa, and are 1/2 the price!  The fish is plentiful and perfectly battered, and the sauce that comes on them is perfect consistency and taste.  

I've had the carne asada tacos as well, definitely hit the higher quality standpoint and I would highly recommend them.  After doing some perusing in the northern Phoenix area (usually on my modest lunch break), I can safely say that this spot will be in regular rotation.  Great prices, excellent food, and a nice patio area pull together for a great package that is going to be tough to beat.  

Welcome to the neighborhood, Tacos Atoyac!!
