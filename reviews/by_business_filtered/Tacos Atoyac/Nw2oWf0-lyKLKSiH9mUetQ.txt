Simple, inexpensive, delicious.  Not only are the ingredients fresh, the restaurant clean, and staff friendly, the food speaks for itself.  I was so impressed with the authenticity of the Oxacan food here, that I have been back for more many, many more tacos.  It's rare that this place is slow but when it is, I've had the opportunity to talk a bit with the owner.  He is so enthusiastic about his food, and it shows.  My usual routine is to order my food (I've tried it all, and it's all fantastic) then walk around the corner to the liquor store and get a beer.  By the time I get back to the restaurant, my food is ready and I eat.  Beer + tacos... It's perfect.  The menu is simple and the prices are great.
