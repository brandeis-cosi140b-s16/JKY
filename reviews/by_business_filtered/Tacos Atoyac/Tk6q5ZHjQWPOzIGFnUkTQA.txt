Once you have Tacos Atoyac, you never go back! 
Tacos Atoyac is our favorite "go to" diner for the hubs and myself. 
You seriously cannot find better tacos ANYWHERE! 
THEE best fish tacos around. My husband prefers the campechano tacos. He's also tried the campechano in a burrito and loved it as well. Everything we've tried here is amazing! 
Pinto beans are always perfect, as are the black beans. The tortas are delish. Literally cannot say anything bad about the place, except maybe they need a soda fountain. 
The different salsas are amazing but the guac is my fave. 

Customer service is always EXCELLENT! But the owner doesn't take crap from nasty customers (as he shouldn't have to). 

Prices are more than fair!
