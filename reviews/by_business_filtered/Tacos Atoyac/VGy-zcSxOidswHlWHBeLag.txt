Nom nom nom. I think that encapsulates my entire review for Tacos Atoyac. I've been there three times now (I wanted to make sure this place was consistently awesome) and each time has been delicious. My recommendations: absolutely hit up the fish tacos and the Oaxacan hot dog. 

The fish tacos are fantastic - lightly battered, crunchy, crisp and tasty (yeah for being well-seasoned!). Add a little bit of lime and sprinkle with the generous side of onions they provide and you've got yourself a fantastic dinner. The portion sizes here are a bit small, but reflective of the prices. The regular tacos are all $1. 

The Oaxacan hot dog - grilled bun, beans, lettuce, avocado, mayo, bacon and some other items that I'm missing. So, so delicious. The only minus is that they use a pretty standard hot dog. I'd love for them to use a better quality dog, but at the price, I understand. And the toppings are fantastic. Definitely try different things. The prices are very conducive to trying different things.
