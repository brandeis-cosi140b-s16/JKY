Was in Phoenix for spring training and went in quest of the best tacos in town.  Score!  Yes, it is small and in a rather funky neighborhood.  No the decor is not going to win any contests.  And this is not fast food; if you want your tacos in a hurry, go to Taco Bell.  You can absolutely tell that the guy behind the counter is VERY serious about his craft.  As a couple of other reviewers mentioned, the menu is very simple and posted on the wall.  There were a few things on there I had never heard of including a little fritter type of thing made of masa and stuffed with chorizo and potatoes.  WOW, two bites of paradise.  And I had to try the Oaxacan hot dog.  I am guessing it is not really a traditional Oaxacan dish, but damn it was good.  My buddy tried four different tacos and reported that they were all excellent.  Oh, and I asked the guy what the must eat item was on the menu, to which he replied "Fish Taco"  Best fish taco I have ever had.  Period, hands down, no argument.  So do not take your prom date here (or if you can take your prom date to a place like this, marry her!)  Take your appetite and appreciation for simple food done right.
