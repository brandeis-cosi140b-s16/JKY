I am going to preface this by first saying that I cannot stand hot dogs. However, after seeing the pictures of the Oaxaca dog I just had to try one. It was SO delicious. I loved the crispy bacon that was in it. My husband had their menudo and said it was okay, but not much can compare to how his mom made it when he was little. My daughter, who normally orders only frijoles y arroz at every Mexican food restaurant, was "forced" to order something else too. She got one of the fish tacos, as plain as possible, and ate the fish out of the inside...then she proceeded to go order two more at which time she declared that it was "so good it's torture." I also ordered two fish tacos (my first time ever to have fish tacos as my staple is carnitas) and all I can say is...Oh. My. God. They were so yummy! Now my daughter has declared that that is her new favorite restaurant and we have to go again. And to top it off, the guy taking our order was very friendly and the place was nice and clean. Definitely going to go again.
