Aahhh the hotdog!! It was YUMMINESS.  It's kinda scary on a Friday night as it's wedged between a smoke shop and another shady looking place but well worth it.  They have amazing fish tacos and a great Oaxacan hotdog (try it, it's better than you think) Since all of the items on their menu are pretty cheap you can order a bunch of random stuff to try and still be within the price of an average meal. Love that they have small street style tacos so I can have a good sampling of the meats. Don't forget to get a Molote (meat wrapped in masa harina and friend to perfection. They dress it like a taco and it's....soooo good!) My boyfriend loves the horchata and I like the mexican sodas and how cheap everything is. The decor is no frills but the friendliness of the staff and the amazing food more than make up for it.  This is definitely one of my new favorites!
