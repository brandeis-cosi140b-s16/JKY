Picked up a bunch of tacos to go, different kinds. Grabbed a couple of tamales, too. Dealt with the jacked up traffic and headed home. When I got home and unpacked everything the food was barely lukewarm (due to traffic - not the restaurant).

Tamales were BIG. Everything was so good we couldn't waste time reheating anything! 

Place was packed. Probably due to us Yelpers. ;)
