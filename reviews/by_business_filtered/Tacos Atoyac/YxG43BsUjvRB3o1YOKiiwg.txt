Tasty TINY tacos that are inexpensive in a VERY NO FRILLS repeat very no frills   atmosphere. You order at the counter and they run the food to you. Between us we tried four different ones that were all seasoned differently. They were all tasty and good. The fish ones came on a very thin fresh tasting flour tortilla and the others came on double stacked corn tortillas .I heard they are Oaxaca Style. I tried to find out what Oaxaca is but the only information I found was that Grasshopper Tacos are popular in Oaxaca and mole sauces are popular there. I've had real street tacos on the streets in Mexico but they were Jalisco and did differ in taste so I can't compare them . They gave us small sides of thin avocado based sauce , green salsa , grilled onions and an inedible super hot roasted chili pepper that looked like a Serrano to me but might have been a jalape√±o. Unfortunately my husband took a bite out of the pepper and started hiccuping. I just tasted without eating the tiniest piece and my lips swelled up like balloons because it really was that hot . The pinto beans were very runny like soup but tasty and had an unexpected cheese surprise at the bottom of the dish.

A bottled water five tacos and a side of beans was less than $12. before tip.
