I just moved to Scottsdale from San Francisco four months ago and I've been pretty disappointed overall with the selection of food and the worst servers in all of the country are found in this entire city. I'm a big food critic and a foodie and I am always searching for the best places anywhere I go.

Since I moved here I've been searching for a really good Mexican place and all of them have left me not even wanting to waste my time writing a review. Many of them are trying to be very 'creative' by adding ingredients that should never even have them to begin with! (i.e., it must be a thing here to have guacamole with craisins or some kind of dried fruit...that is just THE most disgusting thing I've ever had and to be honest I feel bad for these restaurants that do this). 

Tacos Atoyac definitely grabbed my attention. A true hole in the wall place, overall great!

Some of the items may have lacked seasoning, however they don't try to be creative. I do wish they offered a salsa that did have bigger flavor, bolder, and spicier. 

When ordering tacos, they give you a side of 'cebollas ahogadas' which are basically onions sauteed softly which is very authentic from a few regions in Mexico. They could have been sauteed a bit more but still very nicely done.

I heard from the grapevine the tall gentleman at the counter speaks perfect Spanish and seems to me he would be more than gladly to answer any questions you might have on the menu which is very easy and no bullshit either. That's great!

Overall, I would recommend this place and would most definitely come back. It's a bit far a commute for me living in Kierland, but it is definitely worth my gas.

Congratulations!
