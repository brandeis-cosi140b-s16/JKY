Oh my, oh my, how I miss coming here for the best fish tacos.  The fish is seasoned and lightly breaded and there is a good portion on the taco.  I have tried the crispy quesidilla and al pastor tacos, but the fish tacos remain my all time favorite.  

It's very simple inside and not in the greatest neighborhood, but the service is great, prices are cheap and the food is amazing. 

Come and get some authentic tacos!!
