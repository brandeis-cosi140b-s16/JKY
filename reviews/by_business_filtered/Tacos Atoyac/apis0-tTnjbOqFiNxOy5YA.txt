Me: Si...si...una lengua, un camaron, y un al pastor por favor. Y una Coca Cola de Mexico! Andale! 

Tall dude with mad tats: Siete treinta y ocho, por favor.

Me: Chingada! Es barato! Esos tacos son para enanos?

Tall dude with mad tats: No! Nuestros tacos son por el gente regular!

Me: (take a bite from the delicious tacos before me and remove 6 shooter from holster and fire into the ceiling repeatedly) Ahhhhh-ha! 

So, I didn't really ask the guy if those were dwarf-sized tacos, but upon hearing the cost ($7.38) compared to what I ordered, I thought I was paying for tiny tacos. For the tasty deliciousness that was my tongue, al pastor and shrimp taco with a Mexican Coke lunch, it was a bargain and they were regular sized tacos, not appetizer sized.

Dude said he always wanted a skylight so he let me slide on the bullet holes in the ceiling.
