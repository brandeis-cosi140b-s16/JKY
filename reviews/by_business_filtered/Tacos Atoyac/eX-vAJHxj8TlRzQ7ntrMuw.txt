I don't know what all the buzz is about with this place.  After seeing it on the news, we gave it a try.  Not impressed.  We tried the fish taco, shrimp taco, chicken taco, and the quesadilla. After all the reviews I'd read, I started to think we were in the wrong place. Whatever the lettuce/cabbage mix on the taco was, was nasty and wilted. The corn tortillas fell apart. The flour tortillas were awesome though. They screwed up our order, served people that had just shown up and before people that were there before us.  Won't be going there again.
