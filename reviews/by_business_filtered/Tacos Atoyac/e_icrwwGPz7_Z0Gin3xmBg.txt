If I could give it 10 stars I would. My GF and myself were on our way up to Sedona and we found this place from Yelp. The owner Dan is absolutely friendly like everyone has said. The place is small and clean. Place has only been open for 4 months so the place does not have much character yet. The food is spectacular. Big flavors and low prices. The al pastor is amazing. I wish Dan the best luck in his new restaurant but by the way this food taste he won't need luck. It is just a matter of time till this place blows up!
Will be making sure to come back next time in Phoenix.
