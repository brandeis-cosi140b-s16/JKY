I've been working in the area for the past 2 years and somehow this place eluded me until last week. Driving past the place the exterior gives off that muffler shop / used tire store kind of vibe, but you just need to have some faith. Park your car, take a deep breath, walk through the steel security bar front door and prepare to enter a world of taco nirvana. 

Carne asada, al pastor, fish, chorizo, lengua... all the great street tacos you had and loved in Rocky Point but were too drunk to remember. With the exception of the fish, the tacos are true street taco size so take the number of tacos you usually order at Rubio's or Baja Fresh and double it. Don't start complaining, these puppies only cost a buck.

I stuck with the tacos on my visit which were all excellent. A few in our group ordered tamales, menudo and quesadillas and said they were great as well.

Don't be scared. Go here.
