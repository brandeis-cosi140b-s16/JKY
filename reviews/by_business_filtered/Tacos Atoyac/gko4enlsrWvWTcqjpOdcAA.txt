I can't get enough of this place. Just go. It's kind of in the hood, but shit, if you want you can get a $10 fade and fix that bong that has been sitting in your closet in the same parking lot. Besides the fade and bong stem, make sure you get the best $1.50 fish taco of your life.

Amenities are minimal, but if you are not stuck on the glitz and actually enjoy food this is the place to be!
