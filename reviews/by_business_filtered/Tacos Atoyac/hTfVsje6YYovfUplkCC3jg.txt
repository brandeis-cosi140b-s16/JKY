Since moving here I've been searching for an authentic taco joint that reminds me of Chicago....look no more. Cheap, delicious street tacos. Our meal arrived with a side of grilled onions and jalapenos and plenty of lime wedges.

Fish tacos-Fantastic and not at all skimpy on the fish.
Memelitas-Fantastic. It's like a mini, thick corn tortilla topped with beans, cheese, cilantro and onions. I don't eat meat, but you could get meat if you want.
Quesadilla-Fantastic. Corn tortilla stuffed with cheese and herbs, fried, then topped with blacks beans, cheese & lettuce.

Aside from loving the food I liked the owner and the extremely versatile customers. I also like to support local businesses.
