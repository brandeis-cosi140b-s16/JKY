The food here is very good, I had it for the first time the other day while on a lunch break.  People told me it would be hard to find, but it was fairly simple, its right on the corner next to a tire shop, just need to pay attention as the tire shop sign is above the restaurant.

There wasn't much of a wait, the food was made fresh, and when I got the good it was delicious.  My only complaint about this place was the portion size.  I ordered 3 tacos with a side of beans and rice, when I got my food it looked more like an appetizer.  

I will come back to this place however I need to find something from here that is more MAN SIZED.

Also i'd like to add that their salsa was fantastic.
