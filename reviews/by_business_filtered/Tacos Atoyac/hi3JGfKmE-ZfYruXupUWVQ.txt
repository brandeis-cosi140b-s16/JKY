This is one of those true gems of the area. The restaurant itself looks super run-down (located right next to a liquor store and 'smoke shop'), but the quality to price ratio is just ridiculously high. I cannot recommend the fish tacos enough. If you live in the valley you have to visit this place at least once. Maybe not on a first date though. . .

On a side note: my wife is basically a known name at this place. Her entire office orders every Tuesday for lunch. It started out just her, and then as news of how good and cheap Atoyac is spread around, everyone was ordering.
