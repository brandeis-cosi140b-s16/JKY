Went there today as a result of so many good reviews on Yelp.  Our experience was the same as many of your other reviewers.  My wife was reluctant to go there because of it's location but because others said it was fine, in we went.  The inside is really quite nice and very clean.  The big man who took our order was big and husky with a beard and tatoos on his arm but he wasn't at all intimidating.  In fact he was very well spoken and seemed at home in both Spanish and English.  We warmed to him almost immediately.
We got three different tacos which were the mini-tacos and they were very good.  We finished with a beef tamale each which were also very good but would have benefited from a spoon of chili on them but they were good just as they were.
The place was almost full and stayed full the entire time we were there.  We will definitely be back.  So many things to try and experience.
Great eating experience.
