I told my brother to check out this place based on the reviews seen here. He has been a regular since, but it took my coming back from an overseas trip to try this place myself. After I was picked up from the airport, my brother told me we were going there. I am glad we did. I tried their tripas and cabeza tacos and they have been among the best I had this side of the Rio Grande. The place looks like a hole in the wall, but, great things come in small packages and you really have to look past everything else and enjoy the fine offerings of this place. BTW, do yourself a favor and try the onions and Jalapenos that come with every order.
