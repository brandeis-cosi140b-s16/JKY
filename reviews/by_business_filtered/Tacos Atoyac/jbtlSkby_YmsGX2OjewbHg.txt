Tacos Atoyac are the best tacos in Phoenix. The fish tacos are amazing, carne asada, al pastor, lengua, you name it and they are great. The Oaxacan Hotdog is incredible as well. This puts other Mexican hotdogs to shame. The horchata is the best I've had in PHX as well. It has cantaloupe and walnuts in it and isn't overly spiced like a lot of other places. The location and building is deceiving, it's what's on the inside that counts anyways. The owner is super nice and personable as well. Give it a try, it will not disappoint!
