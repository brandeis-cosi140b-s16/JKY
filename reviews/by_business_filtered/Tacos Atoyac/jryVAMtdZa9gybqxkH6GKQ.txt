I've been here a few more times since my first visit, just to give it another chance. This time, I tried fish and chorizo tacos along with what I got last time. The tacos seem really cheap for the price but they are bit-sized. Delicious though. Greasy which I enjoy. The beef I have with this place is how little care is taken to keep the food together before they give it to you. It's a mess.  Secondly, the time it takes for the food to finish in the first place is quite long. 15 minutes last time. I was only one of two people there. I can't really give a much higher rating because of the issues I seem to have with the above. I'll maybe push it up half a star just because the tacos are better than the standard fare, but I'd like it maybe more if they'd knock 25 cents off the price.
