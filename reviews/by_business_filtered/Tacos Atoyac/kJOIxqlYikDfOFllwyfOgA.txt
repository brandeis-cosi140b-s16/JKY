Traveling back to West Texas for Anaheim, CA.  My kids and I wanted some tacos.  Searched on Yelp.  I saw Tacos Atoyac and its reviews.
 So we went and to our surprise, the tacos were delicious.  The tacos are served in your traditional small size tortilla.  Taco Atoyac had a large selection of meats to choice from.  I will stop again when passing though Phoenix and have some tacos.
