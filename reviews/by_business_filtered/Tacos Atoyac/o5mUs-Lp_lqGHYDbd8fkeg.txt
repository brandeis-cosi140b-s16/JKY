Wow.  Haven't any of you ever tried the street tacos @ Tacos Jalisco or Los Taquitos?  The amount of love this place is getting is unfathomable.

I normally don't write too many negative reviews - I like to promote and support  the places I like and leave the ones I don't like out of sight and out of mind - but I just got back from lunch @ Atoyac, and I'm pissed.  All you positive reviewers have let me down big time.  The street tacos had zero flavor and the sauces were lacking in both flavor and kick.  I sampled the chicken, pastor, carne, chorizo, and fish - and they all came up way short.  I'm not going back ever.

I will now attempt to theorize why this place enjoys such a positive buzz.

It's in an "edgy" location, and qualifies as a genuine "hole-in-the-wall" joint that people are just aching to love, regardless of the quality of the food.  For whatever reason, people want to love shit holes (BUT THE FOOD IS SOOO GOOD!!) and promote them to their friends.  It's really weird.

I'm embarrassed for all of you that think these are even good street tacos, let alone, the best street tacos in PHX.  I will end this review the way I started it - by suggesting that all of you go to Tacos Jalisco or Los Taquitos instead of Tacos Atoyac.
