I have eaten at Tacos Atoyac a half a dozen times and sampled much of the menu, but I always find myself going back to these three:
1) Fish Tacos
2) Shrimp Burrito
3) Crispy Quesidilla

Those three items make me a regular here. I have also tried the asada, pastor and chorizo tacos. They are small and cheap which is nice, but I don't love them since the soft tortillas are a little dry for my liking. That being said, the top three items I mentioned are 5 stars all the way and I am addicted to each of them!  It is nice that you get salsa and avocado sauce on the side for free.

I often find myself falling into a deep dark depression on Monday nights when I am getting a fish taco craving and I see they are closed as I drive by. Ugh, tonight may be one of those nights. :(
