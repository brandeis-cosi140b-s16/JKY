Taco lovers! I have found our Mecca!

Great customer service! Not many employees but the guy (owner) running the show gives you adequate expectations! 

So, our order came more quickly than expected... The beans are fresh tasting and topped with cotija (my favorite). Then I tasted the fish tacos. OH LOVE!

Love!

The salsas were fresh, spicy, and wonderful. I now have a go-to place for tacos! I spent less than 5 bucks and was full! 

I wonder if they can invent an endless taco... I'll take one in FISH!
