This place, although Mexican, reminds me a lot of the open markets back in Thailand that had the most affordable and delicious food. There were numerous employees, all very friendly and helpful. Since it was our first time there, one of the guys let us try a little bit of every meat (more like he handed it to us without question).

I tried five different tacos - the spicy pork (adobada), steak (asada), tripe, beef shoulder (suadero), and beef tongue (lengua). The tacos also came with nice portion of cooked green onion and jalapeno! Every taco was great and had the perfect portion of meat, sauce, and vegetables (which is something you will rarely hear me say). My favorites were the adobada and tripe. 

I also got horchata, which turned out to have INFINITE REFILLS. My good friend and I were ecstatic over that for quite a while.

Next time I'll try out their fries for sure.
