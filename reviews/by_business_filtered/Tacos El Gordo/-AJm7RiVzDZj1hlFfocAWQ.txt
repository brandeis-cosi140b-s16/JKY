We were there on Saturday night around 7. We knew about Tacos El Gordo because we've been to the Charleston location on many occasions. The Strip location is just as good, but not surprisingly crazy busy on a Saturday. There's no seating inside this location, just a tent with a handful of tables out in front. At least the tent has swamp coolers inside to keep it habitable inside.

The wait seemed interminable, even with five lines going at once. I don't know why, but it seemed that the kitchen line was stalled for about 10-15 minutes while they were taking care of something or other back there. Once the line got moving it went quickly, but the 15 minutes in the swarm of people, even in a partially air-conditioned building, was no fun. We ended up getting our 5-year-old son an helado from the freezer and let him eat it (yes, we paid for it, but after it was gone).

The wait notwithstanding, the food at TEG is great. It is usually worth the wait, though on this day and considering the extra delay, it was slightly less so. We did, though, have happy tummies afterward, so all in all, it's still near the top of my list.

Still, though, on a Saturday, I would take the extra time to drive up to the Charleston location. I doubt that the extra driving time would be any less than the wait in line on the Strip.
