Five stars for the food - it's phenominal.  But dont plan on sitting down unless you've brought someone to stake out a table while others wait in the line(s) corresponding to the tacos you want.  

(It's annoying they allow this obnoxious practice: the tables could turn over several times in the amount of time it takes to get throught the steak line.)
