This is probably the first time I have seen a tacos being sold in vegas... with the exception of your local fast food restaurant with their fake tacos. So I think that it was very smart of the El Gordo owners to have opened this shop here. I cam here in the wee morning and everything was pretty organized. It was crowded for the wee morning.. but this is on the Strip. So no surprise there.

I had the Spicy Pork and it came with this liquid green sauce that I wasn't so sure what it was... It already had the guac... so was this liquid quac? Not sure but I think this is what makes El Gordo special. The pork was season great and it's always nice to see a traditional taco place with their pork rotating on its skewer in front of the fire.

I don't see what's so special about Tacos El Gordo. The presentation of the taco was not so nice. and it was really difficult to eat because everything was just thrown on top for me.

My experiences with tacos have come a long way because of LAs vast offerings. I still prefer the traditional hand made tortillas and taco carts from the streets of Highland Park in LA.
