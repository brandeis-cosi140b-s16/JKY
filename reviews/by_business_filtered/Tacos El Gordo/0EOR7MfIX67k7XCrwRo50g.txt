Wow. That is all I can say....

Tacos El Gordo will knock your taste buds into an all out Mexican frenzy of goodness! If you want the best taco, get in line for the spicy pork that is freshly shaved off of the skewer. They top it with cilantro, onion, and a creamy cilantro sauce, and also pineapple if you choose--it is heaven in your mouth...seriously! My boss shared the news about this place and I have taken my whole family now! The carne asada is really good too--a little on the spicy side, but still great. It has guacamole, onion, cilantro, and a red sauce. The best part is that you can taste the flame grill on the carne asada!

I promise if you go to Tacos El Gordo, you will not regret it!!!!
