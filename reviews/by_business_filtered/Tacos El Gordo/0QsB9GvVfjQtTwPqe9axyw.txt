El Gordo is as good as they come. I wrote a review for the one in SD and this one is just as good as might even be better because of their excellent service. The service was super friendly and always had a smile on. I was really REALLY impressed with the way they treated us. 

I personally recommend Adobado because it is simply the best. Watching the guy knife off from the pork that is spinning and then grilling it on the grill until there is some crisp to it with their own made tortilla(which is awesome) and their home made guacomole sauce is simply AMAZING. I'm not even exaggerating how amazing it is but if you're not too into pork then....

I really love their Cabeza(which I tried to go to other places) and other places really suck and I thought it was disgusting. Simply they make the best cabeza which I never thought I would like, but it is just so good and drolling here. OF course, the other thing I absolutely love is Lengua. I don't think I had any lengua from other tacos joints to be this good. I just feel like you have the 3 choices which you simply can't forget to get and it's just so amazing.

I'm simply drooling from thinking about it right now but I'm just so far away. Oh El Gordo how i miss you so.

Perfect Drunk Food NOT TO MENTION :D
