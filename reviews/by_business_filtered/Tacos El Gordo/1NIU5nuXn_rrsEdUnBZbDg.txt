There are a ton of reviews that capture everything you need to know about this place.  Get the lengua, by far the best tongue taco I've had.  The pork is great as well, the sauce they put on for you is perfect, and the warm pineapple sliver tops off a great taco.

The Campechana fries (1/2 pork 1/2 steak) are a must, although they will put you to sleep within an hour of consuming.  The smoke flavor is very prominent in the meat when served on top of the fires, flirting with overwhelming.

Ate there 2 times in the same day, that should speak for itself.
