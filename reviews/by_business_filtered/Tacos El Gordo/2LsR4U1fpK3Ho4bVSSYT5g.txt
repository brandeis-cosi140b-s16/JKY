Tacos are yummy.  The al pastor tacos are my favorites.  Service is painfully slow.  If you want a taco asada and taco al pastor, you have to stand in 2 lines.  You will easily spend an hour and a half in line.  So for that reason, this place fails.  Probably won't be coming back unless its at an unusual hour to avoid the lines. So the verdict?  Great tacos, but not good enough to spend hours standing in line.
