As a lifelong lover of the TJ taco, this place( hands down) is the best in all of Nevada.Tacos El Gordo will knock your socks off! Every taco is hand crafted from the finest ingredients. Depending on what protein you want, you line up at the appropriate station. I am a big fan of their adobada. Spit roasted pork seasoned with chile and pineapple. That of course in served on top of a made in front of your face tortilla. I get mine "con todo"which means with a sprinkling of diced onion and cilantro with a drizzle of their house salsa and liquid magic green sauce ( a avocado/pineapple aoli) FOOD HEAVEN.Want to be WOWed? Try the Campachana fries. What is champachana fries you ask? They are basically shoestring fries with an Adobada taco on top.
