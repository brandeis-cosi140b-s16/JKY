I had HIGH expectations when I came but disappointed after trying the food. 

- Carne asada meat tasted way too smoky 
- Carne asada fries are not worth $10! Lacks pico de gallo. Albertos/Albatras/Alertos are way better! 

+ Only meat that was good was abodaba

Tips
*There are different lines for the meat 1) asada 2) adobada 3) lengua, cabeza, etc. 
*Grilled peppers & onions are free, just got to ask for it. 
*You might be able to order some carne asada tacos in the abodaba line (just ask the worker if you can add it to your order)
