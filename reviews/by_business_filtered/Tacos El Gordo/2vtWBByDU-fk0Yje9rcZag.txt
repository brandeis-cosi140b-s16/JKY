As soon as you step in, the smell of oil and taco smoke was overpowering. I took my order to go, there was just no way I can eat comfortably inside the restaurant without chocking on smoke. The cool thing is that they make the tacos right in front of you. Our taxi diver spoke very highly of this place so we decided to try it. We order tacos of pastor, buche, carne asada, and lengua. We ordered 16 tacos and 2 quesadillas for 2 people lol. However, customer services SUCKS! I wanted salsa and the taco people sent me to the cashier, then the cashier sent me to the taco people again. Waste of time. I ordered so much food and they were stingy on the salsa. Also, the cashiers are pretty rude and so are the guys making the tacos. They have so many people go there they treat you like cattle. As for the tacos, I expected more but they were just ok.
