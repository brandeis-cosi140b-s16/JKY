Oh geez, where do I start.  I've heard so much hype about the tacos here and I was excited to finally make it to the Las Vegas Blvd. location to get some to go.  There was no parking so my bf dropped me off while he circled the parking lot.  As soon as I walked in, I was overwhelmed. It was like a crazy zoo with people just everywhere. It was hard to tell where to order as there were 6-8 lines.  I grabbed a tray and jumped into one of these lines. I was maybe the 15th person back so it was a bit of a wait.  When I finally got up to the window, the guy serving informed me that the meat I wanted, asada, was not available in that line and I needed to go to another line.  Actually, he kind of yelled all of this at me in Spanish and after going back and forth for a few minutes I finally understood his irritated frantic pointing to the signs taped to the glass in front of him.  Frustrated and defeated, I slowly made my way all to the way to the back of another line and waited and waited 15 more minutes.

Finally I got up to the front of the line and it was smooth sailing from here.  I ordered 3 asada, 3 chorizo, and 3 adobada.  Once I got the food, I didn't know what to do since they were on a plate on my tray and I needed them to go.  I must have looked like a lost puppy because one of the workers cleaning up the soda machine asked me if I needed help and with huge relief I said yes, I needed these to go.  So he directed me to the cashier and said she'd put them in a to go back for me after I paid.  Done and done! I got back in the car and we immediately started going to town on these bad boys. I must say, they were amazing and worth every frustrated minute of waiting in line.   Can't wait to go back and do it all over again, except this time, I know what line to get into!!
