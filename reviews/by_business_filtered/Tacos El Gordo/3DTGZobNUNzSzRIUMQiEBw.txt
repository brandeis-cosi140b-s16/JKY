Best. Drunchies. Ever. 

Came here after a great night at XS, love how its located right next to Wynn!
The lines do get pretty long, i mean, cheap delicious food after a night of dancing is a must!

All their tacos are great! esp. carne asada!! Juicy and tender, I love how they cook it right then and there so you know its fresh! You can also ask for grilled veggies! Don't forget to ask for their hot sauces when you're ordering because they don't have a hot sauce bar. 
Their sopas are also superrr good. Would really recommend it!
BTW, there are different lines for different kinds of meat, and dishes so make sure to stand in the right line!
