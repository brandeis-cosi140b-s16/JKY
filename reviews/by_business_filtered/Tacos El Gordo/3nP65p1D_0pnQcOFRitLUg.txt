BEST TACOS I HAVE EVER HAD.  OMGoodness.  I am glad I don't live in the area because I would be here every single day...and as big as a house.  This place is right near the Wynn in a little strip mall.  Very casual.  

Let's talk about the tacos.  Oh the tacos.  We ordered the Carne Asada and El Pastor.  The Carne Asada comes with the usual onions and cilantro.  Get the avocado sauce...on everything.  It is amazing.  The El Pastor was cut off of a huge stack of meat roasting on a spit.  Then it gets covered in a red sauce and the avocado sauce and topped with onions and cilantro.  Meat is tender and well seasoned.  AMAZING.  

Yes, it's crowded, but that's a good sign.  If you have to sit on a curb, stand outside, or stand on your head to eat your food...do it.  The prices are great and you can get a drink with free refills.  Tacos El Gordo is truly a gem in an area where prices are ridiculously expensive, the price for one taco is about $2.   I ordered four tacos and had to go get another one even though I was full.  It's that good.   

My recommendation?  Run, don't walk to Tacos El Gordo.  I would if I could.
