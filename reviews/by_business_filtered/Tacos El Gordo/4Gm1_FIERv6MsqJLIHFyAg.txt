I am so happy that I found this place. Located just down the street from Circus Circus at the end of the Las Vegas strip stands Tacos El Gordo. This is a real down to the basics taco joint. You've got the traditional carne asada but also head and tongue. We got the Asada along with their fries which is covered in asada and guacamole. Delicious! This is perfect for a quick snack or even better after a late night out. Will gladly go here again next time we are in Vegas.
