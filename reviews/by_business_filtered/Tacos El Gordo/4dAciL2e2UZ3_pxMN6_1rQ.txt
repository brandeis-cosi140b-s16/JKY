Drunk food at it's finest. When you find yourself leaving the Encore at 3am, have a hankering for some recovery food, this is the logical place to swing by. The place was packed. No surprise there, most of the people there were in the same state as we were. Between the three of us, we managed to order enough food to sample a small portion of the menu. I tried to order chicken tacos, but to my surprise, they don't have chicken. I'm not a huge fan of pork, so this left steak tacos for me. My girlfriend had the adobada tacos, grilled jalapenos and we all shared the carne asada fries. The table favorite was the fries. All 3 of us have been talking about them since. I now have a go to place when I'm in the area, those fries are going to haunt me.
