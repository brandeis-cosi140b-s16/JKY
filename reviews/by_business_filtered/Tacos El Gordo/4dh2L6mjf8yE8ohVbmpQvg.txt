sadly, the Tacos El Gordo near the strip has closed down so we have to go here for the heavenly tacos. I rated it down one because we waited an hour and a half for our tacos. It was hell while my legs and back were killing me but when I tasted it, all my regrets went away. The seatings are super limited and very cramp cause there is a line in each section. 

I also have found a new favorite: Vampiro. So good. I think I'll be getting that next time I go there. A crunchy outside, with awesome adobada meat, topped w/ other ingredients that just went so well together. Also they gave us grilled pineapple which was amazing when you eat it w/ the adobado tacos. 

Still love the place, just it's a lot more cramp and the wait is horrendous.
