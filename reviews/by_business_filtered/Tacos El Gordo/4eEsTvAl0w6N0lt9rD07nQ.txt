YUMMAYYYYYY.

SOOO great for drunchies. It's literally across the street from the Wynn/Encore, so super easy to access. The best part is that the food is DELISH and CHEAP!

There was a short line when we went, on a Thursday night around 1am (I know - I'm old now, can't hang!), but well worth it! Yummmmmmmmsssss.
