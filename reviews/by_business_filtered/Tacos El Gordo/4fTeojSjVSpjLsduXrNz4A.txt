I think the ratings are a little skewed on this place. Unless you grew up eating this sort of disgusting crap, then you will not like this place. There is no chicken, fish, ground beef, vegetables, rice or beans. What they have is: beef brain, tripe, lengua (tongue) and some sort of fatty pork cut from a large skewer, and a few other combinations of these. Maybe this is authentic Mexican tacos, but the average AMERICAN diner will probably not be happy. Yes the tacos are 2 dollars, but hey are very small. The average male would probably want 4 to 6 tacos.
