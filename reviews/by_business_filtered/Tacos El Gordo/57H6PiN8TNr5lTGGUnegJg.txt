Wait a sec.....didn't they MOVE?! My daughter INSIST we go here EVERYTIME she comes into town, matter of fact as SOON as her plane lands! Sooo...We go there, XMAS eve, 11 am, and it was totally closed down!! An employee next door at the gift shop happened outside and told us that they'd move because the rent went up!! I was like REALLY a, as many freaking tacos etc, that they were selling all day and every night?!?! Unbelievable!
She and I both were totally dissappointed!! They'd moved according to the lady on Charleston and Bruce. So of course...OFF WE WENT!!! 
That's another review tho....
I'm still confused becus Im looking at recent reviews for THIS location...somebody tell me...WTH  is UP?!?

OKOKOK...nevermind!! Once I posted THIS Yelp revealed the new location on Losee Rd!! YIPPEEE...that's way closer to home!!
Lemme go back and add 5 stars!! 
Just ONE complaint.....WHY! Won't somebody give its customers a better flow to buy these yummy tacos?!? First of all, I can't read Spanish...and mainly, WHY SO MANY DANG LINES?!?!? That's just crazy, going to different lines for different items is freakin ludicris!!!
