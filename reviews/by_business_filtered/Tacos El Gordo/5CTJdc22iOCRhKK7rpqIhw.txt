Om om om... The only reason I did not give them 5 stars due to price and limited seating. But anyway, back to taco love land.. Amaz.. yes indeed. As you wait in your line of choice (each line has a designated list you can choose from of meats). You can order quesadillas, mullas, tacos, vampiros... with any meat of choice depending on your line of choice. As you wait you will notice fresh corn tortillas are being made and the meat sizzling on the burning grill. As you order you place your order with the man that chops the meat on the block and preps your order to your liking in a matter of seconds. If you ask for the everything you will get cilantro, chopped onions, salsa and guacamole.. mmmhmmm. You place your order on your tray and then walk over to the cashier, who they makes the count and charges your per item. She also is in charge of drinks, and if you want extra salsa (free) you request from her. As you head for the door to eat, don't forget to grab your limes, radishes and salt or pepper. As I mentioned earlier, depending on the time of day, you might not be able to find seating. THis is located in an older center north of the Wynn hotel, right next to some souvenir store. Definitely on my list of stops when in Vegas.
