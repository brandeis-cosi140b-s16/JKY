I make it here every time I go to Vegas. Prices are reasonable, and the tacos are authentic. They have different lines for the different type of meats so make sure that you get in the right line. I saw someone get in the wrong line and had to move and start over again. The people making the tacos were pleasant to deal with. The location and condition of the building is not the greatest. In fact, it's really run down, and they don't have air conditioning, but if you can live with that, the tacos are delicious.
