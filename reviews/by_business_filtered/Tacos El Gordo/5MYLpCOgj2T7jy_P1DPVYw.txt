ERRRRMAHHHGERRRDDD!!!!

Came here with a drunk friend. Yeah, I had to babysit and he was craving tacos. Mini tacos. I don't even know how to explain the deliciousness of these tacos!!! I had the lengua, adobada, and carne asada. Yum, yum, yummy!

Best part is that you can bring in alcohol. They give you a brown bag to put it in (I know, how classy is that). Beer + tacos = YUM!!!

DO: bring someone who speaks spanish to order for you so they won't mess up your food.
DON'T: be belligerent and drunk and be all over the place.
