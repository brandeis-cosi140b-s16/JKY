I haven't been to their location in San Diego, but this place is LEGIT. SOOOOOOO BOMB. Worth the wait in line for sure. Forget about the buffets, the PHO joints off the strip, forget all of it! Tacos El Gordo FTW!!!! 

I ordered carne asada and spicy pork my first time and after having the spicy pork, I completely forgot about my carne asada taco. The carne asada fries are also delicious. 

I just stated salivating thinking about these tacos and fries.
