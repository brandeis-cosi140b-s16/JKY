I was really skeptical when people were telling me that these we're the best tacos they've ever eaten.  I have had some of the best tacos all over California and these are hands down the best pork adobada tacos period.  

Our group also ordered carne asada quesadillas and asada fries.  The "quesadilla" comes out as a 3" round?  It was odd size and small but tasted delicious nonetheless.  Their carne asada fries, tasted fine and the portion was huge.  But the star of the day was the adobabda tacos.

It's a great spot for lunch or for a late night eat after a bar or club.  It is within walking distance from Encore/Wynn.  Be careful if you want multiple items from the menu.  There are different lines for the multiple items offered so be prepared to wait in multiple ones especially if there is a wait.
