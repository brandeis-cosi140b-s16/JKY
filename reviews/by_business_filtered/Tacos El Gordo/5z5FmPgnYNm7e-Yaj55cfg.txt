Tacos El Gordo
The Lengua(tongue) Fries  1/2 order is the best bang for your buck. 6 bucks! 
Tacos are decently size, a little high on the 2 dollar side cause im a cheapskate, however 3 tacos will make you content. 

Most tacos 2.00 a taco, tongue 2.25, line is a huge mess, order first pay later. free guac.

GUAC IS FREE, ASK FOR THAT $%^. Cow Brain taste exactly like monkey brain, soft and fatty. I love tongue, but the way I cook it it tends to be more chewy like you're eating ligaments. I felt as if they kind of over cooked it but im sure thats just how they prefer tongue. Cow head just taste like any other meat. I should have tried the spicy shoulder pork, oh well next time!
