Cheap and delicious! The lengua (beef tongue) and adobada (spicy pork) tacos stand out compared to the other offerings.  This is a legit Mexican place....none of this chicken taco shenanigans.  Just the scary stuff and pork/beef! I ordered for me and the BF...but before he got there I ended up eating his tacos too....3 is not enough even for a little Asian girl....so make sure you order plenty!
