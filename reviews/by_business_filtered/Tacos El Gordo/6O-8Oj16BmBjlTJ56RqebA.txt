Finally authentic Al Pastor here in Vegas.

I worked in Mexico and then moved to Vegas 16 years ago.  I have searched the entire city since then to find true Mexican "street" tacos.  El gordo has them.  Fantastic Pastor, Asada, y Lengua tambien!

Roasted chilies and green onion at the end of the counter is a nice touch.
