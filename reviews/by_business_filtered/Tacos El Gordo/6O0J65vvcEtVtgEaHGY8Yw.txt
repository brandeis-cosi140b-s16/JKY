The spicy pork taco was the BOMB DIGGITY YO for real!! The Carne Asada is also yummy, one of the better ones we have had.  We were pretty lost on the line/ordering process, and might have cut a few people shuffling around to get our tacos, but they churn them out so fast, no one got too screwed over by our newbee butts.  The grilled peppers are great along side the tacos.  My only complaint is that the guy doing the pork tacos didn't help explain where we needed to order the rest, so we kept asking for our carne asada from him... basically he helped us look even more silly :)
