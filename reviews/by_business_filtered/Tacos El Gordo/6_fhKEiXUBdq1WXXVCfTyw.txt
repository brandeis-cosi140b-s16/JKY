Was in Vegas during July 13th weekend and came here twice during my visit. This place is outrageously delicious! I cannot fathom how good it is. The carne asada was so tender. Their carne asada fries is seriously the best I ever had! Get that with everything on it. I don't even like sour cream but it was yummy on the fries. Gosh I miss it. And I also tried the beef head and brain, which my bf got && that was my first and last. It's just too soft to eat.
