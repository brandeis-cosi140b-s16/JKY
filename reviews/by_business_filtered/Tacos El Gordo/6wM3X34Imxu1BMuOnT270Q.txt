Just like some of the best places to eat in Tijuana Mex. This place it the real deal. Head up ! The ordering food deal is just like Mexico too. Crazy! Especially when it gets busy. If it's going to be your 1st time don't go at prime time lunch or dinner. There are 4 windows to order from as far as I could see. Pork, Beef ( different part of the cow are offered) but no chicken. I found this odd but what they do serve it very good.
