Oh. My. Goodness. These Tacos are AMAZING. Like if you are going to eat at ONE PLACE while you're in Vegas... PICK THIS ONE!!!

The guys serving up the food are so friendly and will give you grilled pineapple if you tip them. (I know from experience haha)

It's a hole in the wall kind of place and it is always packed but with good reason. The food is unbelievable!!!

Make sure you order a MULAS with Spicy Pork. It is like a cheesy quesadilla with spicy/delicious/fresh pork and amazing toppings. I don't even know half of the ingredients that came on my tacos but WOW THEY WERE GOOD!!

Super cheap too. I would eat here every day if I could.
