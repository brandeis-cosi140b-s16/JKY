My favorite place to go especially after a late night out being that they are open till 3am on the weekdays and 5am on the weekends (Fri/Sat).  

The adobada is extremely popular and usually has a long line but don't forget about the lengua or cabeza which are my personal favorites.  All of the tacos are very fresh being that they do so much business it feels like you're ordering "Ã  la minute" and range from $2.00-$2.50 each.  Must get is also the grilled green onions and jalapenos which are complimentary for your order.
