This taco spot is legit especially in the heart of Las Vegas.  I can't believe I never seen this place, maybe because I'm always stuck at Palazzo gambling.  I do recommend there Spicy pork tacos.  They even have hardcore security guards on busy days to keep the business running.  They were nice though.  There are separate lines for what type of meat you want.  And I know the Spicy pork line is always the longest.  Tacos are 2 bucks and carne asada fries are 10 bucks.  I had 4 tacos and I was satisfied.
