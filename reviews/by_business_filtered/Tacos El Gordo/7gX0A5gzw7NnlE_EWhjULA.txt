I've tried all their $2 tacos from the meathead, brains to the spicy pork and tripe. I have no complains about this joint. Affordable and your taste buds screams for more!! You will leave with a satisfied hunger and a happy wallet!! I will definitely be back! (I've been here twice in the past 24 hours already) and you got to love their hours of operation. Can't get any better than this when you had a few drinks with the company of wonderful people/family & an appetite for really good food after drinking for a few hours :) Totally worth the drive regardless which part of town you live at even for visitors!!

I always get everything on it especially the pineapple slice with the spicy pork taco!
