found this place using Yelp. this place is always busy for a good reason. the tacos are great and for a fair price for being on the strip. the only thing is that the lines are confusing.  Depending on what type of meat you want you have to stand on different lines. it is more confusing when you don't know where to pay especially with the amount of people ordering food. sitting is easier to find outside in the heat then inside. I still recommend this place. great food.
