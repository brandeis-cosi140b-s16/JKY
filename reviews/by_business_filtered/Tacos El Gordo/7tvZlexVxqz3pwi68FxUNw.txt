When I first came here, the area was pretty sketchy. Ordering my food was a bit chaotic because there are certain lines you have to stand in for certain foods, so that whole process was a bit confusing. When I finally was able to order my food, the cook making my food was so nice. He made my tacos quick and precise, it was pretty cool watching him throw guacamole and salsa  in the air and having them land perfectly on my taco. I would definitely recommend my friends to this place. Cheap and delicious food.
