Very frustrating ordering process (check out signs and lines......gotta get in the right line for different types of meats, fries, drinks).  Weird.  But awesome food.  Wow, and I know real mexican taste and this is it.  Well worth the effort to get your order places and paid for.  Will go back, for sure!
