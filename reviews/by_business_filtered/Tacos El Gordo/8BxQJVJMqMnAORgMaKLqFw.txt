Did not have a mind blowing experience this time around.

I was really excited to introduce this place to the husband so we came for lunch. We ordered 6 tacos adobadas con pinas. Apparently some guy ordered a mula  (the workers call it "mulita" though)  but ended up not wanting it, so we got coaxed into ordering this mula because they offered us extra meat (ugh, I'm so easy sometimes). 

We bit into the tacos and the meat was flat. There was no tantalizing of the tastebuds. I was embarassed about my ravings. It was definitely their "off" day. Then we bit into the mulita and it was so salty! The saltiness was exacerbated by the cheese and the red sauce. It was simply messy dish and I would not order it again (even if they gave me extra meat, haha!) I noticed that a lot of other patrons had ordered mulitas and they were enjoying it. I think ours turned out to be bad because it was probably sitting out for more than 10 minutes. Ugh, why am I so easy sometimes!

Anyway, I'm going to give El Gordo one more shot and hopefully this time around it'd be as excellent as my first experience.




FYI: "Mulita" is used to describe these types of sandwiched tacos in the Northern States of Mexico, while they are known as Gringa in the Mexican south and are prepared using wheat flour tortillas. (Wikipedia)
