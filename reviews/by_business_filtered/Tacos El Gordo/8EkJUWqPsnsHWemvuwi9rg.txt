So goood that I went there twice in one weekend. Agobada fries are on par with carne asada fries in San Diego, maybe... maybe even better!!! Highly recommend any of the tacos and the agobada fries is a must!!

The fries couldn't be any better. They were crispy, covered with plenty of guac and sour cream, and topped with the fresh cut pork right off of the spinning pole. I don't know how to explain the uniqueness of the meat, but it was kind of a hybrid of bacon and cha siu (chinese pork). It was crispy like bacon and flavorful like cha siu. omgiwantsomemore!
