Coming from someone who isn't really a fan of Mexican food, this has got to be my favorite place for tacos! Every time I'm in Vegas, I have to stop here. 

Although the lines are always extremely long, I feel the carne asada tacos are worth the wait. They have two different lines for certain types of meats, so make sure you're in the right line! 

Give their carne asada fries a try too! But a half order should be enough for two people for it's really filling.
