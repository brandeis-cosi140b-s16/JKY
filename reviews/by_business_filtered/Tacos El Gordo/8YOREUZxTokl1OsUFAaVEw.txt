WOW! I wish we had Tacos El Gordo back in LA.  I came here for the first time yesterday and i was impressed.  

My boyfriend and I ordered al pastor tacos and I ordered a suadero quesedilla and suadero tostada.  The al pastor meat was delicious, and I love how they put sliced pineapples on their tacos it was the perfect combination.  Their Grilled green onions and chilles were good too! Everything here was fresh and made to order.  Even their tortillas were made from scratch.  Another plus about this joint was unlimited refills of horchata.  the drinks were only $1.40 the Al pastor tacos were only $2.00, the Suadero tostada was $2.00 and the Suadero Quesedilla was $4.00.   

We left Tacos El Gordo full and satisfied.  We will be coming back our next visit to vegas.  This place is amazing and service is quick and friendly.
