In Vegas last week on business. My friend who's a gordo was raving about this. I stopped by one night ordered the quesadilla, sope, and tacos. The meat was good but I think just a little to much in way it was prepared. Overall ok, but I've been to better places back home in Los Angeles. Try it out, all of customers
