I came here on a Thursday afternoon and ordered 2 spicy pork tacos, horchata and shared carne asada fries for 8. 

- BEST tacos I've ever had! SOO GOOD! MUST COME. 
- Spicy pork is awesome. they slice it right in front of you and put this delicious sauce! DROOL ~____~
- Carne asada fries are huge. a bit expensive, 10 for a large, so you have to share. A large in socal is a bit less, 8. Lots of guacamole. :)
- Security has a GUN! gangsta....
