Amazing super fresh tacos! They are literally cutting the meat up in front of you. Great pricing for being on the LV strip. Granted its in an area that might look a little scary to some people. I'd say go during the day, but I'm sure it's a great place for dinner or after drinks.

I can't believe it took me this long to finally try this place. (Because the other million times I've gone to Vegas)

I had the pastor and lengua. This might become a must visit next time I'm in town again.
