I have to assume that all those who've given this place 5 stars are eating tacos for the first time, or they're eating after a night of heavy-drinking, because TEG is as overrated as they come.

The tacos are okay, but they add all this sauce-crap without asking, and most of the time you stand in line for what amounts to a taco assembly-line, with the same care that goes into most assembly-lines.
And they don't have tacos pollo, for those who don't eat pork or beef (not referring to me by the way)....what's that about?

If you want a superior taco, go across the street to Taqueria el Pastorcito for their Al Pastor. Puts TEG to shame.
