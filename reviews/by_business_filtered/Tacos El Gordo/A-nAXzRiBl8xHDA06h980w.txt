Love this place! The spicy pork tacos are my favorite however, everything I've tried here (and I've had damn near everything twice) has been better than great.  the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean.  No wonder there are so many great reviews for Tacos El Gordo.  
  it can get busy and it's frustrating waiting on a table when some folks want to take their time and not get the hell out but this by no means the fault of the restaurant, simply a testament to their success.
