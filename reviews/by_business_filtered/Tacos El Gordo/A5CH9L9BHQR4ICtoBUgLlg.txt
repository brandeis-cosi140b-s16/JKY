Okay so I went to Vegas for my friends' birthdays and you know the drill in Vegas. But this, this was the highlight of my trip! Best freaking tacos I have ever tried and I am from Southern California!!!!!!!!
WARNING: YOU WILL GET FOODGASM FROM THEIR ADOBADA TACOS. It might be the best $2 you have ever spent if you love tacos. Order more than what you THINK you want. You won't regret it. 
I only got 3 adobada's and they were closing so I couldn't get to order more D:  
Their tortillas made from scratch is nothing like you have tasted before. SO FRESH!!! 
I want to go to Vegas just for these tacos!!!!!!
