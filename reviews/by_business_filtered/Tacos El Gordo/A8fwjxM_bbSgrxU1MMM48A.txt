Overall: still the best late night tacos


Pros
-abodabo
-al pastor


Cons
-buche is extra funky, not my fav here but others liked it
- tripa, again not a fan

Sidenote:
- if you like eating innards you probably will enjoy the buche and tripa
- if you are getting crazy amounts of food, be sure to get a tray
