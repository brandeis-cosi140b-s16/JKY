This has to be hands down my favorite place to eat!!  It's always crowded and you have to wait in long lines but it's worth it. My first time ever trying lengua and I was a bit freaked out at first but it ended up being DELICIOUS!!  I love the green peppers and onions, they compliment all the food so well. Best tacos I have had so far, I love this place!!!!  Just wish it was closer to my house lol
