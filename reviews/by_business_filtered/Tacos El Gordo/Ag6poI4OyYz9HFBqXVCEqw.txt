Its hard to describe how amazing this place is. I'm not sure what kind of sorcery they put on their recipes but this place changed my life. The tacos are out of this world the bomb. I mean, I'm from Chicago. Everyone knows we have the best of the best when it comes to authentic, local, organic and or  quality food. You name the country we've got the restaurant and its legit. However, this taco stand reigns supreme on any Mexican taco joint I've ever tasted in Chicago. Getting here was a blur. I was drunk and in tears from missing my flight that night. My cousin took us in a cab and it took what felt like forever to get here from the strip. According to my cousin they used to be located on the strip but I guess they relocated because they couldn't keep up with the demand  it was just way too busy there. We finally got there and the line was long AF. I was still drunk and crying so my cousin sat on rock with me outside consoling me while his fiance and my hubby went inside to order. After about 30 minutes in line they emerged with a giant tray of tacos, cebollitas, jalapenos and horchatas. We all drunkenly sat on the floor and ate with our hands like savages in the night. My husband said he saw an older woman making the tortillas by hand. You could totally tell the tacos were so good. By the time we finished I had sobered up about 20% and felt wayyyyy better. Just as we realized we were on the floor in the middle of nowhere, we started trying to figure out how to get back to the strip. Suddenly, a man in a security outfit emerged and started walking toward us. My cousin freaked out because he thought we were in trouble so he blurted out to the stranger in uniform " No Habla Espenol!". The stranger than replied in perfect English, "Sir, I work here I'm headed back to the strip, just wanted to see if you folks needed a ride?" We accepted his ride, jumped in his taco truck and laughed all the way back to the strip. Good times, good times.....
