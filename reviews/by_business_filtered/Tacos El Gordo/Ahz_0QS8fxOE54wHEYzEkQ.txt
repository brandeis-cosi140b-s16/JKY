Once I got over my shock that they didn't have chicken, I was ready to order!!  I picked the Mexican Shwarma ( as another Yelper called the pork).  So glad I did.  It was delicious.  Not spicy( I got the sauce on the side) and very moist.  The corn tortillas had the perfect corny tasty to them.  I only wish I would have discovered this joint sooner.  My wife waited on a different line and got the carne asada taco.  She thought they were really tasty too.  As good or better than a taco in Socal.
