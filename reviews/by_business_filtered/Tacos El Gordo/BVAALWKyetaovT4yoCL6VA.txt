OMG!!! By far the most authentic and delicious Mexican street tacos I've ever had in the US. My husband and I we're in Vegas visiting for the weekend and came across this taco parlor one night. They have every possible kind of meat you can think of: asada, chorizo, adobada, tripas, suadero, buche, lengua, cabeza and more! 

If you ever find yourself in Vegas, you HAVE TO check this place out!
