Great food here. Definitely the best I've found in Vegas and up there with the best I've had outside of Mexico. Just be careful when you order. If your pronunciation is not clear, you may end up with something other than what you wanted. I asked for an adovada taco and ended up with an asada. Not a bad substitution, but my Spanish isn't always crystal clear.
