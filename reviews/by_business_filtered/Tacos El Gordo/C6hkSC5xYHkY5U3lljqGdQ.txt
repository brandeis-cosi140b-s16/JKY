2 Asian girls and 1 white guy...that was my first thought walking into the door of tacos el gordo. I've never felt so out of place before, as we were the only non Mexicans there, but everyone was super nice. The adobada guy even offered us a sample slice. It reminded me a little of Korean spicy pork. I went with an adobada taco, carne asada taco and chorizo sope.
There was an assembly line with the first woman making tortillas by hand. The adobada was everything the yelpers said it was! Spicy, a bit of crispy, and not much fat. I definitely want to get adobada fries next time. 
Carne asada was ok, but not my fav. It was thinly sliced vs chopped like most Mexican places. It was nice and tender with good flavor, which was ruined by the awful pasty guacamole it automatically was topped with. The guac was pretty damn bad. 
Chorizo sope was good, the least greasy chorizo I've ever had with  Mexican white cheese melted on top. The texture was almost like a good mozzarella. I've had better sopes, BUT I've also had worse :)
Neighborhood was way sketchy, but Tacos el gordo was very clean, they had 2 ladies there just bussing the tables so there's quick turn over. Parking lot was well lit so I felt pretty safe there. It was great Mexican but I probably would only go back if I was in the general area. We got stuck in traffic for electric Daisy so it was over a half hour drive from my side of town.
