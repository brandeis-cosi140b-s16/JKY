Still very good the second time around. The TACO highlights:

LA LENGUA (beef tongue)
ADOBADO (pork)
CARNE ASADA (beef steak)

Those are a MUST. All super full of flavor, with that good salty seasoning tast. Very rich and tender in meat. The line is usually really long for the Lengua so you know it's good. I spend a good $10.00 for 4 tacos and a drink. I call that a good steal because really I tapped out at my 3rd taco.

I want to try their fries one day, but do beware as I heard that it is very filling even for a big eater. A GOOD PLACE FOR AFTER THE CLUB SOBRIETY FOOD and LUNCH TIME DROP IN AFTER A LONG WALK ON THE STRIP and IF YOU'RE BALLING ON A BUDGET.
