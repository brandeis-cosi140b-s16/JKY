Now here is a favorite spot for the late night clubbing crew....  

Tacos El Gordo runs all night long to cater to those party people who literally just got out of XS...... and are super hungry!

Be aware of the long lines!!!  It sort of goes quick but nevertheless it's still a long ol line to be waiting in...

Quick eats for after clubbing!  Which Taco would you like?

They are famous for the pastor taco!  Spicy Shaven pork on the spinner rotisserie is a crowd favorite!  But they also have tons of other stuff as well!  (gotta try their super nacho!  It is humongous!)

Here is a tip for all future visitors!  Don't just have your heart set on tacos!  From my personal experience, if you get just tacos you get smaller portions of meat!  Try the other varieties as meat portions are much much more than just simple tacos!

They've got free refills on drinks!  Including Horchatas!

You want sauces to go with your meal?  Ask for it as you are paying the cashier!  He/she's got it in a small fridge behind her!

Again, all sorts of meat options for you to choose from, and when it's real busy, they got both sides going at one time so it help speeds up the process!

To me... it's not the best tacos I've had, but the lengua was delicious!

Maybe the perfect after clubbing snack?  It's for you to find out!  Try Tacos El Gordo next time you are near!
