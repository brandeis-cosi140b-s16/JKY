The AL pastor meat if delicious........ the salsas everything is good ...... what really takes the 2 stars is that they dip the tortillas in lard. If the tortillas were plain with no lard I would of given this place 10 stars. I have been watching my oil, fat, and lard consumption and it is not acceptable and unhealthy to dip tortillas in lard to make a taco. Consider quesadillas With meat if u don't want tortillas with lard. But if u don't care to clog ur arteries  they are good tacos. Enjoy
