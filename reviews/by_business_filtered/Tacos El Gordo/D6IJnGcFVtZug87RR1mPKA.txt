LOVE THIS PLACE! I first found out about this place last year after a friend recommended it and have been going regularly to enjoy the food. I usually get al pastor tacos, which are so good! I also get some green onions on the side, which are complimentary, just gotta ask for them. The place is sometimes crowded, but the wait is definitely worth it. Great food, great service, highly recommend it!
