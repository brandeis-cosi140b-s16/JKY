Not too crowded on a Wednesday night, but wasn't too impressed with the carne asada here. It looks like it has potential as the guy was chopping and dicing right in front of you before he assembles your small tacos for $2. Did not expect guac on the tacos, but it was there in a dominating fashion over the meat. The meat itself was good in two of the three tacos, but number three took a dive and was unedible. The meat was undercooked, fatty and chewy all at the same time. All the other meats at this place belong on Bizzarre foods and the carne asada looks like it is very hit and miss.
