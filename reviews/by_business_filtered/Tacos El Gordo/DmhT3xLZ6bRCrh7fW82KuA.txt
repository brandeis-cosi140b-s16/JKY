Thank You Yelpers for helping me find this place. These are probably the best tacos Ive ever had, I live in San Antonio, TX and Id say Im somewhat familiar with street taco type places but considering all the high end expensive restaurants I visited while in Vegas, and the fact that the most memorable food I ate on the strip were these awesome tacos says alot. 

They added another side to the restaurant itself to make it bigger, probably due to its gaining popularity. The suadera tacos, adobada and carne asada are the best in my opininion. I wanted to try the Lengua but I was just too full. 

Im just glad this place has enough recognition that they had to make it bigger. They deserve all the business they get as long as they keep up with the badass tacos.
