5 stars ..not because this is a 5 star dining establishment , but because for the product they sell-it's 5 stars hands down!!!! I've been wanting to try this place for over a year and finally came..sooooooo tasty! I feel like I'm in Mexico! 
I had a Lengua taco, asada mulas, and a asada vampiro. All 3 were yummazing! Service was very fast & very friendly. The place was also clean inside and smelled goooood. 
I'm sold!!! Officially in love and will return anytime my taco craving hits :)))
