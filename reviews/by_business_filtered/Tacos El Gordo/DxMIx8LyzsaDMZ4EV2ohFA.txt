Nothing beats their Carne Asada Fries and their Abodaba (spicy pork) tacos. Its pretty cool to see the Abodaba chef strip the pork from the hanging meat thing. They work pretty damn fast too. Grab a tortilla, strip the meat onto the tortilla, put some lettuce, add some sauce. BAM. Repeat.

The one thing that threw me off here was that there were so many lines for different things. Whoever organized this.. didn't organize this. Theres a line for Asada. Theres a line for Abodaba. Theres a line for fries. Theres a line for beef tongue/tripe/shoulder. And... once you thought that was all done theres a line for the cashier. If I came here drunk/hungover I would not have the capacity/patience to take this all in. Which is probably some of the customers, since this is Las Vegas.
