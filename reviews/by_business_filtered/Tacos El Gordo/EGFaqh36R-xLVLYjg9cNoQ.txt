Me and my family have been to this location a couple times. It's been pretty busy each time we have been here but it has been worth the wait. The meat on the tacos and sopes we ordered tasted fresher and juicier. Even though it was busier, the employees worked pretty quick to get the line down which isnt always the thing, Overall, I would come back and eat at this specific location.
