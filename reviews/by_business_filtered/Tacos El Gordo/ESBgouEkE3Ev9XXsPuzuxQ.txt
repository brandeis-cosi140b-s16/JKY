Came here on a Friday night, the wait was not long at all. I ordered 2 spicy pork tacos. And my fiance ordered a half order of the Adobada Fries. This totaled to just under $10. 
I watched one of the workers shave the pork right onto the tacos. They were very flavorful. The pork was juicy with a slight crisp to the outside, SO good. 
I didn't try my fiances fries but he ate ALL of it so I'm pretty sure he loved them.
Will definitely come back.
