Omg hands down the best lengua tacos... Just the way they make them in TJ. It was heaven in my mouth. Lengua very tender & flavorful. Pastor could have been cooked a little longer for some crisp.  My husband gets his cooked well done bcz it's to raw for his liking. Now that's the way to go & it's super yummy.
