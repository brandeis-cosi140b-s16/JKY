When planning my trip to Las Vegas I did my usual Yelp scoping of the local food options. As soon as I saw Tacos El Gordo, I knew I wanted to go. Immediately I described this place to my boyfriend as the Katz's Deli (http://www.yelp.com/biz/katzs-delicatessen-new-york) of taco shops.

Just like Katz's, you get in line for the meat you want and watch as your food comes together. It is almost like dinner and a show. These guys are talented. Hand making fresh tortillas. Chopping and slicing meat. Tossing salsas and sauces onto the tacos. Those guys are good and they are fast!

I tried the adobada and asada tacos. The adobada was beautiful on the spit. The meat is sliced off directly from the spit into the tortilla. The meat was succulent and flavorful. The salsas complemented the pork well. The tortillas were just slightly greasy and cooked from the flattop. The asada guy was busy flipping and chopping piles of asada. Flip flip, CHOP CHOP CHOP CHOP. The meat was thin and chopped well. It had a nice grill flavor too. This taco was topped with cilantro, onion, and a light green sauce. It was good but not as good as the adobada. 

The place was packed on a Sunday night. There are taco shops on every block on Charleston so clearly they are doing something right!
