A long overdue return visit to El Gordo. Went post MNF / drinking at a local tavern - the perfect reason to get a plateful of tacos ! 

At first, didn't recognize the place - the store lay out basically flip flopped ! That didn't affect the enjoyment of some asada tacos, linguica, pork, etc. it was ALL GOOD ! 

why can't you be on the westside ,El Gordo, Why ?!?
