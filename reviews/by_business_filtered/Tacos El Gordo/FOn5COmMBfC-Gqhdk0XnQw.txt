This place was the highlight of my Vegas trip. 
This place is clutch. 
Every night after a  night of drinking I would cab it to this spot, have a feast..Then walk to my hotel for about 45min. No hangovers...And I'm hangover prone...clutch I tell you.

I'm going to describe the food with one word "phenomenal"!!!!. 
Best Al pastor tacos I ever tasted, always loaded with plenty of pineapple slices.

Love, Love, Love this place.
