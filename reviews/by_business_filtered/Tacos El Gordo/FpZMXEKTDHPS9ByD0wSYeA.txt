Went to this taco place on a Saturday and was not prepared to see the amount of disorder. 

They have 3 different lines but only sell specific meats in each line. I don't understand how this could be efficient whatsoever. 

For example if you want carne asada and pastor you have to get in line twice, and these lines are not short. 

Good thing we went in a group and we all split up once we knew what we each wanted. Someone was designated carne asada, another pastor and someone scouted for a table to sit because it was so full. 

The tacos were good but I wouldn't say worth waiting and going through so much hassle.
