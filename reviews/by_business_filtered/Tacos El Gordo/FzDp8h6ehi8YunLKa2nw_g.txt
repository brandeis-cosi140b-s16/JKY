My favorite place for tacos in Vegas! Asada tacos and mulitas are my favorite! Along with the guacamole they top them off with. Customer service was great. The girls where very friendly. The place was full of customers the whole time we where there. They really do bring the flavor from Tijuana. This is a must!
