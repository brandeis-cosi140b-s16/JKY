Two things I recommend:

1.  Tacos Adobada 
2.  Fries con Adobada

I love pork on my tacos and Tacos El Gordo does it right.  Adobada I guess is a relative to al pastor or is very similar hence my love for this place.  The adobada comes off a huge rotisserie, that they carve it off the rotating piece of meat and satay the carved meat.  The tacos adobadas are topped with this spicy green sauce and pineapples [if requested].  3-4 tacos are an adequate amount for a meal and a half order or french fries with adobada is a must.

Service is excellent - Make sure you tip them!

Best times to come - After lunch and before dinner otherwise it's a madhouse.
