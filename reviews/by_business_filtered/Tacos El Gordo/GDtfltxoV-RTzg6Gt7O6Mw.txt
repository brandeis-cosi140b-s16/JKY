Let me start off by saying that I LOVE this place. My friends and I always make sure we stop here and load up on awesomeness before we drive home. We were excited to hear that they were back open this time.  I was in LV, celebrating my 30th Bday with about 25 of my friends and family from around the US. Saturday night 12/12 we left the hotel to hit Tacos El Gordo, There were about 8-10 of us. We ordered our food, paid and continued to seat ourselves. Mid bite, we were approached by the police. Scared and slightly intimidated, he asked us to show our receipts. He said that the Cashier told him that we did not pay for our food. We showed all of our receipts and the officer was apologetic. No one else in the restaurant that night was asked to show their receipt. Why were we targeted? My friends and I are all professional women with careers and families at home and of course were very capable of covering 2 dollar tacos. I'm most disgusted in the attitudes and beliefs displayed by TEG staff this night. We were never issued an apology or anything. We were were racially profiled and it was humiliating, embarassing and disgusting.
