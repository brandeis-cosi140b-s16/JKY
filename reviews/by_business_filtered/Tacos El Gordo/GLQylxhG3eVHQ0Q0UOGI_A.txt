The tacos here are ok... not anything like the So-Cal Tacos El Gordo awesomeness. I love the ones in So-Cal, the flavor and taste is consistently bar none. But for some reason the Las Vegas location missed the mark. The flavor was off, meat had a lot of gristle, and some of the tortillas tasted a little stale. Don't get me wrong the tacos here are not terrible, just not anything close to what I've come to expect from Tacos El Gordo. Maybe it was an "off" day.
