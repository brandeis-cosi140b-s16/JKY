There's a rumor that you can ONLY get legit Mexican food closer to San Diego or ONLY in Mexico. Tacos El Gordo puts this rumor six feet under with it's authentic Mexican flavor and great customer appreciation! Advertised as coming straight from Tijuana, it's no wonder that Tacos El Gordo or "The Fat Taco" in English, is a taco above the rest!

Upon walking in, the amorous fragrance of the spices grab your nose and the various meats cooking make your mouth water like an infant drooling! Yes, it's just like that! My favorite spectacle of the restaurant is the BBQ spit that holds the fresh al pastor meat (marinated spicy pork)! I suggest the al pastor mula with everything (cilantro, onions, salsa, and avocado salsa) and suadero (marinated beef) tacos with everything! Make sure you don't forget the FREE grilled peppers and green onions at the end of the ordering line :)

Grab your limes, pay, and ask the cashier if you'd like some salsa. If you choose to get a fountain drink, I suggest getting a cup full of some refreshing orange bang (whipped orange drink that tastes like an orange creamsicle) and brace yourself for some filling, satisfying, flavor packed, and the most authentic Mexican grub this side of the border! Writing this review triggered my craving so I'm actually on my way to fulfill myself!
