I have been to the Tacos El Gordo in San Diego, so when we came out to Vegas I had to try it out. We were not let down! At all.. The lines are long but the cooks are fast and get the orders out fast. Everything is fresh and the place is very clean for a busy restaurant . I enjoy all the meats and Carne asada Mulas are on point ...Enjoy your meal!
