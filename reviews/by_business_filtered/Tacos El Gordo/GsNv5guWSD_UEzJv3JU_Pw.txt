First off...there's only two cities that have this restaurant. Las Vegas and Tijuana. I came to this location once & I'm in love!!! So happy my boyfriend recommended it!! Their tacos are totally delicious!!! The real deal; very authentic, if you want GREAT Mexican food. $2 a tacos too!!! Can't beat that. More reason, to rent a car, just to go to this place, because it is a little out of the way, even if your taking the duece. I don't want to waste any time getting there. I just wanna EAT!! I understand why this place gets so crowded. 

Inside, obviously gets packed, so its best to sit outside in the patio area. Ya......EVERY visit to Vegas, I'm definitely eating here...no doubt. You just have to check it out yourself!! I can't wait to try their other stuff!! =D
