Vegas has tacos ya'll. I repeat, Vegas.. has.. tacos.. y'all.

I'm not talkin' about your gourmet fish tay-co or the horrid generic ground beef. No, no, no..

Notice that big chunk of inverted curvy red meat rotating at a smooth, cool pace? She's with me. Her name is Adobada. She's pork cooking rotisserie style, beautifully marinated in a spicy 'red' chili sauce.. tossed on a corn tortilla, doused with hints sweet of cumin, a sprinkle of oregano, grilled onions and lathered with a creamy green salsa verde.  Ay dios mio! The perfect mixture of tender sweetness and spices that kick. Easily one of the best tacos I've had to date.

This isn't the only thing they serve, of course. What's neat is they have it set up almost like a cafeteria / buffet, in the sense that you can get in a line for an Adobada taco then walk over to another line and grab some carne asada fries. 

Thirsty? From horchata & agua frescas to my favorite.. Orange Bang, Bang.. Baby. Like a mother and her child, the drinks and food go hand in hand. Then into my stomach. Not the mother and the child, the food, you sicko.

The staff is pleasant, usually smiling and constantly moving.. This place is well kept and presented in a welcoming manner.  It truly reminded me of a few taco joints back home in LA, and that's a great thing! Amazing food, fair prices, up-to-par service and an alright location. Tacos El Gordo has the Nevada taco game on lockdown!
