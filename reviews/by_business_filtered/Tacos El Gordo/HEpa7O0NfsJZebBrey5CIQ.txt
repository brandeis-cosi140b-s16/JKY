best tacos i have ever tasted EVER! i tried the spicy pork, the vietnamese dish called (xa sew) brilliant idea to make it into tacos! So juicy & bursting with so much flavor. They had this spicy green specialty sauce poured ontop. $2 is expensive for a taco, but it's so worth the money! i also tried the steak but it doesnt compare to the spicy pork. & they didnt have the incredible sauce with the steak.
