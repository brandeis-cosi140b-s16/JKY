Excellent. I am from Omaha and thoroughly enjoyed Tacos El Gordo. There are numerous options for tacos (steak/spicy pork/etc) and all are reasonably priced ($2 a taco). 

Anyways, there are 400+ reviews for this place and it's clearly highly rated. I agree with this high rating and plan on going back here every time I am in Vegas.
