Ok, so I think I had really high expectations for this place because my friends hyped it up. We planned out all the food places to try and this place was up there.

So the first night we were in Vegas we were planning to come after a night at Hakkasan. We drove and got there about 4:40 and Yelp said it was still open but when we got there it was closed. Disappointment. So we tried again the next night to a VERY packed restaurant with multiple lines. The way everything is formatted is ridiculous! I have to wait in multiple lines to get different types of meat. So there is a line for carne asada and you can have anything from tacos to sopas to nachos but you can only order carne asada in that line. If you want other meats you will have to order in one line and then go to the next. 

After waiting in the long line you take your tray of food and go to the register to pay and then take a seat anywhere. The only good thing was that the drink was all you can drink of horchata and orange bang.

The guac was probably the best part of the meal because they put so much on the taco but the taco itself was only ok. Nothing special at least not for the way and how everything is formatted.

I don't think I would come back here again unless my friends wanted to.
