This eatery is located off interstate 15 freeway. This eatery is located within a small location and a gas station nearby. The location itself is bright pink from the outside so it is not hard to miss.


Upon entering, the line to order was not long, but the employees did not acknowledge you as their customers entered the establishment. Furthermore, upon deciding on the type of tacos one desired, one is to get in one of the three lines which do vary depending on the type of meat you would like on your tacos.

While getting in line, I looked around and noticed there was napkins on the floor with employees near by, but doing other tasks rather than picking them up. 


Upon ordering some adobada tacos, they were slices once off the meat product, but not re-sliced into smaller portions. I asked the employee to slice it into smaller pieces and he mentioned, there was not enough time for that as others behind me were waiting. I thought automatically, where is the customer service? 


The adobada pieces were long strips instead of thin smaller pieces of meat thus, making the food easier to digest.  Most places cut the meat into smaller portions so the meat is digestible.  I ordered two adobada tacos and one carne asada. 


They have a carrot station set up with chilles too and limes, but no salsa. If one desires salsa, they have to ask for it at the cashier counter.  
The salsa is free. 


After ordering your food, you head to the paying area with a cashier.  They accept credit cards including American Express. 


The place overall looked like a cafeteria style set up. The tables were not very clean and the eating area around the eatery was not clean. 

I don't consider this place to be a location to go out of your way for as I did from north Las Vegas, but at least I gave them a chance. 


Their prices are $2.00 per taco. Most of their tacos are $2.00 each with some $2.25.
