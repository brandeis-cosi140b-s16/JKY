Yes, I drive all the way from Long Beach to Vegas for tacos!  Why? Because my LV buddy and I have an on-going competition to find the BEST tacos on the cheap.  Win for Vegas!  I used to be loyal to Pepe's across town, but El Gordo is my new fave.  SO YUMMY!!

Carne asada tacos: A+++
Tacos el pastor: A+++
Service: Fast and friendly.  I love it when they speak Spanish to my friends and then switch to English for me.  Hey, hablo espanol tambien!

If you're converting from Los Tacos across the parking lot, the tacos at El Gordo might look a little small in comparison.  But don't be fooled!  They have five times the flavor and are super cheap so you can buy 13 if you want.  I get my tacos with EVERYTHING and they're delicious, but you can ask for no onions if you're a wimp (like two of my friends).  The tortillas are fresh and sooooooooo yummy.

We'll be driving back to LV for more tacos for sure!
