After a great concert my hunger was high, and a yelp search happen to come across a taco spot on the strip that seemed letigimate and authentic.....  Grab a taxi and request Tacos El Gordo. Right at the tip end of the strip on this strip mall location (across from a walgreens) we reached our destination I open the door and the whiff Mexico tacos! You know the ones you would smell when you'd go across the border before all the violence?! Yes! Those! 

The BF and I ordered:
      -a carne asada Mulita (it's like two tortilla's with melted cheese, guacamole, steak pieces, cilantro, onions, hot sauce)
     -Two carne asada tacos (beef steak tacos)
     -Two lengua tacos (tongue): super good, just the way lengua should be, be cautious of the green hot sauce which is flavorful but spicy! 
     -El Vampiro (this was similar to the "mulita" but the tortilla crispy/burnt like and I don't think it had melted cheese)


The tortillas are freshly made so the taste is delicious. Warm, not tough, soft tortillas.... Also note the tortillas are small.

It is very small on the inside but have more seating available on the outside. 

You come out with a happy filled belly and your long locks smelling like tacos.... Oh yeah and its extremely affordable. 

Hidden gem on the strip of Vegas when in search of good cheap food! I will definetely be coming back!
