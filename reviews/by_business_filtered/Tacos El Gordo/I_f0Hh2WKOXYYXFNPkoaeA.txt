Some of the best tacos I've ever had. I'm all about the carne asada, but don't bother with that stuff at Tacos El Gordo. Go with the adobada, hands down. The meat is tender and juicy, the avocado sauce is creamy and full of flavor, and the salsa has a decent kick.

I've been here twice and I'm only giving it 4 stars because the food didn't seem as fresh the second time around for whatever reason. The meat was a little cold and the fries were a bit undercooked. Also, they were a bit stingy with the meat on the adobada fries and they went overboard on the cheese and sour cream. Regardless, if you visit Las Vegas, try to make time to hit this place up. It can get busy during peak hours, so keep that in mind if you're running a tight schedule. The first time I went, we probably spent a good 30-40 minutes standing in line waiting for food.
