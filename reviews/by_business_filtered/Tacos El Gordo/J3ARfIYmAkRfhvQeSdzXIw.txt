Went for lunch and managed to beat the massive line that formed for al pastor tacos behind me. No line for the other kinds of tacos. I had 2 al pastor, 1 cabeza (head beef), and 1 lengua (beef tongue). All the meats were excellent. The cook making the al pastor tacos oiled up the tortillas so they didn't stick to the paper whereas the one making the cabeza and lengua did not, making it hard to peel the taco off the paper it comes in.

Quite frankly I'd give it five stars if it was tad cheaper and the tortilla didn't stick to the paper wrapper. Plenty of strip mall parking. When I was there I was one of maybe 3 non-hispanics among 50+ people. Everyone was real nice.
