YUM!!YUMMM!!!!YUMMMMMMMM!!! 

The best tacos i've had to date! And i've had a lot of tacos. lol. I had the chorizo, pork, and lengua tacos. ALL SOOOO GOOD!! My favorite was the pork... Juicy, perfectly seasoned, the salsa was delicious, everyone was soooooo nice, it was just overall a great choice for a late breakfast/lunch. Very good price!

There are many places in vegas to eat and i went to alot of food places while there and i can honestly say this is one of the one's i would religiously return to every visit. 

That is all!
