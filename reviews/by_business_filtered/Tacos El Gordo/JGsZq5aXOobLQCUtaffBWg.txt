Simply put, the best street tacos in Las Vegas!

The minute you walk into this place you will notice it is insanely BUSY, and that most people are on the pork line-- because it is the best item on be menu. Don't get me wrong, steak is also tasty, but the pork is excellent on any menu item. Here is what I normally order.

Campechana fries, half order. These fries are smothered in steak or pork, cheese, cheese sauce, guacamole, sour cream and their special sauce... Virtually a food group of its own. Beware you can probably share your fries with three of your friends and still eat plenty.

Pork tacos: I get them with everything and a bit extra of their green sauce--a cilantro based sauce.

Mulitas on flour tortillas: there are topped with the same ingredients as the tacos but the ingredients are sandwiched between two flour tortillas with grilled, melted cheese on them. Amazing.

You can have a filling lunch for no more than $10 bucks. If show up during the lunch hour be ready to wait for about 15 minutes before getting your food.
