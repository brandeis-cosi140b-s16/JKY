If only I lived closer! Best tacos in Vegas. The Cabeza tastes like bone marrow doused pieces of Beef. The Adobada is flavorful as well. With every bite came a sadness that the end of the meal was that much closer. 

The lines are long but it's worth it.

Note to management: open up a location in southwest vegas!
