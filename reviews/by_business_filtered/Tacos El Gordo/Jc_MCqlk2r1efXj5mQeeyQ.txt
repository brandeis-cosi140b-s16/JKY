BOMB.COM! This place is absolutely amazing and so worth the wait even at $2 a taco. Everything is on point. I will say I was disappointed with the quesadilla, but only because it's tiny and seems more like a taco; nonetheless, it was delicious. My favorite item was the Vampire on a tostada instead of a tortilla. In general, the tacos (pollo, carne asada, pastor), mulas, vampires, and quesadillas are excellent! The only item I wasn't too happy with was the taco de buche. I've had better and it's greasy. Some of you may not be pleased with the wait and having to battle for a seat. You'd be missing out if that's what is turns you away from this gem of a place. Overall I will take this over a buffet any day. Muy bueno ;)
