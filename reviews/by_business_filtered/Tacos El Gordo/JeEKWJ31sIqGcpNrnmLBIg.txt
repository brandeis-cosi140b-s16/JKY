The Pastor is legendary - that is why they have a separate line for just Pastor orders and another for all others. The other meats are very good - and they have all of the traditional Mexican meats, but that pastor - MAN! It is definitely pricey for small street tacos but worth it due to that succulent taste. Most times both the strip and Charleston location are packed at lunch so be get there early.
