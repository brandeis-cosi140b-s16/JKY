So we were told by boo's dad that we must visit this place in Vegas...so we did.
I can tell you that it is super easy to pass on the strip but it is in a plaza adjacent to Walgreens and they have little tents out front where you can sit and eat.

The menu is very basic, you tell the cook what you want and they cook it up right in front of you. I think I had steak tacos...I can't remember. I think boo had the same thing. They were pretty good but it was nothing exciting to me. I think I was still on a high from the 24 hour joint in San Diego. I guess I should have gotten the spicy pork tacos?
Apparently we beat the rush because there was a super long line of people waiting to order after we sat down and ate. They have soft drinks that taste like floats that are pretty tasty.
