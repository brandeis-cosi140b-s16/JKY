Easily one of my fav taco spot. Not a place I'd hang out, but definitely a place I'd get my food from. With that being said. Let's move on to the bad. The guy taking orders at the Adobada is without a doubt the worst ever. Rolls eyes, cuts u off as ur ordering.  Won't let u finish bcuz he just wants to move on. Only reason this place blows is bcuz of this guy. No point in complaining cuz the ladies there won't care. And I know bcuz an Asian couple did complain n it was nothing.mostly bcuz the lady spoke little English and was too busy to care. So u been warned. Good tacos, shitty service.
