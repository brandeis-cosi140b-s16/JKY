Tacos El Gordo is located near the end (or beginning of the strip, depending on where you enter), right next to Encore, sort of across from Circus Circus, and nearby the Riviera Hotel/Casino. Although it's a pretty unassuming location, rest assured you are in the right place.

Although we drove here from our hotel, I was able to find parking pretty easy. Your mileage may vary of course (we arrived around 9:00 PM)

For new patrons of Tacos El Gordo, things can be a bit confusing. There are actually three (3) different lines going. Two feeding into the restaurant from the outside and one on the inside which is closer to the restroom.

The two lines outside serve:

1) Carne Asada/Chorizo
2) Adobada (marinated pork)

The line inside serves:

3) Everything else

One of the staff members does come out from time to time to remind people which line to get in - if you are here for the carne asada, it's the line all the way to the left of the restaurant (typically the longest line)

After waiting about 40 minutes, I ordered 12 Carne Asada Tacos to share with my group which came with onion and cilantro, non-spicy red sauce, and a generous helping of carne asada and guacomole. I only decided on 12 because if they were really that good and I was still hungry, I did NOT want to get back into that crazy line.

Refills are free with purchase of a soda! A definite plus for me.

Tacos El Gordo also takes credit cards, another plus!

The Carne Asada tacos were truly amazing. Featuring flame grilled steak and fresh ingredients, this is the perfect food to have anytime or right after a night of dancing and drinking. I think I ate at least 10 of these tacos.

Tacos El Gordo is definitely popular for good reason. Whenever you see long lines it's one of two things:

1) It's awesome

or

2) It's overrated

I'm happy to report that Tacos El Gordo is awesome and then some. Cheap and delicious food, free soda refills, and takes credit cards? This place is easily a winner.
