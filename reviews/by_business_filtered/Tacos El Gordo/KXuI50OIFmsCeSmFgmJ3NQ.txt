My friends of Mexican decent say this place is over rated. I could not disagree more. It's been here a few years, it's always clean and the food is always fresh and consistently delicious.

I'm a slave to the sopes. For $10 you get 2 and a soda with free refills. I may not be from Mexico, but as for taquieria food in Las Vegas, none comes close to this place. 

With the exception of total demolition, tacos el gordo is the best repurposing of an old Wendy's ever.
