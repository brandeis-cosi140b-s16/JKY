WHY DID THE ONE NEAR WYNN SHUT DOWN.......
seriously though why!!? It was the most convenient drunchie place ever because of it's walking distance from XS.. ugh, so instead we had to drive all the way here!
Oh well, doesn't matter because the lines here were still ridiculous, even at 3am..so business must still be good.
I love love love their spicy pork and carne asada tacos! They already include sauces in them so that's why they don't have a sauce bar. Plus they include guac on them!!! That's 5 stars right there!
I also got their sopes but they weren't as good as  the tacos. I really like the melted cheese though!
btw, you can ask for grilled veggies! its free and goes great with them tacos!
