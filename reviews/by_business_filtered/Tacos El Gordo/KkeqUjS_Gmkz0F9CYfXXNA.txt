If you've been to Any of the other TEG locations before, then you know what you're in for. 
There's the counter, divided into lines depending on what meat you want. You can find me in the Al pastor, carne asada and the suadero lines
The lines here generally move pretty quickly, unless you come during rush hour, then it slows down a bit, and when that happens, if you have to go to multiple lines, it can really slow you down. A good TEG pro tip if you're in this situation is to get in one line, and whoever you're with can wait in the other one
They are pretty generous with the meat on the tacos. They are very generous with the carne asada fries. Like they just pile up everything on those fries, so thank you sweet baby Jesus. 
They come with the standard juice drinks: pi√±a, horchata, Jamaica. They are also one of the few places in town that I can get orange bang 
The only issue I had with this place is that the first month or two that it was open, they only had half the seat in area available, and that basically killed any chance of me eating there and not taking it home, but recently they I'd open it fully, so I'm much grateful for that. 
If you need some good tacos in your life, you know you need to get here
