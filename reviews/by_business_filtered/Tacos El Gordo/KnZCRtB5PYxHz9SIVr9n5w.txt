Seriously, all tacos!? Don't come looking for a burrito now... Unless, you speak the lingo and ask for Mulas (which is not burrito, but you get the double wrap)! ^___*

But the service was so so painfully slow! And the fact that you have to line up to different lines to get different meats, it really didn't help my dinner time to be any faster. It was so ridiculous that I timed my waiting in lines... it took 1.5 hrs to get all the orders in and by the time I sat down to eat? The first order of carne asada tacos was stone cold. 

I've had comparable if not better meats in NorCal. I am not risking losing 2 hours of my vacay time in line. So, the next time I am in town, if I am inclined for cheap meats, I will look at the rate of line getting shorter before I jump.
