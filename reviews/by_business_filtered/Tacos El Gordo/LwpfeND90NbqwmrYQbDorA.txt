holly shit I found them on yelp, and its the same mother fuckers from TJ! No joke! Some one actually loved the tacos El Gordo in TJ enough to venture up with them in Vegas. Well they taste almost the same except for the price of course, but who cares, I had the Al pastor/adobada and it was spot on, great tacos! Also had the AL pastor fries and they were damn good too! If you have been to the one in TJ you are going to love the one/s in Vegas. Best Al pastor tacos I've had this side of the boarder.
