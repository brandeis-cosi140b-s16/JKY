Hands down best tacos in town (maybe the entire USA). The ordering system is a little weird but I was here for the tacos.  The menu is small but everything on it is delicious.  Don't be afraid of the different meats.  They serve cesos (brains), lengua (tongue) and tripas  (tripe), and you should really try them.  The more common meats are great, but the other meats are typical street taco fillings. They are amazing!
