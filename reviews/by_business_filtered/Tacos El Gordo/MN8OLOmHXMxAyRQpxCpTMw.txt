I'm a huge fan of this place!!  One thing I really missed about LA is their tacos.  From guisados to the taco trucks, to the ones on the street with the ladies cooking on a cart...I miss all of it.  Tacos have been really hard to find in Vegas.  I am personally not a big fan of tex mex tacos...I want straight up street tacos with nothing but meat, cilantro and onions and the occasional sauce.

I've tried tacos at cardenas and I think they are decently good.  When I went to tacos el gordo on a Friday night, there was of course a line.  It moved fast though.  This place is unique in that they have several lines.  Lines depend on the meat you want on your tacos.  They have everything from lengua to tripe to asada to al pastor.  They didn't have carnitas though.  I lined up for their infamous spicy pork line.  When I went up to the guy, I asked for 2 spicy pork and one al pastor...he told me they were the same thing.  I thought that was weird because I thought they were different.  Anyhow, got 3 tacos and asked them for pineapples (complimentary) on the side.  

I went to another line to pay.  Finding seats can be hard on a busy night but people eat fast and you just have to keep an eye out.  I loved the tacos!!  More expensive than the dollar ones I used to get on the streets of LA but they were really tasty.  I loved the green sauce that it comes with as well.  The spicy pork is not spicy at all!  The look of it reminds of chinese roast pork because of its red exterior...but I didn't quite know how the mean taste like alone.  I just know that as a combination it was wonderful.  I can't wait to go back again!!

My friends also got the lengua and asada.  Honestly the asada was not that good.  It tasted like a hamburger to me...anyone else agree?  The lengua was really good though.  It was large chunks of tender and flavorful meat.  When I go back, I don't think I'll order anything but the al pastor though =).
