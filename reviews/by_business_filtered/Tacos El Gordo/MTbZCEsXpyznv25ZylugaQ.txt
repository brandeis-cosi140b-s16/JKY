I love that this place is so close to my house! and it's not as busy as the other ones so that's always a plus! the food is awesome, love their adobada! I haven't branched out and tried the other meats but maybe one day haha 

also it's a very clean looking facility. I've been the old location on the strip and that seemed so dirty. not this place! the employees are very quick to clean up after you get up from your table. 

this place is pretty awesome for when you wanna make a quick taco run!
