BEST tacos ever BYY FARRR. 

Adobada is BOMB. you have to get it. The staffs are all super friendly too. Don't judge the taco shop by its cover. Oh. also try Buches (pork stomach), cabesas (pork head meat), and Lenguas (beef tongue). I don't like the intestine one though...kinda gross....nor do i like the chorizo. Carne Asada's pretty good too :)
