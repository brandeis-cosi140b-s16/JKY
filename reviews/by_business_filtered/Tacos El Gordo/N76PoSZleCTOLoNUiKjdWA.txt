Came to this place out of curiosity to try it out. Was not expecting much other than some regular tacos like any other place. Walked in saw the kitchen setup was out in the open where you can see how your food is prepared and who prepares it, sort of like taquerias in the Mexican border towns. 
To order your food you've got to ask one of the taqueros what and how you want your food they make the fresh tortillas as you order. I gotta admit for two dollars I was expecting some bigger tacos but they did not disappoint. They stuff your tortilla as much as they can and you only need a couple of these to fill you up. I saw they had 10 dollar carne asada fries and wanted a try for 10 dollars i thought it was a lot but i gotta admit they are worth it, they are really generous and stuff that tray with as much meat and fries as they can. BEST CARNE ASADA FRIES I HAVE EVER HAD! 
For sure coming back to this place it does not compare to Tacos Mexico, or King Taco. This place is wayy better. Probably best taco place in VEGAS!! Highly recommend!
