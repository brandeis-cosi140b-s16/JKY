Authentic street style Mexican tacos in brick and mortar.  All the right fixin's, nothing fancy, and damn good! Be sure to get the roasted peppers and green onions-included in the price of the tacos. 

I love fusion food, exotic flavor combos, and fancy chefs, but nothing beats a simple and awesome street taco. 

The cashier was gracious and explained some unfamiliar items. Stations are broken down by meats, pay at the end. We ordered 8 tacos, different meats because I just couldn't decide. The fries are huge (we got a small) and that alone could have fed us.

Great food, great prices.
