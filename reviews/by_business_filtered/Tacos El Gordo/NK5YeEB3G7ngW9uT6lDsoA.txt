Based on proximity to my hotel and Yelp reviews, I decided to try this place. It looks a little sketchy, but I'm really glad I did... the food is amazing and fairly inexpensive. The nice outdoor seating area is a bonus. The tacos asada and adobada are delicious. I ordered one of each and then, immediately after finishing those, I went back for 2 more. It's not fancy, but it's great food.
