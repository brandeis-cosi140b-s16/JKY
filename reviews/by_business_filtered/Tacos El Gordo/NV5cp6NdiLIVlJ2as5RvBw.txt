This place ain't healthy eating, but the food is greasy-good.   I was suprised how much I liked the lengua (tongue) and the al pastor and adobada were both fantastic.  Good salsa, very fast service at the counter.  My kids and I were the only gringos in the place, which tells me the food is authentic.  I wish they'd open a location out in the northwest...
