After hearing about it from a friend and reading the reviews we decided to give it a shot and we were not disappointed! We tried the taco el pastor, carne asada taco, carne quesadilla, and the the carne fries (a lot I know) and it was all amazing. They top the carne with a generous amount of fresh guac that will blow your mind, and their fresh made corn tortillas are to die for. The pork is awesome, especially after watching it be cut right off the spit. We were a little confused on how to order and it was busy, but just ask anybody and they will be able to help you. The only thing I would have done differently is asked for some salsa on the side. Besides that we loved the food!
