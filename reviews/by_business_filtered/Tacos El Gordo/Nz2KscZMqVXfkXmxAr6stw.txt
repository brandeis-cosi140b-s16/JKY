My socal friends highly recommended this place so we decided to hit it up. There was about a 20 minute wait, but luckily for us, our friends had went ahead and ordered for us, so we skipped the line. 

Our group of 4 ordered 10 adobada tacos and one large adobada fries. The adobada isn't actually spicy so it was easy to devour the tacos. The fries have some green sauce drizzled all over it that my friend likes to call "crack" sauce since it is so addictive. 

This place is probably too far to walk from the middle of the strip, so I'd recommend taxiing here. It is well worth it!
