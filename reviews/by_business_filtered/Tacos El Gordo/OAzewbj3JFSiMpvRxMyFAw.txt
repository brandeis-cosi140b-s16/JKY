With all the good reviews, I had to give this one a try. Glad I did! All the other reviews were spot on. Only downgrade from 5 stars is due to the disposition of the cashier. She was not very nice and was not happy when I had to ask more than twice for some translation because my Spanglish needs some work. Other than that, a few pesky gnats found their way onto my tacos. Ordered 2 steak tacos and 2 spicy pork tacos and a diet coke.---$10.05. Not bad for Vegas.
