Oh em gee.  Beware!  $2 tacos will make you an addict!  

My ultimate favorite taco is the Tripa; extra crispy.  It's a crispy crunch when you take your first bite that ends in a nice melt in your mouth experience.  Super flavorful, tasty, and fulfilling.  It has that dense flavor that can only allow for a couple.

Mix the Tripa taco with a nice Al Pastor and Carne Asada and you're good to go.  All the tacos here pack some real flavor, and to me is considered the closest thing to really good Mexican food in all of Las Vegas. 

There is a good size indoor eating area, and a better sized outdoor eating area, and a big enough parking lot off the strip.  So it's actually easy to get up in this place and have some good ol' cheap but really awesome tacos!
