This place is straight fire. Everything about it was awesome. The tacos were a little pricey but that is expected when your getting something so savory. The ambience reminded me of south central LA, old school taqueria... I got adobo and carne asada. They also give you some roasted chiles that are awesome. I wish they would give u some chips but it's whatever's. Oh ya the salsa on the tacos is so bomb. Overall straight 5 stars, wish I could've gave it
