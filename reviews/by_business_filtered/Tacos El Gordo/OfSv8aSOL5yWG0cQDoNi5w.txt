Tacos el Gordo will never disappoint. Don't be surprised if there's a crowd, because this place has always and will always be bomb.com hahaha. Also don't worry if there's a crowd either because the guys behind the counter are SO FAST! The way they prepare your food is so amazingly quick! The flavors are also always so full, I never find myself having to add any extra sauces because it's that good! Love it. If you're by the area, come here for sure
