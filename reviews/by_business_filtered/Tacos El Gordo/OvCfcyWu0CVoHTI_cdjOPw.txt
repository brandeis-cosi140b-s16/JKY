Best tacos in town! I used to be a fan of Roberto's until I found this place. I've been numerous times and have always had a great experience. The adobada tacos are seasoned rotisserie pork they are my favorite. Try them "con todo" that means with everything. I usually eat 4-5 in a sitting. They are only $2.00 a piece, and well worth every cent. If you get the adobada fries only get a half order unless you want to share. You won't be disappointed!
