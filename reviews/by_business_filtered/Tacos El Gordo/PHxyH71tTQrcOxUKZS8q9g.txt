I went to vegas this past weekend for my birthday and my boyfriend wanted to visit a taco place he went to back in the day.  We told the cab driver where we wanted to go, he said, no you have to try here and thats how we found this place.  

The food here was so freaking good! I spent 3 days in California with my cousin and had mexican at places that I thought had the best food, but after going here, I was proven wrong. 

First of all we had no idea what we were doing or what anything was.  But i knew it was going to be awesome because of all the cops eating there.  I went up to a cop and asked him a few questions about what to order and what he recommended.  10 minutes later we walked out of there with a giant bag full of food.  

I wish i could give specifics on what we ordered, but honestly, I don't really remember.  We just took the cops recommendations and then when the guy behind the counter started asking us questions, I said " I have no idea, just make it like you would eat it."  

Everything was so delicious! It was the best Mexican food I ever had.  I strongly recommend getting the spicy pork.  It was delicious.  I wish we got everything with spicy pork.  This is a place I will definitely visit when i go to vegas next time, and I know I will be craving their food in the near future!
