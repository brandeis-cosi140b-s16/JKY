If I could give this place zero stars, I would. The ordering process is horrible. I waited in line for an hour to get our tacos, on a slower night! The meat tastes like charcoal. The place is filled with smoke because they have no ventilation system. The guacamole tasted like nothing! I love runny guacamole but this one had no salt, no flavor, it was bad. I wish there was a taqueria like the ones in Mexicali, where I'm from, which is what I was expecting. Don't believe the hype! This is not as good as the original.
