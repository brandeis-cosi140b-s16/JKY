Okay I've heard about this from so many people that I finally had to try it. Unfortunately the location on the strip is closed now but they have this location near downtown. Interesting way to order, just go down the line until you hit the register with a tray full of food. Seriously great tacos and I'll make sure to always make the drive or taxi for this meal when I'm in town!
