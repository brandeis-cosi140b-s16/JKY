It's a taco joint alright. At 230 am there was a line out the door. we tried the pastor and Diablo and they were great. I have heard about this place for a minute and can't believe I haven't been here sooner. great for any time of the day for a quick bite. if you are coming for service and plated food you will be disappointed.  but if you are coming for good mexican food and an experience you are at the right spot! highly recommended....
