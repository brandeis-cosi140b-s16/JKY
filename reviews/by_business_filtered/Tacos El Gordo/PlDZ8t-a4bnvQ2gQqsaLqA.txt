i don't know hooow this place got such high reviews... i think it's over hyped.

nevertheless, i wouldn't mind stopping by again when i'm staying at Wynn or Encore.  the tacos are SO much cheaper than what they got in the hotel!! totally worth the short walk from Encore lol

their salsa is fantastic! it makes chipotle's look like a joke.  don't underestimate it though, it's hella spicy! i'm from east coast so i was loving the authenticity of mexican food from southern west coast.  the steak taco is recommended-- i couldn't get myself to try those cow brains and w/e strangeness they were offering.. 

just a quick note about their quesadillas.. they're not your typical american quesadillas.. it looks something like between a sandwich and a salad.. bottomline--  it's really hard to eat! 

but yeah, i wouldn't go out of my way for this place even if you love nothing but tacos.
