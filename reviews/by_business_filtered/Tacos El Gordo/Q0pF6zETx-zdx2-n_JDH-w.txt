Give me the adobada tacos with everything on it. Please do not leave off the pineapple because that would be a crime. The other location has much more inside seating than this one, but the food is still just as good. One of my friends and I came straight after work and had to sit outside under the covered seating. It was 110 outside, but a couple of those tacos and a small order of carne asada fries to share makes anything bearable. Do not forget a cup of ice cold horchata to wash it all down. 

I would not normally lean towards Mexican food unless nudged in that direction by friends, but I am glad that I have some people who do enjoy this fare. Every once in a while, a trip to Tacos El Gordo does well for the soul. For some reason, I throw out most of my concerns with this establishment. What? You do not serve any veggies with your tacos? Okay, as long as you pile up that spit roasted meat, I will easily overlook it. What is that sauce you are dousing over my tacos? Whatever, it is just delicious, so keep it coming. By the time I am finished, I have ingested more than I normally would allow, I drank some of my calories and it is not getting me buzzed. Oh, how I have fallen. Yet it feels so good. Don't look at me!
