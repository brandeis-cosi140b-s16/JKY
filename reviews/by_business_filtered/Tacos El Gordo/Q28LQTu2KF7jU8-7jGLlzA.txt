I've been a huge fan of Tacos El Gordo...

When I heard they've moved from their old location, I was devastated!! Now that I'm here for the first time at their new location, here's a few things I've learned during my visit....

1) their crazy ordering line is still in place. Try opting to try some crazier stuff like their head, tongue or even tripe. There is absolutely no line for this window

2) grab a buddy. The more the merrier. Split up and grab a buddy for the carne asada line, their adobada line, and a SEAT!  They've increased their seating but people seem to be grabbing them fast so it's best if you have a body to secure one

3) don't be rude. Don't be that guy trying to cut in line. People will cuss you out. (I've seen it happen) lol

4) a lot more somewhat organized than the old location...in a weird way. I remember at the old location it was kind of a free for all and people were just yelling out orders but it seems a lot more tamed this time around...

New location, same taste!! Still delivering some of the best tacos I've eaten!! Never disappointed when I come! Just wish you guys were closer to the strip like before!
