This place is very good. But also very crowded especially late at night after the clubs start to clear. I ordered the adobada tacos which was their version of all pastor. It was very tasty and filled with meat. A pretty good deal for two bucks per taco. I didn't have a chance to try any of their other meats because of the way their lines are set up but I don't know if I need to get anything other than the adobada. Not the best tacos ever but they are very very good.
