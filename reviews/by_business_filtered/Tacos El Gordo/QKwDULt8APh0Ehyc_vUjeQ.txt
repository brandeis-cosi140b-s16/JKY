I was a little bit peeved to note that they don't offer chicken as a meat option. Apparently, that's not authentic. However, I must say that I was quite impressed with what I got.  I decided to get only carne asada (and I don't see why anyone else wouldnt). The tacos are fairly priced, considering that they don't skimp on meat and do include guacamole with each one at no additional cost. I'm a man with a moderately respectable appetite (king burger and fries at Fatburger) and I was satisfied with 3 tacos at lunch time. They didn't stuff me by any means but I was full enough and my wallet wasn't too light either. The combination of the cilantro, lime, onions and house salsa was enough to satisfy my craving for real mexican tacos. If all you care about is tacos, this is the place for you.
