I got 6 adobada tacos, and let me tell you they were some of the best tacos I've ever had, and I consider myself a taco expert. Fresh corn tortillas, pico, and the meat is cut right in front of you. The only down side is the wait is stupid long, I waited about 40 minutes, it also seemed like one of their kitchens were closed. Other than that these tacos are amazing at $2 a pop!
