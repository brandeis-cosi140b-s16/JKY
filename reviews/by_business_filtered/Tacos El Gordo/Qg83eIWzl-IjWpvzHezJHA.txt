In the shadow of Encore lies a taco place so magical that you will think it is a trap. The sign out front clearly advertises 2 dollar tacos.
2 dollar tacos? Yeah, right. You just walked through hotels where 10 square feet of tile work on the floor is worth more than your net worth and here you are, 2 minutes later, staring down a sign for 2 dollar tacos. There's no way these tacos can be good.

Yeah, they are awesome tacos.

The next time I go to Vegas, the plan will be - Stay at the Wynn, gamble at the Riviera, and get these tacos every time I walk in between the two places. The spicy pork taco meets expectations.
