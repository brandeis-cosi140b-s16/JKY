This place is weird....there are 4 lines for different meats. If you want a lengua taco wait in the lengua line...if you want Assad go wait in the Assad line. The men who prepare the food talk to you like you're special needs. They're so rude and they don't understand how confusing their entire set up is. It was so loud in there with one man butchering crane Assad that was full of fat...I couldn't hear the man asking me questions all the while he was behind the counter rolling his eyes at me. I understand people come in there drunk however all your patrons aren't drunk and I clearly wasn't. I wanted to throw the below average and expensive taco in his face. The place is cramped, dirty and the tacos are $2.00....in LA the most we pay for an incredible taco is $1.50.....I don't even pay that when I go to tacos Leo or chato. Some yelpers have nasty taste buds or something. Don't believe the hype for this place or earl of sandwich.....gross!!!!
