Still the most authentic Tj tacos you will find outside of Mexico. Prices are a bit high but worth it. We have healthy appetites and spend about $35 a trip here 

The negatives are that it is really hot in the restaurant, the lines are ridiculous and it's always over capacity with no seating.

All in all, always worth it.
