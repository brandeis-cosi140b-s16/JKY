So this place came highly recommend , it did not disappoint !  I haven't had a good taco like this since I was in tijuana.  Went with the Al pastor (pork) , they had a line split up for each type of meat (even though it seems like you could have ordered from any of the lines , but I rather give my order directly to the correct guy.   Meat was great , sauce was great.  Will def be coming back.
