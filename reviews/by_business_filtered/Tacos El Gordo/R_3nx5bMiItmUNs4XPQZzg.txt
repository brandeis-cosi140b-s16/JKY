This place was amazing! You know it's legit when it's packed all hours of the day and they are making the tortillas from scratch. Had the asada tacos which were really good. Love that they have guacamole included for no additional charge. But what really sold me was the asada fries. Such a good flavor with all the toppings. My new favorite Mexican place.
