Ok, I like Gordo, and even though I just recently found a new favorite rock throwing distance from here, my normal 5 star didn't get a drop to 4 due to this...

What did drop, was the cleanliness of the restaurant, when compared to their LV blvd location.  It wasn't bad, but it seems like they go the extra mile to tidy up at the spot I frequent often.

My lengua taco was not chopped up quite as much as it usually is at their other location.  I know, something very petty to complain about, but the taste also wasn't quite as fresh.  Or maybe it was just in my head..who knows.  Either way, I didn't feel the 5 star experience that I get at the strip loc.

Either way, these are still some excellent tacos, and at about $2 a pop, a good deal as well!
