There is no way that I am the first person to wonder just HOW many people have primarily experienced the magic of Tacos El Gordo buzzed or drunk. 

Open till 3a on the weekdays and 5a on the weekends, this is a go-to spot for folks with the late night munchies. The place's no-frills menu is the first thing through the door, with tacos being its shining star, offering choices including adobada, carne asada, cabeza for two bucks a pop. There are other items like quesadillas, mulas, and carne asada fries, but you can't go wrong with tacos. 

Ordering can be a little tough if it's been a few years since you last sang "La Camisa Negra" by Juanes in high school, but the language barrier is minimal. There are several service stations and you can see them slapping on the ingredients in front of your very eyes so you know the STUFF BE FRESH. 

"Me encantan!"
