Came here on a Saturday night and it was packed to the brim.  Chose to stand in the Adobada line since it was the shortest and seemed to be moving the fastest.  Would have preferred to try the Asada but wasn't worth the wait.  After about 15-20 minutes of waiting in a line in a hot and crowded room, we get to the front and I ask the guy what else I can get in the line and he said he would recommend the beef shoulder.  We ended up getting 4 Adobada tacos and 4 beef shoulder tacos.  I was extremely skeptical because I just didn't think it was worth the wait and being from LA, I've had what I considered great tacos before.  Well, this place topped them all by a large margin.  I would recommend both tacos that we got.  The beef shoulder was slow cooked and cut fresh, and the Adobada was cooking on the vertical spit.  The Adobada was perfectly cooked with a smoky flavor that I don't think is reproducible.  The beef shoulder was slow cooked and tender and would take too much time to do.  There is a wait but it is well worth it.  This place is the blueprint for how a taco joint should be run.  Quality food, preparation, and selection.  Effing amazing!
