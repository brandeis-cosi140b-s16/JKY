Hands Down the Best Tacos in Vegas!
Perhaps even the best tacos in the west. There are other locations, like the one in San Diego, but there is something special about this place. The taste is very authentic, from the hand made tortillas, to the meat, to the fresh salsa and guacamole. If you love going to Tijuana for tacos, but hate the crossing the border for two hours plus... then this is the place to go. Just like TJ, but no need to wait to come back. 

Only issue is the line / crowd control... there are two lines, one for asada, one for everything else... and the line for asada is usually about 20 - 30 minute wait to order, while the other is very small usually under 10 minutes... but you don't know about the two lines until you've waited in them for a while. But there is a PRO TIP here... offer the guy in the alpastor line a nice 3 dollar tip and ask him to order a few asada tacos for you... works every time ! (Of course this only works in spanish... but it works).

besides the huge lines, this place is the best... even after waiting 20 minutes... I still give it five stars, cause there is nothing like it... best place to eat in Vegas : )
