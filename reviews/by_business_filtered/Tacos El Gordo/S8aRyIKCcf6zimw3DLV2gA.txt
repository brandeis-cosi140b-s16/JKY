I love the food here, I was in town for new years and ate here on 3 separate occasions. I'm a fan of the original one in Tijuana so I was thrilled to see that Vegas had one also, and they did not disappoint the food was exactly as I remembered it. I gave them four stars only because of the extensive wait times which may have been because of the holiday but that clearly didn't stop me from going back multiple times over 3 days.
