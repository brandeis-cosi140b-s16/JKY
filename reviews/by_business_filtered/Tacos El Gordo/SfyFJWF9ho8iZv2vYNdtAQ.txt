Pure delicious awesomeness. Where else can you get cow tongue, brain, and head tacos? Don't worry, they also have excellent (normal) beef and pork options. Very nice people too. When I was told that they don't have tamales, a sweet employee even gave me one of hers that she brings in for her fellow coworkers. Skip the overpriced casino eateries and grab a couple of tacos for just $2 each (and you might even get a free tamale).
