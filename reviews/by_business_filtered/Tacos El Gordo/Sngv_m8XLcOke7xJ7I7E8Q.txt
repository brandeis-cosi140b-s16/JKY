I have been meaning to go to Tacos El Gordo for quite some time now. I have seen in other reviews that the lines are long, but worth the wait.
I went on a Tuesday at 2:00PM for lunch.
I walked in and there was only 2 other people in front of us in line.... Yay!
I got the adobada tacos and asada tacos with everything.
They were really good!!! The adobada were my favorite!!!
I will definitely be back.!!!
