ALWAYS A MUST FOR EVERY VISIT TO SIN CITY.  I cant leave without having these baja tacos.  The Al Pastor BEST EVER! With the spcial guacamole sauce.  The. you have the mulitas Aaaaamazing! You have to try one of each to see which you love the most!  Whichever you select YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED.  On the downside the prices are a bit hi for tacos But they are so good it wont even matter!
