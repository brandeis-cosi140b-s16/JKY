I still remember seeing this place when it first opened and witnessing how its evolved into this taco juggernaut. The space got bigger, they added outdoor seats, and now the crowd is out of control.  Midday Saturday I waited 15 minutes for food. Can't imagine what its like peak times.  Same recos - spicy pork is solid, almost like chinese bbq pork. Lengua is good too. Spicy pork fries are $10 and massive enough will feed an army of children (or hungry men,  whomever you have). Even the half size lengua fries are massive, but the pork is better,  unfortunately only comes in large.
