I hope they make a chain in every single city in the states. That's all

We went here for lunch on a Sunday before driving home. It was packed and was confusing at first how to order. There are different lines for different meats you want, so make sure to look at the lines and plan accordingly. It really helps if you have a friend with you to have the friend wait in another line. After you get amazing tacos with variety of meat, you go to the counter to pay.

I highly recommend Adobada, Carne Asada, and Chorizo. They are amazing tacos for very cheap that every taco-lovers should try
