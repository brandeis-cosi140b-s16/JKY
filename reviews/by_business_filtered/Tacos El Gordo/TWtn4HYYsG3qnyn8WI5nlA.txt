Bottom line - the tacos are awesome. Those that are giving this place a bad review are hating on the furniture (it's a hole-in-wall where you pay $2/taco - what do you expect??) and it not being authentic (we were the only white peeps in here so...). We had both the spicy pulled pork and the carne asada. A few pointers:
- There are a few different lines for a few different things - don't be afraid to ask someone who works there. 
- Lunch/brunch time on Sat or Sun is suicide...come either late night or on an off-meal time. 

I wish this place was near my house.
