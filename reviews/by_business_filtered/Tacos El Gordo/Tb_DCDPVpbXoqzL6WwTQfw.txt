I can see why this place is so popular. The price for the quality of food is unbeatable around the strip. We went here during dinner time and the line was out of the door, but luckily the servers worked REALLY fast. There were different lines for different orders, so I suggest figuring out which line you are standing in before blindly standing behind someone. Overall the food was good, but I wished they had some grilled onions to enrich the flavor.
