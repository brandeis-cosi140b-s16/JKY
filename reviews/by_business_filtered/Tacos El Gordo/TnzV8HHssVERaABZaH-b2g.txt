Looking for some great tacos in Vegas? Check this place out. I ordered the carne asada tacos and shared carne asada fries with friends. Because they use real charcoal grills to cook the meat, the tacos had great flavor. Smoky essence and refreshing from the cilantro, onion, salsa garnish. The carne asada fries were good and similar favors like the tacos, but instead of the garnish mentioned, it's topped with cheese. Can't go wrong, but I recommend sharing the fries. They had other tacos such as lengua, pastor, and cabeza, which I'll try next time. Ample parking outside, and we came on a Thursday night and no waiting in line.
