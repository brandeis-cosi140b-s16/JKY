My first stop once I get my car rental is Taco El Gordo. Win or loose in Vegas this place gets a minimum of 3 visits during a 5 day trip. The pork tacos are out of this world. I feel like I am in Mexico from the first to last bite. I would give this 10 stars if I could. Thanks for making this a must whenever I go to Vegas!
