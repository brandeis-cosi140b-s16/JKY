This place has been set up for organized chaos. There were 3 lines. Each one was for a specific type of meat. The line for the al pastor was the longest of the three.  The man was amazingly quick.  Made the tortillas warm, carved off some meat, scooped some onions, salsa and a guacamole crema. My sister was in line for the lengua. This server was just as quick and efficient. After getting our tacos, paid and got seated at one of the few empty seats. Started with the lengua. The lengua was not tough at all. Melt in your mouth amazing. The tortillas were full of flavor and the salsa was a perfect match.  Then went on to the al pastor. The flavor of the meat was great. The meat was tender and the sauces made it even better. The tortillas was dunked in the juices from the al pastor. Had this meal at 12:30am and I was already full but it was so worth it. I heard that the one near the Wynn always had a line for the lengua and the shorter lines were for the other meats. The location is a bit far off since it is in downtown but it is worth the drive. Definitely going to try to come back. Puts LA taco trucks to shame.
