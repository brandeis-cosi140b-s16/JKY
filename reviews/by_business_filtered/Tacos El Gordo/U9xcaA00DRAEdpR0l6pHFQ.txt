I had the pleasure of eating dinner at gordos tacos...it was really busy...it smelled so good when I walked it.  I saw the pastor being freshly cut off... And the tortillas were all being hand made and thrown right on the grill and then immediately filled with the fresh meats...I tried them ALL...pastor, chorizo, chicken, carne asada, it was all delicious...I didn't understand why the fry plate was but later when I saw people eating it I wanted to try that too!  I will get that next time!
