At $2 per taco, or something like that, I took down over $20 in food.  Yes it is that good!  I kept going back for more.  I love that Spanish is the official language of choice in this place.  I loved that they cut the meat right in front of you and as you order you aren't sure if you are ordering something weird like tongue or liver or brain.  Who knows, but really who cares.
