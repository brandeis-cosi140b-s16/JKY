I live in Los Angeles so there is an abundance of restaurants to get tacos so I have pretty high expectations.  I went to Tacos El Gordo as a spontaneous trip and it happened to be on a Saturday night.  It was very busy and the lines were long.  The wait wasn't too bad but there were 3 separate lines (different meat in each line) which isn't clear at all until the cooks yell it out.  So you could be in the front of the line and find out at the last minute that you are in the wrong line.  I had to constantly deal with other customers pushing through the lines to get to the soda machines.  Other than those things, the food was good but definitely try different meats.  I have gone twice and once I made the mistake of ordering 3 different items but with the same meat so everything tasted the same.  The menu isn't big but items are made to order and the tortillas are homemade.  All employees were working hard and I didn't notice any with attitudes.
