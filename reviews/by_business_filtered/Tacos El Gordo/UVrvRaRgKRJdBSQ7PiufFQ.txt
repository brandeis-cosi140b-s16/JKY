1.  Thank you Yelpers for the recommendation.

2.  Get off the strip and come try these tacos.  They are one of a kind and well worth the effort of finding a way to get here.  Words cannot describe how good these things are!   Other pros -- the tacos are super cheap - dirt cheap - compared to anything on or near the strip.  They also take credit cards!

3.  Adobada.

4.   Learn to say Adobada -- that's what you're going to want to order!

I tried a variety of tacos.  All were great, but my favorite was the Adobada.  The line for those specific tacos is longer than the rest.  Anytime I'm in LAs Vegas, I will definitely make a trip to grab a few tacos.

I'm telling you -- go now!
