Best tacos in the USA. Ordering can be a little intimidating but you'll figure it out. This is a very authentic and traditional taco shop so don't expect burritos here. They do however have carne aside fries that can be ordered with al pastor pork as well. The high light of this awesome place is the al pastor (marinaded pork roasted on a vertical spit) and the fact that the carne aside is cooked over wood fire. I've lived in California and Las Vegas my whole life and I can honestly say these are the best tacos. Nothing really comes close to Tijuana tacos like this place.
