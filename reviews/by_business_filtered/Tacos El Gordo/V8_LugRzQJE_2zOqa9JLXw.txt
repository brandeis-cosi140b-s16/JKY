This place is delicious!! If you live anywhere near Las Vegas and you haven't tried them you need to add it to your to do list. Their tacos are amazing and waiting in the 5-10 minute lines is never a problem. Ive been here dozens of times and you should too!

P.S: If you're ordering tacos, I suggest you try them on flour tortillas, they're really good!
