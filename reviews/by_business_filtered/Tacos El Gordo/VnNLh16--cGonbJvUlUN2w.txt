OMG.. I've been thinking about this place since we left Vegas! We went in one night for a couple of tacos.. I wanted a Carne asada taco and quesdilla.. Well there was somewhat of a language barrier that actually worked to my advantage. What I ended up with was a quesadilla on a flour tortilla what was open faced with tons of tasty carne asada on top. It was so flavorful and filling. We ended up going back there the following night for dinner.
