If I knew I had one day left to live in Las Vegas, I would do a lots of things.  One of these things would be to walk up to the carnitas that's slowly cooking at Tacos El Gordo and take a big bite out of it.  I imagine the workers would tried to restrain me, and as this is happening, I would attempt a second bite out of the pineapple on top.  

This is a hidden gem on the strip (maybe not so hidden since there are so many reviews??)  I came here in the middle of the day on Wednesday and had 5 tacos.  2 Carnitas (of course), 2 Carne asada, and a chorizo (this is great, I feel like it goes unnoticed amongst other things).  I also ordered the nopales (cactus).  I think vegetarians would really appreciate this dish.  They serve the tacos with grilled green onions.  Parking was easy but it was a random hour.  I can't imagine what happens to this place on a weekend night.

Good job Tacos El Gordo.  You have a funny name (translates to Tacos The Fat).  But I will return regardless of your silly name.  Adios muchachos!!!
