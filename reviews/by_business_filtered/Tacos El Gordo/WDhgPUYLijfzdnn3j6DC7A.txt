So you've made it rain at the Wynn and/or Encore, and now you're starvin' like Marvin (who is this guy, anyway?). Now what? Well, you have the choice of 1) spending more money on food at the restaurants inside either hotel or 2) head a little further down The Strip and get your taco on here. I'm sure the latter is a much better choice. My friends never tuned me on to this until now (thanks a lot, guys! *sarcasm*). Made sure I made the most out of my first visit and got 3 tacos: lengua, asada, and adobada. All of them paired up with a large Horchata made it the best late night grub I've had in Vegas. Ever. It's probably saying a mouthful (and no, I kept classy and had those tacos one at a time), but it's true.
