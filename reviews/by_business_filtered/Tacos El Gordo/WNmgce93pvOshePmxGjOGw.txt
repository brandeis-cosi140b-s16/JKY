This place gets packed! Try to either get here real early or really late to avoid the crowds and long lines. You'll find an array of meats and condiments to choose from all within a peasants budget! I highly recommend the adobada on anything! The refillable Aguas Frescas is a plus! Most taco shops I go to normally charge an arm and a leg for additional refills haha. Give this place a try for sure if you're in the area.
