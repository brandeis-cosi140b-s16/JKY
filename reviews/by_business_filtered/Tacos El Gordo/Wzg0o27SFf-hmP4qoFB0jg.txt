This place by far has the best tasting carne asada. The actual meat better than Pepe's, my mistress and Roberto's my love. 

That said, it's a little pricey (minus one star). $2.00 for a taco? Not too bad. $4.00 for a taco sized quesadilla with only one tortilla??? Ouch! It's good food though, minus the guacamole. It's disgusting and I am a guacamole lover. Try it on the side?

They do have a variety of different meats. I've tried the spicy pork, which I think they are famous for, and the carne asada but they have a bunch of other stuff. The spicy pork is SPICY, but different in a good way? I'd try it once, and go from there.

I like the vibe of the place and it feels super authentic. Definitely try it!
