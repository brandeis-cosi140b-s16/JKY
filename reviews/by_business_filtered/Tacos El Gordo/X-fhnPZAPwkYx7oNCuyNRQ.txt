We were walking up the strip and came upon this taco place that has been raved about on Yelp and by some friends we know. Naturally, we had to eat there given the circumstances: tipsy, tired, and the great reviews.

We ordered two tacos and a mulita each, plus a coke. Of course it's Vegas, so the tacos were way higher priced than your normal King Taco. That's something I don't care about if the food is delicious. Unfortunately, the meat was so bland! The only thing we tasted were the onions and cilantro. That's it!

I'm not so sure they season their meat, but we were very disappointed!
