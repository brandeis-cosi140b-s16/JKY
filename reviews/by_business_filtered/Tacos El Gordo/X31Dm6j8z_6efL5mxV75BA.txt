Tacos were fantastic and at $2 a pop too. I had the spicy pork, which weren't too spicy. I had the regular pork and didn't really taste much of a difference between the two. The one drawback is if you want different types of tacos, such as the pork and the spicy pork, you have to get on different lines. My friend got the half order of carne fries. They were huge, it was full styrafoam container of fries, cheese, pork, guac and sauce. We couldn't finish them. The lines move pretty fast, but it is a hassle to wait on more than one line. Then you still have to wait on another line to pay. They had a tent for extra seating, which was heated. We arrived near closing and this place was packed and more people were coming in. I guess it was the place to grab some grub after a night of clubbing.
