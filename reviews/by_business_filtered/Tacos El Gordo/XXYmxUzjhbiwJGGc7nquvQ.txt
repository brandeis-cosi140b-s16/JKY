BEST tacos ever!!  Literally!  Every time I make a trip out to Las Vegas, I have to stop by this taco joint!  By far the best tacos everrrrr!!  There are usually a line out to the door, but that's a given since its simply the best!  There is also a taco salsa which is great! The workers are always so nice, but very pushy, only because everyone is ready to chow down on their tacos!
