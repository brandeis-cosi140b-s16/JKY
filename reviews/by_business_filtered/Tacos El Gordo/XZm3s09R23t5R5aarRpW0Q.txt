Hands down, the best tacos around! This location has expanded recently. They took over the suite to the right side of them so it made my last experience less hectic with faster order lines and more seating. The outside patio has double in size also. 

Onto the food. Ooh...Mee...Gee! The adobada (spicy pork) is to die for, carved off a huge slab of flavored pork rotating inside of a flame roasting cooker. Every bite was bursting with flavor and the green guacamole cilantro sauce on top just made it that much better.  

If you rather op for something other than tacos then no need to worry. They offer other items on the menu like tostadas or quesadillas. I also love the nacho fries with either adobada or carne asada meat. For those of you that can't decide between the 2 then make it a half and half. Mmmm....I could just smell the food now. DROOL!
