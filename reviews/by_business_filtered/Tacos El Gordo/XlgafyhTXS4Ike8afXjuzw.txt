Tacos are good!  I feel like I'm back in So cal at a taco truck.  Except this isn't quite as cheap.

Long lines, but they move quickly.  Prices are decent... $2 each, but the fries are a little high.  They add a lot of meat, but I would just get a half order instead of paying $10 for fries. 

Hours are great.. They're open super late and they have plenty of seating.  Parking can be a little tough but its not bad.

If I am in the mood to wait, I will be back.
