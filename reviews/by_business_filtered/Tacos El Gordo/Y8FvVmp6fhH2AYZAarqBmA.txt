Tacos were awesome! I came in during the week and it was so empty. I had my doubts at first. The adobadas tacos are definitely the way to go! asada and chorizo were just meh in my opinion. The asada I had was flavorless and burnt and the chorizo just lacked in flavor. But the adobadas... delicious, moist and bursting with flavor. We stopped by once more on a Sunday, before we left Vegas to load on up tacos for the road trip back home. Sunday was packed wall to wall with people. We split up so we can each wait in a line for tacos... there are 3 separate lines you fall in depending on what kind of meat you'd like in your taco. Managed to get in and out in about 20 minutes. Gordo tacos for the drive home was an awesome idea!
