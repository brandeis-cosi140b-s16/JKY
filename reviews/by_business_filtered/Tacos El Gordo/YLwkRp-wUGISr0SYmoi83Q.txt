Not as good as the Tacos el gordo in San Diego but still very good!  

Adobada Tacos are all you need here.  The perfect mixture of salsa, guac sauce, fresh tortillas, and of course, the spicy pork... delicious!  

I just remember the tacos being bigger and tasting a little better in san diego.

This was probably my favorite meal this past weekend in vegas.
