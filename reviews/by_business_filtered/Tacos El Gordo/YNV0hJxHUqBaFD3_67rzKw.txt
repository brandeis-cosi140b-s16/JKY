The tacos here are great!  It's the best taco I've ever had. The tortillas are homemade.  They are soft, tender and just fabulous!!  I like the lengua(beef tongue).  It's juicy, tender and flavorful.   The meat are chopped into tiny cubes, The taco comes with a generous portion of meat and tops with a heaping tablespoon of sauce, onion and cilantro.  You got to make a stop here if you're in Vegas!!  Their coconut popsicle is good toooooooo!
