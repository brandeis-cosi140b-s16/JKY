The asada taco is very good, but adobada taco is an eye-opening flavor explosion.  We went for a two-taco snack, finished, and got back in line for more.  Every order is freshly made, including the tortilla for the asada tacos.  The whole operation is very efficient, but the wait is still somewhat long due to sheer volume.  Worth it.  So worth it.
