Oh my Yum! It's like organized chaos when you get in to order, you place yourself in either the pork, beef or "other" line (can't think of the name) and you tell the staff behind the counter your order. They prepare the food in front of you, then you pay. Make sure you have others save you a booth. It was packed both times I've been to the restaurant. First was during a late dinner hour, the 2nd was around 5:30. You won't be disappointed.
