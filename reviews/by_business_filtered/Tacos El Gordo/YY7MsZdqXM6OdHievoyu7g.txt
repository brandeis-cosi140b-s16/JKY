In Vegas, you won't know tacos until you come to Tacos El Gordo.

Well, what about it makes it so amazing? Everything. This is not a typical taco stand or a Roberto's that around your corner, this is amazingness in a taco. You start off going up to a different portion of the counter and ordering something that is specific for that portion of the counter. I have tried a lot of different kinds of tacos, but the most appealing taco for me is the adobada taco. The meat is cut off a rotating roaster kind of thing and if you are lucky enough to get it off of it, the tacos are even more amazing. Those are personally my favorite, and I'm sure it is popular amongst other customers as well. They also have an adobada version of these in fries, you know, like carne asada fries, but with adobada, and I perosnally think it is way more delicious, and so if you like carne asada fries, I recommend trying the adobada fries.

Sometimes it can get a little hectic ordering from the counter and it might be a little complicated if you can't speak Spanish, but you should still be able to get away with ordering still. The dining area isn't too bad at all and once you take a bite of the food, you'll be enjoying yourself. Tacos can run about $2 each, which may be on the pricier side, but still delicious nonetheless.
