awesome! Tijuana style tacos in Vegas, I thought I was dreaming when I saw the sign. So refreshing after days of expensive mediocre food and buffets with taco-bell style Mexican food (WTF???)

fresh made corn tortillas....grilled onions and peppers...amazing grilled meats and salsas. That's all you need.
