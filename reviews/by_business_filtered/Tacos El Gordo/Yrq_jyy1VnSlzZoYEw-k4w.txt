This place is amazing!! They don't really have this on the menu but you can ask for 1/2 lengua and 1/2 adobada fries!! It's soooo good! The meat is well seasoned and the fries are perfectly cooked. This is a must whenever we go to vegas because it is the perfect junk/latenight food. They did move off the strip so you do have to drive further to get here, but this means more parking and shorter lines so I can't complain. You have to try this place!
