I am so sad I could not give them five stars. The best authentic Mexican food this aide of the border.  Flavors burst into your taste buds as you try to remember what tacos you ever tasted better then these. NEVER. EVER. Teajuana bases flavor.  El Gordo has the cooking down to a fine science.  Like most Mexican restaurants they need a gringo to fix the traffic jam of customers trying to spend their money.  Walking into this Maze of people you think of a Chinese fire drill. Walk in four feet and it looks like the 405 and the 710 freeway meet.with a little more planning this place could triple their income. Poor design.  Not customer friendly.  Each item, different line. Booooo!  I would love to complain to someone that would make a difference. Make the right move for your Mexican audience.  They will come.
