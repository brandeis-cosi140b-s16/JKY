Finally made it over here for lunch after several recommendations from friends.  The place was hopping!  Fortunately I had read some reviews and was able to navigate the line system, but I can see it being confusing for the uninitiated.
Ordered a mix of carne adovada, carne asada & suadero tacos.  Adovada was by far the most enjoyable.  Suadero was tender and smoky.  Carne asada was passable, but not my favorite in town.  The corn tortillas were pulled fresh off the grill, and the various sauces that accompanied the tacos were flavorful.  Everything here was good, but outside of the carne adovada I wouldn't classify anything as great.  Maybe my expectations were too high, as the tacos had been described as a "life-changing experience." Who knows...
Service was definitely friendly and the lines move relatively quickly.  Bottomless horchata is a plus.  All-in-all, a pleasant experience.
