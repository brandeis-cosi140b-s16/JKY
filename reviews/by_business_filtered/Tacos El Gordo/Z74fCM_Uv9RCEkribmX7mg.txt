Absolutely killer flavors. Very impressed with this place. The taco selection is magnificent and the prices are affordable, and it's open late! If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.
The only reason I'm giving Tacos El Gordo four stars is because the line system can get pretty messy. It's not a big deal, just ask a worker or someone around you if you're confused about which line to wait in. All I'm saying is that a couple small signs above the ordering counters would make the line setup a whole lot better, and would earn this place a solid five stars.
