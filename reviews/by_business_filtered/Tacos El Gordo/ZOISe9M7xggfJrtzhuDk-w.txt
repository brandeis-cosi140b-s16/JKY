My coworker recommended this spot to me.  On a friday night it is busy but man this spot is LEGIT.  Order the lengua, carne asada, and adobada tacos.  I can live here as they also offer carne asada fries.  It is a huge box, and man it can feed an army of 4 starving Californians.  I would come here again and again.  Super fast, good, authentic, and FUN. Drink when in Vegas but don't drive.
