Thanks to my fellow tellers and my love for tacos, I had to come here! I came during the luck hour so it wasn't so busy. However I still became a little confused about te ordering window for what meat you want. I was going by the menu and not by the tiny little clear sign under the menu that reads what kind of meat that person is making. I love how they had two sides to place making it easier and faster to order.

I got the carne asada tacos with everything. I loves them. Reminded me of the tacos I use to eat in TJ. My bf on the other hand didn't care for them. He felt they were bland. I will agree that the meat was bland but who needs seasoning when you have salsa?!

I wish they had more locations so I wouldn't have to travel to the strip just for some great tacos. I will be coming back for more!
