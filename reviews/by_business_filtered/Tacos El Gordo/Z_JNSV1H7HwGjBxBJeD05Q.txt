Tasty food made fairly authentically.  The cut the meet in front of you, make the tortillas from scratch and offer you a friendly smile as they serve you.  The food is really good...not the best mexican I ever had, but certainly a dependable option if you want to get away from the mainstream vegas joints off the strip.
