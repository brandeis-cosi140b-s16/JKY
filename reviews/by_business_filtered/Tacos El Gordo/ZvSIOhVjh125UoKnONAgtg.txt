Best tacos ever!! I got the carne asada tacos and it was so good I wanted more, but I also got carne asada fries so I had way too much food. The carne asada fries were good but I've definitely had better. It was missing pico!! If it had it on there, I think it would have been a lot better. The tacos were SUPER good. I wish I got more and these tacos are only $2 each! (and it comes with guac!). 

It's kinda at the edge of the strip right after Encore, but don't worry because there are tons of people still walking around at 2 or 3 am! (:
