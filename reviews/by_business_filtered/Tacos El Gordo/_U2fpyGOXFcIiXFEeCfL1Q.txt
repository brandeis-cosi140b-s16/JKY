Great authentic local Mexican place off the beaten path..... known for their tacos - had the carne asada and spicy pork ones - very flavorful and the corn tortillas are nice and fresh.  Had 3 and could have had at least one more!  

Conveniently located in a large plaza with plenty of parking - about 10-15 minutes driving distance off the Strip.
