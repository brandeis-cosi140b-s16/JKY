These will be one of the best tacos you will have IMO.  We had these in TJ, and they taste pretty much the same, so authentic!  In TJ, they make their horchata from scratch though...not here :(

Anyways, if you have never been, one word : ADOBADA.  Adobada is a marinated pork awesomeness that is fire grilled on a rotisserie like setup.  This is why this place is awesome, so if you come here, you owe it to yourself to try it.  Try it MULAS style, which is essentially a taco, but with another tortilla on top with cheese in the middle...quesadilla style.  Try it on the fries...can't go wrong....it is awesome.

Besides that, I have tried some of the others...the beef head and regular asada is great, but it doesn't shine a light to the adobada imo.

Besides the flavor, you can't beat the price.  Tacos start at $2, and although you will need a few to fill you up, I find it difficult to believe you will find anything this good to eat 24-7 especially on the strip.

They just expanded, so it is much easier to find a seat and the lines are shorter...but still be prepared to wait a bit to order.

Go see for yourself!
