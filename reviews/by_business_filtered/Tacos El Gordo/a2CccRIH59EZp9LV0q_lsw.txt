We had a lot of tacos, half lengua fries, and horchata.

Fries: good, but lots of sauce and sour cream on top. The meat was good, but towards the end, the softness/fluffiness started to bother me. Would skip next time and get another taco, since we were stuffed as well.

Tacos:
1. Adobada x2: delicious
2. Suadero: great
3. Buche x2: chewy, good
4. Al pastor: good

Horchata: not as cinamon-y as I like, but good.

Price: $21 for 2 people

Verdict: We tried lots of different things, so that was fun. The different lines are annoying. The food was greasy, but you already expect it. I'll stick with Taco y Taco since that's closer (and because I think I prefer it).
