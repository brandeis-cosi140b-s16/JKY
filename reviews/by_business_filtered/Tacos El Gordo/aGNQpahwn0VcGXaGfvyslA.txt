I was on a business trip in Vegas when I discovered Tacos El Gordo - it was definitely the BEST hidden gem on the strip! 

Like any other review, this place has good, affordable tacos! I ordered 4 of the adobada (spicy pork) tacos, and i definitely could have more! Each taco is served in a mini corn tortilla. At $2 each, you can't go wrong!!! I am sad that I didn't get to try the carne asada fries, so that's a must for my next visit to sin city. 

This location is about a 10 minute walk from The Wynn, so it is definitely very convenient for those staying there.

I highly recommend this place if you're looking for good, affordable food on the strip!!
