Best tacos ever! I am Mexican and from LA so I KNOW my tacos. Not even LA has better tacos. Their style is what I am used to eating while visiting family in TJ and Ensenada. The first time I tried these was while I was in San Diego and I have fallen in love with them ever since. The location here is a MUST GO anytime that I am in Vegas. They're a little pricey but let me tell you that they are worth every penny. My usual order consists of 3 Al Pastor tacos with everything, 2 tripa tacos extra crispy and some cebollas and chile. This location is one of the best since I have been to all of theirs. The location in Temecula, CA is the worse! Re-cap. You cannot get better al pastor tacos anywhere especially in LV. YOU MUST GO HERE!!!!
