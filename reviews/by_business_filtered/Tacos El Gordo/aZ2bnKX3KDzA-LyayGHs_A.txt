Just like it's a good sign when you go into a Japanese restaurant and all of the workers are Japanese... you know you're going to get some good Mexican food when you walk into a Mexican place and all of the workers (and most customers) are Mexican!  And this place rocked!  The menu is simple - think the taco version of In and Out Burger menu.  Just tacos, fries, and that's pretty much it.   The adobado tacos, $2 each, amazing!  Pork marinated in a red chili sauce with vinegar and oregano.  There is one line for all things abodabo, so make sure you're in the right line.  We also got the abodabo fries - the same pork over fries with a bunch of yummy sauce all over it!  And the half order is HUGE!  The other line is for all other tacos - we also got carne asada tacos.  Those were good too but I'm an abodabo fan!  You can also get a side of grilled veggies.  And then there's a jalape√±o, lime, and radish bar... to garnish your tacos.  Salsa is behind the counter where you pay so you have to ask for it.   Definitely a must do when in Las Vegas! The only other place you can experience Tacos El Gordo is in Tijuana.
