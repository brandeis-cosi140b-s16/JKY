i am a 23 latino man who has had tacos all his life. i can honestly say that these tacos are on of my top three all time best. there is always a giant line for a reason. you can see a sence of pride in the food these guys make. i dont like the fact that there is never any seats and that the lines are way too long but the tacos are so great that i must give this play a perfect rating.
