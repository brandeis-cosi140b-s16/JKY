Five stars because this place never disappoints and everything on the menu is delicious! It's as close to authentic Mexican tacos as any place around here could be.

Tacos El Gordo is my fave taco spot in San Diego, so imagine my delight when I found out they came to Vegas! Most menu items are on the same level as the original spot, so big kudos there!

Asada, Al Pastor, Adobada, Cabeza, Lengua never fails. Tacos, Fries, Mulas, Vampiros are all delicious!! Don't forget your grilled veggies, salsas, and tasty beverages!

This spot is significantly less crowded and better maintained than the Charleston location. I think varying customer service, long lines, and difficult parking situations during peak hours are normal for a humble yet busy taco shop, and this place is no different from the rest in that sense.. but I find they are polite and accommodating more often than not. If you come with the right expectations, you should leave with all that matters, a very happy tummy!!
