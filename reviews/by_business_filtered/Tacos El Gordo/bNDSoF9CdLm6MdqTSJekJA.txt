I couldn't tell if I was still drunk or hungover. Either which, my diminished blood sugar filled rage went ahead and decided to order everything I possibly could.

The neat thing about this place is that they separate the lines into three, so different stations serve different items. I didn't dare venture into the soup looking thing, so I stuck to the tacos and loaded french fries.

For the price, venue, and how drunk I was this place was freaking awesome.
