Best tacos on the Las Vegas Strip. Tacos El Gordo is like a pyramid scheme. My friend took me here once, I got addicted to it then I started to bring my friends. After my friends tried it, they bring their own friends to try it. The foods are good and they open late. If you have a mid-night hunger, picks Tacos El Gordo over Taco Bell!!
