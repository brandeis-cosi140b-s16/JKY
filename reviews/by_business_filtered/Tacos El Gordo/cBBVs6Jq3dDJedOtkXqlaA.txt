I probably have zipped by this place dozens of times and didn't realize what I've been missing. The adobada is the best I have ever had. Hands down the best authentic street taco joint!! The adobada had such deep layers of flavor and melts in your mouth. We had ordered a variety of tacos to see which will be our go to when we return. The carne Asada had a great smoked flavor while very tender like the adobada. I also tried the chorizo and once again I savored ever bite to fully enjoy all of the spice and complimenting flavors. But it was the adobada that was the winner. I would have loved to buy a container of that meat. Open till 5 am this place will be my new late night grub stop.
