This was our first stop after reaching Vegas. Lucky for us, the wait was not long or crazy (what this location is known for).The line to order may be different depending on what you want. We tried the Adobada tacos (spicy pork) & asada. The Adobada tacos are sooooo good!Ask for pineapple strips (which add a nice sweetness). There is a drink fountain with flavors like Tamarind. The condiment bar was super clean with limes and radishes. Well maintained!
