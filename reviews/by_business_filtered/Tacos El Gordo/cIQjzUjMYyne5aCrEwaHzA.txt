I have yet to see a taco joint where they serve excellent tacos AND fries. Here, you are delighted to tacos of all kinds of meat from asada to lengua. So you won't be limited to only one particular kind of meat.

The tacos are seriously STUFFED with meat, onions, cilantro, and sometimes mild sauce or guacamole depending on what kind of taco you order. Just a tip for preferential purposes, you can even order corn tortillas which are somewhat bigger than the standard size tacos. Remember, you have to ask for all the sauces when you pay for your food.

On the other hand, they serve fries! Be mightily warned that the full size rack of fries is HUGE. So unless you have a somewhat normal appetite and stomach, feel free to order the full size, otherwise, I highly recommend the half rack so you can get some tacos. They have carne asada fries, but my favorite is the campechana fries. The campechana fries consist of asada and adobada(similar/identical to pastor). And included is your standard set of sour cream, onion, cilantros, guacamole, and etc. 

This is conveniently located northbound on Las Vegas Blvd ahead of Wynn/ Encore. Which makes it the perfect place to fulfill your drunchies after a night at Surrender or XS. 

So many good things to say about Tacos El Gordo but why the one subtracted star? Prices. Coming from LA, I don't think I ever paid $2 tacos. But unfortunately, I have no other choice but to pay the full admission for a single taco in order to fulfill my meticulous craving for Mexican food.
