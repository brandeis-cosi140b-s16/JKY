If you have never been here and are having trouble with the menu I suggest you start off by listening to pitbull song. Cabeza, lengua and other cow body parts can easily be explained through him. Some head and tongue tacos never sounded too bad! :p
If the thought of eating these things disgust you, do not be afraid and just try it! It is not as bad as you think! I was so happy to know that the "guac is not extra" here! The unfortunate part is that the food is actually pretty descent, but what is up with the guacamole! It looks and tastes like green paste! C'mon! :p
