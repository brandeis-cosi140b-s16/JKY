Most legitimate tacos, ever!

It's effectively the same tacos that you get from a taco truck, in a restaurant. However, taco trucks tend to be a bit cheaper by a few cents per taco. For a grown adult, roughly 4 tacos can fill you up, which is about $8 without drinks. 

I do not recommend the Taco De Sesos! Thats beef brain tacos. And it smells funny, and tastes like... unflavored tofu or something. And I hate tofu. 

But everything else is great! I don't know what that green sauce is, but I see little onion bits in it. Whenever possible, request more green stuff on your tacos!

The neighborhood around is sort of shady, the shopping center where this one is located is surrounded by liquor stores and smoke shops. However! It is a better spot than the 2nd location on Charleston, which is surrounded by bail bonds and pawn shops. 

The people that work here can speak a limited amount of English, so for people that want to practice their Spanish, remember this line...

"Yo quiero _______ tacos de _______"

Where the first blank is the number (uno, dos, tres, quattro, cinco, etc.) and the second blank is the type of taco. Carne for example, means beef, and etc. You can just read it off the menu.
