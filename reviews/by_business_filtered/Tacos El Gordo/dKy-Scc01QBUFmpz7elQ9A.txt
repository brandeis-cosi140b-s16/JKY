This has become our favorite destination for street tacos and today's visit did not disappoint.  We each ordered our usual - one soda plus a pair each of the adobada (spicy pork) tacos topped with crema, cilantro, pineapple and onion. I requested a complimentary side order of grilled peppers and scallions, but ended up only eating the scallions.  Fresh, tasty and just the right size for a light snack or lunch.
