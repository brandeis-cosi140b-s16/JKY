My favorite spot to hit up after a day at EBC! 

When you exit the day club, head down the stairs on the right on to the strip and go north (yes, north - away from all the hotels) for a block.  This will be located in a strip mall on your right!

Here's how it works: there are different "stations" for different meats.  You stand in line for the meat that you want to order (asada and adobada are at different stations), you order, they make it for you on the spot, and then you take it to the cashier to pay.  

I usually order a mix of 3-4 tacos and tostadas.  The fries are tempting but I haven't tried them yet.  The asada tostada is my favorite - I like that the tostada gives it a crunch vs. the corn taco shell.  The adobada is pretty fricking good too, with the cilantro cream sauce and some diced pineapples.  YUM!  I've heard the lengua is good but I have never tried it.

BTW, if you don't make it out here in Vegas, the original (?) is in Chula Vista in San Diego.  If you're in the area, it's definitely worth the drive down to almost the border for it!
