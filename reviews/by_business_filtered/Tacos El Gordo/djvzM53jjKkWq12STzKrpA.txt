So I was in Vegas with my wife. We didn't want to spend $50+ on overpriced, average food (if you haven't noticed the prices on food in restaurants in Vegas has gotten outrageous).   So I checked out yelp for some good cheap eats. Tacos El Gordo pops up as the #1 or #2 spot. We decide what the hell, let's go check it out. 

Verdict: not only is their Adobada pork taco the best taco I've ever had, their Adobada pork sope was even more ridiculous. Look, i eat Mexican a lot. My wife is Mexican and I know authentic Mexican food. This place shits on every taco you've ever had. It's that good. The carne asada was above average but in hindsight I wish I would have skipped it and gotten more Adobada tacos or sopes. If you don't know what a sope is, try one. It's basically a soft, fat corn tortilla. It's like a gordita (and no, not like a taco bell gordita; those don't remotely resemble a real gordita). 

If you want to eat for under $25 for two, eat the best taco or sope you'll ever have, and impress your friends with some real local knowledge... Eat at Tacos El Gordo. And after you eat and hit the casinos/clubs and you're sloppy drunk, go back and eat more. That's what I did. If there were one of these where I live I'd eat there 365 days a year and that's no bullshit. It's that good people. I think the meat is roasted by a crack pipe. It's seriously addicting.  I would consider giving up sex and becoming a priest to eat it daily.  If I were on death row I'd ask for Tacos El Gordo for my last meal.  If aliens landed tomorrow I'd take them to Tacos El Gordo to show them human cuisine and I'm pretty sure I would save the planet from total annihilation because they'd know the human race is rad because we can cook the shit out of some pork. 

Don't be a dummy, just do as I say and eat there. You can thank me later.
