I have been a frequent of Tacos El Gordo ever since I visited their location on the Las Vegas Strip.  However to my dismay they closed it down for reasons unknown, so now I have to make the 4mile trip to this location... which I do gladly, only I wish they still had it on the strip because now I have to work harder to convince my friends who haven't been here to make the trip!

My favorites are adobada, lengua, sesos, carne asada, and all of them simply PERFECTION!  $2 each, and I can't get myself to eat less than 6-10 of them when I'm here.  Do not miss the chance to come to this place.  You will not regret it.
