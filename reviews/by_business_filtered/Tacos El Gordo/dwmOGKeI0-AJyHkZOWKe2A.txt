For a more mature palette, stay away from Del Taco and Taco Bell and visit Tacos el Gordo, because let's face it; unless you're high or a 16 year old girl with a eating disorder there's no reason for you to bear the burden of 79 cent chulupas. Make the trip; you won't be disappointed. Try the brains, intestines, or head. And if you're upset that they are priced at 2$ a piece, I'm sure you'll find Taco Bell a more suitable establishment... Just don't forget to have you're girlfriend hold you're hair back when you purge yourself behind the dumpster in the parking lot.
