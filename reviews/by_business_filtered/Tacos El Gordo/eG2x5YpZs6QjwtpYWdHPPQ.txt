I have been hearing soooo much about this place! I just don't live close so I never thought to make the drive! Well.. I happen to be in the area last week for some training my company has going on! My co workers insisted on taking me here! Yikes! They get so busy to the point that people are literally lined out the door! Without knowing that they do allow calling in the order we stood in line for approximately 21 minutes! Was it worth it? Absolutely! They are by far better than robertos and they offer a more authentic Mexican taste! I think it's quite fascinating how they have this adobada spinning around on this wheel now personally I don't care for watching the meet spinning around like that with the guy shaving the meat sections off with this huge hunting knife lol but it's nothing a little prayer before the meal wing solve! The fries were awesome and I most definitely will be returning continuously!
