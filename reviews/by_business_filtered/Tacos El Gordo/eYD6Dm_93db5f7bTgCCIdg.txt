I was generous in rating this place four stars. Nevertheless I really do like the tacos and asada fries. 

Bought 1 asada taco, 2 adobada tacos, 1 chorizo taco, and carne asada fries. Yes I do eat a lot so please excuse my endless appetite.

The tacos were delicious! Very well cooked and they pound it with guacamole, which I'm not used to since they don't do that in LA at your standard taco stand. But it's nice for a change. The adobada is practically the same as pastor.. Marinated pork. The sauces on the other hand were good but not great. Nothing too special but nothing beats spicing up that Mexican quench in your mouth!

The one thing I dislike about this place is the price. $2 for a single taco... and they charge you tax too, so technically even more than that. Maybe I'm just too used to $1 tacos from my hometown but that is pretty greedy of the Gordo management.

This is located in a pretty dead and shady neighborhood so be warned. I also kept getting stared at in which, I guess is cause I was the only Asian there. Asian or Mexican, it doesn't matter. I can eat more Mexican food than your everyday Hispanic person.
