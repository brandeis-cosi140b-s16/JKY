My friend raved about this place after her boyfriend took her here. I'm so glad she took me!! The mula is amazing, it's like a stuffed taco quesadilla, it's awesome!! The carne asada & abodaba are worth the drive for me to go here!! The prices are also awesome, lots of food for cheap!!!! You have to go here!
