If you can handle the riff raff of the Vegas strip it's worth a visit. The Taco selection is pretty basic and authentic so if your a Traditional Taco Stand fan make sure you swing by for a quick drunk dinner. The flavor is amazing so I would recommend trying every taco if you have the stomach and you like trying interesting things. 

I think Andrew Zimmerman and Anthony Bourdain would both have something good to say about this place. 

Good late night grub at a low price.
