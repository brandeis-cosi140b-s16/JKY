As crazy as it sounds to go to a taco place while in Vegas you should give this place a try. It is the best taco outside of Mexico. Take it from me in a professional Mexican. It will be packed so be prepared to wait and one line per meat choice is crazy.

Update. Going back to Vegas for Tacos straight from the airport. Gordo, open up a place in the Bay Area.
