The line was crazy when we came here on the Thursday night before EDC weekend. You have to order different tacos at different sections of the restaurant. The first line to the left when you enter the doors is for beef tacos, the line on the right next to it we got the spicy abodaba taco, on the corner of that on the right is the lengua taco, and then the carne asada fries on right of that section.  Confusing but you'll probably see it when you enter the restaurant. We ordered half a carne asada fries and it was definitely enough for two people along with 3 lengua, 1 beef, and 1 adobada taco. The tacos ranged from $2-2.50 and the half of carne asada was only $5. We also ordered a horchata which was good too! Seatings are outdoors and we found seats pretty quick but it was so humid sitting outside. Will be back since it wasn't too expensive compared to other restaurants on the strip.
