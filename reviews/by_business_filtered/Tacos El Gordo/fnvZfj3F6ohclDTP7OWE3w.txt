Definitely would recommend, especially if you're visiting Vegas to step away from the strip and try this place out. However, this isn't just a place you stop by for a quick bite, make time in your busy itinerary. The lines will be long, but so worth the wait! 

We got 3 pastor, 2 chorizo and 1 asada. The pastor was definitely my favorite and  probably the best I've ever had. The meat was juicy with a slight tang and paired perfectly with the crispy and greasy, but not too greasy corn tortillas. The chorizo meat was tender and had that fresh off the grill taste. The asada was good too, but not much more.

Each taco costs $2, which in my opinion isn't too bad, considering you're inside with seating, although limited. Most taco trucks sell for about $1.
