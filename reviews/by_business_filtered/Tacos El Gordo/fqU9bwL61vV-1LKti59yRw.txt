A co worker told me about this spot before I came to Vegas. We love tacos so of course we had to try them! It's a small place in a shopping area next to the Riviera. We ordered the asada and adobada tacos. The asada tacos were ok, tortillas were freshly made right in front of you but, the meat didn't have too much flavor. The adobada tacos were so yummy! Full of flavor! I would definitely recommend the adobada tacos! Be prepared to wait bc the lines are long!
