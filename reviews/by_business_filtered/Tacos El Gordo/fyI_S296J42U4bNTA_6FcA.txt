Food was great, but the other customers were extremely pushy and rude. Luckily, the cook realized they were trying to pass us in line, and told them they were to wait. Very authentic food -- but not enough seating inside. We had to eat outside, and when it's 117 degrees, it's hard to enjoy anything outside. Would visit again...on a cooler day!
