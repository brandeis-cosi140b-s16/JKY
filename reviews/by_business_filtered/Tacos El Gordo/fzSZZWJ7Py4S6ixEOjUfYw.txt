YUM! How can you not like this place? We have visited at least two or three times during each of our Vegas trips and will continue to do so. Cheap, delicious, open ridiculously late (yay Vegas!) and the workers are so friendly. I am not normally a lengua fan but oh my god, the lengua fries and tacos are like an orgasm in your mouth.
