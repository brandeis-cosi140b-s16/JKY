Tacos El Gordo , the best mexican tacos in Las Vegas. A plus if your visiting out of town and craving tacos and or quesadillas . My favorite are  the steak quesadillas with the homemade flor tortillas by the way they also have corn tortillas. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming . This place is always packed and a line out the door . It gets and deserves 5 stars. Keep up the good job
