Two white girls walk into a taco bar...

Okay, so I'm not white, but pretty darn close, especially when I walk into a place like this. I've never wanted to know how to speak Spanish so badly in my life...yet my bilingual skills are no bueno. 

So anyways, how did we end up here for lunch with our four kids? I'll tell you how. I walked by this place multiple times, to and from our hotel. I stopped one night and looked at the menu. I was tempted to go inside and order, but I didn't. Anytime of day that I walked by there, there was always people there. It could be 11AM or 11PM, always a line. That's another good indicator of good food. 

Finally, on our last day in Vegas, we decided to eat at this spot. Looking at the menu, I had decided that I wanted the al pastor tacos, my friend went with it and wanted the same. The kids got quesadillas and french fries. While trying to figure out what I wanted to eat, I realized that you have to stand in the the right line for the type of meat you want. I was able to order the quesadillas and french fries with the guy once I got there. 

It's pretty good food, I enjoyed the tacos I had. My kids were satisfied with their food too. I mean, you can't really complain, $30 for six people's lunches...one of the better deals on the strip. I'd visit here again, these tacos sure beat Jack In the Box tacos after you've partied a little too hard, haha.
