The food is good and very authentic.. However...... On my visit today( it's been like 6 weeks) today me and my bf came for lunch.. The tacos are on a smaller tortilla and :) thy no longer double the tortilla because you won't get as full of course so you'll buy more!!! Morale of the story another greedy ass company!! Smh
