This place is an excellent place if you are mexican and missing your tacos. I'm mexican and got to say this restaurant is more mexican then beans and wetbacks, they have food at great price, its clean, they have natural flavored water like jamaica, horachata, and naranjada. The price ranges from 2-3 dlls in tacos, 8-15 dlls in carne asada fries, and their attitude is great, eventhough non of the cooks speak spanish. they have tacos, carne asada fries, tostadas, even tacos de chorizo and that is even rare in mexican taco shops, they have cebollitas asadas and chiles tatemados. It"s great for the money.
