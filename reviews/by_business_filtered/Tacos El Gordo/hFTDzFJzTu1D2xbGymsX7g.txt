I used to tell my wife" come on there not all that" when I was urged to go to El Gordos. Ok.I am no.longer in denial. Best tacos in Vegas. First timers and newbies stick with the Adobada with the green sauce. Bomb.com Mulitas, Adobada fries and tacos...all excellent
 There is a reason this place is always packed when every shop around it is empty. Cabesa is pretty good too. EVERY time we go to Vegas I stop by here.
