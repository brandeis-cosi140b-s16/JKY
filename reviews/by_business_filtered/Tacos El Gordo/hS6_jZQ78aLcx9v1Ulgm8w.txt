VIP service at a hole in the wall, really Mexican taco joint? You bet.

I first tried going to their location on the strip near Wynn but after I parked my car and walked around in circles I was disappointed to find out they closed that location recently. Thank god they still have this one!

As I walked in, the place was not surprisingly packed. Each 'station' line was snaking. That will never deter me, even if it went out the door.

I stood in the offal line. You know the good stuff: tongue, cheek, tripe. After maybe 30 seconds, a smiley and guapa staff member came up to me in line and asked what I wanted. I told her what I wanted and she tells me "no need to wait in line, let me go get your tacos". Before she heads to the back she clears off a counter and makes a table for me (there were no tables available). Score.

Maybe it was because I was the only one somewhat dressed up (just a sport jacket), maybe she mistaken me for someone else. All I know is Te Amo Gordo Senorita.
