Love this place. I moved to Las Vegas 3 years ago and remember eating the best tacos at tacos el gordo in TJ and San Diego, and had not been able to find good tacos out here. However, when I realize that had tacos el gordo here I decided to give them a try and so glad I have. They are just like the real thing. A little more expensive that other taco places but so worth it. It worth the commute as well cuz I live in north las vegas.
