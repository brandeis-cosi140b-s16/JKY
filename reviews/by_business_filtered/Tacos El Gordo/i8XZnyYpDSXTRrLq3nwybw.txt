I have seen this place popping up on yelp and decided to look through the reviews and pictures. I was happy to learn about the 2 separate lines since I would be wanting both asada and adobada and thanks to Nelson Q's picture that I can add pineapple to my taco.

The seating inside this location is limited. They have 2 tent type things outside were you can eat. If my memory isn't too foggy this location used to be a taco bell when I was a teenager. The car clubs would hang out in this parking lot and drink etc. Well, the parking lot being ghetto fabulous hasn't changed a bit. Maybe more ghetto then anything. The inside was kinda chaotic. I know it is on the strip so a lot of tourists especially drunk ones are going to want some of these $2.00 crack tacos. They are addicting and delicious! I like that I can get adobada tacos on either side. They have more then one line for the same thing since they get so busy at times.

There is a parking lot so if you can find a spot then you can just go back and eat in your car if you can't find a spot at the tables.
