Tacos El Gordo is the only authentic Mexican food shop I would recommend in Vegas. The lines may be ridiculously long and all of the seating may be outdoors, but the food is worth it. The meat is sliced right in front of you and you can get all the extras (like pineapple) for free.
Each line is for a different type of meat. Make sure to read the signs! I hate being in restaurants where I don't understand the menu/how to order/what to order. Tacos El Gordo is exactly that, so bring a friend that knows what they're doing! The tacos are small-- 10 tacos for a guy is a good start.
