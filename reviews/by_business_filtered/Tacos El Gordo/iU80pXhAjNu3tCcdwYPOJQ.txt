Ding ding ding! Winner winner taco dinner.

Do you like tacos? Of course you do, everyone does. This place is the bee's knees man. Went here on a Saturday night, and while it was busy, the service was quick, the food was fresh, and the taste was superb. Would I go back? Indeed I would, and I will. 

I highly recommend the Pork Quesadilla, a little pricier than the $2 tacos at $4, but twice the size and twice the meat, well worth it. Not traditional though, it comes with cheese, grilled green onions (yum!), salsa (fresh and spicy, so gooooood), and  some sort of sour cream-ish type sauce (also awesome), and topped with a tostada shell (small, but a little extra crunchiness never hurt anyone). Everything is made right in front of you, including the corn tortillas. I had both carne asada and the spicy pork, both of them spectacular. Saw someone else eating the carne asada fries, and while $10 is a bit pricey, it's probably worth it given the portion size. 

Looking forward to going back and getting more Gordo.
