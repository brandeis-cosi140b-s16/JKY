Amazing tacos. I've never been to a place like this. The tacos are super authentic. The people there make everything fresh by hand. You can get in one of three of lines, depending on what kind of meat you want. The choices were excellent but if you're looking for chicken, you won't find them here. The fries were also really excellent. If you go with two people, order size small. The portion is huge.
