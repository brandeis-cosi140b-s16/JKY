Cheap good tacos is why my husband and I come here.  We splurge on lunch and come here for a quick bite before a show.  I have to say the quality of their meat is pretty darn good it's not all full of fat and gristle.  We tried a variety of tacos and a mula which is a quesadilla with meat. At $2 a pop you can't go wrong. Seating can be a problem sometimes it can get pretty crowded, they also have outdoor seating but with the heat I prefer the ac. It's a noisy hole in the wall but I like those kind of places.  It is clean,tidy and we at least make 2 stops here while in Vegas.
