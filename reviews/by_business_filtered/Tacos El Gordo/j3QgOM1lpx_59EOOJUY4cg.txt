Yummy! Just like the other tacos el Gordo on the border of sd & Mexico. I thoroughly enjoyed their adobada & tripa. I think they might even put more meat than I'm used to. Prices are comparable as well. It definitely hit the spot for me & my husband.  Make sure to try their spicy pork, my favorite! If you're not a soda drinker, bring your own water since they don't have any except bottled.
