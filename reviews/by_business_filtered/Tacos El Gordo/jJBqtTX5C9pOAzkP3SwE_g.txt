Back when I was a ye lad, my family and I used to go to Tijuana, Mexico at least 6 times a year. We would stop at this taco stand named Tacos El Gordo. It was some of the best tacos I have ever had. And my first time having a mula (it's like a small sandwich of tortillas with cheese, guacamole salsa and choice of meat). I always wanted them to be in the states. 

I came to Vegas a few years ago and I was driving down Las Vegas Blvd, I can't believe my eyes! Tacos El Gordo! I immediately stopped and ordered my tacos.  Wow! Tasted the same as the small stand in Mexico! And they hand make their tortillas. 

It's in a small plaza passing the Encore. Parking is sufficient. Outdoor and indoor eating areas. You have to order first and then pay. Your wait is a while, but well worth it! You have to stop here and eat!
