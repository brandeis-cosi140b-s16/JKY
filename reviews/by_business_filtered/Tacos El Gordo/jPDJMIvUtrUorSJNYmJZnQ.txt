Came here after lounging at Tao beach all day. Between my sister and I, we ordered:

3 lengua tacos
3 spicy pork tacos
1 campachana fries
2 coke zeros--you know, cuz we're trying to watch our figures.

I loves me some pork so of course I ordered the adobado (sp) tacos for myself. I thought they were really good, however I don't think they are as good as the al pastor from Tacos Mexico. The ones there come very greasy and seemed to be slow cooked amongst ingredients such as onions that you can clearly see on the taco (aside from the toppings). I love the greasy, juiciness of that type of marinated pork. It seems I've only been able to find them at Tacos Mexico.

Anyhow, my sister and I swapped a taco and that lengua taco on MY lengua blew my mind! So tender and juicy! I already thought I discovered the best lengua tacos in town (Super B Burrito) over by Eastern and St Rose so I didn't have high expectations. God, I love it when I'm proven wrong in that sense.

The campachana fries were delish with half of it topped with carne asada and the other with the spicy pork. All in all, great food especially after sitting under the sun getting drunk. The restaurant was very clean, as well as the bathroom. I can't wait for my next excuse to be on the strip so we can stop by again.
