Taco-flavored kisses for Tacos El Gordo!

Despite the number of time I've been to Vegas, I wouldn't consider myself a "Vegas person." I dunno, everything on the strip seems to run together after a while, and you can't really tell the difference between this place and that. Enter Tacos El Gordo! You have to walk a bit away from the action to get to it - just north of the Wynn and Encore, Tacos El Gordo is located in a weird little strip mall next to a souvenir shop. They have seating indoor and out.

When I walked in, I was faced with a food station directly in front of me and a cashier to my right, horchata/bang/soda machine on the left. I was totally confused as to where to order and how to pay. It must have showed on my face because one of the guys behind the counter where the cooks were smiled and called to me. He took my order, barked it at the cooks and told me to wait there, then pay when I got my food. I was totally surprised at how cheerful all the employees where. Great customer service is definitely not something I seek out when I'm eating at hole in the walls, but every employee greeted me with a smile and was happy to serve me. When the cook handed over my food, he asked to make sure the order was right, gave me a big smile and told me to enjoy. I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.

I had the carne asada fries, an asada taco, chicken quesadilla, and an a pork taco (I was sharing with a friend OKAY?). Everything was perfectly delicious. The carne asada fries were huge, enough to feed 2 to 3, possibly 4 people. The tacos come overflowing with meat, and the horchatas and bang juices are refillable. Woohoo! I felt like I struck gold with this place. And our whole bill was only $20. I think it was the least amount of money I had spent on a meal that satisfying in Vegas. If you're looking for some good, cheap Mexican food on the strip, drive or walk a little further, Tacos El Gordo is worth it.
