It is pretty much the best Mexican Food for quick eats such as your Tacos, Quesadillas, and such. I love their Tacos de Asada by the way as they are cooked with real Ranchera meat, which is the best meat to cook for tacos. They have a location on the Strip as well, but this is also the spot for those who want to be away from the Strip, especially for locals there. I have to say it has an awesome taste!
