Ultimate Addiction! 

If you want street tacos, this is the best place to find them! The spicy pork tacos, are heaven. I normally order the mula version, which cost $4. It's the best bang for your buck. This is a great place open 247 on the strip if you are starting or finishing partying for the night.
