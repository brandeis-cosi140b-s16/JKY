I didn't get anything to get here because I was recovering from food poisoning. But my BF got the spicy pork tacos and he said they were the best tacos he's ever had. This place is authentic and the long lines and people show that it is really good. He gives 5 stars for that.

However, one has to ask whether it's worth the 50+ minute wait. The lines bring down the rating from 5 stars to 3 stars. The queuing system was really confusing. As others have mentioned, there are separate lines for everything. There are six lines, two sets of three lines. The three lines are for pork (abodaba), offal (brains, tongue, stomach, tripe, intestines, etc), and beef (asada, etc). The line didn't actually look that long so it was ridiculous how it took so long. 

As we got closer, we found out why. It's because there was one guy doing the job of two people. He makes the tacos really fast but he would have to make like at least 5 for each customer. Also, he made like 50+ tacos while we were in line that looked like it was for to-go orders (paper plates wrapped in foil). So the amount of time per person and the amount of extra work the taco maker is doing for people not in line contributes to long wait times. It feels like there has to be a better way for them to do this!
