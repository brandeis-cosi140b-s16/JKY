Finally! This location took forever to built, but boy was it worth the wait. This location has more seating than the other locations. Different lines for different meats. The Al Pastor is Always the most popular meat. The tacos here are the closest to Mexico that I've ever had. Highly recommended. Although the tacos aren't expensive at $2 a pop, they do get pricey when ordering more due to its addictive nature. The Al pastor is by far the best! Don't forget to ask for pineapple, grilled onions and peppers. 

Also because this location is new - it's much cleaner than the other locations. Love that this is so close to my home!!!! Best location in town!
