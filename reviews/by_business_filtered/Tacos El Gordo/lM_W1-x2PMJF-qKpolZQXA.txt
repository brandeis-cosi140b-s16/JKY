Wait... Whaaat? Cheap late night eats on the strip!!

Each delicious taco is $2.00 which is kinda expensive for your typical street taco but considering that it is Vegas, these prices are cheap and well worth it! The abobado (spicy pork) and carne asada tacos are so flavorful and tender.  And I especially love that the carne asada tacos come with guacamole!

********WARNING********

The roasted jalapeno peppers are SPICYYYY!  Just sample it first or the tears will come!
