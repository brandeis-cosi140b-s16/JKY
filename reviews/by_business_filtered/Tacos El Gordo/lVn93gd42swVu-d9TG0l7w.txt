Strayed away from the convention center and big name palatial casinos to take a break from all the overpriced nonsense and corporate types.  I felt comfortable at Tacos El Gordo, the service was fast, and the steak and spicy pork tacos were excellent.  I'm glad I checked this place out and am going to make it a place I come to every time I'm in Vegas from now on.
