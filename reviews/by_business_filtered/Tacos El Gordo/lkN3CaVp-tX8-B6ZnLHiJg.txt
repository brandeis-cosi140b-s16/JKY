I love greasy tongue tacos. I love them on occasion and sometimes on Sundays. 

I love tongue tacos and that is all I will ever order from here. It's not to say that I wouldn't have anything else- it's just that my diet doesn't allow for so much grease...so when I come to a taqueria I make sure I get as slippery as I can *ssSSLURRRP*!!! 
I get my tacos as fast as I would get them in the heart of mehee-co..

I love beef- gimme that beef tongue in between two tiny corn tortillas...con pico y mucho cilantrrrrro. OMG tongue tacos for DAYS! It will be a while until I have another slimy and onion crunchy tongue taco but that day can wait....
                                                                           I prefer to keep my girlish figure...anyways. GET your tacos COME and get your tongue tacos (or whatever it is you may want..) COME and get your sugar packed horchata...GET it here...GET it now!! AY YA YAY (I'm allowed to do this...I have proof)
