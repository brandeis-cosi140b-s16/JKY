cant believe how any times I had been to Vegas and never heard of these tacos! A couple people mentioned this place to us during our visit in June and we decided to check it out. Its a bit far down in the strip like f you were heading downtown. the tacos were so delicious and if I remember correctly they were only $2! Will be getting some more next time I am in town.
