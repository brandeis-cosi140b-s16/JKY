******** TACO SEARCH OVER **********

Are you a basketball fan?  Do you remember when Vince Carter played his only time in the slam dunk contest, threw down his first, thunderous dunk, and stared into the audience, motioning with his hand slitting his throat and mouthed...................."It's Over"

That is how i felt after i took my first bite of their Spicy Pork adoboda taco.
The search for Vegas's Best Taco has ended.  It's over.

I didn't think it was possible to get an authentic taco in this town.  I been to the self proclaimed "Robertos" and the other has-beens where frankly after tonight I'd feed it all to a dog.

We got the cabeza (beef head), lengua (tongue), and the spicy pork adoboda.  When you arrive, there is a secret way of ordering, kind of like In-and-Out.  Based on the meat choice you want, you go to line 1, 2, or 3.

The line closest to the door is where it is at yo..Spicy pork goodness.  Be sure to hit up every line and get your grilled scallions and peppers in line 1.  

BEst of all, this place is open till 4am on the weekends.
