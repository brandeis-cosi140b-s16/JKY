Spicy pork/adobada is so good!! Moist and so flavorful. The avocado sauce (I think it's avo sauce) is so amazing too! 

At 1:30AM it wasn't too bad of a line. Waited maybe 20 minutes. But it's worth it! There's separate lines for each type of meat you want so read that before standing in line. Wish they had chicken, but only beef and pork )= They ask you what you want and if you want all the toppings (cilantro, onions, avo sauce). You order, they give you the food, you walk to the back and pay. It's efficient. They'll put foil over it when u pay if you're doing to-go. There's a tented area in the front to sit and eat but it's crowded. 

Since we went at night the heat inside wasn't too bad, but there is NO air conditioner. Just fans, so it's stuffy. Probably so bad during the day time in the summer. No water out or anything either, and drunk people and heat don't mix well.  Saw a drunk guy totally pass out and hit the floor waiting in line. Heard a big thump when his head hit :/ he got up with a huge bump on his head and they called an ambulance. Hope you're okay whoever you are! Too bad you didn't get to try the amazing tacos.
