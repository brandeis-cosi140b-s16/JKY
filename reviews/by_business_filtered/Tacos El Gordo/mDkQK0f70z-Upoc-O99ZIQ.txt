BELIEVE THE HYPE

I have lived in San Diego and visited Mexico multiple times. If you are looking for good, authentic mexican street eats, Tacos El Gordo is the spot. Whether you are a tourist or local, you have to visit this place at least once when in the area. Located next to the Encore, there is free parking either at the Encore on in their parking lot (I visited at 1am, so parking was abundant, but the lot is on the small side).

What I ordered (you can ref pic in gallery):
- Taco Asada (Beef) $2
- Taco Adobada (Spicy Pork) $2
- Taco Lengua (Beef Tounge) $2
- Mula Lengua (Quesadilla) $4 *Flour tortilla, but can get corn
- Fountain Drink (Orange Bang) Free refills $1

I ordered all items with everything, as I wanted to try them as they should be. At first, the portions seem on the small side, but let me tell you, they are generous with the meat and it is filling.

Each item prepared fresh before your eyes. Service was friendly and very helpful seeing as it was my first time there, and spoke enough english to get the point accross. Establishment was very clean. All the meat was chopped evenly and tender. The various toppings complimented the corresponding meats perfectly. The flavors blending together were magical. If I hadn't just lost 95 pounds, I would have ordered another round of tacos, or three, and a few more mulas. Should have probably used a fork and knife for the mula, but it was 1am, was oozing cheesy goodness, and was ripe for consumption so I folded in half like a giant taco and went to work on it. I'm craving one right this moment.

Whether it is lunch, dinner, or a late night hunger fix, you need to go to Tacos El Gordo if you are anywhere near one. Highly recommended.
