If you find yourself in this parking lot and are starring down both Los Tacos and Tacos El Gordo..go to Tacos El Gordo.  Don't let the fact that Spanish is the predominate language spoken discourage you.  Don't let the fact that this doesn't look like Robertos or Taco Bell freak you out.  This place has the best taco I have ever had.  They have this gigantic spicy pork mountain that they carve stuff out of and it really and truly is like a Hispanic cloud of bliss which flies forth and brings taco happiness to everyone.  Again I emphasize that this is a very very ethnic place so don't go here if you expect tex-mex or Americanized Mexican food.  If you really truly want to try something Mexican though, go here.  It...is....awesome.
