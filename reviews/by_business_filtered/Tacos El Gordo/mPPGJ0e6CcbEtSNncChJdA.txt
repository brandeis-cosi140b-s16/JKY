I wish so so so badly that this restaurant was in Utah! They had the best tacos EVER! My husband and I loved the steak tacos very fresh and tortillas made right in front of you. However the spicy pork taco took the cake. They cut the pork right off this spit with a pineapple above it to add flavor and juices. By far the best taco I've had in a long time. Don't be discouraged by the craziness of the place either everyone just wants there tacos. Just go up to the counter and tell them what you want yummmm! Talk about a best thing I ever ate moment.
