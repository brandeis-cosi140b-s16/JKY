I'm from Los Angeles CA, and even though we have some amazing taco trucks, I think these might just be the best tacos I have had in my life. The spicy pork (adobada) - but called pastor elsewhere, is knock your socks off fantastic. The chorizo and pork shoulder are great as well. I was adventurous and even tried the beef brain (sesos) and the beef head (cabeza). The brain is super unique,. It is extremely tender, almost mushy, and has a nice gamey aftertaste. The cabeza has more of a shredded beaf kind of texture, think pulled pork, but with some gaminess as well. I wouldn't order either again, but they were fun to try.
