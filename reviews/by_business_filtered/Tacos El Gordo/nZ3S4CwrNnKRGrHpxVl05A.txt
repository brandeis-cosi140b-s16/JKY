We frequent the Charleston location of this chain on almost every trip, but this was our first opportunity to dine here.  The restaurant is located in a run down shopping center that I would normally avoid, but we were here for the food.  Prior to entering, we noticed a large tent immediately outside the door with tables which was packed with diners.  Additional seating is available inside. We encountered long lines and slow service, but the food was excellent.  We shared our standard meal of 4 adobada street tacos and a pina colada, non alcoholic drink.
