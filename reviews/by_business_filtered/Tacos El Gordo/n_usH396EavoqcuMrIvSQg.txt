This is the taco place that got me to fall in love with Mexican food! Well, the original location that was on the Strip was the one, but this location didn't falter to please. 
My sister and I had gotten a craving to come here since we hadn't been for awhile, and we were jealous that the little brother got to go without us... Sister Date! Anyway...
The ordering is pretty much the same, you pick a line with the meat you want, then tell them how you want it. My sister got to try Lengua (beef tongue) tacos, and we also ordered Adobada (pork) fries. The all the toppings still taste as fresh as can be. Both orders were fully loaded. Hahaha... Eating here can get messy, so ask for extra napkins. My sister was also surprised that she enjoyed the lengua: "Taste more like regular beef than anything different, and texture isn't bad." Took awhile for the fries, but it came out fresh so there aren't any gripes there, plus they still loaded it with the pork. 
Oh man... We over-ordered though 'cause we forgot how big of the fries was, which was 1 entire to-go container. I helped her with about 3/4 of that thing, and we were supposed to half it! Shouldn't have ordered the tacos as well, but man... It was worth it! Our cravings are more than satisfied! 
Customer service is still good. Nice guys when you order up at the counter, and the ladies are always friendly when you pay. This location was pretty clean and not as busy as the closed Strip location, but we did go around 2PM. The seating area was good too, taking up more room than the original location. I don't recall any outdoor seating though. Only thing I wish they had was Jarritos soda.
