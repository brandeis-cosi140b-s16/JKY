Tacos El Gordo changed my life.

Ah, I'm just kidding (kind of). But I went here late on a Sunday night because I had taken my good friend from out of town to Double Down Saloon and afterward we were both having those late night, been out too long drinking pains. He said directly to me: "Take me somewhere that has crazy good, original Mexican food."

I immediately thought of Tacos El Gordo and it's perfect because it is about a 5 minute drive from my house. When we got there it wasn't too busy so  we were able to go straight up and order. Note that when you order you go to different people because they are all slicing different kinds of meat.

I went for the adobada, of course because I've seen all the great reviews of it. It was so good I ordered two, but then I went back and got another. The sauce on it has such a great taste and yes, you can get pineapples on it, but I do not like pineapples - so none for me!

My friend branched out, got an adobada taco, carne asada taco, and an adobada quesadilla. He gave me a taste of the quesadilla and it was just as good as the tacos.

I definitely will be back to try the other tacos. It's such an easy concept and for some reason I really like places that specialize in just a few things these days. It means they can really hone in on making something really delicious, rather than doing a bunch of mediocre stuff. It's just tacos here (and a few other things), but the TACOS are what you go for. I'm talking just real good tacos.
