Quick tip: The line on the  middle right is for pork tacos only but you can still get carne asada fries there and believe me folks, you want those fries. 

Some people have acid flashbacks, I had a taco flashback to being 18 and partying it up in Rosarito beach and eating a delicious drunky taco. 100%, totally, undeniably legit pork tacos. I love that people say that the carne asada fries are "really big, enough for 2-3 people," yeah or enough for one drunk person at 3am. 

We came on a Monday at 2pm and the line went out the door. Be willing to wait, your taste buds will thank you for it.

Twenty bucks will buy you four tacos, one carne asada fries and two drinks. Where else in Vegas will you eat this good for that cheap? That was a rhetorical question.

Last note: Leave the staff a tip, they work their asses off and do it with a huge smile.
