BEST TACOS I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE PERIOD! This is coming from a girl that is married to a Mexican straight from Mexico. None of my in laws speak english except for one sister. My mom in law makes the best mexican food ever but tacos el gordo has her beat when it comes to tacos. I'm sorry mom! This is a must visit when coming to Vegas! Totally worth the $60 cab ride over here! You need to bring at least 4 people with you so that you can get food from all 3 lines. The 4th person needs to help get a table because finding a seat in here is like finding gold in a gold mine. I can't wait to come back later this year with my husband! I love living in Hawaii, but not having legit Mexican food SUCKS!
