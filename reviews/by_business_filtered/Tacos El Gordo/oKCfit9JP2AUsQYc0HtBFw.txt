Now, this is what I call Mexican food. I am such a sucker for verde sauce, corn tortillas, and the bustling market feel that I couldn't help but follow the hype. There are a few things on the menu that I have never heard of like Vampiro haha. Eventually, I'll try everything because their Adobada is dericious ~ 

Try it out! It's so affordable that you could miss out on your Big Mac for a day, I'm sure!
