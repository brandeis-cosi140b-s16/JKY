They have some pretty bomb tacos here! It was really good and not too expensive either. The only thing is if you want a variety of things you have to get in a lot of different lines. Each line offers different type of meat. On the plus side, they give you free grilled onions and peppers!! The downside is that its super packed, and it takes awhile, especially if someone makes a big order. We ended up lining up for ~30min until we got to the front to order.

I ended up eating 3 tacos, a quesadilla and shared some carneasada fries. It was the perfect amount for me.
