I legit love this place!  It's definitely a go to spot after a night of partying.  I ALWAYS order a couple of the Spicy Pork tacos which I think is the best type of meat they serve.  Their Spicy Pork fries are also a great choice, but I will suggest ordering half of a full size order because even their half size fries can feed about 2-3 people.  They also provide grilled peppers and green onions for free and they go great with just about anything you're eating at the place.  

This place definitely is the best taco place in town!
