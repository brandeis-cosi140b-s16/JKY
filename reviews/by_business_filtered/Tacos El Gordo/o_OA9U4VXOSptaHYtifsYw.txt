I found out about this hidden gem while listening to the podcast Five Hundy by Midnight.  I am so glad that I decided to check it out.  It is located in a small shopping plaza between the Riviera and Encore, so it is a little bit of a hike to get to, but it is worth it.  

I had three Adobada Tacos (spicy pork) and my wife had a Steak Taco and a Beef Tongue Taco.  The tacos also came with a plate of saut√©ed scallions and hot peppers.  All the food was wonderful, plus at no more than $2.50 a taco, the price is unbeatable.  

This is a great find and I highly recommend anyone looking for an inexpensive meal to give it a try.
