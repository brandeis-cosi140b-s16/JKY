The first time I went here, a long time ago, the lines were so long and confusing because we didn't know how to handle going from each station that we just gave up and left. Now I've been to the other location on a taco crawl I knew what to expect when our friends asked us to come grab tacos here. 

We go in line for the al pastor as that was the majority of what we needed, then tipped out the station for them to get the other stations to make our other tacos simultaneously and tip out those stations as well. Or if you are in a group of friends, have someone in each line ordering for the group and split the cost among yourselves. We were here at 11ish and the line took 25 minutes. 

I had - 

Al pastor - this pastor was decent. Not too fatty, the seasonings were good. I like the avocado sauce they put on it, as well as the salsa on it. Ask for pineapple too! I think if I go here, I will probably just get this meat in various vessels (tacos, vampiros, fries, etc). 

Cabeza - there was crispy edges to this which was different. The flavor of it was just OK though and there are cabezas I far prefer around town. I noticed they dip the tortillas at this station in the grease for flavor, but that made my taco also a bit soggy. It was better the last time I had them. 

I got a plate of the green onions and peppers as well (these are free) and the green onions is probably my favorite thing about this place. 

I don't want to do this very often as I absolutely hate the cattle line system. Maybe I'm coming off like a brat, but I've stood in lines for many of foods with zero complaints as there are some things worth the inconvenience and time spent. These are good tacos, but not the greatest taco in town as they are hailed to be. Great late night spot, specially for tourists, but I will rarely visit and will go to the Charleston one if I can help it.
