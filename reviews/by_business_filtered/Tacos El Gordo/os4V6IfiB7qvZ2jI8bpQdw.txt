Their Pastor meat is GREAT, but other than that everything is mediocre at best not to mention their service organization is by far the worst I've seen, to order different meat you have to get on up to 3 different lines, so by the time your done ordering from the 2nd or 3rd line your food is cold and place has always been packed when Im there so many people end up having to wait like sharks just to find a seating spot. Will not go back here.
