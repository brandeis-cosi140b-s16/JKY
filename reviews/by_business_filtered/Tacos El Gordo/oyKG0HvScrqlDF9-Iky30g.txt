Same great food at cheap prices, and love the new location! Line is a little more chaotic and confused because its mostly tourists not used to the procedure (separate unmarked lines for the desired meat). They don't have chicken for some reason, but I always opt for beef and pork so no matter to me. 

Big issue with seating. The restaurant is half the size of the Charleston location, so there's only a few booths inside. There's a lot of booths outside, but it was raining and windy so we had to eat standing up w our trays on the trash can. The outside booths aren't covered, and someone obviously didn't think it thru - plastic and vinyl booths sitting in 100+ degree desert sun? Nobody will be able to sit there. Looks like they just opened, but they'll have to figure out a solution pretty soon (tent like at playgrounds?).
