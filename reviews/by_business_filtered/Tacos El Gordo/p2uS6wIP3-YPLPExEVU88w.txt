I went to Tacos el Gordo a couple of weeks ago because of the other yelp reviews and just had to add my 2 cents. This place has absolutely fabulous authentic taco stand food! I do have to say that I did subtract a star for the fries. I shared the adobada fries and the fries were a little limp and weren't really cooked long enough. But the adobada was wonderful! I wish I had just gotten the tacos or a burrito instead and skipped the fries.  I also had a carne asada taco that was just perfect. Overall, the food is really, really good. It can get a little hectic when it is busy, but not overly so, I don't think and I think the separate lines, besides being a necessity for the different items, also speed the process. The check out process could be a little more efficient as far as getting from the food lines to the check out, but they have two cash registers, so that is helpful. I am going back tonight because this is one of those places that once you have been, you keep thinking about when you can go back.
