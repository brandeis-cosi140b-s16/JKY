I am a fan! This place delivers on pretty much everything they promise. The people are friendly, the food is delicious and they are open late! The spicy pork is my favorite! They would be getting 5 stars from me but there are times my order is wrong. I go out of my way to repeat my order a few times to ensure accuracy..
