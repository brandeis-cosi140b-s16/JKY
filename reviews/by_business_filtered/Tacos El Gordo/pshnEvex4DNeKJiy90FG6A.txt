Long line but worth the wait!!! They have different lines based on type of meat, so bring friends if you want to try multiple things without waiting in line all night! We waited in line for asada and el pastor tacos. El pastor were my favorite, so flavorful. Asada fries we amazing too! Best tacos in Vegas!
