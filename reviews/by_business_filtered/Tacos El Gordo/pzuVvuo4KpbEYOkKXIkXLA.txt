The tacos are amazing but definitely not worth the HOUR plus wait just to order the tacos.   The ordering process is the most chaotic,  crazy thing I've ever seen. They have 3 lines for different meats.   If you want a carne asada taco and an adobado,  you have to go to two different LONG lines!   It's ridiculous.   Mind you,  this was a Tuesday night!  I do have to give credit for the tacos.   They were really good.   Would I eat there again?   I would like to  but I won't just because the ordering process and lines were just to out of control.
