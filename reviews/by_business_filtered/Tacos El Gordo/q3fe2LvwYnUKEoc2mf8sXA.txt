2 words my friends, Adobado Fries!

They take a large to-go box and fill it with thin crispy fries then they start loading on the goodies. We're talking thin porky slices of spit roasted adobado (this seems like al pastor to me but hey whatever), cheese, sour cream and guacamole. If you're really hungry I guess you could use your fingers to attack the fries from the side where there are less toppings, good luck with that. I stuck with the fork and made sure to get a little bit of everything in each bite. Dang this are good. I'd like to start calling them "Fuck Yeah Fries"! 

After a night of tiki'ing at Frankie's this is the place to nosh your buzz into a more manageable state.
