The walk from TI to Tacos El Gordo just beyond the Wynn was quite a trek (in my book) but to have these delicious tacos waiting for me at the very end was all worth it.

Upon entering, you grab a red tray and follow the signs to what kind of tacos you want to try. I got the lengua (beef tongue), carne asada, and al pastor--this is probably the same order in which I liked the tacos (from most to least). Each taco is about $2 so you can get by with a cheap Vegas meal. Love the fact that you see the meat being cooked right in front of your eyes. The tortillas are super tasty and you can tell they are made with care.

Yep, it's not quite upscale dining if you're into that for a Vegas experience but you came for the food right?
