In an ideal world, this is how it supposed to work out: 

Wait in line for few minutes, order tacos as one order, pay at the cashier, and enjoy delicious tacos.

So much for the ideal world ...

Once you walk in, you will see separate lines for different types of taco (two lines for adobada, two lines for asada, one line for fries, and ..... ONE line for beef tongue / tripe / beef shoulder). 

So I lined up and waited to get one beef tongue taco and one beef shoulder. So I waited ... and waited ... and waited ...

Why did it take so long? Oh I see, everyone was ordering at least 10+ tacos for each order. Taco El Gordo, how can you only have one line for beef tongue / should line? Anyhow, and so I waited for 30+ minutes ... 

Finally it got to my turn! And guess what? THEY RAN OUT OF BEEF SHOULDER -_-! Dude, not cool at all. I only ordered beef tongue and beef tripe tacos. 

In the end, I basically did not want to wait in another line and I just simply overpaid for a $10 carne asada fries because there was no line. Oh, did I also mention it took them another 10 minutes just to get the fries out?  

Well, these tacos better be amazing right?

tacos de lengua (beef tongue - $2.25 each) and tacos de tripa (beef tripe - $2 each): For $2 tacos, they tasted okay. Is it worth 30 minutes wait? Hell no!  

Taco de adobada (spicy pork - $2): Probably the best taco out of all three that I've ordered, but it wasn't crazily good. 

Carne asada fries ($10): Not like it was awful, just not at the price that I paid for. I still can't believe I paid $10 for somewhat average fries ($5 would be a better price). 

I will stick with my East LA tacos ... they are still the bomb and my ultimate taco standards.
