Main Foods: Tacos with Meat

Verdict: I did not know Tacos can taste like gold.

Be prepared to line for a long time cause this place is popular. There are separate lines for different types of meat so make sure you line up for the pork (my recommendation, but generally the longest line). The staff are extremely efficient though. Best go if you're in town.

Adobada: This spiced pork reminds me of the taste of Char Siu (BBQ Pork in Canto Cuisine). The warm juice flows from the pork itself and fuses with the cold sauce; the pork is well spiced and prepared as it complements the crisp yet soft tortilla. The only complain: WHY THE HELL IS THIS SO SMALL. I ordered 3 and still did not have enough of it. Going to get more the next time I go to Vegas.

I lost my memory here I only remember this as one of the beef. (Should be either Suadero or Cabeza) The beef is crispy and is a bit blander than the previous taco. But it serves as an excellent transition taco before the Adobada
