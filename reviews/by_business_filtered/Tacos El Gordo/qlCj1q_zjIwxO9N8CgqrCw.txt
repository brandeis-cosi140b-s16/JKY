I hardly ever eat Mexican food but a friend kept telling me how good this place is and also very affordable. It is open until 2am weekdays and 4am wknds, so after my late night workout i was starving so I decided to check it out.  It is not in the best area of Vegas and there is an armed metro cop on duty to diffuse any potential problems which I could definitely see something shady going down in the surrounding area. I'm sure the cop is a good thing and makes customers feel safer going there.  It was kind of a rough crowd the night that i went but then again it was a Friday night around 11 pm. If i went again which I probably would I would avoid weekend nights. The place was packed which is another good sign as far as quality. 

I had no idea what to order so I got a Quesedilla and a few Carne Asada tacos.  They were both very authentic. Some of the best mexican food I can remember having.  Especially the Quesedilla. It was so good i thought about turning around and getting another one (I did a to go order)

I would go back but realistically I do not live to close so it wont be happening anytime soon! I only give it 4 stars due to the location and surrounding area. I have to take a point away due to the fact it is in the hood with an armed Metro officer on duty. Nothing to do with the food. Food is great!
