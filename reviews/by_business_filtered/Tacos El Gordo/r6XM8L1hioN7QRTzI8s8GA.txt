This place was my go to place when I went to vegas! Probably the most legit Mexican tacos I've ever had! Their soft taco shells are made perfectly. I love the concept of having some sides to add on (they had turnips, lime, etc). I had beef, chicken, and I even tried the beef tongue and they were all delicious! This is the best taco place I've ever had and you know they are legit when the actual workers are Mexican! I love how the meat is in front of you when you order and they cut it in front of you. They make their own  taco shells and their meat are always freshly cooked.

Very impressed with the food. And the servers are great and fast. This is a self serve place so you go out to the patio and eat it outside. You also clean up after yourself. Perfect for quick snacks at late hours (definitely a go to place after night of drunkenness and clubbing).
