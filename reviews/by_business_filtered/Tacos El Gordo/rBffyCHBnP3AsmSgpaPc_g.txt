Yummy in my tummy.  Enough said.  Tacos El Gordo es muy bueno.  I wished I payed more attention in Spanish class because I could not understand most of what the cooks were saying to me.   I had only a vague idea of what I was ordering and got confused where I was supposed to order from.  But, where's the fun if there is no element of surprise.   I had the mula (sp?) which was the best!  The orange bang was awesome too.  They had horchata on the soda line but the orange bang was much better.  I wish there were a Tacos El Gordo where I lived.
