This place is BUSY!!!! Smells amazing in there, but I'm super picky about my carne asada. It was way to chewy for me, my husband and I barely picked at the carne asada fries because they meat was soo fatty. Ugh! Grosses me out just typing about it. On the bright side, the adobada (pork) tacos were pretty delicious, so it wasn't a wasted trip.
