As a fat guy, I've gotta love the name!

Stopped by at about 9:30 on a Sunday morning and there was a pretty good crowd.  Thanks to the other Yelp reviews, I kinda/sorta knew what I was doing.

Had the adobado taco and a couple o' lengua tacos with everything.  Very good and reminded me of street tacos in Mexico that I consumed in a former life.

Solid food, and a very friendly staff!  I'll make the trek down Charleston to Tacos El Gordo on my next visit.
