Now best tacos in vegas very bold statement but as of right now best tacos I've had in vegas. Came here cause it was cinco de mayo!!!! and well I love beef and all but where are the fish and chicken tacos man??!! came with the wife and well i had a bad night after that cause she wanted to eat something a little less beef tongue and stomach haha. I love LENGUA if i could eat it everyday i would but the lengua tacos and the asada OMG fucking amazaballs!!!!! the beef shoulder not so much very salty. Service here well think its cause im not hispanic or of any hispanic back ground so the language barrier was def a factor but the set up here is def weird was in one line for asada than they told me to go to another line for asada?! i know each line has separate meats but i was in the right line!!! anyways love the tacos but hate the eating setup outside in vegas when its summer are you kidding??!! yeah i dont think so on the plus side i saw little john there yeah!!! overall this place is good the best so far but i am on the look out for more hidden local spots acutally my local friends told me about this spot so
