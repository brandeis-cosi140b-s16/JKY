Always a staple whenever we're in Vegas. Its perfect for a cheap meal, late night meals, and hangover cures.

I've pretty much only had the tacos and carne asada fries here. I usually never order horchata but here, it's not even an option for me. Yes please!

Walking in, newcomers usually have a problem learning how everything works. You have to stand in different lines for different types of meat. Pork (adobada) line, carne asada line, lengua line etc. After you order and take your food from the lines, then you walk to the cashier to pay. If you're smart, you stand in one line and your friend stands in another line. 

The tacos are a great size and they're about 2 bucks each. I don't care what your preference is here, if it's your first time, you HAVE to try the spicy port Adobada tacos with everything on it!
