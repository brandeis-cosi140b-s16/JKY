I wanted to love this place, I really did. Especially after waiting in line for 40 minutes. I think they just have the lines to convince people to order more when they finally get to the front. When I finally got to the head of the Adobada / Al Pastor line and ordered 4 adobada and 4 Al pastor  just to have the guy tell me they were the same. Now I'm not Mexican but I have eaten alot of Mexican food and I know that Adobada and Al Pastor are not the same thing. At least not at all the other Mexican restaurants I have been to. But he didn't budge so I just ended up with 8 of the same tacos shaved off the spit. Then my buddy who was in the carne asada line said they had not cleaned the grill so all of the meat had burnt black bits all over it. And you could definitely taste it..... the carne asada was not tasty at all. The Adobada was ok but definitely not worth the wait. Oh and did I mention we had to go outside and sit on the curb to eat because the tables were all full.

None of this would have mattered if the tacos had just been great like they were supposed to be. Hell it would have added to the story of the quest for the great taco...... but this ain't the place! Clearly there are drunk people eating here and inflating the reviews.
