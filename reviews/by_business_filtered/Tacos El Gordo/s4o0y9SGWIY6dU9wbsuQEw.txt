Good, it's not perfect. I wish the dining area was not as shabby. Considering it's location on the strip, I expect more. I hate having to stand in separate lines based on what I want to order The food is pretty good and I like sitting outside while dining here. Al pastor was spicy and I will be making regular visits for that alone. Maybe some fries as well. Really good, cheap prices.
