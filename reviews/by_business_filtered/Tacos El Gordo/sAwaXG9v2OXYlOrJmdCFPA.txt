TACOS EL GORDO.  : DEM FAT TACOS

This was one highlight of my vegas trip LOL

I ate at this joint one hour before day 2 of electric daisy carnival..  Stupid idea, but amazing food. 

The breakdown:

40 minutes to get our food in the most hectic line I've ever seen.. 

$10: Campechano fries - Adobada y Carne asada on top of fries topped with cheese & guac. (Spicy pork and Steak)
$2.25 each: 3 Tacos de Lengua. (tongue)
$2.00 each: 3 Tacos de Tripa (Tripe)
$2.00 each: 3 Tacos de Adobada (spicy pork)

Every taco was off the hookk, especially the Campechano fries.  
Also the drinks were awesome, I've never had horchata like that.

If I'm back in vegas, this will be one of my first stops
