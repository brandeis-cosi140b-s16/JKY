Asada (steak), lengua (cow tongue), adobada (spicy pork)...OMG! I don't even know what to say about this place besides "you have to go". It's GOOD!!! The meat is tender and flavorful, all 3 that I tried. The guy that made my tacos put on a little show with flipping the tortillas in the air and catching them. Plus he was cute. :-) And, on the spicy pork tacos, he sliced some pineapple which totally took it up another level. The salsas and sauces are spicy & tasty, and everything is so fresh! Please know, this is a hole in the wall, but aren't those the best after all?
