Everything I said in my previous review still holds true, but we go back here so often and the food is so amazingly delicious that I do not care at all where or how long I have to wait in line to get some! Definitely one of the most authentic food finds in Vegas. Try the adobada (spicy pork), it's our favorite! This place is golden and affordable as well. Five stars all the way.
