Okay so this place is on the run down north end of the strip between the Rivier and the Encore but oh is the food wonderful.  I am a big fan of authentic mexican tacos made from the cuts of meat you do not get everywhere.  The sudero and cabeza tacos were fantastic.  The meat was good even with the little bits of fat.  The campenchana fries were also well worth the money.  You can find fancier americanized mexican food in Las Vegas but this is the real deal.   Tacos run about the $2 a piece and the meat covered fries run about $10 for a large order.   It gets busy in this place but there is a reason for that.  I cannot wait to go back on my next trip.
