Not bad at all for a little taco spot on the strip.  A couple friends recommended this place so we went.  It was easy to find and everything was easy about this place. We walked in and there are menus in front of you before you walk in and when you walk in. 
Here's how you do it. You walk up to the counter, I'd go to the left counter because everyone goes to the first counter they see when they walk in (creates a cluster-f*ck). Once you see the Al Pastor (spicy pork) spinning with that chunk of pineapple on the top and bottom, your mouth should start watering. I ordered 2 carne asada (steak) tacos, hubby ordered 1 carne asada taco and one Al Pastor tostada. They put all the condiments on for you so if you are a condiment nazi (like one of my friends) make sure you ask for it on the side. I wanted it the way it came, with everything on it. As soon as you get your food take it to the cashier, order any drinks you may want, and pay. I couldn't resist the orange and pineapple bang!! As soon as we sat down I scarfed down my tacos like nothing, they were pretty good, Zeke loved the Al Pastor, it's his favorite and he said it was really good. Be sure to ask for napkins from the cashier because that is the only place you'll find them. There are no napkins to grab anywhere else, just from the cashier. Also, if you need to use the restroom you have to ask for the key from the cashier. I stood by the restroom waiting for someone to come out like a geek for a while until an employee told me to get the key. Doh! 
Anyways, if you're looking for some good street tacos to satisfy your late night munchies, to sober up, or cuz you're hungry for some... I'd say come to this place.
