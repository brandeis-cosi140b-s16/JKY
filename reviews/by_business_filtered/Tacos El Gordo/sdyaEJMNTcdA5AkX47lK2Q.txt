The food here is awesome. You can see them making the tortillas right in front of you. I ordered two tacos and a quesadilla. The tacos were on point. Did not disappoint. The quesadilla was ok, but not what I would call a quesadilla. Not a traditional one at least. It was a tortilla with sprinkled cheese, meat on top and a smaller crunchy tortilla on top. To me a quesadilla is a big tortilla with meat and cheese, folded in half. For that, I deducted a star. Customer service was great and so were the prices Only thing I disliked was the lack of available seats. It was so crowded, we had to eat old school style. We placed our trays on the trunk of the car and grubbed.
