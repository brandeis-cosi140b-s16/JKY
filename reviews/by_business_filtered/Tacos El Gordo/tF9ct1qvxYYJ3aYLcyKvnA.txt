200+ people in there, their cafeteria set up ends up becoming one long long line per meat type and theeen you pay at another line.
So I did as many others were doing, ate my tacos before paying, which pissed off the cashier and a couple of the workers so now everyone was happily joined in pissedoffness over their ridiculous set up. Maybe after giving away tacos and giving customers and workers a terrible time, they'll get smart and do business the normal way. The tacos were good of course,(anything is good in a tj style steamed meat greased tortilla) but not worth the hour you'll waste trying to get a couple of different meats.
I suggest driving a little further down to Charleston ave where the other gordo is at, wich is busy, but you'll be eating in ten minutes tops.
