Tacos El Gordo were the best tacos I have ever had in Las Vegas. The prices for their food are reasonable. The staff is very friendly. There were no long lines and there was plenty of seating either indoors or outdoors. My favorite tacos were the Spicy Adobada. My sisters and I went to go eat there two days in a row. It hits the spot after a night of drinking. I will be eating here every time I am in Las Vegas.
