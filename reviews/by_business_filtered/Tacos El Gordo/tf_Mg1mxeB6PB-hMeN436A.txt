Definitely not worth the wait, I'm not sure if anyone writing reviews has ever had a truly great taco before. There was nothing special about the meat, tortillas, or salsa. We tried the asada and pork, both were not even average. Go to any taco truck in LA and it will be faster and better than this joint! Highly disappointed and would never recommend.
