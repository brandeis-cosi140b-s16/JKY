I am hooked on the Vampiros. They are made by frying the small corn tortillas with cheese then filled to order. The pork adobada is out of this world and are sliced to order. I order them with everything on them, and they drip and drop while you eat them and they are oh so good! I have also ordered the regular taco but the Vampiro you don't see everywhere.

I have read reviews of people complaining of the price, $4 for the Vampiro and $2 for the others is a great deal considering it is Las Vegas and I am willing to pay the price to sit down and eat in an air conditioned building or be inside when it is cold. 

The location is in an industrial area so do not expect anything fancy, and they are beginning to add photos on the wall and the building has been recently painted. It can get very busy, so do not go during rush periods if you expect "fast" food.
