The Good: Best Taco's I ever had, but I did come here really hungry after clubbing on a Saturday night.  It's really good though and I live in Los Angeles. I didn't really know what I was ordering (Tacos Carne Asada) Doesn't matter... what ever you get,  you'll love it .

The Bad: I'm Filipino so  didn't mind the ambiance or the scene there that night. But, if your not a minority ...you might feel out of place, but that's really up to you.
