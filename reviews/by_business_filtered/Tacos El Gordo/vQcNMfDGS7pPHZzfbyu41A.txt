Great Food! Very Generous on the meats. Never fails, tacos are really good and filling. Mulitas look delicious didn't actually have one but one of my friends did and he absolutely loved it. Sopes taste really good the "maza" used to make the sope is very flavorful. Had the Campechana fries and honestly i would stay away from the asada,  i would say their specialty is adobada/ pastor, asada had a very overpowering smoky taste. Adobada is the way to go.  Location is off the strip, which is not a good thing but worth the drive! You wont regret it. Inexpensive.
