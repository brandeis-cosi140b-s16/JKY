Yes! Yes! Yes! Being from San Diego and spending a lot of time in Mexico, I can say this place is it! The style of the place is perfect, simple and humble. They people behind the counter are hard working and know what they're doing. They are all incredible! I don't understand why I can't find anything like this in Colorado! I'm drooling right now just thinking about those awesome little street tacos. YUM!
