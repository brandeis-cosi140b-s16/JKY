A notch lower than the one in Chula Vista definitely, because the pork goes on the grill for a little bit before reaching your taco, rather than cutting it right off the rotating roaster and dropping into the taco.

in order from best to good

1 - Spicy Pork Tacos
2 - Lengua Tacos
3 - Shoulder Tacos

quite honestly I would recommend getting 4 spicy pork tacos and 2 lengua tacos for yourself.  ask your friend to simultaneously line up for a different ingredient so you don't have waste time standing around
