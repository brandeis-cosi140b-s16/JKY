The set-up makes better sense after it's explained to you.  The lines are different because of the types of meat they serve.  Everything pork to the left, beef in the middle, and everything else on the right.  I can see how things would get chaotic if you want different items though.  

Luckily, we came in during off-peak time, 3 in the afternoon, and were able to try the spicy pork, and a few others.  I liked the sopes the best because of the gooey layer of cheese.  Yum!

Some of the meats weren't as flavourful as I had hoped so we slathered on some spicy salsa which still wasn't all that spicy.  Go figure.  All in all, it was a pretty good snack and for the price, worth the trek.  

That pineapple-coconut drink was so good!  Pi√±a Colada.  Double yum!

3.5 stars, but rounding up to 4.  The service was so friendly and helpful.
