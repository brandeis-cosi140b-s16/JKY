Was in town for a week for business. Had a very large per diem and out of all the meals I had that week this was by far the best meal I had. Got 3 tacos adobada and an horchata for $6 and by far the best meal I had this whole trip. Definitely get some local food in ya and check this spot out even if you are the only white guy in the establishment.
