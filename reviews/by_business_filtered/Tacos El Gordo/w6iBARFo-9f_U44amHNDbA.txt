Street tacos, fast, dirty (in a good way!), and flavorful.  Most people get nostalgic with their mom's spaghetti, fried chicken, or whatever.

Not me.  Throw me a plate of tacos de buche, extra crispy tripas, and maybe some sesos if I'm feeling dangerous and I'm blasted back into the past as 11 year old me on an LA street corner taco shop munching away on organ meats.

Would've been 5 stars if i was still recovering from the night before and if they tacos were $0.50 cheaper.

Bottom line: fast, authentic, TJ style tacos at American prices.  Get away from the buffets and get down on some buche.
