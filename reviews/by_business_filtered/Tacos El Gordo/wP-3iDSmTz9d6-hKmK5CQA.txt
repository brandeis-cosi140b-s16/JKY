My husband and I came hereon the first night here in Las Vegas from San Diego! The service was amazing, the food was delicious and the customer service was great!

We ordered Campechana fries and two adobada tacos and our bill was $9.79! 

The fries were loaded with cheese, guacamole and sour cream! My husband and I even asked the cook for extra onions and salsa! We loved the fact that he was really nice and didn't give us any negative feedback because of our requests! His name is Mauro and we loved him (: we definitely come here again! 

Excellent food and excellent service
