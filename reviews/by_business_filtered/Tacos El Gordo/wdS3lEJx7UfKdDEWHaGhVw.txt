My wife and I come here every year on our anniversary and stand in line for sometimes 40 minutes.  And that's at 1AM.  Very good, traditional tacos.  They are as good as any street taco I have had in Mexico.

There are only two downsides here:

1:  The wait can be very long

2:  There is very little seating for the size crowds that form at both doors so plan accordingly.
