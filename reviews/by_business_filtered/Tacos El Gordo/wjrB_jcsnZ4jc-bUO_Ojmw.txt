I personally, am happy they moved to the middle of nowhere, because now I don't have to deal with the craziness of the strip in order to get delicious tacos!

I lived in San Diego, where legit Mexican food exists. After moving to Vegas, I needed to find my go-to taco shop. Tacos El Gordo is hands down one of the best tacos I've ever had! Yes, they're a bit pricey for tacos, but they are bomb so it's all good.

Adobada tacos are amazing, the meat is so tasty and the toppings (guac mayo!) combined just make it heaven in my mouth. I usually order three, but I can probably two more if I want to be a fatty. Campechana fries are also a must- half adobada/half carne asada. *Drools*

Only thing is that they are stingy with the salsa. They keep it in a fridge behind the cashier, and you'll go over there with all your tacos and full order of fries and they'll give you one measly cup. I'm usually like, "Can I have 3 more?" and they're good about it.
