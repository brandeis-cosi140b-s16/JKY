It's easy to fall in love with Tacos El Gordo... the smell of grilled carne asada as you walk from the parking lot to the door, the hole-in-the-wall atmosphere, the amazing tacos... Yeah, I've fallen for this place just like many others have. Even though part of my heart still belongs to my first (taco) love, Los Parados. But, that place is long gone and I'm just glad I finally have El Gordo to fill the void.

The adobada tacos ($2 ea.) are every bit as good as everyone says they are. The best part of the pork were the pieces carved from the exterior of the pork on a spit. They had an amazing crispy, charred edge to it that added to the transcendent flavor and texture combinations of the tacos.

And, don't forget about the carne asada tacos ($2 ea.). They're some of the best I've had in town. The quality of the beef was outstanding. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the slimy green faux-guac sauce covering the meat. Next time I'll just have to get the tacos plain, with nothing but onions and cilantro.

Everyone seems to love this place, as evidenced by the long lines that snaked through the restaurant during the peak lunch time. So, whether or not you love tacos or are a taco virgin, stop by Tacos El Gordo and you'll be enthralled too.
