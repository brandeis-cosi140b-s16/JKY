In my experiance the Las Vegas strip and inexpensive street food has never gone hand in hand. That's was  until my hotel recommended Tacos El Gordo. Tacos El Gordo is located on the no so nice end of the strip, near Circus Circus and the Riviera. Don't expect anything that you might typical find at your average sit down Mexican restaurant. Here you'll find street food, tacos, tostadas, etc. Couple that with a very nice covered outdoor seating area and somewhat limited indoor seating giving you the best of both worlds, street food with a place to sit down and eat. Here will find a very basic menu of inexpensive fare.

I can highly recommend the spicy pork and steak tacos, the pork being something special which is sliced off a rotating spit as you order. Tacos while small come over stuffed and sloppy with meat, cilantro, onions, guacamole and sour cream. For sure nothing comes out of a can. If you feel adventurous among other things you have a choice of tripe or beef brain tacos. Just keep in mind the menu is very basic, all items in Spanish with most having English translation. Taco's run $2 each. 

Service is very friendly and helpful if you have a question. Lines can be long, but move quickly. Here you'll find locals, not tourists. Long lines of locals are always a good sign, and it holds true here. The place is very clean.

Bottom line, Tacos El Gordo is the perfect spot for lunch or late night after boozing in a local casino, open until 3:00AM. One of my go to stops in Vegas. These dudes bang out seriously good chow!
