While at work in the casino some random hotel guest walked up to me and asked me if I knew what time Tacos El Gordo opens in the morning.. I guess I just look like the kinda gal who would know. And who loves Mexican food with all her heart. 

Anyway two words: ADOBADA. FRIES.

If I could eat these every day for the rest of my life and not get fat(..ter) I DEFINITELY WOULD.

They freshly shave the grilled spicy pork off of the rotating stack and sprinkle it onto perfectly crispy french fries topped with fresh FRESH guacamole, cheese, and sour cream. Equally delicious whether sober or highly intoxicated. The small size is more than enough for one person. 

Oh and they close at 3 AM and will not let you in after that time. :( make sure you get there before then so you don't have to resort to Denny's.
