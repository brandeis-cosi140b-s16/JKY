I don't understand why there's three seperate lines for different meat? What if I wanted 3 tacos with different meat on them? Anyway, this place was an old gas station  before? So down to the nitty gritty! I ordered 3 adobada tacos with pineapple on top, with everything. And adobada fries! The adoboda fries were soooooo BOMB! Hands down best I ever had!!
