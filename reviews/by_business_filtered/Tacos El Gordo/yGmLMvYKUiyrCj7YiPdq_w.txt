Best Mexican food ever. It's always so crowded here, but it's always worth the wait and you can see why it's so crowded here when you taste their food.

I come from the other side of Vegas, but I really do not mind the drive. They're open late too, for any late meals or snacking.

My go to here is adobada everything. The adobada fries are amazing and the adobada tacos are even better. The staff always seems so happy too, it's just a great experience every time :)
