This place is by far the best for tacos! It is also open during the wee hours of the morning. Whenever a friend comes to visit I take them here. This place has amazing carne asana tacos and does not lack on quality and the spices are very flavorful. The horchata fountain drink was also amazing. Some restaurants will "water down" this drink and the taste gives this away. However this place has unmatchable BOLD flavor in their drinks and tacos with reasonable pricing.
