Had the pleasure of trying Tacos El Gordo and it was definitely worth the wait you have to endure if ordering lengua, buche or tripa. 

The lengua was one of the better ones I have ever had. Soft, tender and tasteful so it  was well worth the wait. The grilled onions, radishes made a perfect combo with the lengua.

The tripa, which I had not had in a while, was perfect. It was crispy, chewy and just enough salt to being it all together. 

Having to wait for service isn't terrible because it is a small place and what looks like a popular destination. Definitely a place to try if Mexican is desired.
