Whoa!  I can't believe it took me so long to finally discover this gem.  I never thought anything on the strip could be authentic.  But this place really takes you back to Tijuana.  The al pastor they call spicy pork.  Make sure you ask the server for a slice of the pi√±a.  That's my fav taco by far.  I'm still undecided if I want to try the cow brain taco next time.
