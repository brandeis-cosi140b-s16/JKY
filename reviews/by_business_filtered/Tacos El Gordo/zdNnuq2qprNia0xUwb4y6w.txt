Hands down the best tacos I've eaten, aside from the other Tacos El Gordo in San Diego.  I was so happy to discover that this place was walking distance from where I was staying.  There was a long line, but we knew it was going to be so. worth. it. 

Upon reaching the entrance, you'll find that there are three lines inside for different tacos.  
     1. Carne Asada and Chorizo 
     2. Adobada
     3. All the other stuff
This can get kind of problematic if you want a few tacos from each of the lines, but I'm guessing that this was the most efficient way to move things along.  Try to get your friends in the other lines to order the tacos for you!

I tried the Lengua ($2.25), Tripa ($2.00), and Adobada ($2.00) tacos.  The lengua taco (aka tongue for you gringos) was SO tender and juicy.  Tripa (tripe) was kind of a  weird texture for me.  I don't think that crunchy goes well in tacos, but some might say otherwise! Adobada was my personal favorite.  That green sauce they put on it is delicious.  

If you want the best cheap eats on the strip, I don't think you have to look much further than Tacos El Gordo.
