I am from the Bay, so I have had some of the greatest mexican, more importantly, street tacos ever..... And tacos Jalisco kills it! Everything on the menu is what's up! 

I usually get the 3 taco plate: uno carnitas, dos al pastor. They have bomb burritos too! The meat is succulent and spiced perfectly! 

I love how the location is a hole in the wall next to a dive called the the last call.

By far the best mexican food in the valley!... Sad to see the location on Osborn and Scottsdale go :( 

Vive la taco Jalisco!
