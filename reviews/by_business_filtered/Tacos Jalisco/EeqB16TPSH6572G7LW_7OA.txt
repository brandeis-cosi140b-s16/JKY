This place is awesome! If you read a bad review, especially about the one across the street from a Taco, you are talking & reading about the wrong place.  This Tacos Jalisco (the real one) is on 68th Street, not on Thomas.  The location on Thomas is their original location which they sold, and in the contract had to allow them the right to use the name.  The food is not even close!! So make sure you check out the correct location on 68th.  You will be happy that you did.  The "free" pickled veggie bar is awesome, be sure to grab some of it in a baggie on your way it to accompany your meal. Another great one is the pace across the street next door to TD Road house.  Their Carne Asada is unreal, or the chicken that they grill outside over coal.  a Whole chicken, pint of rice, pint of beans, pint of home made salsa, like 10-12 corn tortillas, $10!
