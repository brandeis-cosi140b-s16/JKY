I've kind of stopped ordering other things from the menu after I discovered that their bean and cheese burritos with the reddish-brown salsa are among the very best things that life has to offer.  If I were to commit suicide, I'd lock myself in a room with hundreds of those burritos and a warped record playing somewhere softly.  Everyone would find me days later, dead as shit, with a big smile on my face.
