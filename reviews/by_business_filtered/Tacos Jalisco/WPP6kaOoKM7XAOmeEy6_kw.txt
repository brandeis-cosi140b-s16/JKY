My boyfriend and I have been here twice now and we love it! Both of us are very picky about our tacos and I love carne asada in a dangerous way, this place is amazing! The meat has wonderful texture and flavor!! The guys here definitrly know how to work the grill. I want to try something different but I just love the carne too much! Maybe someday lol.
