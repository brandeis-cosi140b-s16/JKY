This is a fantastic place. It's bigger inside than it looks from the outside, because it's located in a tiny strip mall with a Circle K and a tiny tavern.

This is the only what one would consider authentic Mexican restaurant that I've found that actually puts rice AND beans in their delicious burritos automatically. Their breakfast burritos are outstanding. Parking is a little tight, as this joint is popular!
