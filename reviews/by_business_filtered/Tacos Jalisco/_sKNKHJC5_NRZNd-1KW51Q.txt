Don't be afraid of the parking lot and appearance! Tacos Jalisco is delicious, authentic Mexican food. It's clean inside and the staff is nice. 

I ordered a cheese quesadilla and carne asada taco combo. It came with a side of beans and a tiny salad. It was cooked to order - you can see into the kitchen so you know it's fresh. They have a salsa bar with limes, grilled peppers, and three or four types of homemade salsa.

I was very hungry when I ordered and the combo meal was just large enough to leave me stuffed! Anything extra would have been too much food. :) 

I ordered a horchata and it was delicious! The vanilla and cinnamon flavors blended smoothly. I love horchata so I'm happy it was great! I plan to will get horchata every time I go!
