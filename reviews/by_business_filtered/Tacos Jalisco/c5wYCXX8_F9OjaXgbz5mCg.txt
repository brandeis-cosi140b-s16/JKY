Some people might be picky about what "authentic" Mexican food should be but this place covers all the bases for me.  Nice kind Mexican staff, amazing meat choices for tacos, imported sodas and amazing sauces and salsas.  I had the 3 taco plate ( lengua, tripas and carne) and I haven't felt that satisfied after only 3 tacos in how long.  Great prices too not to mention, I'll be back soon!
