I was pleasantly surprised to find this place! Stumbled upon them on Yelp when another taco place I was craving wasn't open. The menu is plastered all over the wall so you will immediately notice the fair price points for all their dishes. I ordered street tacos and a quesadilla.  Both were phenomenal, the rice and beans are also top quality. 

As I was walking away with my to-go order, the chef yelled after me to let me know that he had put sour cream on my tacos, "Was that okay, or do you want me to re-make them"? You just don't get service like that everywhere. 

Great Job Taco Jalisco, You are looking like my new GO-TO taco spot.  

***Easter Egg*** 
The Carne Asada street tacos come loaded with meat and not one, but 2 tortillas stacked together. It's like getting 2 for the price of 1
