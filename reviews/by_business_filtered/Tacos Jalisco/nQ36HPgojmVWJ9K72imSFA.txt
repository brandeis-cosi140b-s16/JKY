I fought back and forth between a 5 and a 4. To be honest, the only reason I didnt give a 5 is because its my first time and I leave 5s for consistency. Taste though? Yeah, thats a 5. Carne asada burrito is bursting with flavor. I added cheese, only flaw with the burrito is that cheese wasnt fully melted. Other than that, delicious. Throw it in the microwave for 30 seconds, its fine. But the meat is definitely juicy compared to a lot of places in this area. I'll be back again, fairly soon. Only spent 8 bucks and thats cause I wanted a mexican coke(half liter) for 2 bucks. Thats pretty cheap in my book.
