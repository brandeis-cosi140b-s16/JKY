In a word...  Deliciosos! 

Good food....  Probably will not do an order of chips with salsa next time...  For $3 it was nothing special at all.  But the rest was tasty.  The service was prompt, but none too friendly.  When you consider that we weren't there to make friends, we came to enjoy Mexican food...  We still won.  :-)
