Yelp comes through again.  Tacos Jalisco is SOOO good.  I was skeptical of the Styrofoam trays, and not sure if the lady taking my order understood what I was ordering (I had to repeat myself a few times), but what came from the kitchen was exactly what I wanted on my trip to Phoenix.  

Carne Asada came highly recommended, as did the quesadilla, so we followed suit and were so pleased  Carne Asada is so well seasoned and chopped, with a just that little  bit of char that you really look for. I could have used more tortillas, but I made do.  The quesadilla came with a a little carne asada taco on top, and was enormous.  It was not the typical one big flour tortilla folded in half, and grilled, there was much more thought put into this than I really expected.  How much thought can you give to a tortilla and cheese?  Apparently more than I had considered.   Plus, it came with a little carne asada taco on the side, which was an unexpected bonus.  It came with guacamole (don't order a side of guac unless, you really need a quart), beans and rice. the beans were good and the rice was fantastic.  

Ambiance, was pretty basic, table wobbled, chairs were simple, and Spanish language music videos were playing on the TV, but that kind of added to the charm.

I'm from the north (and not Latino), so I don't have a lot of quality Mexican food to compare it to, but it shall now be the mark by which all other Mexican food shall be measured.
