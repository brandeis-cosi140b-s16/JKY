For a hole-in-the-wall taco shop, the #6 combo of 3 carne asada tacos with rice and beans was decent. Previous reviewers are correct in that the salsas are all absolutely delicious, especially the verde. The carne in the tacos is not very good quality, and tasted about a half step up from ground beef to me. I think why people like it is because it was very fatty meat. The beans were awful-- very little taste at all and soupy consistency. The rice was just as bad. I drowned both these sides in salsa just to make them edible. Great that you can enjoy with a Mexican Coke (no beer though). Parking's a bitch but made up for it with the ability to dine watching telenovelas.
