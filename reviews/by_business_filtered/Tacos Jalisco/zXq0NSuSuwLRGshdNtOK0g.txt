I came here on the New Times recommendation while on a recent business trip, and ye gods it was absolutely worth it.

This may just have been the best Mexican food I've ever had.

I was kicking myself for only ordering a burrito/taco combo and not something more adventurous, but the chicken (burrito) and carnitas (taco) were the stuff my dreams are made of.

You are doing yourself a disservice by reading this review and not driving over there right now to order something. Do it.
