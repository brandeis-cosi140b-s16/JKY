Ugg!! I hate to do this but I have to. Sitting there, enjoying my second trip here and second plate of tacos I saw the unthinkable. A live cockroach cruising on the floor. I thought to myself, ok, it's possible, it may just be a fluke. I decided to finish my taco with a grossed out feeling. As my girlfriend was wrapping up her meal, she says "look babe; there's a cockroach." This roach was a different roach in obviously in a different location. 

I hate to leave a sour review on good food but I cannot help it. I can only imagine when this place closes at night and the lights are off, how many more are grazing the pastures. I won't be back and someone may need to check into this place in regards to rodents and insects. GROSS!
