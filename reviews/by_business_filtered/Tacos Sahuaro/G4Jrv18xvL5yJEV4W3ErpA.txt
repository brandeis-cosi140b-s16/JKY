Oh man! Decided to "take-out" with the mister on a whim tonight and we are SO glad we did. Talk about a money street taco... We tried the Pollo, Asada, Al Pastor and Chorizo. I probably wouldn't get the chorizo again because there's just something about it for me that feels more 'breakfasty' but it was still great. The salsas were spicy without being overwhelming and I loved the crispy, grilled soft tacos. Not much to look at inside but we will definitely be back for the food. At $2/Taco I would've been fine eating just 2 and 3 1/2 put me over the edge! Definitely recommend it!
