Loved it! This place is very authentic, humble, and most important: DELICIOUS!!!! Looks can be deceiving, please don't get scared of the simple looks and may I even say "ghetto" vibe & looks... This place serves a great portion of food, very clean food and staff.  Oh, staff is very polite, very attentive.  Def will be going back for more:)
