My husband and I were staying in Arizona for only a day and had a craving for Mexican food. Looked up restaurants near by and came across this whole in the wall. As we walked into the restaurant we were dubious to order but we've always known that hole in the walls tend to have the best food and this joint was no exception. I ordered the asada gordita and my husband the chorizo and asada tostada with a side of the mini chorizo quesadilla. Hands down this has been the best Mexican food we have eaten and even being from LA. The food was fresh made to order and did not taste of grease like other Mexican foods. Another upside was their affordable prices. The only downside is their small menu selection, but their tasty quality food makes up for it. If you are in town please give this modest hole in the wall a try! You will honestly not regret it!
