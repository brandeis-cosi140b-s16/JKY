Legit quality tacos.  $2/taco is very reasonable for the size, accompanying garnishes, & high level of service they provide.  

Definitely recommend the al pastor & carne asada tacos.  
Authentic mexican tacos with light crisp on the tortillas & freshly made salsas.

Also they have a fresh from scratch made Horchata for the many folks that love that drink.
