This place has EXCELLENT street tacos. The Carne Asada taco is one of the best I have had perfectly seasoned, grilled and perectly tender. 

FYI- for anyone who hasn't gone yet- when you are looking out for the restaurant the first time you go, make sure you look for Tacos Saguaro (that is what the sign says- for some reason Yelp has the name spelled wrong.)
