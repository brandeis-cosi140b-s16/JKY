The first time I went to Tacos Sahuaro I was thinking about the tacos I ate the rest of the day and I had to go back the next day.  I've been going every week since.  The corn tortillas are the best I've ever had. 

They must use black magic to make the tortillas or maybe they fry them in crack.  Whatever it is I don't care there is no better tortilla on the planet. If you come here, and you would be crazy not to, make sure whatever you get has a corn tortilla you won't be disappointed.

The menu is tiny but they will basically make you whatever you ask for.  I always ask for vegetarian tacos (beans, lettuce, tomato, cheese and cilantro).  $2 per taco it doesn't get any better than that. Plus they give you cucumbers, limes, pickled carrots, onions and jalapenos with each order.

p.s. ask for the spicy salsa its pretty spicy but has great depth of flavor.
