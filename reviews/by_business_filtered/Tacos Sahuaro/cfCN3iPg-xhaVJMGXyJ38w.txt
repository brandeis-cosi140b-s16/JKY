This is seriously very authentic Mexican food! Me and my boyfriend are regulars and usually order carne asada tacos, chorizo tacos, sopes, quesadillas, tostadas, or burritos. Those are all super duper good! The salsas are spicy and tasty, just like they're supposed to be! Don't be fooled by the sketchy outer appearance of the building, you will not be disappointed!
