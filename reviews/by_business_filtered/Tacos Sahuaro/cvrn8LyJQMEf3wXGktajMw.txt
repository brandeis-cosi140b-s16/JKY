In search of Tacos de tripas I was guided to Tacos Sahuayo by Yelp. This is not the best looking place but its comfortable the people are nice. The Tacos are even better. I had one of each, un taco de lengua, uno al pastor, uno de cabeza y uno de tripas. They are big and are served on two tortillas along with a bowl with limes, cucumber and radishes. They were delicious!!! Its hard to find a good place that has Tacos de tripas and this is one you must try. (Cash only)
