Real Mexican food.  REAL.  I ordered en Espanol.  

Street style tacos:  Handmade tortillas, deliciously seasoned meats (listed below), onions, cilantro, lemons, salsas, radishes and pickled jalapenos on the side.

Gordita:  Like a tostada sandwich full of meat, lettuce, sauce, cilanto, onions

Burritos:  Any meat choice including Lengua, Cabeza, Tripas, Carne Asada, and more.

The real deal!

Amazing complex flavors.

Atmosphere is down-home, clean, but looks dirty because it is in a rundown strip mall.  It is a sit down after you order from the counter type place.  Be forewarned, its run down, and not in a charming way.  Totally worth it for the food though.

Not fast food.  It always takes them quite awhile to prepare everything, and it shows in the results.
