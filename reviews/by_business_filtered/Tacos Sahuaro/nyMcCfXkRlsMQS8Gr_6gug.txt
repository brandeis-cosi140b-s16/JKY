Last dinner in town before heading back to Seattle and we were looking for a place that was quick and nearby.  This is the place!

They have tortas, tacos, burritos, quesadillas and so on.

I had their chorizo taco and carne asada quesadilla and they were seasoned well and done perfectly.  Especially, the carne asada, it was moist, flavorful, all-around good with a little kick.  My wife had their burrito and taco in head and lengua meat and she liked hers.

I also had a Mexican bottle Coke which is always refreshing and good.  My wife's sangria out of the bottle drink was not good; we thought they made their own sangria.

If only Seattle had good Mexican food. (sighs)
