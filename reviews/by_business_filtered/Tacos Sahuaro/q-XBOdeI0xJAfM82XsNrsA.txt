It was a Saturday and I also learned that it was National Taco Day, so I thought I'd come here after reading the reviews. I came way after the lunch hour to make sure that there would be a place to park, as I had seen in a Google map street view that parking in front of the eatery is extremely limited. The interior of the place is clean and very basic, with two big-screen TVs on each end of the dining area showing some variety shows. I ordered asada, lengua, carnitas, and pastor tacos and a glass of horchata to wash it all down. The tacos were mostly OK, though one of them had a "reheated meat" taste. The cool cucumber slices and pickled carrots on the side were a nice touch. The horchata was pretty standard but refreshing. As is typical of most street taco places, the food was very inexpensive. I do not regret coming here but I would prefer to go to other street taco places next time the taco craving hits.
