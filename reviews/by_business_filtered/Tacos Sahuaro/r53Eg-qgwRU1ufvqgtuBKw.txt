Oh yeah Carne Asada tacos are fantastic - 3 tacos at $2 each is insanely low and they are large street tacos and the burrito is a meal and a half - pineapple juice is a pleasant refreshing surprise - service is excellent and it's warm inside so sit in front of one of the portable little ac units and no sports on TV it's Mexican TV best 2-3 tacos in the valley
