I am not at all certain that I could have been more disappointed. I was hoping for a challenger to my very favorite Tacos (Asadero del Norte Sonora) but alas, it was not to be.

Cute, tidy place where at 6 PM on a weeknight, I was the only Customer.

Of the three Tacos I ordered, only one (Carne Asada) was edible and it was good. The other two (Pastor and Chicarrone) had absolutely no taste whosoever and the texture left a great deal to be desired.

Will NOT repeat for another try, too many other alternatives.
