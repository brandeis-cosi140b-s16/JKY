First thought is where do I park?! I parked out front then realized they had parking out back as well so I pulled around into the alley and parked in the back, came in through the back door. Place was empty, ugly. But very pleasantly surprising. My order was taken by a very nice lady that spoke English and Spanish! I read all the great reviews on the tacos so I had to try some. Got 3 asada tacos and 3 pork tacos. Came out very hot! Aye the pork first, lots of good flavor in there. They give you all kinds of fixins for your tacos! Pork was very good. Then the asada tacos. They were ok, kind of bland so you need to flavor it up with everything. Still everything was very good, you can tell they have good quality meat and products. I will come back.
