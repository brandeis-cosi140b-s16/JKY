My husband and I were in Madison from out of town, and this place reportedly had good Mexican food. I am not a snooty restaurant goer in the least, but I was initially off-put by how dirty the kitchen and dining area were. Not enough to make me leave, but enough to leave a bad first impression. The restaurant is also very crowded and uncomfortable to sit in. The food was good and authentic, but I've had better in cleaner environments.
