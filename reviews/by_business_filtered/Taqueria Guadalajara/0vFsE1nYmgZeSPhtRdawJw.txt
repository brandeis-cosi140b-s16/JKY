This place is five stars for food but the service is lacking. Food is the best in Madison. The chips and salsa possibly the best I've ever had. The only problem is they give you a really small basket and you have to ask a few times for a refill of the chips but be sure to always ask for salsa because getting them to refill that is also a chore. Everything I've had is delicious not a bad item on the menu. The taco dinner only comes with two but they are hearty and filling even if you're use to getting three.
