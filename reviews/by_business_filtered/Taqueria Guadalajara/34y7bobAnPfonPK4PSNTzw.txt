My favorite a la carte Mexican restaurant in Madison is back, with a fresh new coat of paint and the same familiar vibe. My favorite dish went up in price and was renamed to Platillo Guadalajara, but it's still the same fatty thin-sliced steak with crispy ends goodness. I like to eat half the plate with corn tortillas and pack the rest away for tomorrow's lunch. 

It can be fun to watch the kitchen bustle at the counter seats, but you'll definitely leave smelling like tortillas and onions. The spacious room in the back is usually filled with couples and families during lunch on the weekends. Taqueria Guadalajara is on its way to becoming a Madisonian institution.
