Don't let the pink siding and the decor inside scare you away.  The food here is in my top 3 in Madison.  Basically working off of a flat top and deep fryer, the small kitchen puts out solid and delicious (and very affordable) eats.  Their tacos are great.  Classic two corn tortillas wrapped around a meat, cilantro, and onions.  They bring out two different types of salsa for you to choose from.  Make sure you try either the sopes (ingredients on top) or the gordita (ingredients stuffed inside).  Both are made using a thicker tortilla that puffs up when fried. They are out of this world and for around $2.50 each, they are a bargain.

Note:  If you decide to sit in the front of the restaurant, be prepared to carry the smells of the kitchen with you the rest of the day.  To me, a small price to pay to eat excellent fare!
