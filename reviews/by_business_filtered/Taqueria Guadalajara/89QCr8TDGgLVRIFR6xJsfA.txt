Love the beer choices. Too bad there aren't margaritas. Staff are great, attentive enough to have your needs met. Quick enough for work lunch! Chips and salsa replenished a few times.

The place is small and cozy, windows along the back wall. I like the bright walls and flatware.

The food was excellent - rice, beans, burrito, tacos, steak, fried jalapeno, chips, two types of salsa, Modelos. I'll be back for sure; there are many more items on the menu I hope to try.
