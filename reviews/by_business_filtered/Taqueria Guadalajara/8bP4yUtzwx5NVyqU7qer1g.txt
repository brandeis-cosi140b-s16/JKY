Divey goodness at its best! This is a tiny family-run restaurant serving really good, authentic Mexican food. My Mexican husband and I checked this place out recently after a few recommendations from friends in Madison. We were both really impressed (which is really hard to do - especially my husband) with everything.  

I had a carne asada huarache - which was a large plate of excellent carne asada, lettuce, onion, cilantro, avocado and cheese atop a thick, bready tortilla (sort of like a pita). F was excited that they had tacos de tripa (I won't explain) but he also got asada and one al pastor. It was all great.

Excellent prices - great, authentic tacos, friendly operators - go here!
