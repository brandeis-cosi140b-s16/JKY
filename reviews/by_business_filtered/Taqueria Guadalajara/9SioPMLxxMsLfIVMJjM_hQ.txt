I stopped in for breakfast before the Great Taste. I was trying to find a Mexican part of town, and just happened to see the pink house looking building.  I could not have done better. 
 This is real Mexican food. A small joint, devoid of gimmicks and frills. The staff was super friendly, and there was a soccer game on tv. You know you have found a decent place to eat when they lead you through the (tiny, but clean) kitchen to your table. 
 I had a steak huarache and a lengua taco, and they were deliciously devoid of the massive piles of melted cheese some places use to hide the fact that their food sucks. 
 This is the good stuff. Fresh and bright flavors for a great price. I will make a point to stop here anytime I am in the area.
