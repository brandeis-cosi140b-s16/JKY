I'm ok with this place. I've actually only gone here a couple times after the rebuild after the fire damage. The food is quite good ranging from average to above average. It's light years ahead of some of the guck I had earlier from Fuzzy's Taco Shop yet I can't say I'd drive here over similar neighborhood tastes like El Pastor or La Hacienda. The reason this place won't get stars higher with me is honestly trhe seating and noise. It feels like I'm in some kind of lunch room in High School all over again when there are more people there. Everyone seems friendly and the servers are friendly but its strange for me to have a meal with people at my elbows that I don't know. The other issue I've come across there is cleanliness ranging from strange things floating in the water to finding a rubber band in the salsa.. It looked like something to just tie jalapenos or tomatos-not a hair band..but still.. I'm sure curiosity will drive me back here again in the future or will venture into a delivery option sometime again.
