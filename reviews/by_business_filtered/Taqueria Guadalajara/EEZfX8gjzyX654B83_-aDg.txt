I am basing this on one visit and usually like to visit multiple times before reviewing, but I'll give it a shot. When I go again, I'll update. I would probably have given it three stars, but I'd heard so many good things and I was disappointed, and I also always like to promote what I call Madison's triumvirate of awesome if lesser known Mexican places: Taqueria Guanajuato, La Hacienda, and Antojitos El Toril (technically in Monona, but that town is ours too :) ).

So all I got here were three gorditas containing three different meats. I haven't much more than this to say: all three of them were very standard, nothing that stood out positively in either the meats or the toppings stuffed in, and the ultra greasiness, like to the point of nigh-on immediate heartburn, stood out negatively.

I do understand that good and/or authentic Mexican is greasy, but not like this.
