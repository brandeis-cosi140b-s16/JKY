It's a hole in the wall, but in my opinion, great food comes from hole in the walls.  After all, I want the place that can sustain a business just from the food alone and not because it's a nice and pleasant place to sit and chat.  

I'm not sure why people say that it's not the cleanest place to eat.  I didn't see any health department ratings, but the place seemed clean enough.  And after a quick scan of the other reviews on this site, it doesn't seem like anybody's gotten sick or anything either.  I suspect it's just more of the usual Madison liberal snobbery because of the cosmetics of the place.  

It's not the best Mexican food I've had.  I'd like their carne asada to be a little bit more marinated.  I had two carne asada tacos and one al pastor.  They were generous wiht the cilantro which is a definite plus.  I'd love a salsa verde option, but I'll take what I can get.  I didn't particularly enjoy the burrito as it felt a bit soggy.  But despite this, it's the best Mexican in Madison.  It'll certainly satisfy my cravings until I can get back to California or actually make the effort to make my own.  

 There isn't really enough seating for big groups here, but take out is always an option.
