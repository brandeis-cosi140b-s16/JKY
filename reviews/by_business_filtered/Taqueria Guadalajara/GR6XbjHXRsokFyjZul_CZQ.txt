Best. Mexican. Food. In. Madison. Always good.  Always full of people. Recently opened a new seating area that doubles their capacity.  I you check the wall, you will see tha this tiny hole in the wall was suggested by a national newspaper as one of the best places in the nation for Mexican fare.  It is delicious, it is quick, it is very inexpensive.
