I used to live practically across the street from this place, and finally went one balmy summer night.  It's really good food, and great service - especially at such reasonable prices!

It really is a hole in the wall.  There are a couple of tables jammed in with a lunch counter, so it's definitely a place for small groups.  There is also a porch for a few extra tables in the back, which is great for warm summer nights.  If you're sitting at the counter, you can watch the cook prepare your meal right in front of you.
