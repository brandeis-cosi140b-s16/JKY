If you want to eat REAL Mexican food, visit Taqueria Guadalajara. It's a tiny space with an open kitchen. Sit at the front counter if you can, so you can enjoy the full cultural experience. 

We've visited several times, but I'll focus on my most recent visit. It was Saturday lunch. We arrived just prior to 11:30, after having been to indoor cycling class earlier that morning, so we were starving for an early lunch. Good thing we arrived when we did, as the place was completely packed 10 minutes after we arrived.

I ordered the huarache el Paisano, which is refried beans, a piece of grilled cactus, fried onions, green salsa, melted cheese and topped with lettuce, tomato, avocado and sour cream. It's an entire platter of food for only $7. The steak version of this dish is also $7, so they keep the prices very reasonable.

Service was super friendly and fast. I also enjoyed a Mexican Coca-Cola.
