Aye aye aye. 

This is what I'm hablando about Madison. Nay. This is what I'm taco-ing about! I've long said you can take the boy outta Tucson, but you can't take the Tucson outta the boy. Ok, I haven't been saying that long, I just sort of made it up. BUT, point of the story is even though I'm midwest through and through, a little piece of me still craves carne, and TG delivers! 

After telling new friends about my need for a little Mex in the city, they suggested we meet up for a Friday taco fiesta. Glad I met them! There are oodles of entrees, some of which include rice and beans maybe? To be honest, I'm a little foggy because once I looked at the taco and sope options I was sold and couldn't make sense of the rest of the menu. 

Chicken, steak, pork, pastor, tripe and beef tongue are your proteins, then put whatever you want underneath them. Corn tortillas will run you a $1.75 per taco and a sope (a deliciously fried tortilla that puffs up) is a super reasonable $2.50. Both are great! The sope comes with a touch more... crema, shredded cheese, beans... but don't be dissuaded by the simplicity of the tacos. They're equally as tasty with just chopped onion and cilantro. 

I guess when the place opened it only had seating for just a few folks, but a recent expansion to the back area and some seats at the bar make it so everyone (well, almost) can enjoy.
