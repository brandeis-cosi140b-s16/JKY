The most authentic Mexican joint in town! What are you waiting for? Cheap and tasty.

What's good? everything I've tried on the menu.
I love pastor (pork) and Asada (beef) as the meats. They go fabulously with Tacos or Gorditas and the new Sopes!
Horchata is the most authentic in town - thick and smooth and lots of cinnamon. 
New fave bistec con Rajas y Queso - the beef is so good!!

I love this place. There are so many Mexicans visiting they have to be authentic! They just reopened a few weeks ago and it's really busy, but just go early/late on weekends or be prepared to wait a little.
