Do not judge a book by its cover.

Okay, this place is pretty shabby looking with the neon pink paint and all.
This shack isn't necessarily HGTV-worthy inside either.
BUT, the food here is amazing!

My friends, a Bolivian-American and Mexican-American, adore this place so I HAD to check it out.
We dined in, which wasn't the best experience ever, but the waiter (I think he is the son of the owner) was so sweet and helpful.

If you want authentic mexican food, this is the place to go.
