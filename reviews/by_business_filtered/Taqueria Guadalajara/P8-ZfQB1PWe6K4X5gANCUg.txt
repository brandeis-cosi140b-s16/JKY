Heard great things about Taqueria Guadalajara and expectations were high.  The decor and such are quitey basic but you know that going in.  Staff were friendly and service wasn't slow, unlike other reviewers' experiences.  Unfortunately the food was mediocre (my husband used the words "uninspired" and "somewhat bland").  He had sopes and I had tacos.  Prices were quite reasonable, but I won't be back.
