Move aside, Chipotle, because I've found my new go-to Mexican place in Madison!

After a day of tailgating, my friends and I desperately needed some food in us. Then along came Taqueria Guadalajara (aka I used Yelp). Between four people, we placed an order of their Platillo Guadalajara, the taco dinner (two tacos with meat of your choice, refried beans and rice), the chicken quesadilla and their Huarache Vegetariano. 

25 minutes later, our food was ready, packed and good to go. They also included a variety of sauces (the spicy one was absolutely delicious), some guacamole and chips. All for $35 post tip!

It was tempting not to eat all the food then and there, as the scent of comfort Mexican food wafted through the air. The moment I arrived home, we immediately tore into the food like fiends, and devoured every last piece within minutes. It was a sickening sight to behold, but oh, was it delicious. 

The Platillo Guadalajara was definitely the standout, but everything else held their own as well. 

My stomach actually just rumbled while writing this review. I think it's time to grab some food.
