Taqueria Guadalajara re-opened August 8 after re-modeling due to extensive fire damage.  The layout is the same but everything is new and clean so the place does not have quite the same hole-in-the- wall feel.  It was packed with a diverse clientele and many families out for Sunday dinner.  Service was friendly though slow.  The food was very tasty and portions were ample. My husband had chicken quesadillas, my son chicken tacos and I had the pozole, available on weekends only, and we all enjoyed our dishes.  The noise level is high and tables along the side wall are cramped but overall it was an enjoyable experience.
