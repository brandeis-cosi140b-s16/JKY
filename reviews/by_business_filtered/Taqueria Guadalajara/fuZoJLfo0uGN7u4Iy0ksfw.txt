This place isn't the best restaurant in Madison.

It's not even the best Mexican restaurant in Madison.

Best Mexican-Restaurant-Housed-In-An-Obnoxiously-Pink-Building?

I think we can safely give it that.

A work colleague and I were in downtown Madison the other day and looking for a place to have lunch.  Usually when we want Mexican and are a bit further west La Guanajuatence is our go-to place.  Being further east I scoured Yelp and found that Guadalajara was likely our best bet.

We were not disappointed.

I just want to say that this is only a four-star review because the previously mentioned place got five-stars from me and Guadalajara was just not quite as good.

In every other way other than direct comparison it was spectacular.  I had a chicken sope and a three-pack of tacos.  One tripe, one tongue, and one el pastor.  My colleague had a pork chimichanga.  Obviously, we both had chips and salsa + Mexican coke.

Chips and salsa were good.  I see other reviewers rave about them, but I really thought they were only okay.  La Guanajuatence has a salsa BUFFET w/ fifteen salsas.  You really can't compare the two.

Tacos were GREAT.  The tripe taco was the best thing I've eaten yet this year.  It's probably better than anything I ate most of last year.  Crunchy one one side and soft and unctuous on the other.  It was the highlight of my week, seriously.  So so so good.  Everything else was delish as well.  The sope was chewy and thick and cheesy and delicious.  W/ a little of the hot salsa from the chips on top it was just what I needed to top off the meal.

Service was awesome.  We were on a tight schedule, let the waitress know this and were in/out w/in thirty minutes of placing our order.

I really enjoyed this place and will go again w/out hesitation if we're in the area.

That said, since I gave La Guanajuatence five-stars I don't see how I can give this place the same rating.

Four Stars from me, but go yourself because it's probably five-stars good.
