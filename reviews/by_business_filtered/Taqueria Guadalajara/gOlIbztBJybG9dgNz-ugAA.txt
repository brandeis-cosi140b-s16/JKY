I was in Madison last week to visit my niece, and we went here for dinner. I had a chicken mole, which was pretty good, especially the mole sauce, however was a bit disappointed by the service. Maybe it was because it was on the later side and our waiter was ready to leave for the night, but both my niece and I felt a bit rushed. If we were going to come back another time, I'd definitely come a little earlier. But as far as the food goes, it was pretty good.
