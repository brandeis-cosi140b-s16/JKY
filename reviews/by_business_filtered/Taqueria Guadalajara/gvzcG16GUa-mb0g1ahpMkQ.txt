We have been on the search for good Mexican in Wisconsin. This is it!!!!

Their salsa is fantastic, fresh and you'll want several helpings. The al pastor (spicy pork) is incredible and their carne asada is delicious. I ordered a chimichanga and my husband and and sister ordered burritos. All of it was great, flavorful, generous portions and best of all, AUTHENTIC. 

The service is fast, friendly, and the staff is really friendly. 

We'll be regulars!
