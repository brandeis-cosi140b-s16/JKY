My favorite restaurant in Madison.  The prices are great, the food is delicious, and they even have non-boring vegetarian options, especially the vegetarian huarache and sope, and the potato gordita. 

I'm from Portland OR, where you can find pretty good Mexican food.  This place is by far the best Mexican food I've had in Madison, and beats anything I could find in Pittsburgh, PA.  It even rivals my favorite Oregon Mexican places in Portland (http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-sirenita-portland) and Eugene (http://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-siena-eugene).

If you go, be sure to try a sope or huerache if you've never had one before.  As far as I can tell the huerache is the bigger version of the sope.  The base is a 1/2 inch thick (!) soft corn tortilla, made there and freshly grilled.  Next come the beans.  The vegetarian ones are then topped with grilled veggies, including broccoli and carrots, and a generous amount of fresh avocado (scooped right out of the skin while you wait), and finally cheese and sour cream.  Add some of the delicious homemade salsa (there are two kinds) they serve with the free corn chips, and you've got the best meal in town :)
