I was excited that they served taco de lengua beside taco de pastor which is a common type of tacos. The salsa sauces were perfect to me. I really like the spicy one but not for mi amigos mexicanos. Lol  only complaint is they didn't serve a lot of pieces of lime same as in Mexico,  it's just small piece of it on the plate and that is not enough for the real tastes of Mexican foods.

I also had sopa de pozole. It's tasier than when I had in Mexico, maybe bcoz of the well prepared broth. The ambient was just right. It made me think of the taco places in Mexico. All in all, I definitely recommend u guys for this place if u feel like going out of the American atmosphere for an hour. :)
