All these Yelp reviews hype this place up a bit... I was so excited to go here but the food didn't impress me! The horchata was a spicy (not hot, spice-y!) creamy dream, and my friend described her stuffed chile pepper as a "veggie delight." But the chips and salsa and my other pal's chimichanga were both average, and my Platillo Guadalajara was just meh! The corn tortillas and beans were good, but the beef and veggies were too oily and I didn't like that the cactus side, although tasty, was served cold. Mexican food is Mexican food and it's always good to eat, but I won't go out of my way to come back here! Los Gemelos is still the king of Madison Mexican food in my book.
