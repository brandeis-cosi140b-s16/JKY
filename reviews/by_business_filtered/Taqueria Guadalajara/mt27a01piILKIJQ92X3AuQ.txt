You won't get gourmet Mexican food here, but you will get pull-up-a-bar-stool-and-slab-some-salsa-on-your-taco authenticity. This small place is hard to find, but the tacos and burritos are great, and you'll likely be shouldering up against some Spanish-speakers. The owners are super friendly and will make you feel like you are being served by your long-lost Mexican abuela (grandma).
