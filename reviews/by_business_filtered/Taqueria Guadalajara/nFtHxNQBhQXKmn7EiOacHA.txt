Not the place to go if decor is important to you.  After walking through the kitchen to get to the tables with mismatched chairs in the back, my BF and I suspected we were in for some tasty food and we were not disappointed! 

I had a huarche al pastor- sort of an open faced burrito with pork and he had the enchiladas verde.  Both of us completely cleaned our plates, and even with a generous tip the total was at least half of what we might spend at a nicer place with lesser quality food. We will be going back for sure!!
