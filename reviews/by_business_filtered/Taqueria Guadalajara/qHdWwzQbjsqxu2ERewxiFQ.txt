I can see why this place is loved. They make their food with love. It's authentic alright. I still prefer Casa del Sol and Laredo's any day tho. The salsa is tasty but full of chunks and the really hot salsa is just that, reallllllllllly hot. Too hot to enjoy. But the chimichanga and the steak quesadilla were delicious. Juicy, shredded chicken, buttery quesadilla, great guacamole for only $2! Just watch out for bones in the chicken. I crunched into a large one. Almost made me lose my appetite. Food was too good to stop eating tho. I decided not to mention the bone because I just wanted to have a good time without any drama. I'm not afraid to mention it here tho, just as a warning to you all. Chew carefully and enjoy!
