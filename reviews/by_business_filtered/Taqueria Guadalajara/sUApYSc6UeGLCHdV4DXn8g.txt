Today I ordered a take-out vegetarian burrito from the Taqueria Guadelajara in order to check out the generally laudatory appraisals of previous patrons.  Unhappily, I could not concur with the consensus.

While the burrito was tasty, it couldn't be customized.  That is to say, there was ONE burrito on offer, whose ingredients were mandatory.  This contrasts with other taquerias of my experience which offer dozens of options.

In addition, it was expensive (comparatively).  While the menu listed burritos at $6 each, I was charged $8 (because it was VEGETARIAN?)  Since the most expensive ingredient in a burrito is the MEAT, why does Taqueria Guadelajara charge a 34% premium for a burrito that EXCLUDES it?

In short, the Taqueria Guadelajara burrito was OK, but neither so toothsome nor such a good value as to merit a return.

(Full disclosure:  I'm not a native, so perhaps this is the best that can be had this far north.  I will continue to search.)
