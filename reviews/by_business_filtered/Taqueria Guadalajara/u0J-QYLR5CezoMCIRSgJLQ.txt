Fast and friendly service.  Clean and affordable.  I had the carne asada and pastor Tacos and a side of Orden de cebollitas cambray.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish the taco meat had been better seasoned.  The pastor was not bad, but the steak was very bland.  Everyone I was with seemed pleased with their meal and my husband said we could come back for sure (he is kind of picky). He had the steak quesadilla plate.
