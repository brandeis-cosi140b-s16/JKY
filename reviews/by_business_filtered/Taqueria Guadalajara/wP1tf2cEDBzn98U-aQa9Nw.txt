On a recent visit we met a lovely couple who run the city's Spanish radio station and they recommended this restaurant.  My boyfriend, his son, and I had an incredible meal of pork and cheese tamales wrapped in corn husks, nachos, and burritos.  Just for the heck of it we tried AGUA FRESCA DE HORCHATA, a sweet rice drink that was surprisingly good, albeit in small doses.  Our entire meal cost an unbelievable $26! This was by far our favorite meal of our five state road trip!
