I've been there numerous times. Quite frankly, I don't get the hype. 

I'll keep it short: The food here is good. Tacos are good. Tortas are good. Mole is good. Unfortunately, "good" doesn't get you very far in Madison.

Advice: Go to Guanajuatance for great tacos and, well, everything. Mercado Marimar is better. Hell, even Gemelos is superior.

Sorry, Guadalajara. You just don't cut it anymore.
