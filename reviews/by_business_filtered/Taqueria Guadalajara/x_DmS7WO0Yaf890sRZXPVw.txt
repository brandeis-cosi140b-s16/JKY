I'm new to Madison and have been CRAVING tacos for the past month.  I stopped in for the first time last night on the recommendation of a good friend, and am I glad he told me about this place.

Firstly, the atmosphere is GREAT.  I love the the small, cramped, homey feeling of the restaurant.  The fact that it's a converted house gives it extra character.  You walk in and there's barely enough room for a table, let alone customers. 

I had steak, chicken and pork tacos with rice and beans.  Topped with fresh cilantro and onions and paired with a Dos Equis, it's just what I needed to finish off a lazy Sunday.  

Did I mention it's CHEAP!  I'll definitely be satisfying my taco cravings here again soon.
