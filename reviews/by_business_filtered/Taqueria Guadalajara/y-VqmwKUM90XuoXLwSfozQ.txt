Best Mexican food in Madison. It is a tiny space and I'm so glad they expanded out the back part of the restaurant. The only down side, if you go during the summer, you may need to bring a jacket, they REALLY blast the A/C in the back area. But enough about that. During peak hours, they do get really busy and there may be a short wait. Parking could be an issue too, but nothing that should deter you from going.

Their food is fantastic. The tacos come with just onions, cilantro and lime and a choice of meats. Their sopes are homemade, and are delicious. I also love the tamales there. I prefer the green tamales over the red, but honestly, they are both great. I also love their pork tenderloin in tomatillo sauce, it's spicy and tangy and is so good! Their salsa is homemade, the mild is so good. and the hot one is really smokey and really hot! Pretty much everything there is great. 

If you call for take out, your stuff is ready in less than 10 minutes, so get in your car as soon as you hang up the phone. The tortillas do get a little soggy once they get packed for a to go order.
