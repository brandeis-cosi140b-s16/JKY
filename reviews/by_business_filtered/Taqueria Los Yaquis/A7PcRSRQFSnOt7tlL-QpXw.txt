You can't imagine how delighted I am to find such a place in Arizona! My friends and I have resorted to fast food late night meals after a night of going out and that's just depressing. 

The truck is located right outside Charlie's gay bar on the corner of Camelback and Florence, right before you hit Florence. You will see the sign for Charlie's first so just pull into their parking lot. The club was bumpin that night so the lot was full but the taco stand had almost no line Sunday at 11pm. Even though there were security guards by the club and my friend was a guy, I still felt a little nervous because there were definitely some shady looking people hanging out nearby. So if you're a chick make sure to go with a group. Don't let this deter you from going though, as we sat and ate there were plenty of groups coming by (couples, college kids, high school kids) so I felt more at ease. 

As for the food, I was craving  a hot dog but I obviously wanted the tacos. Solution= I got both (sorryimafatty). Skip on the hot dog unless you're really craving it, its just a grilled ball park dog and I prefer mine all beef. Came with a side of Doritos which I gave to my friend. 

TACOS HOWEVER were delicious! I got mine with all the toppings; the red sauce they put on there is spicy! It burned but that roasted red chili pepper taste is so good. I got the pollo and asada.. both were good but I definitely preferred the flavor of the asada more. My friend got the Asada burrito and devoured it! Burrito had the same toppings as the tacos: red sauce, guac, cabbage and onions. Also ordered a Horchata which was meh: watered down, gritty, and not very sweet or cinnamon-y . 

Prices are more than reasonable, service is very friendly and food is excellent! They're only open Thursday to Sunday nights, I will for sure be back. Maybe I'll check out the bar this time too ;)
