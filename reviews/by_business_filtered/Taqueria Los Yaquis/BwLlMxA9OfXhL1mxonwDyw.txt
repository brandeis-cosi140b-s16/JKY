I was craving some tacos (San Diego withdrawal symptoms) and had this place bookmared.  It was on the way home so I stopped.  The line was pretty deep and took about 15 minutes before I placed my order.  I ordered 2 pollo tacos, 3 carne asada tacos, one mini carne asada quesadilla and one mini pollo quesadilla.  Total for all that food was only $9.00!   Its $1.00 per taco and $2.00 per quesadilla. Here is how they were................

Pollo Taco-  This was my favorite of the bunch.  They have great tortillas and they top them with grilled chicken, guacamole, cabbage and hot sauce.  The cabbage threw me for a loop at first but it actually worked with these kind of tacos.  These tacos are super duper small....2 biters.  For a buck, they are fine.

Carne Asada Taco-  Same prep as the pollo.  The carne asada was flavored decent.  My tacos did have some gristle and fat in them.  They were fair.....compared to some spots in SD, nowhere close, but for Phoenix, they were decent.

Quesadillas-  These were topped the same way as the tacos but cheese and another tortilla was added.  Next time, I might just get cheese/meat.  The cabbage made these quesadillas worse.  Weird texture issues lol.  

Service was friendly enough.  Price was good but I was not blown away.  TONS of people were coming and going though so its pretty popular and may be the best Phoenix has to offer.  If so, Ill accept it but Ill continue to dream of SD taco shops!

That's about it.  Nothing super positive to say, and nothing negative to say.  It was A-OK!
