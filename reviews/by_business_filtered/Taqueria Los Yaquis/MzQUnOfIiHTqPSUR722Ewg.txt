These tacos are delicious, cheap, and worth waiting for!

As someone who doesn't really enjoy tacos, I was skeptical about coming here. However, after that first taco... All I wanted to do was come back, and I did -- the very next day. I love the taco asada! The meat is juicy and tender, with spice added from the salsa and slight crunchiness from the cabbage. And it's only $1! I like to ask for lime wedges to squeeze on my tacos to add a slight acidic taste. I also tried a quesadilla, but I felt like the taco was easier to eat (not so messy). 

The horchata is also delicious and large, serving as perfect companion to those savory tacos with its sweet, slightly milky taste. And what a steal; 24 oz for only $2! 

The line does get long sometimes, but it moves fairly quickly. Bear with it! The food is worth the wait.
