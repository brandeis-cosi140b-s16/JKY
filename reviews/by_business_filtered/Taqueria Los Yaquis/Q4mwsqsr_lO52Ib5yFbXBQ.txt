Good bang for your buck. One dollar tacos? Are you kidding me?! Well, they are pretty small. Still, order 5 and pay $5, and leave full. Not so bad. 

I'd heard good things about this stand behind Charlie's, and finally got around to being in the area during their limited business hours. I tried some of the carne asada tacos, some of the pollo tacos. Both were delicious. I also ordered their horchata. Also good.

This is by no means, a fancy place to take a date, but the food is very good, and you'll feel better about giving this small business your money than it's competitors, namely Taco Bell and Del Taco.
