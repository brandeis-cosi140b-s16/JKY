I agree with all the great reviews here
These are, in my opinion, some of the best street food/food truck meals in Phoenix. The carne asada tacos are legitimately scrumptious. Everything on the menu is yummy but my top three are the tacos, burritos, and the super mega nachos! There is always a line for food whether you are inside of Charlie's or outside on the eating area. They take cash and credit.
