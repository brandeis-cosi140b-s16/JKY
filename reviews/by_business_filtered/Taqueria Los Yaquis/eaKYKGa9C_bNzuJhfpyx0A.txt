Great taco truck that seems to cater to people who go out at night based on the hours. It is attached to Charlies as well which is probably why it's open til 2 or 4am on the weekends. The $1 Carne Asada or chicken street tacos can't be beat for the price! Lots of flavor and very tender, and the tacos include cabbage and avocado as well.
