Good stuff. First time. Went over at 8:30. It was half hour wait but well worth it. Had the steak nachos and chicken tacos. $9.00. The steak is so good. Can't compare to crappy Fili Bs. The corn tortillas are so tasty and authentic. The salsa is yummy. All the ingredients were so fresh and flavorful. Will definitely go again. Kinda wish they were opened all week but why would they? You know it's good when you only have to make an appearance three times a week!
