A great late night stop for street tacos. Their tacos are simple, delicious, and only a buck each. It practically encourages binge eating, which is worth it. Their cheese quesadilla has 4 times the cheese you normally get and at 4 bucks is a steal. They have other food, including hot dogs and hamburgers for your more boring friends, though I fell in love with the tacos and cheese quesadilla and haven't looked back. It's become my late night go-to joint.
Be prepared for LONG lines lasting 20+ minutes just to order, then another 10-15 minute wait during peak time (after 2 am when the bars close). There are definitely some out there people who stop by too. If you've got issues with the LGBT segment of society, then you might want to skip it.
