Hands down, the best Mexican street food EVER!! Run by the nicest, sweetest people. Best carne asada tacos I've ever had. Blow's Americas taco shop out of the water. (Sorry America, your food is still good) impeccable service, get there early though. Lines are long and can take a while since only one order taker for the line outside and the drunks inside Charlie's.
