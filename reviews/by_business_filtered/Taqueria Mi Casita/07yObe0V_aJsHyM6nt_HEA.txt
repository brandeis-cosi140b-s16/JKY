I was really excited to try this place since it's right by my house.  I have been to backyard taco and I thought this would be similar.  I wasn't impressed.  The staff was very nice!! The carne asada just seemed to lack flavor.. maybe I shouldn't have came 30 minutes before close.  Anyways, my suggestion would to try backyard taco. THE BEST tacos around :)
