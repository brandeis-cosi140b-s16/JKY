I stumbled upon this place driving to Taco Bell and wow is it good. Some of the best Mexican food I've had in the valley (possibly the best) is served here. Its near my work so I come at least twice a week. Awesome food, great prices, friendly staff. The owner is always there and great at remembering people. Just try this place, you won't be disappointed 

PS. Try the cabeza tacos
