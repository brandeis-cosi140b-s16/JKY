There are a dozen other reviews here saying the same thing.  The food is fresh and amazing.  Also inexpensive.  I would pay double for what they sell.

I am slowly working my way through the menu but anything fish (pescado) is awesome.  The steak (carne asada) dishes are also great.  I think next I will hit up the pork dishes.  I can't wait!
