Tasty street tacos that look as good as they taste, and very filling burritos.  I had the carne asada which was nice in that it was finely chopped beef, giving it a nice texture over just chunks of beef which can easily end up being too tough.  For drinks they have a myriad of aguas frescas, and Mexican Coca Cola.  Even their condiments are delicious.  The roasted jalapenos are out of this world!  

The staff here are very friendly and attentive, providing excellent service even though this is more of a fast food type operation.  When the line for lunch died down, they went to every table to make sure everyone was happy with their meal.  They take pride in making authentic Mexican food and it shows!
