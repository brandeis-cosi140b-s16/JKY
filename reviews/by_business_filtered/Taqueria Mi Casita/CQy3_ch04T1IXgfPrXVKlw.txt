Best tacos ever ! I moved from OC CA a couple years ago and it was very hard for me to find some good , authentic Mexican food until My hubby and I discovered this place. Not only the food is great and super tasty but the service is awesome! The guys are making your food right in front of you always with a smile, singing and super happy to serve you, which is really hard to find now days. The portions are great, and the meat is juicy with lots of flavor. I totally recommend this place :) it always keeps us going back !
