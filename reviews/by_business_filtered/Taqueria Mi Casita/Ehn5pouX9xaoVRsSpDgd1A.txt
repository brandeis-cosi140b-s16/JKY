Why there isn't a line out the door for the carnitas here I don't know. Maybe those in the know are just keeping it their little secret. 

Well, I'm glad I figured it out because it's the most delicious carnitas I've ever had. It's almost a succulent pork stew, really - lots of shredded pork in a rich, flavorful gravy. I had it first on a taco, but now I get it as a "meat only" burrito with just onion, cilantro and red salsa. Pretty much pure burrito nirvana, cannot recommend it enough.

Other things I've had here are very good also, but it's the carnitas that will keep me coming back week after week. 

And to top everything off, all the guys who work here are sincerely nice, friendly and always in a good mood. Which makes it all the more enjoyable. 

Thank you Taqueria Mi Casita!
