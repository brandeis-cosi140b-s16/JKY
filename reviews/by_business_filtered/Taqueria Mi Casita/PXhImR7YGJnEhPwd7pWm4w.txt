First visit, the carnitas torta is amazing!
It was gigantic.  The other 2 guests I was with had the lingua tacos and they said it was awesome.  If you expect great food you won't be disappointed.  If you're expecting ambiance you'll be let down.  It's definitely a small joint. While we were there it became packed.  I'll definitely go back.
