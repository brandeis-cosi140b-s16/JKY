Mark J. took me here once and swore it was the best Mexican place ever. However I was not really impressed with the food. It was like a B+, maybe. Then again, I didn't get to see the supposedly smoking hot taco vixen who works here. Perhaps next time I will get to stare into her eyes and forget what I ordered too.

For now I will just have the memory of my soggy burrito (my fault for waiting an hour to eat it) and the random zuccini they put in it, which was pretty gross. I think that this place could be pretty good and I just had an off experience. The dudes who work here were REALLY nice so I would like to go back for a second chance.

Who wants to take me here next?
