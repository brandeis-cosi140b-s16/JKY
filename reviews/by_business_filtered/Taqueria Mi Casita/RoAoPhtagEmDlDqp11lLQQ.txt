Food is delicious! Just like the places back home in San Fernando valley in Cali. My husband and I have yet to find a taco truck around here with authentic tacos, we just found it. These tacos are as real as they get! And the breakfast burrito is huge! It was finger lickin good. The people here are very nice and very welcoming. It's clean, nice, and cozy. We just found a go to spot. Highly recommended!
