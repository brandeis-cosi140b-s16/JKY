The time I spent in Hermosillo, Mexico has been some of the best I've ever enjoyed. One of the best parts of going to Mexico is the amazing food, most of the time purchased from street vendors and taco stands. Going to this little taco shop brings me right back there.  They have a big array of meats that you can put into a taco-corn tortillas of course. The lengua(tongue) and cabeza(head) tacos are excellent. Most people are put off by these but I assure you if someone did tell you it was from these parts, you wouldnt even know. The carne asada(steak) is a step above most other places and the carnitas(shredded pork) is melt in your mouth tender and full of flavor. 

Unfortunately, I have never seen the smokin' hot taco girl and therefore cannot give this place 5 stars. But if these posts are correct, then truly, it is I who is the loser here. I would recommend this place over almost all Mexican food places in the area. If you are looking for authentic flavor and the possibility of seeing a hot girl, this is the place for you.
