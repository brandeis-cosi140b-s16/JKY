Tiny, slow, messy, and divey.

That aside, some of the best take out Mexican I've had in town. Just killer street tacos. Great carnitas, Carne Asada, and Lengua if you go that way. The staff is friendly and playful, always saying things like "you want pico de gallo with that my friend?" 

So good that I went back the next day.
