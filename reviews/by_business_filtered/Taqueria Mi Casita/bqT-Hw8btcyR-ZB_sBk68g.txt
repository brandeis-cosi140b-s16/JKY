So the people that classify this as good are the same people that frequent Fili'b's and all of the other laughable places that I wouldn't get caught serving to my dog. Seriously, people, you can cook something so much better for less.

Anyway, I've been a patron here for years, and unfortunately it seems like some of the staff has left and there are new people working there. They don't have nearly the same attention to detail that they used to. Just today, the carnitas looked black, overcooked and disgusting, the al pastor was trimmed poorly and had huge chunks of gristle, the chicken that I had had a nice little bone it it, the jalapenos which were once amazing fresh grilled local jalapenos were disgusting goopy messes that I later puked up.

I really miss this place from a few years ago. The shaved headed guy that called everyone "my friend" was awesome. Their Al pastor was just insane. Too bad.
