I moved here from Laredo, TX which borders Mexico...Nuevo Laredo and yes I am Mexican.  When I moved here I was very depressed when I found out that Arizonan's thought that fajita's were nothing but sirloin steak with peppers and onions added.  True fajita meat is made from the skirt cut of the cow.  

That being said, Mi Casita doesn't off fajitas but I have now been going there over 11 years once a week, and this is the most authentic taco shop that I have found in the east valley!  The staff is fun friendly and dang their good rocks!  I stand by it 100%, before going here when my wife would ask to go out for Mexican food, I would give her a shopping list and say, "no way I will make it :-)"  Now this place has good rice not the best, as personally I am biased and think mine is better than any Mexican place I have tried here in AZ.  I would recommend if you are looking to have some great carne asada tacos or a burrito that is just ridiculously huge this is the place to go. Snip it from wiki pedia about carne asada, "In Mexican cuisine, carne asada (literally 'grilled meat' (specifically beef), though any type of dry heat cooking may be used)[1] is made from thin marinated beef steak, usually skirt steak, flank steak or flap steak."

so the above are the variety of meats that can be used.  Skirt is more expensive here so most of the local taco shops will use the flank steak, but if done right and they do it right is excellent!  Please try this place out if you haven't already.
