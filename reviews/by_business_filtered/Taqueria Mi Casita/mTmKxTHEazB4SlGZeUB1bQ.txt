My husband and I love this place. I love their chicken tacos and my husband gets the chorizo tacos. Their prices are great and they are also very friendly. I would never have tried this place just by driving by because it's kind of hidden amongst other stores, but my husband's work sometimes buys their food for parties etc.. and so he told me I had to try them. I was pleasantly surprised :-) Delicious!
