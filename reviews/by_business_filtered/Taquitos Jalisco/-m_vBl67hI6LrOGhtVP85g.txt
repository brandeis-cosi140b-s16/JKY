I love this place so much! So much that I'm writing my first review on yelp ever...coming from California it was hard to find a good Mexican food place out here...they are small but have so much to choose from...the girls that work there are friendly and quick...me and my fianc√©e had gone in to get my favorite pregnancy craving but were 1.50 short, instead of making us take something off the girl said "that's okay it's only food" and let us have it anyways...I go to this place a lot and will continue going there for forever...
