Fish tacos = Excellent.  I will be going back again this week just for these.  The creamy, spicy sauce was addictive.

Rice and beans = Even these were a cut above.  The refried beans had this smokey note to them that kept me interested.

Flan = Dessert was well crafted and huge.  I could only eat half.  Would have tried the Tres Leches Cakes, but they were sold out.

Service = Very friendly.  Clean restaurant.  Reasonable wait time.
