A very pleasant find.  Some small independent shops just don't seem to care - they're running on autopilot - while others pay attention to details.  I think of it as "intentionality".  
This little place is clearly run by someone who is intentional: it is clean, well lit, uncluttered and well maintained.  Things are organized: from their ordering system (stationary iPads), to the kitchen and the staff.  
The food was very tasty.  I had the simple #11 Daily Special: a large cheese Quesadilla and 3 rolled tacos with guacamole. Everything was well prepared and properly cooked - no lumps of un-melted cheese - the tacos were hot, the guac,lettuce and cheese garnish were cold.  And even though I took my food to go, it was placed in the "to go" box as carefully as if I were eating in.
I've tried a few places like this that I wouldn't take my family to.  Taquitos Jalisco is now on our family-approved list!
