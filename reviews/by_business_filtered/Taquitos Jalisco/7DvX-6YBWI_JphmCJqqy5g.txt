This place is great! The only reason they get 4 stars is because there is only one bathroom shared by all! But if you don't have to use it, okay then 5 STARS!!! The food is authentic down home Mexico fair. The choices in sauces and condiments will get you when you enter. Then the food selection is great and they offer several combination's. Also they have a nice lunch menu where you can get several items and a drink for a fair price too. You will have to ask for it to go because you get so much that you will have leftovers! The tacos are crispy and stuffed with clean fresh lettuce. I got the fish tacos and they were fresh and delish! Also this is a very clean establishment, don't judge it by the outside. If you do you will miss out! And they have a drive thru!!!!
