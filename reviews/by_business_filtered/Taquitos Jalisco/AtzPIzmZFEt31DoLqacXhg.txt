My one star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the food the food is actually very good. Management needs to get their act together put a sign with their correct business hours. It says it's open from 7 to 10 p.m. On Wednesday I showed up at 7:45 a.m. And waited until 8:20 a.m. Still nothing I called the phone number that was provided on Yelp no answer I knocked on the door people were cooking in the kitchen the manager was mopping the floor nobody responded. By the time I left there were 3 other people waiting to getting in and eat. It's obvious the management doesn't care about their customers with her lack of respect for the customers may be that is their culture who knows its sad they have great food & piss poor service.
