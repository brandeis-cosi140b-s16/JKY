don't be put-off by the outside of this place.  it looks a bit... hole-in-the-wall-ish, which it is.  but the food here is really good (and cheap)!

I ordered their special, which came with a burrito and taquitos.  The taquitos are basically little rolled and fried tacos.  Not very healthy, but sure are delicious.  The best is when you visit the salsa bar and try some of their different salsas.  I think the special, which comes with a drink, ended up only being around $8.  

The salsa bar also has some interesting offerings, such as sliced (possibly pickled?) carrots and other veggies, which we didn't try.
