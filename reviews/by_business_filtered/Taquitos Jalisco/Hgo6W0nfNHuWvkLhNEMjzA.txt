Nestled between used car lots and and a dive bar, this looks like the kind of place I'd never go. Within, it contains the best Mexican food that I've had anywhere. Most places that I eat, I wonder, why is this or this even on the plate, it's unpalatable and excessive. Jalisco is the place where my wife and I literally eat all of the sauce, every drop of food and liquid on the plate. Everything tastes homemade and delicious. It it never crowded and always provides great food and quick service. We have easily eaten here over 30 times and this is our go to place when we expect a great and affordable meal. Our total ticket price for two people is usually $20 or less. I'm very happy this place is not located in Phoenix or anywhere popular as I enjoy have a private spot that no one seems to know about. 

The fish tacos are the way fish tacos should taste. Tasty, fresh, crunchy, with a midly spicy sauce that is to die for. The enchiladas have the best sauce we have ever tasted. I am not exaggerating when I say that we eat the sauce by the spoonful. My only tiny gripe is that the drink sizes are small, but hey, this is a good place to be if that's my only complaint. 

I've had meals all over Arizona from the cheapest fast food to expensive $200 per person dinners. This Mexican place puts to shame restaurants that routinely charge $30 and up per person. I'm convinced that the only reason most restaurants are open is because people have no where else to go. Jalisco earns it place.
