My first time came here because of what i read on Yelp! first thing I noticed lots there were lots of local Mexicanos eating here..GOOD sign! Very friendly staff!  I noticed they do not automatically serve Tortilla Chips & Salsa...had to order it separately the salsa bar was clean, well stocked & tasted exceptional! I noticed a lady coming every 5 to 10 mins to replenish & clean the salsa bar! Excellent service! Highly recommend this "hole in the wall"
