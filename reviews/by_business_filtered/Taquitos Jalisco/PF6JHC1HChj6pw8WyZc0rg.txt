After eating here about a dozen times and this place being one of my favorite Mexican spots I will never come here again. Yesterday I stopped by and got the chicken fajitas. About an hour later I started getting very sick and long story short ended up in Banners ER with food poisoning. My roommate ate my last little bit of leftovers and started showing symptoms (major diarrhea) this morning.
