Ben W.  Is correct.  This place is a magical land of Mexican food.  I somehow shut out everything around me and focus on the deliciousness of my fooood! I'm not a fan of carnitas but WOOOW  the carnitas tostada is soooo incredibly delicious. I ordered it the following day after trying my boyfriend's carnitas tostada.  It was cooked to perfection, the burst of favor sent my taste buds into a frenzy,  and the tortilla- oh my goodness- the tortilla makes the prefect crrruuunch noise when it's bitten into. Everything we ordered: El pastor and carnitas tostada,  Carne asada and El pastor tacos,  rice and beans and horchata, out of this world! Highly highly recommend, my fellow yelpers.
