I've been here twice now, and each time this place is packed to the gills!

The food is pretty decent quality, especially considering it is TOTALLY CHEAP! They have a small patio out front with plastic-y picnic benches, too.

They have a nice salsa bar that always looks clean (before I get to making a mess, that is).

I haven't ordered one, but the burritos are insane and make Chipotle burritos look teeny.  

Free wifi, not that I used it.

Warning: the restroom looks straight out of the ghetto. AVOID!
