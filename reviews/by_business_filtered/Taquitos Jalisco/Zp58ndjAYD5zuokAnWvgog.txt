Went here for lunch. Not much curb appeal, but the inside is quite charming. It has an authentic Mexican d√©cor. They have a wide variety of items, some that are not usually found on traditional Mexican menus. The food was excellent. We didn't leave here hungry. The only thing that was a little annoying, was they charged me 50 cents for using plastic instead of cash.
