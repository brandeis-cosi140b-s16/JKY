If you are in the mood for quick, authentic and delicious Mexican street food, this place deserves a visit! The mixed asada and pastor tacos served with a whole grilled onion are terrific. The meat in the tacos is crispy, which is reminiscent of push cart vendors in Mexico. I swear the quesadillas are made with home made flour tortillas and the cheese is authentic gritty queso quesadilla. 

Oh, and the little salsa bar has a variety of tasty salsa's with which to drench your tacos. 

Definitely will be back. If you are in Mesa, give them a try!
