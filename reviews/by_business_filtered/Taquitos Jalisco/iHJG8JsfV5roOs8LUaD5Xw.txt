I've been coming to Arizona the past couple years and this is my first time stepping out of Phoenix and Tucson into Mesa Arizona I have to say the best food in Arizona is in Mesa this place has some of the best Mexican food in Arizona Green chili was delicious the tongue  burrito was outstanding and the tamale oh the tamale soft and delicious. Great job
