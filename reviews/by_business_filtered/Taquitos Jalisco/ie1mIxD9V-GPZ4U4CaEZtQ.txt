At first I was EXCiTED to try it out!!  I got the fish taco combo! Now it was good but not gr8! The beans tasted like they were from a can and the rice portion was soo small. The fish taco was fairly small. The meal alone was $8 which I think should have been more around $6. 

My BF got the shrimp quesadilla. Which was $8 too. The quesadilla was greasy! I was extremely bummed of the overall taste!  I don't know if I'll be returning back!
