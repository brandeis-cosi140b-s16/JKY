Not your run of the mill taco/burrito shop! I have been here several times and ordered something different each time. Everything that I have had has been great. Their small salsa bar has some tasty salsas, the plate portions are more than you really should eat really but it seems to just disappear from off of my plate. My only problem with this place is that there isn't one closer to my house.
