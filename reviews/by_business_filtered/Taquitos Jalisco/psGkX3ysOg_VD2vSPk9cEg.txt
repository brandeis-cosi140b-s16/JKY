Thanks to Mark R for introducing me to this place or I'd never have found it. On the outside it looks like all the other dumpy run down Mexi places in Mesa, but on the inside they have amazing food!  Not only is the food good the prices are cheap.  I also love that they have a drive thru that is quick.

My favorite thing to order is the #12 daily special, for less than $6 you get 2 fish tacos and 2 carne asada tacos with a drink.  The tacos are the small street tacos, but they sure are filling.  I had never had fish tacos until I came here and they are one of my most favorite foods now.  Their steak quesadillas are delicious too.

If you eat/go inside they have a small salsa bar and all of them are tasty with a good amount of heat.  

If you're in the area stop in and check it out. Yum!
