This is probably one of my favorite go-to places in Mesa. Open till 10pm and always welcoming you with a smile. And the food is great! Affordable, tasty, and so many options! I'm obsessed with their daily special carne asada burrito and their chicken spinach enchiladas. If I ever come here after a bad day, after that first bite into my meal, it's wiped away.

Also, the incredibly friendly and accommodating staff is a HUGE plus for me. On a few occasions I'd arrived with a big group, so we had to sit at one of the outside tables. Even though they were busy, they kindly brought our food out to us.

Sometimes the line to order is long (since so many people love their food), but once your order is taken, service is quick. The atmosphere inside is cute and colorful, and the strung lights on the patio give it a relaxing, almost festive vibe. They have a salsa bar with some other add-ons, such as limes, if you so need. 

If you're ever in the Mesa area, considering stopping by Taquitos Jalisco! I know I'll be.
