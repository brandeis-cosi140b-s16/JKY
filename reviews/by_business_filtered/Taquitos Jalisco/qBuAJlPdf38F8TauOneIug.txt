I have been craving Beef Soup and hoping to find a  place that sales the good stuff like my Hispanic friends Mothers and WOW, I found it.  The Cocido de Res (Beef Soup) is sooooo good.  I am definitely happy that I have come across this little spot.  It's a little small, but clean and appears family oriented.  Love it!
