Simply Great! Diverse menu. Salsa bar. Seating indoors and out. Gum ball machines. Friendly staff. Low prices. Quick. Tasty food. Kids meals. Everything you could possibly need, assuming you don't need white table cloths.

Taquitos Jalisco does look a bit sketchy from the outside, but the interior is actually quite nice. Come on in! The restroom could use a remodel, but that's my only criticism. No big thing. They do charge 50 cents for the use of credit and debit cards, but that's a small price to pay for keeping the menu prices so low.

A "go to" Mexican spot if you're in the area of Broadway & Alma School or Extension.
