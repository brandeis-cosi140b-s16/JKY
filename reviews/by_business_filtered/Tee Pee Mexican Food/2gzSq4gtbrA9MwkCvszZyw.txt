I came here last night with some gfs to grab dinner and drinks and watch the Angels game.  I guess I was on a subpar Mexican kick, after hitting up 3 Margaritas for margarita shakers.  The place itself is cute, very old school, and I love the comment on the menu that says no cigar or pipe smoking.
My and the girlies went to the bar, because it's playoff time and I need my Angels fix.  The bartender was really nice and friendly, and was doting on us the whole time.  Love being a girl!
We started off with chips and salsa, which were just okay.  The salsa tasted very sugary, and was way to sweet for my liking.  The margaritas weren't anything special, as they have the sweet and sour mix flowing for the soda gun.
For dinner I got two fried shredded beef tacos.  Definitely no street tacos to be found here.  How sad.  The tacos we big and piled with tons of shredded lettuce and cheese.  Yeah...I'm just guessing this isn't how it's done in Mexico.  Actually, I know that's not how it's done.
The portions were huge and I'd already been filling up that sacred real estate in my stomach with booze and chips, so I was only able to finish one taco.
I'm glad I stopped there, because I was feeling sick and greasy for the rest of the night.  Definitely not a feeling I enjoy.  So even though the food was priced well and the bartender was awesome, the greasy food and lack of authenticity will stop me from coming back on my own free will.
