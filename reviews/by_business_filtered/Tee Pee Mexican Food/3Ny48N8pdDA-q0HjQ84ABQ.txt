A very important indicator of Mexican food is the beans. Unfortunately, Teepee served up overbroiled, dry beans. A 2nd indicator is the Margaritas. A drink with Patron should have a bit of kick; the bartender had a second chance to get it right - no luck. Caution: very noisy.

Service was excellent. However, there isn't much reason to return given neighborhood competition.
