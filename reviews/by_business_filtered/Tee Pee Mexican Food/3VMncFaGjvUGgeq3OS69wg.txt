Margaritas?  How about a glass of lime kool-aid with mezcal instead?  Oh yeah, eat the worm too so you're at least in a position to consume less of the steaming hot mess they bring out on a plate.  What'd you order again anyway?  That's right it all looks the same at this dump.  Melted piles of "processed cheese food", the whitest of shredded lettuce you can find and brown or dark brown meat.  Yummmm...

Chips and salsa, you say?  Man, I remember when Chi-Chi's hit my hometown and chips and salsa was something new.  Rewind the track to the 80s when they bring out the chips and salsa but leave the flavor behind.  Maybe that's where the jars of Chi-Chi's salsa went and this place even took the time to add water and wipe the salt off the chips.

Wow!  George W. Bush sat here?  The claim to fame is he ate here and his picture was on the wall near my booth.  The worst President of all time sat at my booth?  Did he make my enchiladas too?  I blame America that this place is still in business.

This place is terrible...  It's possible the sign should say Pete's which is another place to avoid.

I vote to widen Indian School to add two westbound lanes just to put this place out of business.  If you do visit, stop and get some T.P. on your way home.
