Meh.

I had the feeling when I got inside of Tee Pee it'd be meh, and I walked out feeling meh (but full).

Had the fish tacos (plate looked bigger than it was, mostly lettuce and tomato, but the fish was decent), and the burro enchilada style (OVERLY saucy / salty and cheesy...like it was DUNKED in sauce, which to me, when i get a "wet" burrito, is usually not the case, with rice/beans afterthought). 

I'd say this place is more TEX-MEX than mexican. The food is good, but what keeps people here is the portion size and in your face flavor of the enchilada style burrito.
