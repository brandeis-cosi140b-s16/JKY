What's not to love? The TeePee is a great, old-time Phoenix restaurant where the food is hearty, fresh and well prepared, the staff is always friendly and prices are very reasonable. The total absence of corporate glitz and hype is very refreshing these days and makes me feel more like I'm among friends than just another unit served. When I go to the TeePee I know that I'll be treated nicely by the staff, have plenty of time to enjoy my meal and be able to escape the rushed pace of daily life.  It's among my favorite places.

Highly recommend the special chile relleno, but everything is good.
