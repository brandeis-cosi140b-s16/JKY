I like Tee Pee. It's just a basic tacqueria that's been there for a long time and has fairly cheap food and fairly decent table service. You can get a lot of different basic Mexican items, including the Arizona version of a burrito (called a "burro" here). Margaritas are a bit watered down and can be ordered by the plastic pitcher, but if you speak up they'll mix in a bit more liquor for you. One warning--the salsa is hot! 

Good place to go on a weeknight with some friends. Plenty of families in there, too. I'm guessing there's a wait on the weekends, though I haven't tried.
