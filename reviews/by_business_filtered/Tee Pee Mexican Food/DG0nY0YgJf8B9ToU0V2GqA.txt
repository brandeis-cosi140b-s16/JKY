Very disappointed in this place!! Took an hour for our food to come out, our sever was very slow. We sat there for a good 30 minutes, our server never asked how we were doing during that time. A table of 10 came in, then a table of 4 came in and even they got our food before us! After munching on chips and salsa FOR AN HOUR, we finally got our food. I'm a server, so I know exactly what happens in the kitchen. I truly believe he forgot to put our order in. Yes, an honest mistake. But to not say sorry at all? That is what made my boyfriend and I upset. After paying for the full meal(no discounts), no sorry, we paid, tipped and politely asked to talk to the manager after our meals. She shrugs her shoulders, says sorry and basically couldn't care less. I guess we just had a bad experience, along with horrible customer service!
