Just ate at TeePee, lets see. The place from the ourside looks a bit shady. Inside its dim lit and if you look around, you'll notice it is not the cleanliest. I ordered the chicken enchilada, i figured you cant go wrong with that. As the server brought out the dishes for my coworkers, i noticed the rag that held the hot plate dipped into the cheese as the dish was placed on the table, this happend to two of the dishes. But the waiter was just oblivious. My dish was flooded with cheese, somwhere beneath it be the enchilada. I figure ok, its a bit much on the cheese, no big deal, ill focus on the actual wrapped goods. As I opened up the enchilada, i noticed there was a good size layer of cheese on top of the actual chicken. To be honest, I think I ate three small pieces of bite size chicken bits. The rest was just flooded with cheese. By the end of the meal, i had enough cheese left over to make a happy face for the waiter. Bummer, I should have taken a pic for your enjoyment. Overall, I will never eat here again, there are lots of other restaurants on my list waiting to be discovered. I give TeePee a sad face. I should have listened to my co-workers warning, never eat at a joint that has a drunk bull as their logo.
