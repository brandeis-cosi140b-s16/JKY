The Tee Pee is a Phoenix institution and known for its monster Chili Rellenos. I was traveling with a friend who loves Chili Rellenos so I thought it would be a perfect choice! 

As our waitress delivered the plate, you could hear the gasps and people asking "what's that?" as she walked by. It was indeed a monster creation. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to its hype. Under two massive mounds of egg souffle, there was one little green chili with a little bit of cheese. My friend didn't like it at all. I liked it a little more than he did, but I think he was right when he said it must be their "gimmick" dish. 

Even though the Chili Rellenos disappointed, our waitress (whose name I failed to get .. arghhh!)_was excellent. She was so nice and friendly, but not in that sickeningly nice way. She was attentive and incredibly accommodating and helpful. 

We would definitely try the Tee Pee again, but would just order something different next time.
