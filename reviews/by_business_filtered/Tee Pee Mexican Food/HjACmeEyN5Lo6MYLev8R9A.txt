It's frustrating that Mexican food is SO regional in style and flavor. Having lived in Texas for most of my life I am accustomed to Tex-Mex. So naturally, I haven't had much luck finding any Mexican food that reminds me of home. However, of the many restaurants that I have tried here in the valley, this one has been the closest and the best...so far.

The dish that I got could've served two people but the idea was to try a variety . The tamale was very good and the cheese enchilada was surprisingly even better. And being someone who never raves about Mexican rice, it feels a little weird saying that their rice stole the show. It was very good. Overall I was happy with the quality and taste. 

I dropped in for lunch on Sunday and it was packed. Luckily there was an open area at the bar, where they had NFL games on 3 or 4 tv's. The bartender was extremely attentive, never letting my coke sit half empty and refilling my chips bowl a couple times, as well. I will return!
