Say what you will, Im kind of digging on the Tee Pee... It looks a bit divey... and the food was so hot I burned my lips off.. but thats not a TP prob, thats a airhead Kimberly problem! The chips are a bit on the staley side.. but I loved the Huevos Rancheros.. the place was packed... good margaritas, good salsa.. good service.. all deserving of my 4...
