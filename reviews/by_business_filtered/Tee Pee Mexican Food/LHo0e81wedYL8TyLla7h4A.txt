Ok, so let me preface this by saying, no one likes this place but me, my uncle from Indiana, and the one childhood friend I still have who grew up in Arcadia.

I know, what an endorsement.

It's an institution. It's been around forever. It is not healthy in any way, shape or form. It is fat kid heaven. It is a sour cream, enchilada, lard-loving, cheese explosion, saucy dream of a Mexican dive that I will never stop going to. 

This place has lasted for a reason. 

P.S. If you want a skinny margarita, you are in the wrong place (although, all you have to do is ask). Why do people not get that most margaritas are a just a shitty mix? Spend the money on the Cadillac and stop being so cheap.
