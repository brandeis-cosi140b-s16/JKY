Back in the 80's I worked down the street at Old New York and lived across the street at Villa Manana.  I enjoyed coming here with friends and co-workers, sharing pitchers of Margaritas and trying my first Chimichanga.  Fast forward 30+ years and this place is now more of the occasional, sentimental stop.  The chips and salsa are yummy, house $3 Margs are rather tasty compared to many other restaurants house Margaritas.  Listen, I'm really picky about such things.  I don't want syrup and flavor on ice -tasteless, expensive, and lacking that kick that takes the edge off of the day.
Lunch was tasty and really satisfied my desire for a taste of the past.  I had the Red Chimichanga, which comes with sour cream AND guacamole.  Other restaurants charge extra but here it's already included.  Two thumbs up.
Service was just okay.  Kinda slow but always courteous and professional.
Overall a very positive experience.
We'll continue to make our visits here at the TeePee part of our random routine.
