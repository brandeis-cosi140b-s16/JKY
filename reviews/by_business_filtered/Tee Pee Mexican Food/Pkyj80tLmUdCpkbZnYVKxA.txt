my boyfriend and I are  vegetarians and recently went to teepee and not only did they mess up our orders terribly, they were unapologetic and tried to barter with me about what would be taken off of the bill.  My boyfriend and I both had steak in our burritos, so we obviously complained to our server, his response was "oh well, stuff happens" and said his manager will take one of the burritos off of the bill. We both do not eat steak and we both had steak in our burritos so why is it acceptable that we would be paying for either one?! It was rude and insulting. The owner also walked by us multiple times and didn't even stop to apologize. We will not be going back!
