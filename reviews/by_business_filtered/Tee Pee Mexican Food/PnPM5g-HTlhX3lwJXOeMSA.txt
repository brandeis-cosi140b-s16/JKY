I'm not crazy about Tee Pee. 

My parents, however, are. As are, it turns out, most Baby Boomers that grew up in Phoenix. 

Once you walk inside, the photos on the wall of famous patrons over the years gives you a snapshot of their (self) important place in Arizona history. 

Tee Pee was one of the first places to popularize Mexican food for gringos, from what I gather. Non-mexican families began going out to eat here regularly and Mexican cuisine became part of the Arizonan identity. 

Unfortunately, I don't feel like their food holds up in comparison anymore. The authenticity has faded and given way to a new generation of Az-Mex, one that I prefer, if for even reasons of circumstance. 

I recommend it for out-of-towners almost as a historical stop but not too much for the food. It certainly isn't bad, if you aren't expecting greatness, but the food won't be what you walk away remembering when you leave.
