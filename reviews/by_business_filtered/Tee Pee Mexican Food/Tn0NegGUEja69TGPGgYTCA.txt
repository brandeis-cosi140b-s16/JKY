Reviewing Mexican Food Restaurants in Phoenix is a little like sports talk radio folks trying to compare boxers.  There are so many differences.  How do you compare a boxer in the heavy weight division to a boxer who fights in the welter weight division?   How do you compare a light weight to a super-light weight? It's hard.  and it's difficult to do with Mexican Restaurants as well.  When attempting to talk about boxing there is a term people like to use, "Pound for Pound", meaning if they weighed the same, this boxer would be superior.  

"Pound for Pound" the Tee Pee is my favorite Mexican Resturant in the Valley.  Sure, there is a place in Scottsdale that has Green Corn Tamales that are to die for.  LOS DOS, in South Phoenix makes some killer dishes with Hatch Chilles.  But overall if I could only eat at one Mexican food place the rest of my life The Tee Pee would be it. 

The Green Chile Burros are excellent.  The Margs are fantastic and everyone I have ever taken there loves the Salsa.  I especially like the Cheese Crisps and when ever I go there I just ask for the daily special, which they have been serving for like 50 years.  A Taco, Enchilada, Tostada combo.  Wonderful.  Check out the Tee Pee, a family run restaurant who is serious about their food.
