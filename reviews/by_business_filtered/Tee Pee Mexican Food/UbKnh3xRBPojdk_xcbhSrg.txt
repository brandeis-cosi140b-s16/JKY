The Tee Pee's been around since the 1950's and there's a reason why.
Their dishes are some of the best in the valley in my opinion.
Not all of them, but certainly their stuffed chile rellenos and green chile dishes. 

One of their boastful claims is how former President GHW Bush visited on at least one occasion, evidenced by their naming a menu item in his honor;  'The President's Plate'.

This leads me to wonder if Bush was laid-up the next day with a severe case of red-ass, and if that led to any world war-type events. 
I know the day after my birthday celebration I was shittin' razor blades, and god help anyone who came in contact with me that day. So I can see where Bush might be all; 
"Oh yeah, Cheney? Well I'll show that piece o' shit Saddam what swift American justice looks like. 
Someone get me a red button to push, STAT!!!
Oh, and wet wipes too-somebody PLEASE get me some wet wipes-fast! 
"I'll teach Saddam Hussein a lesson he won't forget anytime soon."

Anyway, if you like Sonoran style Mexican food, but more importantly, hot Mexican, try Tee Pee.
