Heartburn City.  So, it's an institution; OK.  It is an interesting place.  But come on, the food is so so.  And over-priced to boot.  My friend and I both got heart burn.  On the plus side the wait staff were very attentive, although they didn't seem to appreciate a real Mexican eating there, or maybe it was just that they didn't know us.  I won't go back.
