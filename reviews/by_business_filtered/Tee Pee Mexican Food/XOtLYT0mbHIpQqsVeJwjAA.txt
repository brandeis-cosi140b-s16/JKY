This place has been around forever...and looks like it.
The night I went for dinner they seemed a bit unorganized at the host stand. We waited about 20min to be seated. The table and booth were just a little on the greasy/dirty side. 
I know this is a greasy Mexican food place so I ordered enchiladas...gotta love anything smothered in cheese.
They arrived after a significant wait. The enchilada sauce had a pool of grease floating on top which was a little unappetizing. 
The flavor was just meh. Not horrible, but I am in no hurry to return.

The bar seemed like a fun scene with a bunch of regulars, so I might be back for some cocktails before I eat dinner somewhere else.
