When I return to phoenix, I always look forward to authentic Sonoran style Mexican food.  What a disastrous disappointment when I tried the burrito at Teepee!  Tortilla was soggy and beans tasteless, and the enchilada sauce was maroon! This restaurant used to have a strong reputation; now it is a total loss.
