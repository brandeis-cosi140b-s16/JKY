Why does this place have so many 1 and 2 star reviews? I just don't understand. I have been coming here for YEARS. Even before I went the vegetarian/vegan route. I used to have birthday party dinners here when I was a kid. This place has always been my favorite Mexican place to eat at, and is always super crowded with people. You should have seen it the day after the Superbowl. It was a mad house! But because I love it so, we still waited the thirty minutes and ate here anyways.

The service is sort of touchy. Some times we get really good servers who are friendly, and other times we get the ones who just rush and take your order and don't bother to care about you at all. Really though, as long as the service is fast, I could care less about whether or not they talk to me. It is just nice when they do. 

The food is always hot, and always comes out super fast. I always order a bean chimichunga with no cheese, no sour cream, and all beans on the side with no cheese. The lettuce and tomatoes they put all over every dish is slightly annoying and I always forget to ask for them to take it off, but whatever. I love my bean chimi. 

Whoever comes here and expects to get 5 star Mexican food is kidding themselves. You can tell from the outside of this place that when you come in here, you are going to get some greasy bad for you Mexican food. And that is exactly why I frequent this place. When I am in the mood to just eat greasy food that's going to make me feel like I just ate 3000 calories, I come here. Because even being a vegetarian, you have to have a place where you go to eat bad for you food.
