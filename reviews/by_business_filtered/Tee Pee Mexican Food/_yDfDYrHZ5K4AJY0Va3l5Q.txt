I walked in and it felt like the help all knew everyone there. The bar area was full and there was just 2-3 tables open. The tables are close together, so you feel like you're sitting with the person at the next table, but that was ok.

The chips were warm, but cooled off quickly. The dip wasn't too hot and it was a good combination while I waited for my 'Tee Pee Daily Special'.

The special was a tostada, taco and enchilada with rice and beans. All tasted good. 

The food was good, the atmosphere was better and the help was wonderful.  Now it's 2 hours later and I'm still full. If you want to see pictures, check out my blog at pmonahan.tumblr.com.
