I was excited about this place after doing a search for "best chimichanga in Phoenix" on Google, but it didn't live up to my expectations.

I ordered the carne asada chimi but part of me wonders if that's what I got.  I couldn't taste much of the spices, especially the cumin.  There were also some sauteed onions inside so part of me wonders if I got the fajita chimi on accident.  There just wasn't much taste to the meat which made the chimi average overall.

The rice looked fine, but it had a burnt taste to it.  Maybe something happened with the broth?  I love beans smothered in cheese but there just wasn't much taste to either of them.  After a few minutes on the plate it hardened up and needed to be cut into sections by a fork.

A couple of bright spots....  The salsa is good, both the regular and the hot.  They bring you a massive bowl of chips to snack on.  The waiter, I can't remember his name, was friendly and outgoing.  Also, I tend to like to overall feel of these kinds of places.  Not too fancy and looks old school.

One last thing....  I went there on a Saturday mid-afternoon and the bar section was completely hopping.  I'm not sure what that was about but my guess is that if you're looking for a place to put back a few on a Saturday then try Tee Pee.  I just can't recommend the food.
