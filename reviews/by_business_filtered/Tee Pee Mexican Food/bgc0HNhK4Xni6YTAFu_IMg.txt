"We can say we tried it."

That was our reaction when we left. We drive by this place all the time, and it is usually packed, so when we had an open night we decided to see what it was all about.

We had stale chips, and possibly the worst "house margarita" in the history of house margaritas. It was more like a guest-house margarita. Maybe the outhouse margarita. My wife had the chimi, and liked it. I had enchiladas, and they were okay. 

Oh yeah, and the seats. They are old booths, aren't holding up very well. Mine had a broken spring or something and the guy sitting behind me made me jump everytime he moved, and I think I did the same to him. Quaint seating is one thing - broken is something else.

I did like the home-owned, non-chain feel, but it just wasn't that great.
