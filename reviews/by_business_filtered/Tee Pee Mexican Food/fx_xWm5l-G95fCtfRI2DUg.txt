Not a bad place to to eat some mexican in the valley... this place it not super nice but the food is good... if you do to this location you will see alot signed pictures of all the people that have been there...  it is pretty cool...  

If you go check out the chile reanllo... it is the craziest presentaion i have ever seen at a mexican place... it is also not too bad... i would go back... the only problem is that there can be a pretty long wait for a table... but i would say it is worth it... the chips are also real good!
