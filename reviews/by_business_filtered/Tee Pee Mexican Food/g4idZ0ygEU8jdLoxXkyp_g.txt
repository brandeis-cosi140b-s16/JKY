Great food and good service. Always have warm chips and consistently good salsa.  Typically go for one of the lunch specials---large potions, served hot, and quick.  The decor---yeah, it is pretty dated.  The dinning area is not at all conducive to large groups---but for a quick lunch, it is a good place to stop..  Especially like the bar area.
