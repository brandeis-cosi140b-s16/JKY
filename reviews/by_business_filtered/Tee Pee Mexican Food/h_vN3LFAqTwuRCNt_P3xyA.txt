I have been to Tee Pee three times and keep going back. Its a little pricey and crowded but a good dive-like Mexican food place for dine-in. I am surprised how many low ratings they have on Yelp, maybe people were expecting something fancy? TRY THE CHEESEBURGER. I know, I know, why would you get a burger at a Mexican food joint? But it's HUGE and really good.
