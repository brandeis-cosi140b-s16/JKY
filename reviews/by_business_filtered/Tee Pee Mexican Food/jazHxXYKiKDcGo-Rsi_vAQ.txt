I love the Tee Pee.  When I lived in Scottsdale as a child, we would frequent here.  You're always bound to see someone famous eating here.  As for the food, I think it's top notch.  I came back about 4 years ago and it was the same, excellent.  Excellent chicken enchiladas, wonderful beans, and their cheese is terrific.  Their tortillas are really tasty and I love their chips and salsa too.  And they have a lively bar at night, you really can't beat the Tee Pee.  During lunch hours, they have cheap, filling lunch specials.  When I'm in Phoenix, I'll be here, for sure.
