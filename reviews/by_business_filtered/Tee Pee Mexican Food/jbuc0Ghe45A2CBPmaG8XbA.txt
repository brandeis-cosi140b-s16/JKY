Went tonight with the family for dinner.  Service is below average and has been for years.  The part that really got me was that I ordered fajitas -- with no sour cream.  My wife asks for a side of sour cream.  They charge us for the side.  My son and I ask for more tortillas (as they give you only 2) -- the waiter takes 5 min to bring out the wrong thing, then another 5 before he brings the right tortillas.  Food cold at this point.  They then proceed to charge for extra tortillas.  DON'T NICKEL AND DIME YOUR CUSTOMERS!!!  ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU SCREW UP.  GREAT, PRESIDENT BUSH ATE THERE, WE GET IT.  HE ALSO ATE AT A MILLION OTHER PLACES.  GET  YOUR ACT TOGETHER.
