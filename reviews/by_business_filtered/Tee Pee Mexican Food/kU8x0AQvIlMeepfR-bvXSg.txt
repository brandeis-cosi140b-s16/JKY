I've been coming here for 20 years.  The food has remained excellent and I love that they don't change much the food nor the interior of the restaurant.  I don't understand the bad reviews except to say that maybe some of them are looking for more upscale places.  This place isn't meant to be a fancy joint but the food and service is still good as ever!  Ask for the presidential booth!
