Take away its storied history, its George W. Bush honorary enchilada, its wall of fame....what do you get?  Just another greasy cheddar cheese enchilada served by a place that makes Mexican food in the old style, before we really knew what Mexican food was.

Having said that, this place is still a landmark and when you are in the mood for the faux Mexican that we all grew up on, you invariably make your way to the Teepee.  It is the reigning king of the Taco, Enchilada, Burrito world that was once our only portal to old Mexico.
