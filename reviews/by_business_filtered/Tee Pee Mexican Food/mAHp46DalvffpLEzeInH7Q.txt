I love Mexican food, and am always on the hunt for another place to try. Oddly, I heard about Tee Pee via a news article when John McCain was in town -- apparently it's his fave place to eat in PHX. 

But it's Mexican food so off I went. Even though the place was hoppin' on a very rainy afternoon, I got a seat fairly quickly. The place is the epitome of "hole-in-the-wall" and "divey", but the food was awesome! I got a chimichanga and had the chips and salsa, which were all good. The service was pretty good. The place was loud, so I'm not sure that I'd recommend it for a date. 

Parking is tight, especially if they're busy. And it turns out I've driven by it on Indian School several times but had somehow overlooked it.
