Nice bar, but otherwise gringo slop. This is amateur hour people. Their food  is a colossal failure. It's no wonder Bush likes to eat here when he is in town. No self respecting Arizonan or Mexican would ever return here for a second gastronomic beating. The beans were crap. The enchiladas were crap. The tacos were ok at best. The salsa wasn't great. There should be a helpline.
