I'm not sure why all the haters.  My wife and I had a GREAT experience here.  We frequent Mexico a lot.  Now, while this isn't the most authentic food, the place is great!!  I love spicy food and the salsa was spicy.  Too hot for my wife to really enjoy, but I loved it.  I usually add habanero to my salsa, but not here.  :)  Food did NOT come out super fast, that's because it's not pre-made and then nuked. (Sorry Drew) But it's great, we had super service and enjoyed the heck out of this place.  It's pretty close to Sky Harbor too.  Fortunately, we didn't know "W" ate there beforehand or we might have avoided it.  That being known now, I'd still go back.
