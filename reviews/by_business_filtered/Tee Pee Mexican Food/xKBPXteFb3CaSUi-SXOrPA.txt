According to Yelp, three stars is "A-OK" and that's exactly what this place is, OK. This place is the embodiment of okay. 

I have relatives in Phoenix and my wife and I treated them to an early dinner at this place when we came to visit. According to my cousin, this place has been around forever... restaurant longevity is impressive, the food here however, is not.

My wife was craving guacamole (she always does) and it was bland and a bit watery. The enchiladas were almost good and the re-fried beans were fairly well seasoned. They were served super hot, which is a good thing in my opinion. 

The service was just below average. The staff was nice enough, but a bit slow and not as attentive as is necessary when you have a table full of people with refillable beverages. Hello! It's 110 degrees outside, of course we want refills on our icy drinks!

Next time in Phoenix I doubt I will end up here again, but if I did, I'm sure it would be okay... just okay, okay?
