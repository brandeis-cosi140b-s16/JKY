I've been here numerous time in the past two years. I've ordered the tacos, tamales, carne asada, and albondigas (to name a few). They were all spot on and very tasty. This establishment has a nice local charm to it and the food matches this charm. It's a bit on the heavy side when you opt for rice/beans with your meal.

This place is also great for kids. We brought our baby and it was fine (it's louder here). I also recommend the house marg on the rocks.
