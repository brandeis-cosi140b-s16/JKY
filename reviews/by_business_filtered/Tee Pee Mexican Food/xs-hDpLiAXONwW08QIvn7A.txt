I have a love/hate relationship with Tee Pee. I love their chicken enchiladas, rice, beans and salsa.  The chicken fajita soft taco's that JD gets always look good too. But once I was seriously disappointed by the balloon-boy looking chile relleno thing. Last night we went expecting gooey cheesy goodness and a couple of margs and one of us left with a toothache. 
On a whim, JD ordered a mexican pizza with fajita chicken instead of ground beef. It came and looked so good I had to taste it. It tasted good too. I was impressed and things were looking great until Ccc-rack! The pizza had some unexpected metal in it. We told our server who later explained to us that the slicer used to cut the pizza had broken and left behind the rivet that JD tried to eat (?) That just seemed odd to us, and we both left with a bad taste in our mouths. The pizza wasn't on the bill, but it is definitely still on our minds.
