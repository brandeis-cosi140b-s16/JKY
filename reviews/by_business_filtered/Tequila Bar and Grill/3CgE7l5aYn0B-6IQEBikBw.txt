A must if you happen to be in Bally's and in need of a quick bite that won't break the bank.  $14 for a huge plate of beef or chicken nachos with three tacos of your choice included, has got to be the best deal on the strip.  Follow that up with $3 modelo drafts and the must have infused tequila shots and expect to leave full and hammered for under $50 total for two people.
