The tequila bar is a great little place! We come here almost everytime we are in Vegas because it is such a great deal and has very quick service! They have $2 tacos and $2 margaritas!! This is probably the best deal on the strip!! You can choose from shredded beef or shredded chicken and they come with cheese, lettuce, salsa, tomatoes and sour cream. The margaritas are pretty big, probably the size of a solo cup, definitely worth the $2. They also have a queso fundido dip that is EXCELLENT!!

PROS: The $2 deal is the best! There is a 2nd deal for $14 that is 3 tacos and an order of nachos. The nachos are insane!! The plate is overflowing and is probably enough for 4 people to eat off of! Great deal!

CONS: This is not a glamorous place by any means, its a simple little restaurant no bright lights or anything like that. If your looking for a place to be seen and get dressed up this is not your joint. 

TIPS: If you are in Vegas without a Total Rewards card your crazy! Everywhere you go (that is a Total Rewards owned property) you can earn comps with it and most places give you a discount as well. It's free to sign up so why not. The tequila bar is another place that offers you a discount if you have a total rewards card so be sure you bring it!
