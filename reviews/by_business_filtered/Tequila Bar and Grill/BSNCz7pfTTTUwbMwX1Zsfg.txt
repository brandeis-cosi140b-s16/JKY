Good enough find inside of Ballys. If you're walking through the casino, you'll see the signs offering their reasonably priced drinks and tacos (great for pre-gamers). However, once you're inside the place, those $2 margarita signs disappear completely. Make sure you ask your server for the $2 margaritas and draft beers specifically or else you'll end up with a $7 margarita...that doesn't offer anything justifying the extra $5. My advice, get a couple of the $2 tequila shots and dump them in the $2 margarita; VÃ­ola, a fantastic way to start the night on the cheap.
