Went for dinner, had great drinks (razzarita is really good, my sister really like the watermelon cooler) food was pretty good too, Im not that big of a fan of tamales but were pretty good and had the alambre tacos which were very tasty. This place is however pretty expensive, me and my sister shared an order of tacos and tamales, and had 2 drinks each bill was around$80. The service was good as well.
