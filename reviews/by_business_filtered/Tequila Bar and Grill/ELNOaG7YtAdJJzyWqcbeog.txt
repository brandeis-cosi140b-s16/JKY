Good bang for the buck for late night food, especially if you are staying at Bally's.

One thing to keep in mind is that there is a separate late night menu after 11p. I came around 2a hoping for some ribs, but ended up with steak and eggs for $10 instead. Steak was perfectly cooked (char broiled)  to medium rare and everything was a healthy portion size. I think Bill's across the street has some better deals, but if you are tired, even that's too much of a walk.

The $2 tacos and margaritas are always available though they don't appear anywhere in the menu though they are on posters all through the casino.
