Ive only been here (multiple times) after a long night/early morning of drinking and have always order the El Hefe Nachos. They feed about 4-5 people easy and are only about $16. A hidden gem inside Ballys! 

If you love nachos...go! I believe they are only offered on the late night menu between midnight and 6am.

I would give a 5th star if they had more late night employees as it seems to always be only 2 servers for about 20 tables.
