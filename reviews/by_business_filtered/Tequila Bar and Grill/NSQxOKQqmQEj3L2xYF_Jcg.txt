Such a dump, the servers are unprofessional, place is dark and dirty. The tabled have the paint scratched off, I saw several people sit down and leave. I got a drink and it was awful, got an almost $20 thing of nachos that were HUGE, but was mostly chips with some beans and hidden little chunks of chicken (dark meat) and a small scoop of guac.
Don't go here, walk to Paris or another place, even McDonalds would have been better.
