Wow. $1 tacos, $1 beers, $1 margaritas. And they were all good. 

The margaritas are blended only out of a machine and regular or strawberry. The beer I think is limited to Miller Lite and Modelo. Other dirnk items such as top shelf margarits and plenty of different kinds of tequila to choose from.

The beef tacos were slightly better than chicken tacos but both were delicious for only a buck. The quesidillas were also good with lots of toppings. 

The service was mediocre.  I like to think that it seemed like everyone sat at the same time and it got really busy, but I think it was more that the waiter couldn't handle multiple types of drinks at a time, let alone every other request.  Like not having any napkins on the table and we were halfway done with the food.

Very loud, especially when all of the games are on. Pretty much first come for a table. The bathrooms are far to the left outside oft he restaurant or to the right and all of the ways down the hall to the conference center. Either way, don't wait until the last minute to go.
