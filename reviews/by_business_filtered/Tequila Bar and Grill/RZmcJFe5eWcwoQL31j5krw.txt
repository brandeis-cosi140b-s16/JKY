A casual American restaurant with a friendly menu serving burgers, ribs, nachos and cheap drinks with HUGE PORTIONS near the casino in Bally's, Vegas - good for mixed groups, guys and satisfies a drinkers craving for a hefty, greasy meal. Portions and price point are the sell here.

My two girlfriends and I drank $2 Margaritas and shared El Jefe's Nachos Grande ($16). Fully-loaded with layers of toppings and cheese, the nacho platter was literally the BIGGEST platter I've seen in my life. We stuffed ourselves silly (and regretted it soon after) and it didn't even look like we made a dent in it. I recommend sharing the Nachos Grande with 6-8 hungry girls or 4-5 hungry guys. 

3-Pound Texas Challenge: Ultimate BBQ Bacon Cheese Burger $35
You get this burger and fries free if you finish it. This hungry man named Joey was up for it while we were there and he didn't even finish half. Wall of Burger Finisher Fame had only a mere ~17 people.
