My boyfriend and I almost ordered the "el jefe nachos" but luckily the waiter warned us that the plate is way way way too big for two people and that for a few dollars LESS we could get a smaller plate of nachos plus three tacos! The tacos cannot be mix&matched so I ordered one extra chicken taco for $2. So the food comes out and the plate of nachos is still big enough for a table of 5. I could barely believe this wasn't the largest one, definitely didn't need that extra taco. Everything was really good! Also, this was around 3:30AM so we were surprised to find something so good still open.
