Me and my friends usually go late so the band plays right next to the restaurant, so it's pretty loud. That is my only complaint.

The food is cheap but really good! The dining area is small but soo comfortable. I like it because the servers can always see you and all the tables are in one room. 

I have been to this restaurant several times and will continue to return :)
