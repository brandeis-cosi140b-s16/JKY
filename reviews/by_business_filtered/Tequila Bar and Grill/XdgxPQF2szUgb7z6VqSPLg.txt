This was a great find especially on that end of the strip. Getting to the bar was challenging but it fit our needs perfect. - a cheap inexpensive snack to hold us over. We got the $3 beer and $2 margueritas which for the price was great. The $2 tacos were good I liked the steak over chicken and didn't care for the chili sauce and I was expecting just beef and shell but they were a good sizes served with toppings. Service was fast and friendly. Nice cheap stop.
