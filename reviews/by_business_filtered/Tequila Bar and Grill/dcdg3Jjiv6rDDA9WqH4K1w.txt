Going from Bill's or O'Shays in Vegas just wandering around getting drunk, our friend and I make it a point to stop by the Tequila Bar to get the Fish Bowl that has a drink that looks like an AMF ($20).  After that, make sure to down some tequila shots for those that didn't make it to Vegas ($2). Then down it with a tall pitcher of Modelo, because liquor before beer, you're in the clear ($7).

After we do all the things above...well...let's say that stays in Vegas.

Specialty: Tex-Mex

Recommendations for first timers: $1 Tacos (i hope they don't raise the prices)

Service: 9/10 Variety: 10/10, Parking: 10/10 

marc out.

btw: they make margaritas really strong, so if you're into that then definitely a place worth checking out.
