Disagree with the last part of Ken M's review. You get a decent amount for your money by splitting the big @$$ nachos or ordering the 3lb burger for a group of people instead of just one person.

Individual sized entrees are way overpriced and saying the food is mediocre is actually a compliment. Save your money, and your gas, go to your local Roberto's or any mom and pop taco shop for MUCH better and cheaper food.

As for the 1 dollar taco and margaritas, either this is a limited thing they only offer during happy hour or it's on a secret menu because none of the servers were talking about it and no where was it on the menu.
