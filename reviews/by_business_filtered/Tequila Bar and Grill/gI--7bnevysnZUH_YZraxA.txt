Not that I am expert in Mexican Food....although I do give credit to my moms cooking for these 50 additional pounds. This bar is in a hotel. This bar tequila is not of any quality. Want a hangover? Get it here. Want quality tequila and NOT get a hangover...see my review for the Venetian tequila bar. The food gave me food poisoning. The tequila was cheap. The workers try hard and are running like crazy to ensure they meet everyone's orders. Good workers....but management need to watch Restaurant Impossible to reflect on their purpose. Hope to return....
