At least the staff was great- they gave true honest opinions of the bar food. The bar staff didnt mind chatting with you at the bar and the beer on tap was mighty cold. Great for a $2 beer out the door. Now that I think about it... why didnt I grab more from here while the wife was sitting at the slots! But thats all it is- food nothing to ride home about, unless youve had too many $2 beers!
