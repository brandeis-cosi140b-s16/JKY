My group of friends came across this place while we were searching for a late night bar/grill to eat at. We all didn't really expect much, and the menu sounded pretty good, so we decided to drink and eat here.

The service here was VERY slow. After getting seated, our waitress came and got our orders about 15-20 minutes after. There weren't that many people there, so there was no reason for slow service. After ordering, we had to wait another 20-30 minutes to get food. We decided to order a round of drinks while we waited. This also took quite a while, and she also forgot one of our drinks. 

The food here is not that great. Their tacos are extremely plain and shitty tacos that look like leftovers. However, the nachos looked amazing, so there are some things that are good (you just have to do some research). 

Overall, a terrible experience. The wait is long, the food is bad, and the food price is ridiculous for what you get. The only upside is that it's open somewhat late, and the drinks are pretty cheap.
