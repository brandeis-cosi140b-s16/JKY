"Yay! I'm a fan." Yelp helped me decide that 4 stars is the best rating. I considered 5, but a friend who dined here with me 3 times says, she wouldn't. Or, in yelp terms, it's not "as good as it gets." 

For us twentysomethings trying to save money during our trip to Vegas (Clearly. We were staying in Bally's after all. No offense to anyone who loves the place, but there are more luxurious options on the Strip), we became fans of Tequilla Bar and Grill. Really, anyone who wants more gambling money can save on the food expense by going here. 

The dollar tacos lured us in. Four was a good amount. The waitress told us she preferred the beef over chicken - you get a choice - because of better seasoning. I tried both and agree. Tacos are topped with lettuce and cheese, with sour cream and guac. Not bad for $1. Small margaritas are also $1. What brought us back in the second  time was the menu item that I called giant nachos. See picture to understand. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The third time, we indulged in the fishbowl drink. Not pictured, but you can imagine. Comes with straws for as many amigos as you brought, says the menu.  

Overall Tequilla Bar and Grill doesn't seem completely organized in how it operates (seat yourself, slow service), but the waitstaff was charming enough. The menu options show a fascination with ample size and value for food and drinks, which I think is good for the Strip.
