Great place. I think I went there every day for the week that I was in Vegas. The first thing I had coming off my flight from OKC to Vegas were their nachos and a margarita (9am, and I'm okay with that!).

 The nachos seemed expensive and then they brought them. OH DEAR GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE? I think I was going to sob because of how purely gigantic the mountain of nachos was. Maybe because it was my first flight ever and I was ready to curl up and cry already, but yeah. Thankfully I had my boyfriend with me so we conquered Nacho Peak.
