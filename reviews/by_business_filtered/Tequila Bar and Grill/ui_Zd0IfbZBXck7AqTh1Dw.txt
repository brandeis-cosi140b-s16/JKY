My wife and I hit up this place last night when trying to find something to eat at Ballys. The staff was very friendly. And I get the food out to you quickly. We ended up ordering wings, nachos, and tacos... With a few drinks of course :)

The nachos could definitely feed two ppl! The food overall was good. But no wow factor :-/ Something we found quite enjoyable were there fishbowl margaritas and tequila sunrise!
