Great specials found this place walking thru Bally's going to Paris.  $2 tequila shots, 8oz margaritas, and taco's all day, everyday!  Service is a bit slow, but service was friendly and the place was very busy when we came in.   I had 2 chicken taco's that were great, stuffed full of chicken, lettuce, and a lot of cheese.   Great place for cheap eats in Vegas which is hard to find.
