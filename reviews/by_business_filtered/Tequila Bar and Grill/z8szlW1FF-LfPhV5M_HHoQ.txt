I went here with my in-laws and all our kids, 13 people in total. We took advantage of their awesome weekday specials, $2 beer, $2 margaritas, $2 tequila shots, $2 tacos, all day. Tacos were tasty. We also ordered bottomless chips/salsa and "El Jefe" nachos - biggest plate of nachos I've ever seen! Our server Sonia was a doll - patient, accommodating, good sense of humor.  We left full and happy for $130, tip included. Would definitely go again!
