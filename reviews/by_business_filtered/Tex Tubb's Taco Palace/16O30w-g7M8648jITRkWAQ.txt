Great little taco joint in the Atwood neighborhood! We went for lunch the other day and each got a taco platter. I love that there are many types of tacos to choose from with unique flavor profiles. I got the blackened fish (good, but not remarkable) and the house-made pork (AMAZING). We also shared some queso. I had the jicama slaw on the side which was a little too creamy and bland. That aside, the overall meal and service was very good, so I'd be happy to go back.
