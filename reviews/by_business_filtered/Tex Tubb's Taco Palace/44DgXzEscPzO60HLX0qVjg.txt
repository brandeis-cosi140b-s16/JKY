This is one of my favorite restaurants in town. My wife and I have eaten here dozens of times. I've celebrated numerous events (birthdays, that kind of thing) here with friends, family, and coworkers.

I'll start with the margaritas. They're expensive if you compare them to some place that serves a BS mix poured into cruddy tequila. But these are real-deal margaritas, made with real squeezed lime juice, orange liqueur, and good tequila. You're not gonna get a 32oz monster like you would at Pedro's, but trust me... they are plenty strong. I've been working on my own margarita recipe for a while, and Tex Tubb's makes my second favorite margaritas in town.

The food... so good. I'm a big fan of the tacos. Our favorites are the green chile chicken (my wife usually orders just these, two or three of them), the hot mama, the house smoked pork, and the pork belly. Really just wonderful all around.

The wait staff is my favorite in town. They're very nice, funny, and helpful.
