I went to Tex Tubb's with a larger sized group -- about 8 -- for a small birthday celebration a little while back. Despite my review of two stars, let me start off by saying I think I was there on a bad day for service and they deserve a second chance. Our meal was an assortment of errors and mistakes, but despite that the food was good and portions were good. I think on a different night, we'd see something different.

I had the tamale special, which was tasty. However, I had ordered chicken and not pork. Not cool, but no big thing for me. The birthday girl's drink order went in and disappeared into a void. The time for food to come out of the kitchen was inordinately long. Personally, I thought our waitress was great and totally on top of things and the kitchen was just lost in the sauce that evening. 

There were other errors, but most of them were not major...just a cluster of minors. The food was still good and I'll be back for a second visit. Hopefully they'll be better sorted by then.
