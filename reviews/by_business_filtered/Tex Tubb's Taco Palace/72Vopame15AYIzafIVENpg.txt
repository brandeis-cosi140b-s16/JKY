I really like Tex Tubbs.  I can't speak to the drinks, since I don't drink alcohol, but they have an excellent array of very unique tacos.  I don't love all the different varieties, but they're all well made, interesting, and fun to try.  You can also mix and match, if you want to try a single taco of some type, without committing your whole meal to it.  The nacho plates are huge - you'll need at least two people to get through them, and you should count on them being your whole meal unless you have 4+ people, or eat like a horse.  I've tried the burritos/chimis once or twice, and they're good, but that's a little like going to a steak house and ordering a burger.  If you're at Tex Tubbs, you really should get tacos.

The salsa bar is good, if not particularly diverse.  It'd be nice if they added one more type of salsa, and maybe change that one up every week.

The prices seem very reasonable to me, considering that the food is fresh and well-made.  It's somewhat more expensive than Chipotle, but it's also better food.

I agree with the other reviewer who said it would be nice to get free chips with a tex-mex dinner, but I suppose they'd have to charge everyone more, even though not everyone wants chips.  And frankly, when we do buy chips, I have trouble finishing my entree anyway.

The restaurant tends to be crowded and can be noisy, but that's what happens when you stick a good restaurant into an old building.  Think of it as "having character".  The atmosphere and experience remind me of Pepper's Pizza (RIP) in Chapel Hill, which billed itself as "a sunny place for shady people".

We always try to avoid "Family Night", which I think was on Mondays during the summer.  It just attracted too many noisy kids.  If you have noisy kids, it's a great time to take them, since I won't be there.
