I deviated from my usual choices at my most recent visit around noon on a Saturday, since I was wowed by the breakfast offerings on the menu, all of which sound freaking amazing. I've never stopped in so early before, so I was unaware. I recommend checking them out asap!

I had the blue corn pancakes served with chipotle butter and ghost pepper maple syrup, and I can't even tell you how g- d- great it was. I think I was levitating off my chair for time, it was so good. I don't even know how to describe the magical way those ingredients interacted.

For a side, I had the $2.99 slab of ham, and I do mean a slab. It's as big and thick as a steak, and super flavorful and tender. My g-d. What a deal, what a breakfast, and to even have a great margarita with it just seems like a crazy amount of happy for a gray Saturday.

I was bummed by the rude hostess when we arrived, and I did let the staff know, and they more than made up for it with the rest of the service during our visit, not to (again) mention off-the-charts-good food. So, yeah. Go visit Mr. Tubbs at your earliest convenience.
