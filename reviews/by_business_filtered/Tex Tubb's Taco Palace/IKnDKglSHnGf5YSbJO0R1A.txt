Best tacos I've had in Madison so far.  Got the three taco platter and could only finish 2.  The sauces were incredible and the sweet potato fries on the side were super crisp and tasty.  Try the hot sauce on the table ("Mandy's" I think), it's smoky and not too spicy, went really well with the pulled pork.
