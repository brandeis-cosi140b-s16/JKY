If I would have written this review 4 years ago it might have been 4-5 stars.  It seems TTTP is losing its focus on quality.  

For starters, the salsa bar now offers el-cheap-o cups, while it doesn't affect quality, it takes away from the experience.  But on to the salsa.  Maybe the recipes were changed, maybe a bad year for tomatoes but the flavor is nowhere what it used to be, was it a cost cutting measure? Chips:  I seem to recall "in-house" made chips, the chips we had did not seem to be fresh.

Taco's - not bad, I miss the Ã  La Carte and the hard shells.  They seemed to have gone over the top too, no such thing as just a 'classic' taco.

$8 for a margarita on the rocks? steep, even by Madison standards.

Overall, I'm sad.  I loved coming here, but it's off my radar now.
