Lunch at Tex Tubbs was a treat! 

Service was warm and attentive, food was tasty and generous in portion, and the atmosphere was casual but inviting. 

The fajitas came out sizzling-hot, and were flavorful with just the right kick. I'd definitely recommend them! 

A huge thanks to Jessalyn, my server, for a fantastic experience. 

5 stars to y'all, thanks for the great afternoon break.
