CHICKEN BONES were found in my friend's burrito. The waitress assured us that this is normal and happens because they hand-shred their chicken. STILL NOT OK!

First walking in, the atmosphere was nice and seemed like promising experience. But that quickly changed when we noticed that nearly the whole staff seemed unfriendly and not very happy to be working there, including our waitress. A simple smile go can a long way, trust me!
When we informed her that we utilized the Yelp check-in for free chips and salsa, she seemed annoyed! Seriously??
The food was decent, but I've certainly had better at a more affordable price. For one margarita and the fajita plate, my bill was over $20. Certainly not a budget-friendly lunch spot. 
I was happy that at least they comped my friend's bill after she literally had to pull chicken bones out of her mouth. We don't plan on ever returning.
I can truly appreciate a friendly, helpful staff and decently-priced delicious food, but you won't find that here.
