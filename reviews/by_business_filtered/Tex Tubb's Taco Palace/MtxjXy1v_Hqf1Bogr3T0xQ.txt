Greetings, fellow taco lovers! I originally hail from California so I know super amazing, crazy authentic Mexican food. Having said that, I have 2 pieces of really good news. #1: Tex Tubb's is NOT a Mexican restaurant so I won't be comparing it to anything back in Cali and #2: They've created some seriously kick ass, super fun, tasty tacos that I will go back for time & time again.

Yes, the taco salad is fine and the black bean flautas are good. But the tacos, my friends, for me, the tacos are where it's at. Tonight I had the pork belly taco for the first time and it had everything - crispy pork belly, bright flavors, unique, light, balanced. I can't wait to have it again. The original carne asada taco is my main go to. I always get a great taco when I order the carne asada. The fish tacos are also fabulous, you can't go wrong. 

The salsa bar makes me so happy. I really love it - it's kind of brilliant to have such fun variety along with a serve yourself option  And the queso dip, OMG! Stop it!!! I could make a meal of just that & the salsa/chips. AND the palace margaritas are wonderful! There's a lot to love at Tex Tubb's including the great service of all the hardworking staff (thanks, Matt Fanale)! I'll be back soon. I'm sure I'll see you there.
