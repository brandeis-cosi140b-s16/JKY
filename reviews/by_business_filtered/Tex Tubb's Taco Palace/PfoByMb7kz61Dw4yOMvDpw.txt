If you like roaches crawling over your food before it is made you will love this place. Absolutely disgusting! Oh and don't bother going to the bathroom they are horrible.


Someone complained about my review. I am sorry to you but the building is full of roaches. I have been in the kitchen. I have seen the roaches. It is disgusting. IDK Why I got flagged for telling the truth. I guess it's like they say. The truth hurts. 

If you want me to say something nice here it is. The booze is good and cheap.
