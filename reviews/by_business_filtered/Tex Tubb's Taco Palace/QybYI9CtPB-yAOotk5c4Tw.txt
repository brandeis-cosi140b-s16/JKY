When Tex Tubb's opened it was so exciting. A taco place within a five minute walk from the house. Unfortunately, the excitement was short lived. I've had several less than stellar customer service experiences there, and the food just isn't worth the price. It's not disgusting or anything, but just not that great. I've always thought it was a bit odd that the owner charges a cover ($5.00) when his own band plays at his own establishment. What's up with that? Maybe two to three bucks, but five bucks is a bit steep.
