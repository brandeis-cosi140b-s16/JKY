Madison is severely lacking in authentic Mexican restaurants, so sometimes you have to go for the next best thing - Tex Mex. Cue Tex Tubb's Taco Palace. Stopped in on a Tuesday night because, well, I was in the mood for Taco Tuesday and I had heard good things.  Little did I know how many taco choices there were! I've sampled about 6 types of tacos now and they were all DELICIOUS. I loved the unique flavor combinations, the creative themes of the tacos, and the variety of meats and vegetarian options. 

Perfect for a margarita happy hour as well. The basic blended margaritas are only $3 during happy hour and all night on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and the more gourmet fancier ones (amazing) are only $5 at those times, so it's well worth the trip. 

Again, I'm still searching for authentic Mexican food in Madison, but if you want something a little different, definitely try Tex Tubb's.
