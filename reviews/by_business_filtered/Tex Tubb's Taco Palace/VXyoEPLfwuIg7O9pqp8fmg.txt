I've been to Tex Tubb's Taco Palace many times - how did I never do a review?  First - it has Palace in the name...which is a selling point for me!  I have never been disappointed here and last night was no exception.  This place is awesome - they have a great vibe - trendy without pretentious - subtle yet absurd.  You can't go wrong with the tacos.  As a matter of fact last night I had my favorite to date which was the Chipotle braised beef taco.  YUM!!!  Do yourself a favor and step out of that national chain restaurant and head over to TTTP - they are part of the Food Fight *locally* owned group.  You won't be disappointed (unless you don't like really good tacos then you might be ; )
