Favorite taco joint in Madison, hands down. Great chips and salsa. Love the Backyard BBQ taco and the Chorizo & Black Bean taco. The enchiladas are delicious too. They've got my beloved Lone Star and Cholula always on hand. 

The only downside is that their frozen margs might as well be N/A. I'd suggest upgrading to a Palace Margarita or sticking to beer.

All day Happy Hour Tuesday & Thursday.
