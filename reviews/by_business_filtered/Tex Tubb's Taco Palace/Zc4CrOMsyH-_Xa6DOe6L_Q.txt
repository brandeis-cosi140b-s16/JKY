Get the Klenex folks...
It's a year after I moved to Madison-
and I'm going back through the files,
reviewing the first few places that I grabbed grub in town when I arrived. 
(It's about to get sentimental up in hurrr.) 

Tex Tubb's doesn't make the best taco I've ever eaten. 
(Let me explain.)
I lived in Arizona for 7 years, so when it comes to tacos, you're never going to convince me that something in Madison is going to be just as good as the deliciousness that is the southwest. Sorry Wisconsin. A place in Milwaukee comes close (thanks Rachel) and I do enjoy Madison's mex, but it's not the same. Somebody could make a killing in this town preparing authentic Mexican cuisine. We certainly have the growing season.

With that said, Tex Tubb's has a lot of things going for it. 

First off, it's not a Mexican restaurant. I think a lot of people would feel differently if they understood this going in. You're going to have to pay for chips and salsa, you're not going to find menudo or tripe or even carne seca for that matter. But what you will find is a taste of Texas in the midwest. Fried avocados, BBQ shredded beef and taco salads piled so high that they touch the ceiling. (Ok not really, that's a hyperbole.) Flavor combinations are inventive and deliver and I like the choose your own adventure nature of it all, assembling a taco platter and adding sides. You can't snag sweet potato fries at a taco joint in Tucson, but you can on Atwood and for that I'm grateful. I'm also grateful of the hip but not hipster vibe, there's a difference and you should ask me about my feelings on the subject if you care. It caters to kiddies, and while I don't have any, my very first meal in Madison was shared with some, so I dig that. 

Service can be slow, spice is right for Wisconsin but weak for heat lovers, and I'd love to see some seasonal switch ups. Other than those 3 things, the place gets high marks for what they're trying to do.
