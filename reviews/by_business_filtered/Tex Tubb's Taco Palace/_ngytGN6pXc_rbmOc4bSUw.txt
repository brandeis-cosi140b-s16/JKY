I *want* to like this place, I really do, but I've been there about 6 times and it's just meh.  Overpriced and forgettable food- not bad, just not all that great.  Fish tacos were Ok- the queso dip is good, too.  I've had burritos, enchiladas, tacos of every description, hoping to find the dish that will wow me.  I give up- it's not here.  The decor is fun, the 8-track is fun about the first 100 times. Drinks are waaaayy overpriced- I think it was more than $6 for a vodka/tonic.  Yes, rail vodka, kids.

Hate ordering at the counter and fighting for a seat- that stinks.

The photo booth is fun, however............
