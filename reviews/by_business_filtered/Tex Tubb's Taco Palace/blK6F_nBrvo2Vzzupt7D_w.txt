We used to really like Tubb's. We've been going there since opening night. We went back last night for the first time in a few months and were very disappointed. They changed the chips to a tasteless brand that is evidently cheaper. You can get better chips in any grocery store. 

Even the salsa in the salsa bar seemed inferior to what it used to be. They had the same 4 salsas they have always had but they just didn't taste as good.

For our tacos we tried the crispy tilapia which wasn't crispy and had kind of a musty flavor. The blackened tilapia was a little fishy and only fair. Tubs used to wrap the tacos in two tortillas and they have cut back to one. The tortilla fell apart and we had to use a fork to eat it.

The grilled portabella mushroom taco is one I would order again. There was plenty of mushroom and the goat cheese added a nice flavor.

I'm in no hurry to go back.
