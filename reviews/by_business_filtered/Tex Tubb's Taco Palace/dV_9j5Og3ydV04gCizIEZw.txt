I have no clue why I have lived in Madison for 20 years and have still never gone here! A friend and I did lunch there today and had a good time. The server was incredibly attentive and genuinely nice. We got a seat by the window and ordered pretty quickly, since I suppose we both know what we like as far as Mexican food goes. I got the giant burrito with a side of guacamole. And a bloody mary. I'm fairly picky about my bloody Mary's and this one was good! It had tons of garnish and was just spicy enough and didn't have too much horseradish. The burrito that I ordered was also delicious. I got it with shredded beef and the beef was a little bit on the dry side, but overall it was very tasty. Sometimes I shy away from saying anything good or bad about food fight restaurants, because they are food fight restaurants. There's something a little bit corporate about them. But our server and his demeanor reassured me that it is a local business and they do take pride in being local. I will most likely be back again!
