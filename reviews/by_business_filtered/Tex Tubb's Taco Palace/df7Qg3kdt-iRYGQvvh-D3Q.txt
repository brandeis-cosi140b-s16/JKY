Yes, this place gets a 1 and I'll explain why I would give them an even worse rating if I could...

-WAY overpriced. I paid over 5 dollars for a fish taco that had less than 1/2 cup of filling. The piece of fish was like a fat minnow in size. Just wrong. I don't like to be ripped off this badly.

-The people there were rude to me and didn't take my to go order for like 10 minutes and they weren't even the slightest bit busy.

-I waited another 10 minutes for my mini taco before I got it.

I ended up eating in my car, feeling ripped, eating a taco that was a perfect portion for my small dog, but not a real human. And it wasn't even good food. Sad to say, but even taco bell beats this place.
