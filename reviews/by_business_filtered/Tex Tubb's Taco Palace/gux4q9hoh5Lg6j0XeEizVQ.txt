Came here for brunch after the crazy legs run, with a couple who said this was one of their favorite spots. We didn't know about checking in with Yelp for free chips & salsa, but the chips and salsa were really good. I loved the homemade salsa, and definitely took home a few containers of it with my leftovers.

I had the two taco platter with a green chicken chile taco & a pork belly taco. Both were great. This place is casual and they really stick to the tex-mex theme. It's a little out of the way from downtown, but at least that means easy parking.
