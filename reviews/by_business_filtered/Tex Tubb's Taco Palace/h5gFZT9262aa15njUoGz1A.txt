Tex-Mex.  Quirky character.  Yup.  Oh, and great margaritas!  

Right off the bat, if you are expecting authentic mexican food, this is not it.  But it is great food.  TexMex has more cheddar, veggies, black beans and cumin.  And do not get me wrong, I love me some texmex but it can let you down if you are really craving authentic burritos.

When I am in the mood for tex-mex, Tex Tubb's fits the bill.  Margaritas and personality up the wazoo.  We went on a Saturday night and was seated immediately, as opposed to the 30-minute wait across the street at Alchemy (though that place will be saved for another night).  

I had a sangria.  I have not had many but this one tasted swell.  The sig. other had a mule or something.  I guess their tradition is that if you finish off the bottle of tequilla, the customer gets to eat the scorpion that was lingering in it...and yes, yes, he did.  I guess that just adds to the personality of the establishment.

This time we ordered nachos and they are HUGE.  They for sure made it clear that this could feed 4 people so they were smart on that front but we finished it all within 10 minutes because it was that good.  We have also had a variety of their burritos, all of which are great as well.  Oh, and they have a salsa bar!  No scorpions in those, luckily.
