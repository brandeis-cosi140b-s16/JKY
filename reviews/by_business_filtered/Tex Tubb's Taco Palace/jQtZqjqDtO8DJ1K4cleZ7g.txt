I pretty much love this place. The decor is fun, the food is pretty gosh darn delicious, and the location is ideal for me. The seating is a bit tight and it can get noisy, but the valiant and good natured staff does the best they can under these circumstances, so even when service isn't ideal, it's still fine. 

The margaritas are solid, even if occasionally uneven in sweetness to sourness balance. The beer selections are also good, usually including a terrific Mobcraft.

The one, two or three taco dinners are a great deal, you can mix and match from several chicken and pork options as well as steak and tilapia. Toppings are fresh, I love the crunch of shredded cabbage, and the handmade corn tortillas are so light and tender. I would love to see some shrimp offerings as well. I haven't had a bad one yet, and the serve yourself salsa bar makes it easy to customize your dish with the flavors and heat levels you prefer. Portions are generous, I always have enough left over for lunch the next day.
