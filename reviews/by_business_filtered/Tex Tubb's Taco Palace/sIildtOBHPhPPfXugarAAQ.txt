We had so much fun here, & the food wasnt half bad either ;) Four of us, mostly orders taco platters. Tried a variety of different flavors, but the clear winner was the chorizo & black bean taco. Chorizo on the spicier side, so delicious! Jicama slaw was good as well, although needed some seasoning (& a dash of hot sauce!) Salsas were yummy, especially the Verde. Our server was nice & attentive. Only suggestion I have is either get different margarita pitchers, or just serve the ice on the side. Impossible to pour without making a mess. Thanks Tex Tubbs for a memorable dinner!
