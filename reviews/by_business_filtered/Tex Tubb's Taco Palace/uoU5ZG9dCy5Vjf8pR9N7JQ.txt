We've been here a few times and it's consistently enjoyable! Nice salsa bar, but it's not terribly surprising that none of the offerings are particularly spicy. They make a nice guacamole to go with the chips and salsa, so I'd recommend that as an appetizer. 

I like the tacos quite a bit, and the variety on offer means pretty much anyone will be able to find something they'll like. The taco salads are also really good if you're looking for a marginally healthier option. I have not tried the burritos or rellanos, but the tamales are quite nice! I like the black beans more so than the refried, but the rice is probably the most disappointing item served. 

I don't think the iced tea is fresh brewed, so I'd avoid that option. The beer selection is usually quite good, both in bottles and on draft. Tonight they had MobCraft Batshit Crazy on draft, and that's a HUGE win! 

I'd certainly put this more in the Tex-Mex camp thank authentic. traditional Mexican, but it's solid for what it is. Worth a look, especially if you're already over on the East side.
