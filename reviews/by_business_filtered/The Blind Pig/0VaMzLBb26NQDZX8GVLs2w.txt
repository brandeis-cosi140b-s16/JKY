I LOVED this place! I took my friend here for her birthday. We had salsa, guacamole, the tamale, ceviche, and some tacos. The tamales WAS AMAZING GET THAT!!! The drinks were ok. We had the Sangria. In my opinion it was a little weak. 

The service was pretty good, hence the ONLY reason I gave 4 stars. They did a pretty good job, but there were a few times where we could have really used someone stopping by. And although we were sharing everything, we really didn't need it all brought out at once (appetizers and main dishes), Although that could have been a miscommunication.
