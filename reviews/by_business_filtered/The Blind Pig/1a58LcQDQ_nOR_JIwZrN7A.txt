Okay food, atrocious service.

Stopped in here on a whim on a Sunday afternoon.  One party at the bar, and we were the only other indoor party.  At least 10 minutes to be waited on.  Ticket time for some oysters, salad and a burger was close to 20 minutes.  Waiter was more interested in skirt scavenger hunt rather than actually waiting on tables.

Food not much to write home about.  Grilled chicken salad was hot chicken placed directly over cold greens.  Pineapple and beans were straight from can.  Croutons soaked in oil to the point of sogginess.  Oysters were mediocre with a red hot sauce that was better left in its jar.  Stuffed burger advertised bacon, but finding bacon embedded in patty was an impossible task.

For premier pricing, one would expect something better than canned ingredients.  Doubt we'll be back.
