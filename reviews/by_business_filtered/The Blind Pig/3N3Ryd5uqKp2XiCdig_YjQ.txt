Quite a good meal but, I HATE THESE OLD MEN. I was having a good time eating but these old men kept being noisy and telling the same jokes over and over, talking about the way things were in their day. Almost made me spit up my food! Like a baby! But I didn't I prayed that their false teeth would fall out and shatter like glass upon which I could dance and stomp my little footsies all around until I was satisfied.
