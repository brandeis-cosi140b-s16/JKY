Okay, this place is partly owned by the same folks who run Uncle Sal's, which is right next door.  I've actually never eaten here, although it is a restaurant, but have purchased meats here.  Beats the crap out of any grocery store meat.  The cuts are perfect, and while a tad on the expensive side, are well worth it.  They have some unique cuts, as well as the usual suspects.  Never disappoints.  They also have a special (I think it's Tu and Th), where you get 20% off if you are a patron of Uncle Sal's.
