Call the butcher shop this morning to see if they any thick 2 inch steaks.  They didn't but after checking with the boss, the guy said he could cut me one.   When I husband went to pick up they cut to 2 1/4 inches just to make sure.   It was absolute perfection.  Perfectly marbled and was so tender it was like cutting butter. Thanks so much guys at Blind Pig!
