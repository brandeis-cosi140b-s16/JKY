I've only been here once, but it was an awesome meal.  I went with two friends, and we each ordered different tacos, so I feel like we got a nice sample of what they offered.  We also got chips,salsa, and guac.  Everything was delicious, and I would definitely go back.

I'm also interested in checking out their butcher shop.
