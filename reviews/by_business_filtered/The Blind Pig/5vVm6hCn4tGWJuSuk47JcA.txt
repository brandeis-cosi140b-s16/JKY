So if I was given one last meal it would be from the place. The food was unexplainable. Fresh full of tons of flavor and super cheap. I would have paid twice the money for the same food.
Had the wings that are crazy full of flavor.
Orders the shrimp on a tamale all I have to say is stop what you doing and get here now. 
The bartender was super cool and threw this frozen pineapple my way again can't wait for tomorrow I will be back.  Thinking about putting my house up for sale to be closer to this place 

So I tired this place two days late the wings were still awesome. I had the short rib tacos and it was the best taco I have ever eaten. Also tried the chicken  flauta that was full of flavor. Usually you just taste the outside but the chicken was moist and juicy. Stop reading this and go there now that's the only advice I have for you.
