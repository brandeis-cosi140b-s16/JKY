Great food! Had the short rib tacos and guacamole. The seasoning is amazing and meat is perfectly tender. The salsa is a bit on the spicy side but it was yummy. This is a casual laid back place with great food. Service is friendly and place is unassuming. Also tried the carne asada and it was just as perfect. Their rice is an unexpected twist with pineapple and chorizo.
