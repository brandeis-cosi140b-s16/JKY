I went here with my dad for lunch out on the patio. The things that were good were insanely delicious, but the rest were fairly mediocre. We split the guac, the pig wings, and two tacos - short rib and carne asada with the house rice. This was plenty of food. The guac was one of the mediocre items. It had a weird artificial lime flavor... like a cleanser almost. Also, they used pepper in it, which is just plain weird. It was not wonderful. The pig wings were one of the insanely delicious items. They were sooo good! Like the most tender barbeque pork rib with a wonderful glaze.... it, in itself, is worth a return visit. The carne asada taco was one of the mediocre items. It was dry, kind of bland, and nothing I would order again. The short rib tacos were incredible! The short rib was moist, tender, full of flavor. I would get this item again. The house rice was also very good, it is rice with chorizo and pineapple in it.... that is fabulous! I would love to come back here for these few memorable items and to try some new items as well. 


PS the prices are very reasonable, we were stuffed for under 20$
