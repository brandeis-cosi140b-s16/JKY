My boyfriend & I have been eating at The Bling Pig for years! I LOVE their Wild Mushroom Quesadilla and Fresh Avocado Bruschetta! My boyfriend LOVES the Pig's Mexican Pizza. I also love the al Pastor tacos and Torta Ahogada sandwich! The staff is always very friendly and keeps the drinks filled. I love that it is so small and cozy. We miss Hobe Meats in there though. Too bad that was taken out. One of our very favorite spots to eat and relax!!!
