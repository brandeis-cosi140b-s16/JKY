This place is a hidden gem. Service was great, and the food was even better! Loved the salsa and guac. Chips were perfectly crispy. The shrimp corn tamale was absolutely delicious: large blackened shrimp, sweet corn tamale with just the right texture, and a creamy, slightly spicy, full-flavored sauce. So good! Had the chocolate cake for dessert, and it was totally worth it. Just rich enough to be good without being overpowering. Can't wait to go back!
