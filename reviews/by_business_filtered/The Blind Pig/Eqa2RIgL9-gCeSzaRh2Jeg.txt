Being from the Midwest I'm not use to going nice restaurants in strip malls but this one changed my mind. They have a very nice patio with the inside being a little small. The service was not the greatest (did find out our server was bartending too). I ordered the burrito al Pastor with rice. It was amazing! The burrito was spicy but the meat was very flavorful & the burrito wasn't over loaded with extras. The rice was unique with cilantro & pineapple. My wife ordered mushroom quesadilla & that too was very flavorful! The cheese used was very rich! The price was just right too! Can't wait to stop back!
