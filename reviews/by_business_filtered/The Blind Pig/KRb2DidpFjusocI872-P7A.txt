Nice patio next to a fountain with plenty of shade. Ceviche is so salty it stings and is served traditional shrimp cocktail style-floating in a bowl of tomato juice. The chicken tacos were like street meat with gristle n all thrown in. Red sauce flavorful and spicy. Tomatillo sauce reminiscent of pesto. The fabulously creamy coconut sorbet almost rescued the whole meal but not quite. Service was friendly and mostly attentive but I would not eat here again.
