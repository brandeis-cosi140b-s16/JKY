We planned to go to The Mission but they were closed for renovations. THANK GOODNESS!!! Oh the GOODNESS!!! Friendly and prompt service. My water glass was never empty. We started with the Gauc, salsa and chips. There was lime in the guacamole which was fine and tomato but they leave chunks of avocado so it doesn't seem to runny. I had the Shrimp/Tamale. Fantastic!! The sauce is light not thick and heavy. Delicious! My husband really enjoyed the Torta Ahogada. He talked about that sandwich all night. If we are in the area again this will be our first choice!!
