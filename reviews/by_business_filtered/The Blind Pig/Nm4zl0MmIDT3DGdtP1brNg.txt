Found this place on Yelp because we were looking for a place to eat in the area.  We were hungry and ordered too much food.  We stared off with the queso fundido and guacamole and chips.  Yes, the menu said the queso fundido had beans but it wasn't what we were expecting.  Too much beans and not enough cheese!  The guacamole was delicious.  Our meals were the Pambazo "house special" sandwich and the torta.  The house special sandwich was very good and the better of the two.  The torta had too much bread.  Overall, not authentic Mexican food and I guess not what we were wanting, hence the three stars.
