I love the idea of this place and expected to get great pork dishes but alas, it's really a Mexican restaurant.  Only one pork dish on the menu.  

Food was fine.  Nothing special.  I also took home $50 worth of meat from the meat counter in the restaurant and it was fine, but again, nothing special.  I thought the sausages were pretty bland and tasteless.

I don't plan to go back, not because it was bad but because there are lots of better places.
