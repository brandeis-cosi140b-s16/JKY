This place was pretty awesome. Everything we ordered tasted great and the prices was all reasonable. The $$ is deceiving because its not that pricy. I got the Adobo Braised Short Ribs with house rice (+$1.00). The short ribs dish was only $10. It was so flavorful, both with a slight sweetness and spiciness. It was the perfect balance. Additionally, the short rib was tender but not overly tender that it falls apart. 

My husband got the carnitas house sandwich. The cold slaw in the sandwich didn't drown out the carnitas. It complimented it perfectly. The carnitas was the center of attention. 

As a starter, we got the cerviche. It's hard to get it wrong. The shrimp was fresh and the larger type. There was just a hint of spiciness. 

Love this place. Too bad I'm from out of state, otherwise I'll be coming here all the time.
