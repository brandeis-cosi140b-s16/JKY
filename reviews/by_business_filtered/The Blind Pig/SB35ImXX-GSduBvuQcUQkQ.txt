Hole in the wall unassuming strip mall jewel in the rough.  In town for business and found this place based on online reviews.  I'm  always on the lookout for good honest delicious unpretentious food (and I am a card carrying member of foodie nation) and the food was delicious!  Waitress was friendly beyond belief and made you feel like a regular which judging by the number of regs made this place homey.  Raul the bartender makes a mean undiluted margarita. Recommended to have shrimp tamales and did not disappoint.  Can't say enough about this place,
