After biting into my pork sandwich I was greeted by a gnarly hunk of BONE; I let the my waitress know. her response was not sympathetic and she shrugged it off by letting me know that it happens frequently and in a variety of their meats. Their guacamole was great, but the rest of the food was lackluster and missed the target.
