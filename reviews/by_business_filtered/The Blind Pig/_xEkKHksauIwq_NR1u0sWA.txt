I love this place. The best tacos ever. Just had the butcher grind me a half  and half of bacon and ground beef. Forget Jack in the Box, this is the true Bacon Insider. Mandy is amazing, she treated me with great kindness the instant I walked in the door. Quinn was so kind to grind that bacon and beef for me.
