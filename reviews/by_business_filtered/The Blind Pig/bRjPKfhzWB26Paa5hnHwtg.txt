Mmmmmm... This is definitely a great place to go and a hidden gem. With it being so tucked away in a dark corner of a strip mall and kind of in the shadow of Uncle Sal's, I suppose it can easily go overlooked but do yourself a favor and check this place out!

I've been here multiple times and almost every single time I've tried something different and enjoyed it all. 

Lunch for two - Around $30 and WELL worth it. I will continue to back again and again...
