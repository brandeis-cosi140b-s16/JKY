Fantastic! Ordered the chips and salsa ($4) and was not disappointed. Chips were light and crisp; both salsas were delicious. Mahi tacos ($8) were phenomenal and the portion size was impressive, especially for the low price. Small grilled cubes of fish were juicy but not greasy and so flavorful I didn't even add any of the sauce that came on the side.  The mahi was balanced with crunchy cabbage, but I nixed the red onion, which I think would have overpowered the other flavors. 

The food came out in record time and service was impeccable. My only disappointment was that they have 20oz bottles of soda rather than fountain soda.
