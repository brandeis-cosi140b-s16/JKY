This place is cool for several reasons- great food, casual environment, stiff drinks, friendly service, and my favorite part- the butcher on hand with awesome meats from a local ranch. 

Favorite things on the menu- pig wings, short ribs, pork chop mole, and all their tacos. At the end of the day all their food is great, only thing I would request is a few more options for sides.

But the best part is the quality of beef the butcher has, good pork and sausage selection too. I am telling you this meat is god damn good, as a man this may sound weird but I can't wait for the next chance I get to put their meat in my mouth.
