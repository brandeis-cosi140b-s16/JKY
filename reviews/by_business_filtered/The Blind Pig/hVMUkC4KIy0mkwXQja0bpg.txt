The only thing that sucks about The Blind Pig is that it's so far away from my house now!  I used to live right across the street from and would come here at least twice a month.  Thank goodness they are now on DoorDash!

MUST GET:
1. Their taco combos.  My favorite meats are the al pastor and short rib.
2. Their house rice with pineapple and chorizo - best. rice. ever. and this is coming from a professional rice eater (Asian).
3. Recently tried this, don't know why I didn't do it sooner - their short rib entree.  YUM.  Mix the rice with the sauce and you've got one of the best combos out there.

Best part about this place is the price.  I ordered tacos for five people and spent $50.  They used to be a butcher, so the meat is top notch.  

If you want some great Mexican food that's not heavy and full of beans, COME HERE!  You won't regret it :)
