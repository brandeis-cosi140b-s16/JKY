Love this place. I have ordered take out several times with co-workers and each time we all rave about how much we love the place and think that the portions are a great value. I typically order the chicken nachos - they are amazing - huge portion...so huge, they are served in a pizza box. I can't ever eat more than half of the order and it was only $8 - seriously, great deal. I have had samplings of others food and have been equally as impressed with other dishes from the menu. I have picked up the order a couple of times and have found that the service is always friends and efficient. Even more impressive - the order has always been right. They are willing to split the bill among multiple payment sources (credit cards, cash etc.) I have nothing but positive things to say about this place and will continue to return regularly.
