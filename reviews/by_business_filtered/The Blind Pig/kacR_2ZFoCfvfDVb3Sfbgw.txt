Oh my gosh. I will be back here next week. Maybe even tomorrow. My family of four came to eat dinner here. First impression is it is quaint and contains Kobe beef meat shop inside (yummm). We chose to sit outside because it was nice out. There is a water fixture that adds to the ambiance. Our waiter was super nice and the food came so fast. We ordered some chips with salsa and guac. Great chunks of avocado and the salsa was addicting (the green was had a nice kick to it). I ordered the combo of two tacos and a side of beans or rice. I chose the al pastor and the el pollo and a side of beans. I don't even know where to begin! The chicken taco had great flavor but the al pastor was to die for. It was perfectly cooked with complimentary toppings like pineapple that just burst with flavor. The beans were probably the best flavored refried beans I have ever had and it was a large portion! With the four of us having full meals and an appetizer we only spent 42 dollars. What a great place! I will be back very soon :)
