Came here for the first time on a Saturday night around 7pm for dinner.

Food
-Starter: Bruchetta. Great flavor, huge chunks off tomato and avocado.
-Entree: tacos; pollo, carne, short rib. Very disappointing.. dry, lacking flavor, barely any meat.
-Entree: short ribs over (house) rice. House rice worth the upcharge, meat was tender and yummy.

Service
Slooooow. And just generally not good. Two servers to cover both the bar and dining area. Granted the place is small, but every table was filled, so they were busy.. but that meant we never saw our server... except for when we left and saw her texting up a storm outside.

I'd give it one more try because some of the food was good, but overall, I am completely unimpressed.
