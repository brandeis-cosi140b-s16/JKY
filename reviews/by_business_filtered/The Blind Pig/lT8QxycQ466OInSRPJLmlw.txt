I can't believe I am just now writing a review for this place as it has been a staple in our diet for the last two years. We love The Blind Pig as the food is always delicious and really affordable. 

It's not your typical Mexican restaurant as everything is really fresh and never greasy. The staff is great as well and always remember us. I highly recommend the short rib tacos with green salsa, ceviche, shrimp tamale and mushroom quesadilla. They have enchiladas on special sometimes and are always amazing. Not to mention they have top shelf margaritas and Paloma's for $7 all the time. 

It is a must try.
