Such a great place!  First off the meat counter is impressive...nice looking meats and not overly priced.  The patio is beautiful...next to a nice fountain and heat lamps for when it gets cool.  We heard the patio was pet friendly, but really it isn't...we had to keep our pup outside of the fence of the patio...luckily, it was right next to where we were sitting, so it was as if she was on the patio with us.  

The food was amazingly reasonable and super tasty!  We tried the carne asada burrito with house rice, the carne asada and al pastor tacos with house rice and we shared a side of the ridiculously tasty butcher beans...you must try these - trust me, you will understand once you taste how delicious they are!
