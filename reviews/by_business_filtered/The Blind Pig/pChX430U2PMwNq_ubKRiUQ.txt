Get the nachos. Please. Unless you're allergic to nachos, get the nachos. They are to die for. When my sister and I went there, we ate the nachos for our dinner, basically. And I am not even a fan of cheese. Amazing. 
The service is great, and the food is delicious. The prices are pretty low as well. The location is sort of hidden, but it's not a problem.
