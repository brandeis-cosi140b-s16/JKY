Yelped this location for lunch and glad we did.  Really good food here.  We had the chips and salsa with guacamole.  There is an up charge for this, versus most places which just drop off bottomless chips and salsa, but the guacamole was handmade and so are the salsas.  Good stuff and for $6, not complaining too loud, as guacamole is always extra no matter where you go - chips were refilled at no charge.  I prefer them fresh and hot...these were maybe out of bag, but they were decent.  I did the pick any two taco combo.  I am a real fan of the crispy taco...these were okay, but not the best I've had.  The real find was the Short Rib Tacos - man oh man...I wish I had two of these - they were that good.  They have a few other specialities, but you won't be disappointed if you order one of these.  The choice was rice or beans.  I picked the rice and it was also tasty, with a hint of pineapple and some other goodies mixed in.  We used the rest of the $6 salsa on top of the rice.  Service was promote and efficient.  I would eat here again.
