First time eating here last night. Food was just "ok" and our service was soooo terrible. We waited over an hour to get our food. They were also out of sour cream. How can you be out of sour cream at a Mexican restaurant?! We were also asked if we saved room for dessert--we hadn't even gotten our dinner yet. Big bummer because we were looking forward to eating here after reading other reviews.
