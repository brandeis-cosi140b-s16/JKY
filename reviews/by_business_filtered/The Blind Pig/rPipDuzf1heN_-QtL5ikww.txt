This place was pretty good. I had the shrimp tamale, which I was glad it wasn't so dry  as they usually are with the nice sauce over top, almost too saucy though. The shrimp was very good though. My boyfriend had the burrito which he thought was pretty good also. I would say I have had better Mexican elsewhere, but this place was fairly similar to any other Mexican restaurant you might eat at. Maybe we weren't there at the right time since we ate here late on a week night.
