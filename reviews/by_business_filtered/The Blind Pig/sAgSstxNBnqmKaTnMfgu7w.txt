Menu can be a little limited; not your average mexican style cuisine. It provides a unique twist on the genre. For avocado lovers, the avocado bruschetta is too die for with fresh avocado mixed with Pico de Gallo and Sriracha for a little spice on toasted bread. For my entree I seem to always gravitate towards the shrimp ceviche. My husband either gets the nachos with chicken (massive portion) or the drunken sandwich. Definitely worth checking out!
