Whooooaaa baby I love The Blind Pig. How this local gem is not busier than I normally see it totally blows my mind. A butcher shop (Hobe Meats) and cafe (concept from the owners of Uncle Sal's and Side Door Corner Store) that serves up some tasty food, has pretty darn good service, and very good prices. Can't hate on that.

They've got a nice little assortment of tables inside and a great patio outside. Granted they could probably do more with it from a decor and lighting standpoint, but maybe that's what they're going for, who knows.

What I do know is that the tacos here are fantastic - al Pastor are my favorite and they kick you in the mouth with a good amount of spice that keeps the drink refills coming. The must have for me and the girl every time we come is the Avocado Bruschetta - don't second guess it on simplicity, just eat it and be happy.

The butcher shop here is great and I've picked up quite a few things like their bacon, NY Strip Steaks, and beer brats. They basically have every kind of meat you would need to put on a high quality barbecue for you and your friends.

Come support a great local restaurant and meat purveyor, you wont be disappointed.
