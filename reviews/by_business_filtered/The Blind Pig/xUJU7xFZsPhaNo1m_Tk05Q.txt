Once upon a time, you could walk into Uncle Sal's on a Friday night with no reservations and be seated immediately. (Holy crap - has it really been 20 years since I lived in the area?!?!)
Those days are long gone. Dinner was on me for coordinating - and I dropped the ball.

Luckily, the Blind Pig was right next door, and we 4 hungry patrons could be seated and served right away.

We shared a couple plated for the table, and nibbled each other's entrees. The steak salad was a winner. The short rib was well cooked and flavorful. And everything else was perfectly OK. I had a trio of tacos  - none of which really stood out. Nothing wrong with them. Fresh, flavorful, well executed. I am just spoiled by other places in my current 'hood.

If I am in the area, and someone suggests the Blind Pig, I won't object. 
I also don't think I'd plan another meal there. Nothing in the world wrong with the place - just no "wow" factor for me.
