is is the best burrito place in Charlotte I've been to so far. It's the only place around i know of where i can get a California Wet Burrito. You can't find these things too many places outside of southern California.

The salsas are excellent!  

As someone who has tried many burrito places in San Diego, and recently moved to Charlotte, I highly recommend this place!
