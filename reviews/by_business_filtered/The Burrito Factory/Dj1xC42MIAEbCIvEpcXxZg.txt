I'm from San Diego and have been in Charlotte for 5 years now. Burrito Factory is the first place I've found in Charlotte that does California's version of Mexican food justice. California burritos (the ones with french fries inside), fish tacos, shrimp burritos. It's spectacular. 

This place is every bit the small, delicious taco shop that one sees on every corner in Southern California. And Sam the owner is awesome. We can't wait to come back - this place is going to be a regular stop for us!
