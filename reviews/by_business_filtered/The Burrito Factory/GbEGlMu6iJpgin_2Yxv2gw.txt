We HAD to check this place out after we saw the amazing reviews. We all loved everything!!  Burritos, tacos.....  And the salsa bar!!?!  Perfect. I love the variety of drinks. My kids LOVE the horchata!!  The people that were working there were very kind, and offered fantastic suggestions. The whole place was really clean, and we enjoyed the atmosphere. We will definitely be back.
