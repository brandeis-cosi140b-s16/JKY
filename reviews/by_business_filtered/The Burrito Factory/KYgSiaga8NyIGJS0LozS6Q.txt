My second time here was just as good as my first. Owner is super friendly and staff is very nice. The best thing about the food is the freshness. They definitely use fresh ingredients and you can taste the difference. The salsa bar is a must try here as we'll. This is a go to spot for lunch and bring an appetite because you won't leave hungry.
