Had the pleasure of eating my first Shrimp Burrito at the Burrito Factory (BF) - incredible!

As a recent transplant from Arizona, I've been on the search for GREAT Mexican flavors, and the Burrito Factory has it.  The chicken and steak are very good, and the shrimp is cooked to order in a wonderful chipotle sauce.  Featured are the typical fillers of a Quoda and Chipotle - black/pinto beans, rice, pico, guacamole - but BF takes it to a whole-nother level with 2 choices of fresh cheese, fresh chopped cilantro and jalapenos, and other sides you won't find at the chain restaurants.  To compare with other very good fresh burrito/Mexican flavors in town (Phat Burrito and Cabo Fish Taco), BF sets itself apart with a well-balanced mix of authentic Mexican spices/flavors.  To top it off, you get a generous portion of homemade corn tortilla chips and access to a FREE homemade salsa bar.  The salsas attest to the skill and authenticity of the staff, showcasing a wonderful bouquet of roasted peppers, onions, and spices.

The inside decor is every bit as clean and sleek as a Chipotle with the simple casualness of a real California-Style burrito joint.  Also, the staff is friendly and helpful.

BF gets a 4 out of 5 for excellently prepared food, great flavors, and a level of authenticity that simply can't be found in other fast-food burrito joints in town.  If you have an adventurous palate or are looking to experience true Mexican flavors, the Burrito Factory is a must eat in Charlotte!
