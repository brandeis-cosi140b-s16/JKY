I decided to try this place on taco Tuesday since the tacos are only 1.00!!! I ordered two vegetarian tacos. The tacos were absolutely delicious they came on corn tortillas with your choices of beans and toppings!!! I also love this place because it is vegetarian friendly if you don't want meat you can get tofu which is a huge plus. You also get chips with access to the salsa bar. The chips provided to me were not so good they tasted over fried and oily the salsa bar was good though because it allows you the option to try a variety of salsas. I'm happy to say that I found a great place to grab Tacos on Tuesdays!!!!
