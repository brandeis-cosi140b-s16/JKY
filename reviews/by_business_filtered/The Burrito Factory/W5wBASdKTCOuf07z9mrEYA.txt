THANK GOD FOR BURRITO FACTORY.

I was beginning to get worried about the burrito scene in Charlotte. if you like a giant (and i mean HUGE) California style burrito, this is exactly 100% without a smidgen of a doubt where you need to go get your fix. 

The staff is always friendly to everyone that walks in the door, and fast at what they do as well. All of the veggies are fresh and colorful, and they offer some unique options that other burrito spots do not; like banana peppers and these delicious pickled red onions that add a nice little sweet bite to your meal.

 The menu offers more than just your average burrito, too. My advice: try the curry chicken, pork, and wet California burritos- ypu won't be disappointed there. Also make sure you make it out for Taco Tuesday, where you can grab pork, chicken, or ground beef tacos for 99 cents a piece. 

Oh yeah, don't miss out on the salsa bar. Everything is made in house, and the guajadillo and tomatillo salsas come highly recommended. I love this place, as it's become a go-to for me and my friends!!
