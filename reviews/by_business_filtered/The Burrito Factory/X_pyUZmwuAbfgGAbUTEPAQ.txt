I've had a lot of burritos in my day, and this one was exceptional. In fact, the best I've had east of the Mississippi. The employees here as a bonus were fantastic. They filled me in on everything and thanked me for coming in. I stumbled upon this place and soon realized they served the burrito of my dreams. A traditional California burrito with French fries mixed in. It sounds weird, but this is authentic SoCal style. 

The two gentleman in front of me spoke no English and I saw upon entering they serve horchata. Instant legit authentic burrito joint points awarded. The interior was clean and had ample space. The hot sauce station offered a little bit of everything. Even the chips served free w/ the meal were refreshingly crisp and delicious. I could find no wrong with the Burrito Factory. What a knockout meal!
