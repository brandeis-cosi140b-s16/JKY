With all of the previous raves, I'm thinking that I must have visited on an 'off' night. I was in the area a couple of weeks ago and thanks to my yelp app, I saw that BF was literally a hop, skip and jump from my location. I went in and noticed that the place was empty which may have had something to do with the fact that they had a sign posted on the door stating their A/C was down (mind you, this was during one of our heat wave weeks). I looked at the menu really quickly and decided to go with the juicy chicken burrito.

What I immediately found odd was that I couldn't see any of the ingredients. I had to rely on the list that was posted on the plexi glass in front. Maybe they were keeping the ingredients covered due to the inside conditions (no A/C and all) but I was really turned off by that. I like to be able to see what I'm choosing! The guy who was working behind the counter was very friendly and made sure that I was aware of all my meal and sides options.

However, I wasn't all that satisfied with the taste of the burrito. I couldn't place the whether the 'different' taste I experienced was in the tortilla or rice but I was not a fan. I am more than willing to give this place another try and will probably stick with the tacos on my next go-round.
