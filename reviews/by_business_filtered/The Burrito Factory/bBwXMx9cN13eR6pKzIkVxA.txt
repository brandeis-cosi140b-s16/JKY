We liked the food and the people. 

We couldn't find the napkins which is hidden off to the side of the restaurant. Odd. 

We enjoyed the pork burrito and veggie burrito.  I really liked that they cooked the zucchini and squash fresh in front of me. They had a variety of salsa to choose from. 

We also enjoyed the like and mandarin natural sodas. The lime was better than mandarin.
