Oh, how I wish Chip Nutty had worked out (http://www.yelp.com/biz/chip-nutty-cookies-charlotte), but alas, it wasn't in the cards. Instead we get The Burrito Factory. I usually select local, one-store, type businesses over the chain ones for two reasons, to support local business and because they are usually fresher, better and made with more love than those chain factories.

Unfortunately, The Burrito Factory didn't have that local feeling I was looking for. Now, their food is NOT bad by any stretch of the imagination. But there really wasn't any real flavor or soul to speak of. My burrito was very bland despite the fact that I added nearly everything they had to offer. My mother ordered a couple of tamales and they literally just plop two tamales on a place and put some weird cheese-base sauce over them. Nothing else... That's not how you serve tamales.

The day we went they had a local Latin radio station truck outside, which is how we noticed the place and decided to stop. Unfortunately, aside from what looked like an excessive number of servers and what I think was one of the owners and his buddies, there was nobody there but us. 

Their menu is simple and has some good offers. One of the cool features is their salsa bar, which has some very unique salsas you usually don't see anywhere else.

Not a bad place to eat, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.
