Meh.

I was excited to try this place but came away disappointed. I had the California Wet Burrito and found it to be on the bland side. Service was quick, burritos were huge and well-made, I just wasn't feeling the flavors. For what it's worth, my fiance enjoyed his burrito.

With all the rave reviews, I'll probably give this place another shot someday.
