WOW!  That's all I can say about this place!  Authentic and good.  Great fillings and fresh meats.  I loved Moes but graduated to Chipotle and thought it was the pinnacle peak as far as burritos go.  But I got a wild hair and decided to look for more burrito spots.  I came across this place based off it's solid reviews.  I drove 25 minutes just to get take out from here.  Solid sauces, solid chips, GREAT BURRITOS!  Give it a try!!!
