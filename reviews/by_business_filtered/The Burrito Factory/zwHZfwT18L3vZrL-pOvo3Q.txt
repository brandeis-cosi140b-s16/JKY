The food here is delicious! Always on the lookout for a good shrimp burrito my partner suggested we stop here before heading back to Atlanta. We both grew up in the West/Southwest and know what Mexican food should taste like. 

She loved her shrimp burrito! She was still talking about it when we drove away. The secret ingredient seems to be their yummy chipotle sauce.

 I'm a vegetarian so I was glad they had the tofu burrito. The rice in my burrito was perfect! It took me back to the days when I would sit at my neighbor's table and she would say "Here mijita, have some rice". Like home cookin. Yum!

Also, the creamy red salsa and creamy green salsa are on point! 

I had one of those Jarrito (pineapple) sodas I used to love way back when and I was in heaven. Our meals were tasty and filling at a fair price.  

The restaurant was humble but clean (the women's restroom was tidy). The service was excellent. It's clear that they take pride in their food.  

I highly recommend this place.
