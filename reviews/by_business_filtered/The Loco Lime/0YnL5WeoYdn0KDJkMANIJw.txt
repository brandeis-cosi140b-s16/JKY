The first thing that stands out in my mind is the staff.  Whether they are waiting on you or just happening to be walking past, they smile at you and greet you, often asking if you need anything.  That is impressive.
What is not impressive is the food.  The complimentary salsa is lackluster, tasting like glorified tomato sauce.  I ordered the cheese enchiladas, which came with retried beans and rice.  It was as if they were not cooked long enough for the cheese to melt.  As we all know, the hallmark of American Mexican food is that pool of melted cheese.  The cheese in these enchiladas was solid and chewy.  Refried beans and rice were decent.  Husband got the fish tacos, and he deemed them "ok."
Now, if the food was as charismatic as the staff, I would return again and again!
