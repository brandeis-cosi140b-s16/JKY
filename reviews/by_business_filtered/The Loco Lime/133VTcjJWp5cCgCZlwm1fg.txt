I was really on the fence between three and four stars, but what the hell, four stars it is, all thanks to the guy who came up to us at the end of our dinner.

We went on "all you can eat taco night (as long as you cannot eat more than ten tacos)."  I thought is was pretty good.  They've got the normal filling choices you would expect at a taqueria (except tongue), and the tacos are finished off with the classic onion, cilantro, and queso fresco.  They also give you a little cup of this dynamite salsa.  The refried beans on the side were pretty good, but the rice was dry.

My wife did not really like the tacos as much as I did, for some reason.

Throughout the meal, service was very friendly and attentive.  It was also Tecate Beer special night, and they had it by the bottle, which was great.  I got one of those.

Then, right when we were about to leave, this waiter we hadn't seen came up and said, "your Tecate, sir."  I said, "I didn't order another Tecate, or are you just being friendly?"  He looked around, said "happy all you can eat taco night!" and left me the bottle.  A nice little complimentary capper on a good meal.
