What's not to love about a crazy lime? I've been here twice and must say that this place has just been elevated to my most favorite Mexican spot for something casual, quick and divine.  I think the fact that my last visit was a Tuesday night and it was so jam packed you would have thought it was Friday or Saturday....then again it was $1.00 Taco Night.  Which brings me to the next reason I like this place, the daily meal/drink specials.  I think it's a pretty static daily special so memorize it and visit it on whatever day suits you best!

I had the grilled chicken taco salad and everything was fresh and the portion was more than enough!  Service was quick and polite.

Sidenote: We all know most Mexican restaurants provide chips before your meal but most also provide a very watered down salsa to use.  Not this place.  They have the absolute best salsa in my opinion.
