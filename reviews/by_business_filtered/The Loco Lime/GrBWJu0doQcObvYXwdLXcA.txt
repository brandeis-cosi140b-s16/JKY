I was very disappointed with the service and food at this Central Avenue location. 

Here are some good and bad highlights of my Saturday night visit:

-I immediately noticed the nice décor and overall setup of the restaurant. The concept is simple yet cute and comfortable. 

-We were greeted by a warm smiling hostess who suggested a drink which was excellent. 

-Our server wasn't well versed on the menu nor did she attempt to seek any help to answer questions. Instead she snapped her fingers followed with a couple "um's" and a laugh. 

-The queso that we added to pair with the salsa and chips was rather bland. It reminded me of something out of a jar in the supermarket. 

-I ordered the Veggie Tacos which, according to the menu and online menu, it should come with sautéed Portobello mushrooms, roasted corn relish, sweet plantains, and grilled zucchini toped with queso fresco. Mouth watering right? However, I received two tacos with zucchini, two strips of mushrooms, and cheese on top. The server never came back to see how our food was, so luckily the manager passed by and I told her some things were missing. She proceeded to cross her arms then point at the tacos while asking "what is missing?" I was surprised by both her body language and tone. After telling her what was missing she said that what I received is what comes on the Veggie Tacos. I didn't feel the need to persist, so I told her it was fine. 

-The server came by about 10 minutes later to ask was everything fine. Before asking for the checks, I told her that I thought the service and food would be better and she responded "yeah" and smiled. 

-I understand that sometimes people have a bad day, but the entire short lived experience was unacceptable. 

-I will not be returning to this restaurant or recommending it for anyone who wants Mexican cuisine, but I wish them the best of luck with improvements!
