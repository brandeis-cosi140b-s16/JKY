At least I have something to compare Mexican meals to as this was the worst mexican meal I've ever had. Ordered a basic dish: beef enchiladas. Tasted like salt with a side of enchiladas, rice, and beans. Not fresh, plasticky and too salty, I barely had a few bites. Even the salsa at this place was overly salty and had too much garlic. The dish aside, the server was genuinely concerned that I didn't eat anything and promised to alert the kitchen. Although we promised to go back for another try, we lied. There are way better options in the QC!
