I am sad to report that Loco Lime is edging itself off of my list of favorite places to eat. 1/2 price margaritas have now become $2 off margaritas - still not a bad deal, but com'mon! 

Business is picking up, which is GREAT for them! On the down side, though, it doesn't seem like they anticipated this because the service has suffered during our last few visits (we are usually in 2-3 times a month). There is one server in particular that we hope we don't get every time we go. To make up for this sever, which we almost always get stuck with no matter how much we pray, is one of the (or maybe "The") manager(s). He is always running around delivering food, busing tables, greeting people at the door, refilling drinks and then will stop and make sure your food is perfect once it's at your table. Cheers to you, good sir! 

Food quality has not faltered - but please, please, please get some more people ... strike that, more FRIENDLY people ... on your staff.
