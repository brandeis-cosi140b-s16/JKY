Both times my boyfriend and I have eaten here, we have really enjoyed the food and they definitely give you plenty of it.  I've eaten their Arroz Con Pollo (cheesy and delicious) and the barbacoa authentic mexican tacos.  The chicken dish was great!  Perfectly cooked rice, shredded chicken, peas, and tons of cheese.  Yum!  The tacos were okay, but I wouldn't order the barbacoa again if given the choice.  The meat was pretty greasy and when I picked up my taco to eat it, the bottom kinda fell apart into a greasy pile.  Not so great.  The best thing I have eaten here is by far the tostada appetizer.  It's listed on the app menu, but the portion is definitely enough for a meal.  We had them made with carnitas and they were soooooo good!  Chopped pork, honey cumin cilantro slaw, veggies galore, all ready to put on top of a crispy corn tortilla round.  Very good and probably what I will order next time.  Their menu consists of all the usual Mexican faves, with several veggie items too.  The food is slightly overpriced, but I feel like they make up for it in portion size.
