Dinner tonight was decent.  I've actually been quite a few times to the Lime and it has never disappointed.  Great place for a small dinner or a big group of mexican lovers.  They even have a vegetarian specific menu, so for the veggie lovers or the true meat haters, you can enjoy a chimachanga or other common delight!  I usually get the plantain veggiechanga,  and I like it mucho!  All the meals tonight were done well with no complaints from the table!  I definitely recommend it highly!
The service this past time was not very attentive and we had to wait for quite awhile for our check.  Other than that, I got nothing! Enjoy, Yelpers!
