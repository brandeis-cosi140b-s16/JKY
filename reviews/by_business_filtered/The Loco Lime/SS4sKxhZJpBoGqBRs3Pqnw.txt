I had a coupon for Buy 1 entree, get one free so I figured this place was worth a try, it exceeded all my expectations!

We went this past Friday night at about 7:30,  we were seated right away and given chips and delicious salsa immediately.  I told our waiter about the coupon and he gladly took it to be used later.

My husband ordered a margarita and I tried some, it was decent.  We each ordered a combo plate, I chose a cheese enchilada and a asada tostada.  I was impressed you could choose from all different meats, not just beef or chicken.  He got a chimichanga with asada and a chicken enchilada.  You can also choose your sauce, green chile, traditional red sauce,or queso sauce.  I chose red and he chose queso and both were equally delicious.

My tostada was the best I've ever had, somehow there was hardboiled eggs and what seemed like coleslaw on in addition to cheese, meat, and refried beans.  The platters we ordered were served with rice and beans both were very good and you got sour cream and guac on your plate as well.  I appreciate there was no extra charge!

Overall it was a wonderful mexican meal and I will be back soon and totally willing to pay full price for it!
