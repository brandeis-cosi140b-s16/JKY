Are you Loco? Well of course your are if you don't go to locolime. Who can pass up a $10 margarita pitcher and some Arroz con pollo. I went they were serving lunch and got the dish for a few dollars cheaper than the listed price. So already I'm in heaven because I just felt so special for scoring deals from the jump. Our waitress said this dish was a specialty dish and it was made fresh daily. I figured this was just another ploy to make me order it but hey she wasn't lying. The flavor this dish packed was amazing. I went and got the same dish from Applebee's and lets just say they couldn't stand a chance. The chips and Dip at this place is great as well. Usually I don't really pay attention to "snacks" because I am a whole meal type of guy but these things just brought you in with great salsa. Overall I would recommend Loco Lime to anyone that decides to visit the East side of Charlotte.
