Who doesn't like taco's? I certainly do... 

The good- Loco Lime has a good amount of variety when it comes to their tacos. I have tried three thus far. Chorizo, barbacoa, and the carne asade. All were bursting with lovely flavors and completely delicious.

The bad- completely Americanized and standardized menu. Everything on the plate other then the tacos was extremely bland. The salsa and queso were mediocre and did not stand out from the rest.
