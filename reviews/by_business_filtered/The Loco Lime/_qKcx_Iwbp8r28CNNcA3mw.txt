The food at Loco Lime is always amazing!

This is a restaurant I frequent time after time, and they never disappoint.  Although I've had many items on the menu, I have to say the tacos (any kind) are to die for!  All ingredients are so fresh!

I typically sit at the bar for a meal, and the service is amazing!    I would definitely recommend Loco Lime if ever interested in a cold Mexican Beer and fresh tacos, can't go wrong!
