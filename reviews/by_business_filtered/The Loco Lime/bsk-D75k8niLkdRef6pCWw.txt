I've been here a couple of times and I still don't get the hype. The food is decent but nothing special compared to any other Tex-Mex restaurants in Charlotte. Their tableside guacamole was good and they did make it very spicy like we asked. And their jalepeno margaritas are delicious. But their actual dishes are just whatever. 

One reason I'm knocking them down to two stars is their service. The first time I went, the girl seemed very irritated that we were in there so late (only an hour and a half before they closed. Geez). The second time, the guy kept acting like any request we made was a joke. "can we get the tableside guac?" "ha...sure. ....oh really?" i know it was kind of busy but we are very patient and very good tippers so we were serious. Then when I asked for a box for my quesadillas, I also asked for a side of sour cream and salsa. (to which he replied "to eat here? Hahah ok?" "no....for home" what a weird question) The box came out about 15 minutes later and was just thrown down as he was walking to the next table. I then had to ask for the sides again. We had already paid and everything and after another 15 minutes of nothing, we just left.

I want to give them one more chance as far as service goes bc it's the only neighborhood Mexican restaurant and I want to experience what everyone else has experienced. But I'm serious...one more chance..
