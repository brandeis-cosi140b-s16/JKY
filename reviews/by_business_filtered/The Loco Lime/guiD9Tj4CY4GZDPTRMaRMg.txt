After my latest trip here, i have to say we did not experience the poor service like some of the reviews i read before going. Alex took good care of our table, so no complaints there. They do have a vegetarian section and a few dishes can unofficially be turned vegan minus some cheese and sour cream. 
So i ordered the fajitas and while the menu doesn't list cheese, they do like to garnish the beans with cheese and there was even a side of cheese as fajita toppings. Even if it doesn't list cheese, and you don't want any, make sure to ask for no cheese. The other huge bummer was having a piece of chicken find it's way in the vegetarian fajita skillet. 
The table side guac was pretty tasty. Also, they do charge if you want jalapenos mixed in or a side of pickled onion.
