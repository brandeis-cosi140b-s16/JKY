I absolutely love this place! It has become our new Monday night place since it serves up 1/2 priced Margaritas. The Jalapeno Margarita is amazing ... and for those a bit braver, order it with their Tabasco tequila. The staff is very friendly and the service is fast. The second you think you're going to run out of chips & salsa, there's a fresh batch on your table without you having to ask. The dinners are great; I'm a big fan of the enchiladas!
