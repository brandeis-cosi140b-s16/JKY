I've been here twice and both times got the crab queso...It's simple but unbelievably delicious and decadent.  The queso is thick, creamy, and rich, and the addition of spiced lump crabmeat takes it over the top.  
For my entree the first time I ordered a veggie enchilada and got chicken - didn't bother sending it back as I was happy to try the chicken anyway.  It was topped with more of that insane queso, but that was really the only flavor that stood out.  The tortillas were somehow soggy and tough at the same time, and the chicken was woefully under-spiced.  
The next time I ordered the crab enchilada, which is basically the crab queso wrapped up with a drizzle of chipotle sauce on top.  Given that the crab queso is so delicious, this wasn't bad, but again the tortillas were weirdly soggy and tough.  
I'll definitely give this place another go around, but you can bet I'm not ordering the enchiladas again!  The queso is enough to get me in the door, and half priced margaritas on tuesdays doesn't hurt, either.
