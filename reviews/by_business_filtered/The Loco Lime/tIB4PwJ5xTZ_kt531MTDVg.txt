Loco Lime..I would have to be Loco to go back there..Not a favorite in my book. Starting out the place was freezing..no heat..Hard to be excited about drinking a ice cold Jalapeno Margarita ( which was the best thing I had all night) in the cold. Chips and Salsa were average...the hottest salsa was not hot-even though we were warned about it. Ordered the Fried Jalapenos...pretty good..hot when served ..ranch dip does not go with it...Then I ordered the Chile Rellenos I order them all over - always looking for the ultimate one. I ask for the Ranchero Sauce on the side to make sure I dont get a limp Relleno..well Limp it was..both of them..yes ..Piggie here ordered two..thats what I get..both in a limp pancake like batter that was not appealing at all. the filling was not Chihuahua cheese - - it was the cheese sauce from the queso. My plate was overwhelmed with a ? Coleslaw? it was in a sweet honey dressing but had Parmesan cheese on the top..what kind of mexican place uses parm?? The coleslaw sat on a bed of fried (yesterday) plantains...soggy and stale tasting. The beans and rice were plain and untasty. Not a cheap menu and not a menu I will be looking at again.
