Eh, I don't really like this spot. Great location and all that, but the food wasn't anything to write home about. 
I've noticed other reviewers really liked the veg options, & maybe that's where I went wrong? I suppose I'll have to go back and try something else(or send in a clone). I had a burrito with asada & the meat tasted old--never a good thing, but if they're pushing vegetarian items, it makes sense....I guess..My friend had flautas, it's never good to mess with someone's flautas!! C'mon son! Maybe we went on a bad day?  Yo no se, but I'd go to Taco Bell before I go there to eat again. The chips and salsa should NOT be the best thing I eat.
