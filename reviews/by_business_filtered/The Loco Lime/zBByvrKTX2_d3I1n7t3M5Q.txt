The Loco Lime is not very loco or very lime.  It is an amazing space, it has an industrial feel, outdoor seating, chips and salsa and tequila.  What more could you want?  The downside, it kind of had a corporate vibe.  We were told to try the jalapeno margarita, we did.   It was good, but nothing to sing about.  We ordered a chicken sandwich to start, we shared that and didn't want to order anything else.  Meh, I've experienced better, it was fine. I would go back, but not anytime too soon.
