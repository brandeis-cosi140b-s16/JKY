Drop in for taco Tuesday... $1 for a taco, count me in!  I'll be honest... It took me a few minutes to find the front door which is not on central ave. but once I walked around to the front I was pleasantly surprised to find a great outdoor spot with table chairs and of course bagg-o boards.  

We sat in the bar area and order a few tacos and a round of dos equis, which was a given after being stared down by the large portrait of the most interesting man in the world.  

The salsa was great, fresh and homemade.  The tacos were a great deal and even though they were small they were filling.  I was impressed that they were able to customize my tacos to my specifications.  I will definitely be back for more from this crazy lime.
