Great little latin place..

The pozole is excellent, highly recommend it, as is the table-side made guacamole (even though that's a little gimmicky and it took forever to get). 

The flat iron was very well cooked and really flavorful, paired perfectly with the charred leaks and little tomatilla salad but the portion was very small.

I'd come back if I'm in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.
