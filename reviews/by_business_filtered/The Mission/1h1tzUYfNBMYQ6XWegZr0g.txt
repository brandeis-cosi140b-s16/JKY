I dined here for the first time, while on vacation, because of all the good Yelp reviews. 

The atmosphere is tranquil looking but loud with a mixed aged-crowd.
It is apparently customary to be given a small light to look over the menu, because it is so dark . Our server did not offer us one , even after she saw me using my phone. 
Being our first time, (and we even told her it was our first time) she did not run through any specials or anything. I had to ask and she just told me the Chef's recommendation.  The server next to us told his table all the specials that evening.
The guacamole was different with the toasted pepitas in it. It had a nice flavor.
I had the chicken tacos and ordered flour tortillas vs corn. It would have been nice to have been told that I would have had to put everything together myself, vs if I had ordered them with corn tortillas. It came with two flour tortillas and a bowl with the chicken and avocado and then a side of the sauce. The chicken was  a tad dry and overcooked. I have had better tacos elsewhere.
The blood orange pineapple margarita was the best thing I had there. 
The server was not very inviting and seemed uninterested in helping us . She only came around to take the order and check how the guacamole was and then handed us our bill. 
I think there needs to be some improvement on the service.
I would try it again and ask for a different server.
