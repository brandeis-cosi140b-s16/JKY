Honestly a little disappointed with this place. The ambience was great and it was beautifully decorated. The staff was alright although we ordered an app and an entree and they all came out at once which was a little annoying. We got the table side guac which was good but I though over priced at 12 dollars when they used one avocado. We also got the pork shoulder tacos which 2 of us split. The pork was dry and lacked flavor and was certainly not worth the 34 dollars. I could have made much better ones at home.
