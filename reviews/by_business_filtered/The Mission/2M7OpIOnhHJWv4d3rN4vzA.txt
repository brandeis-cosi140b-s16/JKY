The official temperature yesterday at dinner time was a record breaking 115.  Unofficially on my cars temperature  gauge: 118.  Our reservations for the outdoor back patio were appearing a bit foolish.  Would dinner become a sweat bath of uncomfortableness?? Upon entering the covered back patio that is surrounded by shade trees and bushes, the item one first notices is a large outdoor cooling fan.  ( see the below picture) THANK god!  The dinner temp was warm but very comfortable and a real welcome break from sitting and eating indoors.  Living in Phoenix since 1999, you WILL be stir crazy every August because the monsoon limits any outdoor activities. 

The food, wow.... all the other Yelp reviews and pics are dead on.  We ordered the standard street corn "off the cob," the table side guacamole, and the fries.  For the main entrees, butternut tacos, Salmon, and the green onion duck were all full of flavor, delicate, had wonderful accompaniments, and quickly devoured by my hungry family. 

Will very highly recommend.
