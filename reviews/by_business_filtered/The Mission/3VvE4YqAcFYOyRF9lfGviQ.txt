Lousy..... I'm 63 years old. I'm used to needing my flashlight app to read the menu. I'm NOT used to needing the flashlight to see where to put the fork and the knife. Couldnt see the food. It was SO dark, and waitress and management didnt give a damn.  If you're young and romance is on your mind, then that's a different story. If you're there looking for a great meal, I'd go somewhere else.
Very Unhappy. & lost respect for concierge who sent us there.
