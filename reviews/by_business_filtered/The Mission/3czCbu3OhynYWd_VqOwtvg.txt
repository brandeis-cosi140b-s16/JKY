The food and drinks here are amazing! 5 stars for sure! I have to deduct a point for service though, the last 2 times we dined here, it seemed to take forever to get drinks, and the servers aren't very good at explaining dishes, nor are they personable. 

The cucumber Jalape√±o margorita is one of my favorite drinks around. 
We always start with the guacamole (make sure you order it spicy, its really not that hot) and it never fails us. For entrees, my gf always gets the tecate steak tacos and they are fantastic. last time i had the pork shoulder tacos for two, and wow, were they flavorful. love the street corn here too. I had one of the steak dishes once as well, and I can't say I was disappointed. It was cooked perfect, and full of flavor. 

This is one of our favorite restaurants for the time being, i just wish the service was a little better.
