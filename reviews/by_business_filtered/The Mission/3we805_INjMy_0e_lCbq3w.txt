Dined here for the first time on New Years Eve and I couldn't have asked for a more delicious meal.

We ordered:
1- Grilled Street Corn: SO delicious. A skewer of corn with butter, chile paprika and cotija. Its spicy and just the right amount of food for a starter. 
2- Guacamole: they make it for you right at your table! You can choose how spicy you want it and can tell your guac mixer to skip the onions. :)

And last but not least...
3- Roasted Organic Butternut squash Taco's: Spicy black bean sofrito, cumin, coriander+poblano, pickled jalapeno+cotija. These are easily the most delicious vegetarian taco's I have ever had. Delicious and again, not over board on the portions.

To drink? we ordered the Bitter Bee's. Hendricks gin, lime, basil, AZ honey and grapefruit. I could tell instantly how fresh the grapefruit juice was. If t wasn't squeezed you fooled me! 

We skipped dessert because with all this goodness we were pretty full. We made a reservation for two outside around 5:45pm and had zero issues getting seated as soon as we arrived. We sat at the back patio and while the atmosphere was dimly lit and beautiful for a cozy NYE meal, there was a funky smell coming from, what we guessed, their water fountain. Slowly we became desensitized to the smell and once the food was there, we didn't really notice much else going on around us. Service was great and I can't wait to go back there again.
