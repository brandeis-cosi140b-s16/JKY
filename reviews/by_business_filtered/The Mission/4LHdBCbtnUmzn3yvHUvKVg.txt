The meal at The Mission was AMAZING!  The only thing I regret is not having more room in my stomach to eat more.  

We started with the Grilled Street Corn and the Crispy Cola Pork.  Both were flavorful, unique, and worthy of being ordered again.  For my entree, I ordered the Sopa de Elote (I wasn't too hungry) and my husband ordered the Chorizo Porchetta.  True to the starters, these entrees were unlike anything we had tried before, and they left us wanting more.

We ended with the pumpkin bread pudding which can only be described as God's gift to bread pudding.  It was rich, decadent, and had me wanting to like the plate.  

This place is a must try!
