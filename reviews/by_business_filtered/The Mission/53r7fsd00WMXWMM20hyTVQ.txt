The food was amazing, the kind which makes you close your eyes & smile. I had the grilled chicken tacos with a side dish of papa's y chorizo then we tried huge tequila shots which I believe are a house special we were told it is DIAMOND filtered "OOOO fancy" whatever they do it was smooth! Warm and chilled (So we had a couple) haha. We were a party of 3 we all tried different dishes and all enjoyed.
