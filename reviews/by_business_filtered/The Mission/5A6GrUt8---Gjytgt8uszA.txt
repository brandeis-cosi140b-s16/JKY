This place for real has the best service I've ever had at any restaurant. When a restaurant has perfect service, it really adds to the whole overall experience. Everyone is so personable (and being at a fancy restaurant in Scottsdale, it's really hard to find a place where the staff is both friendly and respectful). The food here is excellent; the scallop tacos and Alaskan Halibut are some of my favorites along with the pumpkin bread pudding. Would give it 10 stars if I could!
