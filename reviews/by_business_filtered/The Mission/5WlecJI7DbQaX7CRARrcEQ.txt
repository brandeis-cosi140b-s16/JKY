I have not attended one of these events in the past, so I did not know what to expect, but I thought it was a terrific event/venue.

Impressive was that minutes after walking in the bar, we were offered free tastings of Tequila Sol de Mexico.  Very smooth, and in fact, refreshing, if drank when cold.  See this link for more information:  http://soldemexico.com.

I was so anxious that I might be the wallflower.  (Does everyone have that same anxiety?)  The people [Yelpers] were very open and relaxed.  Conversation flowed easily, and I felt comfortable almost immediately.  Of course, Gabi, is terrific about introducing Yelpers to one another.

Gabi [Yelp] was generous with beverages and food, and The Mission is simply beautiful with a great warmth to it.

Thanks, again, to Gabi and Yelp, and I look forward to another event!
