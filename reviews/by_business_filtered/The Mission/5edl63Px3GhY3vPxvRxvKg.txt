Awesome place. The food and am since is amazing. It's dark so it's really romantic and has amazing food. I recommend the pork belly. I go with my parents a lot and we all love it and get the same dish. I wouldn't recommend going with a bigger party then 5 and make sure you make a reservation WAY in advance unless u get lucky and find seats at the bar .
