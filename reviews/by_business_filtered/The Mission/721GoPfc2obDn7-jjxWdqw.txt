The Mission is wonderful! The ambiance is amazing .... it's dimly lit with beautiful chandeliers and great architecture. My husband and I dined here for my birthday and we had a great experience. The host was extremely attentive upon arrival and our waiter, Sam, was amazing! He thoroughly knew the menu and explained everything to us page by page. 

We started our meal with fresh guacamole made at our table. It was outstanding and they make it as spicy as you would like. Hubby had a really nice malbec with his Chimmichurri Marinated Hanger Steak and a side of green beans. I had the primarita margarita with Tecate Skirt Steak tacos and a side of the creamy chipotle grits. The presentation of the food was beautiful and tasted just as good as it looked.  Cannot say enough about the wonderful food, ambiance, and service!
