Very nice little place with character near old towne.  It was busy on a Saturday, sat at the bar, and had a little meal.  Mango jicama salad, halibut, and pumpkin bread pudding.  All very good but the bread pudding was incredible.  It was funny because the bartender said my name when I sat down and said that such and such was expecting me.  She gave me a free glass of wine all while I'm confused.  She came back and said woops I guess you're not such n such.  However, same first name.  I told her no biggie and that I wanted to pay for the glass because it wasn't necessary.  She was beyond cool and still wanted to buy me the glass but since it was the end of the bottle (still 3/4 full) she gave me another full glass right after.  Then after a while a ordered a different red and had that as well.  Man, I was full and happy but had to figure out a way to fit that dessert down my gullet.  I did, no surprise.  Will be back.
