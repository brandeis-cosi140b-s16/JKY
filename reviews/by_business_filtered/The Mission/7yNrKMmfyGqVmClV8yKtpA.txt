Overall, this place was top-notch.  Service was phenomenal.  Our server took really good care of us, very knowledgeable of the menu with some great recommendations.  Ambient was filled with energy flowing, fun, laid back with a modern southwestern, chic feel.

Commenced with some refreshing, "healthy" cocktail - Bloody Orange Margarita, made fresh using real fruit with no sugar.  So good I ordered another.  Most of the drinks looked really good.

For the apps or botanas (as they call it), we had Duck Carnitas Empanadas, Pork Belly Pibil,and Almejas Al Vapor.  We ordered 2 of each as we wanted to share among the group.  I would have to say I enjoyed every single one of them.  NOW, the foie gras that came with the Empanadas, I thought was a little overdone so therefore dry.  Foie gras usually is softer and juicier with balanced flavor.

For the main entree, we had this tender Pork Shoulder that came with Tortilla complemented with a nice sweet, tangy sauce to drizzle over. Oh wow, just amazing.  The meat was soo tender that you just peeled it right off. 

Desert - Pumpkin Bread Pudding, pretty good.  A little too sweet, but good.

I would definitely return for some more deliciousness!
