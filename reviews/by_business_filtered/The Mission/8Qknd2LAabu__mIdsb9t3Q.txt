This is some of the best Latin food I've ever had. The table-side guacamole was out of this world and my friends and I actually ordered two rounds of it - best $24 worth of guacamole ;-)

The roast corn gordita was really tasty - very different from anything I've tried before.  The white bean puree was also exceptional!

For dinner, I recommend any of the tacos - chicken, mahi mahi, steak, or pork.

Another Scottsdale gem and I look forward to going back!
