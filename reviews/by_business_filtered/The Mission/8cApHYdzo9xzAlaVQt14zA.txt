The Mission was my last stop on my food tour of Phoenix, and I ended it with a bang!

The place was surprisingly crowded for a Wednesday evening, and I had to sit at a bar table. I didn't mind; was just surprised. 

I started with the Mango and Jicama salad (no cheese), and it was light and refreshing. 

The drink menu was impressive, and I decided on the Primarita. It was crisp with a little bite to it - perfect! 

I sipped my drink while I enjoyed the Tecate Skirt Steak tacos, which were incredible. The meat was flavorful and tender; the spices perfect. The portion size was a little small - the corn tortillas were silver-dollar size - which perhaps explains how the Primarita went straight to my head?

I highly recommend this place. Ambiance, food, service - all are top notch.
