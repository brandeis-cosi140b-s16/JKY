I was on a mission to cure the lonely condition of my stomach.  Well, maybe it was a dinner with some clients.  Either way, I found myself at the Mission for the first time and quite liked it.

Staff took fantastic care of us, and the food was tangy and tasty. We had the table-made guac, and I snagged some of their Fantasma (?) sauce made from Ghost peppers to spice it up. Spice it up indeed. Woo!  Mahi-Mahi tacos also had a bit of a kick, and we ordered them grilled so they were quite light.  Washed it all down with a few Agave Margaritas.

Not cheap, but well worth it. I shall be returning!
