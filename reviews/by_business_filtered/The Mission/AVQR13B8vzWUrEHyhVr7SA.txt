Swanky ambiance, pretty waitresses and the place was packed. That's usually a good sign. Unfortunately the best part of the meal was the nachos at Bootleggers down the block while waiting for our table. The food at the mission did not come together for any of us. I had the duck confit with mole .... It was weird. More like fried chicken with overly sweet plum sauce. The meals were a little too all over the place for my liking. Drinks were ok. Very overrated and underwhelming. "Broken plate concepts" for sure...
