I'm late in writing this review as I was here on August 1st, but I wanted to make sure I put my voice out there. 

My good friend held my baby shower at The Mission and it was just amazing. High class all the way. First off I just loved the decor, it was elegant and fun at the same time. The illuminated salt bricks were very cool and I just liked the trendy feel of the place.

Brian, the owner, went above and beyond to make sure that we got the "back room" for my shower so we could have privacy. They even printed up our own menu's specifically for us. We had our own wait staff who was very prompt and helpful. We felt very important the whole time we were there.

Even though I couldn't partake in the mimosa bar we had set up, my friends all said it was wonderful, as well as the mojitos...I'll have to go back to partake :)

For my breakfast, I ordered Chilaquiles, which was fried corn tortillas topped with red chile pork, fried egg and cotija cheese. They were delicious. I think there could have been a little more pork on them, but for the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed them. It was like breakfast nachos, and who doesn't like nachos. The other dish that looked unbelievable was the Cinnamon Pecan Waffles topped with cinnamon helado. Oh my goodness...if I could have eaten two dishes, I would have definitely ordered those as well! They just looked tempting. For dessert we had the Espresso churros. The churros were okay...a little too crispy, they would have been better if they were served warmer and  if they were softer. But the milkshake that came with it was great! Very creamy and just plain yummy.

I plan on going back when not pregnant so I can also try out the tequila bar! There are so many things on the menu I can't wait to try. Definitely had a great overall experience at the Mission!
