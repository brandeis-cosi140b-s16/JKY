If you want to have a nice relaxing meal you better find some place else because you are on the clock at this place apparently.  We were asked to give up our table after an hour and 5 - 10 minutes to accomodate a bigger group (and obviously a bigger check).  Between the bottle of wine , an appetizer, and the main course I feel we were moving along at a very normal dining pace but not to them, I guess.  FIrst and last time there.
