The decor was impressive, simple outside with a very elegant interior.  
The staff was friendly, but not efficient at all. 
The table side guacamole was delicious but a little too thick and in a small weird boll that made eating it very difficult. 
We had tacos as a starter instead of salad, chicken and Mahi Mahi,  different and very good. Except they don't allow mixing the kinds so you have to have three of each, which gets old after two, if that were your entree. 
We had the salmon plate and chicken plate as our entree, both very good, beautiful presentation,  but extremely small portions and a little under seasoned. 
We didn't have a desert as they didn't seem very interesting. 
Over all, nice but not worth the price.
