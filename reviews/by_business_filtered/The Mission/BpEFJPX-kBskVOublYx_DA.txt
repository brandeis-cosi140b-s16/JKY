Very Very good. We are visiting from New York and know our food well. The Concierge at the Phoenician recommended this place and it was worth it.The Guac was amazing, the Chorizo was awesome, the Mission Margarita was perfectly balanced. The sword fish did fall a little short as the flavors didn't soak into the 8oz Fillet Mignon style medallion but the creole rice accompanying it covered up for it. The freshness of the ingredients was very evident and the chef deserves all the compliments for a wonderful meal. Will recommend everybody and be back when I come back to Scottsdale.
