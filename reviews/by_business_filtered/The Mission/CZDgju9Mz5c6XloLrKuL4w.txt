BEST TACOS EVER. Wow. After trying a few restaurants here in Scottsdale and being thoroughly disappointed, The Mission really delivered. The tecate steak tacos are probably the best tacos I've ever had. The handmade corn tortilla is tiny, maybe 3 inches but is loaded up with delicious, tender skirt steak, salsa, avocado and cotija. It is the perfect taco - has a balance of flavors, and if you are like me (a carnivore) the ratio of more meat to tortilla is perfect, the salty crumbly cotija and creaminess of the avocado set off the flavorful deliciously tender skirt steak perfectly. The table side guacamole was amazing as well. So fresh and had the perfect consistency and loaded up with red onions, jalape√±os, tomato, garlic, sea salt, lime and topped off with cotija and pepitas. The chips were warm, thin and crispy and seasoned well with sea salt. I hate when you get a basket of bland unsalted chips like at most Mexican restaurants. Not here.

My son got the chicken tostadas. Again, mini corn tortillas but loaded with flavor and topped with a spicy creamy sauce. Crispy and Delicious. My hubby got the pork shoulder tacos which were too sweet for my palette. Everything was fantastic! I am hoping to return one more time before we go back to LA.

This place is really happening at night. Very loud and crowded and dark. Very cool decor with crystal chandeliers hanging and a Himalayan salt wall. We were going to go here for dinner but it was just too loud and had too much going on for a newborn so we decided to go here for lunch which was perfect for us - it was not crowded or loud and we got great service. The staff was so friendly and they told us about their sister restaurant The House Brasserie which we are going to check out tonight.

I LOVE this place. My mouth is watering just thinking about those tacos!
