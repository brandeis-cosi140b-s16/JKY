After doing my Yelp research, this was on my dinner short list. This coincided with a recommendation from a hotel, so off we went. We sat outside in the nice little courtyard. Patio heaters kept things warm. The menu is just long enough. We started with the duck confit empanadas (great!) and got a serving of the pork shoulder tacos to share between the 3 of us (quite good, but the meat could have had a bit more flavour). The crispy cola pork was terrific; crispy flavourful pork on a lettuce cup.

For my main course I selected the port shoulder and chorizo roll. Our awesome waitress warned us that some people found it could be a bit dry because it gets cooked 3 times. So while you're starting with a piece of meat with plenty of fat, it gets a bit dryer. I tried anyhow and agree a bit -- it was still very good and I don't regret my selection. I tasked my friend's short rib and that was also very good.

Overall, great experience made by solid food, excellent service, and nice ambiance.
