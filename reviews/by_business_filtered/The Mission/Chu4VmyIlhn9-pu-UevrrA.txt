Dude, this joint has a HIMALAYAN SALT WALL...THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY LICK.  

Yes, let that sit with you for a second.  Strangers, lick a wall, over and over and over...and over...lick.

Supposedly, it has antibacterial properties. Still, I won't be licking the wall.  

This joint is cool.  Decor is dark wood, candlelight tables, and swanky music pumping in the background. The staff is attentive. 

The star of this meal:  Roast Corn Gorditas. AMAZING.  Highly recommend this trio of goodness.  However, this shouldn't be all you get.

The shaved kale salad had a kick, courtesy of the dressing. The portion is big and can easily serve 3.

Notable mentions: Cheese plate, chicken tacos, and table side Guacamole. 

Props to the staff for correcting a snafu with one of our meals and being attentive. When one of our dishes came out with an "unexpected" addition, they corrected it immediately by offering us a replacement and comping dessert.  

We didn't oblige, but appreciated the server and managers quick attention to rectify the situation.

Dope restaurant, and highly recommend if you are in old town Scottsdale.
