We went for Dinner there on wednesday night and I have to say it was one the better experiences I have had. 
The restaurant is part of an existing mission on the left. The interior is just the way I love it, dark, cozy and cool.
We chose the outside patio, since the weather was perfect. our waitress Nicole was courteous, knowledgeable and gave us advice on the drinks and the food.
We started with spicy margarita, fresh lime juice, good tequila, agava and a dash of jalepeno. Yummi - but be careful, they are strong!
We shared an appetizer of Crispy Pork & Cola Lime Glaze - excellent.
For dinner I had the Grouper, which was a near perfect 10. My friend had Salmon which was great as well.
We enjoyed some white wine from Austria - great recommendation by Nicole.
The one thing we did not eat, but wished we did, was the table side guacamole. Oh well next time, since I will be back for sure.
