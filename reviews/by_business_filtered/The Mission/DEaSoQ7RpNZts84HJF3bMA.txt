I have been to several UYE's but this was my first office hours so it almost makes it an OYE.  I got to meet several folks I had not met before and see others that I had.  The nice thing about Yelp events is for the most part they are filled with people who really want to be there rather than having to be there because of work or family or some other obligation.  Gabi is a wonderful hostess.  Not familiar with where I was going I made parking harder to find than I needed to.  I passed on the tequila as I wouldn't know a good one from a bad one, and I had to navigate home.  I had a great time.  Thanks Gabi for putting it together.
