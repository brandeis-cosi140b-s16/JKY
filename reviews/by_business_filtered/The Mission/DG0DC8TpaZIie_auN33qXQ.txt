I hate going to Scottsdale.  Too crowded, too snooty, and too far.  But I love The Mission.  Yes the ambience is nice, the people are beautiful and the service is great, but its the food that has brought me here four times in two months.

The posole and sope de elote are great, I mean really good.  The almejas al vapor was okay but not my preference.

I've had the mahi mahi, the pork shoulder, each twice, and they were both delicious.

Save room for dessert.  It's worth it! 

This isn't a place for skinny chicks who want a salad.  Bring an appetite, but also bring a few bucks because this place ain't cheap.  

Make reservations or suffer a very long wait, even in the heat of the summer.
