Every aspect of The Mission lived up to the Republic's 4.5 star review. I absolutely loved the atmosphere, with the dim lighting of different chandeliers and the lit bar area. Service was wonderful, as well - friendly and prompt. We decided to follow the advice from Seftel's review and skip the overpriced items like guacamole and tacos, instead focusing on The Mission's more unique dishes. We started off with the absolutely amazing almejas al vapor - clams, rock shrimp, chorizo, and more in a delicate but pungent broth with grilled bread to soak it up with. For entrees, the swordfish veracruz and the scallop dish both were fantastic. The Mission fries - sweet potato and regular - were the best I've had in the Valley, topping the sweet potato fries at Delux. Typically, Latin restaurants disappoint where dessert is involved, but The Mission is an exception - the pumpkin bread pudding with scotch, caramel, pomegranate, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream was WOW-worthy. I hope this place is here for the long-haul, because we could use more unique restaurants that fill an open niche (in this case, haute Latin American).

TIP 1: Skip the overpriced guacamole, unless you have a party of 4+, and the tiny-portioned tacos.

TIP 2: You might hesitate to order fries at a Latin restaurant, but that would be a mistake. The portion is enough for 4+, and they might possibly be the best fries in the Valley.
