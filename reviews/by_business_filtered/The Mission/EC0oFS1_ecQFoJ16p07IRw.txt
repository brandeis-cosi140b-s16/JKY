I often feel higher priced Mexican restaurants or overrated (why go expensive when you can go to filibertos?? ;);)) but the mission took mexican food to another level... maybe it was the ginger cilantro margarita and flights of tequila that made it all taste so good... but I was in taco guacamole heaven. We had the mahi, sweet potato, and pork shoulder tacos and the were each extremely unique and delectable. I loooooved the green/verde salsa they served on the side and the two different reds were amazing as well. The waitress suggested the corn and grits as sides and I was somewhat annoyed by her persistence to have us order more more more, but I'm happy we listened! Grits seem to be MIA in most breakfast spots in AZ (east coast I never have a problem finding it) so I was surprised to see it on a dinner menu..and excited to know they were chipotle spiced grits... no words.. so good. 
The corn was mouth watering and I realllllly hope it wasn't just soaked in butter, but they tasted awfully creamy-yum yum yummm!
We got the expresso soaked churros for
dessert and I wasn't in love with them-they weren't overly flavorful and looked kind of sad. However, the fried bananas were to die for and came with a peanut butter mousse that made me catch my breath... :):) Back Patio was nice except we were seated next to a huge fan.... bleh. kind of an ambience killer, but the food made up for it.
