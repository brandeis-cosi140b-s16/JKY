My absolute favorite restaurant. I take any relatives or friends that visit me in AZ to The Mission and they are always wowed. 

Both the red and white sangria are awesome!!!

The table side guacamole is amazing...along with the braised short ribs and tostados. Yum!

Service is always excellent and I've never been disappointed!
