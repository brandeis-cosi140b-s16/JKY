Horrible Execution
We made reservations to meet another couple for the first time and heard good things about the restaurant. The reservation was for 4 and we were clearly seated at a table for 2. I wanted to have a nice dinner, so we overlooked this oversight and just dealt with the close quarters. The inexcusable portion of the evening was one of the dinners was never brought to the table. After ordering we had appetizers and then 3 of the 4 main courses were brought out. We were told the 4th would be brought out in a couple minutes. That person did not want our food to get cold so he told us to start eating. So we ate, and ... The 4th dinner never came. It just never showed up. And the waiter did nothing in terms of status updates or offer alternatives. I felt horrible meeting this couple for the first time (my choice in restaurant) and only one was able to eat. If The Mission is going to charge premium prices for fine dining then the dining experience must be reflective. This was clearly not, and not the first time I have heard of poor management from The Mission. I will NOT return, and will NEVER recommend.
