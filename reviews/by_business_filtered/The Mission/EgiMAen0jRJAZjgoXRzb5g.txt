WOW! This place is great! A definite restaurant not only to return to, but to recommend to friends. I made a reservation earlier in the week for Wednesday night - so glad I did: the place was buzzing! 

My romantic husband did all the ordering for me and hit everything on the head. The Colorado Lamb Ribs Adobada was so delish - I could have had another! For our entrees, my husband ordered the Creekstone Filet and Diver Scallops. The filet was a bit too red for my taste, but my husband loved it! The scallops were the best I've ever had - they simply melted in my mouth! The smoked banana pieces that were on the plate were pretty and all, but I did not like them (nor did the people at the next table who we let try them). And of course, the Mission Fries were a happy combination for both my husband and I. I took them home and even ate them cold the next day and they were still wonderfully tasty! 

Our stomachs so full that we could not even order dessert (shouldn't have had the chips and salsa the waiter brought out twice). But, our new friends from the next table did give me a taste of the pumpkin bread pudding and it was exceptional! I will definitely save room for that next time.

By coincidence, our waiter ended up being the famous "Sam" and all previous reviews are right - he is simply great! He loved that my husband ordered for me, kept the food a secret, showed up at the right times, and was just all around a nice guy. The restaurant itself was lively and fun. The chandeliers and mirrors gave it a romantic touch and I also loved the tiled wall! Manager was on hand (not that there were any problems, just wanted to tell him I loved this place) and everyone seemed really happy to be working here! 

We will definitely be back!
