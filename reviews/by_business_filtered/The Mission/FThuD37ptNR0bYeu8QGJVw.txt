My picks:

Don Julio 
Spicy Pozole (red chile, smoked pork, hominy, avocado & lime)
Espresso Churros
Pumpkin Bread Pudding

I love this place.  Its beautiful inside but southwest comfortable.  The food is simply amazing.  I love the d√©cor and the salt wall.

Plus bonus points for having Don Julio Blanco, Resposado, Anejo & 1942!
