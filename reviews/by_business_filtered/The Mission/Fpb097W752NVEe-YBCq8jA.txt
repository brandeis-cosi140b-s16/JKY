This is not some super authentic Traditional Mexican restaraunt, it's a sophisticated fusion of a variety of latin influences
It's a 4.25 star meal! 
Chorizo Porchetta was  interesting and delicious !  it's not classic Porchetta or a chorizo you'd find in East LA or  the king of Porcetta (Rolo Roti!).
Vegetables Tacos were as good as one could expect.
Try the grits with the horseradish.
The Pork belly appetizers stood out
Punmpkin bread pudding!!!
Listen to your waiter.... Very friendly staff.

Portions are delicate and small and prices aren't low, but hopefully you are not looking for a "mexican all you can eat"

Only flaw... it is dark... I think the visual experience on this type of food is important...its lost but still a must when in Phoenix/Scottsdale.
