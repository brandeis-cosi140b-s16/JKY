Delish! Our group ordered table side guacamole, chicken, skirt steak and barbacoa tacos. All were wonderful but the steak ones were our favorites. We shared the spinach, date salad. It was fantastic and large enough for 2 to share. Finished with the unbelievable pumpkin bread pudding. We'd go back for that alone! Service was stellar. It's pricey but for a special meal, we would definitely recommend it.
