Well, first time I was here in September and I was in love with the place and food. Restaurant is located in the heart of Scottsdale. It has great ambience and elegant decor, so it does give a feel of a fancy night out. Though menu has limited vegetarian options but I was happy with whatever I had tried.  However, after my second visit, I am kind of second guessing myself! Today me and my husband thought of trying it again during the lunch hour. Place was sparsely occupied may be because we reached after 3:00 PM. They had limited lunch options but more than that we were disappointed with the consistency of the food. They tasted much better the first time than this time. We'd ordered Guacamole and Tortilla chips which was fine, nothing spectacular! It came with red salsa which was very salty. We also ordered butternut squash Taco and they said they were out of butternut squash and they will replace it with 'mushroom' and 'corn', which is acceptable but what they brought was not acceptable. All they served me was corn on corn tortilla with no trace of mushroom. For that price all they could offer was corn filling, really?? I did mention to the server but he tried to convince me that it had mushroom. I wish I had taken a picture! I did like the pumpkin pudding but definitely not visiting again for the pudding. Overall, today was an average experience!
