This review is based on how we were treated, not the food because we didn't actually get to eat. 

Called on the afternoon of July 9th and they said no reservations were open. I asked if they take walk ins and they said yes, but to expect a wait of about 45 minutes. 

We showed up at 7 expecting to wait. The hostess told us that they had no tables until 9pm. That is when their first open reservation would be. 

I asked if we could wait at the bar as walk ins and told them that I had called earlier about that exact thing. She basically said 'too bad' and that we would have to wait til 9 unless we wanted to eat outside on the patio (nobody was outside in this heat). 

I have heard this place is good, but the hostess was quite rude with her tone and basically told us to leave.  

It seems that this place could benefit from some additional training to make sure that all of the hostesses are on the same page.
