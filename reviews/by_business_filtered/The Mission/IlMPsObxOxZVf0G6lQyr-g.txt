It's hard to go wrong at The Mission.  The atmosphere is just beautiful, candles strewn all around ---almost reminiscent of a church (appropriate given the name!)---Eating in the backyard is really an experience on a cooler night.  All of the tacos are phenomenal and have interesting ingredients that just pop.  The street corn is to die for, and the milkshake churro dessert is a go-to for me.  The cinnamon they use in the milkshake is awesome.   The servers are all really knowledgeable, and the service itself is generally outstanding.  It is trendy without being pretentious.   GO GO GO!
