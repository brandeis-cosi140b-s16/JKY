My wife and I came here on Tuesday.  Early dinner, but had our reservations for 2 weeks. We sat inside. I saw several reviews about it being "romantic" but I would caution that the noise level goes extremely high. 

The cocktails and sipping tequila were a fun touch.  A tequila mojito?  Not bad. We started with table side guacamole.  My wife ordered a duck confit, and I had a chorizo pork shoulder. Both were good, but we both felt stuffed before we could finish the entrees. Too Rich or too many chips?   Either way, we felt like humpy dumpty. 

I asked my wife to order dessert, because the yelp reviews were amazing. Pumpkin bread pudding and chocolate churro were wasted (we left more than we ate). Now, we were not enjoying the experience. Overbearing noise, Rich food, and flavors all felt the same. Sorry Mission, I can eat...but you failed in making me want to.  

I know others will disagree, as this place did not lack business.
