My 3 year old (going on 10) daughter accompanied myself and a friend from out of town last Thursday ( around 7:30 pm).  There was a 45 minute wait for seating inside: we opted for the patio.  The ambiance is great in and out! I loved it!  The staff (hostess, server, busers & manager) were all VERY attentive! Service is outstanding! 

I want to emphasize how AMAZING our server was!   She was so attentive to my daughter's needs: which, was a wonderful surprise seeing as it's not really a child friendly restaurant (would have never known by the star treatment our server gave her)! My daughter had a good time and enjoyed her specially made dinner at the request of our server! 

Last,but not least, the food was delicious!  :)
