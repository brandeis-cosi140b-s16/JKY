Not what I expected. Especially after all the hype. I ate nothing that I could not have prepared at home for a fraction of the price. Dark, noisy: noise due to music too loud & people talking louder to be heard. Quite the din, because it is a small space. 

Needed my phone flashlight to see the menu. Too dark is not for me. This does nothing for the ambience and gives me a feeling that there is something to hide. Perhaps $12 guacamole. That's one expensive avocado! 

I only ordered a salad and the "tacos". Mahi mahi that was mehi meh. The only peeps at my table who ordered entrees, were my two brothers. Meat eaters. They said their chorizo whateveritwas was good. Nothing on the plate as a side. I guess I just don't get it. Rent must be really high, and of course it is a "cool" location. So now I've tried it, but it was completely unmemorable. 

If you like to sit in the dark, eat expensive and just "ok" food because you're a Scottsdale hipster, then this is the place for you. I was just pleased to have exited the loud "tomb" when all was said & done. It's just no big deal.
