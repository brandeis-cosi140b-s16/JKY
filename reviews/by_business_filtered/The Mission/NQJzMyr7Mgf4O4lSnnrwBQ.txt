We had reservations and still waited over 30 minutes for a table.. while that may have taken away a star, a busy restaurant is a good restaurant, no? The fresh guacamole was yummy, and the pork belly app is to die for. I could have eaten more than one order of those and my mouth is actually watering thinking about them. Drinks were a little pricey, but they were good. Restaurant is really sexy- great for a date night, but hard to hear (it was loud!) the portions are small so order up.
