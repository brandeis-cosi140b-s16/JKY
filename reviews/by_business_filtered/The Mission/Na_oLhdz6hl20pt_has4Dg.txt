The Mission...what can I say.

This is the BEST restaurant in Scottsdale hand down. I am a regular and here is why:
-Amazing ambiance..... dark with lots of candles and a salt brick wall. Really cool music at just the right volume.
-Creative, unique and perfectly executed menu. What makes this place so special is there is literally nothing like it in town.
-Friendly service. In my experience, the servers had strong knowledge of the menu and were real people. At a lot of these nice restaurants service is great but seems a bit fake. People who work here seem comfortable in their own skin and are generally fun to talk to.
-Top notch margaritas! I sat at the bar once and the bar manager Mike took great  care of us. I was pretty sure my girl friend was going to dump me for this guy...he is as smooth as it gets. This guy has to be melting hearts on the reg between his game and the tequila selection.

If you want to get in here I strongly recommend a reservation...pretty tough to get in even on week days without one.
