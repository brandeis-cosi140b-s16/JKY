The only reason I'm even giving 2-Stars is the ambiance and the fantastic table side guacamole. Beyond that, I found The Mission to be seriously flawed (at least on this given evening). My date and I decided to have a drink at their bar prior to dinner, the bartendress found it appropriate to wait on other patrons after collecting payment of our round which forced us to wait minutes unnecessarily. Once seated for dinner I can honestly say they I was presented with the worst short rib I have ever experienced. It was my dates order and she found it to be not worthy to eat and I quickly agreed with her. The manager, while attentive, did not agree that it was intentionally sent out unworthy of being consumed which begs the question, was the chef too incompetent to not catch that it was completely dried out and burned beyond consumption? All in all, not a good night for The Mission though I have enjoyed it many times in the past. Are they losing their swagger? Certainly seemed like they have lost their lustre though given the history I will likely give them 1 more shot at redemption. As for tonight, very disappointed ;(
