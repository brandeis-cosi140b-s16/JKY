Very good Mexican food!!!
I love the place -   Have been there several times and never gotten disappointed.  Important to make reservation even if it's a week day because after 7pm is packed daily.  High quality Mexican food.  Excellent tequilas - most try the mission margarita and the table side guacamole while browse the menu. If you go to Scottsdale must go to the mission a bit pricey but worthy.
