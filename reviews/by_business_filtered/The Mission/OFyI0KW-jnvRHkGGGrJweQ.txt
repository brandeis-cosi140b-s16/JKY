My husband and I had a great time here on New Year's Eve eve. It was packed, so we ate at the bar, and were lucky enough to have Mike (bar manager, I think) making us gorgeous cocktails the entire time...lotsa them. I'm pretty sure my slightly drunk self declared each and every one 'the best drink ever!'...I might have also clapped a couple of times. The new drink menu deserved it, though.  SOO GOOD. We split the mahi mahi tacos (delicous) and ate every single crumb/drop of the perfect chips and salsa. We will definitely, definitely be back the next time we are in Scottsdale. I wanted everything on the menu. Everything.
