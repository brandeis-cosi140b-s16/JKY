Food:
-Table-side guac, best and freshest-tasting guac ever; little guac man actually pushes a little cart full of ingredients to you and makes the guac, by your table-side
-Street corn, good, liked the option of having the corn shaved in a bowl instead of on a cob so I didn't look like I'm from Sparta eating
-Chorizo porchetta, decent but not the best pork shoulder I've had, wasn't as tender as I'd like, tasted more gamey than I'm used to
-Green chili duck confit, I didn't try this but feedback from my dining partner was thumbs up
-Pumpkin bread pudding with ice cream and pomegranate pieces, I approve as a dessert connoisseur
-Espresso churros, interesting but was just okay; didn't like the milkshake you're supposed to dip the churros in, hate alcoholic taste in my dessert stuff; churro sticks looked like poo on a plate

Service:
-Our waiter memorized his menu spiel but didn't seem too genuinely enthusiastic about anything, was very fatigued (or stoned?) looking the whole time, also his stoned smiles made me feel uncomfortable/creeped out
-Forgot our orders for a really long time and I almost got full on chips, the waiter didn't try to make up for it but just did his creepy-stoned-smiley-apology

Ambiance:
-Very nice setting, one of the few outdoors patios I like
-Lights are too dim and I couldn't see shit
