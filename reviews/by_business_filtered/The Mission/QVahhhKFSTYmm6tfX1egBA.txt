Could not have been more satisfied!!
Tara, our server, was so kind! She did an awesome job recommending foods to us. We enjoyed all her recommendations. 
I enjoyed the flat iron steak. Wow!!
My girlfriend had the red snapper and she loved it!
Overall, an amazing dining experience. This is a fantastic restaurant.
