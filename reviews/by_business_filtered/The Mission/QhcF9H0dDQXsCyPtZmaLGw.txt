We arrive at the restaurant and were excited for a lovely dinner. We were given a wonderful table outside by the fire; it was all downhill from there.

We move inside to  table close to the bar which was noisy and very busy.  We started with the table side guacamole  which was average at best. Our waitress then convince us to have the duck empanada, which was deep-fried bread with lots of sauce and little duck. It was tasteless and sat like a lump of dough in my stomach. We also were recommended to try the street corn which was gooey.

For main course i had the pork shoulder which was ok but lacking in taste.  It was actually a bit bland.  My wife had the flat iron steak which again lacked flavor.

We are frequent restaurant dinners and probably because of that have a high standard.  The Mission really was below average for us.
