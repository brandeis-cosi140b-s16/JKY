I was lucky enough to get to eat here during a quick trip to Scottsdale for work last month. Side note: I think everyone should get to take a work trip to Scottsdale sometime. It seems like the best city in the country for a work trip! 

The Mission had two private tables set up on the outdoor patio. The outdoor fireplace was a big hit with our crowd. We started with wonderful chips and delicious, fresh guacamole. I truly could have sat there and eaten nothing but guacamole all night and been happy as a clam, but they just kept bringing out delicious food. We had a Taco Tuesday menu that consisted of several different tacos. The beef was my favorite, because I loved the cut of the meat (skirt) and the flavor of the seasonings. I also got to try the chicken and the pork shoulder tacos, but the steak stood out to me. 

The margaritas were plentiful and so delicious. They just kept coming, and we kept drinking them. I think some other people ordered specialty cocktails, but I'll always have the margarita when dining Mexican, especially at a such a renowned place as the Mission.

I will definitely come back here next time I'm in Scottsdale, which I hope is sometime very soon.
