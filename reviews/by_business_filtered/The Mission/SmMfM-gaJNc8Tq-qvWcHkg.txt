Reviews about this place don't lie, just visiting and chose the mission due to proximity. The food was amazing, the table side guacamole is a must!! Grilled corn and pulled pork tacos also stellar. Had the cucumber jalepeno margarita and loved it! Ambiance is great, sexy mood lighting, good patio! Our waiter was really good about recommendations, basically had him pick our meal/drinks. Also ladies, the eye candy here is on point, great for a girls night out!
