We had a really wonderful dinner here....and not only because our waiter could easily have been a model... he was lovely and sadly I've already forgotten his name. I digress... 

While I was in town for a conference we heard this place was awesome. On a side note, the bathroom is super cool... We ate out on the patio & they are so nice they even set down cloth napkins for us to set our purses on (is this an out west thing?) Anyhow, we all ordered various specialty drinks and we were all pleased with out choices. We started off with the quac, which they make table side. It was delicious and the chips were also good. The quac is spicy because they do put jalapenos in it if you like (which we did!). I had Mahi tacos because after the quac and late lunch I wasn't particularly starving. The tacos were delicious. If you are starving, this would probably not be enough food for you, but perfect for a light meal. My dining companions were also pleased with their meals. The service was great and we never felt rushed or hurried, and they had just the right amount of attentiveness. I would eat here again if I ever roll through town again.
