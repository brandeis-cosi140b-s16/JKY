One of my favorite restaurants! Great food, service and ambiance. I recommend to everyone:) Must havs: tableside guacamole, mahi tacos, and pork shoulder. I have had almost everything on the menu and you really can't go wrong. Smaller portions but delicious.

If you decide to go for dinner it's best to make a reservation because at times the wait can be long.
