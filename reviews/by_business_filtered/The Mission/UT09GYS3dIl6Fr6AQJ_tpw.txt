The salsa is delicious, but they charge for it. Come on, really? Margarita on the rocks, it "rocks". Ordered the Prime Flat Iron Steak, medium rare. The steak was delicious, would order it again. But the steak comes out alone, lonely on a large white plate, it takes up only a third of the plate. The rest of the play is just...Empty. Nothing. The food is very good, presentation nice, but price is steep. You may leave hungry.
