Our server Tim was truly amazing!   The restaurant was beautiful...and we were excited...we had heard great things!  We had to change our table bcuz the hostess put us right next to the servers and all the noise...and it wasn't going to work for us! We just ordered a Few things and told Tim ...we didn't like too highly seasoned & hot!   So we ordered the kale salad....so freaging hot....neither of us could eat it...so much salt and maybe pepper...crazy dressing ...inedible...the Small  amount of goat cheese tempered it down. But...the cheese grits were good but...way too cheesy! The chicken was great but the smallest amount for the price! Wasn't worth it. Whatever was on The plate with the chicken...not helpful!   The haricot vert were so under down and once again smothered with too much seasoning.  Inedible!.really. Unhappy!  Our Remarkable server Tim! Knew we were un happy and gave us their signature dessert of pumpkin bread and vanilla ice cream...so delish!   We were so grateful!   You can do better in Scottsdale ...someone was way too heavy handed with the seasoning and the Mission sucked!
