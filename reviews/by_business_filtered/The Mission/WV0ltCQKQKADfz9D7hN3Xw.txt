I was initially planning to take my lady to the highly recommended Quiessence in Phoenix, but when a freak dust storm interfered with our plans, we found ourselves detouring in Scottsdale and Yelping for a good dinner place. 

This place is seriously quite excellent.  The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 is because I think they overcooked one dish and opted not to seat us inside when they easily could have (we didn't have a reservation so it is possible I'm not being considerate here).  The vegetarian options were excellent and I really liked our waiter--totally knowledgeable and accommodating.  

Definitely going to come back here next time I'm out there.
