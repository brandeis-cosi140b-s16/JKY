Went there for appetizers on 3/19/11. Good service but the food was lacking. The tableside guac was basically a mashed up avacado with little flavor as were the two skewers of oversalted chicken. The shrimp was salty too. Felt the food was overpriced and lacked the blend of spices found in good Latin food. Paying for the ambiance and Scottsdale location.
