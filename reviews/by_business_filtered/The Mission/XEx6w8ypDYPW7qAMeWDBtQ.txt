At least I finally went and have a review written before it hits 100.  Some things just take time.  

That said, we attended the Pig Roast on a Sunday Afternoon.  The pork was really tender.  The little tortillas we so cute!  Loved all the little itty bitty condiments to daintily spoon on your mini tacos.  It was fun to do as something different and out of the ordinary.  As a huge bonus, wine by the bottle was  1/2 price!!  Who~Hoo!!

Loved the sexy & romantic d√©cor.  Nice and cozy, just right (as Goldilocks said).  Their brunch menu looks cool, but I am not big into breakfast.  The regular menu prices did seem fairly high, so I am not sure I would come back for Din~Dins, but I would love to re-visit, and sit at the intimate bar for a Sunday where there is drink specials and of course to take advantage of their fabby wine prices.
