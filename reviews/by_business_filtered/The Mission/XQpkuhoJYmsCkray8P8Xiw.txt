This cozy, trendy, little place tucked away in Old Town Scottsdale is a hidden gem. The chef and owner Matt Carter captures the balance in his cuisine beautifully. I had the pork tacos that just melted in my mouth. The table side guacamole is fresh off the farm. They have a fabulous wine and drink selection as well. Definitely recommend this place.
