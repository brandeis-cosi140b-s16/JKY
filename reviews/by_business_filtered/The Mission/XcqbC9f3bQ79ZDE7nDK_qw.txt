I'm not sure how a place that has "loud" "energetic" and "vibrant" in almost every review decides that MY party was the loud one, but being threatened to be kicked out of a restaurant is not how my dinners usually go.

Yep. the food is good, if overpriced.

Yep, we had a couple of cocktails.

But we were seated in the BAR-clearly the noisiest part of the entire building and my friend was approached in the BATHROOM (really?) by the manager and told we needed to quiet down. Same manager came to our table a bit later and told us that he had received complaints about our noise level and that we needed to decide if we were going to quiet down and stay, or "shake hands and part friends right now". WOW-pretentious much???

If I'd had a gaggle of bubble-headed Scottsdale Barbies with me maybe I'd have no reason to make a complaint, but the youngest person in my "party" was 32 and the oldest 80...how noisy could we have been???

So, thanks for buzzkilling my birthday party.
