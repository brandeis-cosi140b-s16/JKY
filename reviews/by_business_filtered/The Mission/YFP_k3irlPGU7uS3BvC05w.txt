This place is over-rated!  It is Cinco De Mayo at about 4:30.  The place is empty for all practical purposes.  We're told unless we have a reservation, they can't seat us. So we're pointed to the bar area. It is now 6:30 and the dining tables are still half empty.  This is a good indication of bad management.  One doesn't tell a customer they can't be seat and must go to the bar to eat and then 2 hours later those same table are sitting there empty. 

The drinks are watered down and extremely pricey.  It is one thing to charge a high price (small Margarita $13 and a Mojito watered down $13) and to give value, it is another thing to rip-off the customer. 

The guacamole needed help as well.  We had to send it back to the kitchen for help.  You need to add Cilantro, onions, salt, etc. to the product, otherwise you may as well be eating raw avocados. 

The fish tacos were good I thought, but my wife hated them. The duck empenada was different.  I didn't like it, but my wife did. 

The service was slow to get to us, but once it did it was good.

I wouldn't go back to this restaurant.
