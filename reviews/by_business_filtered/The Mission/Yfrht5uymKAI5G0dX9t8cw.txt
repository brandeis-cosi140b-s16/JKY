This place has everything you could be looking for! Good for a date or just with the buds! The food takes the spotlight at the mission. Its not over priced and it fills you up! Fancy by my standards, however, all of the tacos were delicious and the tostadas were amazing!!! Get the table side guac to spice everything up! Just remember what you order comes usually in threes and there are no sides per say.

Margs are 10$ a pop but they are good! Atmosphere and service was amazing!
