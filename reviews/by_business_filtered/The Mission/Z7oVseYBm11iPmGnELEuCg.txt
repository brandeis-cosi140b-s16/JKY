Our first visit to The Mission. Won't be our last. Best value in Phoenix/Scottsdale by far. Service, food, ambience were all pitch perfect. Only negative: man the light is to dim to read the menu or see your food when it arrives....up the wattage on the candles!  Start with an avocado margarita, sets the mood and is amazing, smooth and refreshing. For appetizers we had the pork belly, too much for two because we also had the guacamole, but I am still salivating just thinking about it. The avocado crema and aioli gave the sweet pork belly a real boost -- a must order.  For mains we had the pork shoulder and short rib tacos, both excellent and finished by sharing the the pumpkin seed bread pudding. Zero complaints, manager and about three other servers checked in on us. The price was a BONUS!! $130 for two appies, three drinks, two mains and a dessert!! You can't beat it. I can't wait to go back and I always have a complaint.
