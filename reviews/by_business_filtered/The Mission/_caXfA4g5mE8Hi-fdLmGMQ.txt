This was recommended to us as a fun evening.  So, we went for a girls night out and in celebration of a birthday.  Our reservation was made for 6:15pm on Friday night -- and it was swamped.  The hostess said she would get us seated within a couple of moments of our arrival, but instead, we were scooted around by another server asking us to wait in a dark lobby area.  We sat there for 20 minutes and no one came to seat us.  

Eventually, we inquired as to our reservation and they agreed to seat us (fairly certain they simply forgot all about the 4 of us).  We were seated in the very loud, very crowded bar area and staff and customers continued to bump into our table and chairs the entire evening.  We really hated that.  

As for the food -- top notch!  The guac was amazing -- we actually ordered more after finishing off the first serving -- but it never came.  Two of us had the steak tacos and raved about them, one of us had the squash tacos and thought they were ok, and I had the scallop tacos -- which were 66% awesome (one was over-cooked and tasted like sand) the other two were amazing!!!  

Because we came for a bday -- we also had dessert -- bananas/pb & the churros.  Both were fantastic -- and we highly recommend indulging in dessert.  

Overall, we might consider going back.  The atmosphere and staff were not the best -- but the food is really wonderful!
