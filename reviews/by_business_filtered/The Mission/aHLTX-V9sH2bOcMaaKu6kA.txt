Recently visited with a bigger group so my attention wasn't on the details.  Love the decor and it has a similar vibe to Zinc.  We started with the tableside guacamole and all i could taste was salt.  Also, ordered the almejas with a side of bread for dipping but again way too heavy on the salt.  I guess if they are going to err on the side of overseasoning vs. under its better to over to satisfy the masses. Shared the fish and pork tacos with their homemade corn tortillas which were pretty good.  Still willing to give them another shot.  The staff was friendly but very slow and screwed up the order forgetting one of our dishes.  Probably will go back to try out their churros and sit out on the cozy patio out front.
