So, we didn't have a good experience the first time we tried to go, but we really wanted to give this place a second shot.  We made reservations about 2 weeks in advance to make sure that we were all set.

At first I was a little put off because when the hostess called to confirm the reservation she said that "typically, parties of 4 take about an hour and a half to eat. Will that be enough time for you?"  I was stunned because nobody has ever asked how long my dinner is going to take, especially when we make a reservation.

So, we showed up last night with a little bit of a chip on our shoulder about what the dining experience would be like.

It turns out that the entire evening was fantastic.  Our server, Rachel, was spectacular.  She took the time to go over the entire menu since we had never been there before.  She answered all of our questions about the dishes and made some wonderful suggestions.  Everything that we ordered was top notch!

The guacamole was probably some of the best that we have ever had.  The tostada was fantastic along with the crispy pork served in the lettuce (will definitely get that again).  The steak tacos were delicious as well.

Definitely get the street corn, it is out of this world!

We will definitely go back to try some of the other dishes (and we will definitely make a reservation in advance).

By the way, we were at our table for about 2 hours and not once did anyone come by and try to pressure us to leave.
