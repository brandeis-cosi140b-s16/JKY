Everything we ordered was over-the-top delicious. Pomegranate and blood orange margaritas, tableside guacamole (easily the best guac I've ever had in my life), chips and salsa, street corn, steak tacos, short rib tacos, mahi mahi tacos, potatoes with chorizo, and pumpkin bread pudding. Every single thing was amazing. I also love the ambiance of this place - kind of dark, lots of cool mismatched chandeliers, himalayan salt brick wall, leather menus - very cool. I can't wait to come back!
