Great food. Nice setting. I had the Jodie Chicken which was extremely well seasoned. It was served on a fantastic paella like rice smothered with Oaxaca cheese.... sounds rich but this was delightful to my palette.  The table side guacamole is a must.  We had it spicy and it set the tone for a flavorful meal to follow.  ....this is definitely a place to revisit.  The wait staff was very knowledgeable, attentive and helpful.
