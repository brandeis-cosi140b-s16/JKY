Ate here on Sunday 3/1 - it has a great reputation in town and we're here on vacation - our hotel concierge pitched it to us.  I should point out that we are no strangers to upscale dining in the Mexican or Latin tradition since we live in Chicago and frequently eat at Rick Bayless' restaurants as well as Salpicon and Tanta also great examples of the new Latin-style cuisines in Chicago.

First off, the service was bad through out the meal. Our server rushed us through dinner -- I think they like to quickly turn over tables since it's a popular spot.  As courses were brought out we had to ask for the table to be cleaned and water to be refilled.  

Second, when the entrees arrived they forgot our side and second cocktail that we had ordered earlier.  When the manager came over to ask about the meal in progress, we had to point that out to him that item had yet to arrive, and he brought the items and adjusted the bill to remove the late side, a nice gesture.

A word on the Jidori chicken item -- it's a dry (over-cooked) chicken breast for which they charge $28.  Not much value there.  At $28 why not do a half chicken and charge $30?  

Also, they have halibut on the menu - but it's out of season so rather than change the menu, they told us swordfish was subbed in for the halibut.  Again, a small detail but for these sorts of prices and its reputation, The Mission should pay better attention and not coast on its reputation. 

So for the money and the service it's not a good experience.
