Hands down best damn food in AZ!  Can you say flava?  By far some of the most amazing adult beverages you will ever drink.  The ambience is fantastic inside or outside. Do you fancy dinner?  Do you fancy brunch?  You are coming to the right place but make a reservation. There is an amazing fireplace in the front patio if you want that romantic evening.  What do I recommend?  Everything!  Something unique on the menu grits! Served 2 ways sweet or spicy you choose or get them both!  And one thing not to miss the table side guac! Enjoy you will be thanking me later!
