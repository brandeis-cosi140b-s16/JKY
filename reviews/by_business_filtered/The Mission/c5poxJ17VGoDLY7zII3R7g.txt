The Mission has a great South American menu.  The head chef was born and raised in the states and completed his culinary studies in Paris.  

Came here for lunch and was not disappointed.  I recommend starting with a tequila flight.  We went with the Anejo flight which was reasonably priced at $29.  Next we ordered the table side-prepared guacamole $12.  One of the best guacs I've experienced.  From the recommendation of our friendly and attentive waitress, Empress, I went with an order of the Pork Shoulder tacos and the Mahi Mahi tacos.  The chef excels when it comes to anything pork and it shone through with these tacos $10.  Highly recommend and I will most definitely return!
