Wow!  A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  Impeccable service, nary an empty glass.  No plates hanging around after we finished with them, promptly cleared.  Manager was making the rounds making sure service was flawless.

And the food.  OMG, the food!  Hands down the best homemade tortillas I've had the pleasure of experiencing!  The skirt steak tacos and flat iron steak were divine.  We both loved the Mission fries too.  Unfortunately we did not experience table side made guacamole, but judging by the 2 women moaning in ecstasy next to us, I'd say it's pretty fantastic!

Margaritas were delicious, and be sure to try the crispy pork cola appetizer.  Such unique flavors, you must try it.

Word to the wise, we're from Seattle and "casual" means t-shirts and jeans to us.  Needless to say, we were the only people in t-shirts and jeans on a Thursday evening.  I'd kick it up a notch if you can.
