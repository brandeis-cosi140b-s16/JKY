As far as food goes I REALLY enjoy The Mission, I have been here 4 or 5 times and have always liked what I've had and I've usually been able to try different things. Their brunch, lunch and dinner menus are all very good and unique. 

My favorite item on the lunch menu in the Cubano Torta, it's excellent. For brunch they have really good bloody marys too. I have never actually had anything I didn't like, but like all restaurants some things are better than others. 

I believe The Mission is located in an old church so the setting is different, however it is very dark and that has been a problem for some of the people I have been with (my mother mainly). 

The service has been great everytime I have been seated at a table, but the two times I have gone just for drinks at the bar the service was awful. Both times I actually left annoyed because their service was so poor. 

Overall, I think it's a great place to eat and an especially good place to take out of town guests who are wanting to try a more upscale Mexican restaurant.
