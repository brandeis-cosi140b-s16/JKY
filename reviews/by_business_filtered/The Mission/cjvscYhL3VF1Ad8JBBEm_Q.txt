Great service and the food was spiced perfectly.....better than most any other restaurant than I have ever been to. 

The eggs puzzle me though. They cook their eggs on WAY too high of heat on the morning that I was there. I literally couldn't cut through the eggs with a fork. When I brought it to the servers attention she gladly brought me back a reorder, but the reorder only had 1 egg versus 2. The reordered egg was still inedible from being fried on WAY too high of heat.

Everything else was fantastic. Oh, and did I mention really hot servers?
