This place is amazing, one of the best dinners of 2015 thus far. We made a reservation on the word of our local friends and went in hungry for everything. The entire meal was on point, as well as the tequila flights we sipped throughout. The pork belly appetizer will be in my dreams until my next trip. We tried nearly everything and loved it all. Thanks for the memories to the whole crew at the mission-- you all rock!!
