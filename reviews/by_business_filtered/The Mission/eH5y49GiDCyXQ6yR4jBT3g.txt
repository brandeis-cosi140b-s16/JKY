If you have any kind of food allergies I would not recommend this place. I told the waitress I am allergic to Gluten, dairy, soy, corn and potatoes. I ordered the Salmon and since everything that came with it I could not have I asked if I could get Steamed Vegetables..she asked the Chef and said they only had Cod & green beans. I specifically said NO Butter. When I got my food the beans were covered in butter..I even had 3 other people confirm there was butter. The Mgr tried to tell me that "The Cod has a buttery texture" ..non the less I left hungry
