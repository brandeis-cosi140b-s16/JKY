Went for thhe first time yesterday.  The wait staff is exceptional and knowledgeable.  Our table was comfy and well situated.  The margaritas were quite nice and well made.  The guac was good but not spicy enough, BUT the women asked for it medium.  The duck empanada was enough for 3 people.  One person had street tacos and they were quite tasty. One person had the filet BUT was quite small ( +-3-4 oz for $35).   I had short ribs which were tasty but a again very small portion.   The coffee and chocolate desert was exceptional.    The negatives are the price point is quite high.  I am not complaining but a bit more food on the entrees is warrented.  Ill go again but it wont be weekly thing,  $270 for 3 people is not a weekly venture.
