It takes a lot for me to be blown away and to be convinced of true authenticity, but this award winning chef and restaurant nailed it!

Dim lighting, gothic, mid evil style chandeliers line the ceiling as you enter the dining room, and you have an immediate sense of the caliber of cuisine. We sat in the outdoor patio which was glowing with twinkling lights and white table cloths draped the tables. I also appreciated that there was plenty of air to keep you cool on a hot August desert night. 

The true flavoring and fresh ingredients were so mouth watering and unique that it continued to impress at every bite. The smells, the textures, the surprise at every dish was truly an experience. Our table enjoyed a variety of entrees from the fresh mahi tacos, corn on the Cobb, kale salad, and of course grazed on some fresh, handmade table side guacamole! 

Phenomenal existence of this restaurant, and I can truly say one of my favorite cuisine experiences!
