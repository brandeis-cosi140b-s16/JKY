They have a fun and interesting take on Latin American food. Their tableside made guacamole really is some of the best we have had. It's simple ingredients done well. Served with house made chips that are really a step above regular restuarant chips. They are cooked fresh and topped with a nice finishing salt which takes them up a notch.

The pork is their specialty slow cooked for 24 hours and served with pineapple habanero sauce. The pork tacos are great. We will definitely be back.
