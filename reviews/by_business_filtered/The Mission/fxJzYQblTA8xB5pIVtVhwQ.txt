Not that this restaurant needs another great review, but I couldn't resist because it is one of my favorite places around. The mission is modern Latin and everything on the menu is delicious.  Its a beautiful restaurant with a charming patio. The service is always great and the cocktails are refreshing and strong. Some dishes you must try are the duck empanadas , guacamole, and crispy cola pork to start. The hearts of palm salad is delicious but the pork tacos are absolutely amazing and a big must. Also love the duck and filet entrees have a real depth of flavors. Definitely make a reservation because this place is busy for good reason.
