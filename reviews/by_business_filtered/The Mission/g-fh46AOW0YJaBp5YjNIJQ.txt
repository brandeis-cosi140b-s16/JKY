The ambiance is great...I'll give it that.

Service, however, was full court press, and yeah i understand that they are trying to turn over tables but when I am paying a final tab of $100+ for 3 petite taco plates and 2 cocktails (me and my date) i expect a bit more than food artistry.

Frankly, great concept by way of decor...but a bit too pretentious for my taste. Its a place to 'be seen' and to impress someone with but not particularly cozy nor intimate..i.e. if you go for more than dim lighting.

I certainly would go back but with adjusted expectations.
