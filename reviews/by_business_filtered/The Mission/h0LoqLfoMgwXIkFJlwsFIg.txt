Pork shoulder tacos for two.  Street corn. Duck empanadas. Table side guac is good but not sure it's worth the 12$ as it's a small portion and hello-- so easy to do at home. 
It's fun to make dinner into a tapas affair with a bunch for the table to share. Portions are small so the bill can get high quickly especially with drinks but it's a cozy and romantic ambiance. I love the fire outside on the patio and the banquette seating inside isn't too terrible either but for a truly special night I'd ask for a booth inside if you can't sit on the patio. I'm not sure how accommodating they are as I've never had any issues but it was a yummy dinner. 

Service was attentive but invisible which is kind of nice sometimes! No problems except fitting into my jeans the next morning!
