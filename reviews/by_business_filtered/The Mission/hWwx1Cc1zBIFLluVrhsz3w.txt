Riding around Old Town today I couldn't choose which new restaurant to try, Metro, Digistif, or The Mission. Glad I chose The Mission.

This restaurant is beautiful inside, with the beautiful chandeliers everywhere. They have great hardwood floors and travertine throughout, and a beautiful bar. There were no mistakes made in the design of this restaurant. 

The food is expeptional, and they call it a modern latin american. A mix of Peruvian, Ecudorian, Brazilian, etc. I ordered the pork shoulder tacos, and while incredibly small for $14 they were the best tasting tacos I have had in a long time, and definitely on the unique side. They serve you three of them and they are about 2 inches across... very small corn tortillas. I want to try something else next time for a bigger meal.

The service was perfect, however I was the only one in the restaurant. This is my new favorite lunch spot in Old Town. They need to either lower the prices or up the portions for it to be a 5 though.
