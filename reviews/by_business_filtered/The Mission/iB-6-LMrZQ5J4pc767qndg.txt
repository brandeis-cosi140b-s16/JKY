About a year ago my mom showed me a menu from this place and I couldn't wait to try it! Finally got around to trying it out for lunch today. I was super impressed! We came in and were seated immediately. It was incredibly dark inside which was one downside. The restaurant had a cool feel to it, I really liked the setup. 
We got the tableside guacamole and it was cool to watch them make it. Also it was incredibly delicious. I ordered the butternut squash tacos, it was either that or the black bean torta. I will get that next time I go! I am glad I got the tacos though. The tacos were incredibly small so I'm glad I had Guac to fill up on a bit! My mom got Huevos rancheros and my sister got the steak tacos. They both really enjoyed their meals and I did too. I left feeling very satisfied! Overall the lunch menu wasn't too crazy expensive too, pretty reasonably priced. Also the servers/hostesses were all incredibly nice which wins points in my book!
