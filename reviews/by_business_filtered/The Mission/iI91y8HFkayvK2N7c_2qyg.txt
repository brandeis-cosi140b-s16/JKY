The Mission is a quandary.  I like the flair and inventiveness the restaurant brings to the food.  Beyond that from the, "Hi, do you have a reservation" to OMG at the size of the check TM is hard slogging.  

If you're into food TM should be sought out but if you're looking for a good time I suggest avoiding them and that would be two stars not worth the time an money.
