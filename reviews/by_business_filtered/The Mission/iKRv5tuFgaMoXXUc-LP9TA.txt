We've eaten here twice for the brunch menu served on Saturday and Sunday. The first time was good, we were seated quickly, ordered quickly got our food quickly and while there was no rush to get our big party out the door, we left quickly because it was a SF Giants game day at Scottsdale Stadium.
The second time we came though, it was bad. We were seated fast again which was nice. We ordered and then we waited for our food. The appetizers came and were devoured, but then we waited forever for our main entr√©es. You might say "but when you have ten people it will take longer!" But in my mind ten people, 7 of which ordered the tacos and the other 3 dishes were a torta, the waffles, and a soup, should not slow the kitchen to a crawl. When asked about the wait, an hour after we sat down, the waitress simply said "oh it can take up to 40 minutes, but your food should be out soon!" (40 minutes for TACOS? Tiny little street tacos that the food truck at the farmer's market can get to you in less than 5 minutes!?). Another 20 minutes passed... Other tables around us, ones sat AFTER us got their tacos and were eating... Finally a whole hour and ten minutes after we were sat at our table, (roughly 55 minutes after ordering!) we got our food!
The tacos were small and not that great, the soup was large and tasted alright, the torta was mediocre, and the waffles were just okay. All in all the food was not worth the money or the wait. Save your time and money and hit up any other of the numerous taco/Mexican food joints Scottsdale has to offer.
