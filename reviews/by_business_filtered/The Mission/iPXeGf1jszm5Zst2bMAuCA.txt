Believe every good review you see on here, and get your tail down to the Mission!

Try the pig roast on a Sunday.....

Have a romantic dinner with your special someone....

A nice family get together....OR....

Have a kick ass wedding on their patio out back!

We had the best time with family and friends at the Mission on St. Patrick's Day, March 17th 2011.  We invited just over 50 people, and the patio was the perfect size, and that included having one the best chefs in PHX manning the grill, and putting out creative freshness on every plate.

The staff was nothing short of awesome, serving with a smile the entire night, and they seemed to be having just as much fun as we did.

We had a very special 3 days, and The Mission was right up there at the top bracket...just behind the ceremony next door.

Now stop reading these things and make a rezzie!
