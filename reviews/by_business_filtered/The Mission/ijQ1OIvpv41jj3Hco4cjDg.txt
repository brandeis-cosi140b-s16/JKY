We had reservations for the patio a few months back. We arrived on time, we seated promptly at a nice table and brought water immediately. However. It went down hill from there fast. Two different servers came up and introduced themselves as our servers. It felt rushed. We gave one our drink order, only to have the other come up and ask what we would like to drink. What...? The wine came a long while later. We put in an order for a jidori chicken appetizer with a server and some guac made table side. Both were good. For dinner we ordered the diver scallops and another chicken item. Right after one server took our order for entrees, another came up and dropped off dessert menus. What...? Did we not get our entree order in? We will never be sure when the entree orders were put in. Did the server forget? Why did we get dessert menus? It took almost an hour for entrees to come out. Which was fine as the appetizers filled us up. But still. Both entrees were good but I've had comparable food with proper service at other places. My scallops were perfect although I realized I wasn't a big fan of the set it was with. Boyfriend liked his chicken. We were planning to get dessert but after all was said and done I was full and completely turned off by the service. Our bill was somewhere around $130 before tip. I've worked fine dining, I'm still a server. This was the worst service I've ever had, not because the people weren't nice but because it was so chaotic and stressful and the energy was reflected onto the guests. Def not worth $160, which is a lot to us. Lastly, I forgot my sweater there and didn't realize until we got home. I called the restaurant and the host said they had it. I gave them my name and number and said I would be in the following day. I went to pick it up the next morning and it was no where to be found. Kind of ridiculous if you ask me. Save your money. There are so many other wonderful restaurants in Old Town with service that isn't so stressful.
