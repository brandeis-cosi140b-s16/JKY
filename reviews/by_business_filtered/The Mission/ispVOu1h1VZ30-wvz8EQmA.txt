I have been to the Mission many times, and had awful customer service, and will not return. I was with a party of 4, and we had ordered 3 appetizers, 4 meals, 2 cocktails, 2 ice teas, pretty decent  size bill and meal.  It was my mom's birthday, so I bought her a Dairy Queen cake, her favorite.  The waitress said there was going to be a $3.00 fee to cut the cake per slice. We said that's ok we can cut it ourselves. She then said, she would talk to the chef and see if she can get the fee waived. The general manager heard, and came storming up rudely and said, You brought food into my restaurant. That's why we charge you the 3.00 fee, and continue to talk down to us, as if we had brought in our own meal to the restaurant.  He said every restaurant charges that, which is not true. I have been to many locations, with large parties, where own cakes/ cupcakes have been brought in, and never been treated so rudely. Food was great, but tarnished by the awful and rude general manager. I had planned a party there for reservation for 8, but we will never be returning due to awful general manager.  Too many other restaurants in Scottsdale would be happy to help celebrate.
