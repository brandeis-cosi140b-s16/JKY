The Mission is our favorite restaurant in Scottsdale.  Their margaritas are fantastic - I love the primarita that has no sugar but tastes exceptionally clean and fresh.  The table side guacamole is also a must have. I had the Malbec short ribs and they were fork tender with an amazing sauce. My husband had the flat iron steak and loved it - greet flavor and very tender.  I have also consistently had excellent service every time we go to the Mission.
