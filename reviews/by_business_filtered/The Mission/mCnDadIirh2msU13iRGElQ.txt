If you are at The Mission and aren't calling this meal the best one you have had in Arizona, then you are at ANOTHER restaurant called Mission something...and you need to get to The Mission. Table side Guacamole, Spinach Dates Salad, Crispy Pork and Cola Lime glaze, Street Corn off the cob (that I would kill a man for), Chorizo Porchetta, Pablano Grits, and PLEASE DON'T ARGUE WITH ME THIS DINNER WAS INSANE!!! They haven't even brought out my Pumpkin Bread Pudding and I'm making a rez for tomorrow so I can eat more of this menu. Service from Noah was a supreme plus (as his recommendations really helped us nail this)! Eat, drink, and be merry! And if you don't think this is a 5-star meal you are out of your mind! Ok...back to dessert! :)
