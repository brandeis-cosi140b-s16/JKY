Love The mission!! I have been to mission probably 10 times and everytime is great. Love the decor. Primarita Margarita is my favorite cocktail there. Less calories, but delicious and fresh. The guac is delish and my favorite is the Tecate steak tacos. Best tacos I have ever had! Ok, so there is only 3, but don't let your eyes fool your stomach. There is so much perfectly marinated meat on those 3 tacos it is the perfect amount. We went on Thanksgiving and Tom the manager made us feel especially welcome and appreciated. Usually at end of dinner I have the French Press coffee, but only at The Mission because their blend is so delicious. It's like drinking cinnamon chocolate coffee. Mission is more expensive than most Mexican restaurants,  but you can tell the food quality is extremely important to them. I have no problem paying a little more for fresh, great quality food. It's totally worth it!
