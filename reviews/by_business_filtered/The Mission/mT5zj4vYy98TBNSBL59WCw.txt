I'm on a mission to find good Mexican food in AZ.  I'm not talking about Sonoran or fresh mex.  The mission is probably the best restaurant I've been to in AZ!!!  The outside of the restaurant reminds me of the alamo in San Antonio, TX.  We had the skirt steak street tacos, street corn, crab and corn pancakes, and the banana and blueberry pancakes.  It was brunch on a Sunday of course!  All the food was superb!  Skirt streak came in 3 small tacos, but was very filling.  Skirt steak itself was so tender and not chewy!  Crab and corn pancakes reminded us of the crab salad at zinc bistro and find out later both are owned by the same person! Win win!  Lots of fresh crab on top of corn pancakes!  The street corn was amazing!!!  We asked the server to cut it off the husk and it was made with some sort of sauce that had a huge kick!!! It was crunchy and sweet and then spicy from the sauce!  My husband and I still cannot stop thinking about it!!  I have no idea what was in that sauce!  The children had banana and blueberry pancakes! So yummy! The bananas were fried and caramelized! This place rocks and it is so affordable!! We can't wait to go back!
