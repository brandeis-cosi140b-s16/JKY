Beautiful restaurant, delicious food and good service.   Affordable wines by the glass and bottle, which is really nice.  We had a Chilean Malbec that was very good and was $30. for the bottle.   The table side guacamole was amazing!  The ambiance is very nice but I had to use a candle to see the menu, it's a bit dark in there.  The dessert of bananas and some sort of incredible peanut butter mousse was to die for.  Definately a great place to go for a terrific meal.
