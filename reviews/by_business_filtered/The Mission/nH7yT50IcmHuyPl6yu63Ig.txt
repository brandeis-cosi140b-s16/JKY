I thought we were going to have a problem because two out of the four diners were picky eaters.  However, everyone was happy with the appetizers and the meal. Our waitress Amber was fantastic.  Her descriptions and recommendations of the apps and entrees made ordering much easier.  Her attentiveness and her energy made our night even better.  I would recommend this restaurant.
