Absolutely love this place. I truly wish there was one of these back home in Southern California. Upscale Latin Cuisine served from an innovative menu paired with wonderfully tasting stiff cocktails. Need I say more. From the moment you walk into this place, you feel like you are right where you belong if you want to be part of the "scene." The table side guacamole that is completely customizable is not to be missed along with the house pork shoulder tacos ("for two") 

With four of us dining here, we were able to try a great selection of items from the menu. We thoroughly enjoyed all the dishes we tried from the Fried Pork Belly in Mexican Cola reduction Lettuce Wraps, to the Pork Shoulder tacos to the Chorizo Porchetta. I was ready to go back again if it weren't so hard to get a reservation. 

They had a pumpkin bread pudding dessert that was simply superb and their fried bananas was a close second. Don't forget to wash down your meal with a refreshingly stiff Cadillac Margarita. You won't be disappointed here.

Check out some of the pictures of the dishes in full resolution at kitchenrunway(dot)com. I will be sure that this place is on the agenda with each and every vacay out to Scottsdale/Phoenix.
