Overhyped, and overcrowded...there are great restaurants in Phoenix and this is not one of them.  To set the tone for the evening, we received a call the afternoon of our reservation informing us that we would be allotted two hours in which to dine. That would have been fine, had it not been for the fact that most of our precious two hours was chewed up by the overworked waiter zooming past us avoiding eye contact.  The place is packed and noisy and the staff is impossibly rushed.  As for the food...meh.  It's Mexican food done in a fancy style, but it lacks any wow factor.
