Great choice when in Old Scottsdale. Street corn is a home run. We also enjoyed the organic butternut squash street tacos. What a great combo of squash, cotija cheese and a hint of truffle oil.  Pumpkin bread pudding was a grand slam in a cinnamon caramel sauce with toasted pepitas and fresh pomegranate seeds. Visually beautiful and very tasty. Get a bunch of plates and share them.
