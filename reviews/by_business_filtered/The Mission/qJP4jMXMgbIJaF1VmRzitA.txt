I tried The Mission this past weekend while in town for a bachelorette party. Great place for a party, very accommodating of our large party. 

We started out with the skinny margaritas (delish, not too sweet) and guacamole. The guac was good but I've had better. However, I'm also from San Antonio and could live on Mexican food. We also ordered the duck empanadas which were out of this world; rich, with great texture and flavor. I had the steak tacos as my main dish which were good but not outstanding. I'm wishing I had conned someone in my party to split the pork shoulder tacos with me. We ended with the pumpkin bread pudding which was just as good as everyone says. 

Great vibe and decor although the lighting was so dim it caused eye strain and dried out my contacts.
