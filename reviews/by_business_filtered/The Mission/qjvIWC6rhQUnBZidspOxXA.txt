It's Saturday and  we are a party of four for lunch.  Had to remind the server three times to bring bread, had to remind repeatedly to refill ice tea, I asked about a drink featuring Mezcal and the server said she would check on it (I'm still waiting), had to ask three times for an item missing from the order, had to wait an hour for the food to arrive.  The explanation was, "we are very busy."  So why do I as customer have to absorb that?  If you can't handle the people STOP SEATING THEM!

The server had to take off one item that she repeatedly didn't bring, and never got the Mezcal drink.  Guess what?  You would have SOLD more if the service had been decent and gotten a bigger tip!
