Father Escalante meet Soho.  Not since Desperado has Old Mexico looked this cool.  With the exception of the out of place house music, the fusion was executed to perfection.  I echo the sentiments of many on Yelp regarding the service.  Our waiter was knowledgeable, helpful, and passionate about the menu.  The menu?  Every dish on the menu stood out, making selection a difficult task indeed.
We ordered some tacos. While they were on the light side, in terms of portion, every bite was was brimming with flavor.  The Kobe dog was underwhelming.  It is difficult to make a $12 hot dog taste that much better than its $2 street equivalent.  
We were just there for a quick lunch but rest assured we will be devoting more time to thoroughly explore the menu and to indulge in that pumpkin bread pudding.
