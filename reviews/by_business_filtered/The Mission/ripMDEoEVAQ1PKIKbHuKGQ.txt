Let's see, it's loud. Stupid loud. My server miss heard or fucked up my order horrendously. The server said she had worked there for six years. Acted like a rookie. I had to flag some body down because they left us with no chips once the guacamole was made. Then again to get the ice tea my friend ordered. I felt neglected. Then he took our guacamole before we finished eating it. She told me that she would serve the mahi ahi tacos to a five year old. I agree. Why beer batter a great fish like that? It tasted frozen or pre-packaged. From a restaurant that isn't a chain I was sorely disappointed. Let us be honest. The portions are great for skinny Scottsdale courtesans, however like most terrible Mexican places, I filled up on the chips. 

Maybe I just had a bad night. When I return I expect better service. I want to be impressed by the food. Till then, only two stars.

The pros: pretty decor, nice salt wall, and bar is well stocked.
