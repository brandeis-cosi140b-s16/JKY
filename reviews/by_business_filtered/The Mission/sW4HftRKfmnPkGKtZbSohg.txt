Decor was nice, service was fine, but all in all, just a meh experience. Flavors were not terribly dynamic, the heat was negligible, the portions were scant, and the check average unjustified. This to me was not "fancy" or "high-end" or even "innovative" Mexican fair...just plain ole' expensive Mexican Food stripped of its soul.

Personally I prefer to pay for the product, not the geographical location, but if you're the type of person to pay for ambiance and are interested in helping them pay for whats surly an exorbitant rent, have at it.
