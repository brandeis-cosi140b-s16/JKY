Where do I begin?  Way too many to list so I'll do a checklist.
Decor? Very well done and tasteful.
Service? It rocks.  Attentive, knowledgeable and friendly.
Food? Tasteful, creative, yummy!
Worst thing which was still acceptable was the parking.

I cannot explain to you how much I love this place and everything about it.  Read my reviews of my other favorite restaurants The Tuck Shop and NOCA and add this in the top 3.  

I digress.  The guacamole made at your table kicks fucking ass!  Absurd how flavorful and you pick your own ingredients to make it how you want it.  

I also like the fact that the patrons are in more than Tommy Bahama and khaki shorts.  Thank you Jesus for people giving consideration to not wearing the same attire they left the baseball game in.  If you are a foodie or restaurant afficiando, this is your new place.  Oh and by the way, no out of place looking people.  Call me superficial but this place feels right, is right and is the CHIZNIT!  

peace out....
