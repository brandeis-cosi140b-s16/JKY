Went here w/ a group of friends right before closing time, but the staff was still very friendly and willing to hang out late so we could eat. 

The table side guacamole is a MUST! I consider myself somewhat of a guac expert and I have never had it any better!  I thoroughly enjoyed the steak tacos. The meat had the most amazing flavor!

Primarita was a great, skinny margarita!
