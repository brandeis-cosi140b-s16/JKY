Awesome! We loved this place!

We sat at the bar to order margaritas and decided to stay there and eat. The service was fantastic. It's always a good sign when there are a lot of locals sitting at the bar as well. 

The pork tacos were great! Guacamole and salsa were awesome! 
Hubby got the chicken and waffles and would not share. They were that good!

Try the cucumber jalape√±o margarita. Seriously it's to die for.

Overall this place gets an A+!
