Very nice restaurant, great food, great service.  What keeps it from getting 4 stars are smaller than average portions and higher than average prices.  

We sat outside in the middle of August,  the cooling fan keeps the patio at a very comfortable temperature.   

We had the table side guacamole was great.  I had a blood orange margarita it was great.  My wife had a coconut mojito she loved it.  Again the prices were a little too high ($10+) per drink.

For dinner my wife was disappointed that the squash tacos were not available.  The waiter steered her to a vegetarian appetizer, that was very disappointing when it came to the portion size.
