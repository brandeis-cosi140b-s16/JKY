I was blown away by the food and service at The Mission. 

Our group was split into 2 groups of 8 and my table ordered a few guacamole and Street corn appetizers. 

The table-side guacamole was unique and fun. I am a guacamole snob and will say that while it wasn't the best i have had...i was still impressed with the whole presentation and diverse flavours. 
The street corn was ridiculously/ dangerously delicious. Just leave me in a room with a shovel and a barrel of street corn and I will be a happy person. Fresh, rich, sweet, savoury...everything you would want. 
I ordered the Duck confit and was not disappointed. Where the hell has "cheesy fried hominy" been all my life? The richness of the confit and mole was perfectly counter-balanced by the fresh radish/ apple salad on the plate.

The only thing that trumped the food in my eyes was the service we received from our server Crystal. As mentioned, my table was half of a group of 16 guys (Bachelor party weekend). From experience, tables of this size and demographic on a busy night are usually forgotten about and lacking in the attentiveness department (especially considering the auto-gratuity). But this was not the case with Crystal. She offered some of the best service I have ever experienced in a group setting. Friendly, attentive, patient, and prompt. 

The way our meal ended will forever be the benchmark of 4-star class service for my future dining experiences. Instead of simply dropping off one single bill of $1500+ plus auto gratuity for us 8 guys to try and split, Crystal did something I have never experienced. Without asking, she split our bill by 8 without any mistakes...not only that she even split our appetizers by 8. The BEST part? NO AUTO GRATUITY! I was blown away! This, along with everything else that had transpired lead me to leave a tip that was much larger than the auto gratuity of 18%.

An incredible Mexican restaurant with high-end flavours and service!
