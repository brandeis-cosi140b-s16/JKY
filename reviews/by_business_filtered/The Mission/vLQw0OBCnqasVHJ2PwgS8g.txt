Of course: Table side guacamole!
It was our first visit, our friends second visit to The Mission. We used their experience for ordering the wonderful food. 
There is a warm ambiance in the darkened restaurant. The lighting is very well done but it might be at some times a little too dark. The illuminated Himalayan Salt rock brick wall ( I read this some place in the reviews) is very beautiful. 
Waiting staff friendly. 
Chips and salsa and guacamole very tasty. Margaritas were good but I might not choose the Tecate one with the muddled avocado next time. Not limey enough. 
I had the Malbec Braised Shortrib: richly marinated and deliciously slow cooked with a wonderful red pepper chimichurri. The crispy quest fresco potatoes were somewhat undercooked for me. 
Our friend had the Shrimp and Creekstone Beef Anticuchos: the shrimp were simply delicious while the beef was tasty but not on the tender side. 
In the meantime the restaurant was getting full, busy and loud. As the lights got dimmer the noise level got higher. (saturday night).
My husband had the Chorizo Porchetta, delicious pork shoulder. The sweet garlic crema finished it off. 
All dishes were very nicely presented and served. 
Ah, the desserts: All good
I take one half star away for the noise level and it being quite dark. But on the other hand the darkness gives a romantic flair. 
The food is good, the people are nice. I say: GO!
