Great find new The Saguaro, which was where I was staying. Tequila selection was good and the margaritas are very well made by the staff of friendly bartenders. This review is only for the bar and I did not have a full meal here. The guac was probably the best I've ever had - something like 12 ingredients are involved in making it. Ambiance was also fun and somewhat upscale trendy with the Southwest/Mexican touch.
