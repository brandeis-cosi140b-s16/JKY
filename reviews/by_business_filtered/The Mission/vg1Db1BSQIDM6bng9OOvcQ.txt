My man, Dan H, gave this place three stars
He sucks sometimes, and generally doesn't like Latin type food

BOO DAN BOO!!!

Went here for the Yelp Eats event
LOVED IT
OMG, the new york steak thing was SOooooo good.

Service was awesome.  

Loved it.

They even put a sparkler in the birthday person's dessert.  FUN!!
