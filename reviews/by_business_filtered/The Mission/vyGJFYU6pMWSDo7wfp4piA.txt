Would I Go Again?
Two items highlighted my experience at The Mission: chips and guac, and pumpkin bread pudding.

Chips and Guacamole
To begin, they bring out a big rolling cart and make the guacamole right in front of your table.  I watched him open up the avocado and add pine nuts, cilantro, etc., and then he mashed it all together.  When I took my first bite, then I quickly realized I should have taken a video of making the guac.  It was amazing, and now I have no idea how to recreate it.  (I'm sure I couldn't anyway, but it's fun to think about.)  The all-important consistency was on point.  It was not chunky, but there were still enough chunks of avocado to remind you that the guac was homemade rather as opposed to the creamy, Cool Whip-like texture of guac from a mix.  The guac was awesome--the pine nuts, cilantro, and other juices and spices were perfect.

Pumpkin Bread
I'm not a pumpkin bread connoisseur by any stretch, but I would confidently challenge any other restaurant's pumpkin bread pudding to hang with The Mission's.  The baked edges, caramel sauce, and ice crea made me yearn for more.  If only I hadn't filled up on the chips and guac!  Sometimes the toughest choices in life are between two good things, right?

The rest of the meal was just sub-par.  The Mission is supposedly famous for its pork shoulder tacos, but I thought they were bland and dry.  The grilled street corn was very good but I can't imagine ever getting too fired up about corn.  

Simply put, I would highly recommend The Mission to anyone living or staying in the Scottsdale area, and I would especially recommend the chips and guac and pumpkin bread pudding.
