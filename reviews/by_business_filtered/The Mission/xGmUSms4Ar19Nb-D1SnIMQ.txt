I must be missing something.  It was our anniversary and everyone has told us about this place.  I was very disappointed.  The empenadas , were as tough as they could be.  The waiter had to bring us a steak knife to get through them.  The Pork was very dry - not impressed. . My scallops were not even cooked all the way through!! .  Even the table next  to us said there meal was just ok and they were from out of state.Will I go back-   I would have to think about iit!
