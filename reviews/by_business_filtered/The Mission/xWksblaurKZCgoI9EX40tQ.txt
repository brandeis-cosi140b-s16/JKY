Very disappointed in this highly rated restaurant   Arrived at the Mission without a reservation and was told that we would have a two hour window before a large party would be arriving.  This timing changed by 30 min which lead to a very rushed and un satisfying experience 
We felt rushed , we felt that there was an effort to upchage drinks and other parts of the meals 
It was like eating at the end of the assembly line 
While the manager acknowledged our unhappiness he did nothing to resolve the problem 
When leaving he said come back and I will  buy  you dinner.  He will not have to worry about this 
Rushed ,dark ,cramped setting  with a confusing menu that left us totally unsatisfied
