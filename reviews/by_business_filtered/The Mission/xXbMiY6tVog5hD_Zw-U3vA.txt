This restaurant is truly a gem that you cannot pass up!! My husband and I have been coming for years and although we cannot come very often because it is not close to our home, we are never disappointed when we make the drive! 

We started with the tostadas which are to die for! There are so many flavors and textures in this dish that wow you. A little on the spicy side, but so good!

We then had the cubano torta and the chicken tacos. Both were amazing!!

The waitstaff is attentive and knowledgable, even on tough questions like is the cheese pasteurized. 

Always enjoy our meals here! Just don't sit out back, too many flies in the back for some reason.
