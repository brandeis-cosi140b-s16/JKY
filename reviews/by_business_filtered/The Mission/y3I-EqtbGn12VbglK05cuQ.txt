i came here for dinner the other day while in town and although i had a great dinner here...the only thing that really stood out was the dessert i had....its the only thing that im writing the review on.

sat down at the bar for a bite and to watch the world series game...had some drinks. had tacos. wanted something sweet...so i ordered dessert.

FML. MIND BLOWING DESSERT ALERT.

we've all had churros at some point and time in our lives right...its kinda like eating a donut really...when its fresh, its amazing.  fried, sweet, and tastes like cinnamon...cant go wrong...

i USED to think this UNTIL i had the churros here at the Mission.

they serve up these mini churros here WITH a tres leches milkshake/ice cream that will make a grown man cry tears of joy.  i mean, im over there taking bites and barely able to control my emotions...knowing that i dont live in the area and will not be able to eat this anytime i wanted...

little deep fried churros that simply put, are the most delicious churro ive ever had...
crispy, fried, buttery, sweet, cinnamon-y, just simply amazing little things...

go to The Mission. eat the churros. you will geek out when you do....
