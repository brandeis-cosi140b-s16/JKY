I have been here to eat twice and while the first experience was ok the second time
has me writing of the place for good. I will say the service was always speedy and quick both times but when we went to brunch the menu has better options like the chiliquiles.

 My problem is the limited menu during lunch time and the quality of that food. The table side guac was ok and some could say great if they prefer it one way more than another. I would say it wasn't close to Salty's but not terrible like America's taco shop on 7th st. There menu consist of two basic options excluding the soup during lunch, tacos and tortas. Their tortas remind me more of something you would find at a wildflower except without any good mixture of ingredients. you would think that if you only served 5 different things you would be really good. I don't mind a small amount of choices, even if you think of your own home rotation of meals you cook for your family you could limit it to your top 5 things and have a menu that would kick the crap out of most restaurant menus I am sure. I had the brisket torta which seemed to be a mix of a lox and a thin(super thin) layer of burnt beef. My girlfriend thought the same. My friend had another one that looked better but she said she wouldn't rush to come back for it. The side of beans were ok and the chorizo and potatoes were ok more for the potato side as the chorizo was semi bland and couldn't hold a candle to any Shreiner's offering.

So we had a 90$ lunch (no alcohol) that had faux latin food. When I went to brunch my girl did like the drinks and the chiliquiles are good but you could do better from any torta chain with little effort and just suffer from the ambiance for better food. Guero's tortas comes to mind but like I said even Subway could own these guys.
