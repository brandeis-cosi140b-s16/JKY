I came here for brunch with the fam a few weeks ago and loved it. I had the Mission Huevo Ranchero w/ red chile pork and it was delicious. The french press coffee was also really good and they even brought an extra cup set so I could share with my parents.

Next time, we will have to come back for dinner. It's also not very far from where my parents live and I'm usually in town at least twice a year.
