OMG.  So incredibly good and very consistent.  This place is hands down my absolute favorite place in Scottsdale.  Great atmosphere, great drinks, great food, great servers, great owners, what more can you ask for??  I visited the Mission the first time for Valentine's Day dinner when my boyfriend took me based on Yelp reviews.  We weren't sure what exactly we were getting ourselves into, but we took advice from many reviewers for the pork shoulder tacos.  We ended up getting the chips and salsa, a cheese plate, the pork shoulder tacos, a side of chipotle grits and ended with the pumpkin bread pudding.  Needless to say we were stuffed, but extremely happy.  We went back last night to take some friends who recently moved to the area, and they left just as happy as we did the first time.  My boyfriend and I wanted to branch out and get something new, but we had the best meal the first time that we did a repeat for round 2, although we got the churros instead of the bread pudding which were delish.  Sometimes you remember something tasting perfectly, and then you get it again and it doesn't quite live up to your mind's expectations.  Well, the Mission know's what's up.  It was just as good, if not better, than last time.  There is a reason this place has so many reviews, it practically speaks for itself.  I would highly recommend the pork shoulder tacos, the chipotle grits (so money) and some type of dessert.  They have a great bartender too - I had the strawberry coconut mojito, and it was tasty.  Their margs are pretty good too.  I can't wait to go back and maybe, just maybe, try something else!
