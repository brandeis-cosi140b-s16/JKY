Was not impressed with the food or beverages.  To start with I had two draft beers, both were flat and had no lacing in the the glass (dirty glassware).  It was Sunday so I went with the Chicken and waffles which was highly suggested by the server.  Wheat waffles does not make any since to me, if someone orders waffles they are not concerned about eating healthy for that day,  The waffles were flabby and not crisp and the chicken was made to be more of an art piece.  Every kitchen has it bad days the at least they are not defacing good quality craft beer with dirty beer lines and glasses.
