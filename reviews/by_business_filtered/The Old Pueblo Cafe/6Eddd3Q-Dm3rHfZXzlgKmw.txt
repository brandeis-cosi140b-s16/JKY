We went there for lunch and beat a sizable crowd.  Based on that there were high expectations for the food.  Unfortunately what we got was the worst green chili Chimichanga ever.  Although it was properly cooked on the outside, the filling was totally tasteless and thin.  The service was good and there was a crowd so it may be a fluke that our chimi was so bad but we cannot recommend it based on this initial experience.
