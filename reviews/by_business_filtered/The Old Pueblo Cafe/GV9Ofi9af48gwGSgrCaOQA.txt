This place is pretty decent and maybe we should come here more often.  The Husband and I have been here twice for food and drinks.  Their margaritas are pretty tasty and the chips and salsa are really good.  I don't remember what I ordered for an entree, but the next time I go back, I will update my review.  The servers were really nice and friendly too.  I like the fact that there's plenty of outdoor seating because who doesn't love sipping margaritas when the suns shining and the breeze is nice :)  We will be back!
