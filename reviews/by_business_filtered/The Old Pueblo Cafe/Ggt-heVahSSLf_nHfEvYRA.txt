Service was absolutely horrible.  Our appetizers came out after our meals even though we kept asking for them.  A Margarita was brought out after 3 times asking for it and it was all melted.  The food wasn't hot.  This is a poor excuse for a restuarant.  The guacamole was tasteless.  Everything was bad all around.  ychhh
