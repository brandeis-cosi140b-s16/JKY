We used to love this place. Great drinks, salsa, and food. Last few times have been very disappointing.  Tonight, terrible service, very slow... Three different servers brought us stuff every 15 minutes. Food was dry an not flavorful. We had to wave down another server for our check, then wait another 15 minutes an finally took it to the bar to pay out. It's Friday night, hire some attentive staff. We won't be back. This great lil restaurant has gone down hill the last few years.  Not recommended, go down the street to Manny's, good food an great service!
