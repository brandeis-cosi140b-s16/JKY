Thursday night around 9pm.

If you show your customers how messy you are I don't want to know what goes on where I can't see. 


As I walked in through the doors I couldn't help to notice we were the only ones in the restaurant. Two ladies sat on the corner having a conversation. Me and my girl stood at the door way trying to figure out if we self seat or wait. Finally one of the ladies in a loud voice says "this side of the restaurant closed early however if you go across the way towards the bar side they can take your order".

I walked through another set of doors and take a seat. I take a look around my surroundings only to realize their are  a number of tables scattered across the room with partial food on their plates, dirty empty glasses. You can clearly see they had been their for a while all the meanwhile I observe 3 workers having a good time near the bar. I counted less than 10 customers.


I walked out.
