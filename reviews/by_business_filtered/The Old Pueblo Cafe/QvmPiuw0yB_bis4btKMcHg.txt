This pains me to say, since we were regulars here, but as this place grows in popularity, the quality drops drastically. I still enjoy the salsa (separate pico de gallo and hot sauce that you mix table side) and the pre-cooked selections (green chile pork for instance). However, the last few times we have been there, we got soggy tacos, poor service and cold food... which is just inexcusable. There is NO quality control. Food should never, ever be allowed to leave the kitchen in such condition, but no one is checking.

On top of that, we have been in this place at least 10 times when the owner was present, and he is an issue. He likes to schmooze with the pro's from the golf course, but if you are just  a patron, you don't count. I saw him in a confrontation with another customer over the service and instead of listening to the guy's valid complaint (customer was a little over the top, but that is par for the course these days), he stomped off in a huff. That told me that he just didn't care what the guy had to say.

Add to that, when we sent back our soggy tacos, we were told by the owner, "that's kinda how we make them here". So, you seriously dip a taco into hot oil so that it comes out soft and mushy? That was the most ignorant and maybe arrogant thing I have ever been told in a restaurant. 

The kitchen itself is very small and there is no way to get food out quickly to the number of patrons that they can seat, especially when the patio is full. So, when crowded, stay away. The food takes forever...like 40 minutes up to an hour...and it probably won't be up to snuff. If it is a slow day, you have a decent chance to enjoy a good meal, but you just never know what to expect. 

A word of advice to the owner: Either don't seat more customers than you can serve or expand your kitchen. You are starting to alienate the locals. 

If it wasn't for the Litchfileld Park location and the ambiance of the area, this restaurant would die in three months.
