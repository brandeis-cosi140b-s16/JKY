First class experience.

The outdoor seating was perfect.  Went on a Friday night and the place was busy, but not over packed.

Got seated right away and our unlimited chips and salsa and drinks were brought ASAP.

The carne asada nachos..... top notch. I really love my nachos.

The nachos were so good that I had to get the carne asada dinner as well, and as I had hoped, it was delicious.

Great food, great atmosphere, great mexican dishes. I recommend this place and will be back soon.
