I wanted to try something different tonight and I found it. The night that I went there was nobody sitting inside but all but one of the tables outside had people in them. There was a great patio, very open and connected with other restaurants and bars so it was a very social setting. The other reviews talked about the pico de gallo , I must agree it was nice chunks of fresh cut tomatoes, onions and all that other good stuff. the drink prices were super reasonable and my party even opted for a pitcher of the house margarita, only $20! Our server suggested the Mexican flag enchilada plate which I picked. It was a chicken, steak and spinach enchilada with rice and beans. This was a huge plate of food, took half of it home. I was very happy with the food, the service, the drinks and the atmosphere, definitely will go back.
