The food here is worse than chain Mexican and the service is forgetful as best, inattentive at worst. 

We were served old, dried out and tasteless  pico along with crumbly chips, followed by old and dry corn tortillas with no moisture of any kind on the fish tacos. No hot sauce available other than tabasco. 

This is, unfortunately, my third time here and it is always this way. I only keep coming here because it's the closest place off-site from the Wigwam Resort, which is where I have to come for work. 

Even the sushi place next door is better. Think about that for a moment...a sushi place in AZ is better than this Mexican joint.
