Have eaten here several times because it is so close to home.  I have had the enchiladas and the tacos.  Both were good, but I preferred the enchiladas.  The salsa is made fresh and is excellent. It's actually one of the main reasons I go there. Outside atmosphere is great unless the bar next door has karaoke or live music making it difficult to have a conversation.
