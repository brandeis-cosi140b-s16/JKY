We visited this location to support a fundraiser. We appreciated that they took part in the fundraiser but the food was boring and the service was slow and totally bored out of their mind too. The outside table next to us actually had a chair break while they were dining, I felt so bad. I am not sure if anyone even helped them out. Nothing special but I do appreciate the help they gave fundraising.
