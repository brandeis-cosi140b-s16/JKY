I have been eating here for years and this is the first time I have wanted to complain. Our server only came to our table twice, the other server had to bring us chips, our drinks were empty for the majority of our meals. When we were finished eating we sat for 20 minutes before she returned to give us our checks then another 15 before she returned to collect. She only had 2 tables. And treated the other table the same. I absolutely love the food here never have complaints about that ever but the service has really gone down.
