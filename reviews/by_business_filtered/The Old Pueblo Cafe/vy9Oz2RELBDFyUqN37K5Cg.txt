The atmosphere of Old Pueblo Cafe makes you feel like you are crowded into a "old Pueblo" which some may like but I felt was a little cramped. The food in my opinion was catered to the nice next door hotel and not towards those seeking truly authentic Mexican food. The price point is a bit high though the service is exceptionable. The salsa is great like the other reviews said but I honestly don't know if that was enough to earn repeat business. The combo plates are good but the rice and beans need some life, because they seem to be stuck in dryville. I think more tex-mex style consumers would enjoy this place to it's fullest so I'll rate it A-ok for them.
