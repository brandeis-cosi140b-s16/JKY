Came in after probably a year without eating here on a Saturday morning to watch the ASU game at open. It took four employees 20 minutes to figure out how to get the game on, terrible service, mediocre food at best. I always spoke highly of this restaurant as my daughter goes to school across the street. I won't be back.
