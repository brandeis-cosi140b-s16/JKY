Had The #62 Carne Asada Tacos. Ewww so freaky greasy, I picked it up and the tortilla fell apart from it being so soft from the grease. The rice had no flavor what so ever. The beans were ehh. The chips were flavorless. I don't know who is cooking this food but it's definitely not mexican food. NO BUENO!!!!
