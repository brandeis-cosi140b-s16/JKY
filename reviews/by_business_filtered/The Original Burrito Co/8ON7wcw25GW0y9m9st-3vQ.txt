I was skeptical at first, could a burrito joint in Ahwatukee be that good? YES. The salsa is fresh and everything I've ordered from the menu has been fingerlicking good! I've recently discovered the green chili burrito and it has been my favorite item thus far! Each item comes with a serving chips regardless if you dine in or take it to go. During the holidays, I was able to order a half dozen of frozen tamales which you can just pop in the microwave or steam in a pot. They tasted almost as good as my mother in laws!!
