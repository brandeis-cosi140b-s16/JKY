Viewing all these great reviews, leads me to one conclusion, people don't know what a good burrito taste like. I had a machaca burrito and it was way too dry. The meat was shredded but it was clumpy (is that a word?) and would stick to the roof of my mouth. My boyfriend had a taco of each of their meats, and he was surprised that even the carne asada was bad. Who messes up carne asada?

Take it from a Mexican who knows Mexican food and skip on this joint.
