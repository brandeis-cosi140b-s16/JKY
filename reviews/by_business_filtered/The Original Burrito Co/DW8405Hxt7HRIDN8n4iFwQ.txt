Thank you Yelp reviews!  I would have never given this place a glance set back in the corner of a strip center - what a find!  It's a regular lunch stop now - I'll never be able to enjoy Chipotle again!

Excellent burritos at an equally excellent price - I'm working my way through the menu.  Everyone that works there is very nice, salsas are excellent, and a great patio to sit outside and not feel like your in a parking lot.
