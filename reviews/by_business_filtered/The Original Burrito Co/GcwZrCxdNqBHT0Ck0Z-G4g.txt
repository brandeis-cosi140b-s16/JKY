I used to stop here for breakfast burritos on my way to work all the time (the #12 veggie), but now that I'm laid off, no more burritos for me.  I've had most things on their menu, the fish burritos are really good if you eat them right away while the fish is still crisp and as for everything else, it's all good, but my heart belongs to Filibertos.  I like everything here, but I like it better at Filibertos.  Since there isn't one around and if you're near the Original Burrito Company, stop here, you won't be disappointed.
