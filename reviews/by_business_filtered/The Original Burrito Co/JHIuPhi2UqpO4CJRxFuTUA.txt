This was my first time to The Burrito Company and it was pretty good. It is exactly what you expect it to be. A large restaurant that specializes in different burritos. They serve breakfast all day so I had the sausage, egg, and cheese burrito. I took the liberty of adding potatoes, tomatoes, and guacamole to it to dress it up. It was pretty delicious. My only issue is there wasn't as much meat in the burritos as I thought there should be. Other than that it was delicious. Bring your appetite because they are huge.
