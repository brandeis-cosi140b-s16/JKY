I dream about this place sometimes. I've been going to Burrito Co for over a decade and just love it. The salsa is so good, bean & cheese burro's delicious! They also have other great burros, but I am soo down the with this B&C that I hardly stray. 

Prices are pretty decent and the staff is nice. That being said, I am not a huge fan of the new building. It doesn't have the same charm/ambience as the original and I miss it.
