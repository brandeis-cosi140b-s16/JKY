This place is really yummy! 

It is right across the street from work so I go here once or twice a week. They have really good breakfast burritos for around 3 bucks. They're pretty filling, so it is a great value. They also have good lunch burritos, also reasonably priced.

The staff is always REALLY friendly. I usually pick up to go and it is pretty quick. You wait a bit longer during lunch rush, but it's definitely worth the wait!
