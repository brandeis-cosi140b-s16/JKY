So I've gota bad habit of ordering the same thing over and over. I broke that mold the other day and decided to get a green chilie burrito.

NOT. DISAPPOINTED. DELICIOUS.

Quite honestly, I don't know why there are so many negative reviews of this place. They are always friendly, always quick, and the food has always been good. Are people mad that they have to pick up their food at the window or something?

I still love the salsa too.

Looking forward to my next visit!
