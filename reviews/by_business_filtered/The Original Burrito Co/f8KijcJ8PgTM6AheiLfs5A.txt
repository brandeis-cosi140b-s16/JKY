I like this place.  Don't come expecting like Filiberto's or an authentic Mexican place.  Instead think of this as a mix in between Baja Fresh and Filiberto's.  The owners and cook make their meat as authentic and Mexican as they can, but they would make very interesting  creations, in addition to the regular beef burrito. 

Its like what Pita Jungle did with Gyros and Arabic food.  This is their more modern and adventurous take on good Mexican food.  Its a pretty well kept secret because I see the crowd that comes here are people who live around this place who comes in after a run or hike, and people who drive around for work kind, delivery guys, AAA vehicle guys, construction vehicles.  I don't think they use Yelp thus, only 2 reviews so far.

Check it out, you will be pleasantly suprised.
