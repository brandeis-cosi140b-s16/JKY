What a cute little place !! It's very casual
And very Delish . There are 2 kinds of salsa, A basic red and basic green. Both were yummy . I had the carne asada burrito which comes with a side of chips . It was huge !! It was filled with meat, guacamole & cheese . Really really tasty . My bf had the carne asada nachos . They looked amazing and he stated they were one of the best he's ever had . You serve yourself and bus your own tables , but everything on the menu is dirt cheap so it's totally worth it . I can't wait to come back
