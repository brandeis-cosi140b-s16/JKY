Burrito Company is one of me and my fiancee's favorite places in Ahwatukke. Especially now that they moved into a new, larger building, they are super fast and have delicious food! Something that sets them apart from other places is that they offer whole wheat tortillas, an option that I really like.  Everyone that works there is very friendly and we love that you can call in your orders for pick up! I would definitely recommend the Burrito Company and would also recommend that you try the #5 (carne asada burrito)!
