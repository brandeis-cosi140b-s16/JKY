The first time I ate here I had a veggie burrito and it was really good.  Living close by I thought I found the perfect spot for a good morning burrito.  The past few times that I've been here not only does the Burrito continue to get smaller and smaller and shorter but the quality of the contents are tasteless. 

For the veggie burrito you basically you get a burrito with barely cooked rice a little bit of sour cream and a smudge of guacamole.  We also got a breakfast burrito of potatoes eggs and cheese.  The potatoes were dry the eggs were dry and the cheese sparse.  And again the red salsa had too much cinnamon in it.

And finally the temperature was nearly unbearable. I watched people as they entered the building fanning themselves because the temperature was so unbearable and this was at 8 o'clock in the morning. 

I'm sure will be back again because we live so close but it's just not going to be my fave.
