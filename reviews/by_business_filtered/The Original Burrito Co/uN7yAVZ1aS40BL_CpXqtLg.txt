Winner of best food in AZ (my opinion) We come here just about every weekend, sometime even during the week to pick up the Marco Polo Burrito- we order with potatoes instead of rice and add cheese. The original burrito has always given supreme service with a smile and we've always gotten our favorite burrito cooked perfectly how we ordered it every time without fail. 

All the menu items are delicious you can't go wrong with anything that you choose. Be cautious on a Saturday morning you might have to wait a little due to the popularity of their amazing food... Trust me, it's worth the wait! 

Alternatively you can call in your order, when you arrive you won't have to stand in line and you'll be able to go right to the front to pick up the delicious food that is waiting for you don't forget to pick up a large drink the size is good for two people! 

This by far is the best decision to make when you're looking for a hearty delicious well prepared meal and great service to go along with it!
