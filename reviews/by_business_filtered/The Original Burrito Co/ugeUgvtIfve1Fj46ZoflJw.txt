Went here for lunch.

Ordered the California Burito.

The burrito was quite good. I haven't had a lot of burritos in my life, and the few I did have were mostly from Chipotles.  This burrito was hands down better than any burito I'd eaten in Chipotles.

They have staff to handle the lunch crowd.  We ordered and grabbed a table.  Order # is hollered out when ready.

I'd recommend this place for lunch.
