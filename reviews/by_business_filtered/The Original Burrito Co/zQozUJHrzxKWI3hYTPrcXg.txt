One of my fav places for good Mexican food. Authentic music playing and it always smells like something wonderful is cooking. The interior is decorated with nostalgic Mexican and gives a slight feel of Mexico. Their menu is plentiful with choices and everything can be modified to your own tastes. Be sure to have some nopalito in your burrito!!! Employees are super friendly and always happy! Burritos are big and one is almost too much for one person. This is my go to place for burritos!!!!
