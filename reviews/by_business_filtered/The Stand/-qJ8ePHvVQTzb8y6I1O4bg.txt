A friend took me here for lunch.

Smallish burger joint with indoor and outdoor seating.  Not much room indoors - we ate outside - it's shady and has a fan.

Ordered the burger, a lemonade and fries.

I really wish I took a picture of the platter we were served - it looked delicious!

The burger was excellent - they are all 2 patties.  Tasted excellent - wasn't dripping in grease or sauce.  Very enjoyable.

The fries are cooked fresh and are thin sliced - but not too crispy.

The service is EXCELLENT.  They came out and refilled out drinks.

I HIGHLY recommend!!!!
