Two of my favorite things in one spot, tacos and burgers, it's a dream come true! The burgers are so juicy and the melted cheese makes for a savory taste bud explosion with every bite. Their fries are crispy, golden, and salty just the way I like em, don't forget to order the fry dipping sauce because it's so yummy!! 

Now I've only had a bite of one of their tacos and I remember enjoying it very much! I just love their burgers so much I haven't been able to deviate from ordering that. 

On to my absolute favorite part of The Stand experience...their milkshakes. Oh. My. Goodness. The Banana Stand and the Salted Dulce de Leche milkshakes are to die for!!! They are SO creamy and honestly the best milkshakes I've ever had the pleasure of sucking down. Once you start, you won't put it down until it gone. 

Their staff is very friendly and the owner has been on site every time I have visited. He has made my boyfriend and mines visit feel extra welcome. I can't wait to go back!

Last to note, the prices are super reasonable!
