Wow the Salted Carmel Milkshake alone is worth stop alone.. THE STAND is awesome. Not a huge menu but what that have on it is done correctly... 

i've enjoyed the fries, cheeseburger and short rib taco and was beyond pleased with my food. But the milkshakes are the ROCKSTAR of the burger stand...

I advise you to check it out and give those tastebuds some pleasure.
