It's ok. The food is good. A little expensive for what it is. The menu is not very big so I've had everything on there I think. I usually spend more than $10 for what is essentially a fast food meal. I tried the drive through once, which took about 45 minutes to get some of my food. The rest was acquired after they realized I was still there after they shut the window on me. It wasn't busy, maybe not a typical experience, but definitely unacceptable. 

3 stars for good food. Missing the other 2 for bad service and a little overpriced.
