I'm a loyal, happy customer. If I could give a 4.5 I would do that. The food is great. The service is hit and miss, but for the most part pretty good. I work down the street and frequently grab food from the drive thru. The last lady at the drive thru seemed a little out of it, maybe she was new, or the AZ heat was getting to her (and it would be helpful to give napkins out at the drive-thru please!) Tacos are delicious, only a couple bucks, and pretty filling! Get the short rib tacos- my fav! The Standard burger always tastes fresh. They gladly make it by less as well, but the buns are pretty tasty. If you go in the evening or lunch time, when they are really busy don't expect to get out of there very quickly. I went after work to pick up food to go for my family and it took about 30-45 minutes for the food to come out. They could definitely use more space.
