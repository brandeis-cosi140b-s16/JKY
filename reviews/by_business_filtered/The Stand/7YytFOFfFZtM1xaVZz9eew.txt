I'm a burger guy and I got yo say that this place makes some of the best burgers in town. The juicy flavorful patty between two fresh baked buns topped with FRESH ingredients will have you floored and satisfied. I cannot stress enough about how FRESH the ingredients are. Including the lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, beef, buns, jalapeño, and even condiments. Each bite was so good. Very juicy. Perfectly seasoned. And again you can't help buy acknowledge the superior fresh ingredients. Their delicious fries pair nicely. They have homemade horchata which I didn't try. But I did try their carne asada tacos and I was impressed. 

Overall a great little find. If your a burger connoisseur like myself, I recommend giving this place a visit. Order it to go and pair it with an Arrogant Bastard. If you add a little bit of a kick to the burger like Tapatio, or if you added jalapeños, Arrogant Bastard will definitely react nicely with the spicy tones and of course the after taste will mix nicely together with the seasonings. And because of the fresh ingredients you'll be able to go back and forth between beer and burger while enjoying the zesty fries.
