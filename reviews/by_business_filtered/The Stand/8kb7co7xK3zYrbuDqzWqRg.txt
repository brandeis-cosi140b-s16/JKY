This is a great burger spot. Cheap, quality, tasty, quick, has a drive through, the stand sauce is out of this world. I give it four stars because the French fries are mediocre. It can get busy and take some time and the staff is young and sometimes not the most efficient. But, the food is great. The short rib tacos are fantastic and they have a drink called horchata that is superb.

It's very casual, borderline fast food--but really yummy. I recommend it for sure.
