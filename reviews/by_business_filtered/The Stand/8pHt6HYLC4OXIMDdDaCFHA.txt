Just came here for a post workout meal and it was delicious. I had a burger which was amazing. It was the classic burger without all the extra grease. My husband tried all 3 tacos (and so did I) and we liked all of them. Everyone around us was getting shakes and I was jealous. Next time I will be getting one!!  Super friendly staff too :)
