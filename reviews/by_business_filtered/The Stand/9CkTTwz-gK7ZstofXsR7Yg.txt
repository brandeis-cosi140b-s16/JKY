Order in, drive through this place is the go to in Arcadia for a great burger (ok I didn't mean to make that rhyme).  They "get" great customer service and always ask for my name when I order even in the drive through.

I haven't had a chance to try a shake yet mostly because I save my calories for a Standard with Cheese and fries.  They are also always happy to modify my burger as I am not a lettuce, tomato, onion fan.

Only gripe is they use a lot of pepper on both the burger and on the fries.  I like well seasoned but the beef is amazing and flavorful so no need to add anything else.  Same with the fries, salt is all you need!
