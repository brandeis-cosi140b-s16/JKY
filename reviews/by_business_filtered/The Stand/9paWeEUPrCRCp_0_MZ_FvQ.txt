This place is AWESOME.  The menu is pretty short and simple, which doesn't matter because the food is amazing!!! I always order the veggie tacos (best I've ever had), fries with stand sauce (sauce is really good) and the Salted Carmel Dulche De Leche shake which is sooooo yummy. I highly recommend every one try that shake.
