My fiance' turned me on to this place when he brought home their "Standard With Cheese" burgers and hand cut french fries with "Stand Sauce" for dipping. The flavors are wonderful and have an original trademarked taste, unlike the other "same ol' same" burger joints I have tried. Their serving sizes are some what large and for one person, very filling. Since my first try, we have visited the drive through on various evenings. The staff here are fun and full of energy. Each time my fiance' orders his usual "Sprite with no ice", their response is "Ok, a Sprite with extra, extra ice? Got it!" I have a huge appreciation for this enthusiastic customer service, as I worked in the restaraunt feild for years, myself. My reasoning for the 4 star review is because I've yet to explore their menu, and they've got plenty competition. Entirely my fault, for this is a fantastic, enthusiastic, fun local burger joint!
