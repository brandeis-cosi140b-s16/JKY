One of my favorite local burger shops! The burgers are great! The stand sauce makes them exceptional! It's also a great dipping sauce for the fries. Not really a fan of their tacos but the burgers make up for it! The shakes are really delicious and flavorful as well. The service has always been great! The people working there are really friendly and my food has always come out speedy! I've gotten quite a few friends to become stand "regulars" since I've brought them here!
