If I'd stumbled over this burger stand, which appears to have crossed the temporal barrier from a 1960s where Phoenix was much more sophisticated, on my own, I'd be having a five-star rave over how it's the most amazing thing ever.

Having had it recommended as the most amazing thing ever by a foodie web site, I'm feeling distinctly three-star-ish. So split the difference, as the place is well-intentioned in a flustered way, and neighborhoods need good hamburger joints.

Certainly, it was the best-smelling burger in recent memory. You get two thin, seared patties that are most definitely well-done. Any juiciness comes from the Russian dressing, the tomato, and really first-rate pickles. The fries were workmanlike, if lukewarm. When twilight falls and the Muzak plays Pink Floyd, you will eat the fries anyway.

Y'know... same price as fast food, hipster ambience... I'd eat here again simply because you don't find yourself soaked in grease and self-loathing at the end of the meal.
