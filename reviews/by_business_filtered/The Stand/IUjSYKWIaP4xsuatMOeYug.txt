After my friend Zak helped me with a ride from the airport I offered him a meal to pay him back. Which is how we ended up at The Stand. After pondering whether to get a burger or Mexican I decided to get the cheeseburger with grilled onions and fries.

The fries were pretty great and are a step or two above your In N Out style fries. The burger on the other hand was a bit of a letdown. It was strange because it looked like a great burger and had all the elements needed to be amazing but in the end..... the taste kinda fell flat. 

+ Toasted Bun
+ Lotta Juice

- Sauce didn't really add anything 
- Burger became a heavy tasting slog towards the finish line

What was more interesting to me then the food was the interior and the bright blue walls of this place. Cool interior and concept that echoes the Echo Park area in LA but sadly the food execution wasn't there. It's the food that lumps it into the likes of 5 Guys, Smashburger, and The Habit of good - not great burger places.

Don't get me wrong eating here wasn't a bad experience; it just wasn't an exceptional one. (But come for the blue walls!)
