Decided to check out The Stand to satisfy a burger craving.
I appreciate how small and simple the menu is - do a few things, and do them well!
I ordered a burger, Mexican Street Corn (I guess they figure we don't know what "elote" is), and a short rib taco. 
Apparently, the elote is on backorder. The gal who appeared to be in charge told me the vendor didn't have any, but they should be getting some in Monday. I can only hope she just meant fresh corn and they really prepare the elote fresh there. It's simple enough - no reason to order it in pre-made and just heat it. I decided to order fries instead.
The place is super clean, and all of the staff is friendly and seem happy to be there. 
When receiving my order, I noticed the burger was falling out the bottom of the bag. Not only were they quick to apologize and give me a new (double) bag - they added in a second order of fries since it seems I lost some to the first bag. While I appreciate the customer service there, and felt they were really on point - the last thing I need is a second order of fries. Had I been paying more attention, I would have thanked them but refused.
The short rib taco is well executed, but about $1.00 too high. I am spoiled by plenty of close and solid taco options - for $3.00, a tiny street taco better be a revelation. It was good - but certainly not amazing. Beef, cilantro, pickled onion and cotija. Tasty, but not a great value.
The fries are quite good - but not fantastic.
And the burger was meh. Nothing wrong with it. The patties were seasoned, bun and veggies fresh - but nothing stellar or phenomenal about it.
I'd put the quality up there with 5 Guys and Habit - and of the three, will support the small, local one.
So yes, I am sure I will be back - there was nothing wrong with it and the staff are a treat to deal with. I just wasn't "wowed."
