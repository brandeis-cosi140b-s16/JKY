Great burgers and fries. Dolce milkshake is off the charts.  Be prepared to wait in the drive-thru line as this is not fast food, its made to order.

Met Miranda one of the managers and she was awesome, bringing my dogs treats in the line and offering to take my order from the parking lot so I didn't have to leave them in the car for a few minutes. Excellent service.

Will be a frequent visitor.
