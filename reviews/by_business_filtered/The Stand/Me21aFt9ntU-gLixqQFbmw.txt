Not the best burger I've ever had... but it was REALLY good!  I hit up The Stand for lunch and received quick, helpful service.  The girl at the counter made suggestions since I had never been there before... and she was spot on.  

I had a cheeseburger with bacon (because why would anyone ever order a burger without bacon???) and struggled to not gobble up the whole thing!

Note that the place is tiny (or as real estate agents would call it, "cozy").  And I mean, get to know your neighbor, because you may be sharing a table with someone who also is enjoying a delicious burger or tasty tacos.
