I had the glazed rib beef taco with pico de gallo and hot sauce also had a standard burger and fries with a sweet tea "with Splenda and sugar". First let me say this. The girl in the drive thru gave good customer service. So for that this restaurant passes in my book. The Burger was good, and acceptable. The fries were the best thing I got here. I would compare them to McDonald fries. But natural. Better than a lot of burger shops. Then comes the taco..eww it was sweet. I couldn't for the life of me figure out where the sweet juice was coming from. It was nasty. It was a bad attempt at Mexican food. Or whatever Kind of twist they were trying to create. Then the tea incident. I was given no sweetners for my tea. This was a negative. The food was notably clean. I would return.
