I have been here a few times now, and twice with a Deal Chicken. The tacos are okay if you're looking for a more upscale fast food taco. The burger is delicious. All the right toppings come together! One suggestion: I wished they would serve a single patty burger. Then I may be more likely to add fries or a shake. But after not being able to finish or truly enjoy either after eating the burger, I'm more likely to just get the burger in the future and call it a meal. Plus, I usually treat myself with a burger and don't eat them regularly, so one beef patty is enough to satisfy my craving.
