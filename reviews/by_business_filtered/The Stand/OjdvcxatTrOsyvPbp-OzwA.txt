Pretty solid burger/milkshake.   I did order 2 tacos (short rib and chicken) only to find out that once home they had given me just 2 veggie ones.  Even my meat lover brother in law enjoyed the veggie tacos and my daughter and I found the milk shake and burger good.  A little pricey, but overall tasty and a nice addition to Arcadia.
