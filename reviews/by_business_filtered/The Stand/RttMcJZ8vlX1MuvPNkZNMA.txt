Very simple and clean menu. This place specializes in a handful of items and them do them all very well. I had driven past here a million times and always wanted to go in and I regret waiting this long. I tried the cheese burger, chocolate shake, and fries. Each item was great. The shake was much better than most I have tried around town. The burger was fantastic! perfect ingredients and meat all served on a fresh bun (which might have been a Hawaiian bun). My only complaint would be that it took me 15 minutes to get through the drive thru even though there were only 2 cars ahead of mine.

I will definitely be back and go inside sometime!
