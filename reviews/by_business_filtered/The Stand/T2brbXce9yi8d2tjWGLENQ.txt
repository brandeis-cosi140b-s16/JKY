OMG! I thought I'd grab a Burger to eat at home. No doing. That Burger smelled so good I had to have a bite. I'm only a little ashamed to say I ate the whole thing before leaving the parking lot. It reminded me of burgers hot off the grill from a drive in I frequented as a teen. Now the burger is the only thing I've tried here so its all I can speak to. Its two freshly grilled patties (I order mine with cheese which was melted into the patty just right), set atop your ordinary bun with cool veggies and a sauce that gives it a juicyness, yummm! Its messy but so good. Only bad thing is I live around the corner! I see lots of cheeseburgers in my future.
