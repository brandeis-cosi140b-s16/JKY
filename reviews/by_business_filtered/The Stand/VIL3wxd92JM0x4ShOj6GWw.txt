I love it, my wife loves it and so do our kids.  The inside is a little small so you may have a wait at lunch or early evening but there is also a small patio in the front that is perfect when it's not summertime.  While the burger is pretty good, the tacos are great.  The staff and owners are also very friendly and the service is fast and good.
