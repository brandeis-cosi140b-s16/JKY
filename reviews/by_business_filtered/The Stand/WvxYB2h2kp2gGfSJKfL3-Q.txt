I'm definitely giving a 5 star review due to the service. 

We had our 1 cheat day and I was dead set on a greasy burger. So, we decided to try The Stand and get drive thru. 

However, when we got home, the bag broke open, spilling all of the food on the concrete parking spot. We were so bummed! I called the restaurant and spoke to the manager, Ron. This is where I'm floored. 

Ron drove all the way to where we live just to deliver a new set of burgers!! Are you kidding?!? That is AMAZING customer service and REALLY going above and beyond!!!!

Thank you so much for turning our night around!! 

Oh! And you really have to try these shakes. Wow.
