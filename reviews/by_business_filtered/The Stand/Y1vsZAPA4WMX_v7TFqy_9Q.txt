I decided to give this place a try, but unfortunately did not get a chance to partake. After waiting for 15 minutes in the drive-thru line that never moved (literally) I decided to call a spade a spade and left. At other "upscale" drive-thrus (see D'lish), if their drive-thru line is long, a staff member comes out to your car to take and/or deliver your order. The Stand could learn a thing or two about improving their customer service.
