Its like a good In-and-out burger and fries.  Its solid, just not mind-blowing and not as cheap.  And I do mean an In and out in California, not the crappy ones out here.

The tacos are tasty too, though I'm not sure I'd pay 3 bucks for a tiny, not-so-special taco again.  Really they should put 2 per order at that price for the size of these.  

They cram too much ice into their beverages too.  I love the ice (tiny cubes, mottled), but they displace so much of the liquid that you don't end up with enough.

They should also do something about the bathroom smell in that hallway when you walk in.
