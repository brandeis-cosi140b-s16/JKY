So, The Stand has ruined me -- or at least my reputation at work! I discovered this place a few weeks ago, and the short rib tacos with their sweet pickled cabbage has had me coming back multiple times... per week. Every time I leave my office at lunch, someone says, tacos? Yes, I admit it. I cannot stay away. The sweet and savory combo is deadly (to your diet). The burgers are good, too, and the shakes are just as thick and amazing as the Yelpers say. Definitely five stars.
