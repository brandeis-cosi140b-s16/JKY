Stopped in for Saturday lunch with my son. The place was fairly crowded. Although I think that there were more employees then there were customers. 

That said, we share a couple of tacos, a burger, and some fries. All were good. The burger is very much in line with In & Out, Five Guys, or The Habit. Not like what you get a Deluxe or The Grind. 

Nice decor, good service, and good food.
