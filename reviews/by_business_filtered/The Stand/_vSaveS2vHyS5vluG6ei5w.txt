Went here for the tacos and was underwhelmed. Good, but nothing special. What was special though was the shake! I had read some of the other reviews and was intrigued by the salted caramel shake. I ordered one and wow! Thick and smooth, not a common combo anymore. The caramel was great and the salted bits really added to the whole thing. I did have some guac and that was pretty good, again nothing super special but better than average. I didn't have the burgers so I can't speak to them. Overall, have a shake, they really are that good but there are better places for tacos
