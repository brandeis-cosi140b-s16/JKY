A quint hidden gem in the Phoenix area! Walking up, I did not expect much. It is very small and doesn't exactly have "curb appeal". After walking in my opinion changed quite fast. Very clean, and chic spot! The menu was very basic, but you can tell they'd rather focus on a few items, and do them well...and they did! Great service, and good food. No complaints, and will be returning!
