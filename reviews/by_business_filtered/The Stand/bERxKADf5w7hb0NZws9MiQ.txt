Dined in for lunch with a friend.  There's very limited seating but I managed to grab one of the booths thanks to fortunate timing (and a nice employee asked me if she could wipe it down too).  Limited parking too, but again I had good timing and someone backed out as I pulled in.  There was a pretty good sized group in line ahead of us (five people or so), but the cashier was competent.  The food was delivered pretty fast as well, and I appreciated how many people they had working behind the counter.

Standard burger: The two thinner patties together provided a lot of meat!  The taste was similar to In-n-Out or a meatier, firmer Sonic.  It was okay, but I don't love well-done beef.  Bun was fine, cheese seemed like standard American.

Fries: My generous buddy gave me some of his order of these.  They had a really great herb mix (very similar to Smash Burger's fries) sprinkled on top.  The fries themselves again reminded me of In-N-Out in their shape and texture.  I don't care for how small and greasy they are, and they only taste good when they are hot.  Not bad though, and the server was nice enough to bring extra ketchup (and a bigger water cup for me, which I was grateful for as theirs are ridiculously tiny).

Salted Caramel Shake: Amazing.  This was SO good!  I loved how salty it was.  It had generous ribbons of caramel that I scraped off the side of the cup with my straw afterwards.  It was just the right size, and I appreciated the extra wide, extra strong straw that could handle the thick shake.

Their pricing is very affordable at a solid fast-casual level (more than Sonic, WAY less than Ingo's and Zinburger).  Their pricing is actually HALF of what Zinburger charges for their more basic burgers!  With that in mind, I appreciate this place for what it is: A cheaper alternative to the "fancy burger" places, and a solid "better burger" restaurant.
