Much to my chagrin the wife wanted their tacos again. Went inside. Ordered. Then almost slipped a disk when I stumbled on the greasy floor. Asked the server to mop. She ignored me. Hailed the manager and asked him to mop and explained the floor was extremely greasy. Ignored. If your front lobby floor is THAT DIRTY, how does the kitchen look???????
