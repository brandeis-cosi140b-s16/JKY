What is the point of having a drive thru if it takes 45 minutes to get through a line of 5 cars. At this point I don't even care if the food is AMAZING... If I wanted to spend this much time waiting for my food, I would have gone to a sit down restaurant. The girl at the window did apologize for the wait... But even after I paid I waited another five minutes to get my food... The worst drive through experience I've ever had.
