The Stand is one of my new favorite go to grab and go restaurants. All of their food is high quality, tasty and fresh. Stand-outs are the burger with cheese and grilled jalapenos and the fries. They also make a mean Arnold Palmer. My only complaint is their chicken taco which I wanted to like but is a bit too bland.
