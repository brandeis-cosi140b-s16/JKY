Burger, Fries, Shake, and 1 taco = $17.74 and I wouldv'e paid more. Juiciest double stack perfectly cooked washed down with a consistantly textured flavorful shake and an authentic style short rib taco to boot. Try getting that at quality in any restaraunt in town. This is a restaraunt by the way and locally owned with fresh ingredients and no added hormones. If you want fast food go to McDonalds you cheap bastard.
