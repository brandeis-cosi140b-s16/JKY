The building is weird but I dig weird.  Not sure what the building was before but I think re-purposeing old buildings for new businesses is really cool.  

I went with a couple people and we tried to order almost everything they had.  I really liked the burger and shakes.  The biggest surprise was spare rib tacos.  I'm usually make boring food choices so I didn't expect to like them but they were really good.  When I go back I will order those.  

I see a lot people complaining about the service but I thought the service was very good.
