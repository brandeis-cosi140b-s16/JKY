Being a So. Cal native I like "street style tacos". I was a bit iffy on this place at first since it's tucked away. But opted to try it out as i was on a kick of trying new places around my office. I was completely surprised by this place. The short rib tacos are incredibly good as well as the chicken tacos. It's a very relaxed place to eat, nothing fancy on the inside and the patio seating offers a nice breeze. But the tacos are incredibly delicious. I wanted to try their street style corn but it was not in season. They put pickled cabbage on their tacos which was different, not a fan of pickled anything but my coworker thought it was great. Comes with cotija cheese and add the hot sauce with some lime... And it's a great tasting taco and inexpensive lunch. Great place, have eaten there a few times and it had become one of my regular spots.
