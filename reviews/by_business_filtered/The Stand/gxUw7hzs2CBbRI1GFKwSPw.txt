It's official. As of today, The Stand is my top burger joint in Phoenix. 

I stopped here on my first trip out to The Valley, and it's turned into a regular stop ever since I moved here. 

The burgers are perfect. They're not too heavy on the meat and not overwhelmed by toppings. There's a perfect balance happening between those buns. A bigger patty or more patties does Not mean a better burger. Someone should put out that memo. I've never had a dry burger here either. They're always tender and juicy. 

My verdict is still out on the fries, but I don't come here for the fries so it's kind of a non-issue for me. 

The shakes are great. I've had a plain vanilla a couple of times, and hear the dulce de leche is the cow's moo, so I'll be trying that at some point. 

If you're feeling Mexicany, the short rib tacos are good. I'm not well versed enough in taco to say how well they stack up against others in the area, but I liked them. The Mexican corn has also been a go-to. Very good. 

It's worth mentioning that the people that work here have always been friendly on my visits. At times I've experienced an almost sickening amount of smiley and bubbly here. That's not a bad thing. An aversion to overly happy people is my own cross to bear, and I won't take it out on them.

On the whole, when I think about it, the Stand is my top stop in Phoenix... period.
