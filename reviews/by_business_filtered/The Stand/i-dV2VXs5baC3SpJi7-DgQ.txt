The burgers, fries, milkshake and chicken tacos were very good.  The service though left a lot to be desired.  The food and drinks were delivered in waves.  The burgers and tacos were delivered, then minutes later the drinks, the milkshake eventually came, but no fries.  After going back up to the counter to tell them we didn't get our fries, they came long after the burgers and drinks were done.  If they could just get the timing down it would be an even better experience.
I hope they do well since they seemed like very nice people!
