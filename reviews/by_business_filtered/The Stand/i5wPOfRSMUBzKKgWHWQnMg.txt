I'm the hugest fan of lemonade and this place has some of the best!  Just be sure to say "light on the ice" or you'll have about 7 sips of lemonade and a ton of ice left.  I've also tried the veggie tacos which are very tasty, love the pickled onions on them.  The burger is also good and the bread tastes soft and fresh.  The fries are delicious and well seasoned.  Overall a great neighborhood spot and great for late night munchies.
