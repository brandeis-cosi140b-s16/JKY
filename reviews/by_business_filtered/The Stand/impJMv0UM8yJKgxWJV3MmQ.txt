Got into line for the drive thru at 1:32. Ordered two burgers, two shakes and one fry. Left with our food 27 minutes later. Got home (right around the corner) to enjoy what I thought was going to be a great burger. The bun was soggy like the tomato had been sitting on it all day. The patties didn't seem hot. The fries weren't cooked all the way through. The shakes were great though.
I can't believe it takes so long to make crappy burgers and fries. Not going back.
