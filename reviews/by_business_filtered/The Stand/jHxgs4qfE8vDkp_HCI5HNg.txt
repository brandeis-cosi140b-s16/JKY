I live around the corner from this place and I've been there several times. I've tried everything except the milkshakes and the veggie taco.

Burgers are pretty good if you are a fan of the in-and-out style of burger. I do wish they had a single patty option, as the double stack is pretty big. 

The short rib taco is better than the chicken, but I'm not the biggest fan of the pickled veggies on them. I just pick them off.

Fries and guacamole are great!

The chips are strange though. They use a different type of oil that I think is supposed to be healthier. Both times I've tried them all I can taste is that oil and it has a strong smell too. I always get take out and I can smell the chips in my kitchen for hours after they've been in there.

I have no real complaints. It is a good place if you are looking for a quick bite that's better than a traditional drive through. But be prepared to wait a little longer too. They make your food to order, so unless you want to spend a significant time in your car, I would skip the drive though if there is even a single car in line.
