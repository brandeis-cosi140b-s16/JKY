Be prepared to wait a long time in the drive through....I waited more than 20 minutes and two cars in front of me decided to go inside instead of waiting.  You cannot call your order in and pick it up.  If you could, that might eliminate quite a bit of the wait.

The burger was adequate and the fries very good but mine were not crispy at all.  The burger could have used a little more salt and a little more sauce and it would have been even better.  It was a fair amount for a fair price and it was hot and fresh.  The staff was friendly and efficient.  I'd go back again.
