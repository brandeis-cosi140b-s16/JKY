This place is amazing!!! Very friendly staff! The best short rib taco I have ever had! It's a must! The burger was good too just needed some jalape√±os. Tasty street corn! Chips and was was good too. Best for last the salted Carmel shake!!! I'll Definitely be back and recommend The Stand to family and friends. 5 stars
