Came here for lunch today and really enjoyed the burger here. The hamburger  patties were really juicy and the fries were really fresh. I love the simplicity of their menu, there isn't a lot of options, but everything they do offer tastes awesome. I enjoyed the customer service most of all. After I sat down from ordering, they bring the food to you instead of just yelling out your order number. They also checked up on me twice after that to ask if there was anything else I needed. Overall this little burger joint was a nice surprise to my day and I recommend you give it a try!
