OK, people: GLUTEN FREE HAMBURGER BUNS are available here! In fact, everything on the menu is completely gluten free except for the cheeseburger/hamburger with the regular bun. The staff members were very friendly and they also noted to me that they take great precautions to avoid cross contamination. They even asked if I have an allergy (which I do). The food was fabulous! I got the cheeseburger with the gluten free bun (obviously) and it was really good. I definitely couldn't stop eating it even though I was getting full. The fries were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The food was hot and did not take too long to arrive to our table. My mom got a cheeseburger with the regular bun and just pickles and tomato. They got it just right and my mom loved the food as well.The fresh squeezed lemon juice definitely sealed the deal. And they have a drive though! I will be back to try the tacos or maybe have another cheeseburger...we will see.
