This place has to be in consideration for best (reasonably priced) burger in the valley.  There's one burger on the menu, but man is it delicious.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned meat, fresh toppings and a great bun.

I also explored the chicken taco.  Reasonably priced, packed to the top with flavorful, perfectly slow cooked chicken, this taco is a must order.

The place was so good, I tried it one day, liked it so much, I went back the next day!
