The Stand did not disappoint, thank you again, fellow Yelpers! However, I was a bit disappointed (with myself) that I didn't order their famous Banana Hand-spun Shake to go with my Royale. Are you kidding me? I had room and wanted more! 

Well, I'll be back for THAT combo, as this will be a regular burger joint for this ex-in-n-out lover...adios to the drab and welcome, my new romance! Hey really, this is a simple double burger with just the right bacon, grilled jalopeneos and carmalized onions and the typical tomato and lettuce accoutrements. Had to try the hand-cut fries, of course, which made a great pairing; crunchy and flavorful, just how I like 'em. Was it typical? I'll find out soon enough.

Service was spot on, as I "dined in" outside, and the meal was brought to my table with a smile, and afterwards an offer for a free refill on the soda. Simple, Satisfying and Smooth!
