Cool little hole in the wall type place. Place looked clean with retro decor but with a modern flair.  That's the good part. 

I had a chicken taco and my sons each got a burger. The food is pricey for what you get.  The burgers were okay but certainly not worth over 5 bucks.  The taco had shredded chicken and pickled red onions which looked strange since they were a pinkish color. I got it with Pico.  The chicken was dry and the presentation did not look good with the pink onions.  The onions looked a bit like raw tuna. 

Overall, it was pricey for such mediocre food.   Much better places in town than this.
