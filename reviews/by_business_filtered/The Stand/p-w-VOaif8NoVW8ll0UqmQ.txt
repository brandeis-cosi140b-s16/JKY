As always, skip to the last paragraph if you want the quick review!

I've driven by this joint on the north side of Indian School Rd. more than once and today I had an opportunity to stop and check it out.  I was getting it to go, but went inside to see what the place was like, rather than use the drive thru window.
It is small, but what would you expect from a place called "The Stand".  I found it very clean and busy.  It was 12:30PM on a Monday.  There were three people ahead of me in line and a couple of people taking orders.  They moved us through pretty quickly.
I ordered a burger w/cheese, a short rib taco, vege taco and a chocolate shake.  This will end up being two meals for me, but I always like to try a few different things when I go someplace for the first time.
She asked if I wanted fries, I declined, she countered with "It's free fries Monday".  OK, I'll try the fries as well.
My order was ready in about 10 minutes.
The staff were friendly and you definitely got the feeling they were working hard to get things out as quickly as possible.
Despite the small menu, they have some good offerings for the masses.
I feel their pricing is fair.  The ingredients seemed to be of better than average quality, so I expect to pay a little more than average.

How does it go, do a few things and do them well.  Holds true at The Stand as far as I'm concerned.  The burger was reminiscent of old school In and Out, back when they were just in California, but just a touch better.  The shake was delicious, although could have been a touch smoother.  Fries were good as well.  If you like crispy fries, you'll probably want to request that when you order.  Vege taco was delicious.  Very well done.  Short rib taco was tasty too.  Will I go back? Yes, if I'm in the area and want a quick and tasty lunch!
