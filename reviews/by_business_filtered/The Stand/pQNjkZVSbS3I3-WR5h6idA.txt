I don't write too many reviews on here, mainly because I'm lazy... However I have to write a review for The Stand because I believe people should know how good it is. (And selfishly I want them to succeed so I can keep eating there.)

Starting with the design, clean, modern, minimalistic. The same approach was taken with the menu. Small, clean, and to the point.

Pricing - VERY reasonable for what you get.  

Tacos - So far I tried the short rib and the chicken. The short rib packs plenty of flavor and is very well balanced. The chicken was good for sure, I just feel like the short rib is where it's at. (A+ short rib) (B+ chicken) I may be bias on this one...

Burgers - Cheese or no cheese. Fancy toppings optional. I tried "The Standard" with cheese. Clean, simple, no bull shit all American burger. Topped with their signature "the stand sauce" reminds me of a homemade in n out burger. Tasty to the max. (A)

Fries - Handcut, Real potatoes fried golden and tossed with sea salt. Clean flavor with no greasy after taste. (A+)

Milkshake - Damn they're tasty. In fact, I will go on record saying it's the best I've ever had. I've tried the Banana and the Dulce de leche, both amazing and hand made. Bonus points to The Stand as well for being awesome and supplying a proper big ass straw for a thick shake. If nothing else it's worth the trip and soon to be long wait just for the shake. 

Summary - The Stand is not revolutionizing the world in how crazy they can get with their menu by putting over thought shit on there. Instead they took good food and made it better. I can say that after being to most of the burger spots in Arcadia and the Biltmore area that The Stand is one of the best. 

P.S. - to anyone who may question this review I want to make it clear that I am in no way affiliated with The Stand either personally or through business. I just happen to think it's really good.
