Yum! My husband and I tried The Stand for the first time tonight. My husband got a burger and I got two chicken tacos. We split a side of fries with stand sauce. The tacos were so simple but so good! I loved the pickled onion and the chicken was so flavorful. The fries were some of my favorite fries we have ever had. The sauce with them was awesome! My husband loved his burger. He loved the two patties, fresh tomato, thick bacon and the stand sauce was great on the burger too! We ended the meal with the dulce de leche shake! It was so good! The extra Carmel drizzle was delicious! Can't wait to go back! We just wish it was closer! Only thing this place needs is more seating inside.
