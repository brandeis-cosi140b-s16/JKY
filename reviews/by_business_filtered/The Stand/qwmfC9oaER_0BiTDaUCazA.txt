Looks like "the Stand" downsized their tacos in a big way. The wedge of lime is almost as big as the tacos itself and then we have the inside of the beef taco which hardly contained any short rib at all. The tacos were good, but not worth $3.00 each, maybe for two, but they have to make a profit somewhere. Look at the other photos and then my tacos - hardly any meat and it took 12 minutes to make two of them when it was only mildly busy. The veggie taco was decent as well, but put some more veggies in there please. Salsa was fresh and full of good ingredients and corn tortillas also seemed freshly prepared. I suppose this could be considered a light lunch, but you will have to add chips or another side for a meal.
