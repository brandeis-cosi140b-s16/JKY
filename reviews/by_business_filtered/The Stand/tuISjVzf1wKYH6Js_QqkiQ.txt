Ordered the burger with cheese, onions and bacon and some fries. The fries were ok, they unfortunately get soggy in the bag extremely quickly but they taste good. I'm sure they're much better if you're dining in and they don't have a chance to get steamed in the bag on the way home. The burger was excellent. When I pulled it out of the bag, it didn't look like much but it tasted great and the ingredients looked very good. The burger alone is easily worth going back.
