I had a very mixed experience at The Stand. The burger and fries were good. The chocolate shake was divine: rich and creamy. The drive-thru was horrible. It took us at least 30 minutes to order and get our food when there were only four cars in front of us. i can understand how drive-thrus can get backed up. It happens. All the worker had to do was apologize for the wait when we got our food. We complained about the wait and we got a half hearted apology. I would like to go back because the food is good and I want to support a local business. My only hesitation is the long wait. It is hard to wait that long in a drive- thru.
