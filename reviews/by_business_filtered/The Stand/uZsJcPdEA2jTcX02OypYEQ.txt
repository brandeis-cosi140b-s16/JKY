Seriously so delicious! I had the short rib tacos and they were phenomenal. On top of my delicious food, the customer service was top notch. The wait time is only slightly longer than your typical drive-thru, but considering the quality of the food and the over all experience, I would have waited as long as they needed me to! The only negative is that I have lived in AZ for almost 3 years and this was my first time going! I will most definitely be back.
