Yummooo! This place is simple and delicious! The chicken taco, and veggie taco were delicious! I wasn't to fond of the pork. Hubby had the burger which he raved about and the fries were tasty! We also had the banana shake which was yum!  The staff was super friendly, the place is clean and seemed to be well organised!  The pricing is decent as well! Would definitely go back!
