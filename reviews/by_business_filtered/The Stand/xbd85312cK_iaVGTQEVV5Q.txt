Best non-chain drive thru burgers in Phoenix.  Best fast-food burgers in town also.  They claim all meet is ground and formed daily... it tasted like it too.

Went on a busy Sunday evening, the service was very friendly and fast.

Cons:  My fries were to salty otherwise they would have been great.  I asked for no pickles but they left them all.. not a big deal but would have been nice  not to dig thru it.  
I had the standard no cheese, plus butter sauteed onions and grilled peppers.  a Side of sauce for the fries.  I'd definitely go back next time I crave a quick burger.  Nice to finally see something succeed in that location. 

Glad they have real hours unlike most  lazy joints in Phoenix, hence the busy Sunday evening.
