Tiny little place. Went on a Friday during lunch and it was pretty busy but still managed to find a seat. Delicious burgers and fries juts super classic and delicious. They also have homemade juices and such. 

Tip: this restaurant ONLY has burgers and tacos.

but they are GOOD. Prices are a bit high for it to be a cheap grab a quick bite type of place
