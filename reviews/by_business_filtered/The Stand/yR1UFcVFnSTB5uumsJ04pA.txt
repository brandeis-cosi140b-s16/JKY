Came in for lunch with friends and my 2 little girls.   Ordered 3 short rib tacos.   However, I only ate 2 since one of my friends was like "I can believe you didn't order a burger."  As a result, I didn't eat the 3 rd taco and got up and ordered a Burger.  I'm happy I did.  It was flat out fantastic and Im a stickler for a good burger.  Not that the short rib taco was great.   I could of easily ate all 3 as they were great too.   Next time I go in there, I'm ordering a burger and 1 short rib taco.    This place is fantastic, and a wonderful bang for the buck.     Don't miss out on the shake either, (which i ordered for my little girls).   I almost sucked all theirs down.   One of the best chocolate shakes ever.   Next time you are in the area, drop in to The Stand and give it a try.   Nothing fancy, but no need to be.   They know what they are doing with the few items on the menu.    I could see them throwing in a special every now and then to mix things up or too try something different .   Overall,   this  place is a great place to eat.
