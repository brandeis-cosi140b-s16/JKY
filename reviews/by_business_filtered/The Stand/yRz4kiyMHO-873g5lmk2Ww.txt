So I have been back 2 times since my first review.  I tried the tacos, I tried the Chips and Guac and I tried the Dulce De Leche Shake

Tacos are decent - Chicken nothing to write home about, short ribs were good
Chips and Guac were good, but not on the level of chipotle

Dulce De Leche shake was awesome.  Very very tasty.

In other words I wont be coming back here for the food.  I will come back for a shake.
