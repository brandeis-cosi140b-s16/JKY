Great tacos, good burgers, and amazing fries (when they are not cold and limp).  My family really likes The Stand and we go there often.  My only complaint is that sometimes the fries are done right and sometimes they are not.  When they are done right, I crave them often!  The milk shakes are also really great. My favorite is the banana-which is not a typical flavor but has just the right amount of banana flavor to be refreshing but not over powering.
