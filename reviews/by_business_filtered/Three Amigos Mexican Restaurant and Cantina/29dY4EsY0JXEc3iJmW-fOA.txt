Great place for a decent mexican meal.  Went there with the Google offer coupon wondering if would be ok and it was good.  The chips and salsa are pretty good - the chips have some kind of seasoning on them I've never seen at a mexican restaurant but the were delicious.  The food was good as well, definitely not amazing by any means but very functional for that cheesy hangover cure I tend to get a craving for time and again.  Specials seemed pretty good too - $2 corona's on sundays and $2.50 on Mondays. They even have an all you can eat enchilada day during the week along with more pretty awesome drink specials.  All in all its a good restaurant with good food, if you want amazingly good mexican go somewhere like cantina or something like that.  If you want a good meal at a good price made by authentic mexican people you can't go wrong with Three Amigos.
