Tried out Three Amigos 3 times now. Never had to wait, the service is quick and the food is a dream. I'm the type that's NEVER in the mood for Mexican, but I guess I hadn't had the real deal yet. The shrimp, steak and chicky fajitas are my go to and ya girl cannot steer away!

Also, the margaritas on the rocks are well worth the $10. Large enough for two, but fun for one!
