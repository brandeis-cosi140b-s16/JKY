Have to do a quick update for my favorite Mexican spot in the city. Dalton, and the crew at Three Amigos offered to host my company holiday party this past Saturday night. All I have to say is Three Amigos continues to impress.
Out of 13 people, my wife and I were the only ones who had ever been here so I was very excited to show my co-workers some great, authentic food. 
We arranged to be served family style for such a big group and everything was perfect.
Started with pitchers of margaritas, a few beers, chips, salsa, queso fondito (chorizo & onion) and their incredible guac. 
I had asked specifically if they would make us some empanadas off of the late night Dominican menu and boy am I glad I did. They came out next, stuffed with either chicken or beef, they were incredible. 
Then came huge platters of rice and beans, followed by enchiladas served with either rojo, verde, or mole sauce. All 3 were incredible. Also served was Bistec ala Mexicana, which is basically a Mexican beef dish, served in a sauce of tomato, onions, chili, and a few other veggies. That stuff was amazing!!
They finished up with desserts from a local Mexican bakery, Las Delicias, (which will be reviewed as well).  We had a full Tres Leches cake, flan, and guava empanadas. 
The staff was amazing, and very accommodating, especially considering we got a little loud towards the end of the night. (Patron shots will do that to ya)

Big thanks to everyone at Three Amigos, you have forever won me and many of my co-workers over for best Mexican in the city.
