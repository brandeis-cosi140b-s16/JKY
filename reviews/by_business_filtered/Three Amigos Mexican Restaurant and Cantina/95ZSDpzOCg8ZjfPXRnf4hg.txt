What a gem we happened to stumble upon while escaping the incense filled interior of the pho place across the street. I often lament the lack of good Mexican food in Charlotte, but no longer. 

Veggie chimichanga was filled with diced zucchini, onions and peppers. Perfectly fried and topped with cheese sauce and a salad of lettuce, tomato and avocado. So filling I could only eat half. 

Husband had the carne asada and said it was the best he'd ever had. High praise from an extremely critical foodie. It was thinly sliced, seasoned and tender. 

The salsa is good but the cheese dip disappointed. Thick and flavorless and cold. After reading the reviews, I realized I should have gotten the queso fundido. Next time...
