A no-nonsense joint that (Mexi)can deliver exactly what you need without the fluff and cost of more fancy places.

The margaritas are strong, flavorful, and tangy. Not the best I've ever had (that would be Tommy's in San Francisco), but it can hold its own.

I got the chicken fajitas and must say, they rocked my world. You might be thinking that any old sizzling hot skillet containing onions, bell peppers, tomatoes and perfectly cooked chicken is fully capable of making your grandmother blush; however, where Three Amigos triumphs is the seasonings that really made it stand out--strongly peppered, but with a little more complexity that tasted just as good the next day. 

I will be returning again soon
