Delicious! They only serve lime margaritas but they are fresh and amazing. The pico, guacamole and fresh salsa paired with their freshly made chips easily make this one of the best Mexican Restaurants in Charlotte. 

The staff was attentive and the atmosphere was very chill. Great for families and date nights.
