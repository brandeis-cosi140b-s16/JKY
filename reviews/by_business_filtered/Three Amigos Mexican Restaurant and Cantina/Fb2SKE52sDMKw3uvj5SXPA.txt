Why, oh why, did it take me so long?

I pride myself in my love for good food and diversity of samples.  I'm embarassed it took me this long to visit this staple.  One Monday at work, a coworker told me I had to go to Three Amigos because it is the best in Charlotte.  I jumped on Yelp and saw Benjamin G's great review as well - I knew time was of the essence!

My bride and I went on Fat Tuesday to take in all it had to offer and I couldn't be happier.  I've found my new Mexican joint!  Excellent margaritas that are reasonably priced.  Anytime I can get a 8-9 dollar margarita with 1800 tequila, I'm a happy man.  We shared chips/salsa + chorizo cheese dip.  She had the tacos and I sampled the 4 sample enchildas.  

I can't wait to return and will definitely do so.  If you love fresh mexican food at great pricing, swing in.  You won't be sorry.
