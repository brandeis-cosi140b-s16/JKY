Oh man. Three Amigos, you stealer of hearts and filler of bellies. Every time we go, we wonder - why don't we eat here EVERY MEAL? 

I wish I could say I've tried everything on the menu and loved it, but the truth is we always order the enchiladas. Always. And we are never, *ever* disappointed. When's the last time you honestly said that about, well, anything?

Go. Go NOW. 

Just don't take my parking spot.
