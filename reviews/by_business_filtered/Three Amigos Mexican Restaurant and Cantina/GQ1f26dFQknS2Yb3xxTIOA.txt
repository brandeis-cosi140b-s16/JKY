Dropped in here on a big ole' Unofficial Yelper Field Trip to conduct a little reconnaissance on the current state of affairs of this little restaurant that could.  After sampling the wares, Three Amigos needs to change its name 'cause it just gained a new friend.

Started things off with a trio of salsa/dips and some lightly seasoned tortilla chips.  While even the red salsa was nicely done, the real stars were the tomatillo sauce and especially the green sauce blend of jalapenos and avocados.  This alone sets Amigos apart from the rest of the Mexican fare pact in town.

Also got to try the guacamole.  Nice and smooth, with a good blend of flavors, though I'd like it to have a little more kick with the spiciness.  Best part of all, a nice-sized boat of guac clocks in at just $3.75.  That's less than half the price of fancier places that mix it at your table- and as far as I'm concerned, I'll do without the show where the flavors are so good.

Entrees all looked good, but I tried out their pure vegan fare, and many props to them for giving this a go.  I had a trio of tostadas with beans, zucchini, and still more veggies.  I now know it is totally possible to eat Mexican without the cheese and sour cream.  Veggie fajitas and enchiladas verdes are also available in both a vegan and a vegetarian variety, though not listed as such on the menu- just ask the staff.

Loved the friendly atmosphere here from the waitresses right over to the manager, who checked in on us several times.  Also loved the fact the there is a mix of Latinos and gringos who stop in to dine here- a good sign you have come to the right place for serious eats.

By the way, if you are jonesin' for some authentic street food late at night, Three Amigos recently launced a late-night menu from 10 PM till 4 AM on Fridays and Saturdays.  Empanadas, chimi-churris and quipe.  Sounds like it's time for another reconnaissance mission- late-night style!
