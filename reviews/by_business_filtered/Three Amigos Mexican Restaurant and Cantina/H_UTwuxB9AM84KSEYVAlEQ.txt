OMG, it's no wonder this place is packed during prime hours.  The food is literally the best Mexican I've tried thus far.  I used to think Azteca held the crown but the power has swung full swing into Three Amigos' hands!  

Reading the reviews I too had to try the margaritas.....delicious!  I had the enchiladas (came with 3) for my main meal and it was equally divine.

Important to know about this place is, yes it's campy inside, yes it's crowded but believe me it's worth it!
