Two words: Super. Yum. Three Amigos is consistently good, fast and friendly. I love that it is open after midnight (shocking here in Charlotte where the concept of late night food seems to be lost on the restaurants). I love love love the enchiladas. Overall, I'd recommend dining here very highly. Gets minus one star only because I've had a few very mediocre take-out experiences(i.e. cold food, wrong order, small portions), but no one is perfect.
