I really enjoy the food here and consider myself a regular. My very favorite item on the menu is the margaritas! They are the perfect blend of tart and sweet with the smokey tequila taste in the background. Delicious!  The enchiladas are to die for and I also like the fajitas. The service is good, even on busy nights. This place got 5 stars because they really have the best authentic ingredients that I look for when craving Mexican food. I have yet to find another eatery that can compare to Amigo's mole and chili sauces. Well Done!
