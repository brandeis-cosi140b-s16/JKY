Y'all - this place has the BEST Mexican food in CLT. It's authentic, fresh and full of flavor. Their mole sauce and margaritas are to die for. Sometimes the food takes a little long to come out but the taste is well worth it! Be prepared to eat way too much because the portion sizes are more than plenty. Seriously, don't let the sketchy looking shopping center fool you, this place is a Plaza Midwood GEM!
