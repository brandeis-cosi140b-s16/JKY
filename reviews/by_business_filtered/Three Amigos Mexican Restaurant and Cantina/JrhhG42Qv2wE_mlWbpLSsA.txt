CRAZY good food, drink specials, not cheap on giving you a TON of queso with your meals/apps, and the chicken nachos are INSANE!!!...Seriously, picture a serving plate for Thankgiving with a nice big turkey on it; thats the size of the chicken nachos u get, loaded with white chunk chicken, cheese and everything else you'd want PLUS big slices of fresh avocado..For $7!  I'm a big dude and i can only eat 1/2 of it and take a shitload home. Staff has always been friendly and tho not speedy fast not as slow as some here indicate (seriously have you ever had lightening service at a mexican restaurant consistantly? If you've ever been to Mexico the pace is just a little slower than here and i think that feeds over)....I'd give it 7 stars if i could!!
