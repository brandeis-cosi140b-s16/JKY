Best Mexican I have ever had. I drive trucks all over the country, including to the edge of the US-Mexican border, and this is by far the best I've had.

A good measure of this place is to taste their refried beans - wow! I had a burrito last time I went and am craving another visit to have one again. 

They also have plantains. They're super delicious and would be a perfect desert if I didn't prefer having them as an appetizer. I didn't see them on the menu last time, but be sure to ask for an order, they're still available. 

As soon as I get back in town I'm heading there!
