Damn you Three Amigos...I knew it would happen if I saw you, but still I had to try. Replay 1 hour before dinner decision... 

Wife...let's have Mexican tonight. 
Me...Eh. 
Wife...What? Three Amigo's is good and cheap. 
Me...yeah, but I always overeat at Mexican restaurants 
Wife...So don't eat everything on your plate 
Me...I can't help myself, I've tried. Those damn combos kill me. 
Wife...laughs...you have a problem 
Me...at least I admit it 

1 hour 28 minutes later, I'm full after chips & quac (good guac!) and my chimichanga "combo". So good...so much food...and only $8. Add in a large margarita and bottle of beer and I am full. Yep...did it again. I left some rice and beans for whoever took my plate though. 

Three Amigo's is a great spot in Plaza that has a few small tables and a wall of booths. Don't be afraid of the so-so strip mall exterior, this place has great cheap food. It's also open until 4am on Friday & Saturday's. Good lord, if I'm there that late I know I won't have any room left from the night's PBR's, but as I know, I'll still stuff my face with good Mexican food. Damn you Three Amigo's! :)
