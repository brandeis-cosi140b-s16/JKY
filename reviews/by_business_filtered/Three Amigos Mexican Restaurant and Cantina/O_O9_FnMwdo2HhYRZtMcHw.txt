A week ago, the boy and I dropped in for a late lunch after a trip to Discovery Place. The restaurant was packed, so we waited about 10 minutes for our table.

With a Groupon in tow, we started with the guacamole. It was really good, but I like mine a bit spicier. He ordered a taco al pastor and a pollo gordita and I had the enchiladas verdes. He loved the taco and I had a bite of the gordita, deciding to order one for sure the next time.

I was happily surprised that my enchiladas were topped with queso fresco, crema, sliced avocado, and shredded lettuce, just as they would have been served in Mexico. The rice and beans were great, especially the beans (super creamy, just like my mom's!) 

For dessert, we shared the tres leches. I've been cutting back on sweets, so it tasted very sweet to me at first. But, after bite number three, I was in tres leches heaven. 

Service was a bit slow, but we weren't in a hurry, so we didn't really mind. I'm very happy to add Three Amigos to my short list of crave-able authentic Mexican restaurants the QC area (La Unica in Indian Trial and Don Pedro's in Pineville are the other two if you're wondering).
