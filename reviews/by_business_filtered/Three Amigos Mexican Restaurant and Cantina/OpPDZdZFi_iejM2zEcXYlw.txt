When we got here for dinner, as is the case with most Mexican restaurants, we were given the chips and salsa. Some chips had a red paprika seasoning, some had what looked like black pepper and some were plain. The salsa was amazing! We got the chicken empanada which was extremely delicious and full of flavor. I ordered the shrimp soft taco combo and my boyfriend ordered the tostada and enchilada combo. His food was great, but I forgot to tell them I didn't want sour cream on my tacos and didn't realize it till my order arrived -- not a big deal, I just scraped the sour cream off but my tacos still tasted like something was amiss even after adding some of the hot sauce. My wonderful boyfriend poured some of the salsa left over from the chips and voila my shrimp tacos were perfect!
I was also quite impressed with the service. Although our server took longer than normal to come to our table to take our order, she was very pleasant, polite, and attentive.
