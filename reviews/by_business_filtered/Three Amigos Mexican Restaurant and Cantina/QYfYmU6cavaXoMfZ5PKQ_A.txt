After reading all the wonderful reviews about this place, we were really excited to check it out. We walked right in, had a seat and places our order- simple menu items for a group if 4. We waited 45 minutes for our food, with empty glasses and no attention until 30 minutes in. We watched many tables who came in after us get their food before us, as our order was blamed on "a lot of take out orders". Finally got the food, chicken had no flavor, beans were mediocre, there was an overall lack of flavor. I will not be rushing back there any time in the near future.
