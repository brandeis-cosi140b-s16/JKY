I'm definitely a fan of 3 amigos!  They were completely empty on a Saturday afternoon so I got to sample sauces prior to placing my order which was very helpful as I am very indecisive by nature:-)  The chips and salsa were delish and the queso dip was amazing!  I finally decided on the Enchiladas Verde with chicken and steak(the steak is much better than the chicken imo).  The portions are quite large, so expect to feel like a stuffed pig as I did upon departure.
