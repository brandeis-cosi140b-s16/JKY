Sign currently says Three Amigos.  I've been here twice and enjoyed both times.  It is super cheap and delicious.  The wait staff is very friendly and attentive.  I love the guacamole.

Warning that you may be turned off by the shadiness of the strip-mall center when you pull up, but you must power through and go inside.  Once you get your chips and salsa you will be just fine!
