This place is FOR SURE worth a shot!  Nestled in a somewhat sketch plaza down Central a bit, you may miss it if you're not paying attention!  I actually found it via other Yelpers.  Always drink specials and food specials most nights!  All-you-can-eat Enchiladas on Thursdays.  Very well priced.  $13.50 for mixed grill fajitas- nice sized shrimp, chicken and steak!!!  Very generous portions... My roommate and I shared one meal after discovering the big quantities on our first visit!  We stopped in the first time on a Saturday night.... FREE Bingo starting at 9:30pm!!!  We won gift cards and free "Three Amigos" shot glasses!  Yum chips and salsa, $2 tacos EVERYDAY!!!  Great, affordable Mexican food!
