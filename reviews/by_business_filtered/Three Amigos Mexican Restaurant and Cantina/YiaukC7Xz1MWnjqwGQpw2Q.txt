I went here again to give this place another try well two years later to be exact and I can tell that this place has really stepped their game up. I was quickly seated the chips were piping hot and the salsa was tasty. I ordered the vegetarian chimichanga  a la carte and it was simply out of this world and pure bliss not to mention it was priced reasonably and very filling!!!
