Good food, but service was slow. We arrived as a bunch if tables were turning over, so I thinks tickets got mixed up in the kitchen. At least two groups who were seated after us were served & finished eating before we got our meals. Our server was attentive in keeping our chips, salsa, and drinks refreshed. She apologized for the delay and noted the manager was in the kitchen cooking to help catch up the backlog. I will return for the food, but hope for a better orchestrated service.
