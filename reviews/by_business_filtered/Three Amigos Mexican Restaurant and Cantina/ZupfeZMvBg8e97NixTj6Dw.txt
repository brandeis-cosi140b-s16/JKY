I've decided that every return trip to Charlotte should be marked by a visit to Three Amigos. This place is a legit little Mexican cantina on Central with solid food and quite good drinks.

I tend to avoid giant Margaritas (bad tequila experiences in my youth) but they're serving up some good ones here that are definitely a must-have. 

As for the food i'm definitely a fan of the Enchiladas; particularly the Enchiladas Rojas which have just the right amount of spice without being completely overwhelmed by tortilla and beans like at many Mexican spots. 

The service has been hit and miss. The staff are very nice but they tend to disappear for a bit after you've gotten your food (I'm still waiting on my water).

All in all this is a great little place and all the positive reviews are not far off.
