La Casa de Las Enchiladas is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Charlotte. I really like the steak burrito, which comes covered in queso sauce. You can try to order takeout, but it doesn't really work out unless you speak Spanish. It's best to go in and eat there or order food to go and wait.
