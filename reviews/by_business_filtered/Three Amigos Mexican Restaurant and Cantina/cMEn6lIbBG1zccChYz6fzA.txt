I have been eating here since they opened.  I have had some wonderful meals and some barely edible meals.  No consistency at all.  Very high turnover in staff for whatever reason.  You never know what you are going to get.  They have been open long enough to have figured it out.  Enchiladas are normally very good.  Authentic tacos are good and consistent.  Simple is better.   Hard to recommend.  Sam P.
