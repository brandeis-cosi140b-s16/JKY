I came here for dinner with my husband and was surprised at how small the space is! It is super close to the new place we are living so it is really convenient and we had read good reviews. The chips have some spice on them which I wasn't used to seeing at these sorts of mexican places but don't let that bother you, you can hardly taste it. We were really pleased with the salsa, it was pretty standard. The rest of the meal was good, nothing to write home about but exactly what you would expect. We both had the bean burrito with cheese sauce on top and a side of rice. We were happy with what we got and will come here again as it is close to us but I have had other mexican in charlotte that I enjoyed more.
