After reading all the rave reviews of this place, I figured I would give it a try. My overall experience here really was not that bad, but there were two lacking imperatives for Mexican dining that really bothered me: 

1. Chips, they weren't hot and we had to beg for more. 

2. Drink refills, they didn't exist. Mexican food is salty and honestly, I need like three refills to get through a meal...Also, their soft drinks come in cans!!?!?! (refill cop-out). 

Just my opinion..
