There $5 margaritas on Fridays are great. Main reason we go!! There salsa is good but not hot enough for me and if you tell them that they bring you this green salsa that is way too hot. Nothing in between. The food is great. I ordered the authentic tacos which where good. My wife got the pork tacos which she loves!! We will continue to go here for Mexican food.
