Chilaquiles. My favorite mexican breakfast (possibly, favorite dish, period): A pile of tomatillo salsa-soaked fried tortilla chips topped by queso fresco, crema, and two eggs, over easy. Garnished with onion slices, and if you're lucky, epazote. Not the most complicated food.

But somehow it is; its difficult to find a truly awesome take on this classic mexican dish. This plate, served at La Casa, was overfull with crisp, yet saturated chips, the perfect amount of extra salsa verde surrounding two over-easy eggs just crisp at the edges. Delicious. Salty. Pickly. Perfect.

The mole, as has been commented on before, is amazing. The horchata, at $2 for a pint and a half of creamy, spicy goodness, is amazing. The ranchero sauce is spicy, intense with tomato flavor, and delish. 

They do take out, but the portions increase by 25% if you eat in, and you get to nosh on the ice-cold salsa and perfectly fried chips. My order got a little garbled, and they insisted on replacing it, quickly, with that I'd originally ordered (my spanish is muy rusty). 

This is some seriously awesome Mexican. The best in Charlotte, perhaps. Better than the hole-in-the-wall place I used to order from 3 times a week in Spanish Harlem.

Estoy contenta!
