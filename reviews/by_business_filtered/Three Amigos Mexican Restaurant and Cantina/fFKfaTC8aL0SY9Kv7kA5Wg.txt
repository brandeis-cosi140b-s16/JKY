MY GF found this place on Groupon, and we went there before the Asobi Seksu show at the Visulite. I'm a fan of Mexican sandwiches, so I ordered the Torta Cubana (refried beans, lettuce, tomato, carne asada, hot dogs, chorizo, bacon, avocado, sour cream, and eggs). It didn't disappoint. I have a HUGE appetite, but was only able to finish half of it. Although I've long said that La Unacia has the best tortas in town, I think this one is slightly better! My GF ordered the enchiladas rojas with cheese; the actual enchiladas themselves were fine (no better or worse than any other Mexican place), the SAUCE was simply AMAZING! It was so complex, it nearly mimicked the layered spices of Indian cuisine. We will absolutely come back, although the wait time for the food was a bit troubling: 35 minutes seems like a LONG time for a Mexican place!
