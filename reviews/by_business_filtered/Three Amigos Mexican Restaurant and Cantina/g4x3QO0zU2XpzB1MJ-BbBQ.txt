I mean not the best joint, so it's okay... I had the Enchiladas Verde which was decent... maybe I'm not really into the Green sauce... unless it's the Taco Bell Salsa Verde... I know I know... it's Taco Bell, but it's still good.  

When I checked in I got an offer for a free Empanada. I was psyched because my friend ordered one and shared and I was in love. It was perfectly folded and stuffed, cheesy with seasoned chicken. It's funny because my free one looked like they dropped it on the floor and decided to give that one to me since it was free. 

It was a nice lunch spot (not many lunch specials), so  I can say I gave it a try, but I probably won't go back.
