So, I base my mexican food experience on the chips and salsa mainly, and I must say that they have some of the best that I have had in CLT.  The food is standard menu items of enchiladas, burritos, tacos, fajitas kinda thing.  I had the fajitas which were completely overcooked and a bit bland, and my friend had a burrito which got an "ehh" shoulder shrug.  I need to take these chips to go and then get my entree at Azteca.....happiness
