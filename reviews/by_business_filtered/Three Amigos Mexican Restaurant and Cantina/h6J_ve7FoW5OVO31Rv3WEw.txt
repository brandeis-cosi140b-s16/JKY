So, my thought when I pulled up to this place for the first time was "what a funny-looking sign!"  I'd heard it was good, but I've been to a LOT of Mexican places.  I wasn't expecting much, which may be part of the reason this place just blew me away.

This is the BEST Mexican place I've eaten at in Charlotte, and tied with another (now closed) place for the best Mexican ever.  I have to agree with others, the green chile sauce is AMAZING!  They also have giant margaritas with plenty of tequila in them.  YUM!  And if you're looking for dessert, the tres leches cake is OUT OF THIS WORLD, and they also make a great flan.  

My funny story is that the second time I went there, my friend tried to order another margarita for me and the waitress thought she was saying it was my birthday.  They brought me a double shot of tequila and a piece of flan.  We got a good laugh out of telling her it wasn't my birthday, and she informed us that apparently this happened fairly often.  

That being said, the servers don't speak the best English, but they are so friendly and helpful, I certainly can't hold it against them.  I've had great service every time I've been there.  And the cost is very reasonable as well.  I've been once for lunch and twice for dinner.  My lunch was under $7 (cheaper than my high-end giant margarita, but very satisfying).  Both dinners were around $9-10.  I really can't say enough great things about this place.  I'm looking forward to going again when my out-of-town friends come to visit this weekend.
