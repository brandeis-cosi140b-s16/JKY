I'd like to give this place a 3.5, but for my initial review I'm going to have to leave it at 3/5 stars.  The location on Central Ave is pretty convenient, although this is too far east to still be in a nice and urban area like Plaza-Midwood. The shaded and verdant, albeit trash strewn, briar creek greenway is next door if you want to take a walk afterwards.

Some of the other reviewers claimed that the waitstaff hadn't yet mastered the English language, but I was disappointed to find that their English skills are impeccable (I wanted to practice "mi Espanol!").  The service is a little slow, but the servers were nice enough to make me feel relaxed enough to not want to hurry.  

Another Yelper said that you need to ask for the picante salsa if you don't want the mild gringo stuff, but the one they brought me wasn't hot either and didn't taste good at all.  Kind of like taco bell's chipotle sauce but more burnt sandy taste.  The regular salsa was good and the chips were great.  Our neighbor's guacamole looked fantastic.

The tostada was fine, but not too special.  My GF really really liked the fajitas, which I also found tasty, but they were a little lacking in the fajita spice flavor that I was expecting.  She said that she only wants to eat fajitas from now on when she goes to a Mexican restaurant (so it does have the ability to please).  I also had an enchilada that was pretty good with pretty decent sauce too.  The best of all was the chimichanga which had a nice thin tortilla which made it so that it wasn't too oily or rich.  Combined with the meat and beans and queso fresco it was superb.

I could easily give this place more stars, but honestly it wasn't as good as I was hoping.  My collegiate years in San Diego have certainly spoiled me.   It's pretty tasty, reasonably priced, and has good enough service so I recommend checking it out.  But it's not quite as "sabroso" or "rico" as I was hoping.
