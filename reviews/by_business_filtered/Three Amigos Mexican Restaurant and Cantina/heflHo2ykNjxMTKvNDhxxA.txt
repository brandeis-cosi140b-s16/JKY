Now called Three Amigos, with (as Faith just wrote last week) a bar, new carpet, another TV. Couple of tables outside, if that's yer thing. 

Importantly: the awesome chef that's been at La Casa since it opened is still here, and still in control. Flavors haven't budged, but the scope of the menu is larger (platos typicos, fajitas, larger selection of tortas, etc). Prices are the same for brekkie, a little higher on big plates. 

A little paint and a pretty new sign never hurt anybody. Still, by far, my fav Mex in CLT.
