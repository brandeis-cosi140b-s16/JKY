First timer here and I loved the place. The chips and salsa are just the right mix of tomato, onion, cilantro, and heat along with the lightly seasoned chips. The enchiladas verdes were a revelation but the Alambres was more Philly cheesesteak fajitas than anything else. I'm not saying I know truly authentic but I know when I'm getting something Bubba would like. Still loved everything else enough to give it a dos thumbs up :-)
