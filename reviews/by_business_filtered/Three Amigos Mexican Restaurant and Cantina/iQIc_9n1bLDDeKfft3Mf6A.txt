Holy guacamole!  I love this restaurant, I have already written a review and proclaimed my love, but I want to spread the good word on this new name page too.

I went in last night after an afternoon at the Thirsty Beaver, it was better than normal.  I couldn't believe it, sometimes you love restaurants but it looses it's charm after a couple of visits, not this one.

I had never ordered the queso, it had sauteed onions and chorizo. I might have to get that every visit.  It's tiny, the perfect amout for two people.

Then BORING, I ordered what I always order, enchiladas verde.  I can't help myself. If you like hot stuff, call me.  no really, make sure you ask for their hot salsa, it taste like pureed hot peppers and avocado blended. It will light you up, just like the Thirsty Beaver.

Don't forget to order imported Coke with real sugar.
