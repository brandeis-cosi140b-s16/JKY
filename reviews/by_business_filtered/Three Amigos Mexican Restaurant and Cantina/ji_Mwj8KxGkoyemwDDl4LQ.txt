We tried this place a couple weeks ago on the advice of Yelpers and really enjoyed our experience.  Two words, though: neither of us speak the slightest bit of Spanish (eek), and we're both vegetarian.  There was a real language barrier with our sweet server, and although we both received incredibly tasty enchilada dishes stuffed with vegetables, neither of us is really sure which precise menu items we ordered.  (So it might be hard to replicate.)

But what the heck!  The food was delicious; the margaritas were huge and alcoholic; and the the service was excellent.  When our meals arrived, our server explained that they were out of rice, so the cook had substituted fried plantains instead.  AMAZING.  I'll eat their fried plantains any day.

I look forward to hitting up Three Amigos weekly until I can manuever my way around both the language and the menu.  WIN.
