I heard so much about this place before I went that I figured it had to be hyped up a bit, but alas it was not at all!  The decor is whatever, but really that is not what I come here for.  The delicious food at ridiculously low prices is the main draw.  I love the queso with onion and chorizo to start, chips can sometimes be mediocre, but are usually pretty good.  I've tried a few different enchiladas and they were are drool worthy.  Tried the vegetable chimichanga last time and it was excellent.  The rice is always so moist and fresh.  They have drinks specials daily and the basic margs are pretty good.

Overall you walk out of this place feeling fat and happy and the wallet is not much lighter!
