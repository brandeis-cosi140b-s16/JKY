Ok so, I went here on a date.  This review is long overdue as I'm no longer seeing said guy, but whatcha gonna do.  Yes, this is a very unassuming location, but don't let that fool you.  The food is delicious.  I had the enchilada special and the taste was phenomenal.  I tried pork, beef and chorizo and am hard pressed to pick a fav.  The accompanying margarita was also potent and good (though nothing special, but still good).  The chips and salsa were also on point.   The perfect thickness and kick to the salsa. 

Ok for rating this five stars I wish I could write more.  But simply put this is the best Mexican I have had in Charlotte.  Note it isn't approaching best of all time...that goes to La Rancherita in Quad Cities, IL.  That spot is the one thing I miss about the Midwest.
