I burst a four year Yelp bookmark cherry today! Woo hoo!!!

FOOD.
I ordered the carne asada tacos, a small appetizer size of guacamole, and two top shelf Margaritas. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/three-amigos-mexican-restaurant-and-cantina-charlotte?select=gAT4vN6dTKH4eBGFeMjTWw

The carne asada tacos were very good, not the best that I've ever eaten, but really good.

The tortilla chips arrived hot, and the salsa was really delicious. 

The chunky guac WAS, without a doubt, the best that I've ever eaten. It was just fantastic. 

The refried beans, which I usually don't care too much for, were really good and I ate most of them.

The rice was tender, flavorful, and excellent. 

DRINK
The top shelf Margaritas? The first one was delicious, but it wasn't very strong in alcohol content. Translation? No buzz.

My waitress was the bartender, and since I was nice to her and we got along so well, she "dropped the hammer" on me for the second top shelf Margarita. What does that mean, Sam? I could taste the alcohol from the first sip. Well, by a third of the way down, I was feeling no pain - none whatsoever. This was an excellente Margarita. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/three-amigos-mexican-restaurant-and-cantina-charlotte?select=NRxdRkLKuNyw4anLNm2JjA

ATMOSPHERE
I love the atmosphere and the vibe of this place. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/three-amigos-mexican-restaurant-and-cantina-charlotte?select=pxNdlMTAnn1EKcJNuTcIgg THE MUSIC was AH-mazing!!! I was swaying back and forth the whole meal to the beat of the Latin beat. After my second Margarita, I probably would have danced with my waitress without much urging. LOL.

CLEANLINESS
I went to the men's restroom and it was spotlessly clean. It even smelled great! 

The sanitation rating is currently: 95.5%. It seems to stay around 95.0%, which is not too bad. https://public.cdpehs.com/NCENVPBL/INSPECTION/ShowESTABLISHMENTPage.aspx?ESTABLISHMENT=128877&esttst_cty=60

Wow, I can see why this restaurant spawned other locations. 

My visit today was a total blast! I need to come back on Fridays for the $5.00 Margaritas.
