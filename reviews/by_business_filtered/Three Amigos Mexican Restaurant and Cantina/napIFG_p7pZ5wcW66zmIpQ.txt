All I can say is this place deserves all of it's rave reviews.  I got a little taste awhile back at a Yelp event but I had yet to stop in for myself and experience what this place really has to offer.  

The menu is extensive and has all your traditional Mexican favorites like tacos and burritos.  DO NOT  leave this place without trying the enchiladas.  I decided on the Enchiladas Rojas I think I made an excellent decision.  Most Mexican joints I've tried in the area if I order enchiladas I get a big plate of greasy cheesy goodness with some unmemorable sauce.  Not at Three Amigos the waitress asked if I wanted my red sauce spicy (she must know me)  this was the most delicious enchilada sauce I've ever had it had a really nice kick to it.  $8.99 three huge enchiladas and after all my chips I took two enchiladas home and had dreams about them all night.  They were just as good the next day.

As you can see I highly recommend Three Amigos.
