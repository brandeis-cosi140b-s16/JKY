We were craving Mexican food and we saw the good reviews on Yelp! so we tried it. We went on a Saturday evening.  It is a tiny little shop, but that is ok with me! The staff was friendly. Food was so very good! The prices were reasonable. We really had more food than we needed! I recently started eating Gaucamole-so I am very picky and I absolutley loved it! We will be going back!
