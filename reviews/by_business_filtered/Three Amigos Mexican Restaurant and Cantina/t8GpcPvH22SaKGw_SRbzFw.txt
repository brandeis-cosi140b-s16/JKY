Got here on a Monday...it was packed for a rainy night with sleet & snow falling...I have been wanting to come here since living in Charlotte.... So glad I come today because I'm moving out of state this week...Well the staff very friendly ...my waitress was HOT! ok let me talk about the food I got a free Epanada for checking in on yelp..I order the highly reviewed Carne Asada  ....and my waitress suggested it over the Enchilada order I was thinking about ordering.. I'm so glad she did.. the steak was cooked and seasoned to perfection..... I am glad I had the opportunity to try this place out before I moved away from Charlotte
