I love this place. It is authentic as you'll get in Charlotte. I judge that mostly by the way the tacos are served in traditional Mexican style(cilantro, onions, meat, limes).

Also, they have craft beers and drink specials all night. 

Note...This is Plaza Midwood, not Myers Park, so more divey than richy...

Highly recommended!
