I figure after more than ten visits, I should probably do an update.  As much as I hate to do it, I feel like it's no longer worthy of five stars.  I still like this place, but here's why:

1. They have a lot of "off" food nights.  I can think of at least twice I came here, and my food was not very good.  The chips did not taste fresh, the salsa was bland, the meat tasted a little burned, and some of the food was WAY more spicy than usual.

2. The space is really cramped.  I am so glad it is busy there, but the space is so small in there.  The tables are very close together, and it's pretty loud all the time. 

Despite these minor issues, I still enjoy this place.  They definitely still have some superbly tasty and strong margaritas, which I really enjoy.  And you can still get a tasty entree here for $8-12.  I have a feeling some of the issue is how much busier they've gotten in recent times.  I'd still give them a solid 3.5 stars.
