I LOVE MEXICAN FOOD! The food here isn't like most of the Mexican that I have eat before but it is still really good. I am a very picky eater and still enjoyed it, but it wasn't what I was expecting. Be sure to "check in" with yelp and get your free empanada! Also worth noting is under "Dominican Favorites" is the entree called yaroa. Yum! Our waitress was absolutely wonderful!
