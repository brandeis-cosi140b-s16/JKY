Eating at Three Amigos has the feeling of going over to your uncle's place for dinner...you know, if your uncle happens to be a fabulous Mexican cook.

I came in and was greeted by a supremely huggable woman who gave me a basket of freshly made chips and salsa that smacked of cilantro. When I said I didn't want a drink, she asked again, this time in spanish.

I decided on the Enchiladas Poblanas. They came with a rich mole that hinted strongly but did not scream of chocolate, and were topped with just the right amount of sour cream and cheese. The shredded chicken inside was super flavorful and not at all overcooked. The rice was mild but not dry and the beans were tasty. The waitress came back to check if I really didn't want water twice during the meal.

The food itself was amazing but it was made all the better by the laughing, dancing and general warm atmosphere that accompanied them. The whole shebang came to about $10 with tip.

Oh and next time I go back, I need to try one of those substantial margaritas made from the assorted bottles of liquor stashed on the random piece of furniture behind the counter. I mean, it IS within walking distance of my house.
