Love this neighborhood joint.  They recently revised their menu. Although I miss some of the old menu, their current selections are quite tasty.  I really love their bacon wrapped dates and Tempranillo wine. Their sliders and stuffed piquillo peppers are worth a try! This is a nice, causal, laid back restaurant. For an added bonus, they have lots of TVs. I will definitely be back for football season.
