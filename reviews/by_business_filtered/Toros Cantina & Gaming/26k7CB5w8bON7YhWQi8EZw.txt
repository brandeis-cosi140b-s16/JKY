Took awhile for our server to come take our orders...only ordered a Barcelona sandwich and everyone's order came before mine...even other people who got there after us...my sandwich ended up taking 45 minutes to come out to me...and it didn't have the cheese that the menu said it was supposed to have so I sent it back to get cheese and when it came back out half the bread was missing and replaced with a piece of sandwich bread. Asked to speak to the manager who was not even there so the head chef came out and was telling us how they are usually slow on Sundays and ran out out a lot of stuff, I told him I was not paying for my meal...turns out he comped our whole meal. Never going there again
