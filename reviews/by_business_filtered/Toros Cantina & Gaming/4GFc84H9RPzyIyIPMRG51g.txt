I created a Yelp account specifically to warn people of this place - that's how bad it was. Of the thousands of restaurants I've been to I have never felt the need to write a review so this is a first. First of all, the food was terrible. Just on that fact alone I would never go back. In my entire life I have never sent my food back, but after my first bite of the Chicken and Chorizo Paella I looked down at this huge plate of food and had to send it back. It had a really strange after taste that I can't accurately describe, but I knew I didn't want another bite. At least they did take it off our bill, but a manager never came over. On our way out I think the guy holding the door was the manager; he asked how it was and I was honest. He just mentioned that he would speak to the chef - didn't offer a gift card or anything at all. The service was pretty bad also. One guest didn't like their drink after the first sip and nothing was offered other than to curb it by adding Sprite. Bottled beer is $5.50, drinks are about $10, tapas are roughly $6-12 and the Paella is about $35. They only have 1 draft beer. One positive is that they have a few large TVs that were easy to see, but instead of playing sound from the football game they had slow depressing music. The restaurant isn't very big either. If you were to compare this place to Firefly, it's no contest, Firefly is considerably better - I'll gladly take my chances with Salmonella. Thank god I had left over pizza to come home to from earlier in the day. Even though I live right next to it, this will definitely be my one and only experience with Toros Spanish Kitchen and Tapas.
