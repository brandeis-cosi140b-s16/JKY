1.5 stars: but let's be honest, those stars are all for the food.  The food here is delicious, well prepared, and would make for a great and affordable lunch, dinner, or HH.  Whether it's the taco plate or the chicken enchiladas (go with the red chili sauce; the green couldn't be more mild), you'll be in good shape eating here.

That being said, the service was absolutely horrible.  It's a Sunday afternoon, and there are four parties outside and about four inside.  Two servers, one bartender, one busser.  Still took ten minutes after seating for the server to come to take a drink order.  We then ordered drinks and a side of a guacamole to have in advance, which came out right away... But no chips.  We ask the busser for chips and she says she'll be right back.  10 minutes go by.  Ask the other server: she says she has to get our server to help us out.  8 more minutes.  Finally one of us just go back to the server and ask for chips to eat the guacamole with.

What was really obvious and kind of pathetic in the above scenario is that the servers and bussers aren't working together; they seem to be competing.  And when that competition ruins a good meal, it encourages me to advise others not to waste their time there.
