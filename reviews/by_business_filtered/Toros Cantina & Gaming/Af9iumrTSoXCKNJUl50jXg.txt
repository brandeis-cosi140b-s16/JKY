We came for a late dinner tonight. I wasn't expecting much service-wise from prior reviews, but we had a great waiter and our food came out lightening-fast. 

The roasted peppers were delicious, as were the crab stuffed padron peppers. My husband thought the authentic Spanish sausage was unique. I ended the meal with the rice pudding - delicious! Overall, we liked the food, albeit slightly overpriced (but not necessarily for the neighborhood), and the service was fantastic. Even the manager (owner?) came over to see how things went.

I also had the $6 glass white sangria. It was yummy and did not seem overpriced. 

We will be back and are happy to welcome Toros to the neighborhood.
