This is absolutely the WORST Tapas-turned-Mexican rest in the Valley. Luckily we had a groupon... We ordered the Guacamole (which we were told isn't made until it's ordered) which was a lie because it was freezing cold and had a brownish tinge to it. It was also covered in Cotija cheese, so the flavor was that of cheese. My husband ordered fish tacos, but was served shrimp tacos. Sent those back and received the fish tacos (which state on the menu that it's fresh tilapia. Tasted anything EXCEPT fresh, and there was a 2 inch piece of fish covered in cabbage and lettuce. Absolutely the worst taste ever. Tasted like it was thawed from the freezer. We tried this place once when they served Tapas and it was less than mediocre. Found out it was owned by John Cutter (next door).. Food quality is very poor. Don't waste your money, even if it's a groupon.
