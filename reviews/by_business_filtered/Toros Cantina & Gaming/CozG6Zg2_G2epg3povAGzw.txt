I live around the corner from this place and was disappointed. More on the expensive side for what it actually is. Came at 11 when it was supposed to open and had to wait awhile before they actually did.  When the server finally came out she made eye contact but said nothing.  It has so much potential but with the service and price it's just a disappointment.  Just about anything else could be better and it's too bad anything else isn't in this shopping center.  I swear  Toros and john cutters only stay in business due to the prime location.
