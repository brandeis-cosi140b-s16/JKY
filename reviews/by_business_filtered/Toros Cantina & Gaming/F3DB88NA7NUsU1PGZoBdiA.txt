A rating of 2.5 would be appropriate.

Since we were there to watch a basketball game, I asked the bartender to change the channel on one of the overhead screens and advised our waiter to be prepared for a leisurely dinner. 

We started off with a glass of pinot noir and a Fat Tire at happy hour prices plus orders of grilled eggplant (2 slices of grilled eggplant topped with goat cheese and tomatoes) (2.5 out of a possible Forks), bacon wrapped dates (2 Forks) and pil pil Shrimp (21-25 ct shrimp in a garlic, paprika, white wine and parsley sauce. (3 Forks).  The latter was served on a hot plate and proved to be the best of the tapas though the shrimp were slightly overcooked. 

On the second round we ordered seared salmon over spinach topped with bechamel sauce (2.5 Forks), ham croquettes (2.5 Forks) and piquillo peppers stuffed with goat cheese and crab with tomato sauce (2.5 Forks).  We thought portion sizes were very small given the price and very average quality. 

Fortunately, I had a Groupon.
