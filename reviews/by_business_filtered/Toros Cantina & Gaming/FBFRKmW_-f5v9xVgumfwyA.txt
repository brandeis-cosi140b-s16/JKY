I had a Groupon for $40 bucks to spend here so that was a plus. The atmosphere was great nice layout very inviting large big screens showing the games the bartender and waitress super friendly and nice. the food hoever not so nice. We had the garlic shrimp swimming in butter but no flavor, the brava potatoes were decent, the carne asada street tacos were the best part of the meal but the rice and beans were dry with no flavor. We also had the wings and they were eh just tasted  like they were rolled in hot sauce and covered in cheese. I won't be back.
