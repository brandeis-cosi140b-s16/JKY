I have no idea how this place is ranked so high. Everything that we ordered before the main course was bland;salad, "saffron" chicken, bacon wrapped dates, calamari. All had no taste. The chicken tasted like chicken soup base with boiled chicken. The worst offender was our main course, the seafood paella. 

For a $36 shared entree you would expect something tasty that you can't wait to go back again for, but it was awful. the paella was. It honestly tasted like rancid vegetable oil with boiled vegetables and mushy rice. I couldn't find any chorizo or chicken which would have added flavor. The seafood was there, but guess what? Totally lacking in any kind of seasoning. The clams were also full of sand and it was very unpleasant having spit out grains of and with each bite. I actually am getting pissed off thinking about this because our check was pretty damn high. We actually left a little hungry because we didn't want to finish the main course.
