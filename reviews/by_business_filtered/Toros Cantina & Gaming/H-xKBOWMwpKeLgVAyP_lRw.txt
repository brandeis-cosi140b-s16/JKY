Poor service from the moment we walked in the door. No hostess available, so we stood there waiting. I noticed the hostess cleaning a table in the corner of the restaurant. She looked up saw us standing there and went back to cleaning the table. (there were quite a few clean empty tables already, so i don't think continuing to clean that table was imperative. Were finally shown to a table by a server and given menus. Waited at least 10 minutes, then busboy asked for drink order, then brought us our water. a different waiter showed up, no intro, and just said "what can I get you". we ordered and he zipped away. Food was not very good at all, except for Calamari. Plate presentations were terrible. Sauces slopped in the serving dishes, no garnishes, smudge marks just thrown together.  They overcharged us $1 dollar for the sauteed mushrooms, and when I brought it to the attention of the waiter, he was like "aahhh, ookaay, I'll tell the manager". As if my issue was petty and undeserving. Brought us the check and still hadn't corrected the price overage, stating that he did tell the manager. I can only assume the manager didn't think the change was a big deal either. I have to guess, because I never saw a manager. Too bad, i wanted this to be a good place to go since we live right up the street, but I guess we will need to continue to patronize Firefly for our Spanish tapas fix.
