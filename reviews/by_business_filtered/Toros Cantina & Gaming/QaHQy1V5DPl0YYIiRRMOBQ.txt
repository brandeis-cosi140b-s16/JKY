Used to come here it was excellent  not true anymore. The shrimp fajitas for $19 had 6 shrimp you needed glasses to see. They forgot our quesadilla and then brought it out wrong. I got up to ask for my own chips and then they charged 2.50 for Pico DE Gallo. Prices are too high for bad food and service to bad the old chef left. We won't be back
