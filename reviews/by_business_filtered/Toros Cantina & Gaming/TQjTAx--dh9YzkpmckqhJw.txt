I purchased a Groupon for this restaurant specifically because it advertised as serving Spanish cuisine.  The marquee outside still stated it was a Spanish kitchen.  After viewing the menu and talking with the waitress, she stated that the Spanish menu is gone and that they only serve mexican food.   The service from the waitress was good.  The food was just okay.  We were very disappointed with the erroneous advertisement and lack of Spanish food we were expecting.
