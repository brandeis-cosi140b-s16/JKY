My hubby and I go out for Happy Hour once a month on Fridays. I get off work early and we head to a new place by 4:30 or so. Having read a few positive reviews and since this place is pretty close to our home, we thought why not.  The weather was in the high 70's today and nothing is as good as a cool crisp sangria on a warm spring day.  Of course the sangria has to have some flavor, which this one did not 

Our server was good and very attentive.  The place was pretty empty but it was 4:30 so it was to be expected. We asked our server for some recommendations and ordered the bacon wrapped dates, the scallops, the sliders, some shrimp and the peppers. Everything was just ok. The dates were not as good as Fireflys and we only received 3 of them. The scallops had a sauce made with cinnamon that was a little off putting and the shrimp were way over cooked and had zero flavor. I couldn't talk my husband into eating the last slider either. 

Our bill was $60 which is pretty expensive considering how small all the portions were, it was also supposed to be happy hour but they only discount their Tapas 20% off the regular price. 

All in all not a place we'd return to again Next time I'm in the mood for sangria I'm heading back to Firefly.
