Bring Back The Tapas
Why give up a concept that you executed well to embrace one that you don't. Service is great and drinks good, so if that is all you want this is a nice neighborhood place. Don't go for the food...chips are too thick, the 2 kinds of salsas are tasty, tried 4 kinds of tacos - none were good. Black beans were the best dish we had!!
