I sat on the patio for 10 minutes, at one of the tables clearly belonging to Toros, without being served.  A server walked right by me twice while waiting on the only other occupied table.  This is the second time I've left this restaurant for this reason.  Two tries in a year to eat here.  There won't be a third.
