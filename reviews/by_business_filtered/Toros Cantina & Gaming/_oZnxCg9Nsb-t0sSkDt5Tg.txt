I'm so excited about this place. I live in Henderson but it is worth the drive. I love the environment, kind of rustic meets Spanish. Food is unique, as it is from different regions of Spain (menu even shows origins). I moved here from Idaho where there is a huge Basque population, it is great to bring some of that culture to this city. Also, staff was very friendly and welcoming. I was very impressed that the owner even came to my table to check on our experience. All in all I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great place to have drinks and/or eat.
