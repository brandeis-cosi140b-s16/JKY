We tried Toros for the first time last night.  We are regular at John Cutter's, but wanted to try something new.  We were all pleasantly surprised by both the quality of food and level of service.  We sat outside and Spenser took care of us.  The service was attentive and he made great recommendations.  The food was also very good.  All four of us ordered different items and we all thought they were delicious.  We had to take one star away for the lack of some traditional Mexican favorites (combo platters, cheese enchiladas), but all in all this was a very good dining experience and we will certainly return.
