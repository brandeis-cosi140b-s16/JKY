A dinner for four people cost $200. For a neighborhood spot, we just couldn't imagine eating here regularly. They did a great job with the interior and it seems like a fun spot for after work drinks.

Plus: The sliders and oxtail.
Our server was personable (he ended up in the weeds and we had to get his attention multiple times for dishes and the check)

Cons: The grilled shrimp and salmon had very little flavor
It took 5 minutes to get our first few tapas dishes, leading us to think that they had been sitting under a heat lamp and 45 minutes to get our last two tapas dishes.
