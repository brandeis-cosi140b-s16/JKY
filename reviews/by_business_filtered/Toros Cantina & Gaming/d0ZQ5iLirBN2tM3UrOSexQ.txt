I was hoping this place would be great! Ordered the bacon wrapped dates which I probably wouldn't order again. The chicken chorizo paella was terrible. We took one bite & sent it back. Probably the worst I've ever had. Sent it back & never had a manager come to the table. Our server was nice & it was obvious that she had just come back from a smoke break. I don't have any intentions on going back.
