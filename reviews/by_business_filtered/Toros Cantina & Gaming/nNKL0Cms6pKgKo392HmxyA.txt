This is a Spanish Tapa's restaurant that we stopped at on a Saturday for lunch, before heading to Red Rock Canyon.   

The decor is quite pleasant, and for a Saturday lunch it was not crowded at all.  The majority of the menu is made of small tapa type dishes.

The food was amazing and wonderful.  We shared 5 different dishes plus a dessert. Every dish we had was full of flavor and just so tasty!  With a rate of 5/5, I would imagine most the dishes on the menu would be quite good.  The service was also attentive.

The only thing that holds me back from giving it a 5/5, is that if I came here when I was super hungry, the bill would be far too expensive.  It is perfect, if you want a "lighter" lunch.

I would most definitely return for brunch or lunch.
