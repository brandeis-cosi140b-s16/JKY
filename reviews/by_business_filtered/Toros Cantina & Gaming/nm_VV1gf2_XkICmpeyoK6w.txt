Don't really recommend the bacon wrapped dates a little too dry and not a lot of flavor.  The garlic shrimp where perfect and the ahi tasted as if it were spam from a can. I was a little disappointed with the Ahi because it's usually my fav were ever we go. We tried the strawberry bajito yum-o. Bartender took along time to make drinks and there was maybe only four of us in the whole restraint.
