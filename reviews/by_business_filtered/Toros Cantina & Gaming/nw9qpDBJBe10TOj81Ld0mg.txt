Service was good, atmosphere was good, food was fantastic.  The chicken tinga taco and the carne asada taco are two of the best tacos I've ever eaten, and they were only 3.50 a piece.  The staff was very welcoming of both me and my dog--the outside patio is a great spot for casual dining.  Not sure why there are 1 and 2-star reviews for this place, I had an entirely positive experience.
