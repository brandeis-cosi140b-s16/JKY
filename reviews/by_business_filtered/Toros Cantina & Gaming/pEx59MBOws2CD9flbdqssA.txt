This is not a good restaurant experience. I think this restaurant is about to close. 

Ambiance: Empty restaurant on a Wednesday at 8:30pm. Hip hop - pop music at Spanish restaurant. Gang members with unconcealed weapons and lit cigarettes in a non smoking restaurant. 

Food: seafood was rotting and had to be returned.  Even the sangria was poorly made, although drinkable.    Rice pudding had decent flavors but was not finished cooking (rice was hard and liquid had not yet been absorbed).  Oxtail was good. Ahi tuna is tasteless. Fried artichokes are sour and runny. 

Service: very nice waiters but have not been trained in proper service steps. All the tapas came out at the same time and couldn't fit on the table. 

Conclusion: it's not good enough for their price. Good news is that the next restaurant in this space might be better!
