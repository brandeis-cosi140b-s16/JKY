Came with a co-worker for lunch...everything was really good!  Carne Asada nachos had a large amount of meat and had a lot of flavor.  Had pork sopes which were even better!  Had good spice lots of meat cooked perfectly!!  I'm saving the best for last...the tacos!!  I had a barbacoa taco my friend had the pork al pastor...the flavor on both was amazing!!  Service by dusty was really good especially since it was just her and a runner.  Next time will be for happy hour!!  Enjoy!!
