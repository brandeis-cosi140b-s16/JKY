The service is good, very attentive employees.. The decor is pretty modern and pleasant.. However, the food is not that good.. I tried the stuffed piquillo peppers, which were pretty decent. The croquetas were pretty soft and not very tasty. The safron chicken was terrible and the bacon wrapped dates were just ok. The best thing we tried was the gazpacho, good portion, good price and there was a lot of meat on it! They also have a happy hour menu, 4-7 and 11-2 am. Drinks and some tapas items have a good price but truly the food is not that tasty that is not even worth it.
