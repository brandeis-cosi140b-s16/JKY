WOW! This was our first time eating here & we loved it. Everything was great from the service to the drinks and the food was.even better. A must have is the bacon wrapped dates & the Paella Valenciana. The shrimp in the Paella was cooked perfectly. Chef Oscar Sanchez even came out to greet the patrons.
