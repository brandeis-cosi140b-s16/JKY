The atmosphere is very nice and quite comfortable. That's the good part of our visit to Toros. I found the food lacking any seasoning or taste. Has the chief heard of salt or pepper. Portions are very small, we ordered the braised rib we got one piece which was about 3 inches by 3 inches over mashed potatoes cost $8. I understand small plates but most tapas restaurants plates are at least large enough for 2 people to share. At best the food is bland  and not worth the prices they charge. I certainly hope they rework the food. I don't mind paying more for really good food, but I do mind being overcharged for poor food. I don't normally compare one restaurant to another since each should be able to stand on their own but honestly FireFly is hands down so much better.
