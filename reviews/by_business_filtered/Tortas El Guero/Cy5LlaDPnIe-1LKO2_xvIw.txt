I ordered a Carnita torta. Simply wonderful... the pork was flavorful and not at all dry. The avacado was amazingly flavorful. And, best of all, the service was fantastic. The proprietor is incredibly sweet and welcoming. In this era of great tacos served up by soup Nazi-esque guys on taco trucks, dining here was refreshing. I am here on business, and there is a 100% chance I will try another offering from this menu before I leave. Do yourself a favor, and make your way to 16th St ASAP.
