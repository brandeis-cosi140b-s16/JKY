Ambience: medium sized restaurant with a new age urban feel. Appears to be a family run restaurant with the Three generations of the family almost always present (grandparents, parents, and little children), which only gives it that much more of an authentic Mexican restaurant 

Food: Tortas here are THE BEST in Phoenix. Fresh bread tops generous portions of fresh well prepared meats and veggies. Not your typical tired fatty/sloppy tortas that you may be used to at other Mexican restaurants.

Service: excellent. You can tell they take pride in their food. You usually will be served by the grandparents or the parents with a genuine smile.

Price: it's a bit pricey for a torta but honestly it's a bargain for the fresh factor.
