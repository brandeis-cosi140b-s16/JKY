Wow! This unassuming place that blends into the neighborhood is very tasty. Here is the run down on the menu;

Build or choose your own meat,

Asada, pastor (killer) pollo, cochinita (killer on a taco) Desebrada (killer on a taco) 

Tortas run $4.99 for a mini, $7.99 for a regular which I had and was over following with meat or $12.99 for a supper size. All come stuffed with mayo, mustard, shredded lettuce, tomato, avocado, cheese, and of course jalape√±o. 

They also serve a burrito $5.95 with your choice of meat and as well as a Quesdillas for $6.99 or some Killer and I must say killer street tacos for $1.75 each that was the perfect 3 bites overflowing with meat chopped onions and cilantro served with some limes. 

They also have 15 varieties of Tortas as well if you don't feel like creating your own. Really very clean on the inside and inviting as well. I will be back to sample the rest from this very nice family run business. They do accept credit cards. Support this local Mom and Pop place ( yes they do work and cook your order behind the counter) when you place your order. Well worth every penny.
