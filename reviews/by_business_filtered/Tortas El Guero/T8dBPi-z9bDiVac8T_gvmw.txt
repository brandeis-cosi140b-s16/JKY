Their tortas are the best I've ever had.  They are made fresh right in front of you and the bread is toasted really well unlike most torta places.  Still, this is the 3rd time I've come to this restaurant to find it closed.  It's like they don't want (or perhaps don't need) any business.  It's Mother's Day so I guess they are spending time with their moms.  They are probably eating at another restaurant, a restaurant with sense enough to accept a lot of business on Mother's Day.   2 stars for the unreasonable business hours which just makes me very frustrated.  I'd give it 4 stars but I just can't take the closing at 4:00 pm on Sundays and 7PM the rest of the week.
