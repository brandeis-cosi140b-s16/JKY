While sitting in my office around lunch time, not sure what I was in the mood for, I opened up my handy Yelp app on my iPhone to see what restaurants were in the area.  Tortas El Guero came up and had an overall 4 star rating.  Figured I'd give it a try, been a while since I had a torta.

Drove over, ordered the Carne Asada torta, paid the $7.09 charge, waited less than five minutes and it was ready in the to go bag.  At first it appeared very small in the bag, but upon opening I discovered it was of normal torta size.  

Got back to the office, drizzled the hot sauce they included in my bag on it, and inhaled the thing in about three minutes.  It was pretty good.  Not the best though.  The best torta I've had would have to be from Los Reyes De La Torta.  I don't know what that means in English, but that place sure is the king of the torta!
