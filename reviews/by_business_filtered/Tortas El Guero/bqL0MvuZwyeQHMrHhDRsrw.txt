Just went for the first time and was so impressed. Went half-and-half with a buddy on tortas and both were delicious--couldn't decide which I liked better. I'm a sucker for salsa bars, and this one was first rate--"only" 8 choices, but all of them were quite good. Add on exceptionally friendly service and great value (good-sized sandwich with fries for $8), and I will be back here. Often. Replacing Los Reyes as my valley torta of choice.
