I'll be honest, at first try I thought "meh".  Second try "mmm".  Third try" YES"!  Every visit we have been greeted with a smile and asked how our day is going.  Top that off with speedy service and quality ingredients and you have a winner.  
I recommend the milanesa de res and add an egg.  I have yet to try the tacos but Guero's is a tortas shop after all.
