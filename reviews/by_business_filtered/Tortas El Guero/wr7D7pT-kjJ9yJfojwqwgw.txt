I must have a hard time reviewing places that are less than five-stars, so here is another hidden gem of the valley!  
This place is another hole-in-the-wall establishment brought my way via Yelp.
The torta el pastor was phonomenal! They have a huge salsa bar with this green concoxion that looks like it would be avacado something, but it's totally spicy as wasabi.  I dream of stuff this spicy: I completely drowned my torta in this.  My friend and I were the only people here minus a younger couple behind the counter, and an elderly couple who made the food.  My friend who came with and was as blown away as I was.  Such a great little establishment in close proximity to downtown; I'll be back.
