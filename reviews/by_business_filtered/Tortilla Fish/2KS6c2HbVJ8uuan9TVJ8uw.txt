My personal experience would be a 2 star but I have eating habits that don't mix with their menu. I'm giving one extra star because often own personal eating habits are unique. 

First - I hate onions and don't like deep fried food, especially fish. They have literally nothing that's served without onions unless you get it deep fried. They have shrimp and other not fried fish but it's in a funky looking congealed mix that included onions. 

Honestly, if I wasn't really hungry and in a hurry I would've left. Instead I ordered a quesadilla with fried shrimp. Not the healthy meal I was hoping for but...it is what it is. It was okay. Nothing rave worthy. 

The girl taking orders was sick and cranky. Rather wish they had sent her home. I don't like sick people so close to my food. There was a younger guy that was refilling the salsa bar. He was very friendly and the other reason for the star uptick. 

I won't be back but others love this place so I'm sure they'll be in business for a long time.
