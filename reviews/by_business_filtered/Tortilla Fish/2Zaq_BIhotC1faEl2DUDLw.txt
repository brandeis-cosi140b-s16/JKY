What a tasty experience!!!  Went on Taco Tuesday and ordered the Full, a Fish and the Mixed tacos.  Got one free!!  It was delicious!!! They serve it to you without toppings but they have a nice toppings bar where you can choose your own.  The fish was lightly battered as was the shrimp (loved the shrimp) I also loved their house made tartar sauce with the pico as did my hubby.  Will definitely be going back soon.  Definitely a must try guys!!!
