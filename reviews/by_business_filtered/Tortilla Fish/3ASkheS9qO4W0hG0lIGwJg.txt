It's been a little bit since Tortilla Fish has opened up in my work area, so I thought it would be a nice break from the normal lunch thing and try something new, so off to Tortilla Fish I went!

The place is very clean and service is great, was greeted when I walked in and when I walked out.  

I ordered 2 full tacos minus the shrimp and man were they huge, if I had known how big they were I would have only gotten one, the taco came with 2 corn tortillas and was loaded with crispy fish, a cheesed filled yellow hot pepper, from the salsa bar I added to it some creamy cilantro sauce and come slaw. Even though the fish is fried, it didn't come off as a "fried" food, the texture was light, and fish was tender, this was a very good taco! 

Glad I stopped by to give them a try and happy to add them to my fast lunch time eats
