REALLY...EAT HERE AND EXPAND YOUR PALATTE. No texmex greasy steak fajitas here. Food inspured by fresh light flavors of Sonora. We were seduced by a flier for $5 off $20 or more purchase. This is highly creative chef owns his own place. We had the fish tacos, shrimp tacos, Fish Machaca, and the Gobernador Quesadillas. PRO TIP: These come as double tortillas loaded with meat only. You pile on your own fixens...and the cole slaw on fried fish tacos is divine! Loaded Fish and shrimp tacos were hand breaded and fried in house...NOT some crummy prebattered stuff. They are fresh and crunchy with deep mahogany batter, not crummy frozen panko. Three bucks a taco for fish, $3.50 for big shrimp. Huge..no way I am eating more than two. Machaca is like small succulent chunks of shrimp meat and veggies that had a unique flavor I could not put down. I ate the meat right out of the tortillia keaving the shell intact. It needed no salsa to fill your boca with sabor. Gobernador quesadillia is slightly sweet and creamy (not gooey) cheese with sweet gulf shrimp. It was my favorite and I put delicate tomatillo on it to enhance the sweet, delicate seafood flavor. We missed the Barbacoa...only so much made for the day...means we have to return tomorrow for lunch. Very yummy flavors. Best of show was roasted Jalepenos brined in soy sauce free on the salsa bar. My spouse ate 11 of them and I agreed that I had never had anything like that taste combination. This chef has a franchise explosion just waiting to make him a millionaire. Someone get this guy some angel investors so I can have his tacos at home in Chicago also! Suggestions? Get a be&sco mini press tortillia maker and make tortillias for us. Mmmm. Carve al pastor off a rotating spit for us. Wow...because you are a showman. Your creativity is infectious and I would love to see you turn the average American view of latino food upside down.
