There aren't many places in the Valley that specialize in fish tacos AND are well reviewed restaurants.  I was excited to try TF per the Yelp reviews and my expectations were surpassed.  

The menu is small (shrimp, fish, chicken and barbacoa) but you are ultimately responsible for how you enhance the flavor of your fresh meal with the unbelievably tasty salsa bar options  That salsa bar is unlike any other offering I've experienced.  The house ranch is an addictive drug that enhances the taste of the already crispy fries.  The salsas, especially the extreme ones, are fantastic.  Add cabbage and chopped onions to finish things off and you'll maybe make it a week before returning for more fish taco heaven.

I'm very happy Tempe has an unrivaled fish taco shop that I can take guests to from out of town.  TF will make a mark in every visitors' taste buds.

*Tip 1*
Tempe residents should check their mail for TF coupons from time to time

**Tip 2**
If you return to TF, check to see if the owner remembers you.  I bet he will!!

***Tip 3***
Half price tacos from 3-6 PM and buy 2 get 1 free on Tuesdays.  Work off the gluttony by playing some video games at Gamestop next door.

****Tip 4****
Try to eat at the restaurant for your first visit.  The salsa bar should be experienced in house!!!!
