Mmmmmm, Did someone say Fish Tacos? I must admit I've been waiting for this place to open ever since I saw the "coming soon" banner. A Fish Taco shop is exactly what this area needed especially since the Baja Fresh down the street closed a couple of months ago.  The Fish Tacos are legit! They freshly fry them up when you order them so they are never cold. They have an extensive salsa/topping bar to make your fantasy fish taco just the way you want it. The place is always clean and the service is friendly. The menu is limited, (which I like) because to me that shows they take pride in they do. I highly recommend the standard Fish Taco for starters and the Full Taco which has  fish, shrimp and a cheese-filled yellow hot pepper  (but beware this one requires a fork once you pile on the toppings!). Enjoy!
