This place is really cute and clean. The menus on the flat screens are nice.  The food was ok. Our fish taco shells fell apart, and our fried fish wasn't that crunchy. The shrimp quesadilla was made with corn tortillas not flour, which is different , but not great. I hope they take these comments and make changes I would love to come back and try them again.
