This place is AWESOME.  Its pretty normal to compare a fish taco shop to places in baja mexico or rocky point, and this place is not as good as those, ITS BETTER!  I go to Rocky point, san felipe, and ensenada a few times per year and Tortilla Fish blows them away.  I tried the fish taco, the shrimp taco and the "full" taco.  They were all amazing and the salsa / fixings bar has everything you want and it tastes great.  Now I just hope they open a location closer to my house or work so I can go there all the time.
