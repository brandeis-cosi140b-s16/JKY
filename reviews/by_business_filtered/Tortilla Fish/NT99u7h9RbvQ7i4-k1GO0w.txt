When in Rome...
So I was thinkin,
I'm in Arizona, why not be Arizonian..?
Arizonite? Or is an Arizonite, one who hates
Arizona?
Anyways... 
I drove 35 on the freeway, right next to a little ol' lady, even waved to her; 
she waved back, I love old people. 
Anyways...
I talked golf. All the sport channels talked golf 80% of the time, so I talked golf. And
I even went to a spring training game.
I couldn't bear up and see the diamondbacks tho...
They just suck.
So I went with the opening of Hohokam park
for the Oakland Athletics. 
They played the gigantes.
You might know them as the world champs.
I wouldn't know, I ain't big on sports.
Anyways...
So, yeah. Out west, fish tacos are supposed to be the deal. The business. The foundation...
It was al ' right.
This fish taco spot.
Alright, but nothing like the people in San Diego 
know about.
Not that I'd know about San Diego, or
people,
I've just heard rumors.
Anyways... I've been here enough that I guess I'm an
Arizonite.
