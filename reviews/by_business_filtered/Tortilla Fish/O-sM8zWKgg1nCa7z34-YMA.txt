I had found fish taco shan gri la! I passed by this place a few times, since moving to a new office, but I'm always skeptical about corporate sounding places trying to look like local food joints. This place wows and is definitely a good local find. I went with the fried fish taco ($2.99), the mixed fish and shrimp taco ($3.50) and a shrimp quesadilla. The fish was SUPER fresh and light. They serve the tacos bare, and have all the fixins you could want to pimp out your taco. They had 4 different salsas ranging from mild to super duper hot, quite a few sauces like chipotle, avocado and cilantro, plus onions, cilantro, lime and just about anything you want. All in al a great meal if you're in the mood for fish and shrimp tacos!
