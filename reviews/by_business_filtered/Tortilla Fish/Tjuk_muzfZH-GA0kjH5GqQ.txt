Fish Machaca, it may sound weird and when they explain it as steamed seasoned fish as the healthy option you may be suspicious.  Don't be it is an amzing flavor and texture filling with in a simple corn tortilla. 

Part of the fun here is the salsa/ slaw bar, Yes slaw 2 types sauces salsa and more to customize your taco as you want it. The sesame chili oil goes best of the fish machaca as anything heavier would mask the savory flavors.  

The fried fish was done well too, not over cooked and crispy.  You are are not in to seafood your only option is a quesadilla, but I think this place may get you in to seafood.

My only grip is the price to amount of food. Tacos are $3 each and 2 of them make a small meal.
