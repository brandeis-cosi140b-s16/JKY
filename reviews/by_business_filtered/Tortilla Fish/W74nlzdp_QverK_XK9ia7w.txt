I'm a little shocked that this place has such good reviews.  Maybe I went on an off day.  Based on the reviews, my sister and I went over for lunch.  I had checked in online to receive a free large drink.  I ordered two tacos and he informed me that it was taco Tuesday so I could either pick a free taco or use my free drink.  I thought it was weird I had to choose between the two.  I ordered a fish taco and the full taco.  I think it lacked flavor and it was soft and mushy, not crispy.  The salsa bar was just ok...lacked a lot of flavor as well.  The tarter sauce was pretty good, but that was all.  Like I said, it might have just been an off day, so I might try again in the future....based on the fact it seems like everyone loves it here.
