I'm not exactly sure when this chain hit the valley, but after eating there I was left wondering where it has been all my life. All their food, from the tortillas to everything on the salsa bar, is freshly made in house every day - and it is excellent. These guys really have perfected everything on their humble menu. The staff is uber friendly, too! Will be going back soon  :)
