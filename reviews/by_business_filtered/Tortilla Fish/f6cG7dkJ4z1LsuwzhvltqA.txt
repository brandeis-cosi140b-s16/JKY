i must tell you, this place HAS to be THE best kept secret in town!  we went in on a Saturday night and immediately greeted with smiles and suggestions.  the menu is simple, the salsa bar is amazing and the tacos were OUT. OF. THIS. WORLD!!!

in the mood for some fish tacos?  look no further.  this is the place to be!
