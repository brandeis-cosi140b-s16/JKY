Wow did this place live up to the Yelp hype! 

If you're a fan of Rubios Fish Tacos ... I'm gonna have to ask you to RUN to Tortilla Fish.

There's a new sheriff in town, and they kick the chains asses with both hands tied behind their back! 

Last week, I had an hour before I had to do my Phoenix-Southern AZ work commute and Dude had a day off work... So we decided it was time to finally try this place.

It wasn't too busy at 11. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by who I assume to be Francisco P. Super clean, even their restrooms.

I ordered the Full and Shrimp Tacos, Dude ordered two Shrimp Tacos. And we also split an order of beer battered fries. The free large drink Yelp check-in offer was a nice bonus!

The toppings and sauce bar was phenom. I tried the hot salsa on one, cilantro sauce on another, and added some shredded cabbage. We also got a side of ranch. Glad I stuck to the hot though; unlike other restaurants Tortilla Fish doesn't lie about spice levels. 

Another friendly employee also told us they make all sauces in house daily. So good! Also, they don't cook anything til it's ordered.

I really enjoyed both of my tacos. The corn tortillas were incredibly fresh. 

Yes, they fry the fish here but it was flaky, light and not bogged down with greasiness. The cheesy pepper in the Full Taco was sinfully delicious: Take a bite, and it melts everywhere. 

Also, the ranch complimented the fries perfectly. 

A lot of food for two people; if you drop in by yourself definitely stick to two tacos as the fry portion is huge. 

Overall, great experience, amazing food with a side of stellar customer service. 

We wish they were open later on the weekends. 

Welcome to the neighborhood, Tortilla Fish. I anticipate returning many times and hope y'all stick around for a long time!
