It's noon, so lunch rush... I get it. I ordered "combo 2" (2 tacos, fries and a soft drink). I was quoted 10 min but actual service time was 15 min. If you ask me, that's a bit long for fried fish and shrimp on plain tortillas where you take them to the salad bar and build them yourself. The cilantro mayo is a winner though! Yummm 
It would be handy if the tables were re-positioned, especially during lunch, where a lot of individuals are coming in to order. There was no seating available, so if you are one of the many waiting for your order, you will likely feel yourself in the way and awkwardly looming over the shoulders of those seated and eating. 

The food is tasty, but the flow of things needs a little work. Overall, I would definitely go back. I'd say it is a good value for the price. The creative twist to the sauces, slaw and salsa really make the tacos unique. I would definitely go back again.
