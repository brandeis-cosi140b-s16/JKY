5 stars because of few reasons; tacos were tasty, the salsa bar looked crazy fresh, & I left welcome from the moment I walked in the door! I was greeted as I walked in, they asked if I've been here before (i haven't), gave me recommendations, they also took the time to tell me what everything was on the salsa bar! Great customer service makes for a great experience! Thank you & if I wasn't only visiting AZ I would come here often!
