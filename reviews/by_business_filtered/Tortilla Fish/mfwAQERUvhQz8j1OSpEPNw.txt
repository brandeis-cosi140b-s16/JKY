We really loved this place! Fresh hot fish tacos, excellent beer battered fries, and a wonderful salsa bar with different salsas and cream based sauces like avocado, chipotle, and cilantro. They also make their own ranch for their fries. The one thing I wish they did was offer flour tortillas instead of just corn; start offering the flour tortillas and it'd be a 5 star from me! Other than that this place was fantastic and we'd definitely be back. Also the staff and owner is very friendly!
