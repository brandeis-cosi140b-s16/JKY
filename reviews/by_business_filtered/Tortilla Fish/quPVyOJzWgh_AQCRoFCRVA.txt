Came on Taco Tuesday!  I got two shrimp tacos and fries and opted for a free drink upgrade vs an extra taco.
 The batter on the shrimp was nice and crispy. They have a salad and salsa bar that you can freely top your taco with chipotle sauce and avocado sauce, peppers, and salsa. The fries were also delicious. At first sight the tacos looks small but with the seasoned fries and the extra toppings from the salad bar we left stuffed and happy! If your really felling adventurous try watermelon tea with sprite while your at it my personal fave
