Where to begin?! First let's start by saying I found this spot on Yelp, so I would like to thank Yelp foremost. Without it, I would have never seen this gem of Tempe. Now to the food. Wow, total deliciousness! Tacos are great, complete with a salsa bar and the variety of sauces they offer. The fish they serve isn't heavily battered where you can taste the cod and moistness of the fish-great! Decent price, where they offer all you can eat fish tacos from 3-6 pm each day. Didn't even know until I checked out there website, so that's always a plus. Went here twice, bringing friends along as they agreed with me as this being a great taco shop. Will most definitely come back again. Satisfied yelper!!!!
