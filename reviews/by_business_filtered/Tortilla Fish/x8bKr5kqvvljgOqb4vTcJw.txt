This place is glorious. I've been twice, and thought it was in a weird location but it's so tasty.

I usually go to places like rubios or chipotle, but this is a bit closer to the house (and is overall more authentic). 

I love the fish tacos here, and the crazy assortment of salsas to go with. Will be back!
