Great and fresh tacos. Tried the battered fish, battered shrimp, and fish machaca tacos. Salsa bar has a lot of different choices for taco toppings. Everything was made to order. Batter was light and crisp. Fish was very flaky. Shrimp was firm with great flavor. The machaca was awesome! Wasn't sure I would like it as much as the others but I think it was actually my favorite. The quesadillas sounded great, so maybe I'll try one of those next time. Places was clean and staff was friendly. Def will go back.
