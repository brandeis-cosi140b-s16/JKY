I tried both the shrimp and fish tacos. They were delicious.  Try the chipotle sauce from the salsa bar. It's got a kick to it. I loved the avocado sauce with the shrimp. The only downside is the price. The tacos are about $2.50 each, so if you're a big eater, you might need to bring some extra cash.
