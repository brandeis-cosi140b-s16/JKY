Sadly, it's time to update my review...downwards.  

Got lunch here today and ordered the combo #2, which consisted of a small drink, one fish taco and shrimp salad that was a lot bigger than what I was expecting.  I was thinking it was side salad sized, not entr√©e sized.  (I also thought all of the lunch combos came with 2 tacos, not just one.  *sigh*)

As far as the food goes, the fish taco was great, but the shrimp on the salad tasted *suspicious* so I tossed the whole salad out after a couple of bites rather than risk it.  I may still regret those bites that I took.  That remains to be seen...

The whole meal set me back over $9 and really all I got to eat was one fish taco and small lemonade.  Not so much with the value, eh?
