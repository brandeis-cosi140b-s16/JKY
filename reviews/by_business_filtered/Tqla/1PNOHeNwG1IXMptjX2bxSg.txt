Manager on duty was around but never visited a table when times are slow great time to interact wit Customers. Had the Chile lime grilled chicken was good, cucumbers were a little thick cut. Wanted to really give 4 stars, but the bartender/waiter wasn't that attentive left me having to waive him down for refill even though my glass was almost empty. One of my sauces was empty and he never even offered to refresh. Brought the check turned and left before I could say anything. Then the lack of an attentive manager. Would I come back, yes at least to bring the wife. Again give it a try.
Here for second visit, took my experience to another level. Gave the fourth star! Service was great, food was good. It's not a Mexican food - it's Nuevo Mexican w/ California flare. Try it if not taken care of I can only encourage you to ask for the Manager!!!
