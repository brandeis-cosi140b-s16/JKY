Went here for a birthday party.  Server did a good job with a large party.  I ordered the original margarita.  It is served in a smaller glass as others have stated, but it was a good size for me so I didn't mind.  The drink was delicious.  I didn't order food, but from the looks of my friends plates, the portions are very small.  I'll be back for the chilled tequila shots.
