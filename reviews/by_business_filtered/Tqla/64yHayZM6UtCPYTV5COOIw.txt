I'm not sure why this place has received 2 and 3 stars.  Maybe it's a few disgruntled employees that left tqla.  We had one of the best tasting dinners I've experienced thus far here in Arizona.  The tamale was perfect, the salsas were toasty warm and delicious, the drinks were absolutely fantastic.  Fresh, chilled, on-tap tequila?  I never knew.  And, how many places have happy hour 7 days a week?  Looking forward to going back very soon!
