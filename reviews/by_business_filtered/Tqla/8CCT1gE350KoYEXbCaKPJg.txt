My friend introduced me to this place tonight. Holy cow have I been missing out! Had the queso dip which is off the charts amazing, and it was great they have tasty chips and salsa too. For dinner I tried their Grilled Fish tacos. I have had fish tacos all over the US and these were for sure the best fish tacos I've ever had, juicy, fresh and topped with a delicious aioli sauce and pineapple medley of some sort. Our server Maria was super awesome and very pleasant, she suggested the Ultimate marg and it definitely hit the spot, I could tell it was fresh and non of that premade marg mixes. All in all, gotta check this place out if in the area, I know I will again!
