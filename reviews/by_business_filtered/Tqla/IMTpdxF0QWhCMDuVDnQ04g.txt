I finally made it over to TQLA and  I am blown away !  My previous review was about how great my fiance's leftover fajitas were, so it was time for my own fresh meal!
Seriously folks.....get the hell over there....!! NOW!

Their happy hour is sensational....house marg's are pretty smooth and how can you beat 3.00 mexi drafts? My girl had the fajitas and they have super flavor. Not cheap at 18.00 but absolutely incredible flavor. They even have a fajitas for 2 deal on Tuesdays that sounds great..

I ordered the cerviche app and the todo santos nachos. Both were great!
Seriously....i almost had a heart attack when i saw the cerviche.... :)
Great service as well with John taking care of us.
I do believe this is my first 5 star review. 
Why not? Great food, great value & great service.  Just go!

I have also tried their white Queso app and their quesadilla app..... Both very good.
All of their food has great  flavor.
I also gave their crabcakes a whirl......they are not lump crab cakes. They are a shredded consistancy but are tastey and come with some very well developed dipping sauces.
Someone spent some time putting those great flavors together. Kudo's !
Heather took great care of us in the bar area for the last few happy hours and they have live music as well on friday evenings. 
My new go to spot !! 

Previous review:
My fiance brought home the leftovers of TQLA's fajitas for two.
WOW !! What great flavor on the meat, beans ,onions,peppers and rice !
I took the leftovers and added 2 eggs for a great breakfast.
The tortilla chips were good as well...l..nice restaurant style thin chips.

If the leftovers are this good........i'm going !!!!
