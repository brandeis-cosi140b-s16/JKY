My fiance took me to TQLA for dinner the other night. It was good, but in the car ride home I wasn't riffling through my calendar for the next opportunity to return. 

I had a house margarita, rocks/salt, which was sweet and didn't taste handmade. Non-HH for $6.50 or so. I attached a photo of their better-priced HH selections. Fiance stuck w/water, and we shared the Trio appetizer. The mango habanero salsa was unique, sweet at first with a slow and staunch delayed heat. Yummy and unique but not the type of salsa to eat a whole mess of. Guac and queso were good but nothing to write home about.

For our entree, we shared fajitas. Chicken & Steak ($24). The seasonings and trimmings were great, but the steak had an abundance of gristle and made bites complicated and somewhat off-putting. As stated, flavors were nice, and proportions were appropriate. The rice & beans were unique and tasty. A little extra panache provided by corn, peppers and a cream sauce. 

The 3/5 star reasoning; for the money there are a lot of other restaurants I'd rather patronize. Also, for the price, I would have expected a better cut of steak in the fajitas. I know that fajita meat isn't the best of the best, but it needed to be better. 

I'll be back... For Happy Hour
