This place is awesome!! They don't have the biggest menu out there for food, but what we did have tasted great! They have an outstanding happy hour and more tequila than you can shake a stick at. We had their Margaritas and they were awesome! You can even choose to add flavors to their House Margarita that are not your typical flavors. I had Guava and it was very interesting. The staff was very nice and very helpful since we hadn't been there before. The chips and dip are outstanding!! We also had the Queso Blanco as my wife loves the White Queso dips and it is one of the best we have ever had. The chips that come with it are the blue tortilla chips and they taste delicious. We will be back again soon and we highly recommend the place.
