So first off it is extremely noisy so it is probably not the easiest place to have a quiet conversation however the food is really top-notch we had the crab cakes which you've seen in other reviews which is absolutely outstanding and my wife had the fish tacos I have three of them and they actually have a sweet taste I had a special chicken chili relleno which was excellent stuffed with a chicken and with a light fried I'm everything comes with rice and beans obviously extremely popular margaritas and tequila is so except for the fact that the noise level is very high I recommend it
