We were there for a group birthday party . First of the waiter didn't even smile or introduce himself when we sat down ! We had to ask for plates and utensil The drinks were terrible their margarita so light has no taste or alcohol
Whatsoever !
Food wasn't that impressive  . I had chic burrito and it's so dry ! Salsa was so sour 
The whole time the waiter didn't check on us or ask if we need anything else ! M friend didn't have a free dessert for her birthday 
It wasn't a pleasant dinner I would never come back here again !!!
