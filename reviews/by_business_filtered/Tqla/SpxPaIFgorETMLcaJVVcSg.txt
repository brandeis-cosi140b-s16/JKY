Went to TQLA last night and had an incredible experience. We were greeted by the Assistant Managed Brad instantaneously and he offered to bring us our drinks. Very pleasant, upbeat, and personable manager. I had the Blood Orange Margarita and she had the skinny. Both were incredible. I ordered the Baja Ceviche which was one of the best flavored ceviche's I have ever had. The pickle dipped in chile powder was an excellent addition. She ordered the chicken enchiladas which were also top notch. We each tried out the house margarita and they were excellent for being "house" margaritas. Finished out my meal with an ultra El Tesoro Paradiso and as always, it was over the top if you are a tequila fan. TQLA is a wonderful, eclectic atmosphere with an excellent variety of southwestern food to choose from, combo with the great staff, and you have a true winner here. Will recommend to all and be back many times in the future. Thank you Brad for making it such a great first experience for us!
