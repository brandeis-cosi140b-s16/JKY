Just left TQLA. I'm pretty Impressed actually. 

The food was really good! 

I had the carnitas tacos with black beans and rice.- the carnitas meat was absolutely delicious. The rice was perfectly seasoned Mexican rice and the black beans were cooked just rice with small dap of creme fresh and white Mexican cheese. The meal itself was plenty for me. Two tacos with a side of rice and beans. I was defiantly stuffed after. ~ $10.95

A couple other people had the crispy lunch chicken tacos- a little extra something than your normal chicken tacos. Also included rice and beans. ~ $9.95

Another had the chorizo and eggs (Sunday brunch special) I stole a bite and it was fabulous!! Chorizo and cilantro on top of an egg with a side of seasoned breakfast potatoes. I'd defiantly be back just for this! ($8.95)

The cocktails were also great! They have a HUGE selection of tequila and margaritas.... They even have a tequila flight. I had the berry mojito-awesome and not too sweet. The Bellini-super sweet if you're into that be prepared for a brain freeze. The skinny margarita was also so so good! Oh and if your a Bloody Mary lover they have a make your own Bloody Mary bar!! Super awesome! 

Our server Danny was awesome! He was  super friendly and provided awesome service! Keep up the great work Danny!

Ill be back!
