I have been here 30 times if you live in the Val Vista Lakes or Gilbert in general it is a great place to have a drink.  The ambiance is good especially for the gilbert area and the outdoor patio is awsome as long as its not 110.  The food can be a little hit and miss but the fajitas with the Chipotle butter are awsome.  I literally get the steak and shrimp fajitas and a frozen margarita with a grand manier topper almost every time and it is always fantastic.  The chicken enchiladas or beef with the mole is also very good.  If you like bloody mary's they have a bar on sundays with like 30 ingredients and u make your own.
