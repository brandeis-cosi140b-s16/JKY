On one of our afternoons of day drinking, we realized we were probably going to have to call a cab anyway, so why not swing in here for a tequila flight?

We sat at the bar and the bartender greeted us right away and described some of the offerings on the tequila menu.  I had mezcal on the brain because I wanted to investigate it further, so we ordered a flight.  Our server also brought us some chips and salsa and the two salsas were very tasty.  The green one was sweet, smoky, and spicy, and the red one had a nice fire-roasted flavor.

Upon delivery of the flight the bartender explained the 3 different tequilas, and the palate cleansers.  The green one with pineapple juice, jalapenos, cilantro, and something else is outstanding.  I want one of those for breakfast.  

After trying all 3 mezcal tequilas, I still liked it, but that's some powerful stuff and I was pretty sure I could feel some hair starting to sprout on my chest.  Oh baby!  

Overall we weren't big spenders, but we were treated very well and I enjoyed the whole visit.  Their menu has some very interesting items like crawfish & pecan hush puppies and the brunch sounds wonderful.  We'll definitely be back.
