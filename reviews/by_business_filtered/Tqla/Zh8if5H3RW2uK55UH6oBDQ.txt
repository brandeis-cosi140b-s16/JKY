Went there on a Thursday night. Should have been a slow night... And it was but our service REALLY SUCKED!!!! Sara was our server and she had no personality at all. Sara took 30 minutes to get us water and she forgot to put our drink order in. Sad part was she only had two tables. Pathetic!!! Bottom line is if you are in the area I would go to Ra so you're not frustrated! WE WILL NOT BE BACK!!!!!
