My husband and I came here on Monday for happy hour. The place was pretty empty but it was mid day. We had margaritas which were very good! They said they had flavored but I didn't know it would be an extra 1.50 to a tiny bit of flavor to my drink. We ordered tacos and ceviche and the food was very bland and dry. Nothing even remotely good about what we ordered. Everything needed salt and we are anti salt people. We would only return for drinks. Bartender was nice but not too knowledgable every question we asked started with a "uhhhhhmmmmm"
