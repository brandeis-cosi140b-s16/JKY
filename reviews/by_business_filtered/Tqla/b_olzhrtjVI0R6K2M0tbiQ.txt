While in the area I made it a point to stop in for lunch. I'll have to say I really like this place but I had to send my food back after waiting right at 20 mins for it! It wasn't hot and the cheese had just reached its melting point, and served on a cold platter and the food wasn't hot! 
I decided not to eat today! Maybe another day! 
I did share with manager on duty! Again I can only say if there is a problem or concern ask to speak with a manager!!
