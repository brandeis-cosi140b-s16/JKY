My friend and i ordered a bloody mary which was not good. I get these all over and make them at home. Sent it back and they remade and it was still bad. Ordered the fajitas and they were not very good either. We had a party of 5 and nobody was impressed by their meal nor would go back. Nothing tasted authentic. I was disappointed. Waitress was super nice and helpful.
