Loved it! Incredible mix of flavors and definitely a welcome standout from the everyday! We had great service, decor and ambience was modern and warm, and would highly recommend the crawfish and spinach mushroom enchiladas and carnitas tacos. Yumm yum yum. Need I say more?? Also the salsas are fabulous as well. This is a new fave for sure.
