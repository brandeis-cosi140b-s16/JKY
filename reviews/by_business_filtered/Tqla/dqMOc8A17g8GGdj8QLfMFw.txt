LOVE THE HAPPY HOUR.  My friend and I went for happy hour on a Friday night and the place was packed but we still managed to get seats at the bar.  The bartender was friendly and the atmosphere had a very modern vibe.  The ceviche was out of this world and was only $5 !!!!!!! It had big chunks of fish along with scallops and shrimp.  Best ceviche in the valley and it was ridiculously inexpensive.  Our entire bill was 15 and we had 2 margaritas, ceviche and guacamole with chips and salsa. The quacamole was off the charts too.  The margarita was refreshing and delicious as well.  I wished they had one in Ahwatukee.
