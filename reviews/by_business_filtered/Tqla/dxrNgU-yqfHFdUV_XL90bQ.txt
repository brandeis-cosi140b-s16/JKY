I came here with a friend a few weeks ago. I saw pictures of those jumbo margaritas and just haddd to try it out! lol. 

They have a cute little outdoor patio with a fire pit so we sat outside since it was beautiful weather at the time. So we started off with the Guacamole.. I loveeee guacamole so I always have to get it when I hit up a new restaurant. It was ehhh... For the entree we ordered the crispy tacos combo. It comes with rice and beans and we just shared it. I think it was a fairly good amount. I enjoyed it. 


Last but not least, the drinks! Loved the margaritas! You're talking about maybe $10 a glass. I mean that is the usual price, but imagine jumbo ones. loved it! =)

I thought the food was mediocre. Nothing great. However, I'd probably come back to try their happy hour or just to get the jumbo margaritas. lol. =)
