I LOVE this place.  The servers are so friendly and welcoming.  Every time I sit down a big basket of chips and awesome salsas is promptly placed on the table, and refilled if desired.  The food is excellent as well. The TQLA burger is wonderfully composed. The spicy crab cake is inventive and savory. The chicken quesadilla was very well done with very tender chicken and flavorful cheeses.Their house margarita is one of the best in the valley, the fact that it is $4.50 for happy hour every day from 3-7? That is just an awesome bonus. Their super chilled shots and infused tequilas are something to be savored.  I wish they had more seats in the bar area, must have been asked about a dozen times if any seats were open at my table. I also wish the outdoor area wasn't next to a busy street. It is still a fantastic place, and I wont obsess over the little stuff. This is a must try for Gilbert.
