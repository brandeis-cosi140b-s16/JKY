What a fabulous experience!!  Everything. The server, Tony, was so helpful as we tried to select not a huge portion for the two of us. The taco platters come with three tacos!!  The fried fish tacos were the best ever!!  Better than La Bufadora, Mexico and that's saying something. Nice shot of Patron from a TAP like beer. I wish they had these in SF Bay Area. And then the live band has to go and play Billy Joel "You May Be Right...I may be Crazy". So fun
