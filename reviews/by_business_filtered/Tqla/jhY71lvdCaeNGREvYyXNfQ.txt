Living across the street from this restaurant we have been anticipating the opening for quite sometime. I really really wanted to like this place but honestly I probably will never go back at least not for the food. There are 2 choices of salsa neither very flavorful. We ended up having to add a lot of salt to the fire roasted red salsa to get any flavor, the green was just sweet. I order a bloody Mary which was a big mistake, probably the worst I ever had. This place had only been open a week, so I wont criticize the wait staff too much but it was one disaster after another. We order the guacamole for our appetizer but did not receive it  until after our meal. My meal which was the carne asda was decent however, I couldn't eat it because it was cooked medium rare after I requested for it to be medium well. Our waitress consistently reassured us it "was not her fault" and played the blame game on the kitchen which was a little awkward as we were not complaining just wanted our food. The manager came over and we gave him some feedback. He was very pleasant and understanding, he offered to get me something different since the meat was undercooked. I declined and he took the charge off of our bill instead. I think this place has potential, and only being open a week there is a lot of kinks to work out. Unfortunately besides the guacamole I was pretty disappointed in the food.
