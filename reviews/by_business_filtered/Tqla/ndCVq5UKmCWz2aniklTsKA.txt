Great flavors and fab margaritas, finally!

The hunny and I stopped in in a Saturday night around 8:30 pm.  There was plenty of open parking.  Tqla is located one light south of the 60.

The entrance is very nice, facing Val vista with 2 oversize doors.  We sit in a booth, only 1 large group nearing the end of thier meal with 3 small children.  We ask to sit one booth over which they obliged. 

We started with a passion tea for him and a Chambord Rita for me and guacamole.  The Rita was great, swirled Chambord into the frozen house which did have a nice bite.  The guacamole was a large portion but the avocado was not quite ripe.  The house salsas are very good, one yummy Limey green and a hot smoky deep red thin sauce.

For our entrees we got the steak quesadilla and the carnitas tacos.  As for the carnitas, it was tender but most likely slow cooked.  To me it was more of a red chili pork not a true carnitas that's shredded and crisped.  The steak quesadilla was awesome with yummy cheese and all sorts of flavors.  

We were full and did not try dessert. Nice and accommodating service at this New Mexican spot.
