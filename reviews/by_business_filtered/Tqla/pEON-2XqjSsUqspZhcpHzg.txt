This is one of the time I wish you could leave 1/2 stars.   Id give it 3.5 but not quite 4. It wasn't amazing but was slightly above average.  Went here for brunch with some friends and we had a seat at the bar.  The service was great no complaints there.  

The food however was just ok. Not bad not great. I had the steak tacos and I think my overall favorite item was the black beans and the red salsa for the chips.  Is a bit in the pricey side for brunch so I guess I expected more flavor.  

They are a tequila type bar so i have yet to sample their variety so can't really rate them on that.  

We did order some margaritas and again they weren't bad just your typical margarita.   

Overall service was good but experience was just ok.
