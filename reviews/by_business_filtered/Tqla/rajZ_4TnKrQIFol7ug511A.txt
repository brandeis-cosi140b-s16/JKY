I was real happy to see something going into that building and I am so excited it is TQLA.  The place was busy, but we were seated right away.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable.  Come to find out she is studying hospitality management.  They have 2 kinds of salsa to go with the chips.  One tomatillo with pineapple which was too hot for us.  The red roasted one was hot but not too much so.

We had to wait a bit for our appetizer, but no big deal as this was their first Saturday service.  We had the nachos for appetizers.  They are served tostada style and were fresh and flavorful.  For our meal we had steak fajitas for 2.  Good cut of meat and cooked to a medium / medium well.  Served with black beans, pico, guac, queso fresco, lettuce and a corn rice.  We chose the corn tortillas and they had a sweet flavor to them.

Well after all that good food, the waitress came around with dessert suggestions.  We chose the 4 Leche cake with a marshmallow meringue.  OMG!  So decadent.   
We defiantly will be back!
