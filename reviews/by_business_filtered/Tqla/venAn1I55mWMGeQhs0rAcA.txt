Although we were sweaty from our Superstition Mountains hike, we headed to this restaurant (around 11am) for some replenishing food and some tequila type drinks. It's in the name, right?

Sometimes I can be a wimp with some spicy foods but for some reason, I adore spicy drinks. Our waitress, Danielle, recommended the habe침ero blackberry margarita. I enjoyed my first one. It was a blend of spicy, sweet, and salty all in one. However, when asked how it was, I expected it to be a bit spicier. She said that the tequila was haba침ero infused but probably didn't have enough time for the infusion to occur. She was on a mission. She and the bartender concocted a second drink with sliced haba침eros in it. Voil치! The spicy bite I was looking for was a success! I was incredibly grateful for their efforts!

As far as foods go, I ordered the steak fajitas. Really good stuff! However, my awesome spicy margarita way over-shadowed the fajitas and I think that's why I remember that more than the fajitas. The guac-salsa was also very yummy with the chips while waiting for the food to arrive at the table. This review is about a month overdue but I had to write it! We were so very happy with our service here and would love to return again if it wasn't so far from where I live!
