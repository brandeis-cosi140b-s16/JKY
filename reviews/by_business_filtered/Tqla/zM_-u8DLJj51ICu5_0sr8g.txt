It has been a while since we have been here but tonight we were celebrating the awesomeness of my husband! Our waiter Justin ROCKED and we had  the steak Fajitas for 2 again and I think they were even better this time than the last time. I am now forever spoiled for fajitas. the meat was sooooooo tender and flavorful, I could have had just that and been happy. then to our surprise Elsie our waitress from our first visit 3 years ago came over and REMEMBERED US AND WHAT WE ORDERED!!! She is now almost done with hospitality school and LOVES working here!!!  And it shows. She is no longer a waitress and I am not sure of her title, but she ROCKS TOO!  We had an amazing night and we decided we need to come back more often.
