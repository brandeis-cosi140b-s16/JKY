Came here for brunch and it's underwhelming.  I ordered the chorizo and eggs and others at the table ordered the shrimp tacos.  Good chorizo and eggs is just that, chorizo and eggs.  Not tomato, other veg, and bland chorizo.  This dish was marginal.  Just go to the other 1,000 places that serve chorizo.  Overall, everything was bland.  The Bloody Mary bar is a nice idea but also somewhat average as far as the mixers.  Maybe later in the day for dinner or drinks but brunch or lunch, no thanks.  Won't be back.
