If you have a longish lunch hour, go.  I went around 5pm tonight and there was nobody in front of me.  Took me 5 minutes to get my fish burrito (Thanks to Chris T for the recommendation!)
It was HUGE and came with a little cup of two salsas: green and red.  I cut it in half to enjoy the salsas separately.  
Filled to the brim with rice, cheese, beans and the fish and smothered in some sort of sauce, it was delicious!  
Service was super-friendly and everyone had a smile on their face and said "Amy, your fish burrito is ready!"  I mean, the personalized service was great.  Maybe hitting them at a slow hour was what did it.  There is a little retail spot where you can get incense (they're hippies, get it???) and posters on the wall to peruse while waiting.  I took mine home, but the patio is lovely.  There's even a vintage bike parked out front with little baskets filled with potted plants.  How adorable is that????
