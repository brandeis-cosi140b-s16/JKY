This place is amazing!!! I love fish tacos and I try them every chance I get. These grilled fish tacos are the best ever! Grilled perfectly with delicious rice and beans covered in amazing sauce. If you're a fish taco fan you MUST try this place. The customer service you receive is exceptional and the dinning area is perfect. So in closing I give them 5 stars
