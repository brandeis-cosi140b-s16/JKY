I love this place! Came here with my girlfriend a week ago and we've been back three times since then! The fish tacos are bomb, but I've also tried the grilled shrimp and carne asada tacos and all are fantastic. The staff is super friendly- I always go when this one girl is working and she's awesome and accommodating. Love the atmosphere and the ability to enjoy my eats outside. This has become my regular spot for sure! Absolutely recommend
