Store bought cheddar cheese on a fish taco?  What is this?  1990's Des Moine?  We've come too far as a dining public to have to put up with these conveniently concocted impostors.  Also, the "Sonoran dog" was less Sonora and more hippie haberdashery.

Both items, the fish taco and hot dog, were decent.  It was just their bastardization of these two original classics that got to me.  They were so far from the originals that they shouldn't have shared the same name. 

The place is alright, the prices reasonable, and the ambiance relaxed.  A nice place to include in the lunch mix, given you work in the area.
