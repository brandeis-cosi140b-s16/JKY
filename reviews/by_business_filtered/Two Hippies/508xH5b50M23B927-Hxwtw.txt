We took a trip on our lunch hour to grab some grub for work. I had the burrito special "Chicken Piccata". umm as long as I have lived, chicken piccata consists of: chicken breast cutlets, dredged in flour, browned, served with sauce of butter, lemon juice, capers, and stock or wine. Right? This was none of those things.. it was more like a chicken fajita burrito and bland at that. It was decent and hefty but Im sorry Baja Fresh blows this place out of the water.
