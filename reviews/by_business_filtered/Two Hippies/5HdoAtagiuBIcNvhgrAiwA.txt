This place always has such a long line during the lunch rush, I figured that must mean something.

It does. It means it takes a long time for them to take your order.

I don't get what all the long lines are about. I love the decor and the uniqueness of a beach fish taco stand in Phoenix, I really do. Especially since it's walking distance from my apartment.  But one fish and one chicken taco later, I didn't get it. They tasted like tacos I could have made at home with tilapia, store bought cheese, and store bought shredded lettuce and tortillas. I was very disappointed. I haven't been back since. I'd be willing to go back to try one of their fruit smoothies which people do rave about, but not for the food by any means.
