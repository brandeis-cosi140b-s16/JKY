What a nice little treat . We stopped by the "Shack" to give the Hippies a try. 
We instantly enjoyed the decor and feel  of the place. Quaintness abounds, funky posters, kitschy  knick knacks  and  bright colors give it a groovy feel. While not someplace I would bring the whole family this is a good place to stop for a quick bite or a snack.  This is not a sit down eating establishment , you go in place your order ( try the three taco combo)   and then wait outside. There are picnic tables , stools and pub stools around the outside to sit at. It was a clear beautiful day so very nice. 

The hubby and  I   tried  pork, chicken and beef tacos which were all fresh and tasty.Tacos and  burritos were on fresh flour tortillas and had cheese, tomatoes, and lettuce and great spices. My husband also ordered a fish burrito which was ginormous  and he swore it  was over a pound . We also got cans of soda and ate all this for 11.00  not bad. No soda on tap.

I must mention that the owner( ?)  made us feel right at home and was super nice and even funny. His attitude was a big plus and made the eating more enjoyable. It was easy to see he enjoys his work .
