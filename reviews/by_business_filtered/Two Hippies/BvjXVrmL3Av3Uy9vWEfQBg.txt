My primal food instincts failed me today! Or was it their bright, colorful sign that mislead me?!  It said "outrageous" and the joint itself had distinctive designs from the 70s that stood out like a sore thumb in this hoody part of 16th St.  

I usually research a place before trying but this was a random stop by with a risk level of safe.  How could you go wrong with Tacos and Burritos, right? Well, it wasn't all that terrible but at the same time it lacked authenticity by miles. 

The interior decor was exactly what you would expect from a pot smoking hippie with posters of Jimi Hendrix, Rolling Stones, and Bob Marley plastered literally every inch of the neon green interior walls and ceiling.  I very much appreciated all the colorful details that was incorporated to express the character of the establishment.  The design department deserved 5-stars for sure!

Coming here, I was a bit hungry so I opted for their 3-pack tacos. Of the six toppings or so, I went with their Green Beef, Carne Asada, and Fish. The key attribute about their Tacos is their enormous size. As I was picking my order up, I seriously thought I was carrying back THREE burritos! I was overwhelmed with each taco as they were HEAVILY packed with chilled, diced cabbage and tomatoes. It was a one-to-three ratio of meat to vegetables, which explains the size and weight, right? They packed a fork and knife but I ate it true street style via hand. My eating experience was just a complete mess, literally. 

The abnormally massive size could not compensate for the quality. The shredded Green Beef was a little dry with simple Mexican flavors. I was hoping the Carne Asada would save the day, but still fell short. The tortilla was nothing special. It had a generic store taste to it than of an authentic hand made. I cannot review the Fish right now, as I took it back with me on the road. I was too full from the bland, uncreative flavors that one would have expected otherwise.
