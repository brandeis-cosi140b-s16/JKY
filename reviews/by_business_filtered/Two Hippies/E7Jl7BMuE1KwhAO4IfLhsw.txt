My friend always wanted to try this Two Hippies. It was horrible. We did not get what we ordered, not sure what it was but we know what it wasn't. We ordered the special tea and when the guy brought it to us he said " we ran out", it was more expensive that the regular tea and we were not offered any kind of refund. Waste of time and money.
