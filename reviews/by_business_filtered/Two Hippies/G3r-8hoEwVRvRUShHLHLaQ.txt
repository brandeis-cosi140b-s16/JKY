I will keep this one short.

Value: Great. (lots of food for the moo la...wait is that how you spell it?)
Atmosphere: Ummm...interesting place.  But cheaply put together.
Quality: Ho hum. The food was fine...but nothing special.  Very plain.
Service: Well not much in the way of service...order and the window and get out of the way.

Not my favorite but worth the visit.
