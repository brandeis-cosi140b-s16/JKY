Two Hippies makes their own homemade salsa, which is pretty sweet considering how inexpensive their food is. I have ordered the carne asada, the fish, the red chile and the chicken. My favorite is the red chile. (Note: the tacos contain beans so if you don't like whole pinto beans in your taco, definitely ask them to leave it out.) The tacos were wrapped in a light, soft flour tortilla the day I came, and came served with fresh tomatoes, onions and cabbage. They also have a variety of baked goods (cookies and brownies) in the case. If you're not a taco fan, there are also burritos on the menu as well as quesadillas. The owner is great, knows me by name and I've only been there twice.  He also informed me that all of the ingredients are organic. Great place to grab lunch if you're in a hurry. Outside patio seating. The lemonade was ok the day I went, a little watered down (a bit too crystal light for my liking.) Otherwise, great. I mean, I can't eat more than two of their tacos but I recommend ordering a three pack, just to be safe. You'll probably want a snack later in the day and you won't regret having one of those bad boys handy.
