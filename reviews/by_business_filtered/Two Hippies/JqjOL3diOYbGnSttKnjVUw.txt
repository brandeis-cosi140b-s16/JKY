What a wonderful place. I ordered a pork taco, a green beef taco and a fried fish taco. Everything was wonderful. The fish was crispy and tender in the outside, the pool and beef were beautifully seasoned and the volcano salsa was spicy but flavorful. Hands down some of the best tacos I have ever had!
