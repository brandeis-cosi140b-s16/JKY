This place was fairly good, I have eaten there a few times and have learned the pork tacos are the best!!!! I have also had the fish not a big fan, loved the hot sauce was good. While the food is ok, with a great price this is not what I envisions a taco. But the idea of eating organic is great. This is not your regular taco joint.
