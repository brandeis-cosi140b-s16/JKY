I decided to visit this awesome 'beach stand' eatery 2 days ago to taste their food and take more pictures.  I originally visited last fall just to take pictures(!)  I just adored their 1960s-70s decor vibe- I mean, music posters/pin-ups on the ceiling?  LOL.  I just got a kick out of checking every angle of this gem that stood out among reserved architecture/businesses on this stretch of a street.  Anyhoo, I sampled the vegetarian (yay) taco with Sprite (out of a can poured into plastic cup with ice).  $4 for a filling late lunch while continually to savor the remaining remnants that tided over the entire outdoor-only eatery: old license plates, vintage signs, painting of a guitar on a picnic table, 2 Adirondack chairs, numerous desert plants, vintage washer, and a '60s front-half of a van (interior was torn out, of course) that looked in sharp shape.  So enchanting!  There were others taking pictures like I was, and I just had to giggle!  So, food/drink was enjoyable and the place was clean & orderly with an approachable feel like at the beach.
I asked a sweet personable young gal working there whether the owner's from Los Angeles, because this place is also somewhat similar to the legendary Oki Dog hot dog stand of the '70s-'80s that was frequented by punk rockers & their followers (Darby Crash of the Germs, as a start).  And, she said that no, the boss was not from there.  Two Hippies must be an Oki Dog incarnate then.  BTW, the gal even asked me afterwards how my meal was ("yum") and was also happy to take a picture of me at the front with my camera.
Next time I have out-of-town guests, you can bet I will take 'em to Two Hippies.  See you there.  Smiley Face like their signage :)
