stopped by this funky looking place around 6pm on a weeknight and no wait. ive wanted to stop here many times before but have avoided the twistingly long lines i see when i pass this place around lunch time.

the people inside were very friendly and although quite a bit stuffy and small inside, i could dig it. they have a large enough outdoor area with misters and fans and a pick up window to get your food at.

my friend and i each got the 3 tacos and a fruit slushie. i chose pear, and she chose raspberry guava. both were delicious and refreshing. the sign outside said "flavor of the day - strawberry margarita", and i was a little excited that they had margaritas but alas - no liquor license, so no cool, crisp, refreshing corona to wash down my tacos with either.

the tacos are good size each, with plenty of delicious choices of meats/fillers to choose from. we both picked red beef, chicken, bean and cheese, and carne asada. the red beef was my favorite, with the carne asada a close second. skip the chicken, it tasted rather bland. the cabage was delicious and crisp and nice substitute for lettuce. each of our orders came with 3 salsas and 3 limes, absolutely essential for taco eating.

i really enjoy two hippie's burgers and love their tacos. can't wait to go back.
