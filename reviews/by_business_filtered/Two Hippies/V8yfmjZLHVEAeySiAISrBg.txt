I had some time to burn and was getting hungry so I stopped here. Ive heard about this place for a bit but never have given it  a chance.  Between the old vdub out front and the sign for "the best fish tacos in town"  I was in.   And who doesn't love a good fish taco.  

I ordered the one they are supposedly famous for there fried fish taco and a grilled fish taco.  To be honest I wasn't impressed with the fish taco it was good but the grilled shrimp taco was AMAZING 

I would go back there again for the gilled shrimp taco I think they are the best I have had in the Phoenix area.  There prices were reasonable the tacos were about $3 each. And I got there just before the lunch rush at noon.  Service was quick and friendly.   I read somewhere that they had some health code violations and I did notice that the place needed to be cleaned a little more.  But for me good food at a good price with good service is worthy of five stars.
