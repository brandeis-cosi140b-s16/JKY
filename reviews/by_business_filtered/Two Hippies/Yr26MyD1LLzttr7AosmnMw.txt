I live locally, and have driven by this surf shack hundreds of times. I found myself really hungry after work, and, feeling bored of the usual haunts, decided to finally give Two Hippies a try. 

I got a heavy brown paper sack full of bulging fish tacos, and a side of chips and salsa. The fish tacos were juicy and very tasty - solidly good, yet nothing that blasted-me-out-of-the-water good. I think the value is what is most noticeable: $5 gets you three tacos with stuffings of your choice. I was very happy, and think that even Rubio's could go toe-to-toe (I may even prefer Rubio's fish tacos to Two Hippies). 

Check it out, and you'll get a tasty meal for dirt cheap. The success of Two Hippies is evident by their recent boon: I think they're opening two more places (pizza and a breakfast joint), to add to their local empire. I'm interested to check them out, and hope they are as good at the tacos at their surf shack on Camelback.
