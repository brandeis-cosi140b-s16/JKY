I've wanted to try this place for awhile so I was excited to finally have the chance. The building is really cool with a ton to look at - old plates, signs, stickers, etc. There's mostly outdoor seating so this wouldn't be the best place to go to on a really hot or rainy day, but today was perfect for it. The two guys working were really nice and helpful, which is always a plus.
The menu is pretty basic - several types of tacos and burritos but nothing too crazy or complicated. I got the three taco plate - three tacos with cilantro, onion, tomatoes, beans, rice, cheese on a flour tortilla with your choice of meat - for a mere $5. I was expecting them to be small or flimsy at that price but I could only finish two! Well, after my "magic brownie", that is - which was awesome and baked locally. They were LOADED with toppings and meat. The meat was very juicy, the toppings fresh and the tacos come individually wrapped in foil with a slice of lime and a side of a mild salsa. 
Three delicious carne asada tacos, two fish tacos for the mom, a brownie and a bottle of water for less than $15? I will definitely be back!

P.S. Remember, CASH ONLY!
