A cup of Ice for $3! 
Are you Kiddin' me?


Three tacos for $5 is a good deal!
A can of Soda for $1 not a bad deal...
But when you order the lemonade for $3, it's 95% crushed ice & comes with a cute little umbrella in the straw, well this part is a "rip off!"
"Seriously! "

I usually order differnt Tacos & they are good! All the ingredients are fresh...The  fish, carne asada and chicken are my favorites.  
The green and red salsas are tasty. Also freshly made

If I didn't feel so ripped off on the lemonade, & I've made this mistake several times, I would give this place Five Stars!
