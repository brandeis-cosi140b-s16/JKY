Torta is amazing! Quaint location that you'd miss if you weren't looking. I used to drive past it all the time and didn't know it was there until I was looking up places to east on Yelp! Really fresh ingredients! Wish they weren't out of the blood orange lemonade, but the acai lemonade was really good too!
