We stopped in on a Friday night. Ordered 2 chicken tacos and nachos to split. 
The chicken tacos are big and tasty, the only thing is the chicken doesn't seem to be seasoned at all. Plus it was a little dry.
The nachos were pretty good, again the chicken was flavorless and dry but the cheese made up for it, they were yummy.
