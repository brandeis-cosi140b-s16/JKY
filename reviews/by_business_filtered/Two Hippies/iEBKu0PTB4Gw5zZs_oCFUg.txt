I have been passing this place for many years and stopped in today as I was on a taco kick.  I had 3 taco's to go, which were delicious! I loved the choices of filling, and to go packaging.  I will return because of the quality, price and friendliness shown me.  Want to try the buffalo chicken burrito next!
