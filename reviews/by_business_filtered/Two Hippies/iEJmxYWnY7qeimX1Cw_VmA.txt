Well... I'm not sure what happened, or what is outrageous.

Okay, the first time I visited this place... carne asada burrito was pretty tasty. The fish tacos, were... you know, fish tacos. Reasonably priced, reasonably good. Plus good drink. Good enough to make a visit #2, and bring a few people with me. 

HOWEVER, visit #2... I must say, it is not reasonable to have your salivary glands dry up after a bite of fish taco, or chicken taco. 

In sum... some items here are outrageously salted and give you outrageous high blood pressure. 

Oh, I'll give an additional star for the availability of sriracha.
