I am a big fan of their Taco special - 3 for 6 bucks. Initially I was disappointed the first time I came here because they did not have fried tacos. I tried the chicken tacos and they were huge and I got full on one taco. Took two home and fried them in a pan later that night to reheat them. Fresh they are great, fried at home for left overs they ROCK!  Fun decor and a real laid back atmosphere. I am just here for the winter so it was very comfy, in the summer it has to be hell as most their seating is outside. Don't miss this one, you cant cook this cheap! Great eats and very friendly staff.
