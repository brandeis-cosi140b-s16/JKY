I was disappointed in my last visit, I had the 3 tacos ( carne asada and red beef). The carne asada was really bad...tons of fat and grissle, I was only able to take 3 bites and I could not do no more. The red beef had good flavor, the problem was that the meat is cooked in a broth, so when they put it in the taco the whole tortilla was soaked and falling apart..I ended up having to pick at it with a fork.

My husband had a carne asada burrito..again the meat was not good and he did not like the cabbage ..it looked old and tasted old.

The service was solid and there are other things that I like about the place...but they need some quality control..who wants to eat fatty carne asada and soggy tacos??? 

Two hippies if you are out there reading this..please...address some of these issues, I really want to come back.
