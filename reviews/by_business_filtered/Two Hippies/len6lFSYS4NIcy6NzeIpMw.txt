This place never disappoints!
The owners are super chill - Kalen & John, stop by and meet them. I love how friendly they are and they take the time to explain their menu options!
The food is very tasty and freshly made. 
The portions are very hearty...nom nom nom
I recommend trying the daily special since they always knock it out of the ball park!
I love the fact that they might extend their hours and talks about possible Sunday hours are in the air, now I'll enjoy their food more.
Ok enough writing, my tacos await!
Bon App√©tit!
