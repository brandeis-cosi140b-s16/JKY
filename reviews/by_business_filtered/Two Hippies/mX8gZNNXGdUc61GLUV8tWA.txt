Yuck. The chicken in my tacos was dry and tasteless. The lemonade was pricey and tasted like Countrytime powder. The people that were eating here apparently thought they were awesome, and I was not, so they gave me the stinkeye the entire time I was there.

Came here on a friend's suggestion. Was definitely not impressed. Bad food, bad clientele...not coming back ever again.
