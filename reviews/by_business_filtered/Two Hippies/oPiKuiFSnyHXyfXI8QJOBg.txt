Not what you would expect. 
This place does have the best fish tacos in town in addition to many other great Baja inspired dishes. Be careful though... The food here is addicting. 
I'm personally switching the mouth watering fried fish to a healthier grilled option. It's not a disappointment. 
People are very friendly and the place gets a little overwhelmed during lunch and other heavy traffic times. Hard not to be patient around all the hippie decor. 
Surprisingly... Highly recommended!
