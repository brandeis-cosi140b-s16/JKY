Hands down, best fish tacos I have ever had in my life. Was recently in town visiting family, and since  I live in Pittsburgh, I am not used to having GOOD tacos. The pork ones are also amazing, as well as the loaded nachos. The fried fish tacos really took the cake though - the chipotle mayo is out of this world! Next time I'm in Arizona, this will be my first stop!
