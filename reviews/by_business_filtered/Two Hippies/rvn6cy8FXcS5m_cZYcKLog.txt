Jumped out of dead stop traffic on a whim. A lot of thought went into the decor both inside and out. I'm certain it helps for walk in traffic. Nice guy at the counter was friendly and talked up the food in a non-salesman like way. Normally I shy away from Carne Asade unless I know the place, but this cat talked me into it. The green Chile Carne Asade is not to be missed. Obvious marinated in Chile's, not dressed in them after the fact.  Well done I say! Got 3 huge tacos for $5 and 2 waters for a buck a piece. Great deal/ good ambiance/ friendly knowledge staff. If you're in the neighborhood check it out.
