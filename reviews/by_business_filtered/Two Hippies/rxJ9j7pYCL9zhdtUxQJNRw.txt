Stopped by today and got the fish, green chile, and red chile beef tacos. The fish was the best of the three--grilled white fish with a creamy sauce on a flour tortilla with cabbage, tomato cheese, and beans. I prefer grilled to fried fish tacos so this worked for me. 

The green chile and red chile shredded beef tacos were good, but I wanted to taste more of the chile sauces in each. Nice tender beef without the lardy taste that you get at some other Mexican food joints.

The tacos tasted fresh and light, never heavy, and I didn't feel bloated or tired after I ate them like some Mexican food take-outs and restaurants. They were pretty big for $1.50; three filled me up.

They've got 12 different kinds of lemonade, but I didn't order any drinks. I wish I had after I saw someone else's watermelon lemonade. 

I's not Barrio Cafe, but if you're looking for a fresh, light Mexican lunch that is a local alternative to Chipotle, La Salsa, and Baja Fresh, Two Hippies is the place. I'm a fan.
