I have wasted so much time driving past this place! Such a great little place with amazing food.

My girlfriend and I really loaded up:

Together: a order (very good amount) of chips and red salsa and a quesadilla

She: 3 fish tacos with cabbage and sauce and a little pico de gallo with a raspberry lemonade to drink.

Me: a fish taco with the cabbage, sauce and pico and a carne asada burrito with pico, rice and beans with a Mountain Dew.

(All together that food was $25! We were stunned! Such great value.)

When we ordered, my girlfriend was asked if she wanted the fish tacos fried or grilled and she said grilled, but received fried.  She didn't mind in the least and from the first bite she was over the moon with how good the tacos were and I have to agree.  They were so delicious and it seems to be what they are well know for.  The sauce had a little more kick to it than I was expecting.  Not a bad thing, just wasn't expecting that heat.

The burrito was massive. So delicious, the only tiny tiny tiny complaint was that either the beans or pico in the burrito had cilantro and I am not a huge fan of the cilantro.  

Overall it was such a great vibe and delicious food.  Before even getting up from the table we had decided that it was our go to Mexican food place.

My girlfriend even ordered a burrito to go for lunch the next day!

Don't drive past this place one more time, without trying it!
