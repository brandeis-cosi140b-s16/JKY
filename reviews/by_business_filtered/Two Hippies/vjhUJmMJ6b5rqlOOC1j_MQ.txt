I REALLY wanted to like this place.  The cute cashier boy and the fun little stand was a great start; however, the tacos were another story.  I ordered the fish taco and the carna asada taco with green chile.  My tortillas were falling apart from the grease and from the large quantity of the meat, cheese, and cabbage.  That was not too bad but the flavor or the tacos were just plain salty.  So salty that I really couldn't enjoy the beef in my taco.  I tried the fish taco and the fish was "sick" as in not well, and ill.  That's what I call fish when they have this fishy smell that's beyond the normal fish smell.  I know my fish, trust me (I'm Asian okay) and the fish in my taco was just not right.  

Granted the tacos were cheap and the quantity was large; however,  I rather pay more and eat a fish taco that is "not sick."
