$1.50 TACOS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yum!
This place was recommended to us by a local. We asked where to get a good cheap taco and this place hit the nail on the head. 

Two hippies are on the right track with this place. It's a bit small and it took about 20 min to get my food (they were really busy) but it was worth it. If I lived in Phoenix I would come here daily. 

A word about the fish tacos...they are good but seem as though they might use canned fish instead of fresh grilled chunks like most places. Considering the price this is acceptable!

The drinks and baked goods looked great though I haven't yet tried any. I'll save those for next time I'm in town.
