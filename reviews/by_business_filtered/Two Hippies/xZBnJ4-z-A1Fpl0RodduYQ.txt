As a taco lover, I will try any taco place once. Unfortunately that's going to be my only visit here. The atmosphere is decent. It's all outdoor picnic table seating, which I don't mind unless it's crazy hot out. The cashier was less than helpful. We asked what the best tacos on the menu were, only to be told that  she didn't know it all tastes the same to her. Well, she was right. The Carne asada was dry and lacked any significant flavor. The green Chile was also lacking in the flavor department. My lady had a fish taco which she said was good. But the tacos had too little meat and too much lettuce. Overall, the place is neat, but the food needs an overhaul. I'll be skipping this place on my Taco Tuesday ventures.
