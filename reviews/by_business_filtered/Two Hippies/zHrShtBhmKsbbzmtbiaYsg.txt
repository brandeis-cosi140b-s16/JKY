I couldn't have been more disappointed with my first venture into a Two Hippies.  My husband and I rushed home to see who could hammer this place on Yelp first (he beat me).  I ordered a hot dog because I love hotdogs.  This one was large and cheap, but the flavor was mostly salt, and it looks boiled, which did nothing to improve it.  The bun was excruciatingly hot, and as soon as it cooled enough to eat, was excruciatingly tough and chewy (either overly steamed or overly microwaved).  Hot dog alone would have earned 2 stars, but unfortunately I tried to share the hubby's tacos...  eeeewww, the fish mush tacos were downright nasty.  Seriously, they were not just lacking good qualities, they had a mushy texture and bad taste.  The pork in the pork tacos was fatty, chewy, and overly marinated.  The green beef was tolerable, but nowhere near pleasant.  Overall a bad food experience and I came home hungry enough to pig out on Christmas cookies.  Atmosphere is fine, place is clean, service quick and pleasant - but that does not make up for the food.
