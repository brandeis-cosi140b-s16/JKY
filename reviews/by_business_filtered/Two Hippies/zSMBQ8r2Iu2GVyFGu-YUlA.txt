Well, when your expectations are about as low as they can be, it's easy to be pleasantly surprised. The other Two Hippies on 7th Ave in Melrose Plaza left such a bad taste that I couldn't bring myself to try this one. But eventually my longing to be on a beach in Mexico tempered with a bad economy drove me to try. It was good. Quite fun ambiance. I was glad I didn't go during a peak time because where you order is claustrophobic. But 3 tacos for $5 filled to the brim AND vegetarian options made it worth it. The biggest surprise was the free refill on the yummy fruit lemonades. $16 for 6 tacos, two lemonades (and refill), chips and salsa was a scream. As hungry as I was I couldn't finish all 3 tacos. Good stuff. The boys working were delightful!
