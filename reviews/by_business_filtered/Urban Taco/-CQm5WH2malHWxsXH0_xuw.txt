I came in while I had time to spare in between dental appointments. (Shoutout to Dr Serrano and Dr Day) I was hungry and finally had a chance to sneak in some me time so I decided to take myself to lunch. There's a ton of local eateries in this biltmore-ish area so I was determined to check something off my Yelp! Bookmark list. Urban tacos it is! In a seemingly boring strip mall but beautifully designed inside. The door was open and letting in the cool breeze of the day. I was short on time and didn't want to overindulge so I stuck to my budget and schedule and ordered a Corona 2 street tacos and a half order of chips and guacamole. The service was good. She recommended the green chile cilantro salsa which was excellent and the short rib taco, equally as good. 

I love this place and hope I can return soon with the beau.
