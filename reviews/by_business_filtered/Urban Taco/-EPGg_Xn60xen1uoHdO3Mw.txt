Best Short Rib Taco I have ever had. Urban Taco is a small business that packs in big flavor. The salsa variety was a fun experiment to try them all. We were with a large group so it was a bit harder to figure out what was what but with a table for 2 or 4, it would be nice. 

This place isn't a quick turn over restaurant. So settle in, enjoy the company and your salsas and you'll be fine. 

Beer, Wine and Tequila. Pretty basic here and done well.
