Atmosphere and decor are welcoming and unique.Tacos were super greasy, the bottom of my plate had a quarter inch layer of grease when I finished. All I could taste was the grease when I was done. I dont know why I kept eating they weren't even that good. I read the other reviews and was excited to try the tacos. I tried the octopus and didnt finish that one, it was very rubbery and chewy. We had 3 salsa's and chips which we liked or I would have given less stars. Service was OK, not real friendly, or speedy. good thing it was happy hour and it was priced well.
