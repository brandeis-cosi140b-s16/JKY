Hmm, as a server/ manager/ been a bartender before. This place is very unfriendly.   The food is alright.  #I should have gone to Sprouts. I was going to make my own dinner, but This place caught my eye.  First and last time.  Sorry, not impressed. If you (the bartender) are the owner, I suggest you don't come to work and let everyone else handle it.  The girl that took my credit card was nice.
