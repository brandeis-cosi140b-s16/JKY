This place recently opened near my house, so we figured we'd try it. Went for happy hour street tacos... $1.50 per seemed like a pretty good deal. Walked inside and really enjoyed the look and feel of the place (this is why I gave it two stars). That's pretty much where our excitement stopped. 

The food took forever even though there were only a handful of patrons. The bill came quick though, which was awesome because we couldn't get out of there fast enough. Tried all four street tacos, and they basically tasted the same. No real difference or flavor, unless you added the provided flavored salsa. The rice and beans were extremely underwhelming as well.

I probably will try this place one more time, as it is literally a block away, but I won't be recommending this place to anyone anytime soon.
