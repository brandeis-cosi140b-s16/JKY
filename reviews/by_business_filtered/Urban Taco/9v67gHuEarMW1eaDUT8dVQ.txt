This place is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G.... Starting off with the drinks, everything is fresh- no bottles sour mix here... Try the "Seductive Sip" or "Mexican Maid" - both will impress. Next, try the five salsa sampler; everything was spectacular. Finally, try three different tacos- every bite is different and fresh, homemade and nothing packaged; I still taste mint, avocado and chipotle.....yum!!! Make time to say hello to the owner and his wife- they are always there to make sure you are happy!!!
