This place is ridiculous. Service is Terrible! I ordered only 3 street tacos & it took almost an hour to get. They don't acknowledge you. The manager knows you been sitting there waiting for street tacos & just passed you by when you try to get his attention. This is such a small place, I don't understand why they can't handle the crowd. I will never be back here & I would not recommend anyone coming here either.
