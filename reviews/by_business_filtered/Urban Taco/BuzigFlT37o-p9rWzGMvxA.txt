Was so excited to have a gourmet taco shop within walking distance! Stopped by today to pick up take out and try it out. 
Mmmmmm .... mixed reviews.
It's very cute inside.
The menu isn't as interesting or "gourmet" as I was expecting. And it's expensive for what it is. $5.75 for a bottle of Kiltlifter is a lot. Tacos were $2.50 for street and $4.75 for gourmet. Ouch! I had two short rib street and one braised pork street taco. Liked the poblano strips, but it lacked little flavor without the salsa. The selection and tastes are much better at Taco Guild if you are seeking gourmet.
May try it again, but definitely on HH when the street tacos are $1.50 and beer a dollar cheaper.
