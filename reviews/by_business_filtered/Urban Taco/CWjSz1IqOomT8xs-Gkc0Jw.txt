I came in hungry; it was late in the afternoon and I was just looking to eat..anywhere. I almost passed up this little gem in a nondescript strip mall. I'm glad I didn't. The server was friendly, helpful and conversant. He made some recommendations for a quck not too heavy lunch.
The octopus street taco was delicious, sorry I wasn't hungrier, I wanted more.Vegetable taco-best I've had.
Can't wait to come back, I need to try the short rib taco.
