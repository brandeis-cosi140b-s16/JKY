You can't throw a sombrero in Phoenix without hitting a "modern Mexican" restaurant. They're all branded as gourmet, fusion, and sport the same stained concrete and corrugated iron interiors, minimalist decor and overpriced food. It's a formula that works I guess, although lacking in originality.

Urban Taco fits this mold. Sleek, modern interior? Check. "Gourmet" tacos on the menu? Check. Stained concrete and corrugated iron? Check.

So what sets Urban Taco apart? Why should you come to yet another Modern Mexican place?

THE FOOD. Urban Taco may not be an original concept, but of the myriad Modern Mex places I've been, Urban delivers on the Taco.

Let's start with the salsa. My advice: try them all. Each has its own unique nuance, and they are really what make the tacos here pop. Don't skimp on the salsa.

The food is extremely rich. Listen to these dishes: pork belly and potato, roasted corn and garlic cream, avocado and garlic crema. Extremely heavy and creamy, and every bite is a joy. The Rajas Con Crema De Maize impressed me the most. In keeping with the rest of the menu, it was thick, creamy and rich.

Urban Taco is definitely worth a visit.
