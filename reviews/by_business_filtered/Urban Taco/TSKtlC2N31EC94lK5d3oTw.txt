So So

I wanted to like this new place as I read about it in the Phoenix Magazine, but was disappointed.   Me and a friend went their for lunch and there was only 2 other tables with customers.  Guess we missed the lunch crowd.  We were seated quickly and brought 2 glasses of water.  The waitress seemed slow, disappearing to go to the back for some time. She did not come back to take our order till 10-15 minutes later.  Mind you she only had 3 tables, one which was already done eating and searching for her so they can pay and leave. The chips tasted stale and not warmed up.  We did enjoy the salsas and corn soup. Other than that nothing else was anything to rave about.  Now maybe the waitress was new, or having an off day.  She was very pleasant and thanked us for coming in.  I hope she gets some help, especially when it is busy.  I probably;y will not return or recommend to anyone else.
