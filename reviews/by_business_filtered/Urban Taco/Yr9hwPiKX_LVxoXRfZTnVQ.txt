Went here for lunch with my hubby and my 10 month old. The server was very nice, quickly brought out the high chair and recommended their specialty margarita-that was DELICIOUS!!!  All the tacos we ordered were really good. The octopus, chicken and rib were to die for. The sides of grilled onions and creamed corn were super delish and super cheap. A winning combination of you ask me. We live in the neighborhood and will for sure be back. 
p s.  Even the baby loved the small bites he got to munch on....
