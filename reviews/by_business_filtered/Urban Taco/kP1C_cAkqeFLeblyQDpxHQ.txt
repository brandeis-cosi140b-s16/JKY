Definitely would have to say thumbs down for this place way to small and service at first was good but then the staff did a 360 and turned into bi $@# MOOD was really ridiculous they couldn't even provide extra chairs for a group you would think being in "business" you'd have a plan B but CLEARLY they didn't it basically like saying to a patient at a hospital sorry we don't have any extra beds you'll have to lay there on the floor or I'm sorry you're sick but since we have no seats in the waiting room you'll need to stand NO! It's called customer service DUDE pull something out of your A and make it work way to go man I believe you just messed up your business! In the end it's all about customer service I think all your staff and including you need to take a few classes on customer service
