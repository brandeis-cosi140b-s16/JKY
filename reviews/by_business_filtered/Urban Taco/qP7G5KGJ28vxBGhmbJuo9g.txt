I was looking forward to try this place and on my way to work from a midday appointment I stopped in and order take out.  I waited for about half hour and then got my order. My order was two tacos, rice and beans, when I started eating the tacos were okay but what turned me off was the burnt rice that they gave me and the beans were so, so.  I will try to give them a chance again, hopefully I will get a better meal.
