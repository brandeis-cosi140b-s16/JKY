I was excited to see Urban Taco move into the Central Corridor area. However, not to impressed. The chips were not authentic, I believe they were Tostitos. I tried 3 salsas, the cucumber salsa good concept but  lacked in reasoning and needed a crunch factor or spice. Tried 3 street tacos and all lacked in seasoning. I will say they are definitely better than Americas Tacos. Being Hispanic, please make your own tortilla  chips and SEASON your food, it will make a difference.
