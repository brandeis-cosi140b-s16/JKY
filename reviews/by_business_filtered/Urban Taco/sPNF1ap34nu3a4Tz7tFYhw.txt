Had Friday night dinner - salsas are great, beer selection is limited and they were out of two select beers.  Music is nice, great relaxing, quaint neighborhood place.  If you live in the area it's an easy walk.  Nice bar area. Had the grilled chicken burrito which was nice, but the chicken is not grilled, it's shredded.  They also put paprika all over the rims of every plate which gets all over if you are not careful.  Will definitely come back soon - bring a friend.  We need cool nice restaurants in this neighborhood.
