Loved this place! First impression -  AWESOME. I love hand crafted, rusty, eclectic stuff and this place has just the right amount.  The owner was really nice and made a some of the stuff himself like a old drafting table into a dining table. 



Then the margarita came - pretty decent! Waitress was really attentive. But the food - Salsa sampler was amazing and the Urban Street Taco's were great. I had the short rib, braised pork and octopus asada. The pork was the best and the octopus was a nice spin on street tacos but I'd probably do all pork the next time. 

Really enjoyed everything and the price was right on a saturday afternoon outting with the girls after a fun day Vintage shopping on Cave Creek Road in Phoenix. So glad my friend Christina suggested it!
