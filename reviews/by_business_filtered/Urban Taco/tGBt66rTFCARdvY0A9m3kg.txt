So, I have gone here twice now and had the luxury of being able to try 4 different burritos. The first time when we pulled up we noticed that there was no one else there and it was about noon. Which was kind of weird so we sat in the car for about 5 minutes, no joke, and tried to decide if we should go in. You know, cause it's always a little iffy when there's no one in a place around that time. Anyways, thank goodness we decided to go in! Wow!! 

The place is quite rustic but modern as well and the tables look like well crafted pieces of furniture that look homemade. Same goes for the food! I went with 2 co-workers and we decided to each get a different burrito and cut them in thirds and share. Best idea ever! The three masterpieces were the Costilla, Pollo Asado, and the Pork Verde burritos. The burritos are both packed with flavor and meats and cheeses. They are also grilled which gives then a very nice texture as you take your fork and knife to them (yes they are that big and need to be eaten with a fork). My favorite of those 3 was the short rib, but I would get either of the 3 again, and again! We also sampled 3 of their salsas with chips and all were very flavorful. Some are cream based and some just look/feel cream based because they emulsify them in the blender. 

Well, decided to get some to go a second time a few weeks later and just as impressed as I was the first time. The Baja Shrimp burrito was flavorful and the shrimp was cooked perfectly and wasn't overpowered by the other flavors. 2 different coworkers got the Pollo Asado burrito and the street tacos and both raved about how much they liked them! 

Needless to say, we will be going back. Probably at least once a week as a group. And I may even go again on the weekend! Well done urban taco, well done.
