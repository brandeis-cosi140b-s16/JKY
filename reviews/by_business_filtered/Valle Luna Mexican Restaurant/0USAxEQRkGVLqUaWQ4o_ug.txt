Here for lunch during week day. I ordered chicken burrito lunch special with green Chilli source. I asked to put the cheese aside not on top of the burrito so it doesn't overrun the Chilli source flavor. Also asked for the whole bento bean instead of refried. It was a delightful lunch! Didn't touch the cheese at all.
