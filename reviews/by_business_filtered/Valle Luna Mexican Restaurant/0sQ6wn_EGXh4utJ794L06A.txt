When we walked in here it really felt like a chain Mexican restaurant like 3 Margaritas or On The Border.

They start off by giving you a big bowl of chips and everyone gets their own little bowls of salsa and refried bean dips. I really enjoyed the dips and think I ate every drop of it.

I got the shredded beef chimichanga and I don't remember it wowing me. It tasted fine, but nothing really stood out for me.

The service was another thing that was kinda "meh". It felt like we sat there for a really long time before anyone came by to take our drink order and they didn't come by a ton asking if we wanted refills on our margaritas (which were the one thing that was excellent).
