Margaritas are fantastic!! And I love their salsa and beans that come with the chips.  We usually fight over the beans, I build a fortress around them so people have to plot a plan to get them:) You think I'm kidding... but no. lol 
Last time I was here I had some chilis that were stuffed with shrimp... it was super delicious.  The inside is always clean, but I won't sit outside since I'm deathly afraid of birds, and they are all about the deck here. Cause people feed them! Come on now it's wild life... they need to know not to rely on food from humans. Oh well that's not the restaurants fault.
