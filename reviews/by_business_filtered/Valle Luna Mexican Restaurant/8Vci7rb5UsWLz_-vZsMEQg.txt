My boyfriend introduced me and my girls to this place 2 years ago. It became one of our Go To Places. The service, for the most part, was mediocre. Chasing your waiter to come take your order or get drinks isn't my ideal of great customer service. But we loved going because of the patio sitting and their delicious bean dip which used to be FREE! I understand times are hard and can't always have things for free but to start charging your customer $4.25 for a bean dip, it better come in a large bowl that feeds more than 3 people! If anything, there should be free refills! Otherwise change your price. I never knew refried beans were so costly! You're better off ordering your meal which gives you their rice and beans...and not waste your money on the $4.25 over charged bean dip.  #MediocreService #WhatWasOnceFree #OverPricedBeanDip #ValleLuna
