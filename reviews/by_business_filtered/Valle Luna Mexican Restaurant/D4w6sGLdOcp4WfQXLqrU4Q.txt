Worst service this year at any restaurant in the valley! Our menu was so dirty it had to pried open.  When asked questions he rolled  his eyes like he didn't car.  Both chip plates where dirty along with our silverware. The server never came back to our table after the kitchen server brought the food.  When he showed with the check he never asked if we wanted desert nor why my plate was untouched!  This place was awful!
