Good margaritas and the patio is nice most of the year. The complimentary bean dip is awesome but for the most part the food is fair. My go-to dishes here are the pollo fundito or fish tacos, they have whole pinto beans as a side and they are amazing. Service is hit or miss, the buy one get one coupon in the circular is a bonus!
