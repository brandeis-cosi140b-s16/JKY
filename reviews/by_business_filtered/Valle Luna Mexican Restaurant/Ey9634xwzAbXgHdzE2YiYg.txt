me and a friend started our night out here. we were surprised when at the bar we were offered chips n salsa! so since we had never been here, we were like, really? so, Tomas, the bartender took the chips n salsa and gave it to some customers who arrived later the we did! we promptly got up, informed the manager what had happened, that I would yelp about it, and we would never come back. so we went a few doors down to a sports grill, where I had a great  lub sandwich n a few beers which ill yelp about next. I wont go back to poor customer service.
