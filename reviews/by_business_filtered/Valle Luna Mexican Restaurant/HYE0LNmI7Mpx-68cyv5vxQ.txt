Not sure why the weighted average is 3 stars, this place is a Chandler cornerstone restaurant. Wife & I always have a great time when we go. Salsa & bean dip incredible, entrees to die for (fundido & steak fajitas this time). Attentive staff. Margaritas pretty good. A little pricier that I would have hoped, but the waterfront helps justify. Shop local.
