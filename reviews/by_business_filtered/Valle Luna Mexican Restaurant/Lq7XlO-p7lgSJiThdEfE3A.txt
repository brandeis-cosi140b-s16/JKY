Decided on going here tonight with family. Got a table pretty quick. Was prolly 15 mins before the waiter acknowledged, then about 5 more mins until he came back to take our drink and dinner order. Well 35mins later the food arrives, but during the wait not a single word from waiter as to why so long. The waiter during the meal never checked back to see how everything was. VERY poor service this visit. We go here on a regular basis and we are very disappointed.

We ended up talking with the manager about the server, he was very sorry that we had a bad experience and he took care of some of the items on the bill and offered dessert.

Food as always is very good and we plan on still going there for our monthly Fundido fix,
