Been going to Valle Luna literally for years. Good service good food good happy hour.  Tonight was a beautiful AZ night to enjoy happy hour on the patio.  Except the patio was literally full and more then half the guests enjoying the weather were smoking! Aren't there laws about how far away you can smoke? We sat at the table closest to the door! I smelled like smoke when I left as if I was in a smokey bar! GROSS!
