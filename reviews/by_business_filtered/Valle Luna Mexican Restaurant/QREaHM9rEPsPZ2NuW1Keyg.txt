Had a lunch date with my mom there it was great. It was a first time going and we are definitely going back. The lake view was great. The service was efficient and there wasn't to long of a wait. We loved the food and being from Sonora and them claiming that they have sonoran-style we definitely agreed. They're Chimichangas were delicious.
