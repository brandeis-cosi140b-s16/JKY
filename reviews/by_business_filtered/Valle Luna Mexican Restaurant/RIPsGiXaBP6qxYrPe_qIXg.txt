I loved this place.I usually judge mexican on the staples :rice, chips & salsa and drinks. All of the above rocked. Not only that, but they serve spicy beans to dip your chips in. DELISH! We were seated promptly and with a smile! The waitress was also attentive (making sure our glasses were full) yet not overbearing! 

I had the tacos i could barely finish one but thats because I ate EVERYTHING! :)

A great place for a nice hot meal and a place to converse with your company.
