I am opening a day spa practically right next to this place so after hours of meeting contractors, taking measurements, etc. in our currently empty space my wife and I were ready for a margarita and some good food. So we decided to try one of new neighbors and I have to say that we were very impressed. 

The inside is beautiful with wood beams and little false roofs that make the atmosphere cozy. Of course, the lake is right there which also adds to the atmosphere. Margaritas were $5 on Mondays, which we were happy about because that was number on our list that day. The menu had lots of great choices but we decided to just order two appetizers. We got a mixed mini taco plate and sliders.

Both of our choices were first rate, not greasy, and were served quickly. We thought the service was exceptional. A manager was walking around checking everything the entire time and was actually the one that asked if we wanted a second drink. I always like it when managers are hands on with customers.

My only negative is that one item we ordered was more expensive than we thought. The menu we looked at was for the cantina only, not the main restaurant. Apparently, the cantina has its own specials. I thought that was confusing for a new customer but I don't think they were trying to be misleading at all so I would not knock their rating for that. It was really our fault.

I noticed most of the negative reviews here are old. I thought it was excellent so maybe they changed.
