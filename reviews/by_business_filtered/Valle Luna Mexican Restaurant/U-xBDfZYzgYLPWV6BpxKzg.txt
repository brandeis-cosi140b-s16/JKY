We found our recent dining experience to be most excellent.  The food portions are huge - I could enjoy seeing some smaller meal choices for a less expensive price.  In my opinion, the best value on the menu is the Pollo Sandwich - if you like chicken.  It is easily enough for two people.  I had cheese enchiladas, which were very good, but a bit too cheesy and needed more sauce.  Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.  I hope to have room next time to try some delicious fried ice cream.  Yum!
