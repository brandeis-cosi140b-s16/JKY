OMG, this place is amazing!
We had a hard time finding a table for 7 of us and ended up with something less than pleasing.  The female waitress was irritated with me and you could tell she clearly did not want to wait on us, so a young waiter, I think his name is Jeff, took her place.  He was wonderful, catering to our every want and need, the food was, of course wonderful.  We will continue to come here; however, avoiding the waitress with the attitude problem.
