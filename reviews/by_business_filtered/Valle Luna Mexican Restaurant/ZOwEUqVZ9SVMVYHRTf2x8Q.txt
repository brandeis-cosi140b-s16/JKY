Normally when my husband and I visit Valle Luna we split an order of the fajitas and order the queso dip. Last night we had a buy one get one free coupon so we got separate orders.  They were pretty much was the same thing except I got the smothered burrito and he got the enchiladas. I thought that the meat was a little spicy for me but I still ate it. The burrito skin was not warm at all and it was pretty dry. My husbands enchiladas looked better than my dish!  Also I ordered guacamole with mine-$2.50! 

I'm sure we'll come back, but next time I'm ordering the fajitas and queso dip!!!
