This has been our favorite Mexican restaurant in town since I can remember! The chips and salsa is fantastic-very fresh salsa. Their appetizers are a good price and generally a great size. I recommend the mini taco basket. Get it half chicken/half beef. They also have a nice red sauce for the enchiladas.

A friend of mine did their rehearsal dinner on the patio and had a great time. Nice place for after work dinner or a bigger get together!
