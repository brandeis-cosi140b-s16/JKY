Big Fan. . . 

I have been here numerous times throughout the years and can't believe i never wrote a review sooner.  I love this place.  This location is excellent.  It sits right on the water so when the weather is nice the patio seating cannot be beat.   Every time I have been here the service is always excellent.   

The food is great.  I usually order the Machaca Burro De la Casa with rice a beans and each time I am left satisfied.  Also just in case you prefer Black beans instead of Pinto or Re-fried.  Those are very good as well and have become my preferred choice of late.  

For me personally this is one of the better Mexican Restaurants in the area and I would much rather drive here then each at Nandos which is closer to my home.  

The only downside for others who have been here in past years. . They used to offer you bean dip with your chips and salsa, but not anymore.  Now they will charge you $4.00 as if its an appetizer dish and while it is good, for me it isn't' worth it. 

Other than that, enjoy the food and the view.
