Their $5 margaritas are always the perfect start to any night out! 

Service and cleanliness definitely leaves room for improvement. The bartender we has wasn't very friendly and engaging, and the surrounding tables were filled with crumbs from the chips and salsa. So this isn't exactly where I would spend a good portion of my night, but staying for one or two drinks was fine.
