bland bland bland!

If you like Mexican food with no taste then this is the place to go.  The salsa tasted like tomato sauce, the bean dip had no flavor, and I don't think I've ever had a more tasteless chile relleno in my life.  Not even the pepper had any taste.  The whole plate was covered in cheese and mediocre rice and beans.  I did like the small side of guacamole, the only thing I liked at the table.

The service was lackluster and seemed to match up with the food here.  

What I did like was that it sits right on a small lake and I would imagine in nicer weather it would be fun to drink margaritas and sit by the water.
