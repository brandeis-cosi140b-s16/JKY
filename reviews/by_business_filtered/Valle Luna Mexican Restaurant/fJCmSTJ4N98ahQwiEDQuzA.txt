The food here is predictably good, not great. It does not display depth of flavor or creative anything. The portions are large and the view of the cement lake,  well... It's a good deal if you are over 50/55 on a Tuesday the second entr√©e is 50% off, The service is good.
Sadly, their signature bean dip is no longer served gratis with the salsa. It is still available but you pay for it. That was actually my favorite thing about the place. The margs are really good and the bar always hopping. They must have a decent happy hour.
