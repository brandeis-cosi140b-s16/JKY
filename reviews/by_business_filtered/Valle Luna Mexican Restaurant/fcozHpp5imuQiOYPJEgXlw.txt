Fundito was good...not great.  I got it with pork.  The pork was cooked perfectly...nice and moist.  

My wife's bean & cheese burrito was bland (at best).  She wasn't impressed at all.

The salsas (both mild and hot) were flavorless and runny.  The hot tasted like Ketchup with a small bit of spice.  We even had some of the bean dip...not so good.  The chips were greasy too.

Valle Luna used to be some of the *BEST* Mexican food around... What happened?!?!?!?!
