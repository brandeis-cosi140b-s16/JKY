Sue had the spinach enchiladas and I had the fajitas. Both meals came out quickly, they were hot, fresh with just enough spices. Our waitress, Erin, was friendly, attentive, and professional. Look for coupons, they always have a BOGO out there. But, be sure you take care of your server and tip on the full amount!
