I've been going to Valle Luna ever since I can remember!! They have awesome salsa but not awesome chips. The bean dip is a hit or miss, it depends on who makes it that day. The pollo fundido is my favorite... even though it cost like $15 and an extra $3 for a side of the jalapeno cream cheese. I also recommend the pollo sandwich and the grilled honey-hot wings!
Now about the service... it's terrible!!! A lot of the servers have worked at Valle Luna for many years and treat NO ONE with respect. They treat customers like they are an inconvenience then wonder why they don't get good tips lol.
