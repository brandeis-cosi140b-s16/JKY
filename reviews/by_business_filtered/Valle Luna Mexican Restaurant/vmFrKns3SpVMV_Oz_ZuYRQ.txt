Visited today after the hubby went with his co workers for lunch. I have to say, I'm impressed. Service was great, the food was excellent, happy hour specials are every day and even my son finished his food. When we were leaving, we saw one of my husband's co worker's who is particularly picky when it comes to Mexican food...so he def must've approved because he came back with his wife!

We'll def be back again.
