I am not a big Mexican food fan to begin with, so take this review with a grain of salt.  My fiance, her family and a few friends decided to eat here when we saw that it was featured restaurant on Restaurant.com.  Each couple printed out our coupons as we were all going to pay separately.  Everything was going great, the service was fast and courteous and the food was good, but when it came to paying for our check we were told that they would only honor one coupon since we were all sitting at the same table, even though we alerted our waiter to the fact that we were all paying separately and he said that would be fine.  After a few tense minutes with the manager, he reluctantly agreed to accept the coupons.  Aside from that the experience was okay.  The party I was with really likes Mexican food, so I'm sure they would rate it higher.  I had the shrimp fajitas I would rate as a 6 compared to the best shrimp fajitas I have ever had.
