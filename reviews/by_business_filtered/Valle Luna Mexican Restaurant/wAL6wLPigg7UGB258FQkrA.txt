THE ONLY PLACE I GO TO FOR MEXICAN!

Let me start off first by saying that there is a server that works there named Jill and she is like this precious, sweet, wonderful lady who ALWAYS knows what me and my boyfriend want when she see's us! We just love her so much! She ROCKS!

The staff there seem to have worked there for a long time which always says a lot to me. The chips and salsa are good - but the bean dip? Oh man! I am in love with their bean dip! The atmosphere is really nice and the view is really nice to (over looks a little man made pond with a fountain in the middle.). Me and my boyfriend always order the same thing - the minnie taco basket, beef, with no tomatoes - and we always walk out stuffed and happy. They use shredded beef that is so juicy and flavorful! 

Sometimes I am disappointed with the wait staff because certain servers aren't really on top of things, even on a slow day. But, my boyfriend and I don't let that impede out love for the minnie tacos and delicious bean dip!

I will be a patron for forever (or least until I don't live in Phoenix anymore)!
