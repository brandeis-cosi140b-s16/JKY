My husband and I recently took out-of-town visitors to Valle Luna based on our past experience of it being a great local spot with great food, but I doubt we will return after our newest experience. We arrived just prior to the evening rush, and were quite surprised by the staff's lack of prioritization skills as we sat in the entry at least 15 minutes while others who arrived after us requiring seating for 5 were seated before us. When we inquired about this, the hostess proceeded to seat us near the smelly restroom, with other suitable booths in plain sight. Unfortunately, the odor overshadowed any quality of food that may have been there. Needless to say, my husband and I were mortified by the staff's haphazard treatment, especially since we had recommended the restaurant so highly to our guests. Valle Luna used to be our favorite local spot, but I doubt it will be on our short list of preferred places to go the next time we are asked to recommend a restaurant. We are very disappointed since that evening was to be the last get together before one of our guests deploys to Afghanistan.
