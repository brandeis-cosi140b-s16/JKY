Patio is the place to be. If you want to go eat/drink in the bar it can get pretty packed. It seems that every time I go there I have to muscle my way through the bar and struggle to find a table, or place at the bar. 

Food is average. I have had way better, but it goes down and taste alright. Good Mexican beer selection and margaritas( which is my main reason for visiting). They are not the best, but certainly not the worst and their happy hour prices make it more appealing. You do get chips/salsa/jalapeno bean dip which can feel you up. 

They do have this taco bar. I am not sure if it is free, or really cheap but I have sat by it before and it looks pretty gross. If you want tacos get the mini taco basket. 

Certainly not the worst for food or drinks, but not even close to being the best.
