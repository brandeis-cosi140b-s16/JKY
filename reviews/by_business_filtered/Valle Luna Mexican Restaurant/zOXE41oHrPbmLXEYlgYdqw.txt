We eat here so that our four year old son can play out by the lake with the ducks. The chicken salad is huge and very good for the price. We usually sit in the bar area for the happy hour prices. The food is normal for mexican. Nothing special but still the best place to go. The only down side. If you want to sit outside, you will be surrounded by ducks. Other than that, a good place to go.
