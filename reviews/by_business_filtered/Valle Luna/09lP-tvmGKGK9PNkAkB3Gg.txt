I have been here several times as I have a friend that lives two blocks away.  The secret to Valle Luna's success is that they serve food that is predictable.  Anglos have embraced this place for years because it is safe. It will not challenge your palate with unusual or unique spices or tastes.  The clientele most nights look like people who consider Applebee's to be Haute Cuisine ....the real reason they are always busy is each month they send out two for one coupons in our local mailers. 
So it makes for a cheap lunch or dinner.  And I applaud this marketing coup.   No coupon no Valle Luna!   Service has always been good and they move fast and are attentive
