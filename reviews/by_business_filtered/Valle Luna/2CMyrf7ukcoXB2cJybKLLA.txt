I hadn't been to this location in several years.  We went and I thought it was fantastic!  We went on Cinco de Mayo at lunch and it was pretty busy.  But they seated us right away.  We had great service and the food was wonderful.  I was happy to see lunch specials on a Saturday.  Normally lunch specials are week days only.  The prices were great.  I thought the salsa was great.  We received a regular and a hot.  We mixed them together and it was perfect.
