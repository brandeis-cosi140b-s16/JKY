Checked this place out based on a friends recommendation.  It's usually a good sign when the parking lot is free of any vacant spots.

It has a nice ambience and the noise level is very tolerable.  Our waiter was very attentive and recommended both of our dishes.  (Fundido Burrito & Mexican Pizza)      Mexican pizza was very greasy - but still good.  Fundido burrito - cheese sauce - was really good.

Salsa was good - reminded my wife of her favorite Mexican restaurant's in Tucson - Mi Nidito. 

Prices on the food were a bit steep for this style of restaurant.  However the drink prices made up for it.  

Probably the best Mexican food we've had since we relocated to the valley from the Dirty T.
