I used to really enjoy this restaurant.....
In high school 10 years ago.. We recently made a special visit to celebrate a birthday with a party of 13.. When we called to make a reservation, they informed us that they didn't make them.. So we showed up half an hour earlier than we wanted to make sure our party could get a table only to find out that apparently a party that large required a reservation and the wait was over an hour.. When I asked who answered the phones the young idiot lady said it's always different.. I asked her to explain herself about reservations and she sounded like she was high with her explanation of that they sometimes make them and sometimes don't and tonight they had 4 but sometimes don't use them.. I told her she made absolutely no sense at all!!! It was embarrassing to listen to her speak.. Half of out party had arrived by this point and we called Top Shelf down the street and they said they could get us right in so we told them we were leaving and were not happy with their service and they didn't care.. At any rate, we walked in the door at Top Shelf with 13 people (two children) and were seated right away.. Unacceptable.. No matter if their restaurant is always busy or not, this should have been rectified prior to us leaving..
