It's americanized versions of mexican food.  Don't go here if you're looking for the real thing, only the american-washed version of the real thing.  The wait staff is usually pretty ok, but the hostesses are by far the worst.  I don't understand how they even got jobs as the face of the restaurant/first person you see when you walk into the establishment.  They always seem to be teenage girls who are too busy talking to each other to give a damn about customers coming in.  When they do turn around to service you, they act like you're ruining their day instead of paying them their paychecks.  :P Also, if you're under 65 I don't recommend going during the day, it's a Senior Citizens playground before happy hour.
