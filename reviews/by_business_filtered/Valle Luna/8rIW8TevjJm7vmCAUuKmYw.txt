I almost don't want to write a positive review, because the place is busy enough as it is. But hell, I eat here once a week or more so I can't not say good things.

The long and short of it is come into the bar area during happy hour (which runs till a very convenient 7:30pm, and ALL day on Sundays). The bar food is fantastic and outrageously cheap. I don't know what it is, but these are likely my favorite tacos ever. The drinks are super cheap and great too. $4.50 for a 16oz house margarita? $3 Dos Equis pints? Yes please. They've also got plenty of TVs in the bar so if there is a game you're after you'll likely find it.

Overall, it's a great place. The only thing keeping it from 5-stars is that its always crazy busy, and finding parking is a nightmare (we live close enough so its usually easiest to just walk for us). The crowd as expected can cause some delays in service speed or even worse the ability to get a table at all.
