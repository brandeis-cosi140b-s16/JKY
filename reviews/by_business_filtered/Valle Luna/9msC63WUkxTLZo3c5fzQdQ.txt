This place was  recommended to me.as soo. As we walked in we were seated immediately. I had the Fundido which is on special for $11.95 on Thursdays I ate about 1/2 of it and was stuffed. It was soo good. The rice was amazing as well. I tried to eat as much as possible. The waitress came immediately to the table and was very friendly. I will definitely go back anytime I return to Arizona.
