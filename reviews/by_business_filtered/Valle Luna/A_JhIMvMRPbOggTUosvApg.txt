Had dinner on Thursday 8/30/12. Ordered a ground beef chimi and two taco plates. Jennifer, our server, gave us excellent service. Unfortunately the chimi was so so and the tacos were cold. We sent the tacos back and the next orders were warm with the first bite and also cold in the middle. Obviously management doesn't care when someone receives horrible food because no one came by to see if they could do anything or    If we wanted something else. We won't eat here again.
