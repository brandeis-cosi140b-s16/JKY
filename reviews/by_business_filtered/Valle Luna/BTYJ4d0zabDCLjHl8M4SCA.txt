I've been going to Valle Luna since I was a little kid, but this recent trip was a little disappointing.  They have good salsa, but the chips were terribly greasy.  The cheese crisp was also too greasy, and not that crisp, while the guacamole was okay, but nothing special.  Although the waiter at first brought a hard taco when I had asked for soft, the chicken taco was probably the best part of the meal, with juicy and flavorful chicken.  Valle Luna has been a long-time Valley favorite for Sonoran Mexican food, but it's not quite what it used to be.
