Love this place.  Have been coming here forever.  The happy hour food menu is amazing and is offered almost all day Saturday which is a huge plus and pretty rare.  Everything on the menu is good.  My problem is I almost always order the Carne or Pollo Fundido.  Both are amazing.  Best Fundido I have ever tasted.  

Great place to stop in on the way home for work for some chips and salsa and a big beer or margarita and a tasty appetizer.  Or come on the weekend and stay all day!  Bartenders and staff are always super friendly and funny.
