Visiting Phoenix for training class and staying in the somewhat sterile north end overrun with national chain restaurants, I was really hoping to find something local to experience rather than something I can get anywhere at home. I found the Valle Luna almost by accident but was especially impressed with the bar they have. The food is great. Try their red chili in a burrito or enchilada. The green chile and corn tamale was really good as are their tacos and machaca beef. What made the bar so special is it was always busy with really friendly people, something nice about Phoenix, the people are genuinely friendly. The staff was also really friendly and helpful, There are lots of TV screens so you can watch the sport of your choice from almost any seat in the place. Food and drinks are served soon after you order them. I will truly miss this place! It was a delightful experience in Phoenix and I would go out of my way to go there should I end up in Phoenix again.
