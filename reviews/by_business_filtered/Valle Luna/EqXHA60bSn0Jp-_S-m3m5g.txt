Ugh. Well, I should add this disclaimer first: I've never really had muchmMexican food in Arizona that I like. Am I crazy, you ask? No. I am a Colorado girl, who likes Colorado and New Mexican-style Mexican food.

This place is greasy. I've had better at other places. They were nice, but I feel like I need an oil change now. 

We will not go back.

I even just brushed my teeth to try and get the taste out of my mouth. Pepto could be in my future.

I have friends who like this place a lot, but they also like their food a lot more greasy than I do.

This is a good place if you like grease.

*shudder*
