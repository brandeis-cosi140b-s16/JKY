I created my yelp account just to review this restaurant. I was there last night (Saturday April 11, 2015) and had excellent service from the server, Cody. I am a server myself and think this young kid deserves some recognition. He was fantastic. He was clearly busy with parties and it being a Saturday night but he never showed it. I have not received such great customer service in a while. He was just a delight! The food was great too but honestly I will return just for the wonderful service! Thanks Cody.. Keep it up!
