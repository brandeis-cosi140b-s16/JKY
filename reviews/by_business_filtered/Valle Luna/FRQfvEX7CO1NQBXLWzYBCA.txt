Valle Luna has always been amazing but tonight we came here for a quick bite after unpacking and my hubby had what we would probably say is the best thing on the menu! 

He ordered the Sonoran enchilada dinner with red pork and let me tell you it was ABSOLUTELY fantastic! We should have taken a picture of it before he devoured it, but it's a little too late! We definitely recommend it!
