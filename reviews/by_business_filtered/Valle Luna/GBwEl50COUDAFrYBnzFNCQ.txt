Got a coupon for my birthday and we had to use it! My friend and I ordered the chicken chimi with rice and beans, and a half order of steak nachos to share. Everything was delicious! Enjoyed the chips and salsa, as always, and service was good. Valle Luna has redeemed itself as my favorite Mexican place!
