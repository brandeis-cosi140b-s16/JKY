This is my favorite Mexican food place in all of Phoenix. If I recall, this is the original Valle Luna as well. I've been eating here for as long as I can remember.

The restaurant is quiet and comfortable. It's a very basic restaurant. You can go in and eat your own meal for $8-15 no problem. The servers have always been friendly. I have never had a mistake on my order. The salsa they have to go with the chips is excellent and the food is even better.

Unfortunately, they recently changed the menu. Prices have gone up a bit. Oh well, I can deal with that. It's still worth it.

The separate bar is also pretty cool. They don't have any huge TVs--it's no Santisi Brothers--but there's enough that you can watch all of the major games at the same time. The place brings in some dedicated Cardinals fans as well. They've been doing caravans to the games on Sundays for awhile.

Overall, it's just a quiet, affordable, friendly local restaurant that happens to have what I consider to be the best Mexican food in the valley. The next time you're in there, do yourself a favor and get the Fundido, preferably with chicken. It's sort of like a Chimichanga covered with cream cheese then covered with a layer of cheddar cheese and is the main reason I keep going back. Easily one of my favorite dishes in the city.

It's a shame I live so far from this place now.
