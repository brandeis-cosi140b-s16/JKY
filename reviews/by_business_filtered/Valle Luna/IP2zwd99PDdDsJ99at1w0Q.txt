I came on a Tuesday evening and since I am over 50 (barely) dinner was 1/2 off. Amazing. The waitress recommended a Chimichanga with shredded beef.  Loved it. And the white death margarita was great and it was pretty big. Good stop. I recommend this place if you are looking for a friendly family Mexican restaurant.  Bill came to $15.  What a deal!
