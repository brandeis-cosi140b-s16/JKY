Service is kind of slow. It seemed like our waitress was serving the entire little section we were in, so I could understand that, but the extra help probably wouldn't have hurt considering how big this place is. 
The food is average, it really isn't anything to get excited over. Popos on 51st and bell is much better in terms of food. We only came here since we had a groupon... One thing this restaurant needs to do is bring in spoons for dips and salsas. We had a group of 6 who passed around the cheese dip (which seized up after about 10 minutes...) And a spoon would've been great.
Also, music choice is weird... This is a Mexican restaurant right? Some Mexican music would've been better instead of hearing Katy Perry telling me I'm a firework.
The sad thing is I used to love this place as a child, but compared to other places it's just... mediocre. 
All-in-all I probably won't be back here unless there's a groupon or something.
