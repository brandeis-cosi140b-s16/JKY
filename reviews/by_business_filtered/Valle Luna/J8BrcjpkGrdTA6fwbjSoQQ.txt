Wednesday nights! Family night! $8 specials!!! It's a ton of food for very little pocketbook. There's plenty of selection to choose from - I got the taco, enchilada, and tamale special with rice and beans. Way too much food for 1 sitting, especially when I've been munching on those addicting chips and salsa. Can't wait to go back.
