This my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE restaurant!

I love to go to Valle Luna when I am craving some good Mexican food. It has even become somewhat of a family tradition as we go there for birthdays and family dinners.

While you look over the menu, you are served with hot tortilla chips and their special recipe salsa. You get unlimited chips and salsa, but make sure not to fill up on them before your meal like I always do!

I love to get the fajitas, they are the best in town. They serve a steamy hot skillet with your choice of pork, beef, chicken or a combo of all three, along with peppers, onions and tomatoes. There is also a side plate with all the "fixings" like sour cream, guac, cheese, refried beans and rice and of course, warm tortillas. You can ask for extra of any of these items if you'd like also, especially if you love cheese and sour cream as much as I do. It is a bit pricey, but there is plenty of food to go around for 2-3 people or take home for great left overs!

When I am craving something a bit smaller (and less costly) I love to get the Bandito Burros located on the appetizer menu. You get 8 mini deep fried burritos with guac and sour cream. I've shared this appetizer with friends a few times and everyone always seem to enjoy them as much as I do. 

Parking can be somewhat of a pain if you go during their dinner rush times. The outside appearance is also nothing to be impressed by nor is the inside decor as it is a bit outdated. Nonetheless, the food and friendly service always keep me coming back!!!
