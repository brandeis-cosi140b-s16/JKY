I called Valle Luna eight days before my husbands 50th birthday and ordered 4 ultimate party platters and fruit and veggie platters.  I cannot believe all of the food we got!  Although we did not have quite as many people as I had thought, we had a LOT of food left over.  It was well worth it.

I would also like to commend the service I got.  I feel terrible, but I cannot recall the name of the gentleman with whom I spoke to finalize my order.  He asked me how many people I was having and he said that I only needed half of the fruit and veggies that I had ordered for how many people I was planning on - which saved me almost $200.  

It happened to be the same gentleman who brought the food to my house and he helped get everything set up and assisted me with some good suggestions.

I definitely will be ordering from Valle Luna again if I am having a party!

Thanks so much!
