We were not welcomed with a smile.   Just a young girl doing her "job".  As we were seated in the back room we walked by 5 booths that were empty but not cleared of their dirty dishes.  (yuck) There seemed to be lots of help but no one was cleaning.  The place was noisy and the floors were very dirty.   The back room where we seated was small and looked like a supply closets.  Even some kind of big bucket sitting on some clean up table and a broom leaning up against the wall. Our table had spilled liquid on it that we pointed out and the hostess just grabed some napkins and wiped it off quickly.  The service was good and we liked out server until she took my drink for a refill.  I saw her carry my empty glass and another glass from another table away touching so I assumed I would get a fresh glass.  Upon returning I got my glass ( hopefully) with my straw in it. They originally served my drink and gave me a wrapped straw.
The food overflowed the plate which did not look good and it was almost tasteless.  Two dinners and one lemonade was over $27 without tip.  As we left we walked by 5 young men workers near a front desk all talking to each other.  No one thanked us nor asked us to come again.  We will NOT go again.
