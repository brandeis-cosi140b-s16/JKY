First time at this location (have visited the bell road location many times) & I was extremely disappointed. I ordered some chicken sandwich thing that came without the flavored mayo I was excited for so the sandwich was bland & my potato cake that came on the side was near frozen in the middle & inedible. & I had to stare at a dirty table next to use that wasn't cleaned the whole time we were there. Will never go back to this location!
