Average mexican restuarant which has a lot of retired clients due to specials (buy one get one free) type.  Place is always packed but not because of the food at least for me.  I had their enchilladas and they only make them in red sauce.  My wife had the fish tacos and she liked those.  Would not be returning, there are better authentic places out there.
Update:
I have to say that the manager reached out to me.  Seems these people care about their customers and for this I will give them another star!
