We have been coming to Valle Luna for many years.  It's a good thing that we travel so far to get here,  or we might go here daily,  which would be hard on the wallet and the waistline!     You can always count on it being because the food is so great.   We have never had anything but great food.  Same is true for the service.  Service normally is fairly fast, but you are never hustled to leave.

Portions are large,  perhaps accounting for slightly higher prices.   They have great specials Tuesday,  Wednesday and Thursday nights. 

If you have room for desert,  get their wonderful sopapliias, be sure to ask for the caramel sauce.
