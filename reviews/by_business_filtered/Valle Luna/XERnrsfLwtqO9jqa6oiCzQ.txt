Sit in the bar, they have best staff and the Happy Hour is amazing.  My entire family is here at least once a week due to HH and the staff.  Brian, Joe, Dese, Ashley, Stevie... This place wouldn't be the same without them.  Because of the amazing experience I have brought my team from work, 15+.  They agree they have never been so taken care of in a restaurant before.
