Only been here once, a Thursday night.  It was very busy (usually a good sign) and we waited 15 min for a table.  Had good chips/salsa, took a few minutes to get our drinks, then once we ordered food was out in maybe 15 minutes at the most.  I have chicken tacos, they were good.  I wasn't blown away by anything, but everything was solid.  I will definitely be going back, and would be willing to amend my review to 4 stars if they have a few spectacular items.
