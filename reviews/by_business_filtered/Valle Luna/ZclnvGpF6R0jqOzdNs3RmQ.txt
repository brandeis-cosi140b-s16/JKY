If you want real authentic Mexican food, you're better off enjoying your mother's home cooking than at this restaurant. There was nothing spectacular about this place...the price range was incredibly expensive for what it is. 

Example: 
$15 for a Chimichanga
$12 for a quesadilla
Really?? That is ridiculous.
