The food here is pretty dang delicious.  It tastes like something that I would make at home, and I am a dang good cook!!  The boyfriend took me here on date night last night and for 7:30pm on a Friday, we only waited for about 10 min for a table.  You can make a reservation if you have 8 or more people (FYI).  I ordered a margarita on the rocks and it wasn't too bad.  The chimichanga was really really good!!  I branched out from enchiladas and I wasn't disappointed.  Next time I want to try their tamales.  Our waiter was great.  He wasn't super chirpy and annoying (don't get me wrong- I love nice people but the super peppy dutch brother workers are the only ones that don't make me cringe) and he got everything right.  Very pleasant!!
Their salsa is my favorite.  I love cilantro and theirs has a perfect amount!!   I really couldn't have asked for a better night or better service.
