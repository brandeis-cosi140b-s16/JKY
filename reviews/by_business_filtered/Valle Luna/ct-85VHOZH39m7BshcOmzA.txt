I went in on 6/4/15 to grab take out and get back to work. The food was tasty, but I was disappointed that they failed to include napkins or utensils in my take out bag. I went on their site to provide this feedback directly, but they do not have a 'contact us' section. Next time I'm in a hurry for a quick lunch, I'll be choosing another restaurant.
