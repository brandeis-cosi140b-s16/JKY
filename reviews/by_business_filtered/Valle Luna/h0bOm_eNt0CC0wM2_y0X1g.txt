Have been here several times in the past few years. Most recent trip was Friday night with a couple girlfriends. I had a $25 gift certificate from restaurant.com & decided to use it, such an awesome deal! 

We started out with some drinks. I had a strawberry Patron margarita & it was tasty. Jessica had some cocktail with Sweet Tea vodka & it was so good. Vanessa had a Michelob Ultra, can't go wrong there. Their chips & salsa are standard but pretty good. We all ordered way too much food, I think we were more in the mood to drink than eat (we were heading out to the bars afterwards). For dinner: Vanessa ordered their cheese crisp with chicken, Jessica ordered their bean & cheese burrito & I ordered their chicken chimichanga. The portions were HUGE so we left with 3 FULL to go containers. Oh & I forgot her name, but our server was so sweet & not at all bitchy about me using the g.c. 

Overall, I like Valle Luna & will continue to come here for some yummy Mexican food!
