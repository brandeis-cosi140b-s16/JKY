Excellent visit to Valle Luna Friday night. The parking lot was completely full, but we managed to grab a spot in the front as someone was leaving. The hostess told us 10-15 min, but we only waited about 5. They removed the big take-out counter in the waiting area and put in more seating since we were last here, so it seems a bit more roomy. They also took a lot of the pictures/plaques down. The chips were really good! Tasted fresh and delicious. I got the chicken chimi (no garnish or guac) with rice and beans. It was awesome! Also had a few of my boyfriend's steak nachos... so yummy. Used our buy-one-get-one coupon. Got iced teas to go. Kayla was a very good server. My only problem with this meal was that I ate too much!
