Greeted with the stench of bathroom disinfectant and stale grease at the front door. This place obviously has a neighborhood following that is accustomed to the odors. For a quick lunch ordered an ala carte chile Relleno. The single worst relleno I've been served from LA to AZ, Albuquerque to Oklahoma City. It was saturated in oil and had the charred chile skin left on. The salsa and taco sauce served with the chips tasted  bland and canned. Just a poor choice for Mexican food when there are so many other restaraunts.
