Our family has been going to Valle Luna for many years and has never once had a bad experience.  Most recently we drove 30-40 minutes to eat dinner there with our kids and some other family.  The wait is long but that's to be expected... They're popular!  We were given amazing service by an older server and come to find out, this server has worked there for a very long time.  In the restaurant business, it's rare to see someone stay at one place for a long time so we were impressed.  Food was as great as always!  Order their pollo fundido.  Yummmmy!
