Oh oh.......... What the heck happened? Been a customer of the Luna for as long as I can remember.  Went there yesterday with my daughter and niece who was visiting from out of town. For lunch I asked if they could incorporate some shrimp into my dish.  Server went and asked and said no.  Hmmmmm really, willing to pay a little something extra for a few shrimp, but the answer was still no. I guess they lost their flexibility to satisfy the customer.  Asked for the manager (Kelly), and she said the shrimp came pre packaged.  WHAT? Pre packaged individual servings at my favorite Mex restaurant? And would not open one ?   I asked how much for a serving and the manager (Kelly) had no idea? WHAT a manager who could not tell me how much an item was on the menu.  Bottom line, no shrimp, crappy service, manager could care less about a long time returning customer. She (Kelly) walked away from the table without a resolution. No more visits to the cave creek location for me. Ugghhhhhh showed my niece what western hospitality was for sure.  Thanks Kelly!
