Valle Luna has always been one of my favorite restaurants. We get buy one, get one free coupons in the mail so we try to go once a month. We met my parents there for lunch today and they were pretty busy. They sat us back in the Cortez area where I have never sat before in all my years of coming here. It was a little noisy back there but once the family with the kids next to us left, it was a lot quieter. Our table was a little wobbly (pet peeve) and I thought it smelled a little strange in there... like cleaning products? I'd rather smell fajitas. But the chips & salsa were good as always, and I ordered my usual: two chicken enchiladas with rice & beans and no garnish. The food was delicious as always, although there were a lot more onions inside than normal. Took one enchilada home with me to eat the next day. Service was good up until the end, it took her awhile to bring us the check. But overall, a good meal. I wish there was a Valle Luna in the west valley!
