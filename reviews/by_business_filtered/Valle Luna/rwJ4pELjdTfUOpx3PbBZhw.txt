Valle Luna has quintessential Americanized Mexican food... and sometimes that's just what I crave.  My hubby and I stop by when we get the hankering for a cheap Mexican beer or a margarita.  We always eat in the bar because they always have good drink  specials and they have TV's on every wall that are easily seen at pretty much every seat.  The food is nothing amazing, but I like the chunky salsa and the beans.  Although we've had several different servers, our orders have been messed up multiple times.  We don't mind it as much though, because the servers are always apologetic and quickly remedy the situation.
