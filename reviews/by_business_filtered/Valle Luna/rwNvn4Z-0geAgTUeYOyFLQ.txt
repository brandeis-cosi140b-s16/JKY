In the search to quash a craving for some good chips & salsa.. I was told to try this place out.. and as my gps was taking too long to find me.. and where Im going?!.. I took the advice of a wise..and 'should be ..would be yelper'.. and made the left on Cave Creek.. Loved the chips.. Im quite picky about my chip texture and salsa spice and texture too.. Even opted for a ala carte chicken taco..service a bit slow.. but all in all Im a fan:-)
