This was not our first trip to this resturant. They always have some kind of promotional going on which usually keeps the resturant full. Tonight when we arrived we were seated quickly. There were several large groups waiting. The resturant is made up of many rooms all decorated with a mexican theme. We were waited on by Matt. He was attentive and took very good care of us. As with most Mexican Food resturants you start out with chips and salsa. Their salsa is a little more spicy than most. I like it hot so this is fine with myself. They also offer a hotter version.  I had their Chili Verde. I have eaten it several times before and it is one of my favorites.  It comes with rice and beans. There is very good quanity as well as quality. You will not go away hungry. Our dinning experience was pleasent and we went away full. I would definitely recomment Valley Luna.
