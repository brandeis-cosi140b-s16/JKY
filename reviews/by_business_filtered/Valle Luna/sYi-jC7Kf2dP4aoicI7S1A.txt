I don't know what it will take for us to lose faith in this place...
We come here every so often when we are not very creative with dinner options... and if it is in a Friday we always hate the limited parking : ( the wait : ( and the so so food.

We had a certificate this time, so it was a hell of a deal.
And, our server Charity was outstanding. She was really friendly and helpful.

We ordered the asada/chorizo tacos as appetizer (Pepe's border tacos), they were OK but we didn't love them. The meat/chorizo portion was generous though... and it came with a chile toreado, which I love.

Then we shared sizzling beef fajitas. The beans are so so, and there is something about the rice that I don't like... not sure if it is cumin... 

Daughter had shrimp fajitas, which seemed to be just a few shrimp in a sea of onion and peppers, but I still think it was a reasonable portion. At least they don't charge extra if you order shrimp.

I do like how they present the cheese, guacamole and the sour cream in a cute small tortilla shell.

Side note:
***Self fulfilling prophecy?
As a working family, we try what we can to make our dollars go further... I use the Entertainment Book, coupons mailed to us, restaurant.com certificates, etc. And one of the reasons I love this (other than the savings) is that it is because of coupons and certificates that we have found wonderful places that we may have not even noticed otherwise.
However, sometimes the service is just awful. And I am starting to believe it may be because servers may have the impression that people using coupons are stingy, and bad tippers... however, we are not... we routinely tip 20% or even more if we round up. Unless, of course, the service is terrible... food for thought...
