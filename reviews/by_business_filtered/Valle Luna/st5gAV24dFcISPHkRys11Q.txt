Valle Luna was recommended to me by a colleague while traveling on business to Phoenix, Arizona.  Needless to say: I visited Valle Luna at least two more times later that week.

Each visit, there was a small wait - At least 10 to 15 minutes.  There is, however, plenty of room, both inside and outside, to wait.

Once seated, chips and salsa were received at the table almost instantly.  Each time, the waiter or waitress was shortly behind to gather my table's drink order.  On one visit, I had the high-end margarita with top-shelf tequila, which comes served in a mason jar, but is average amongst other margaritas I have had.

The chips always came to the table warm; although on at least one occasion, we seemed to have gotten the last batch of chips for the day (there were few that were whole).  The salsa has a ton of flavor, but not very much heat.

I have had several dishes during my visits to Valle Luna, and although a single one does not stand out more than the other, I can say that the fajitas are really good (who can mess up grilled chicken and steak?!).

A word of caution: Valle Luna's food seems to expand in the stomach, which can and *will* catch up with you!  I have made several attempts to be coherent of my food intake in an effort to avoid overeating, but it never did work.
