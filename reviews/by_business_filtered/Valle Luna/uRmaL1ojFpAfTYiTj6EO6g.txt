I'm a huge fan of "Sunday Funday" in Valle Luna's cantina. It's happy hour all day and they have good specials. The $4.50 Margarita is my favorite drink and I love the bandito burros with their fantastic guac. The reason why I gave them a 4 is because I went tonight and was a bit irritated that they told us their meat filling for their chimichangas or whatever they put the fillings in are pre-made and the cooks would not make it to order. My boyfriend hates onions to the point of not eating whatever it is if the tiniest bit of onion is found. We asked if they could make a chicken chimi without onions and not only did the waitress say no, she didn't even ask. I don't know if that's laziness on her part or if she's asked so many times already that she already knows the answer. Then she explained that the chicken was pre-made, but if we order the pollo, that's not pre-made. That was rather confusing but I think we figured out it's a chicken breast that they grill and shred for the dish instead of the mix of white and dark meat they usually use. 

I will definitely keep coming back to the cantina for their Sunday specials. They're the best around. However, if you have someone with you with food allergies, I don't know how accommodating they are for you and I think a restaurant should be able to make your food to order.
