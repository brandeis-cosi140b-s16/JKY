Debated between 3 and 4 stars for Verde.  I enjoyed it, but didn't love it.  I'll visit again hopefully soon and maybe then I'll take it up to 4 stars.  

Starting off the cocktails were the best part of the meal, the Tres Verde was fantastic and I would recommend it highly.  The appetizer we choose was the elotes since my wife wasn't eating meat.  Corn isn't in season so I'll give them a bit of a pass, but it wasn't great.  Fairly forgettable.  I got the chicken enchiladas for dinner.  The sauce on the enchiladas was pretty good and I was happy with the dish overall.  It was good, but didn't blow me away.  My wife continuing with the no meat theme, got the Tacos de Camote, which she enjoyed very much.  Finished up with the Tres Leches and again it was pretty good, but not spectacular.  

The feel of Verde I enjoyed very much.  The decor and openness I thought was a real plus.  I could easily see myself having some drinks at the bar on a regular basis.  Our server also was very good, she was a little in the weeds when we got there so we waited a little longer than we would've liked but she made up for it when she was at our table.
