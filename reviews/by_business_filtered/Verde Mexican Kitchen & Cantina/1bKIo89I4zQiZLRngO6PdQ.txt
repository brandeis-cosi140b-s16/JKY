Recently got a chance to visit Verde for Sunday Brunch.

Sat outside on their patio (which is dog friendly and the main reason we visited here).

The service staff is super friendly (to our dog too!)
The bloody marys are on point.
They have some of the best fresh chips I have had in a while.

I ordered the Chiliquilles with Chorizo (recommended for sure...if I had a hangover, this would of killed it).

Also had the granola pancakes which were super fresh and a great sweet alternative.

Others had their version of Eggs Benedict which was a major success.

Definitley coming back next time I'm in PGH.
