We stopped by on a recent Sunday for Brunch.  Our favorite table was already occupied, so we had to settle for a small table by the window.  

We started out with roasted tomatillo salsa and chips.  I really love this salsa.  It's some of the best I have ever had.  For our meals, BJ got their Mexican French toast.  He really loved the jalapeno cream cheese filling and the mango marmalade.  I got the smoked brisket with sweet potatoes, poblanos, red onion, & sweet pepper hash topped with a fried egg.  The dish is so delicious, I could eat it 5 times a week!   We have even tried to replicate it at home and have been somewhat successful.  I can't wait to visit, again.
