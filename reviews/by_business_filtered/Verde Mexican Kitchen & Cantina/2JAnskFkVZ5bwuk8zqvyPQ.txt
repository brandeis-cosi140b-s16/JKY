Big time disappointing. So hip on the outside. So little on the substance side. An increasing trend in Pittsburgh. Saving grace is the patio and probably the bar in winter. Food is mediocre and overpriced. We ordered the full dinners and they were lacking in quality, presentation and taste. Enchilada overcooked, chicken quality lacking, sauce meager and tasteless. Looks like they have a chef, but tastes like a cook -- who just started two days ago.
