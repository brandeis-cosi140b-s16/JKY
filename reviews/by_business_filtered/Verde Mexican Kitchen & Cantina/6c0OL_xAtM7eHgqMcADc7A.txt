The food was outstanding and the service was exceptional.  The food was prepared perfectly . We started with guacamole and a trio of salsas. They were all just right. My wife and I also ordered two flights of tequila to go with our apps which exemplified the difference between everyday tequilas and the unusual selection that is available here (the owners selection and the daily special).  The liquor went down very easily along with the fresh warm chips. I ordered carne asada prepared rare and it actually came out perfectly rare which is the exception not the rule around town. My wife had pollo enchiladas that were delicious.  The dessert was a wonderful Latin take on apple pie with cinnamon ice cream that alone would  bring us back.   The waiter, Kevin, was attentive but not overbearing and provided us with everything that we needed. We were able to course over selves and did not feel rushed. Verde might just be my new favorite. I am definitely going back and you should try it too.
