Verde, as a restaurant, is "green" to the neighborhood.  In some ways, they are also green to subtleties of flavors.

When going to Verde, you will be welcomed by a modern, industrial-chic decor and friendly waitstaff.  The drinks are also creative and the menu is original.

The one area that could use some improvement is the execution of the dishes.  Although ordering two different entrees, our food was topped with the same overpowering chipolte tomato sauce.  The flavors on the Enchilandas Verduras were strangely bitter and not  at all complementary.  The Empanadas Verduras, while satisfying, were made with puff pastry dough rather than a handmade variety.  

Overall, we are glad Verde exists in Garfield and we hope they do well - maybe they will after their green  has matured a little bit.
