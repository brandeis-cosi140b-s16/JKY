I live nearby Verde, but had heard mixed reviews so I had never stopped by to try it until tonight & it was pretty disappointing. First, we waited at least 45 min for our meals. Our table was only 2 people, so it's not like we had a big party. The place was steady, but not packed or anything. Then once our meals came, my boyfriend took 1 cut into his chicken & there was literally A POOL OF BLOOD in it!  Not even just pink, but lots of blood. I have no idea what took them so long to get us our food, considering they barely cooked the meat. They gave him the option of having a new plate cooked for him or to order something else different from the menu & he opted for a vegetarian dish. He got this dish quicker, but i had already finished my meal by the time they were able to get it to him. 

I thought for sure we wouldn't be charged for his meal, but nope! They took a lousy $4 off our $60 bill. Talk about poor restaurant management! I've worked in restaurants before, and almost always the customer would have gotten their meal for free in this situation.

The prices were high compared to the food portions too. You can get just as good, if not better, food at other places with not quite as small portions. (and also a lot faster too)

Even though I live nearby, and the outdoor seating is nice, I won't be back. I wanted to like this place, but the whole experience was awful.
