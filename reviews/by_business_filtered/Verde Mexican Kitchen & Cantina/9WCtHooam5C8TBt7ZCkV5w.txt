With a selection of 178 tequilas...I think I'm in love.  Definitely came out of there with a warm fuzzy feeling.

Attended the Yelp event held here this past weekend and got to sample their brand spanking new brunch menu.  I'm not a big brunch person as it is, so to me this was a hard sale.  I will say I did not get to sample all the fare presented so my review on the food will be short.  I sampled the turkey sandwich and French toast brioche.  The turkey sandwich was good, but I feel like it was missing something.  Not sure what, maybe a sauce, not a heavy sauce, but just a sauce to compliment all the yumminess between the toasty goodness.  Turkey, cheese, avocado, red onions, and probably something I'm missing.  They all complimented each other nicely, but I still believe a dab of something would have hit a home run in my book.  The French toast brioche, in one word, AMAZING!  Wasn't doused with all the sweetness I expected, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Definitely will look for that again when I return.

The venue itself is very pleasing to the eye.  With all the natural light coming in it is a very welcoming space.  With the agave presence everywhere.  From their emblem to the wood planks hanging from the ceiling.  As we all know, tequila comes from the agave.  Which brings me to my happy moment.  Tequila.  I'm not a big drinker, but I love me some tequila.  I'm sure that even if i were to visit this place on a regular basis, it would take me well over a year to sample all 178 tequilas on hand.  Hey, I'm not complaining about that.  Participating in a tequila tasting is quite fun and educational as well.  I now know the difference between tequilas.

If you've never been here before, be sure to stop in. When nicer weather allows, seating outside is encouraged.
