The owner came to bus the table beside ours and sat to have a conversation. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. So I don't want this 3/5 to be misconstrued- by all means go to this Latin flare restaurant and try each of their, approximately, one million tequilas. But prepare to pay for the experience. I could stand a bit more quality for the price. 

The atmosphere is super relaxed and funky and the food was pretty good. My only complaints are their lack of queso dip for the chips and the price. But if these aren't a turnoff for you, please try it out.
