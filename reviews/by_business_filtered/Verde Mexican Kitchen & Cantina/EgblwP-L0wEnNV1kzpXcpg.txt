I was in Pittsburgh for a business meeting.  I found this place purely by accident and I'm so happy I went there! 

Chips and salsa - "fresh" chips and great chipotle salsa (deep flavor) along with some green tomatillo sauce (nice balance).  I think the chipotle had some pineapple in there, which gave it a little sweetness, which I like and it was not too spicy.   Both salsa's were fabulous and I nearly ate all of the chips... not good, had to save room...  

I ordered an a la carte chorizo taco.  It lasted about 30 seconds.  I wanted a couple more.  Simple, with a cilantro yogurt that hit it.  

I also ordered the chicken enchiladas.  It was a symphony of flavors.  The poblano cream sauce was the bomb!  

Friendly staff (seems like everyone in Pittsburgh is friendly) and an ambiance of young and old and glass blowing across the street at Gallery Glass.  So cool.  

Next time I'm in Pittsburgh Verde will be at the top of my list.   

PS - if you're picky about Mexican food, you need to know Mexican food.  This place is a step above all Mexican restaurants I've ever been too.
