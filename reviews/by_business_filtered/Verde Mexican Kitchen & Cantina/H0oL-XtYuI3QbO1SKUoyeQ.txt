I first tried Verde years ago, when it first opened, with the old chef. I decided to give it another chance and I'm glad I did! Great space, great service, and the food was so much tastier than before. The bean dip was delicious and the margaritas are fresh and not super sweet. Had a great meal and the will definitely reconsider and add to our Mexican list!
