I ate here a little while ago with a dining companion during happy hour.  We stopped by after seeing it and thinking that it looked cool.

When we got there we both decided on the house margarita which was the happy hour special for $5.  I can't say that it was bad but I wouldn't say that it was great either.  For my entree I decided upon the enchiladas de pollo.  The star of the meal was the sauce for it which was spicy but smooth.  The rest of it was solid although nothing else stood out.

The bottom line for me Is that I will not be back in the future.  Verde did little to distinguish itself from other Mexican restaurants except to be $5-$10 more per entree.
