I really did not think I would like this place.  It seems weird and stuffy, easy to expect in the "new" section of Garfield (omg gentrification`*~).  But it's good. Real good.

I had the a la carte tacos. Two chicken tacos that were very simple--normal spicy (really spicy for me), very good.  But my real meal was the sangria blanca. Geez louise, it came in a goblet of sorts(?) with a little Pimms added; awesome and not too sweet!!  They had a lengthy cocktail list that actually contained more than tequila, but the selection also included so. many. tequilas.
My +1 had enchiladas. They were not spicy enough for him.  I thought they were good enough; I am a wimp and the poblano crema on them was safe and yummy.  The beans and rice were on par as well.  Honestly, all he cared about was his Mexican Coke.

This is a few blocks from home and while it seems like way too much, they do it well.  We went on a Saturday evening and were one of 4 other tables, not including a few at the small bar (which you can eat at and watch some sports or whatever).  This place's patio is super popular during the summer, but if you want to try this out before committing to some happy hour gatherings, you won't have trouble.
