The atmosphere at Verde is lovely - vibrant, colorful, trendy, and fun. And, that outdoor patio is fantastic. Drinks? Amaze-balls. However, the food and service left a lot of room for improvement. 

We ordered the ceviche app - disappointing. The huge chunks of shrimp were too large to pick up with the plantain chip, and the flavor missed the mark. It wasn't subtle or refreshing like ceviche should be - it was oddly heavy with these thick chunks of pickled onion, and it was overly spicy. 

We got an assortment of dishes at our table - chili rellenos, chicken enchilada, tofu enchilada, pork tacos. The only edible dish was the tacos. The rest were smothered - and I mean smothered - in too thick, too hot sauces that masked the flavor of anything underneath. Mouths on fire, we had to ask multiple times for water. (The waiter did bring us a free dessert for making us wait so long -thanks!) The standout menu item for us was the house made sour cream - it saved our dishes, and was smooth and creamy. 

Verde has so much potential, though. Great vibe, fantastic location - but, the food falls flat. It's not light or fresh enough to be Mexi-Cali, and it's not subtle or flavorful enough to be traditional Mexican. My suggestion? Come to Verde for Happy Hour and chips and salsa, and go home totally happy!
