Came here for restaurant week at Brunch time, because it is way too expensive to visit for dinner normally. I really enjoyed my food. I had the chilaquiles with seitan, and a bloody mary. Also came with a side of roasted sweet potatoes. The service was good, and we didn't have to wait since they have the sense to take reservations.

I had a good time, but as I said, while the brunch prices are totally reasonable, the rest of the menu seems overpriced. It is very vegetarian friendly, and for that I would like to be able to give it 4.5 stars if I could.
