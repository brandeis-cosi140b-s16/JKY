The tequila menu is extensive and the servers are able to talk about the options and make informed recommendations. I ordered the tofu enchiladas--I am not a vegetarian--and it tasted like a composed dish rather than "something for the vegetarians". It was spicy and full of flavor. If you are looking for all you can eat nachos and burritos with refried beans, this isn't the place for you. I will definitely be back.
