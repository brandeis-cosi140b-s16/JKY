Tacos are the bread and butter of a mexican joint - how do you mess that up? This rating is for the food and service, not the drinks. I went on a Wednesday night, and the service was friendly, but pretty slow. So if you're looking to grab a quick bite, I wouldn't advise stopping by here.

Their veggie-friendly choice, the Tacos De Camote is blasphemous to the taco gods. The presentation is nice, but you can't judge a book by its cover. The taco shell is a cold flour tortilla, filled with soggy sweet potato chunks, chickpeas, and covered by a bed of iceberg lettuce. Lastly, it is topped with some weird ranch, thousand island-ish dressing that was just not good. There is no saving the Tacos De Camote, they just need to scrap it and come up with a new option. 

The chips are meh as well. If I were to go back, it would most likely be for a tequila flight or a margarita during happy hour with multiple orders of the Elotes (grilled corn with lime aioli and sea salt) which were phenomenal.
