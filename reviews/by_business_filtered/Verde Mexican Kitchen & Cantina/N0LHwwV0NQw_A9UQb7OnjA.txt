First off, the ambiance of the restaurant was extremely comforting and inviting.  It was definitely not what I expected in that location. (I believe that the location was previously an Eat-N-Park restaurant, so this place is definitely an upgrade!)  I was really impressed with the decor.
However, that being said, I thought that for the price of the food and the surroundings, my overall impression of the restaurant was just okay.
Here's my assessment of the food:
Salsas - Decent (For a dollar, you couldn't complain.  However, these are usually free in most restaurants.)

Antojitos -
* Wings - Okay (Barely seasoned)
* Queso Stuffed Pepper - Fire breathing, sweat inducing, tongue blazing hot and not much else!
* Puffed Hominy - Tasty
* Chicharones - Meh! (Had them in Miami at El Palacio De Los Jugos and there is absolutely, positively NO COMPARISON!  Like comparing a Ford Pinto to a Rolls Royce!  The chefs at Verde need to take a trip southward!)

Pollo Tacos - Barely any flavor and for almost $5 per taco, I can whip up better in my kitchen and have sides.
Overall, the rug didn't match the curtains, in my opinion!
