This place was good....food was delicious, margaritas were great....both were much better than our other favorite local Mexican stomping ground. Only problem with this place is how pricey it is....$9 for a bowl of guacamole? Too much....the entree prices are also a little steep, delicious food, but on the higher end of what would make me turn this place into a regular stop. The tequila selection is unbeatable and the margs are fantastic. Overall....it's a great place. Just wish it wasn't priced so high.
