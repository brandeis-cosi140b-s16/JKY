We got there with a party of 6 about 15 minutes before official closing time. Were politely greeted and sat. Our waiter was cool, but wanted to get out of there. Chips were legit. Salsa was legit. There is some tequila special so we took advantage of that. A pitcher of margarita was $26. I don't know what was up with that. Everything was cool except I got shorted the coins from the change on my bill. I don't know what was up with that either.  I like that there is a tequila bar in Pittsburgh. Open later would be nice.  I'm not sure how to feel about my change.
