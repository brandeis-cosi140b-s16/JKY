I haven't been to Verde since it's inception. I visited Verde about 2 months after it opened and had a margarita, during happy hour which was wonderful. The appetizers we had were outstanding....but it did seem somewhat bright at the bar, lighting wise. Overall though a great place to walk to for happy hour.
