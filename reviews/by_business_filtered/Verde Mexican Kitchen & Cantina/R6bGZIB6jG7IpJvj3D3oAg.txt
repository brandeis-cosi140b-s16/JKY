I love this place!

I have been here several times and each time the food and service were exceptional! 

I love the decor and the lighting in the bar area is cool as well. It really takes you out of Garfield and takes you on an island getaway for the time while you are there.

The first time I went was during Happy Hour so I had to try the delicious Lomo Tacos (Grass-fed ground beef, jalape√±o feta crema, red onion and cilantro) The soft tacos were perfectly fluffy and the steak was very flavorful. The chips and salsa are a hit as well.

The next time I went I had the Carne Asada (7oz grass fed sirloin steak, agave nectar glaze, guajillo-squash puree, roasted vegetables, salsa macha and avocado) The steak was tender and juicy and cooked to perfection. 

Another great thing about Verde is that they offer a lot of Gluten Free dining options for those looking for that option as well.

The true reason to go here is the tequila selection. I doubt you will find a better margarita anywhere else in the city of Pittsburgh or surrounding area for that matter.

All in all I love the food and drinks here and don't mind paying for them but, the prices might be a bit too high for the residents in the area. I would also recommend you make reservations as at times it can be hard to score a table.
