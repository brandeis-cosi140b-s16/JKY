Went on a Friday night, took about 20 mins to be seated, server was polite but not nearly as attentive as one should be in a restaurant. After a long wait for our food, she did ask if everything was okay but after that, she walked past us at least 5 or 6 times, never asking about refilling our drinks.  What prompted me to publicly write this negative review was that the hostess came to us, told us they booked a party for 11 people and needed us to move!! Upon speaking with the manager who apparently doesn't understand his role in addressing issues that come up, we were able to remain in our seats.  About 10 minutes later, another server came to ask if we needed refills but at that point I was just ready to leave.  Our original server never came back, we weren't offered dessert.  Can't say that I'd go back or even recommend it to anyone.  Quite the disappointment!
