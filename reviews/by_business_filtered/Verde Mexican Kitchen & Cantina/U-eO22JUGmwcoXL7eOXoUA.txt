I came to Verde for dinner when in town visiting some friends. It was so good! We were there before 7 so the happy hour special on margaritas were still going on, which we took full advantage of. I had a frozen margarita and it was huge and so very tasty!

We all decided to order our own tacos for dinner, although the family sharing options were very intriguing as well, especially because they come with sides. I had one fish, one chorizo, and one beef taco. They were all so good. I definitely them all. The fish was tasty and very fresh, the beef was so flavorful (although a big hard to eat as it got so greasy) and the chorizo was perfectly spicy. If I could go back, I might get some sides to go with it, but overall it was delicious.

Also the chips and salsa - a necessity at any good mexican. A++!!
