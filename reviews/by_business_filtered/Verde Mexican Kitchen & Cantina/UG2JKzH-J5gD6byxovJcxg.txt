Verde lives up to the buzz!  

I've been there twice now in the past two weeks - once for a private pre-opening event and again last night for a work-dinner function.  While both visits were  during Verde's 'soft launch,' I thought it was excellent!  The food was very tasty, the staff was very nice, and the ambiance was alive! 

The chicken tacos had great flavor and I heard similar comments from my colleagues who tried the sweet potato tacos.  I would HIGHLY recommend Chef LBEE's signature corn shrimp fritters for the appetizer and the tres leche bread pudding for dessert - simply mouth watering!

Jeff Catalina, the owner, also gave us a personal 'tour' of their tequila selection - very impressive, to say the least!  Having been to Tequila, Mexico and toured the Jose Cuervo factory, my eyes were immediately drawn to the top shelf and the unopened bottle La Reserva de Familia (The Family Reserve).  This is an outstanding sipping tequila with strong body and a smokey finish.  I would recommend as a great after-dinner drink.  

I have been looking for a place that stocks this tequila - glad that Verde has included it in their regular stock - I'll be returning just for this, for sure!

Here's a little fun fact for you ... when you are sitting down near the bar, have a look up at the ceiling.  What appears to be a hodgepodge of dangling and angled finished wooden boards, are actually a collage of the leaves making up an agave plant.  It stretches from the corner of the restaurant and fans out into the dining room area!  Nice touch!

Overall, I would highly recommend Verde to anyone looking for a new spin on Mexican in the burgh.  Best of luck to Jeff, LBEE, and all the Verde staff as they begin their journey to Pittsburgh restaurant fame!
