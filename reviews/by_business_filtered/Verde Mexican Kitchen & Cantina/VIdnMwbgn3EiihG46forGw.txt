It was insanely busy for a Wednesday ($3 Tequila Tastings Night) night. I didn't feel like sitting at a table so I sat at the bar and ordered a drink or two (Granada Sangira & Winterberry Margarita LURVED IT) and looked through the menu. There isn't a lot of options for food but everything that came out looked amazing from what I could see. I asked the bartenders, who by the way are extremely friendly and helpful, what the soup of the day was. Lobster Saffron Bisque. I decided what the hell let's go for it. Out in came in this huge ass bowl. It was definitely a lot larger than what I expected good enough for two people to split. It was good but I don't think I could finish an entire bowl of it. I took it home. Next on the menu that I order was the Yucca fries. Nothing special I couldn't survived without it. Last but not least the flour-less chocolate cake. Dear god (or whomever resides up above), thank you for chocolate and thank you for that delicious cake. All in all my experience was good. Definately going back again with a group of friends!
