Checked this place out the other night and left pretty disappointed. 

We had no problems getting seated (I will say that we got there right at 5 with no reservations - the place seemed pretty full once we left though). I liked the set-up of Verde - low lighting, trendy bar, spacious yet intimate feel. I'd give five stars for the atmosphere. 

The chips and salsa were delicious, but unfortunately you only get one basket on the house. I tried a house margarita on the rocks and a sangria and left completely sober. I could have easily been the DD that night (and I don't have a high tolerance for alcohol!). The entrees looked delicious, and although you could definitely taste their freshness, the dishes were actually pretty bland.  The food and drinks left something to be desired!

My biggest qualm was in the service. I actually had to get up and go to the bar to order my second drink because our server never came by once our entrees arrived. We had to ask a different person to get a refill on water and we were never asked how our food was until they were clearing our table. We had a different server towards the end of our meal with no explanation of what was going on. I've waited tables before and a quick "How's everything going?" and a simple explanation on the server change was all that was needed to make the experience more pleasant. 

Unfortunately, $4 refills on chips and salsa, weak drinks, bland food, and poor service are not gong to get me back here anytime soon.
