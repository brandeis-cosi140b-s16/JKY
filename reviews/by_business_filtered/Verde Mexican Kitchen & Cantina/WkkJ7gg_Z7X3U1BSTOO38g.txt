The food is a joke.  I worked as a chef in Arizona and worked in Mexican restaurants there.  This place is not representative.  The black beans are canned and rinsed and have little seasoning.  They put "simple syrup" in their chipotle salsa along with agave syrup.  I asked because I could tell.  "Simple syrup" is just sugar and water.  The sugars completely dominate the flavor of the salsa, and of course we were told "everyone loves it."  Nope.  Not everyone!   In Tucson or Austin that would be thrown against the wall.  The pork and pulled chicken are definitely slow-cooked and tender which is good, but not seasoned well at all.   Also, they do not fold the burritos correctly so you end up with ends that are almost entirely flour tortilla with no filling.  The tortillas are clearly not made fresh or on-site and have dough conditioners in them like you would buy mass-marketed at a supermarket.  I'm guessing that the diced tomato they use for their pico de gallo comes from a bag pre-diced by their food supplier.  The texture indicates this.  The chips were okay.  They were deep fried corn tortillas but that's nothing new.  You also have to pay for them which does not happen in places where Mexican food is a restaurant staple.  

No one in Pittsburgh is doing Mexican food right, but I keep looking.  

Overall, Verde has a nice looking space, and the service is okay (at least the day we went), but the food is comical considering it calls itself "Mexican."  It is not representative and this place would do well to send its cooking staff on a trip through Mexico.
