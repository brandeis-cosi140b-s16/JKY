Solidly meh.  The service got a lot better over the last two years, but the food isn't worth the price they're charging for it.    $37 last weekend got us out of brunch with three solidly meh tacos, a breakfast burrito, and a single iced tea (including tax and tip, but still, almost forty bucks!)

The tacos were pretty bland, and for that price, they should have *sang*.  The burrito was incredibly bland; cumin, chili powder, cilantro, anything would helped it along.  It felt like bad hippie food.

That all said, the drinks at the bar are great, and I'd strongly recommend them.  I just wouldn't go here if food was the primary draw, much the same way I wouldn't recommend the Sharp Edge for its food, at all.

At this point, I wish something else had went into this spot.
