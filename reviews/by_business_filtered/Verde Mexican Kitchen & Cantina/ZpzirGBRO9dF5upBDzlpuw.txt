I have been twice since the opening and have enjoyed both dinners. The  ambiance is fun and lively and the bar area is sure to be a hit. 

The margaritas are  authentic and they are not afraid to make them with a nice kick. I also enjoyed a Negro Modelo on tap which is a treat for anyone who has been limited to bottles in Pittsburgh. 

For appetizers my son, daughter and i shared the roasted corn which is killer and the chicken tortas which I would highly recommend. For the main course the chile rellanos stuffed with roasted corn, black beans and rice are amazing. If I could have licked the plate I would have!  My son had the chicken tacos which were also good and my daughter enjoyed the carne asada which was cooked to a perfect medium rare exactly as she ordered.  We topped the evening off by sharing a bread pudding which has a delicious icing. 

We enjoyed our dining experience and will undoubtedly be frequent visitors.  This place is sure to be a hit and I cannot wait for nice weather to enjoy the outdoor seating.
