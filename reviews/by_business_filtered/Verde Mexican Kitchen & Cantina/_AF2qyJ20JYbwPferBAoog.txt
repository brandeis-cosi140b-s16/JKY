Such such such good drinks, that's what you need to know.

So it went like this, we're there, huge group, 12 of us.  Half of the table gets there early and orders a pitcher of Sangria, the other half, a bit tardy (well, a bit not 30 minutes early) order the Margarita.  The Marg people are thinking: "What are those Sangria people doing, the Margs are SO GOOD." Me, being one of the Marg people, need to get to the bottom of this.  Turns out, the Sangria people are thinking "What are those Marg people doing, the Sangria is SO GOOD."  And guess what, they're both right.

When you go, bring patience, they're still sorting out the service bit, plan to get a tequila, the carne asada and a sol beer.  To decide between the sangria or the marg, well... you're on your own.
