The vibe is really great and the food is awesome.  Verde seems to have changed some things with their menu and it's made eating there a lot more affordable and attractive.  Sat at the bar tonight with 4 friends and Rachel was awesome.  We weren't able to sit at a table without a reservation but she was super accommodating and made sure we had a great time.  If you get the chance,  have some tacos at the bar and chat with their awesome staff.
