Verde, I love you. Really, I do. I wish that the service wasn't so hit or miss, but I never leave feeling in any way unsatisfied.

My favorite margarita, like, ever wasn't on their menu anymore when we last visited, but they still did their best to replicate it for me, which I so appreciated. It's those little moments when staff go above and beyond that make a difference.

Most recently, we split the family-style tacos, choosing shrimp and seitan chorizo (!!!) as our proteins. So. Effing. Good. It was also priced rather low, considering we both left feeling totally stuffed and paid, what, maybe $30?

Verde only loses one star because I've had some terrible service, here. I've never had a server be anything but nice... But there's this vanishing act that it seems a lot of them have perfected. Even when it's not that busy, I've routinely had my server disappear from order taking through almost completion of my entree before I am checked on at all. However, our server this past time was more attentive. 

Te amo, Verde!
