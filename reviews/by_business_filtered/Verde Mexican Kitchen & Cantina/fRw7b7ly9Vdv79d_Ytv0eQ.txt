Verde was a mixed bag for me. I looooove Mexican food and while Verde is a higher scale Mexican restaurant, I'm not sure the quality of food is worth the higher price.  Give me El Campesino, Mexico City or Patrons any day of the week over this for tasty, traditional Mexican.  

The restaurant has a modern feel and has a great outside patio.  Luckily, because we went at 8:45 we didn't have a wait.  I tried the red Sangria which was excellent and then we tried the Infusions tequila flight.  They have an amazing selection of tequila so even though tequila and I are not good friends, I gave it a shot.  My favorite was the Agave Loco which was infused with jalapeno peppers.  Surprisingly good and you know it's good when even a tequila hater likes it.

The green tomatillo salsa they brought out was also very tasty and had just the right amount of spice.  For our late dinner, we split an black bean and corn empanadas appetizer and the chicken enchilada dinner which was served with beans and rice.  The empanadas were excellent and they gave you two huge empanadas.  Even though we split the appetizer, between the one empanada and the salsa and chips, i was stuffed.  Then, out came the chicken enchiladas which had waaaaaaaay too much salt in them.  Other than that, they would have been quite tasty but the salt was just too much.  The flavors were bold, the vegetables were fresh and the service was attentive.  

So I guess the big question is with all the positives, why only 3 stars?  I think it goes back to the fact that while everything was good, it just wasn't out of this world.  For the price, I'm just as happy going to one of the other cheaper Mexican restaurants and will have just as an enjoyable meal.
