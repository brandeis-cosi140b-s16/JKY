Great margaritas!  The flautas and tacos were tasty too.  The wine list is ok, but way overpriced for cheap wine.  I feel like the restaurant is trying too hard to be trendy/upscale at the same time, but the food really needs to be more creative for what they are charging.   The dinners were more like tapas so if you want a meal, prepare to order multiple things on the menu.  It has a lot of potential and I would definitely go back for drinks.
