Cute place. But the food was strange tasting and the portions were insanely small. $17 for the vegetarian enchiladas is insanely expensive, considering it was half the size of a normal dinner plate and the food covered about half of the plate. And did not come with a side of rice or beans. Strange taste to the salsa. Almost a sweet rotted taste. I wanted to love this place because I live so close. But I won't be back unfortunately.
