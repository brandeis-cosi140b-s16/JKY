I was here after a Yelp event, so I was lucky to get a seat at the bar early and I didn't give it up until I left much later when the restaurant was getting packed.  I love the chips and pico, both are fresh and tasty.  The chips have that flaked sea salt that's just heaven when it melts on to a freshly-fried chip.  The pico de gallo is heavenly - zingy from fresh lime, mellow from tomatoes, a little spicy from onions, and tangy from cilantro.

I also had a pollo taco on a soft flour tortilla.  The flavors were great and you can tell all of the ingredients walked in the door that morning.  I would have liked a bigger portion, though with each taco coming in at $5, you can tell you're supposed to try a few to make a meal out of it.

The bartenders were on their game when the event started, and while they were still friendly, it was hard to catch them after the event when the restaurant had filled.  I don't blame them at all, it would just have been nice to get a little acknowledgement as they passed that they'd be with me next/soon, though.

I had a jalapena cocktail and it was the most expensive thing I ordered.  You're paying for quality; it was spicy and sweet and very delicious.  A fellow Yelper turned me on to this cocktail- it isn't on the menu yet, but it will be back on soon.  In the meantime, order it from Rachel, she said!

Pros: If you have an appreciation and love for tequila, this is your place.  I'm not at that point yet, and if it were closer to my house, I would probably get to that point quickly!  It is a little pricey, but it's quality.
Cons: price, small parking lot (though kudos for having one), spotty service when busy.
