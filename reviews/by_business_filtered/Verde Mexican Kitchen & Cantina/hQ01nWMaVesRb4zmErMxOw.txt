As an LA transplant in Pittsburgh, whatever Verde serves, it certainly is not Mexican food. After a disastrous outing that resulted in returned food, I went back one other time for drinks, as the margaritas actually are quite good.

While my girlfriend and I showed up with the place about half empty, we were comically told that there was an hour long wait to be seated, as allegedly a quarter of Pittsburgh was just minutes away from showing up for their reservations all at the same time.

Verde is dead to me, perhaps it ought to be for you as well.
