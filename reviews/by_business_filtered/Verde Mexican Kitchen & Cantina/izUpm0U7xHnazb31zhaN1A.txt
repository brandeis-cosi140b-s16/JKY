This is the second time I've eaten here, and the quality of the service was pretty low both times. The first time, I gave them the benefit of the doubt because it was packed (it was after a first friday event), and our waiter was preoccupied with a really annoying picky woman at the table next to us who kept demanding things. He was, shall I say, innattentive. Whatever, the food was really good, and despite cold drafts from the door, we had a pretty good time (although we would have ordered more drinks if we could have gottent the waiters attention). This last time was on Valentines day. I made a reservation and specifically asked to have a table away from the door. The guy taking my reservation confirmed that request, but when we showed up, the hostess put us RIGHT BY THE DOOR, even though there were several open tables. So I had to ask her to move us to one of those, which she begrudgingly did. The server we had was equally inattentive, even though the place wasn't particularly busy (even though it was Valentines day). We lacked some silver ware, and though we asked him for some, he never brought it. I had to go steal some fro one of the empty tables. The food was still really great, though, but I don't think I'll be heading back here...
