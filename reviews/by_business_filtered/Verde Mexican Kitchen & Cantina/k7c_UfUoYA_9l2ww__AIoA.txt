Very nice decor. Sweet potato tacos were delicious although I would have preferred they be on a corn tortilla rather than flour. Thought the beans and chips were too salty. Portion size a little small but that is better than too big. Giving this place 4 stars because of the nice decor/ atmosphere and because I enjoyed the tacos. Not what I consider authentic but I enjoyed my dinner here.
