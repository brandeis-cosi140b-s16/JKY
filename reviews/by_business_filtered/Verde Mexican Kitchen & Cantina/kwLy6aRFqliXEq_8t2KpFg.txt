Ok, so I'm always seeking great authentic Mexican! I figured that this place would be amongst the best. To me it was eh! Starters we ordered guacamole which was decent, but needed a kick to it maybe more salt or lime... Ordered a pitcher of sangria, not what I was expecting, seemed like they took a bottle of merlot emptied it in to ice and a put a couple pieces of oranges in there.. Na uh! Not what I'm used to... Finally entree orders we carne asaeda and brisket of beef tamale... I order the steak well done ... And came out medium... The steak was very tough
To chew and was CHEWY.. I hate that! As for the brisket that my company had, that was pretty good .. They def give a good presentation and ambiance is nice .
