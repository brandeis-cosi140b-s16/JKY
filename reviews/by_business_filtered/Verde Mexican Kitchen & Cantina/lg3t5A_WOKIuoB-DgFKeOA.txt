Finally got a table the other day. NOTHING HAS ANY SALT IN IT! I've seen other reviewers have the same complaint. There was literally no detectable salt in the salsa  (tomatillo or chipotle), or the tacos or chile rellenos. I think this might actually be a problem in sensory perception by either the chef/management or both? I never put salt on food at the table, especially in restaurants, but everything we had was flat and vegetal tasting. You're better off for flavor going to Mad Mex as much as I hate to admit it. Shoot, maybe even Taco Bell.
