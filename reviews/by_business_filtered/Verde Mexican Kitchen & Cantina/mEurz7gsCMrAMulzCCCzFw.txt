Verde has the best Mezcal list I have ever seen. But be willing to pay top dollar for such variety and rarities. If you come here be ready to drink, because that is where this place really shines.

The food on the other hand isn't so amazing. By no means is it poor, but after eating entrees here five times I have always left feeling underwhelmed. Is it because the price/quality ratio is skewed slightly in the direction of $ signs? Maybe. Is it because there is always just something a little off (i.e. chicken overcooked)? Perhaps.

Now the decor is modern and hip, but what could really set this place off is if the waitstaff could just step it up a tiny bit to match the vibe. They are always adequate, but when entrees are between 25 and 30 dollars I do expect the staff to go the extra mile. Often, the servers don't know the daily specials, what beer they have on tap, or can't answer questions about the stellar Tequila and Mezcal list. Don't get me wrong, everyone is always extremely friendly, but a more knowledgeable staff could really set Verde apart.
