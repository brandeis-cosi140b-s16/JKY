I stopped for a cocktail after work because of a newspaper article I read featuring top-notch female bartenders from around the area. I have to say if you are a serious cocktail drinker then this place is for you!

Verde features 175+ 100% agave tequilas and mezcals. I ordered a mezcal flight which featured three have portions of mezcal and also a mexican aperitif to finish it off. The tequila list can be overwhelming so this is a great way to branch out and try a few tequilas at a time without breaking your bank.

After my flight I capped the night off with a house margarita. I'm very picky when I order margaritas, because the drink has become bastardized over the years into some sort of gaudy, extra-sweet, fruity concoction put into a ridiculous glass.  If you are a cocktail purist like me, you will be satisfied with the margaritas here. Mine was served in an old-fashioned glass and tasted very much like the classic tequila/Cointreau/fresh-lime ratio I make for myself.


Verde had everything I wanted: fresh fruit behind the bar, exceptional service, and a serious cocktail menu. I will be coming back for sure.
