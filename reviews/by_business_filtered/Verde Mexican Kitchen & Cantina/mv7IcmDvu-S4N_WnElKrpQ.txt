Came in at 8 on a Friday night with a big party to celebrate a friends birthday. I came in a few minutes early with a friend so we sat at the bar and had a drink while we waited for our party to arrive. The bar was pretty crowded while it looked like a lot of open tables. They also had the big back table all ready for us. I got a Caipirinha and she ordered the Forbidden root margarita. Both bartenders were nice and offered us chips and salsa. After the second offer we figured sure why not and were pleased to see a tangy tomatillo salsa that went with the chips. Once some of our party got there we closed our tab and went and sat down. More chips, more yummy salsa and another Caipirinha later we were deciding what we wanted. I believe our servers name was Joe, and he did a great job working with our large party. He made sure the drinks were full and talked to the group in half so he didn't have to keep screaming for everyone to hear him. Some of the specials sounded great that night, I wish that they printed a daily specials menu because there were so many specials I lost track of what was what as he was saying them. I went with the chicken tacos and took a bite of the fish tacos my friend ordered. Both were great! I really liked how flavorful the chicken tacos were, not dried out at all. The fish tacos were some of the best I've had around here. I usually don't order them out because I'm particular about them and tend to be underwhelmed. But, I wouldn't hesitate to order them next time I come. Great job Verde, I can't wait to come back.
