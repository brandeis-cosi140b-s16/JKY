The food is quite tasty, but the prices are high, for Mexican food.
I liked the chiles rellenos quite a bit - nice sauce and good spice.  I tried the huarache which was similar to a pizza but on a crunchy corn dough I think.  It was good but not my favorite.

The desserts are very good, but too large.  My friends ordered the bread pudding dessert, which was very tasty and memorable, but it was filling for two and enough food for three.  They should shrink the dessert portion sizes.

Service was good (on a Sunday evening) but a little uncoordinated - two different waiters came and asked us for our dessert order.  The music (old blues songs) was nice.
