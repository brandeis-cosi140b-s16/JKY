My yelping has been sparse since I started grad school, but I need to get back on the wagon and write a review of Verde--because it was that awesome.

I will start by saying that I didn't give 5 stars because I wasn't a huge fan of the entree my husband and I shared--enchiladas de verduras--because it wasn't very hot (temperature, not spicy hot) and wasn't anything special.

However, everything else was amazing.  Drinks, table side guacamole, the best tortilla chips I have EVER eaten...we will definitely be back, but probably just for happy hour.

Since we went on "Agave Wednesday," half pours of all tequila shots (that are normally priced less than $18 per shot) were just $3.  They have an interactive iPad tequila menu that describes each liquor in detail, so even tequila virgins like us had fun choosing.  $5 margs were probably the best I've had in the 'burgh, no offense to that other margarita palace that I so enjoy. :)

I would definitely recommend it if you're in the neighborhood...but don't make a special trip if you're really hungry.  Come ready to get your drink on!
