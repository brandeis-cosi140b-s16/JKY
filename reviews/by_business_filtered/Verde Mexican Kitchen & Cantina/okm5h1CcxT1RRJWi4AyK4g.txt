I'm always in search of a great place to grab some Mexican food, which brought me to Verde last Friday.  The ambiance and physical environment of the restaurant is outstanding: nice open, airy, with an outdoor patio overlooking the street.  Very chill, very nice.  Likewise, the service was on-point.  

The menu is quite interesting seeing as the drink menu simply dwarfs the food selection.  Now, this isn't necessarily a bad thing if you're a tequilla connoisseur.  The actual food menu was pretty nice though.  Plenty of vegetarian options, as well as the typical tex-mex dishes though with some new-age flair.  For instance, I ordered the chile rellenos.  Instead of the typical fried heap of cheese and grease, which I personally enjoy despite impending coronary artery disease, the rellenos at Verde are grilled.  My meal tasted good, but lacked the greatness that is real authentic diabetogenic Mexican food.  It's a personal thing, I guess.  You might actually like it!  

Nevertheless, a couple minor complaints.  The chips were too salty and I think the food was tad bit overpriced for what you get.  Parking situation could be better, but I can't really fault the restaurant on that.  Just be patient when you get there.  Overall, I'll probably come back, though I'm more likely to hit up another spot (Round Corner Cantina), when I'm feeling Mexican.
