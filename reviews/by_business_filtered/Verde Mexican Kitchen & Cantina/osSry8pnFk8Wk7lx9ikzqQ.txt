Oh, Verde! You had me at first bite!

My meal started out with a palate cleanser - a shot glass filled with a concoction of pomegranate, lime, and other juices, topped with a strong kick of pepper. Chips and a fresh green salsa were provided on the house, while I ordered the Elotes as an appetizer. The Elotes, albeit a simple snack, was far and above the highlight of the meal. Grilled corn on the cob drizzled in lime aioli and a smattering of spices and cheese = ABSOLUTE HEAVEN. Who would've known to combine all these ingredients?! (Not me - but then again, maybe that's why I don't run a restaurant, eh?)

I moved on to the main course - Enchiladas de Verduras (the vegetarian enchiladas). Incredibly fresh ingredients and cooked to perfection, though not the most novel combination here. I don't even LIKE swiss chard, but it tasted fantastic in this context. I admit, the Tacos de Camote sounded a bit more exciting, but I guess I'll just have to save that one for next time. Mad props for all the veggie-friendly stuff on the menu!

I ended my night with the Tres Leches Bread Pudding, which was just melt-in-the-mouth delicious. Again, not a fan of raisins, but I ate them all here! (Sure, it might've helped that they were drowning in sugar/butter/cream...) It was served piping hot and heavily steeped in the traditional tres leches glaze, topped with a dollop of rapidly-melting whipped cream. Definitely give this a try if (by "if", I mean "when") you stop in!

Service was exceptional. My glass was never half-empty (coming from a pessimist) and dishes were removed immediately upon finishing the food atop them.

Next time, I'll prepare to come hungry *and* thirsty, so I can give their infamous tequila collection a good run!
