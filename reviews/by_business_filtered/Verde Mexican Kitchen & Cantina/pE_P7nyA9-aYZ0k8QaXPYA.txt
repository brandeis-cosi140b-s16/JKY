I don't understand why this place isn't packed all the time.  The food is really fantastic - fresh and innovative.  For Mexican - it's light and pretty healthy.  I had the chiles relenos this evening - two rather large roasted poblanos stuffed with mushrooms and rice, with a scrumptious red sauce, surrounded by perfectly roasted winter vegetables.  My dining companions had the chicken and potatoes tacos.  All were presented beautifully with unusual and flavorful sides.  We took it easy on the appetizers - just chips, salsa and guacamole - and stuck with the house margaritas which are pretty much better than anything else you'll get in Pittsburgh - no artificial mixers - just lime juice, orange liqueur and tequlia.

The bar has a nice vibe with friendly and knowledgeable bartenders.  Verde easily serves the best Mexican food you'll get in Pittsburgh - get out and try it!
