We had a reservation for 8pm. It was a Saturday night so we knew a reservation was a must and made it days in advance. Some of our party arrived at 7:45pm and the rest at 7:50 and 8:00pm. We did not get seated until after 10pm!!!! I'm sorry but that's a bit ridiculous. Someone there either doesn't know how to count tables or take reservations. What's the point of having a reservation if you don't get seated until 2 hours later? 

The drinks were pretty good but expensive. I had a Mojito and Caipirinha. Both were about $10-$11 per drink but I think they were tasty, so whatever. So we FINALLY get our table and it's almost another hour when we finally get our food. I believe in enjoying dinner and making the most of it but arriving at 7:45pm and not leaving until after 11pm is a bit much!!! The food was not worth the price. I had chicken enchiladas that were $18. They were 2 of the smallest and blandest enchiladas that I've ever had. The very small side of beans and rice were also bland. I was not happy about the food at all especially with the long wait and high price. 

I don't think I'll be back to visit. It may be new and it may be hip and trendy but it's not worth it to me. I think Mad Mex is way better than Verde. Let me also mention that the chips and salsa are not free!! The chips and salsa verde are around $5.00 (no free refill on chips). The guacamole that was also bland is $10.00 with no free refill on chips. Save your time and your money. Eat somewhere else!!!
