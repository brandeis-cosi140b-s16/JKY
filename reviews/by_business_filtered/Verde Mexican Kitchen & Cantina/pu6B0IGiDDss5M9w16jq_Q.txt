I just wanted to update again because it's been a while and I have to say I have always had a good experience here. I know the reviews seem to vary, probably mainly with the endless debate of "is this authentic" Mexican. But really all I know is that it was delicious food.

I love the family style tacos they're offering right now. That means you order your meat and then it comes with all the fixin's to share with your dining partner. We ordered the carne asada and fish tacos. The carne asada was bomb! So flavorful! I thought the fish was good, but could have used a little more seasoning. 

I love their cocktails too. It's rare you can get a well made tequila cocktail without it being a sugary sweet mix of something as horrifying as Dailey's mix. But we watched as they squeezed the limes themselves!

I'd like to come more often for the tequila flights, I've gotta "study" my tequila:)
