I think the fact that I was hungry when I ate here got it an extra star.

Shout out to my brunch club for exposing me to restaurants around Pittsburgh!  But in the future, we can probably pass on returning here.

We went on a Sunday early afternoon for brunch.  The server was really attentive- maybe because there were on 5 other tables there...  I love the space; very clean, fun looking atmosphere.  I wanted everything on the menu but decided on the hash.  Everyone looked at their plate when the food arrived and said, "where are we going to eat after this?"  Small plates and average food for the price, unfortunately.
