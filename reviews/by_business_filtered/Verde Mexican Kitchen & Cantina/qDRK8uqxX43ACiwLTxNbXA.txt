Wow! I have been driving past this restaurant since it opened.  So good!  The food is delicious!  We had the guacamole, Yuca Fries, and split an order of the Chicken Enchiladas...alll yummy!  I saw that other review said that the sides of beans and rice were bland. I didn't experience this, they were both delicious. 
Service is on the slow side, but it wasn't ridiculous.

Will definitely be trying this place again!
