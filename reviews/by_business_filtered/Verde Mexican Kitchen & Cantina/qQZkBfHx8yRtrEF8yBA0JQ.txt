Verde has a contemporary, fun atmosphere and is one of my favorite places to go for drinks.  The bar tenders are knowledgeable and friendly.  The drinks are truly superb, and they won't hesitate to try to make something special for you to suit your tastes.  They have over 200 types of tequila (the most in the entire state of PA), and can tell you all about them!  The flights offer a chance to sample the different kinds.  The only bad thing I have to say is that I am not a fan of the food.  I love traditional authentic Mexican food, and Verde seems to offer a contemporary American version of Mexican food.  But for drinks and a fun atmosphere, you can't beat this place!  Some of the negative reviews I saw on Google, I believe, come from folks who are looking for more of a family style restaurant.  This is definitely more of a fun atmosphere geared towards a younger crowd who is there to sit and have a good time as opposed to eating and running.
