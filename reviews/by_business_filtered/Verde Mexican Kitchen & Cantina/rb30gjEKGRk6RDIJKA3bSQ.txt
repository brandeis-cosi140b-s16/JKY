I have passed by this place hundreds of times and just got around to trying it. I got the fish, pork and chicken taco with a mojito. The fish was a nice as a bit spicy but not hot taco with a great cabbage slaw on top. The pork was the best with a tender roasted pork and sweet pineapple. The chicken was good with a nice mix of seasoning and spices. It reminded me of a taco recipe from Gordon Ramsay. I also got the rice and black beans and a starter of guacamole. The guacamole was fresh but has no mic flavor past just the avocados and the black beans and rice was ok. All in all worth a try. It's tacos and drinks are good. The service is also great and the out door seating area is great when the weather is nice. Enjoy a drink and a taco in the sun. I would go back.
