I went with a group last night and we had a great meal. I'd been looking forward to trying this place since meeting the owner last year when his house was on the South Side House Tour and he said he was about to open a new restaurant that would feature authentic Mexican food. I wasn't disappointed. This isn't your typical smothered-in-cheese-and-jarred-salsa place.

The complimentary chips and tomatillo salsa are delicious. We got a guacamole appetizer for the table. It's a generously-sized portion that is incredibly fresh with lots of chunky avocado. For entrees, I shared the chick pea & camote tacos and grilled chicken tacos with a friend. I found the camote ones a bit dry, but the chicken ones were very juicy and tasty, and most importantly, the chicken tasted like it had actually been cooked on a grill as opposed to just having been branded with a grill marks iron. I tasted a friend's chiles rellenos and thought it was very good too. 

They have a choice of 3 desserts, and between us we tried all of them. They are all good, and each one meets a different need: the sorbet is light and refreshing, the tres leches bread pudding is warm and comfy, and the flourless chocolate cake is rich, dense and truffle-like.

While everything was good, I might rate the appetizers and desserts a bit higher than the entrees. Next time I might make a meal of all the salsa varieties and guac and then dessert. Or I might try the carne asada, as another reviewer here made that sound very tempting. Either way, I'm looking forward to going back.
