I've had a Verde review in my drafts for two months, and it's constantly changing.  I've had a couple spectacular meals with very meh service, and disappointing meals with spectacular service.  Never can seem to get it quite right.  

A recent brunch experience sums up my thoughts:  On a quiet Sunday morning (4 tables filled?) they lost our order for an hour and ended up comping it.  The dish that came out was a bit different than the menu, but was possibly the best brunch dish I've ever had.  I came back a few weeks later and ordered the same dish, only to have it be half the size, luke-warm, and missing several ingredients I'd loved the first time.

If they put the same creativity and portion size we got when they were trying to make up for poor service into every meal, I'd be back once a week.
