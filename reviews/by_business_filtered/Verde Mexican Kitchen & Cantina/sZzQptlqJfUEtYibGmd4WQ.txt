Came here on a Sunday evening recently with my boyfriend before we went downtown to see Kevin Hart.   It was almost completely empty. We love Mexican and are on our way to trying every spot in Pittsburgh to find the best.  I was unimpressed with this place...especially the service.  I enjoy a good atmosphere with good company, though, so I will give it 2 stars.

It is the perfect location with a really cute atmosphere inside.  A really cool neon lit bar with a ton of different liquors on display.  It is a little industrial looking but clean and appropriate for the location.

Service was slow and our waitress was a total dud.  She seemed extremely bored and not very personable or friendly.  She offered us the restaurant week winter 2015 deal, took our drink (a Dos XX Amber for him and a red house sangria for me) orders and went to the back.  She brought out our chips and salsa, then disappeared.  About 20 minutes later, she returned to take our order....no drinks in hand.  Ten more minutes passed and she finally arrived with our drinks.  My white sangria (I asked for red, but im not the type to reject or discriminate against ANY wine) tasted like bubblegum and it was entirely too sugary.  I have no idea what ingredients were even used to make it, but it was terrible, IMO.  A few minutes later our dinners arrived.  We both ordered tacos. Boy enjoyed them, but I personally think you will find better at Round Corner Cantina for about the same price.

I couldn't tell you what the rest of their menu was like but their tacos were pretty bland and the corn tortillas stale.  I wouldn't be opposed to giving them another shot, but I am also not dying to return.
