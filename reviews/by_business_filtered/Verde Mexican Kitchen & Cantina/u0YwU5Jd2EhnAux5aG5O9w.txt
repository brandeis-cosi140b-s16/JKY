Had dinner there last week and the food was great. Clearly fresh ingredients a cut above most Mexican restaurants. The guacamole was almost perfect, with fresh chips. I had 3 tacos, all of which were very generous portions of fresh-cooked fillings (shrimp, fish and chicken). Yum. The soft corn shells are NOT commercial, in contrast to an incorrect assertion by another review. They come from Reyna's in the Strip district, an authentic and home-made source. My partner had chicken enchiladas, which I tasted. We both loved them. Similar theme: perfectly cooked and a rich, tasty, tomato-based sauce. They have 200 tequilas if you are into that, but for me I was satisfied with a nice selection of beers on tap and in the bottle. PLUS: atmosphere was pleasant and stylish, and the service was prompt and very nice. I would have to think this is the best Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh and hence 5 stars for its category.
