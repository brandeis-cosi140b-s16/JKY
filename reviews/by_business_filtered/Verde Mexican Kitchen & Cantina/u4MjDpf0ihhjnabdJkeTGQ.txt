Leap day review! Sunday dinner date girl talk night! We came to Verde for an evening of catching up and dishing! Dishing on my friends love life and enchiladas de pollo! We started with an appetizer of queso fundido. It was CHEESY. Your basic homemade chips with oily, melting, cheese. I was attempting to eat healthier then gave up that night.

The wait staff was very accommodating. It wasn't very busy and we were going at a snails pace. There seemed to be some confusion about who our server was or maybe they all work together? We had double the service! The drink selection looked so wonderful and refreshing but I am not consuming alcohol for awhile, so I decided to get cozy with a hot tea. It was lit but not bright. I really liked the atmosphere and we were seated next to a bench that had a plant wall so it felt kind of private. Bronze is what I think of when I remember the color scheme.

We both ended up ordering the enchiladas. I took my friends recommendation and she was spot on. I often have complaints that this city is "no muy bueno" in the mexican department but the dish was excellent. Flavorful chicken, and a soft sauce so that all the flavors stood out. Maybe even slightly smoky! Chipotle peppers a must hiding on my tongue! I will go back. We did after all feel so welcome that we stayed three hours. Woops!  Average pricing and right in my neighborhood!
