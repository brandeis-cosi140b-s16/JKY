We went earlier this year for the Valentines day tasting menu, which was good.  We went again last friday and weren't impressed.  

Guac - very creamy and had no salt at all.  tasted like it was from a jar.  
Chicken Flautas - The sauce was pretty good, the flautas themselves were quite bland.  Portion was small for the price.  
Veggie Tacos - these were good.  veggies were fresh and sauce was tasty
Chicken Enchiladas w/ Mole sauce - Terrible.  These were basically the above flautas covered in mole sauce.  Never before have I had an enchilada that was crunchy and had pureed chicken inside. maybe 1 spoon of feta cheese sprinkled on top.  

Drinks - wife had a white sangria which was good, I had a wine which was fine as well.  

Service was friendly, if a bit slow.  

Overall - go to Mad Mex.  better and cheaper food.
