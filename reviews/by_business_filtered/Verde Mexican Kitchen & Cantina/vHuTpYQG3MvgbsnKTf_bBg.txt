I had a really great experience here! We went for happy hour and sat on the patio.  The pitchers of margaritas for $20 was a great HH deal.  We ended up eating dinner and I have to say the chorizo tacos were the absolute bomb! Super yummy.  I also really appreciated how the manager handled a certain situation with us... We had paid our bill and just finished our drinks... but got caught up talking.  We didn't even realize they had a wait for tables at this point, because seriously the patio makes you feel like you are on vacation... so the manager came up and offered to buy us drinks at the bar if we would give up our table and move to the bar.  We were leaving anyway, but really thought this was an awesome gesture!
