WE came here for brunch on beautiful Sunday afternoon. The meal was really good. I have never had such wonderful pancakes. they were really fluffy and tasty. We also ordered Sangria pitcher which was mindblowing. We ended up getting 3 pitchers among 4 people. Staff was extremely friendly. i would highly recommend this place for brunch.
