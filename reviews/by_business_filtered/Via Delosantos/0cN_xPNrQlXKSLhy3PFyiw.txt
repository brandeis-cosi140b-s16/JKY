3.5 stars

Funky little Mexican cafe. Food was in generous portions. Atmosphere was just what you'd expect from a family-owned place, colorful and busy.

The tamales were very very good. Margaritas were fantastic. Our entrees were pretty solid. I would have liked a bit more spice to mind but overall I was pleased. For the price it was  a good dinner.

Service was a little slow and spacey. I'd say it's a decent stop to make.
