Overall I like their food. Lots of chips and great salsa..both hot and mild. always free and as many as you can eat. Beer is cold cold cold. staffer pleasant and prompt. great with drink refills. All items are delicious. Sopapillas...really good.  Best mexican food around. Pleasant , casual atmosphere and not expensive. good value for the money.
