This is one of our go-to Mexican places. They have a surprisingly extensive menu with a lot of vegetarian options and of course the classics. Their chips and salsa are muy delicioso and their margaritas are yummy. The servers are always consistently great. The only thing I don't like is their guacamole...it's creamy almost like a dip and not my guac style.
