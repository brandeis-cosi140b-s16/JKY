I had the Pollo Fundido which was awesome.  Chips and salsa were good as well, and the waitress brought us hotter salsa upon request.   Service was fast, prices are reasonable.  The Fundido was $9.95, with beans/rice was $12.95.  It looks like a small hole in the wall place, but it's right in the heart of Phoenix and fits in with the area. We will be back!
