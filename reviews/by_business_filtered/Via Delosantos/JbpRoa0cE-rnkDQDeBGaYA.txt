The best tacos I have ever had anywhere. They deep fat fry the taco shell with the shredded beef in it so it's all cooked up together. Then the lettuce, tomato, & cheese on it are perfect.

Order the tacos!

The rest is really good. Everything 4 or 5 stars.

The beer selection sucks. They have a good choice of Mexican beer but no American microbrews. The margaritas are a 4.

Did I mention the tacos?
