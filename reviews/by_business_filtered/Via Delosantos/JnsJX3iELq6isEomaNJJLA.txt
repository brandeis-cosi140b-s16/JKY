I love this place, the bar is really small but it's totally cool.  This is what I call a local neighborhood restaurant/bar.  Great food and I just tried the Carna Picada for the first time and it's my new favorite dish.  If you like jalepenos and carna asada (or pork) you can't go wrong with this dish.  Make sure you try one of the house margaritas, they are $2.99 all day, every day.  Salsa is really good and so are the chips.  This is an old school Phoenix Mexican restaurant, you can't go wrong.  I am docking it 1 star because I think the carna asada could be trimmed better, I have had some fatty pieces before in my meals.  This is something easy to fix, they just need to pay closer attention to the details.
