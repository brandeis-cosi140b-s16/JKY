I discovered this place on the recommendation of one of my coworkers about 4 months ago, and it has become my definite favorite hole in the wall mexican place, with very flavorful, smooth, red enchilada sauce and very fresh, large portions.  This is a lunch stop for me (you won't catch me in this area at night...), there is a beef quesadilla that is excellent or the mucho macho burrito will definitely fill you up, both for under $7.  The service can be brusque, but to be honest for this type of place I really don't want to interact with the servers any more than to give my order and ask for more of their salsa...
