I needed a margarita... yes, needed.  I needed it immediately and I needed it icy cold.  Closest watering hole was a mile away.... and it was open.  Via DeLosantos has a list of tequilas that is 2 pages long... you can get a terrific margarita and a good dinner for 2 for under $30.  

After our emergency first aid kit of frozen margaritas and margaritas on the rocks, we relaxed our way through 2 bowls of salsa, chips and guacamole... then came the tacos and chili rellenos....

The atmosphere is a little of Rocky Point meets garage-Quonset hut shabby Mexican craft chic.  It is ultra casual, but in my opinion, NOT seedy.  It's colorful, and loud, and comfortable with liberal use of paint.

It was the perfect way to wind down after a long day.... I think I'll have one more.

Did i mention that the house Margaritas are $.99.  Good too
