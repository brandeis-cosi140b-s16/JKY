I usually don't like Mexican food, but this was an exception!  The staff greeted us warmly and took good care of us, and were constantly asking if we were satisfied with our meal.  I just ordered a tamale and it was a little spicy, but I really don't like spicy food so it's not really my place to talk.  The food came out fast and warm.  My sister also ordered a tamale and they got it wrong, but they corrected the order and brought another one out within the minute that she brought it up.  The environment was a little eccentric, but they also have a nice outdoor patio that you can eat at all year long!  I really liked this experience and would definitely come here again!
