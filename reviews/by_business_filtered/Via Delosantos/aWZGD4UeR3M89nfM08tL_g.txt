This bar must have the largest selection of tequilas in the west with 180 choices. The bartender mentioned, at one point they had over 300. I was introduced to this one of a kind establishment by a friend and immediately became a big fan!!

Small in size it packs a huge impression, as you walk in and admire the abundance of premium tequilas on display. Inside the bar, empty tequila bottles hang upside down from the ceiling that surrounds a cozy bar. Ordered the Tacos, because that's what goes best with tequila & beer and they've done themselves proud to make a great tasting crispy taco!  Prices for food and tequila match the quality of choices, but it can get expensive if you enjoy top shelf tequila. Can't wait to come back and sample other unique choices.
