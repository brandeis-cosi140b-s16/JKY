My wife and I love this place.  Food is outstanding and the margaritas are solid, with everything being a fairly reasonable price.  Only things keeping it from being 5-stars is that the service can be hit or miss depending on who your server is and the seats (particularly the booths) aren't all that comfortable.  Really like the outdoor seating as well but it would be better if they had something else going besides cheap plastic patio chairs.
