Okay yes this place is not super trendy and yes the chips come on a plastic bowl but the food has been consistently good since I have been coming here for the past three years. When I want good, cheap authentic Arizona Mexican food I come here.  I am not sure why people are coming here expecting a high class joint.  It is in Sunnyslope and you park in a parking lot that you are not sure your car will be there when you return.  I promise it is still worth it.  The margaritas are good for what you pay and the pollo fundido is delish.
