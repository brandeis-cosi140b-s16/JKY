Great food, good portions and affordable drinks. Huge selection of tequilas, in fact, ranging from $2 for cheap margaritas to well over $20 for the highest quality tequilas. 

Wait staff can sometimes be slow, and waiting times are long immediately after work hours, but it's usually worth the wait.

The atmosphere ranges from casual to festive, and can get quite loud when one or more groups are seated. If you're looking for a yummy lunch or dinner and can handle a possibly raucous setting or medium grade service you'll be glad you came.
