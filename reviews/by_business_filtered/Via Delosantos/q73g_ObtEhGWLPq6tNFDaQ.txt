Went here for lunch with 6 work buddies, it was not that busy. The service was very slow, one they took our order the lady didn't come back to check on us or fill our drinks until the food came. After that no refills again. Very Crappy service. I ordered a beef burrito, it had hardly any meat and was stuffed with mostly lettuce. For this place being around for 20+ years, you would think they would have good food. This was not the case. 

Don't waste your money or time..
