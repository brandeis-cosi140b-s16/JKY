I don't get it. I really, really don't.  People swear by this place.  I know people that have gone here for years, and for that reason I gave it my three strikes chance.  If a place has potential, or great reviews I will generally give it three tries to see if I had just missed something previously before I will take it out of my rotation of restaurants.

Well dear Via Delosantos, you're out!

This place is a hole in the wall, so you expect it to be a lil quirky,  but I always left feeling like it was more towards dark and dingy. The service was never anything to impress on my visits, on my last visit it took around 8 minutes for our server to show up in the first place and I was considering walking out all together.  The food here is mediocre.  Definitely nice sized portions, and there are a couple winners to choose from, but with a menu this large it is expected that there will also be some losers as well.  They pride themselves on their margaritas, and maybe I am just used to stronger pours elsewhere, but I found them to be pretty weak.

Basically, I find this place to be lackluster.  I am all about supporting the mom and pop, but there are plenty of other local Mexican restaurants to choose from, so all these people that swear by this place can keep it, I'll go elsewhere.
