I am a big fan of the green chile. I have never really had good service here, but the good food makes me not mind as much. I had lunch there today. The food was served less than 5 minutes after I ordered it. The food was hot and fresh. However, the server never asked how the food was or asked if I would like a drink refill. If you are looking for good food then I recommend it. If you are all about great service then skip it.
