The salsa is by no means hot, but always taste fresh and delicious. 
As for the notorious .99$ margaritas... I think they are now $2 but still definitely get you messed up and are tasty enough for only 2 bucks. It puts some people off that the margaritas are poured from a tap like a draft beer, but once you have two or three you are fine with it. 
I witnessed such a lady make an issue with the draft margarita who insisted on having it shaken in a cocktail shaker. The bartender reassured the senorita that this was the house margarita that everyone was enjoying. She just couldn't wrap her head around it. I wanted to say "Listen lady, Its $2... and it will get you fucked up, just enjoy it"! But my reserved nature dictated otherwise.
The atmosphere and the food are above average, standard Sonora Mexican fare that is not very spicy. 
The location is ideal if your buddie's girlfriend is having a baby at John C. Lincoln hospital and you want to have the "Holy Shit! your a Dad" talk over 3 pitchers of margaritas. Because when you are done he can just walk back over to the maternity ward while you finish your green chile quesadilla.
