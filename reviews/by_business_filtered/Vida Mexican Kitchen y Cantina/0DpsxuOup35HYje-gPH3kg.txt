I really liked the atmosphere.  It's warm and inviting.  We sat at the bar and ordered the giant and I do mean giant guacamole.  It was amazing!  Such great flavor.  Do give it a try.  Don't let the $11 price tag scare you it's worth it.  Corona's at $5 a piece?  Now...that's a bit much for a Mexican restaurant.  Shouldn't that be a special. Seemed a bit pricey to me.  But overall I am a fan so I'll come back.
