Really Charlotte?  This your version of Mexican food?  This place besides being in the heart of Charlotte isn't that great.  The food is a cut below a fast food Mexican joint.  The outside part is nice and there are some good things like the sangria drinks but that is about all folks.  If you are there to chill outside for drinks and maybe some apps this is a three star.
