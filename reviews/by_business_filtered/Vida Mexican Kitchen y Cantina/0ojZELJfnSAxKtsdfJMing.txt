I came here as an out-of-towner, looking for a place to sit in the shade and have a cold drink on a ridiculously hot afternoon.  The staff was upbeat and attentive, the patio wasn't too crowded, and the music was...interesting.  (I was psyched to hear Maxwell's "Ascension", but not so psyched about the mash-up of "D.A.R.E." and "Big Time" by Peter Gabriel.)  The Partita margaritas were solid, and there was no one breathing down my neck as I sat there and read for 1.5 hours.  Might have gotten five stars if the waitress hadn't kept on calling me "Ma'am" -- I'm only 28, damn it!
