A Mexican restaurant's quality is ONLY as good as it's TEQUILA and its GUACAMOLE. I can safely say that Vida has executed both in stunning fashion, but the prices still don't justify what you're getting. 

The Positives:
The restaurant has an incredible range of tequilas that are delicious on their own or mixed in any one of their lip smacking margaritas. Grande Guacamole comes in a traditional stone mortar which they then prepare in front of you with fresh avocados, lime juice, tomato, and onion. I do love my guac, but Is it worth $10? I'm not so sure about that. 

The staff are also friendly and fun to talk to. Your food comes out promptly and cooked well. You even have the option to get it to go! 

Lighting is dark and atmosphere reminds me of a lounge where you go for happy hour. They have an upstairs area, a larger seating area, and a bar with surrounding high top tables. Colors are vibrant and I'm assuming are intended to evoke the "life" the restaurant bears as its name. 

The Cons:
Many of the menu items will cost you more than $15... even $20 for 5 pieces of shrimp, "yea but they're five really good pieces" the waitress assures me. And even if the tacos are cheaper, they're not the best items this place offers. The skirt steak and enchiladas have potential and of course their plantains are the best in Charlotte. I wasn't impressed by any of the other sides and I think that the pineapple coleslaw needs work. 

What they have mastered however, is the flavors in each dish. I'm not Mexican (even if i might look like it), but it all tastes and looks authentic to me. And by Mexican, I mean they use cilantro haha :P

I just think there's something missing from this restaurant that would make it a 5, but its not terrible enough to be a 3. You'll have a good time and eat some nice food, but you'll forget it the day after tomorrow :/

4/5
