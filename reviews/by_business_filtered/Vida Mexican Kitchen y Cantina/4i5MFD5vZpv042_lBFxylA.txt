I have read the reviews and, despite this, we decided to give dinner at Vida's another try.  No doubt, the complimentary chips and salsa were the best items we had.  My burrito was cold and, despite being advertised as "grilled" at most it was slapped on a flat-top grille for a quick minute.

My partner for the meal had the enchilada's which she thought were "excellent."  Still, she left one on the plate, so it wasn't all that good.

As you may have read, the service was decent.  We stayed away from the alcohol drinks for the reasons you've read about.  So, all in all, I think we paid about $24 for our two dinners, which wasn't bad.

We went for the convenience (live 4 blocks away) and would probably go back.  We're informed diners thanks to fellow Yelpsters!
