I'm going to have to be honest on this one, not a huge fan.  My husband and I had our rehearsal dinner here as we were looking for a cool place that would be low key.  The lady we coordinated with told us we would have a certain amount of tables in the upstairs loft.  With 50 guests, they sat up 4 tables.  It was a bit awkward with everyone standing.  The bar upstairs was fun though, all of our younger guests really enjoyed it.  I would recommend this for lunch or dinner, but do not throw a party here.
