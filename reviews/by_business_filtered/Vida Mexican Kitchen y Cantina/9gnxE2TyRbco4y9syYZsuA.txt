My wife and I went to Vida's based on good Yelp! reviews.  Once again, we were not disappointed.  Made a reservation through Open Table and were seated at a great table on time.  The restaurant was very busy due to the Eric Clapton concert later that evening.

Our server (Rick?) was awesome - perfect balance of knowledge, presentation and attention.  Chips and salsa were very good.  I had the Vida Chicken and my wife had the Lump Crab Nachos.  The chicken was good + although the queso was a bit much.  The crab tacos were a perfect small meal for my wife.

Nice, fun experience with good food, service and atmosphere.
