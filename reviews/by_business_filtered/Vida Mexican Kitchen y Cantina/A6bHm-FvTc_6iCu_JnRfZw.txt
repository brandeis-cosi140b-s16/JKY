Nice atmosphere, service and food. It is not the most authenic Mexican I have eaten but it is pretty darn good. 

Their chips were fresh, light, crispy and not too much salt. Their salsa was not spicy but it was packed with flavor. 

I ordered a dinner combo that came with three different kinds of enchiladas and rice topped with black beans. The star of the dish was the rice topped with black beans. I could eat that all day long if I could. The enchiladas were OK. They didn't look anything like how I pictured it in my head when I read the description on the menu. I finshed only half of each enchilda. 

For my drink I had a flavored mojito. It was strong and not too sweet. If you like that sort of drink the mojito is for you. As for me, I lean towards the sweeter side so it could have used a little more simple syrup. 

For dessert, I had to take it to go because I was so full. I wanted the creme brulee but the waitress said it wouldn't pack well. So I ordered the banana tres leches cake. Oh my lawdy! When I opened the container I was looking for bananas. Where were the bananas? It was soft, moist (as it should be) and was dripping nwith all the yummy goodness of all the three milks in my to-go container. It was topped with whipped cream and three different berries but the cake tasted like banana. There's the banana. It must have been a banana liquer that they put in it. It so darn good, ya'll.
