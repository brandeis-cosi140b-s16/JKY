First time here and I'm in love with Vida! Just had their Chimichanga burrito with shrimp and it was the best I ever had! It was super tasty ! Their coronitas were awesome as well! Service was exceptional. Our server Cameron was super friendly and on point. Drinks were fill and our table was kept clean through the entire meal. I'll be back soon !
