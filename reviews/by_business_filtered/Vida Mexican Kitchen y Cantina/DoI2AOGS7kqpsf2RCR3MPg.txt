Surprisingly good guessied-up Mexican food.  Be sure to get the tableside guacamole, which is as good as everybody says.  

My entree was carne asada, which was fine and tasty, although probably not quite worth the price.  Overall, the food isn't bland-- it just tastes strongly of lime and salt and little else.
