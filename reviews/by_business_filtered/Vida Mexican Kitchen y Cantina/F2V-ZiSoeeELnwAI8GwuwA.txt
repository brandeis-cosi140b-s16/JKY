Taco Sociale Tuesdays. I shouldn't have to say anything else. 
$2 tacos, $3 modelo and great service - at Epicentre
There are other great specials on other days that in combination with other nearby events and specials make Vida the perfect start to any Uptown Charlotte evening. 

I don't too much care for the chips, but the salsa is nice. The tacos were.... tacos.... so yeah... that.

There's a patio. It's awesome. you can sit on it and people watch quite effectively. 
I recommend it. 

And coronaritas.
