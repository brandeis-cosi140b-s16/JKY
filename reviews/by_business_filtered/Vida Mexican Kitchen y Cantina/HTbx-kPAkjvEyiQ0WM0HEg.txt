Great location. Cool vibe. Attentive service. . .and, sadly, that's it. We had been looking forward to trying this place for quite some time since we have seen it front center at the EpiCentre.  We finally got the chance and were completely underwhelmed.  First we started with some margaritas--these should be an easy way to please anyone. They weren't.   The skinny margarita was just awful and I've had some good ones at other places in town (such as 1900 Mexican Grill which has a fantastic one). The regular margarita was just passable.  Perhaps the premium margaritas ones are better but I suspect we won't be back to try again.

The chips and salsa were really quite good.   After devouring 2 bowls of chips because they were so good we  figured the food would dazzle us.  We could not decide among all of the delicious offerings so tried 2 of the combo platters to try a good variety of the food.  They were chock full of good quality ingredients (crab, shrimp, fish, avocados) but somehow were rendered almost tasteless. Nothing stood out, except for the fact that the soft corn tortillas were greasy. The food at a casual burrito shop is easily more pleasing.  In college I worked in an average Mexican restaurant and the entrees here didn't even come close. 

The banana tres leches cake for dessert was intensely flavored (nice change from the bland meal) but really good (if you don't fear banana flavor). It isn't a traditional tres leches so the waiter tried to steer us away from it.  I understand why, but it was very good and potent.

All in all this was a disappointment (chips, salsa and dessert excepted) and we love Mexican food. Not sure if we'd waste the calories on another try when there are so many other Mexican options in the Queen City.  That's too bad because the location is great and there aren't any other Mexican places uptown.
