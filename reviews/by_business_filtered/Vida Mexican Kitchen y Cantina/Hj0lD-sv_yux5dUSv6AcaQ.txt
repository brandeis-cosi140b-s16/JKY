I've visited Vida a few times and found myself there again last night for a drink with a girlfriend.  Upon entering, I was reminded of the main thing I don't like about it - the smell.  It's almost like they're pumping the smell of roses throughout the entire bar area, and it gave me a headache and my girlfriend an allergy attack.  Pretty grody.

The bartender was super nice, and the margaritas were decent.  I've always been a big fan of their food and the atmosphere, but the smell and drinks keep me from giving it 4 stars.
