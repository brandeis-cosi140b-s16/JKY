While trying to enjoy our very rare alone time away from the kids, the wife and I decided to tumble around Metro Charlotte to see what we could get into.
 
Hey look, there's the Epicenter. 

Passed by but took notes on Vida to look for the entrance to Enso Sushi Lounge or whatever it's called. We saw that it was to upscale for our toned down casual attire seeing as they had a rope and security guard at the front. Guess this sushi is served on naked women or something. LOL 

Erase Enso. Saw Whiskey River, sounded like a good restaurant. Low and behold its a damn club. Looked around and EVERY BUSINESS IN THE EPICENTER TURNED INTO A CLUB! Cover charge to enter boring ass Wild Wing Cafe? Cover charge to enter a regular ass bar? Cover charge for Walgreen's and Kinko's?  Get tha fuck outta here(insert gtfoh meme here)!!

It's almost midnight. Hurry up... club, bar, turn up in Walgreen's or go home? Wait Vida was still open. Guess we'll settle for that. 

Very friendly greeting, chips&salsa better than Chili's! Excellent and attentive staff(shout out to AURIEL D.) that corrected a kitchen mistake before we even noticed it. I had the combo #2. The fish taco was good, the shrimp and crab enchilada was MAGNIFICENT!  They have over 100 different tequilas according to their menu. I had one of their exclusive drinks that had a Brazilian tequila in it which was really good. Like most of you, we ate before we thought about a Yic (yelp pic). So I took a pic of a piece of their bathroom wall art. 

I highly recommend if you want to go to a restaurant without a weekend cover charge at the Epicenter!!!
