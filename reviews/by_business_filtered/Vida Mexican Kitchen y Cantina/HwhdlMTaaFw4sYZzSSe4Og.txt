I went here for happy hour one evening before dinner. We just ordered an app and a drink, but had a fantastic experience. The queso dip was unique with a strong adobo seasoning, and the margaritas were delicious! I can't wait to go back and try other dishes!  

Since my first stop I've gone back several times for just their guacamole. This is the best guacamole I've found in Charlotte, with a very decent price for the amount you get. And I keep coming back for the margaritas! This is the only place in uptown that makes a decent margarita, and one of the few places in Charlotte that makes them strong but limey. Perfect margaritas for this West Coast girl!
