There are a few things I like more than a good brunch: Cam Newton, driving a convertible, the Charlotte Bobcats winning a game and a pair of shoes that actually fit my stupid arches... 

I like Vida just as much as I like those things because they don't have just a good brunch; they have a great brunch... 

The staff was fantastic... You could barely finish your meal before they would ask if you were done with it... They do not believe in letting plates sit around and clog up a table... I like that... The refills kept coming without a lull, which was also great... 

I went for the chorizo tacos and I was not disappointed... You could probably put jalapeno bacon on anything and I'd eat it, though... lol  Seriously, scrambled eggs, cheese, cilantro and chorizo?  All wrapped in some floury goodness?  I was full midway into the second one, but I kept trying to finish... I still get a tear in my eye when I think about that last bite I left on my plate... I couldn't focus on just the tacos, though, because the potatoes they give you were awesome!  That's probably because they had jalapeno in them as well... The fruit was very good... They've got to get their stuff from a market, that wasn't grocery store fruit... lol

I loved the look of the restaurant and since we were seated upstairs, it gave us a nice view of all the goings on downstairs... The drinks were fantastic... I had Cointreau Noir and Vida margaritas... They were both sublime... The frozen Vida margarita didn't have that weird, watery taste that most frozens end up with, so I was very excited about that... 

The prices weren't bad at all, but they don't validate parking, so I would suggest going there, but making better arrangements than the dreaded Epicentre lot... lol
