I'm typically not a fan of the food at EpiCentre, but while entertaining out of town guests I decided to organize a dinner here.

The restaurant location is interesting - it faces the Ritz Carlton and has a big patio that would be fun if the weather were warmer. The bar scene looks very active and the restaurant overall has a fun, loud vibe. 

We were seated fairly quickly and had two waiters due to our group size. The menu is a fair amount of mexican standards along with some tex-mex and bbq thrown in. A lot of options to satisfy carnivores and vegans alike.

We ordered a variety of appetizers in addition to the standard chips and salsa, which were quite good. The guac, as others have stated, was excellent and a very generous serving (easily serves 3-4). The queso is also solid.

For dinner I chose the pork and green chile stew - this is a dish that I have loved ever since having it Scottsdale AZ years ago. The slow cooked pork, enveloped in a creamy green chile sauce, is just about the perfect meal (for me). This rendition was excellent and among the best I've had. The side of black bean/platain mash is also really tasty (if you ignore how it looks). Others at the table had the carne asada (thumbs up) the orange chipotle ribs (judged average) and the grilled dish (thumbs up).

Overall this is a good addition to the mexican food scene in Charlotte- a notch bellow Cantina 1511, but better than the plethora of places that have opened around South Park.
