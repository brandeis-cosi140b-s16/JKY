Yes, the food is pricey and you can find something similar or better for half the price in Starmount. But hello, this is the Epicenter and you are paying for the ambiance and the pretty crowd. I have enjoyed everything so far . . . the red sangria, shrimp tacos, this awesome pork stew thing, and even the chips and salsa.
