I ate lunch here on a Friday about 11:30 am.  I beat the lunch crowd and it wasn't very busy.  They brought over chips and salsa.  For the salsa the mix it at the table to determine the heat level.  I chose medium, which for me wasn't very spicy at all.  I ordered the the carnitas plate with green chile rice for the side.  The menu on their website says that the plates come with 2 sides, but as I tried to order  2nd side, my waiter informed me that for lunch the plats only come with one side.  OK, fine.  My food came out quickly.  The carnitas were very tender and tasty with a crisp skin.  The tortillas that came with the meal were a little dry.  The green chile rice was good.  My waiter checked back once right after I got my food, but never again until I was done with my meal.  Overall the food is very good, but a bit pricey.  The service was so-so.  Probably won't be back, but that's just my choice as I can find better places to spend my $$$.
