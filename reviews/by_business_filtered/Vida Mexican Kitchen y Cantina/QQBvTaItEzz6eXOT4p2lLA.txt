I don't know how they did it, but even on a Tuesday night when they were completely slammed with people before a concert at the arena, Vida managed to provide 5-star service and food.  From the minute we got there til the minute we left, everything was awesome!  

We started with a delicious, refreshing margarita for me and a snifter of tequila for the fella - he said it was the best tequila he's ever had.  We then moved onto dinner and I got the tacos (1 al pastor, 1 carnitas and 1 beef).  They were all really good, but i loved the pineapple on the al pastor - good mix of sweet and salty.  Fellla got the chicken taquitos, and they were crispy, light and fresh.  Our waitress, Jackie, was so engaging and personable, and she had great food/drink recommendations, and the sales and marketing VP, Andrea, even checked in on us to see how we were and chatted for a few minutes.  

I don't know how they all found the time to provide such great customer service, but it's a rare thing these days, and I love patronizing places that put such a great emphasis on it.  I'll definitely be back soon.
