I'm pretty sure every single review I've written this week has been about Mexican food. Maybe I need a chips and salsa intervention? Nahhhhhhh

I bounce between a few items here. The tuna tacos, the crab and shrimp enchiladas and my new fav- smoked salmon tacos. Smoked salmon tacos you ask.... why yes, this is in fact a brunch item. I never thought of Vida as a brunch place until I had these. All the brunch plates come with fruit and jalapeno potatoes. 

I'm a big fan of the salsa here. I love guac and queso, so sometimes I have a hard deciding which to order at a Mexican restaurant. When it comes to Vida, I go with the guac. Personal preference.

Now this is important, sit outside. IMO, Vida has the best patio for sight-seeing in uptown. And by sight-seeing, I of course mean people watching. Bubble (directly above it) also has a killer patio, but they don't have chips and salsa.

The Epicentre parking garage is a total rip-off. Unless you are heading to the movies (which validates), park anywhere else or take the lightrail here. There is an Epicentre stop. Parking on the street is free after 6pm. The Wake Forest deck (next to Fitzgerald's) is usually only five dollars. Fitz also validates that deck is you feel like popping in for a drink before you head home.
