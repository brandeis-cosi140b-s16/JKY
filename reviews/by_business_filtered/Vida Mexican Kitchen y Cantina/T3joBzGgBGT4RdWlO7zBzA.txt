My husband and I go here often for drinks and apps. The margaritas are so yummy! The service is always great, and the food is too!  We finally had dinner here for the first time and it was a great experience.  We both got burritos and loved them.  We also ordered the triple guacamole app ( its 3 different kinds of guac) & it was delicious.  We like the location too-espcially when its nice enough to sit outside.
