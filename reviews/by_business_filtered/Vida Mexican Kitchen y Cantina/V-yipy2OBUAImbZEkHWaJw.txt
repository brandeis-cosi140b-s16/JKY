5/5 stars for sure- great food, even better service. Had the mushroom flautas as an appetizer, which was awesome. John, our waiter who was GREAT, brought us salsa and chips that were really fresh and still warm- YUM. I had the grilled shrimp tacos as the main entree and they were alright. I think the main reason why I'm giving Vida five stars is because of the service: we were waiting for a friend who ended up not arriving until after closing (10 PM). We didn't know that she would also be bringing two more people with her. John gave us no problem at all. He was very courteous even though we ended up staying until past 11 PM. Overall, it was a great first experience here! I would definitely recommend it.
