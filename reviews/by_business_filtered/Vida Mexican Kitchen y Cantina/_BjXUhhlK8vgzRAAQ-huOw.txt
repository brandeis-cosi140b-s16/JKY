So I totally didn't know the difference between Vida Vida and this place... but I had frequented Vida Vida for lunch during the weekdays and just assumed it was the same place?  My bad...  So VIDA is a more sit-down restaurant type while it's neighbor is more casual... but still both very good!

Live and learn, but now that I've experienced the full blown Mexican kitchen and cantina... I may never go back to the casual.  J/K I live off of their lunch tacos!  

Dinner here the other night was pretty amazeballs.  Just finished an amazing yoga class on the rooftop and ate here afterwards.  Needless-to-say, I was super hungry and downed my bacon jalapeno shrimp tacos in no time flat.  The side rice and black beans stood no chance as well as the plate was CLEANED!

The menu has a ton of options - we even had a friend that was on some crazy paleo + diet and the kitchen was able to accommodate after lots and lots of questions ;).

It was pretty crowded (but no wait) for a table.... I'm sure this is a good spot to go before a Knights game or going out somewhere Uptown.
