Let's start by saying that the location is fantastic! Uptown is always fun! The food, however, was just ok. I got the ground beef tacos and there just wasn't any great flavor to them.. Or to the beans and rice on the side. The drinks were great... Melon and dragon berry mojitos! So good! The service was good, too. Server was attentive but not clingy. Overall, I'd recommend for late night but not dinner or lunch.
