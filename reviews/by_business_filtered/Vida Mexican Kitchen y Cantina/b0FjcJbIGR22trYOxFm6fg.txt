My family and I went to vida cantina for lunch on Saturday . They weren't that busy . We have passed by this restaurant several times and always wanted to try it . I truly wish we didn't . The food was less than average . I ordered the vida salad with shrimp . When I got it , I realized it was missing the corn and the black beans . I pointed that to the waiter . He thought about it for a second and replied .Oh , I think that is not the salad you ordered . I decided to keep it anyhow but I was disappointed . My daughter ordered the beef tacos but she only had couple of bites of it . She said , it was one if the worse beef tacos she ever had . My other daughter had combo #2 out of their combo choices which is crab and shrimp enchilada, beer battered fish taco and cheese quesadilla . Out of the combo, the only thing she enjoyed was the quesadilla and didn't care much about the fish taco .  Honestly , spending about 50 dollars for lunch for three people and not enjoying it was a big disappointment specially that the restaurant is located in the heart of  downtown Charlotte .
