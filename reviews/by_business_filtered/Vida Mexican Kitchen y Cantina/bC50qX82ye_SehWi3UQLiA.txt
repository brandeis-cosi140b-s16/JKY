Wednesday lunch. No wait. Friendly and attentive service. Excellent Bloody Mary, even if it was served in a clear Solo cup.
We shared taco platters - veggie, fish, shredded beef, Philly, carnitas. All the tacos were ok nothing to write home about, but the corn tortillas were fried (read: soaked) in some kind of oil that sat in my stomach like a rock later. 
I had an incident with the kitchen that was immediately addressed by the waitress and the manager. They did everything to correct the problem and I did leave pleased. 
TVs everywhere. Seats are those horribly uncomfortable chairs from elementary school, adult sized. Decent music, not too loud for daytime. Clean bathroom, but only 1 for the ladies.
