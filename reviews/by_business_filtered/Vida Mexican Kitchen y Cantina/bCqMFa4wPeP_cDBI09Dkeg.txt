My fiancee and I were in Uptown a few weeks ago and wanted to stop somewhere for Sunday lunch.  We found Vida and I have to say that the Yelp reviews do not do this place justice.  It was so delicious!  

I had the chicken and roasted corn enchilada and my fiancee had the green chile pork and avocado enchilada.  Both came in the perfect portion size and were amazing.  However, I do have to say that the green chile pork and avocado enchilada was much better than my meal - I kept stealing bites off my fiancee's dish.

I also enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant and the service was great (caveat: this was Sunday lunch and it wasn't crowded - not sure what it's like on a typical Saturday night).
