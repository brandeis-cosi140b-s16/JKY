Perhaps Cinco De Mayo wasn't the best way to make a first impression but at least I finally can say I made it to Vida.

As you can imagine the place was packed, I like that there's seating inside and outside and they have two different options for dining. My friends and I scored a table close to the bar and quickly ordered some margaritas. The strawberry and original with sugar around the rim were my clear favorite! If margaritas aren't your thing....they have tequila!!!! Yum! 

To snack on we ordered the nachos with chicken....meh, they were just okay. I could have used a little more chicken and a little less black beans but they were fine for sharing. If I went again I'd try something else...maybe the tacos since they had some pretty interesting combinations on the menu!
