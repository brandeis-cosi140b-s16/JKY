We came in here with a pretty large group during Alive After 5 and the staff was prepared and friendly enough to accommodate us. It wasn't very busy at all, so I would say this is a good spot to eat after happy hours in the Epicentre. The only problem is the food is pricey for that idea when you just want bar food or simple tacos, where this is more of a premium Mexican restaurant.

Speaking of the food, I had the chicken tinga, which was just ok despite the fun I had saying the name aloud multiple times. A great idea with red chile sauce, chicken, and a fried egg on top, but it could have used more spice. We also had the combo #1 which I thought was a good deal with multiple tacos and mildly priced. 

Nice spot conveniently located in the Epicentre but there are plenty of options around which hurts the repeat visits.
