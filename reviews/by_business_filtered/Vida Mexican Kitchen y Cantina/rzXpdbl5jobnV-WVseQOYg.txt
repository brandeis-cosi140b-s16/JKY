Not good at all. I had the tuna tacos and my wife had the bacon, shrimp tacos. Both were tasteless. The rice was so dry it was inedible and the black beans were straight out of a can.  

The service was slow and non existent. We asked for lemons for water twice, refill of salsa that never came, another beer which also never came, and they allow smoking outside in the patio!!  No one wants to sit beside a cigarette during dinner. When we asked about the state law they said they allow people to smoke on the patio anyway. 

$45 for 2 crappy meals and a beer! We will not be back!
