I am a huge Mexican food fan. I heard so many good things about this place so my expectations were high. Unfortunately, I felt like the good was bland and average at best. The chips and salsa were pretty good, but other than that.. not impressed. I also think the food is overpriced. This is probably just because of it's location. One plus is the portions are large so you won't leave with an empty stomach!

Wouldn't recommend to a friend.
