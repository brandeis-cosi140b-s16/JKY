A bit pricey, but it is "high-end" Mexican cuisine. I've tasted various items on this menu, from the combos, to the tacos and burritos, everything is always so well prepared. I've experienced a few soggy tortillas at times, but that's just to be expected when dealing with corn tortillas. The service is always outstanding, the bartenders are always attentive and accommodating. While this is not as "authentic" as going to a mom and pop type of Mexican restaurant, the spin they put on it helps you indulge in the flavors of Mexico without worrying about eating too much. Aside from that, the frozen margarita has me feeling so good by the end of the meal that I can never order less than 1. Vida is definitely a staple (for me), just as long as they keep making those margaritas just right.
