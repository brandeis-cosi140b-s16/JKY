Get to the Chase:

Pros:
1) Waiters are very polite and attentive. Love it! 
2) Great for mimosas! PERFECT pre-game, post-game, and any game. 
3) Reasonably priced, you'll leave feeling you got what you paid for without having a lighter wallet

Cons:
1) Sadly, the food doesn't come up to par with the drinks...nothing special, just overly thought dishes
2) Completely empty at peak lunch hours, which should have been fair warning to not indulge my hunger at such a place

Overall, I've had better mexican...gives you the tacky feeling of a mexican chain (whether that be true or not, I just felt like I'd be better off at a Chipotle or Qdoba)
