We came here the other night to just grab a round of drinks before we headed to dinner at a different place - but after 1 hour, 1 pitcher of sangria, and 4 mojitos - we were hooked. Not sure if it was the drinks or the addicting chips and salsa they kept feeding us. Either way - we ended up spending close to another 2 hours drinking and eating. For dinner I would recommend the chicken and shrimp fajita. It's delicious and serves enough food for two! 

Oh and love the atmosphere....and the music!
