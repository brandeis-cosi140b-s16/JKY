I have been here twice and after the first time I realized that this isn't the best mexican food out there. I have had better mexican in Charlotte. However it is a good place to have drinks while catching up with friends. 

I enjoy spicy mexican food so Vida isn't the best option for me, but those who do not like spicy do enjoy this place. 

I have had their margaritas and they are great. Their guacamole is also really good and their salsa is good, the spicy salsa (you have to ask for it) is really good and definitely has a kick.
