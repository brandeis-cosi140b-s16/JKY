Not your run of the mill Mexican restaurant. This is a first class dining establishment. The atmosphere is new clean and contemporary. The food is fabulous and the staff is friendly. I highly recommend viva mercados to anyone. I was interested in eating lite the night I attended and that was not a problem because they had a great vegetarian section on the menu. Don't want to forget great bar and happy hour.
