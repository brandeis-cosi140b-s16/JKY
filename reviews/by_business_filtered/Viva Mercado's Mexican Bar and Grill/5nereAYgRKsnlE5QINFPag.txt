Fantastic food. Excellent service. They start the table with bottom-less chips, homemade salsa, and beans. Next is a tomato bisque. Then your entree on a plate big enough to feed a small country, seriously my husband and I have big appetites and we could have easily shared a meal and both been full. Also complimentary fried jalape√±o and grilled onions if you ask. Don't think twice about it the food is amazing
