This is our 2nd time here (first time at the new location). The atmosphere and decor are very nice and the restaurant was clean. We were seated right away and immediately had someone bring us chips, salsa and beans. They were good but I prefer Coyote's chips better because they put seasoning salt on theirs. However, everything else was excellent!
