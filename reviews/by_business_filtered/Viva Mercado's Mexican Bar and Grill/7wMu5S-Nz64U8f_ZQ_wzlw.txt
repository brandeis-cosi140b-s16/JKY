My gf and I have been fans of Viva Mercado's since their first location on Flamingo and Jones years ago, we liked them so much we even followed them to their next location on Spring Mountain and Rainbow, till it closed a few years ago. We always order the same 3 tacos and margarita special at the bar. We came to this new location expecting to be able to order the same special and were told that it no longer exists! We were also told that frequent diner stamp cards are not accepted anymore! What the heck Viva?? We can't support you any longer if you don't look out for the fan base that got you to where you are!
