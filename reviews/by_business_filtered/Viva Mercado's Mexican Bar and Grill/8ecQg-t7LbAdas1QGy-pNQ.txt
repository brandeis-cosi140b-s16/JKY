I finally decided to give this place a try and made a bold move to done-in with my 1 year old. The moment I walked in I was immediately seated and served chips, salsa and bean dip. They took our drink order and had them at the table a minute later.

I ordered the lunch combination plate with a veggie tamale and chili relleno. Served with beams and rice. My kids ordered quesadillas and chicken enchilada off the kids menu. One got a side of beam and rice the other two fries. I loved the face they have other side options for children. I must admit that was some of the best food we ever had eating out! Full of flavor and great portions .

The customer service is the best I've ever had in all of Las Vegas and California! There was not a moment I had to go searching for help. The waiter was always there when we needed him and always made sure we had full glasses of our drinks. Despite the few mishaps we had, the servers never took a smile off their faces and even brought out some of the best banuelos we've ever had.

If I had to make a choice to dine out with my kids, it will always be here. Very kid/family friendly. Love the welcoming atmosphere.
