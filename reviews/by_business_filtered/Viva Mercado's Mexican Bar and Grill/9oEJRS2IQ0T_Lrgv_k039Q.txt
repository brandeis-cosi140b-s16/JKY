Is it Almost Excellent Food and Service? Not only is the meat prepared fresh it is good juicey and flavorful. Not sitting out dried and bland. They actually cook your food well. Some dishes are not seasoned well but at least offer well cooked meat. Sauces should be made not canned. Perhaps if the menu was streamlined this could work, too many choices and offerings. Stick to a few authentic recipes and this place would rule. Even with canned sauces it was better than most. In Las Vegas however this is as good as it gets. The outside decor looks like a cheap sports bar but inside the staff is hospitable and atmosphere inviting. Pre dinner food is tasty but not better then other Mexican equivalent offerings... That being said no dry over heated meat and some fresh seasonings. Get some authentic homemade sauces that aren't purchased at the local Mexicali grocery store then we are talking. Season your own food! Don't use a can!
But I'll pay for the well cooked meat and fresh garnished meals again. This is the best in the area but I know it could be better.
