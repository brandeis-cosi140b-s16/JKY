I am originally from El Paso, TX and am very picky when it comes to mexican food. Ive been coming here since I was a kid when they were on Jones Im 31 now so thats a long time. Anytime I go out of town I am on a search for good mexican food and hardly none ever compare to here. This place is the BEST mexican restaurant in Vegas and my family and I are here probably on a weekly basis. I normally have the combination plate with steak taco and chicken enchilada or the chicken firecrackers which are somewhat like taquitos with jalapeno in them SOOOO GOOD. My husband has had lots of different options like seafood burrito, steak taco, tamales, chicken quesadilla and hes never had a complaint. We also love the complimentary soup with dinner meals and complimentary chips salsa and bean dip they start u off with. I normally also get some of the specialty salsas like habanero and arbol. The sopapillas are very good as well! My kids also love it and ask to come here all the time. The staff is always so friendly and accomodating and are used to seeing us so much. We always make lots of alterations to our meals and they handle it with no problem. I LOVE the new location very clean and modern looking and will continue to come here as long as Im living in Vegas! If u like mexican food as much as I do this is the place to go!!
