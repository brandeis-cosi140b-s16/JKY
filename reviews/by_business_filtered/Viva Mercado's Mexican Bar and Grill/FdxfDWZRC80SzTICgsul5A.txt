One of my favorite local Mexican food spots in town!  Great service, great food, and it's not overly pricey.  

The chips are standard but the bean dip and salsa are awesome.  I personally like the kind of salsa they provide.  There are some good dishes here, the Boracha, Chile Verde enchiladas, fish tacos (Basso instead of Tilapia), chicken fajitas and even the combo dinners are good picks.

For dessert, the churros and flan are my picks here.
