This was just exactly what I was looking for.  Great service, fresh food with all of the accompaniments I like and a comfortable atmosphere.
The menu is so huge it is sort of hard to know where to start.  My friend and I split the Chicken Mole and the Steak Borracha.  The steak was the clear winner and even without ordering separate appetizers the portions were so large we had leftovers.  
I really liked the touch of the grilled jalapeno and look forward ot exploring more of the menu.
