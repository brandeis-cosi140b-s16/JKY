Until today, this was one of my husbands and my favorite restaurants. We came in for Sunday Brunch with our 4 month old baby. We were having a nice time until a Mariachi band came through the door. Another table had booked this band for themselves. The band proceeded to play and sing so loud that our meal together was effectively over. The baby started screaming and cowering because the music was hurting her ears and I couldn't hear a word my husband was saying. Other tables of diners looked very unhappy as well. The manager offered to move us but I told him it wouldn't have made a difference, the music was so loud. I had to take the baby outside multiple times and my husband had to eat alone. I kept trying to come back inside to the table but the loud music would drive me back out again. I explained to the manager one of the times I came back in that it had ruined our meal, hurt the baby, and it was not okay. I understand that those people who hired the band were trying to do something nice for each other but the restaurant shouldn't have allowed it to upset the other guests. They didn't ask the band to take it down a notch, didn't apologize, and charged us full price for a ruined meal. We won't be back due to the way they allowed our experience to be ruined and didn't even attempt to make it right.
