Overall food was good. Ordered 3 item combo. Was really disappointed with the Chicken Tamale. Inside masa was kinda icy cold, chicken was dry, very little sauce, masa edges dry and tough. Kind of like they microwaved frozen tamales?
I took two small bites & left the rest. 
A good waiter should ask if anything was wrong with food upon seeing barely eaten tamale? I will eat here again but won't ever order Tamales here again. 
Service was mediocre. We were seated quickly as place was near empty but had to ask for utensils. Long wait for food. Rest of food was good & worth 4 stars but because of the Tamales & service a 3 star at most.
