Simply one of the best Mexican food restaurants I have ever been to.

First, chips and salsa came. Duh. Salsa was good, not as spicy as I like it, but delicious. Bean dip came too, as a nice surprise. I love me some bean dip.

Next, we were brought a plate of sautéed veggies, which were outstanding.

THEN, a soup. It was a red sauce based soup with wheat spaghetti in it. I'm not sure what it was even called, but it was delicious.

FINALLY, my husband and I ordered. Per Luis' recommendation, our amazing server, I ordered the seafood chile rellano. My husband ordered the carne asada with sautéed veggies on top (sort of like fajita veggies). 

My seafood rellano was outstanding. It was loaded with cheese, stuffed to the brim of the most tender variety of seafood, and the chile was perfectly battered.

My husband's carne asada came medium rare, as asked, and cooked to perfection. It was the best carne asada we had ever tasted, and we dine at Mexican food places A LOT.

For complimentary dessert, we even got a fried tortilla in cinnamon and sugar. Phenomenal, outstanding, and IMPECCABLE service. Luis was so great we had to tell the owner's son just how fantastic he was. 

We cannot wait to come back. It will be at least a monthly thing in our household.

The best part of all, we both had leftovers this afternoon that were enough to be considered a totally new meal. Each plate of food is definitely two servings, even for the hungry bellies.
