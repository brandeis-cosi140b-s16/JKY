I like to eat at the bar because I'm a huge sports fan!, and they have a great bartender that makes phenominal drinks, but it seems like every time I've been in there, he's always working an looks a little run down, but always friendly.  Probably would suggest you hire more reliable bartenders like the one that's always there.
