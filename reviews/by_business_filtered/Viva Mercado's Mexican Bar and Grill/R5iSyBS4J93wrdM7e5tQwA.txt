My boyfriend and I were heartbroken when our favorite Mexican restaurant closed. How exciting it is to have Viva Mercado's back and better than ever! The new location is absolutely beautiful inside, and still offers the same friendly atmosphere, like you are eating at a friends house. Service is kind and attentive. Now the best part.....the food!

The complimentary chips, salsas, and bean dip, are always a winner! :)

Apps:

Queso Fundido - Yum! This ooey gooey dish is so tasty! Definitely messy, but that just makes it more fun to eat. 

Chili Con Queso - This was a bit spicy for my taste, but my boyfriend loved it. However, I found that I kept eating it despite the spice, so it must have been good! lol

Guacamole - One of my fave things on the menu! Super fresh and delicious, my boyfriend is lucky if he gets any at all!

Main Dishes:

I have tried most of the dishes available for the combination platters, and I have thoroughly enjoyed them all! One of my favorite parts is the sopa de fideos. I don't know what it is about this simple soup, but I love it! 

If I had to chose my favorites, it would definitely be the crispy shredded beef tacos and the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. They are definitely my two go to dishes here. The chili verde is very good as well.....and the tamales......and the burritos....and the tostadas......I could go on and on and on! 

Dessert:

We don't always make it to dessert, which is a shame because the churros, fried ice cream, and sopapillas are all wonderful!
