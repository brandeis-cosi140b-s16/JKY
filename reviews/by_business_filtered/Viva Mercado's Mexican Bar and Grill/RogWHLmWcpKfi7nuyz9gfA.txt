Went here for dinner and had an awesome experience. The staff is very nice and our waiter Luis was GREAT. He was courteous and efficient and very friendly. I ordered the steak and pork fajitas and my date ordered the enchiladas suizas. Both dishes were absolutely delicious. They came out quickly and were very flavorful. The meat was juicy and tender, the guac is fresh and the chips, fried beans and salsa they give while you wait was delicious. Definitely will be coming back!
