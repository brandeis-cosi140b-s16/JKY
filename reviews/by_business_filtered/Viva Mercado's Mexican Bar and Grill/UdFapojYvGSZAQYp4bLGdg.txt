The food is quality here!  I can't truly complain about much.  I don't think the breakfast steak served as carne asada on the lunch menu is appealing but it did taste decent, just not big enough.  The mulitas are awesome!!!  Great chips and salsa and the ambiance is great.  I am not a fan of the tapatio being served in packets.  Just one persons humble opinion.  We will def be back!
