Have dined in here once with my girlfriend the place was fairly busy food was good , but the wait was really long waited about 40 minutes for an our food , they kept refilling the complimentary chips while we waited for all that time , until late the time we got our food we felt really full and couldn't even finish the half of what we ordered. I had the the steak fajita and girlfriend had the chicken even though we were frustrated with the wait but we liked the food . 5 stars for food and 1 star for service/wait. 3 stars overall,  will come back and will update my review if things are changed.
