As a former Tex-Mex lover from Austin, TX, this fare is the best Las Vegas has to offer everything is so good. The servers make it exactly like you wish and will remake it if it is delivered incorrectly.

When I ask for salsa with fresh jalapeño they don't mind delivering. They offer free sauteed onions and jalapeño s upon request and their Carne and pollo Asada is very tasty. 

Our family loves this place and the owners too. Thanks Viva!
