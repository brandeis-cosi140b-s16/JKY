I've never been the biggest fan of Mexican food but I must say that this place was a delight. My wife and I found it using Yelp and we're definitely not disappointed. The decor was warm and inviting and the service was probably the best I've had in many many years anywhere! Our waiter was a guy named Jay and he was amazing. The entire staff worked together as a team and perhaps that's why I'm ranking the service so highly. 

Realizing that it was our first visit to the restaurant they brought us a free appetizer which was delicious and very unexpected. Our drinks were constantly filled, fresh napkins brought, and even the chips and salsa refreshed before we hit the bottom of the bowl. Finally the manager whose name is Bobby Mercado stopped by and asked how we enjoyed our experience. From the manager on down everybody was delightful and genuine. The food was very good even though I'm not the biggest fan of Mexican food. My wife is the expert on Mexican food and she thoroughly enjoyed her meal. My wife and I don't have to worry about dinner tonight either because the portions were large enough where we now have another meal taken care of. We will both definitely go back soon.
