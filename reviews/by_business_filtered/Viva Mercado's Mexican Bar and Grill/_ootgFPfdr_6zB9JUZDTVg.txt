We had a great dinner here! The food comes with fideo soup, and at the end they surprised us with a great sopapillas dessert! It was delicious, and the service was great. I do admit though that it comes with a lot of food. I'm stuffed but it very pretty delicious! It is more authentic Mexican food by the way. I recommend the restaurant to really any ages and it is very casual attire. There is even food for the kids (a kids menu) which turned out to be good as well. Try Viva Marcodos out some time!
