We found this place accidentally when we were grabbing pies from Coldstones. Boy are we glad we did. The service is OUTSTANDING! Luis was our server and let me tell you, we will always ask for him. He was nice, attentive, fast, friendly and an absolute joy. The rest of the staff was amazing as well. The drinks were fantastic and hit the spot. The food? OMG! Best mexican food we've had in a while. The entire experience was phenomenal and we will be back. I think we found our new spot. Thank you Luis and all your amazing staff. You guys ROCK!!!
