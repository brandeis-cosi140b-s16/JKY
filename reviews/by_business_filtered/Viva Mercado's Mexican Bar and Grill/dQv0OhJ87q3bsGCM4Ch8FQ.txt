Sooooo let me tell y'all, I love Mexican food.  & this place def have the atmosphere for some good Mexican food. I went in here on my mother'a day for brunch with my family & immediately we got greeted & got seated in a nice comfortable booth. & wow the food menu was big & every item sounded super good so I had to order my favorite chicken fajitas & it was delicious. Also I had a strawberry mimosa. I was full within 5 mins haha food portions are def huge & filling. Appetizers are also very good. Im giving this place 5 Stars because this spot is a authentic Mexican restaurant & had great service & I had a great Time.
