My only complaint about this place is that they don't know the difference between a Flauta and a Enchilada. If something this basic can't be figured out, I'm skeptical about everything else on the menu. Ordered a flauta, expecting to get a crunchy rolled tortilla and got a cheesy, soft enchilada...whaaaat?!?! Yeah, no. C'mon guys! That's a shame.
