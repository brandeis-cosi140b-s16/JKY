This place was SO GOOD. we loved the seafood taquitos. The service was great. I recommend the peach margarita. I got the fish taco (so delicious), the chicken tamale (a little different since it's more open-faced but it's good!) and the beef burrito (the beef was SO GOOD. Stole the show for me.)

We pretty much decided this is our New Mexican place! I wanna come back tomorrow but I have a lot of leftovers since we ate so much!
