So glad we tried this place. Great atmosphere. Excellent excellent service!!!  Happy hour menu. Beer was ice cold. Complimentary chips & salsa with bean dip. My bf got the camaron diablo and it was excellent, big shrimp, rice and beans. I got the fish tacos with rice and beans. Big portions. And they give you a complimentary dessert :) we will definitely come back!
