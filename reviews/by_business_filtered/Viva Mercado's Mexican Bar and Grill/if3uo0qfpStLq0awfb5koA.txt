Mr. Mercado,
I kindly appreciate your feedback. The beer that took so long was the first.  The question about temperature that I had is because I don't understand why the rice didn't come out warm nor hot. The salsa that was brought out initially was not good, our server brought out a salsa level 5 which then... I said tasted like my moms. 

I did take the albondiga soup home and it was not good at all.  The A grade was not visible Sir but I will not question you as the information is online on SNHD.

Another thing is that I nor my family drink ice tea nor water that sits on a server station because of our industry. So why would my husband want to drink "Diluted" mountain dew. That is where the comment came from.

I know Mexican food as my father is from Durango and my mother is from Chihuahua. I accept that nothing will be like home cooking but please don't make it sound like this is authentic.  I wish as a business owner you would consider taking constructive criticism and better the issues that your patrons make instead of defending yourself.
