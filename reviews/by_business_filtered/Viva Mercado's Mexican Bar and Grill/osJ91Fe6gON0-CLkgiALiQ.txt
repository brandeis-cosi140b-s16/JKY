my husband and I live near the old location on spring mtn and rainbow. we always drove by the place and wondered what happened to the restaurant. I did some research and found out what happened and the back story.

saw all the great reviews and decided to check it out tonight while we had a friend visiting. atmosphere was great, food was great, we got most of the things on the happy hour menu. I got beef sopes and my husband and his friend got the chicken tacos. husband's friend got 2 beers and then we had 2 margaritas each.

When we got our bill we were charged for 5 margaritas, we told our waiter about it and he apologized and said he'd get it fix. Next thing you know the manager came over and pretty much interrogated us about why we were only going to pay for 4 margaritas and not the fifth one. 

We definitely didn't like the manager's attitude about the situation then he stood with the waiter only a table away from us, in front of other guests, and argue with each other about what had happened. 

Not sure if we'll go back, but hopefully the experience will be a little bit better next time.
