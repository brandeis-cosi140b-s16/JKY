WOW. Wonderful authentic food combined with exceptional service make for an optimal dining experience.
Coming from the Northwest (and a heartbreaking shortage of authentic Mexican cuisine), we were camping for a week when a hankering for burritos kicked us in the pants. We hopped on Yelp! and were taken right to Viva Mercado's - it was anything but a disappointment. 
Reasonable wait times and a lively, decorative atmosphere had us chomping at the bit upon catching eye and nose of the hot meals being served to parties nearby. Everything - the chips, sopa de fideo, haba√±ero salsa, fajitas - was absolutely spot on. A perfectly balanced margarita, vegetarian and vegan friendly menu items (in Vegas?! Yes!), and the best damn service at a restaurant we've ever had were the perfect combination of filling and delicious. 
Special shout out to Ignacio, our server, for absolutely killing it on the server grind. Great job, Ignacio, I'll be asking for you every time I go to Viva Mercado's.
Overall, superbly delicious Mexican food with a friendly, energetic, and lively vibe. Highly recommended!!!
