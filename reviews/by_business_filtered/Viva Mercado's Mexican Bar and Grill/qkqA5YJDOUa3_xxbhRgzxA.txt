Very fast, very prompt service. Never had to wait for anything whether it be chips and salsa, or for them to clear an empty plate. Fastest service we've ever had and everyone was very polite. Only thing I think I can say a minor negative thing about was the margaritas we ordered which were peach and mango were a little on the lighter side, couldn't taste the tequila really but that's all the bartender, not the restaurant. Food was excellent, not greasy. I would recommend highly
