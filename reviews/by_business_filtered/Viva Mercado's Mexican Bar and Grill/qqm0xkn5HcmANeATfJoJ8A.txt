Wow, one word: awesome! My girlfriend and I were looking for a dinner place before a movie in the shopping center and happened upon this place. We left beyond impressed.

We were seated immediately, and Alfredo was our awesome waiter. They keep the free chips, salsa, and bean dip coming! We had a good pitcher of margarita, reasonably priced, and the food, including the sopa de fideo, was deeelish. My lady had a tamale, I had an enchilada and one of the best fish tacos I've ever had. I might just get a couple of them next time. The Mexican rice was good... I really have no complaints... Ok, one complaint... we sat by a fountain that kept splashing me. Minor considering the overall great experience.  We'll be back soon!
