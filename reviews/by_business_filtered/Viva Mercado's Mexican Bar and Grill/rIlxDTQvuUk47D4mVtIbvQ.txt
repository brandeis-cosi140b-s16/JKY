Every single time I have came here to eat, I am always more than pleased with the service and food. The food is always excellent. They do not use lard which majority of Mexican restaurants do and they cook their food with canola oil. The waiters work together to make sure you have what you need and have awesome attitudes about it. When I went in one time, we probably requested five or six additional items and they had great attitudes about it as if they actually WANTED to help and satisfy me! That is why I always come back and back again. I have nothing but positive things to say about this restaurant, food, and the best customer service I have ever received in Las Vegas, period.
