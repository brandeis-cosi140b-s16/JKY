Surprisingly good HH place: 3-6PM daily, with cheap drinks (including a large $4 glass of sangria!) and multiple $5 food specials. Combine both and add in their free chips, salsa, bean dip, and grilled peppers/onions, and you've got a large meal for under $10.

Sangria isn't as fruity as I like- seemed like the fruit was added for presentation but not present in flavor. Chips weren't too oily, tasted fresh with a light sprinkle of salt. Salsa and bean dip were decent. Tried the fish tacos on the specials menu, one of the healthier options on corn tortillas with grilled fish instead of traditional fried. Filling portion, great price.

DÃ©cor is nicer than the exterior led me to expect, bartender was a really nice guy. You could spend a week hitting all the HH places in this plaza alone but this is one I might actually return for. 3.5 stars, rounding down until I try more of the menu.
