Heard good things about this place, so my lady and I decided to try it. The food was delicious, salsa was good along with the bean dip. Also had some seasoned  cooked chilies and onions... goes real good with the meal. The carnitas was flavorful and chicken enchilada was good... Definitely give this place a try, the place was clean, the staff was nice and the food was pretty good. Looking forward to try different things on there menu. They also have a small outdoor seating area, good place to chill and have a few drinks.
