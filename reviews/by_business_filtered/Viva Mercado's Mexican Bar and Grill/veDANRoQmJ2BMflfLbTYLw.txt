I have been frequenting Viva Mercados since they were a tiny hole in the wall on Jones. We absolutely love the barbacoa and usually don't deviate from deliciousness!  9 years ago we moved to Henderson but make the 45 minute trek across town as it is so worth the drive. Take out of town visitors there whenever we can.
