We came here for a late lunch and were very pleased with our food and the service.  I had been to their old location a few times but somehow had always overlooked the new place tucked in the corner of Village Square even though I'm here for movies often.

We were seated promptly, brought our iced teas, and given plenty of time to look over the lunch menu.  We were also brought chips and salsa and refried beans.  The salsa was very good with a very nice tang to it.

My wife ordered the pollo ala Mexicana and I ordered thew chicharrones with nopales.  Both dishes were very good.  Each was served with refried beans and a small salad.  I wish the nopales were fresh but they were pickled and mixed in with the chicharrones.  

We were looking at the dessert menu when a server brought us some fried tortillas dipped in cinnamon and sugar with a dollop of whipped cream and cherry and some chocolate syrup.  There was no need to order dessert.  This was just the small kind of ending we were looking for.

Service was excellent!  Our iced teas never wanted for refills and the food is good.  I like the layout of the restaurant and it's larger than it appears from the outside.  There's a small patio dining area to make of use of now that it's getting cooler and we'll have to come back.  Viva Mercado's is close to being a 4 star place.  I hope to up the rating after another visit.
