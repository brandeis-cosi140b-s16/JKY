Went for first time today.  
Was a very good experience.
While it is true I have had better refried beans, the fish taco and carnita taco I had on the combination plate were great. Lots of food and good fresh food.
Service was quick and friendly.
I am definitely putting this place on a have to go at least once a month basis.
