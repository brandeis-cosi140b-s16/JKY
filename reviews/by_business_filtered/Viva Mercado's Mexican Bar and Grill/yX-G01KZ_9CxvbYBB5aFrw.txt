Reserved the back room for a group gathering of 30-35 people.  Management was hard to work with to set up the dinner.  They wouldn't set the dinner up on a Friday or Saturday even though we we're making reservations more than two weeks in advance. On the night of the dinner we had 28 people show up. I was told that because we didn't have 30 people they were going to charge us $15 per person that didn't show up. I told them that was unacceptable and that we would take our business elsewhere in the future.  They did back down from the charges. The other issue we ran into with this location is that they wouldn't split the checks and only agreed to do a check for each table which created quite a bit of confusion for everyone in the party and for the server.
The food is good at this location and our server was outstanding.  But the management's lack of customer service for a large group has made our decision to take our business to one of the other Mexican restaurants an easy one.
