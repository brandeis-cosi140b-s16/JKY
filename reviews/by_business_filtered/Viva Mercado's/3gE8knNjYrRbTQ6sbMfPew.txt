This place has hands down the best salsas I have seen.  Our waiter was cool and didn't mind bringing a large selelction of the 15-some-odd salsas.  From mild to spicy, they were all very good.  I recommend the tomatillo green salsa (I think it is #7).

The menu is very extensive with food for both the unadventurous gringo and authentic-food lover.  Everything my party had looked tremendous, but the fajitas looked a bit underwhealming.
