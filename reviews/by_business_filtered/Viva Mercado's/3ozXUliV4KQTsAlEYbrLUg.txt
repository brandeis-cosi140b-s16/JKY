I completely disagree with the 5 star rating for this place.  I ate here the first weekend I moved into Vegas, excited for some good mexican good.  We went for lunch, the place was busy and I had pretty high expectations.  The rice and beans weren't doing much for me and the enchiladas did even less.  I'm not sure why people are saying its the best mexican food in Vegas. The service was not great, since we were trying to get in and out to get back to work.  The best part was chips and salsa at the beginning with bean dip, mostly downhill after that.  Somebody message me and tell me where the actual best mexican good in town is at please!
