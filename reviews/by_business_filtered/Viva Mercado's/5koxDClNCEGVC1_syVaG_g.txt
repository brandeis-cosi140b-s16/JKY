This family owned & operated Mexican restaurant is located in the WalMart center at Rainbow/Spring mtn.

We went to dinner around 8pm and there was no wait we were seated immediately. The decor is authentic Mexican with Mariachi and all.

They start you off with chip,beans and salsa and a little cup of soup. Service was exceptional. Fast,friendly and efficient.

I ordered the 1 pound carne asada burrito with rice and beans, Melissa had the cheese enchilada combo and Miles had a hamburger with fries.

The food was great, very cheesy, the meat was well seasoned and tender, the salsa had a nice little zing to it and the rice & beans were cooked perfectly.

This was a great dinner experience.A little pricy unless you go for the lunch special.
