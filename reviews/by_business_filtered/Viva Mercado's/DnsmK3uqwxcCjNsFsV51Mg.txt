Very mediocre.  I went based on the ratings here but was very disappointed.  It's your typical americanized mexican food, giant portions smoothered in cheese as sauce. Our meal came out very quickly, which is a sign that things are premade and then just blasted under a salamander.  Nothing tasted fresh, I think that they smoother it with cheese to cover it up.   For the price, I would expect a lot better.
