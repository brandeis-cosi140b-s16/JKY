Average to better than average Mexican/American food, for Vegas that is. Anyone from the coast has certainly tasted better. Portions are very large, food is good, not great. Restaurant was packed on a Saturday night, all Anglos. This city is 26% Latino, so not a good sign . Margaritas tasted like Kool-Aid. Two entrees, one margarita and tip, $50.00 For rice and beans? Overall better than a national chain.
