A longtime Las Vegas visitor, I always would ask locals where the best Mexican food could be found. That's how I first learned of Viva Mercados and, after my first visit, I've been hooked ever since. The food is great, the menu extensive, the atmosphere enjoyable and the service top notch. My last visit a few weeks ago reinforced that the quality (and quantity)  is still outstanding. The chile verde is good, but then I can't recall ever having anything I didn't like. The chips with beans and salsa will get things started right.  Next time you visit LV, get away from the Strip and find out what is probably the best Mexican food option in town.
