I cant believe this place has any bad ratings. I have been eating there for about 20 years and have NEVER had a bad experience. The food is amazing and cant be compared to anywhere else. The service is inpeccible. My family goes there for nearly every birthday dinner and only once was I slightly disappointed by the fact that I did reserve w/ a credit card for a large party to arrive and they knew nothing of it but they did quickly correct the problem and gave us a private room. keep up the great work,service and yummy food Viva Mercados.
