I frequent Las Vegas, and such food on the strip gets to be a bit redundant.  While visiting this past July, I decided to take fellow Yelper's advise and drive to Viva Mercados.  I am so happy that I did.  This has to be one of the best Mexican Food places in all of Las Vegas.  

This restaurant is quite a ways off the strip, so you will definitely need a car to get here.

I went to dinner around 7 or 8 pm and was seated immediately.  
The warm tortilla chips, beans and salsa are delicious.  I have never dined at an establishment that offered beans for dipping, but it was the bomb!  It's hard to stop eating it, but be for warned - do not fill yourself up on chips and dip because the entrees are huge.  I ordered the carne asada burrito wet with red sauce - OMG!  Ridiculous.  

The service was really good, they are extremely attentive to your every need.  I cannot wait to go back.

The prices - very reasonable

If you are in the mood for good Mexican food, I highly recommend Viva Mercados.
