Viva Mercado's please open soon. I have boasted about you for years and loved eating at your establishment. I have had many great trips, meals, and ultimately memories in Mexico and eating at Viva Mercado's brings them all back to me. I moved to the other side of town and kept looking for reasons to come to your side to eat. A while back some co-workers and I were nearby for training. I suggested Mercado's and we drove to your location. Upon arrival my stomach or heart was broken as I learned that you had closed down. 
Please know that it can only be a result of the economy because the food, atmosphere and service were great. 
I hope that you are able to re-open soon. i will keep checking to learn when you do.
