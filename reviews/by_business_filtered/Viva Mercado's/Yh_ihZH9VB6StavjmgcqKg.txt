Being a native Texan that has traveled to Mexico 10+ times, I was incredibly underwhelmed by this place. Overall I didn't try anything tasty here, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that I ordered the wrong things. I would mention my steak fajitas arrived in a gooey-soupy mess (with chicken fajitas in it mind you) that was unlike any fajita I've ever seen in Mexico. If I wanted soupy vegetables I would have ordered soup. 

It goes without saying this place isn't like the mexican places in TX, but sadly it's nothing like the places in mexico either.
