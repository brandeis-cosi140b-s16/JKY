Dear Robert,

Yes, your large party policy is a direct reflection of your customer service, since it affects your customers. I'm sorry too. My family and I have been regular customers for over a decade and will not be returning. There are simply too many other restaurants that put a higher priority on customer service, with equally as good food.
