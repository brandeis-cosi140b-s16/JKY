Great customer service. Our server made a mistake taking the order and was very friendly and quick to make it right. The friends who took us here are regulars and couldn't say enough good about it. 

As far as the food goes, very typical Mexi-American. Food came out hot and fresh. 

Not my typical long winded review, just don't gave a ton to say.
