Wow. This place is amazing. I got the cheese enchiladas lunch special. The red sauce was soooo flavorful. And the beans too. My dad got cow tongue tacos (he said they were delicious) they weren't on the menu in a taco form but he just asked and they said sure... That was nice of them!  My husband got the El Pastor tacos and I had a but and mmmm mmmm good!
  I'll be coming here again. My dad already comes here a ton... Apparently they make outstanding margaritas...
