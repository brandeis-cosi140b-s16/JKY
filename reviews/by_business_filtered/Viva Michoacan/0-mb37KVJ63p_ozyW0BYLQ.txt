Yet another Mexican restaurant my mother dragged me off to. I thought it would be nothing worth writing home about....

....But now I have found a Mexican restaurant I actually ENJOY, and not merely "like." 

This place is on Sunset, halfway up the hill, in the old building that once housed Carver's Steakhouse. It is a good-sized restaurant, and thanks to its large selection of seating you don't often find yourself waiting for a table. 

The food here is top-notch. Every Mexican place has chips and salsa, but this place has the best salsa on Earth. They have a strong assortment of chicken dishes, which seems to be something a lot of places have trouble doing. The Pollo Sarandeado and Pollo al Mojo de Ajo are to die far. Additionally, full entrees come with a cup of Fideo (noodle) soup, which is also excellent. 

My complaints are minor. First and foremost, a lot of the time (and this is not uncommon with Mexican dining), musicians are often wandering the building, playing loudly. They are talented, no question, but this does disrupt the ambience. Additionally, the staff sometimes seem to have trouble following directions (this could potentially be a language barrier issue.) Last time I got a lemon on my water even though I loudly and clearly asked for NO lemon. While this is merely annoying for me, it could be serious for someone with a citrus allergy.

Still, the good by far outweighs the bad. I have finally found a Mexican restaurant I actually enjoy going to. A firm recommendation for this place despite some minor flaws.
