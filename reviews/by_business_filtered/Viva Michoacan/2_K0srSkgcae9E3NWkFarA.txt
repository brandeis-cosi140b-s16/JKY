I went here for the first time a couple of days ago. I used to live at the apartments right down the street and still never came here until recently. I went with a friend and when we walked in, there was no one at the host stand. We waited about two minutes and a girl seated us. There was a small mariachi band playing at a table. That was pretty cool. There really weren't many people inside eating. There had to be 5 tables maximum. The busser came over and took our drink orders and got us chips, bean dip, and salsa. We both got horchata. That was some of the best horchata I've ever had. The salsa was so bomb. I ended up saving a bunch and pouring it all over my food. I ordered huevos rancheros because I was craving some breakfast food for dinner. My friend just watched me eat. Seriously though, the waitress didn't even walk over to our table and talk to us until at least 20 minutes after we were seated. The busser was running the whole show. He was all over the place refilling drinks and running food. Overall, the waitress sucked and the busser was awesome. Once my food arrived, I was a happy camper. The huevos rancheros were so good. With the salsa from the chips, that threw it over the top. I am totally a fan of this place. In the end, I tipped the waitress a dollar (my meal wasn't expensive anyway) and I handed the busser 10 bucks. He deserved it way more than she did. If you ever have time to just chill and you're in no rush what so ever, then come on over. I will definitely come back one of these days.
