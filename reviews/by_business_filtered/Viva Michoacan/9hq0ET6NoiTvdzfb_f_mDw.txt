i was born and raised in texas where mexican food is as good as it gets. ever since i moved to the vegas area, i have had a hard time finding good mexican food or even good hot sauce for that matter! viva michoacan reminds me of texas in so many good ways. the salsa, beans, chips, tortillas, and all of the entrees that i have tried are fantastic. i will continue to visit viva michoacan again and again and again!
