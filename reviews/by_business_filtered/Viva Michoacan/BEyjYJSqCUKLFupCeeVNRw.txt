I recently returned to this place after eating here several years ago. It has slipped a bit since I last visited. I ordered a beef burrito and beef taco. The beef in the burrito was strangely dry and seemed to have been overcooked - or perhaps it was cooked earlier and then warmed in a microwave. In any event, it was less than ideal. This was a disappointing visit, one I won't be repeating.
