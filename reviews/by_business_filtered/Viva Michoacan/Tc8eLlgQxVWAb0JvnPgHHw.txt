Meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

Walked in and were seated no problem. Place was pretty empty for a Friday night. Husband ordered a beer (they only have bottled beers) and a shot, I ordered a margarita. The waitress sounded quite annoyed when I asked her which flavors they had... I tried looking through the little flip book menu, but it was so filthy, it left a disgusting....greasy feeling on my fingertips.

The decor here is covered in dust. My husband pointed it out at first, and I didn't think of it.... I thought it was just part of the plant.. until I saw that some parts of it were "fuzzy" and other parts weren't...... Yum.

Their chips and salsa... I was not impressed with. I don't like re-fried beans anyways, and the other salsa just tastes like smoke. One dimensional. So, I asked for some Pico De gallo, expecting some flavor.

WRONG.

I used the lime from my margarita, along with salt and pepper. It made it edible.
Both of our dishes were lukewarm... not hot.

The fried ice cream came with some crappy fruit preserves on it, that tasted like it was old from a tin can.

The only saving grace in this place is the fideo soup...despite its unattractive color.
