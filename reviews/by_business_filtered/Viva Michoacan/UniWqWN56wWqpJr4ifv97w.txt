Tried the carnitas michoacan ($16).  It was good, but workmanlike in quality.  Not as good as its description.  Not a Rick Bayless type of dish.  Came with only 2 tortillas (4 would be great).  Enchiladas acceptable, as usual.
Service here always great.  Chips, beans, & salsa are excellent & drinks stay full.
Main complaint about VM is that it's overpriced compared to food quality, but still a good place if you don't mind the prices.
