I work a mile away and when I invite an employee to lunch and ask them to choose any place, 9 times out of 10, I'm told Viva!  Good news to me since I used to be a regular at Lindo's on the NW part of town. Some of the best chips/salsa here and excellent fideo to start. Hard to not order shrimp ceviche. And when it comes to the menu, what a HUGE selection and variety. I like unique dishes so I typically order Chipotle Lengua or when I want to keep it healthy, I get their cactus dish.  As for my employees, they say enchiladas all the way.  I say you can't go wrong!
