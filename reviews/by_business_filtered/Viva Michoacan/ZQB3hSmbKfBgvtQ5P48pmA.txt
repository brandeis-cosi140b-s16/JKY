We came here last night after our friends raved about it. Ummm yeah nothing to write home about. I ordered their "famous" carnitas. They were nice, but nothing special. They came with a teaspoon of guacamole which was tasty...just was not enough for even one taco. Tortillas were homemade and beans were good so that is why they got one star. They had a guitarist playing who was decent, so they get the other star for that. Otherwise it was too hot inside, food was average, margarita had zero tequilla and service was slow. We wont be back.
