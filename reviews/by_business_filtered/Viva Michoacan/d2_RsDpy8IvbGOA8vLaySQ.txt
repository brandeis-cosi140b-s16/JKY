I had dinner at Viva Michoacan or "the face" as we call it, about a month ago. Their chips and bean dip were good. The nopales appetizer was good enough, not exciting but not bad. The beef fajitas were really not that good. Service was great and the ambiance was nice, but I am not in a hurry to go back. I went because I have gotten a lot of recommendations from others in the area and I was not impressed. Maybe the fajitas were just not their specialty.
