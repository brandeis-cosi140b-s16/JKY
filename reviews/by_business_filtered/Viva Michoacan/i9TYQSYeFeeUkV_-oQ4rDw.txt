Well .... I have now been here twice in one week - amazing service, excellent food, nice/comfortable atmosphere and wonderful staff - this place is far and above Lindo Michoacán (which I also love but is often crowded and loud).  If you are interested, the grilled tilapia in garlic butter is a must and part of their lower calorie menu - it comes with grilled veges.  

The first time we were there, there was a three person serenade and the group was adorable and amazing. They sang my kids a song.  They sat us by the tortilla maker, making fresh tortillas.  Just like Lindo, they serve soup before the meal - I am imagining this must be a tradition in the Mexican state of Michoacán.  

Great for kids.   Great for a night out.  Not too crowded, but enough of a crowd to know it is good!!!!
