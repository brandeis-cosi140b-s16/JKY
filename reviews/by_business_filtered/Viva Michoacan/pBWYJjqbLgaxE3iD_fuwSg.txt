Arrived around 2:00 PM for a late lunch on a weekday. The place was not very busy. The service was not bad. I think the prices for lunch specials are not too bad (price includes a soft drink), but for regular menu I thought the prices seem quite high. I ordered a chicken burrito lunch special and was not impressed. The only thing that had any flavor on the plate was the rice. The beans were extremely bland, the shredded chicken in the burrito was plentiful but it was very dry, tough and flavorless. I almost had to ask for a knife to saw my way through it. No moisture at all. The sauce they used on the burrito tasted like watered down tomato soup. I had to douse the whole meal with the salsa - and the roasted style salsa is not my favorite. I thought the bean dip that came with the chips and salsa was fairly good. Well, it was healthier than many Mexican meals (according the the menu - no lard is ever used), but it seems at the expense of flavor.
