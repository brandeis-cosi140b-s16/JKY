Similar to the other Michoac√°n restaurants in the valley. IMO though it's not quite as good as Lindo on West Flamingo. The atmosphere is authentic enough but for some reason the food just misses the mark, even though it's suppose to be the same thing. I almost always get the Camarones Sarandeados....yum!
It's by work so I will still go if the mood for Mexican strikes.
