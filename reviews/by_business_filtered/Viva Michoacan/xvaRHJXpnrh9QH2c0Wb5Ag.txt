just an update b/c I have been back several times since my original review. We went on mother's day and they were having a sunday buffet. We ordered it b/c they had menudo and posole and rice pudding and they were all sitting nxt to ea. other. nice.. it was great. delic. rice pudding but you know its hard to keep all your food warm, esp. for a mexican food buffet. it was good just not everything was warm or fresh. (not their fault i guess). they do serve made to order quesadillas. we tried a nopal one - omg so good.  I stand firm their menudo is so far the best in town that i've tried (from pepe's tacos, roberto's, Los molcajetes, Sam;s Town buffet & the Orleans buffet) but orleans buffet and sam's town were both pretty damn good I gotta say. probably neck & neck witht his place.  I've come back several times for the menudo. I've also had the beef fajitas. really good. came to the table sizzling. I'd order it again but kinda pricy for the amt you get. It wasnt so much food you can share as in other restaurants when you order fajitas. I picked at it and it was almost gone. Wasnt worthg etting a to-go box. For this reason I probably wouldnt go there for dinner again just b/c of the $15.00 minimum for dinner plates. ahh..ehhh.. i can find cheaper for the same quality. but all in all. great food. best mexican food i've tried in town. oh and yes the fideo soup is awesome get that instead b/c i ordered a dinner salad with my plate and it had chopped onions .. chopped so finely you couldnt pick them out.
