The food was so bland and we were very disappointed in our food. We ordered the sandwich and it had barely any meet on it and no spice or flavor at all! This is a awful choice if you are vegetarian there are no options, I ordered vegetarian burrito and it was a flour tortilla with bland veggies and that's it! I was so bummed I had to spend my money! Oh! And the prices!!!! $12 for my veggie burrito! Never coming here again!
