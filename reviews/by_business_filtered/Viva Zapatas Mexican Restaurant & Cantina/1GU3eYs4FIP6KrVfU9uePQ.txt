My family ( husband, 3 kids under 12) came here from yelp recommendation.  First of all the service was absolutely amazing!   We got the guacamole and they make it table side! Food was very good. I got the shrimp enchiladas and they were very tasty.  I was already so full from the yummy soup and chips and dip that I had to take most of it to go!
