I don't really like Mexican food, but if that is what the day's food choice is, I'd pick Zapata's over any other Mexican restaurant in town!  The service here is always top notch, and since I work close by and have been here more times than I can count, it is a lot to say that the service has never let us down.

The food is top quality for Mexican food, from the shredded beef tacos to the enchiladas.  Nothing is ever served too salty or greasy, just perfect.  The lunch dishes come with a free drink, which is a great deal too!  

My favorite dish has to be 16 on the lunch menu.  I can't remember the name, but it is basically a couple of slices of juicy chicken breasts topped with a creamy sauce, with beans and rice on the side.  with this special, you get your choice of homemade corn or flour tortillas (I prefer the flour, but they are both good).  And if you look at the southwest corner of the restaurant, you can see your fresh tortillas being prepared right on the spot!  

Zapatas is a favorite in our community, and in Las Vegas in general.  I know people that come from across town to eat here.  It really is a top notch, affordable restaurant!
