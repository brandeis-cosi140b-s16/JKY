Love Zapatas!!! They have live music and amazing food. My husband is Hispanic and he said it almost matches his mom's cooking. The wait staff was very professional, and the people who come between the waiters are great you never have an empty drink. Love the complimentary bean dip/salsa and chips. My daughter is one and loves the music!
