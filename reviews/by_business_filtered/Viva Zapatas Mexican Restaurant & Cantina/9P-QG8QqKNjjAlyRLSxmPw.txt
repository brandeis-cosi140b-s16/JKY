Viva Margaritas! I ventured to this spot for Happy Hour with some co-wokers one Friday afternoon. We chose this place specifically for their HH drink specials...2 for 1 margaritas! Ay yai yai!! Annnd, they were actually tasty...not too much sweet and sour, just the right amount! Unfortunately there are no HH food special (tear). : ( 

Coming from San Diego, it has been difficult to find authentic Mexican food, but Viva Zapatas was one of the better ones I've found so far in Vegas. 
I ordered the taco plate with beans and rice. Unfortunately I can't recall the three different taco meats I ordered, but I remember all of them being tasty. The rice was prepared well, but my favorite were the refried beans and homemade chips they brought out when we sat down...yummy!!! Another traditional touch that I appreciated was the fideo soup that accompanied my meal. I could have slurped that soup all night....delicious!! 

The ambiance was enjoyable as well. Traditional colors and decor with classic Mexican tunes in the background. I believe the server mentioned that they have occasional live musical performances, so if that peaks your interest I would call prior to confirm. The service was good, nothing above and beyond, but certainly friendly. The only downside of this place is that it is fairly pricey for traditional Mexican food. Thank goodness for their HH margarita specials!
