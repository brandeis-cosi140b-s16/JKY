Loved this place! Found this place through yelp! Service was great, super clean and friendly. Not to mention, their food was Delicious! We ordered the steak cilantro, chile verde quesadilla and chicken burrito (enchilada style). Portion sizes are huge so try not to get full on the chips salsa and beans. :)
