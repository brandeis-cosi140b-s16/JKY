We're visiting from San Diego and read the reviews from previous customers and knew we had to try it. THIS PLACE DID NOT DISAPPOINT. The service was top notch and never let my drink get below half. The servers were very attentive and polite. The food was excellent very generous portions and very tasty. The chips, beans, and salsa was really good and so was the complimentary soup. Next time we're in Vegas again we will definitely stop in.
