This was an excellent new find for me!

A complimentary cup of Fideo Soup was a nice prelude to a veritable Mexican feast after downing also complimentary warm homemade Tortilla Chips in a mellow Bean Dip and spicy hot Red Salsa.  A made to order Guacamole Dip prepared tableside by our wiatress was excellent with a freshly opened avocado and just the right amount of lime, cilantro, and other seasoning.  White Onions, Jalapeno Peppers, and pieces of tomato enhanced this yummy dish.

Next up for me was a 17 Tecala Combination Plate, consisting of a suitably soft Chile Relleno and a fine Green Chile Pork & Bean Burrito, along with a Shredded Beef Taco prepared with a requested crunchy hard shell that was ordered ala carte.  The beef was a little soggy; otherwise everything was tasty.  To help fill the gut were included Refritos and Mexican Rice.  Diane enjoyed a large Shrimp Quesadilla executed with a Flour Tortilla, melted Cheddar Cheese, and cut up pieces of shrimp.  Our meal was accompanied by fine guitar music and singing.  Service was friendly, quick, and excellent all around.  Water glasses were repeatedly refilled without request.

4-1/2 stars overall!  I will surely be back!
