Sorry guys- I can't be one to give this place 4 or 5 stars. The restaurant decor is very cute and the service was great. The food was too heavy for me. I got a carne asada burrito and my boyfriend had the seafood cocktail campechana along with some tacos. He said the campechana was good. I thought my burrito had too much stuff in it and that was without the pico de gallo and beans. I am sticking to mi familia for quick and easy Mexican food.
