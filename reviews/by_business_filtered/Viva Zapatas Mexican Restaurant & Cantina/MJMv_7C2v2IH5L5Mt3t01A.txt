I've eaten here many times. It's proximity to home and work made it my go-to Mexican spot most of the time, but it's not my favorite spot, or favorite Mexican in Vegas. It's pretty good, a must try.

I'm not their biggest salsa fan, but it's spicy so I enjoy that. The table side guacamole is very good. The menu is large, items are  priced a bit higher than I prefer, but the portions are huge. I've enjoyed their quesadillas with shrimp, avocado shells stuffed with shrimp and pico, and most of all the fideo. Honestly, I always came for beer and fideo. I felt the fish and shrimp tacos were quite bland, and the burritos are packed with way too much meat and nothing else.

The service is always friendly. It gets very busy here, so beware of that. I have waited longer than I'd like to admit for food here. A decent spot, but not the best.
