First of all, I live in Henderson and come to this place when I am craving authentic Mexican food. In other words, I travel about 30 minutes and pass a lot of restaurants along the way. I have tried a few dishes that have been really good, but I think I have a favorite- the pork marinated in Coca-Cola. The pork is tender (not fatty), and is covered in a sauce that will make you slap your momma. Oh, did I mention there is a lady in the back making homemade tortillas? Please remember to tip this nice lady -- she is working hard back there. The staff is friendly and attentive , and there is a good chance you will catch live music while enjoying the best Mexican food in Las Vegas.
