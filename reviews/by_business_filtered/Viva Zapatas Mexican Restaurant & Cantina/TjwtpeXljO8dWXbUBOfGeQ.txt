OMG I LOVE THIS PLACE!! I end up eating here at least 3 or 4 times a month...if not for lunch then for dinner. This is authentic Mexican (made by real Mexicans - I'm just sayin). They have homemade tortillas which are delicious!! They always bring out fresh chips with salsa and bean dip and I suggest getting the guacamole as an appetizer. They make it tableside and you can choose how hot you want it (amount of jalapenos) as you can choose the amount of onions, tomatoes, and cilantro.

For lunch they have your typical "Order by Number" chart. I generally order the numero siete (that would be 7). It's a cheese enchilada and beef taco, although I usually sub the taco for a bean tostada. For dinner I usually get the shrimp ceviche which is BOMB!! The shrimp is cooked with the citrus juice and there are tomatoes, jalapenos, and onions, served with a fried corn tortilla (essentially a shrimp tostada I suppose).  It is quite tasty - especially if you top it with that guacamole.

They also serve traditional Mexican fare like menudo (beef stomach anyone?) and nopales (cactus).

HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I promise you will go again.
