My boyfriend and I went to Vegas and coming From a Mexican families down south of Texas.... as south as you can get, I was a little skeptical eating Mexican food here. We decided to take the risk and were impressed. The service was excellent and so fast! The food, although differently prepared, was delicious. I had never had enchiladas that were filled with shredded beef. My honey absolutely loved his food also. We were almost going to ask for someone to roll us out...that's how much we ate. I will admit that the sopapillas were a little thicker than what I'm used to but still very good. Definitely recommended!!
