I went with my family to enjoy good Mexican food. Well we dreamt of having good food. The food was terrible. I order Birria de Chivo and it was gross it tasted sour and the smell was rotten, the rice was hard and cold and it tasted 2 days old i did not eat at all. My hubby order the chile colorado and as soon as they asked how do u want your meat cooked i knew it was not going to be good. It sucked. Comida aqui no Sirve para nada. I do not recomend this place.
