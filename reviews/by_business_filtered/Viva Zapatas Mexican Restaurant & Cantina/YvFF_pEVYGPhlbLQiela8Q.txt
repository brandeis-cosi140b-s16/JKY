Move-over, Lindo Michoacan! These guys are legit! Ask for the guac dip, AMAZING! Love the decor, the Tia Maria making the hand made tortillas in the back, the music, the staff is wonderful. 

I love absolutely everything on their menu. I've tried almost everything. Green Chilaquiles, Carne Asada, Fideo Soup, yummmm....Everything is good.

I hate that to come here I have to drive 45 + minutes from Henderson. :-( If ever in the North side of town and in the mood for some good, authentic Mexican, try this place.


UPDATE REVIEW: 

After coming back a few times after writing my last review, I can't help to notice how much the quality of the food has gone down. 

As a faithful customer of this place, I can say it is NOT what it used to be. They are so busy, service is terrible. The food now lacks authenticity. Tastes like they cook everything on the same pan. 

Sad to see this place slowly start to slack and lose something so good...because they had it for a while. Hope things improve. I will not come back soon and spend $17 on a mediocre dish.

Step it up, Viva. Lindo Michoacan is starting to sound better than your place. :-/
