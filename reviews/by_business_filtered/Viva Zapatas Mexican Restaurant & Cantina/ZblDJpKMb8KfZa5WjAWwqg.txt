Husband and I were looking for a fiesta of flavors- this place was decent, however for the price it was a bit of a let down. The opening snacks of chips and salsa and refried beans were amazing and very addictive. Salsa had good flavor and spice. Then came the complimentary soup that comes with every entrée. This was pretty good as well- at most places it has an overly tomato taste, but it was more subdued here which I like. But nothing to run home and rave about- at the end of the day it's just a little broth with some noodles. Now to the main course:
Tacos de pescado- The fish was breaded and fried served in a flour tortilla. Just because something is fried doesn't mean it has to completely lack flavor. There was absolutely zero seasoning. I had to drench the tacos in the sauce that came on the side in order to get any flavor, and then all I ended up tasting in the end was the sauce.
Beef Fajitas- again the meat completely lacked flavor. We were looking for spice or something and just got overdone chewy pieces of steak. For a $17 entrée we were very disappointed. And the meat to pepper ratio was horrible. There was barely enough meat to make two tacos and the plate was piled high with so much filler- onions and bell peppers. 
Overall- these two dishes weren't home runs, but I can see that this place has the potential to produce delicious dishes however I probably will not be returning to find out.
