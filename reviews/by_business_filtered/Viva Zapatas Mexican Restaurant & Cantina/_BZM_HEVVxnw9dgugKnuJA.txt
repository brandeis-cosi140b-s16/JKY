First impression was nice.  The hostess was very friendly and professional. She greeted us and offered us a carrier for our babies car seat so that was a plus.  She sat us down and not to long after we had our waiter take our drinks. They handed us chips and salsa right away. We placed our order and munched on the chips and salsa which was pretty yummy.  But the wait just to get our food was pretty lengthy. We ended up getting full off of the food because of the wait. So when our food finally came it was nice and hot.  I ordered the steak enchilada mole. One bite and it was so overly stuffed with cheese.  Almost to the point where it made me sick. I could bearly taste the mole.  I Know that I will never ordered this again. I also had the Carne asada salad. It was overpowered with lime. It had no flavor. Another thing I will not order again.  My son had the steak cognac.  I took a bite and it was good they cooked it med rare perfect. My husband had the shrimp and it was cooked just right also and there was good flavor.  If it was based off service alone I would put another star.  Maybe I'll come back and try a different item but so far I was not impressed with my food.
