In Love again!
I asked around for a good romantic place to take a date. The name Viva Zapata's kept coming up by friends recommending it. The name didn't sound very romantic, it sounded more revolutionary, but maybe that's what I needed some kind of revolution in my life since nothing else was working out, So I decided to give it a try.
  We agreed to meet there at eight, but I got there at seven, I didn't want to be late  and I wanted to get a feel of the place and make sure it met my expectations. As i walked in i knew i would like the place, nice decor dim lighting and live music. I proceeded to the bar and ordered a margarita and listened to the guitar man play someone Else's life with his fingers.  it was a really good margarita it actually had tequila in it. The bartender brought some complimentary chips and salsa and some bean dip. I didn't want to start eating since my date hadn't arrived yet, but one chip loaded with bean dip wouldn't hurt. After two bowls of chips and bean dip and three margaritas I decided to order an appetizer, Something light, so I ordered the seviche and let me tell you, it was the best seviche I have tried this far from the ocean, it couldn't be any fresher or tastier. It was soo good I decided to stick with the mariscos (seafood) and ordered the camarones borrachos, (like me)  Shrimp sauteed with garlic, spices and tequila, the perfect combination. You just can't go wrong with that, It was out of this world goodness!
 All in all I had a wonderful time.  When you get caught between great food, a nice romantic ambiance and a guitar, you can't help  It but to fall in love. ....My date? Didn't make it.....But I fell in love nonetheless..... with the food at Viva Zapata's.
