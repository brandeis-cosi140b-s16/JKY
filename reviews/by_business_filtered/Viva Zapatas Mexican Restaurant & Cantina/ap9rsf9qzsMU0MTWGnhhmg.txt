Good food. I like to take a friend who knows Mexican food and he orders for me. Service from the drink servers is better than the waiter. One was so excellent I contributed to him directly. When I went alone with the kids, my waiter looked like he had no patience for us. We do not speak Spanish and he treated us like outsiders. I needed help with the menu because it is dark in there and it is hard to read. He was no place around to help. When the waiter finally did come around, he still acted like we were bothering him. So I suggest to take a Spanish speaking person with you when you go. It is too bad for the waiter but the food is good. The prices are on the high side. Minimum $10 for appetizers dinner plates run $15 to $30 a plate.
