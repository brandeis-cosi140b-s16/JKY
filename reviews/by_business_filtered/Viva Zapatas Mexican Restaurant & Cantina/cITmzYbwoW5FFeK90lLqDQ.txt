The service here was amazing. They have Mexican beers on draft that most places don't. I loved their chips and salsa, they brought a cup of fideo before my entree, which was delicious. I had the shrimp tacos which were very good. They sometimes have live music, so it's a nice atmosphere. If it wasn't on the other side of town I would definitely come here more.
