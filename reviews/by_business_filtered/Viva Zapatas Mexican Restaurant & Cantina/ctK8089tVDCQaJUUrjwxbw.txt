What a great restaurant, fresh tortillas being made daily. This place has a good menu for seafood that makes it a great spot to visit. Prices for dinner are good, but you have to check out their lunch menu, incredible deal. Overall, the best part is the waiters in the restaurant, incredible service and you can bet on never having to wait for drink refills.
