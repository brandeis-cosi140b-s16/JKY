Being a truck driver I have tried a lot of different across the country this is one of the best finds I have found being a close walk from the truck stop had the beef fajitas this trip through the beef and peppers were seasoned perfectly very generous on that part could use a little more of the beans and rice that is really the only thing it lacked on with the fresh chips and tortillas service was quick and friendly will definitely be back when I come to las vegas
