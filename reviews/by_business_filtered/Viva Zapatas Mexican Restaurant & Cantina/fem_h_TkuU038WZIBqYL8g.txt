The beans.... Oh the beans! And they're complimentary. Along with the Fideo soup. Oh, man! I would eat just that, it makes me so nostalgic for meals from my past.  With that said, everything we have tried has been very good. We have been here a few times and have not been disappointed. The parking lot is a hot mess and the seating area is small but once you sit down and they bring the complimentary beans, salsa, chips and soup I am already so happy that I end up ordering a small meal to share with someone! So if you want to get off the strip and have a good, more authentic Mexican meal head over to Viva Zapatas!
