Been here twice and really enjoyed it both times, this time our server wasn't as attentive as we would have liked but it still wasn't bad.  All the food was great with the exception of the Monetary Jack queso 'dip'...there is NO dipping about this at all it was a pile of grease with some melted cheese in the middle.  I have had queso at many mexican restaurants and I love it this is something I would never eat again:(
