Found this place about 6 months ago,  and this has become the only place we go for Mexican food.   In a  time of  franchise dominance, this place gives a genuine local flavor.

I've had various stuff  there, and not a bad meal yet.  Tacos, fajitas,  enchiladas,  and even the Steak Ala Mexicana.. you can't go wrong  with any.
