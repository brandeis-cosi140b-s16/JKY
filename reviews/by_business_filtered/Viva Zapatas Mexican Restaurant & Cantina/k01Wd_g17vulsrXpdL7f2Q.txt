Went there on recommendation from yelp, was not disappointed. We went early evening so the place was not full yet, but had quite a few tables taken. We were seated quickly and the waiter appeared almost immediately. Drinks came out quickly and the waiter waited until we had decided on dinner before approaching us for our order, a refreshing change from the usual hovering around and rushed feeling. The meal was outstanding, just enough spice heat to enhance the flavor not overpower it. Some might want  more heat, but for me this was just right. The table was cleared AFTER we finished each course by very attentive wait assistants, nice touch to wait, not hover. Overall service was great and food was outstanding,  Only have one downside, the lighting is dim and makes reading the menu challenging. The print on some parts of the menu is the same color as the lighting, so there is no contrast. Those of us who have a little trouble seeing in dim light might want to bring a small light. I would still  highly recommend VIVA ZAPATAS.
