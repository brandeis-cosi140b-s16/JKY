The food was delish! The Atmosphere was great! The bar stools were horrendous, they killed our backs! Won't be sitting at the bar waiting for our table = Lost bar revenue!
They need additional parking, circled their inadequate,  small parking lot for 20 minutes,  1 handicapped spot! Great food, but not worth the trouble.
