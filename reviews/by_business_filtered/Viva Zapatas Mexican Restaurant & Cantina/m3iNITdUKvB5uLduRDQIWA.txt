Mexican food is a love it or hate it outcome.  You have no choice but to LOVE absolutely everything about this place. Staff and service are excellence, very nice, polite, fast, just amazing! Everything we have ordered here has been so delicious! The guacamole is made in front of you and the chips and salsa also come with a bean dip that is great and I don't even like beans! The live music is fun and entertaining and not overwhelming. They have fresh homemade lemonade that is so refreshing. So clean and well taken care of. This place would get 6 stars if it was an option!
