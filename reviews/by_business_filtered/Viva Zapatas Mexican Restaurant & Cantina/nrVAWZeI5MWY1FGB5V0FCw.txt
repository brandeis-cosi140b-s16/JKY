What I liked: The food. The tortilla chips were amazing, bean dip rocked (I inhaled it), shrimp ceviche (although since the shrimp was cooked, it's not ceviche) and the tamales. The service was very attentive, especially to make sure my iced tea was filled. Food came out rather quick, too, which was nice.

What I didn't like: Not having a tamale specific option. I had to order them a la carte or with an option I didn't want. I also didn't like the condition of the menus. When a restaurant's (large) pages stick together, I want hand sanitizer provided. There's no reason for them to stick together if you would wipe them down daily.

The food was just too good so it gets 4 stars.
