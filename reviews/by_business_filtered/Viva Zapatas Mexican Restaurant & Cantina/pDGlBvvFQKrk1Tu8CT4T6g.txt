Went here during a recent trip to Vegas, but forgot to write the review.  I want to make sure to give this business its due.
This is not an area I typically visit while in town. My usual hotel wasn't able to accommodate my third night (a busy Friday) and I wound up choosing a place that had great reviews. That decision was a good one, and I followed it up by trying out Viva Zapatas due to its following on Yelp.
First the bad - parking. Located adjacent to a busy service station, the parking is extremely limited. I actually waited several minutes while two people were talking outside their respective cars. I am glad I had the patience.
The title should be reversed; it's a cantina & restaurant. The vibe, even on a weekday lunch, is lively, especially with the sporting events on the TVs. I actually sat at the bar -- there was a short wait for tables. But my server was quick, friendly and efficient. It took a while to get through the menu; I love tough choices. 
I wound up choosing the Ayoxustla combo (chile relleno & beef taco) and enjoyed everything. It was tasty, filling and the service was excellent. 
I'll come back again. It's worth the extra few minutes to enjoy a really good meal.
