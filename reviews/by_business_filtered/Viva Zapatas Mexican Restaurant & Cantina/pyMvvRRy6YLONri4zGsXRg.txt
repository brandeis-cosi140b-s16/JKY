by far the best Mexican food I've eaten in a long time and I'm from the bay. I just moved to vegas and since we already ate here last time, I had the chicken mole which was amazing. The chicken was so tender and the mole sauce was perfectly seasoned. Tonight I tried the Camarones with the mushroom wine sauce which was on point. The prawns are huge from Mexico. Their chips and salsa are also delicious. I also love how attentive they are and how there is a guy singing and playing mexican music. Makes you feel like your in mexico. If you ever come to vegas,  Def try this place! You won't be disappointed!
