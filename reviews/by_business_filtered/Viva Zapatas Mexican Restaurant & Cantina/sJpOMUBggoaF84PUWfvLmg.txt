Right off the Craig Rd. exit on the 15 North is a great little Mexican restaurant called Viva Zapatas. It's a relatively small spot that you would probably miss if you weren't looking for it. The food is excellent, but the parking is tight. Zapatas makes for a great lunch spot or a great dinner place to wow your out of town guests. The restaurant has a cozy atmosphere and features a cool bar in the center of the restaurant with a couple of over head tv screens so you won't miss the big game. You can find a picture or two of Emilliano Zapata hanging on the walls along with a few other eclectic Mexican artifacts. The food is excellent! They start you off with chips, salsa, and beans. This place reminds me of a great Mexican restaurant that is no more called Sal's Mexican Inn in Oxnard,Ca. Go with a combination plate, no need for an appetizer because the portions are good. I like the #4 combo which is a pork burrito, chicken enchilada, chicken taco, and rice and beans. I like to substitute the chicken taco for a chorizo taco. I'm not sure if the chorizo taco is even on the menu, but don't leave without one. They are excellent. The pork burrito is so tasty and the chicken enchilada pops off your plate and into your mouth. The enchilada is smothered in cheese just how I like it. Be sure to order the guacamole and watch them come over to your table and make it fresh in front of your eyes. The guacamole is first class. Zapatas also has a killer chile relleno. On the way out don't leave without what I call the best after dinner mints in town-undisputed. These little green babies aren't so minty, but more lemon limey. They will leave a refreshing taste in your mouth for the ride home. The bottom line is no matter what you order at Viva Zapatas you won't be disappointed, so if you're in Northtown you have to drop by.
