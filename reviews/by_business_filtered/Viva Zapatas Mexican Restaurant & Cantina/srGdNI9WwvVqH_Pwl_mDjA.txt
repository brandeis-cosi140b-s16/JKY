Holy Frijole, is this place good.  Las Vegans usually place Lindo Michoacan at the top of the heap when it comes to Mexican dining, but my erudite palate says Zapata's is easily just as as good, and much more affordable.

I really cannot say enough good things about this cozy little joint.  It's as authentic as it gets, and the food here is so good I don't have a go-to plate.  I always spend a good deal of time browsing the generous menu to pick something new, and it has always been delicious.  The chips and salsa are homemade, and probably laced with something illegal because it's hard to put them down.  The complementary fideo soup with an entree is a really nice touch and quite delicious.  There's a lot of complex flavors going on in what usually is just noodles and broth.

As far as the entrees go, I've never had anything that wasn't just firing on all cylinders.  Most recently I had the Camarones Borrachos entree, which was shrimp cooked in tequila, and it was absolutely delicious.  Before that I had one of the carnitas dishes and it gave me a glorious food comma.  The margaritas are also some of the best around.

My only criticism of Zapata's is the parking situation.  It's a small, crowded lot and we often have to park at the gas station next to it, but it's a minor inconvenience compared to the quality of the food awaiting inside.  Highly, highly recommended.
