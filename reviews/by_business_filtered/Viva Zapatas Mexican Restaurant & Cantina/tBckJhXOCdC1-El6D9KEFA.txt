Yes,  Viva! Zapata's is right.  I have been to this place 4 times so far.  I live in California otherwise I would be there every week.  The food is incredible.  Authentic mexican food, with tons of flavor!  The service is superb.  Chips and salsa are on point.  They also bring you bean dip and fideo as a starter. Order the guacamole, they make it table side from scratch.  Real avocados, jalapenos, lime, garlic, cilantro, etc.  It is soo tasty.  I have been for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Everything I have eaten from seafood to machaca has been great.  I will go there everytime I visit Las Vegas. You should try this place as a good alternative away from the strip and alot more economical.

P.S.  Homemade tortillas!!  That's reason enough to visit this place!
