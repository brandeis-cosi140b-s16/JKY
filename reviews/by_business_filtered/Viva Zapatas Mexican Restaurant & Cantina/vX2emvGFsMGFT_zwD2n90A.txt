Great food! Chips were good but slightly greasy. Bean dip amazing!! My husband practically ate the whole thing!! Very generous serving. I ordered the Zapata Burrito and it was ginormous!! Honestly you could share it with another person or two. I only ate a quarter of it and was stuffed. Definitely would go back if I was in the area!!
