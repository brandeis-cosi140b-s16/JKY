We have been coming here for over 8 years. We totally love this place. The d√©cor is part bar part Mexican. My kids love the bean dip (given at the beginning with chips and a very spicy salsa) and the fideo that comes with most meals it very tasty.  We haven't had anything that we didn't like. My kids also love it in the evenings (especially weekends) when there is a guy there who plays the guitar or electric piano. We always have a few extra one dollar bills for the kids to go give the performer. Fun for all!!!
