We like Zapatas very much. I've eaten there about 50 times. It is good Mexican food for a reasonable price. All of the food is good and Dinners come with soup. Lunch menu is available until 5pm and save you a couple bucks but without soup. Happy hour goes til 6pm, and they have a few drink specials. Dinner is nice because they have live music. Good atmosphere. Actually would like to give it a 4.5 stars and think that it is one of the best mexican restaurants in Las Vegas and one of the best restaurants overall in the North East part of the City!
