This place is amazing! We happened to find it when we were staying just a few blocks away for Electric Daisy Carnival & immediately fell in love! 
The food is delicious, large portions, authentic Mexican food, & friendly/attentive staff!  The chili rellenos are incredible, the cilantro steak was the best cilantro dish I've ever had & the drinks are cheap. The prices here are very reasonable (we had drinks, an appetizer, and two entrees for $50). We were in Vegas for 4 days & visited Viva Zapatas twice, we will be back next summer & intend to visit this place again.  Also, the decor is very tasteful and interesting to look at & avoids the cheesiness that many restaurants get into. The thing we liked the most about this place is that it's a bit out of the way but they really focus on a comfortable, friendly atmosphere, which you don't really find on the strip.
