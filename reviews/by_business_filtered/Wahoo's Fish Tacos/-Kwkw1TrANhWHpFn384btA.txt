As a So Cal native, I was super excited to see that Wahoos came to Vegas. But we just left pretty disappointed. The service was terrible! We walked in and we were literally the only people in there. Still we waited almost 20 minutes for our food to come out. The food was ok.. One of them was supposed to have teriyaki but it was pretty bland so we asked for more sauce and we were charged for it. The whole experience was pretty lame and I doubt we'll be going back.
