It felt late after a long flight and we needed something to eat. Wahoo's was recommended so that's where the four of us went. At first it was overwhelming so many options with lots of different combinations. 

The tacos were really pretty tasty. Fish tacos with the slaw was really good. Fish was moist and meaty, able to stand up to the toppings, but at the same time, it was light and refreshing. 

The Cajun beans were spicy, but not great, soft and mushy. The rice was also kinda soft and lacking architecture to hold the beans and the combo meal together.

The prices are good and the servings were super large. The place was cute, but a little messy at the end of the day (understandable). It also seems like the kind of place that could get super busy and hectic.
