Eating at Wahoo's definitely reminds me of college days in San Diego :)

I grew up in SoCal, and embarrassingly had never eaten at Wahoo's....I mean, it's a chain fish taco place, how could it be any better than El Pescador or The Best Fish Tacos in Ensada? Well, okay, it's not.... BUT it's darn good for a grilled fresh fish taco and considering I'm in the middle of the desert, that's pretty awesome!  

I have a hard time deciding between the original style vs. the citrus slaw bc both are equally yummy in my opinion: the citrus slaw is fresh and compliments the fish well, but the green sauce is soooo good!  I always just end up ordering one of each! Problem solved!

The decor here is casual surfer/skater hangout, and they're always playing chill rock/alt that reminds me of carefree high school days in the sun. The bar always has at least 2-3 people there (even in the early weekday afternoon!), and I can only imagine it being more popular after work lets out. 

I live so close to Boca Park, I'll be back often!! Kowabunga dude!

PS- free wifi!
