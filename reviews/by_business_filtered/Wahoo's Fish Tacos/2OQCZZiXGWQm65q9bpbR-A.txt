VERY good!  The food is SO tasty!  It's a wee bit pricey, but YUM!  Think Chipotle or Qdoba and kick it up a notch.  The food quality is HIGH; you get what you pay for, but $30 for lunch for two with no drinks is a little much for a daily driver.  But I will go back.  Delish!  Get the cajun fish bowl.  OMG!
