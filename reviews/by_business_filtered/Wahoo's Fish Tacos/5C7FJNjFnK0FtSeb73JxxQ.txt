Here's a Local bar with a revolving door for its staff.   Hard to get to know anybody except the owner, Paul, who will fire his employees unceremoniously without any warning.  (YELP).  
Beautiful patio and great food- but everybody is a stranger no matter how many times you've been there.  
Never had bad food, but I'm tired of the rotating staff.   For a "local's bar", there is nothing friendly and warm about the CONSTANT turnover.  
This used to be the coolest place in Boca Park, but now it's just flaccid with no warmth or personality.  
A single bad YELP review should not be grounds for immediate termination, if you had a little loyalty to your staff, they might have some for you. 

Paul, if you want to talk to me about your bad situation there, call me-- I'll be happy to give you the info you're overlooking.
 
You've done lost the support of the locals.
