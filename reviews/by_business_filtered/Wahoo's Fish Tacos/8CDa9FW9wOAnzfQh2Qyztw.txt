This location is vastly superior to the one in Spring Valley.  The food was prepared wonderfully, the portion size was great, and the food was a good value.  Kyrie who was tending the bar was a joy to be around.  She was funny, interacted with the clients, and was everything you look for in a bartender.  We'll probably come back just to see her.
