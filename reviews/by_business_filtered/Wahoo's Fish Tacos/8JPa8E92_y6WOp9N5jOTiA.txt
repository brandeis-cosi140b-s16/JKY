Special today:2 tacos and a Pacifico for $9. 
I got the shrimp and carne asada with a side of fries and hubs got 2 carne asada with a side of white rice and Cajun beans. He said mix the rice and beans and it's really good. I thought the shrimp taco was really good. It went well with the slaw mixture they put on the tacos. 
The Pacifico was COLD!!! And it's a good price for a 16 ounce. 
I only gave 4 stars because the regular menu is a bit pricey for tacos. 
Hubs was happy so we will be back for another visit. I think next time I'll try an enchilada.
