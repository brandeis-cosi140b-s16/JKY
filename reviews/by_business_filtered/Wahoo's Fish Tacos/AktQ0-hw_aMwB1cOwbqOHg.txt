My colleagues and I had a working lunch Thursday, June 3rd at 12:30pm at the Wahoos on Horizon Ridge and the service was terrible.  One colleague got the wrong order. Another colleague waited 40 minutes for her chicken enchilada, while other tables that came in after us were served that dish. The employees were unhelpful. We were told they were waiting 5 minutes for fresh chicken then when asked again they said it would be another 8 minutes. My colleague ended up asking for a refund and left because she never got her food. She was offered no apology and the stafff was apathetic. Needless to say, I would not return to this restaurant.
