1st of all, I consider this a hidden gem around boca park. Its not your typical taco shop but more of a up scale type. I tried the Kelua pork bowl with brown rice and man! Its bomb!!! I expected it to literally be in a bowl but it was served in a big plate with some veggies and beans. I can't wait to try other dishes but so far, it is very very tasty. 
2nd of all, alot of parking stalls so it is not a problem. One thing to keep in mind is the lunch rush hour, we arrive around 12pm and a line greeted us. It did not take long though a good 10 min wait, but the great part of it. A big menu is facing your direction so you would not notice the time while reading other dishes. 
Lastly, I love the decorations focused more in a Hawaiian theme well it gives right. Wahoo Fish Taco, you will find many brands around the area. From a signed surf board to snowboard.
