Love the decor, very beachy and fun. I tried 2 different tacos (carnitas and fish)
and they were good but not great. I've only been once to this Boca Park location and will return to try some other menu items. 
I didn't spend time at the bar, but it looked nice and they have great drink specials, such as $2 Pacifico.
