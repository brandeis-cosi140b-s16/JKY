Things I love:

Tacos
Taco Salads
Grilled fish
Carne asada
Delicious Mexi food in general

Places that have all of the above for a very affordable price:

Wahoo's

Nuff said? No. Believe me, there's more to say. I just moved to this side of town and am SO EXCITED that there's a Wahoo's near me.  Their Chicken Tortilla soup is SO legit.

I stopped in last night about 30 minutes before they closed and was so sad that they had closed a little early because it was so dead (first week of school I guess).  BUT THEN, the owner (or maybe manager?) saw how sad my face was and he opened back up for us!! WHAT?!??! Awesome customer service.  

Oh - and they have a fully stocked bar too.  I don't usually drink when I'm getting casual Mexi, but I think I may have to change that - they have about every kind of liquor you can imagine (and every flavor of Vodka you can think of).  

Like Arnold says, "I'll be back!"
