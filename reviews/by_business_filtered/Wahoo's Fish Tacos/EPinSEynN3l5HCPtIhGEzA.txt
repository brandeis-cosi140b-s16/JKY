I moved to Vegas from California, so I was pretty familiar with Wahoo's already.
I can say that a Wahoo's with a bar/gaming area is even better!

As far as the food, it's always really on point. I almost always get a salad every time. They are super fresh, full packed, and their dressings are not only delicious, but healthy as well. I love their new Kai Kale salad. They've done a great job adding the kale and masking the bitterness of it by chopping the kale into smaller pieces and mixing it in with other greens. It's such a simple idea, but no one is doing this. If you love salad, do yourself a favor and order one of theirs. Their tofu is also really really good. I don't know if it's marinated overnight or what, but it's super flavorful. 

As far as the bar service, it can be super hit or miss. We've had some amazing bartenders here, and then some that are not so good. Michael (I think that's his name...he has a New York accent) is an amazing bartender. He's helpful with his suggestions, super super friendly, always smiling, and very attentive. The rest of the bartenders here could take a couple notes from this guy.

Unfortunately, since this place is always packed with industry regulars you might end up getting ignored for awhile because of bartender favoritism.
