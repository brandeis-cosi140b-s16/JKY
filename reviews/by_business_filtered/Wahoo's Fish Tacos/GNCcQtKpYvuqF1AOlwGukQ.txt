Being that I'm from where the original location was I'm probably being very critical. Have eaten here several times. Most times is pretty good although I have gotten the fish tacos a little dry. But, that's what hot sauce is for. I'm told they are going to start staying open 24 hours which is cool. Outside bar that can be a cool little hangout at night. I would give more stars but... I'll leave that for the original location.
