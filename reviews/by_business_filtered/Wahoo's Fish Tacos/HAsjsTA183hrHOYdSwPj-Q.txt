This place is OK.  I came here with my wife late one night and it seemed like an average joint.  I've heard Wahoo's talked up so much, I was actually a bit disappointed.

I'll give them the fact that it was getting late in the night, but the girl who was cleaning and taking our orders at the same time seemed a little annoyed that we were here to eat.

The food was OK as well.  I wasn't impressed with the chicken breast tacos (got one grilled and one Cajun).  It is hard to compare to the awesomeness of a Roberto's Chicken Taco.

The rice and beans were OK as well.  Nothing to write home about.

It was rather loud and the fact that it has a bar in the restaurant made for some unneeded distractions when trying to sit down and have a meal.  I wouldn't take my kids here, that's for sure.

If you haven't been here yourself, go ahead and give it a try.  Otherwise, I would suggest going to a Roberto's for some Mexican food.
