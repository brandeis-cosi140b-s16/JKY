Well... it was okay. I definitely had higher expectations for this place, but I'm not exactly sure why. Wahoo's is super cute, very clean and everyone was extremely friendly. I enjoyed the surf/skate motif and found it really visually appealing. I wasn't quite sure what to order, but I ended up with a shrimp soft taco and a Cajun grilled fish enchillada. It totaled just under $7. You basically place your order at the bar and then they give you a number placard and they'll bring it out to you. Self seating. 

The restaurant was pretty empty, but it did seem to take awhile for the food to finally come out. It was good, very spicy and flavorful, but not very filling at all. The taco had a LOT of cabbage on it and was really small and difficult to pick up. I gave up trying and just ate it with a knife and fork. The enchillada was pretty good, but again on the small side.

I guess Wahoo's is fine if you are craving Mexican and seafood in a nice atmosphere, but I just felt a little let down. I think I could have had a more satisfying meal elsewhere for the same amount.
