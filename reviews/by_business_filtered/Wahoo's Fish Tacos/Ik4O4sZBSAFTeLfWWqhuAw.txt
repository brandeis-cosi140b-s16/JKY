Wahoo is more than the name of this place, it's the sound you make when you're here. 
I discovered wahoos in Cali and was so stoked that there was one so close to my job. It's not exactly hiding, but it's just in a location that very easy to not notice, at least for me, but now I always see it
What I love about wahoos is the atmosphere. When I come for lunch it's a nice quiet restaurant, when I come for happy hour it's a raucous bar that happens to serve really good food. They have tons of drink specials from $2 pacificos, $6 patron and tons of nfl specials. The bartenders are always cool and good conversation even when it gets super busy
The food is well above average, as everything is build your own so you can get fish or shrimp on anything.im always there for a reef burrito and I throw fish on it. 

TL;DR
a very good environment reminiscent of SoCal with good Mexican food and cheap alcohol
