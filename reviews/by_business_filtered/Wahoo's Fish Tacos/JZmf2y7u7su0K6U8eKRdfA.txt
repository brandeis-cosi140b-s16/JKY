Hadn't been here before, despite having locations in both Cali and Texas, when I've lived in both.
Another review, for another location, mentioned how healthy, tasty, and low-cal the shrimp burritos are here, and that is what I came for.

Ordered to go. Loved the beachy atmosphere with the tiki bar area, projected surfing/ocean scenes, and chill music. This is easily a place I could hang out for a while.

Service was friendly. Waited for my order at the bar, where I was asked for my ID even though I was just waiting. Bartendress was super sweet and apologetic about it.

Got the classic shrimp burrito, total was under $7 but it's not a burrito that is a meal on it's own (for my massive appetite). Flavors were good and fresh, simple shrimp in a teriyaki-like sauce with a bit of kick to it. Cabbage slaw, cheese, and very little else kept things fresh and healthy: no rice and beans in here!
Noticed they also had signage up that they'd recently added salmon to the menu- asked what cost would be for a salmon burrito on my next visit, and price was still under $7. Not bad at all!

Very pleasantly surprised by food quality, pricing, interior decor, and service here.

Side note: Gave an extra star for their transparency with nutrition info. Their website has an easily-found PDF file, their store has a printout, containing every dish offered here, with all meat combinations and condiments, with calorie listings and other data for health-conscious diners! Every place should offer this!
