Wahoo's Fish Taco is my default place to eat when we can't decide on anything better. So, in my family, I eat Wahoo's A LOT! As a matter of fact, I should get tested for too much exposure to Mecury at this point. Do I ever crave Wahoo's? Never. But I never mind eating it anytime of the day. 

The only addictive item at Wahoo's for me is Mr. Lee's sauce. I put that on everything. It costs $1 as a side, which is STEEEP considering the cheap menu. A little known secret is that you should ask them to put that in your burritos, taquitos, enchiladas etc for FREE!
