5 STARS for their great food, great service and professionalism of each employee and the beach blonde, board short wearin', slipper floppin' owner who was very attentive to his consumers, but..
Being that I am a part-time beach bum, I love Wahoos.. In Cali.  Their healthier portions go hand in hand with fresh air, salty beach water and sand between your toes.  But to have a Wahoos in Vegas!?  In the freakin' 125 degree desert where the lifestyle is chicken wings and beer at 3 o'clock in the morn just doesn't fly.  The venue surrounds its customers with surf boards, wake boards, skate boards and snow boards.. And then I walk out and i'm still in the epicenter of bone dry desert heat.  Wahoos is just playin' tricks on me.  Also, the building is just way.. too.. big.. with a back bar included.  Vegas already has Hooter's, Friday's and every dive bar known to mankind within a miles radius to take care of our alcoholism.  My suggestion?  If you are going to serve healthy and fresh, take away the bar.  Also, shrink the place down just a tad and make it more convenient like a Subways or Chipotle and smack your piece of Real Estate next some gym or inside a food court.  I don't know.. Just my 2 cents.
