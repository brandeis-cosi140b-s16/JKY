I used to like this place but wow,  it's gone down so bad. I've given it a few tries before writing this place off but now I'm done here. It's empty and I know why. When we walk in we're greeted by a guy who looks like he's hungover from the night before and could care less about having a job. Anyways 22 minutes pass by before getting our food in this empty place. As the server comes out everyone in the kitchen is looking or way and it just seems...awkward. the food was ok, I felt weird eating it. As I was going to get more water I look into my cup and it's filthy inside it. What in the world was I drinking?  This place has poor customer service and is filthy and I will never return again.
