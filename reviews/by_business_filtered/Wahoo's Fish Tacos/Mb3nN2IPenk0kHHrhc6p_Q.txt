If you're looking for something on par with Chipotle, this is a good option as the food is fresh and the prices are great.  The classic burrito ($5) is a flour tortilla filled with lettuce, cheese, salsa and the protein of your choice.  I thought the carne asada was nicely flavored.  I've had their burritos served wet with green/red sauce and cheese, which is also a tasty option.  My husband didn't think the shrimp and fish tacos were anything special.  On the night we went, the restaurant was uncomfortably warm, it was actually hotter in the restaurant than outside, and this does not bode well for the summer months!
