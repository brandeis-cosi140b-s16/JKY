Went into Wahoo s Friday April 26 2013 It was crowded as usual However service is terrible They have gotten rid of all servers in the bar area you have to go to the bar to order everything they have changed the pork sliders (not as good ) I don t know why things needed to be changed (mayb e to save  money on overhead) terrible choice from management
