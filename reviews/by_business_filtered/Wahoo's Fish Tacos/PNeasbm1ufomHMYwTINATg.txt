Love the food and coronaritas but I HATE the outside service. Christy is the absolute worst server. She never comes outside to check so you have to go up to the bar and ask repeatedly for service. Even if you ask for a separate tab, it does not always happen so be prepared. Other than that, it is a really fun place that is worth coming to. Sitting outside is also nice but I would highly recommend to that they find a new server or up their staff especially on weekends.
