So I had a crappy experience at Three Angry Wives and when I left I went to Wahoos, when I got there I was greeted by 2 great Bartenders, Floody and Bree! Very friendly made me feel at home, and just some of the BEST SERVICE I've had in awhile!! Definitely will go back, I think this company has 2 really great assets!
