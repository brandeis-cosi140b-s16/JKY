I was excited to hear a Wahoo 's had opened. In Las Vegas!  I ordered a combo plate with chicken enchilada, fish taco, brown rice and black beans.  The enchilada would have been good, had it been hot, but the cheese was barely melted. The taco was nothing but a big lump of fish.  It was not seasoned and bland.  I would have liked it to have been cut in small pieces with seasoning.  Best part was the black beans.. I will possibly try it one more time, but will skip Wahoo's if it is not better.
