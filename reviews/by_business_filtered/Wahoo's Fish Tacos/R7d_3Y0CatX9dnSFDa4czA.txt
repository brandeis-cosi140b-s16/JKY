Have gone twice now and both times my wife's tacos were cold!!! First time she ordered carne asada and what is supposed to be fresh cooked sure looked per-packaged and as i said before the meat was cold. we sent it back and it was back so fast I don't think they even had time to close the microwave door. The second trip she decided to try the fish tacos and first bite in the fish is cold. how tough is it to send out hot food
