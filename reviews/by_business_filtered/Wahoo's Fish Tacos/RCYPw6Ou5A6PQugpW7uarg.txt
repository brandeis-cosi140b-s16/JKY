If you're from coastal California you probably already know about Wahoos. But this is Vegas. Its about the only bar in town I've found with the front doors open and the laid back beach vibe you're used to. Its nice to be able to go to a Wahoos that you can actually park at and not have to stand behind some tanned up skinny jeans mofo straight from MTV's newest "The Real OC" show then have to battle for a table no bigger than a skateboard deck. $2 miller lights on the weekends and 24 hour Wahoos food. Plus plenty of TVs to watch sports on. The staff is extremely friendly and inviting as well.
