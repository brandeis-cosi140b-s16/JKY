Great food!!  Awesome staff!  Super fun environment!!!!  Nikki rocks!!!  My husband and I love the burritos!!!  So good!  The gaming bar is always lively and fun.  It is a great place to hang with friends, have some beers, and watch some football.  Their outdoor patio is gonna be a nice spot to relax in the fall and spring months, when the weather is nice.  I would recommend Wahoo's Tacos highly.  Food is delicious, staff is laid back and friendly, restaurant is clean and comfortable.  Love this place!
