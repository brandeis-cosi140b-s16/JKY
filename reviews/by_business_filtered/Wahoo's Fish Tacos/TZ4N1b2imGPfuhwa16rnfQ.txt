Let's start the new year off with some healthy eating!

I have been waiting a long time for Wahoos Fish Taco to come to Las Vegas!  And it's finally here!  And it's a big step up from that place with the bell in the logo!

Fresh, fast, and wholesome..Wahoos is a place every personal trainer can love!  The X-treme athletes and surfers dig it as well.  Pretty evident by all the cool skate, surf, and snowboarding stuff used to decorate the place.  It's a nice change of pace and a good place to hang out and grub with your friends after a long day of play.

Wahoos is a nice mix of Mexican-American with an Asian flair (founders are some righteous Asian surfer dudes) with a great amount of good complex carbs and protein.  Everything is fresh and full of flavor with lots of items having low amounts of fat.  You got starters, tacos, enchiladas, burritos, bowls, and salads and sandwiches to soothe a hungry appetite.  The kids get their own menu too.

My fav starters are the Maui Onion Rings (which coincidentally are fried and fatty yum) and the nachos with chicken.  The choice of fillings for your entrees are phenomenal:

-Chicken - Grilled or Cajun
-Carnitas 
-Fish - Grilled or Cajun
-Carne Asada
-Shrimp
-Tofu
-Mushrooms
-Vegetarian
-Banzai Veggies - bell peppers, onions, zucchini, broccoli, mushrooms, and cabbage all sauteed with their house teriyaki sauce

My go to is usually one of their combo plates, combo #4 to be exact "The Kahuna".  It has your choice of one taco, one burrito or enchilada.  Each combo comes with white or brown rice (for a little more), and black or cajun beans.  My #1 filling is their grilled fish, it goes excellent on their tacos!  I like the fish or chicken on my burrito, and I often add some Banzai Veggies to it.  It's a full meal!

Wahoos is good on the wallet too, items on the menu go from the $5-8 range.  Gettin' full on a tiny budget, that's what it's all about!  Service is fast and friendly too.  This Wahoos is also fully equipped with a bar!  Wanna hang out with your friends and get some primo drinks and eats?  Do it all here in one place!  Sure beats some of the local dives around town here.  

You'll be glad to know too that Wahoos will be opening another location here in the Summerlin area of town real soon...right in Boca Park!  All I need now is some sand beneath my feet, a pair of bright floral surf shorts, my Blu Blocker sunglasses, some SPF on my nose, and a shave ice in my hand.  I could deal without the 110 degree heat though!  Totally gnarly, dude!!
