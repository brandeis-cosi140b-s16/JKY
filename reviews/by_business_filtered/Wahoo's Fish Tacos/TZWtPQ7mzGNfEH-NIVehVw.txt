I love me some Wahoo's Fish Tacos. I am so happy this place is in Summerlin. I love going and sitting on there patio. They have great deals on Pacifico Beer ( $ 2.00). How can you beat that? 

I normally get the fish taco plate with rice and beans and it is awesome. Last time I was there the cashier recommended the Outer Reef Burrito with fish. It was HUGE and so good. I ate the entire thing and did not regret it =) 

The only downfall is that it is very hot inside the actual restaurant. I don't think they have a/c. This stinks if there is no room on the patio and you are forced to sit inside.
