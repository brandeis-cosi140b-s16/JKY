Wahoo's is in a few words: a God send. The Calimex/Baja inspired menu has strong variety and some of the best prices in town considering the quality of the food. This isn't typical bar food. My personal favorite dish there to get are the Wahoo Fries (with black beans). You'll thank me later... They are life changing. Other recommendations include the Burning Rolls and Carne Asada Tacos. The best thing is that everything looks and tastes fresh.... While being extremely easy on your wallet.

The bar is pretty standard fare, though I've gone to Wahoos during twilight hours only, so I am ignorant to happy hour specials they run for their food and drinks, which I am sure are numerous. If you ever visit Wahoos late night, make sure you get Brian as your bartender, great, great guy. 

The ambiance of Wahoos is pretty upbeat, you get a California beach vibe from the decor and lighting, and it isn't so drab like other variety bars. Overall, given the bang for your buck, I must give Wahoos my highest recommendation. 5 stars.
