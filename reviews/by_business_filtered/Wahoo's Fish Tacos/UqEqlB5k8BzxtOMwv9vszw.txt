Don't understand all of the hype! The employee in front was not friendly at all, they forgot about our appetizer (even though he obviously rang it in cuz we were charged for it) so we didn't get it until after our meal, and the tacos were just okay and the nachos sucked! I thought I'd give this place a second try until I woke up this morning. I feel like someone is punching my stomach and my boyfriend is not feeling well either. Definitely NOT going back!
