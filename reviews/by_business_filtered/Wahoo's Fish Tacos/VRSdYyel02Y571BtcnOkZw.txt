Service sucks! Bar area is a smoke filled room with worse service then the food area...what a let down. Great location for something good. Just NOT THIS. Ugh...hoping for a good place to open in this area soon. FINISHING my review 8-29-2013 I went back cause a friend said his buddy runs the place. MISTAKE AGAIN. I WILL NOT RETURN. POOR POOR BAR SERVICE & "dining area" haha more like a middle school lunch room. They really need to get rid of the front area where YOU STAND and wait to order.They should put tables in and hire actual wait staff!
