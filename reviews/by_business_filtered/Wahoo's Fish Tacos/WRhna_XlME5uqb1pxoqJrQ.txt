Lots of good choices on the menu...and then a lot more options for each menu item.  
Brown or White Rice
Black or Pinto Beans
Fish, Chicken, Pork, Steak, Tofu, Veggies

Most items are above average but nothing that makes me want to come back right away.

...oh yeah, and Kona now has competition for 40 - 55 year old males on the prowl, scoping out the young ladies and showing off their rides...did we need another place like that?...Might lower things a star or two for me if I was a lady not looking for a sugar daddy...but sense I'm descent guy it actually acts as a self-esteem booster!
