Oh how I have missed Wahoo's!  This location did a great job curbing my Wahoo's craving.

The outer reef burrito was fantastic as always.  The guac was a littlw lacking especially when you pay more but it was still delicious.  I wish I was closer to a Wahoo's but maybe that is what makes it taste so good.

One burrito is extremely filling but sooooo good.  I have never had a bad experience at a Wahoo's and look forward to the next visit.
