After eating here for the first time I realized I would have been better off going to Wendy's instead.  My food was terrible.  And, how the fu@k do you run out of forks when nobody is in your establishment?  Won't ever be eating here again.  Save yourself the disappointment and go to any of the other nearby restaurants. F this place.  F them right in the ear.
