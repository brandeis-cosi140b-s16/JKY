I was weary about coming to this place because my co-workers informed me that they were told this place had the best fish tacos. Now, I am a bit picky when it comes to that. I ordered the fish "taquitos" and asked the cashier if it was spicy and he said no. I then proceeded with the order and around 6 minutes later a lady comes and hands me what appears to be a beef taquito. I was confuse because from the picture, I thought I had order "soft shell" fish tacos. Plus, it did not look like fish it looked like beef because the meat inside was black. I was baffled and the lady then asked me if it was the order I had ordered. I didn't want to make a situation worse and then Tashia, our food delivery attendant that was assisting us asked, "Would you like me to bring you the correct order and would you want it with the same side orders?" I was thrown aback because nowadays, no one does that, they first argue with you or make you pay extra for an incorrect order! I was so ecstatic that she asked. I would highly recommend this food establishment.
