Food was OK not bad at all but i was not impressed because they didn't have too many choices for fish i only saw one kind of fish. Even though the name says fish taco they had more of other stuff , carne asada, chicken and pork. And the fish that they did have didn't taste so good it was kind of dry for me. They had a decent carne asada burrito though. This is not a place i would get hooked on to and have a craving for but its a good place to try.
