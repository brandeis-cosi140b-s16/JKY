This place is pretty good, which for some reason surprised me. 

The best part is the wide selection and ways in which you can tweak your meal. To me that makes it an improvement over other similar chains. 

I was impressed by the price for the amount of food. It's rare that I can't finish a $7 lunch. 

The quality of the food was sort of what I would have expected. Certainly wasn't planning on receiving gourmet fare, but I was hoping for slightly higher quality. 

Regardless, for a quick healthy lunch, this is a good option for a great price.
