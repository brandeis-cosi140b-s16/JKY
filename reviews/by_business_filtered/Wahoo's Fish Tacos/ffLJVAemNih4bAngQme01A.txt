Was so excited to see a new eatery open nearby. Have been here twice- both times it took awhile to get to the front of the line to order & both times our food came 30 minutes after ordering. The food was decent- chips & salsa were kind of disappointing. Spicy chicken enchiladas with spicy green sauce were delicious & my husband's burrito could feed 2. Portions were huge! Had to flag down cocktail server to order $2 ice cold beers- love that! I really want this place to do well- get an additional cocktail server & deliver the food a little faster & things would be greatly improved. Wish you could just order bottled beer @ the register! I could see this place doing great if they can work out a few kinks.
