Just as good as the Wahoo's in California, plus it has a bar! ;)  The food is excellent and the people are friendly.  What more could you want?  The manager took the time to chat with me about locations and to ask if I have eaten at a Wahoo's before.  This is the kind of service I know at the Wahoo's in Laguna, and I'm glad to see it here.  Welcome to Las Vegas, Wahoo's!!!
