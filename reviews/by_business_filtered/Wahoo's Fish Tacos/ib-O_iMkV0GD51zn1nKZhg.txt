Grilled fish taco was awesome!  Taquitos were solid but Baja rolls were just ok. My wife and I sat at the bar and felt like we were outsiders and service was rushed on us to get us in and out. Female bartender should be a prison guard but the big guy was friendly enough behind the bar. We'll probably go back but sit on patio facing the door.
