We wanted to like this place, but the food was dull and the service was... The atmosphere lends itself to a beach hole-in-the-wall, but the reality is a smokey hole far from any beach freshness - food or air. We ordered the vegetarian nachos, outer reef burrito, wet classic burrito, quesadillas, and chicken taquitos all to-go. It took a over a half-hour to get our food, mostly because they kept giving us an incomplete order insisting it was complete. The food had very little flavor. The nachos and outer reef burrito reminded me of something you would throw together with what is left in your refrigerator - very uninspiring and dry. Speaking of dry, the wet burrito was hardly wet. The quesadillas were akin to cafeteria food. The chicken taquitos had more whole bay leaves in them than chicken. The chips were crisp but flavorless, and the "salsa" was equally so with a touch of heat. Obviously, won't be going back.
