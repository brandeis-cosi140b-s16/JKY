This was the third time my fiance and I have been here and we are never going back. Service has never been good. We have always gone to the bar. They are super friendly but when it ucomes to giving you service they are way under par. Food is decent and very good priced but after this last time where I had to send back my meal because it was too cold and took forever to even get them to ask us what we wanted to eat, I cannot give them another chance. Also had to constantly flag the bartender down for a new beer. But the final straw was the fact that we gambled about $70 between the 2 of us we only got 2 beers comped. As someone in the service industry and works as a cocktail server and has bartended, I know what the proper comp system is. Had no compensation for having to wait at least 15 min for my new meal as well.. We've had problems the last 2 times as well but tried to give them a chance since they are new (and very close to home) but not after this time. So sad:(
