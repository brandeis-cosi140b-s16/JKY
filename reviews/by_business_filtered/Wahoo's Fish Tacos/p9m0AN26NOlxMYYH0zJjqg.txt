When I first walked in it seemed like a clean, decent place. The menu doesn't state that brown rice is extra compared to white. Nick was walking around talking on his cellphone the whole time even while serving us our food. The waitresses need to wear longer shorts. They were disgustingly short. I don't want to look at another girls butt cheeks while eating my lunch. The food was okay, would probably only come back for the Kahlua pork. But other than that, I will probably not visit again.
