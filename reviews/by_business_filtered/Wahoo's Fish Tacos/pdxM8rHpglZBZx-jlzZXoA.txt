Loved the decor of the place.  Loved the bar being off to the side and closed off so adults can have their privacy.  The front staff was very nice.  Liked the selection of some of the drink choices.  I had the shrimp bowl with white rice.  It was good, the shrimp was tasty.  It was a little bland for me.  It would be nice a salsa bar, but the wait staff brought me some mild salsa.  My boss ordered a fish taco/enchilado combo which they messed up the order and brought him two tacos.  He didn't return it and just ate it.  The chips were fresh and the salsa was good.  I will try it again and see how I like it.  I did like what I had and love the fact that someone finally took this spot and I hope they can get things figured out.  We need better choices to dine in the 89002/89015 area.
