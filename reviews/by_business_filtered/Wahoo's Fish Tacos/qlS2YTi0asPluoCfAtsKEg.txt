Need to watch some football, grab a beer and get chips and salsa... Wahoo is your place. Want to enjoy some delicious tacos, beans and rice...not so much. Lemon Drop Martini, how can you not know how to make one... YUCK! Big pieces of tasteless chicken tacos, beef tacos were inedible, again big pieces that were chewy and plain gross. Pork was OK but somewhat tasteless and fish taco just ok! This place has a lot going for it but poor bar-tending, OK service and sub-par food make it it somewhere I will not go back to...Pick Jasons Deli next door or head to Kona grill..and with Gordon B and Cheesecake F in the same complex they better step it up or step out! Don't expect to enjoy a beer here next summer...just my opinion!
