Our family's favorite place to eat in Henderson! It's very close to home so we were excited when they came to Henderson and for the last couple of years they continue to impress us!! Love the fish tacos totally cool atmosphere and really friendly staff!! Love to take the kids here for a fun fresh family dinner!! Also enjoy the amazing view from the bar with the hubby for a nice night out without the kiddos!!  Price is nice and we all enjoy!!
