May be my new favorite place to come with the hubby! I love the grilled fish tacos with citrus slaw and white rice and cajun beans. The hubby gets the outer reef burrito wet with red sauce. I also enjoy the coconut breeze cocktail and he loves that they have Guinness on tap. Love this place for a quick bite and place to chill!
