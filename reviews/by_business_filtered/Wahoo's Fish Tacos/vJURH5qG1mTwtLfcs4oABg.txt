We went here for an early dinner on a Thursday. Thought we try it out since it's only minutes from our house. The menu was alright, the prices on the food are reasonable. We ordered the shrimp bowl with brown rice with beans & two shrimp tacos with rice and beans as well. We sat down a table with booth seating, and noticed that no one had cleaned off the table. As for the drinks, we had ice water, ordered Corona and the skinny long island ice tea from a waitress who had walked by. When I was about to drink the long island, I noticed a big chip on the inside of my glass. So I waited until another staff member came by and I told her about the glass, she took it from me and returned with a new clean glass & drink. The food was okay in flavor, it wasn't delicious. I don't think we're going to come back...only because a few minutes after we ate, both our stomachs were acting up...it's a sign that the food was not as fresh as it looks. :(
The good thing about Wahoo's - the staff members are very friendly and the atmosphere reminds me of Hawaii & Cali.
