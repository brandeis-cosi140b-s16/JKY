The mushroom enchilada with green sauce is amazing! I also had a grilled fish taco with black beans and rice. The food came out quickly and was fresh and tasty. I love the laid back atmosphere of this place. The portion was plentiful and the free drink refills were a plus. I will definitely be back.
