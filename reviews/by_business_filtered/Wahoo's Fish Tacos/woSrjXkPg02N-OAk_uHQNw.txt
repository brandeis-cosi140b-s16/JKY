I'm thinking some of the bad reviews may be from evening visits? We typically come in for lunch and the service is always very friendly and attentive.  However, went in for dinner one night and there is a huge difference - evening crew needs some definite customer service training and the food was poor quality as well.

But, the good stuff we love:

Chicken tacos - delicious!  Traditional street taco style, plenty of meat, great sauces (green sauce needs a bit more flavor)
Chicken enchilada - my FAVE!  The red sauce is fabulous!
The salsa (pico de gallo style) is always fresh and chips have always been fresh and crispy
Maui Bowl - very good teriyaki, not oversauced


The not-so-good:

I ordered chicken tortilla soup hoping for a Mexican-style tortilla soup but instead got a bowl of what could have been Progresso chicken noodle with some tortilla strips on top.  No taste, definitely not what I had in mind for "tortilla soup" - very disappointing.

The choices of rice and beans is a little weird - plain white or brown rice and either black beans or Cajun beans.  My husband enjoys these options and the portions are generous and always cooked well, but I always opt for ala carte because none of those really appeal to me.

Some of the items are a little pricey - for instance, the Wahoo's Salad is a very bare bones, basic salad for almost $8.  But my ala carte enchilada with chips and salsa for under $5...I could eat that every day.
