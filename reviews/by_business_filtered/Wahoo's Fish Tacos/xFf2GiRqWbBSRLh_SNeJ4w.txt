I keep going back, hoping that the staff will eventually start to feel at home and begin to provide some level of service. Sadly, it has not been the case, which is the inspiration behind this downgraded rating. 

To be sure, the food is still good, the atmosphere is still great and the crowd is still eclectic - but the service is actually getting worse.

This place is far too small to have to wait forever to be refilled or simply even recognized, especially if you are sitting right there in front of the bartenders. Sometimes it actually feels as though they are purposefully trying to avoid eye contact. 

Hey management - this is Vegas, we got hundreds of bartenders looking for work, it shouldn't be hard to find ONE.
