On the request of a fellow co-worker we decided to check out this dig today. I grew up in M.V. In SoCal. Oh the days of basking in the sun surfing the "outside" and listening to rancid and suicidal tendencies down at San Clemente pier.. This brought me back with good tunes and good friends and great food... Reminded me how awesome life was prior to a life of responsibilities.. I'll be coming back
