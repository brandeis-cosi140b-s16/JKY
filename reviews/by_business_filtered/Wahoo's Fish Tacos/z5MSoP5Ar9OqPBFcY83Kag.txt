I aate here once before and found it so-so, but was in the area and thought I'd give it a 2nd try. This time I ordered a  Bonzai Burrito w/chicken and brown rice & black beans to go. Waited for about 10 minutes for it to be made.When I got to my destination several miles away I bit into the burrito and it was a carnitas, basic burrito without rice or beans. I called to complain & let the manager know. He apologized and offered to have me come back again and he'll comp the food, but that didn't make up for how disappointed and unsatisfied I was. I think the staff needs to work harder at making sure the order is right before it gets in the customer's hands. In addition, since I was really hungry and didn't have any time to go get something else, I ate the burrito and it wasn't very good. Not sure I'll ever go back.
