Nady makes me want to move to Vegas! What a gem! We ended up staying for hours just because her energy and drinks are by far the best thing in the whole casino! She invented a drink called the black swan and I think it would make an amazing martini or shot! We did not eat any food but it looked pretty! The dragon berry tea is scrumptious and the margaritas are spectacular!!
