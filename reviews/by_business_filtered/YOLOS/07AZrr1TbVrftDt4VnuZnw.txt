Not really authentic mexican food, but it's a step up from a Chevy's - the food is still very good for the price, especially during happy hour. 

They have Margaronas! 


They have a "skinny" menu - low calorie drinks + meals, i ordered the vegetarian burrito with the Skinny Margarita, which was very strong. They also have a decent happy hour menu - burritos, enchiladas with sides for like $10. 

Not bad, it's worth trying.
