Three of us were attending a huge dental seminar at The Planet Hollywood and the resturants were full with huge waiting times.  We needed to eat dinner and board our plane.  Yolos staff, especally, Tanya, got us in and out on time!  The food was great and service great and everyone was happy!  Nice to have people help you when you need it badly!  Thank yolos and Tanya!
