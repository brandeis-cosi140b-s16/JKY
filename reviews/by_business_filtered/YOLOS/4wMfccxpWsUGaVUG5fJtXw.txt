This weekend my friends and I were in the mood for some mexican food while on the strip.  We thought we'd try Cabo Wabo, but when we walked in, it was so crowded and we could barely fit into our table because the seating was so tight between tables.  Also, it was really too loud to have a conversation.  I remembered passing Yolos inside the Planet Hollywood casino, so we decided to go there instead.  It wasn't crowded at all, the food was delicious and we had a waiter by the name of Gustavo who was awesome!  Since we hadn't been there before, he made recommendations from the menu and totally took care of use while we had a long relaxing lunch.  I'd highly recommend it if you're in the middle of the strip and don't want the inconvenience of waiting around for a table...
