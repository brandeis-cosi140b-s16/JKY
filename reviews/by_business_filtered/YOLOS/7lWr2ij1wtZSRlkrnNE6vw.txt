I came across this restaurant in a travel guide (yes, my family still buys them occasionally) about a year ago.  I was looking for Mexican food and initially chose Los Dos Caminos over it because they offered free chips and salsa (silly, but important...who wants to pay for just chips and salsa?!?) Now Dos Caminos is closed (so sad) so we decided to give Yolos a try.  The chips are now free (unless they always were and I was thinking of a different restaurant).  The tacos are delicious as is the cilantro rice.  I have never had rice like that before and it was amazing!  The margaritas were also delicious.  

I'm surprised at the complaints about the price.  Our meal at Yolos was cheaper than any other meals we had on our trip.  I felt that the price was comparable to my favorite Mexican restaurant in Chicago.  

We ate early, so the restaurant was almost empty.  The atmosphere is cool, dark booths illuminated by the drink menu.  Our service was excellent.

I will definitely come back on my next trip.
