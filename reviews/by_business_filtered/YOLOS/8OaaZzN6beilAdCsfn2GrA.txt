This reminds me of what TGI Friday's would be like if it were Mexican and actually used quality ingredients. It had that kind of campy, chain-restaurant feel. My shrimp salad was delicious, though! And the table-made guac was the real deal.

Drinks were weak. Wouldn't go out of my way to go here again, but definitely a solid meal if you are craving flavors from South of the border.
