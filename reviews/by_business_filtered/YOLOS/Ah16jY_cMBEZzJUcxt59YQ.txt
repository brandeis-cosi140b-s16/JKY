This place is tucked right in the front corner of the Planet Hollywood Casino if you were to walk in from the strip. If you haven't been to the casino/hotel since they did a huge overhaul then you should come visit this whole area. As for dining experiences this wouldn't be at the top of my list. If you are on a budget however this is one of the better places to dine on the Strip if you aren't in a hurry to get somewhere. 

A client invited us to dinner here for a dinner and some drinks and it was underwhelming at best. Our server ignored us constantly (even with empty beer glasses/liquor drinks) which you think he would be eager to refill for us. It was after peak dinner hours and he had 4-5 tables at best. 
We are a pretty easy going group but walking by our table over and over again with empty glasses of anything is just unacceptable. 

The food was an alright blend of Mexican food. Nothing too shocking or blow your socks off on the actual menu or unique items you will be eager to try out. 

My favorite part of the meal without question was the table side guacamole they create for you and the salsa. These provided a great snack and I wish I only ate them for my meal. The enchiladas the server recommend for me we not as exciting as these chips/salsa/guac. 

If your a tequila drinker (I am not) you can select from over 60 types at the bar here. The place seems like an appropriate place for a quick lunch when you hop off the roulette or blackjack table. The dinner we had here seemed mildly strange and not quite the right atmosphere or vibe. If our server wasn't so bad I think we could of chalked this place up to a 4 star but our lack of drink service put a damper on the night.
