Came here on a Sunday night as we were just trying to grab a quick bite to eat. For a placed named YOLOS this is definitely not where you would want to go if you only lived once. Food was average and took a long time to come out. I'd say hit up any other Mexican place and it'll taste just as good and be cheaper.
