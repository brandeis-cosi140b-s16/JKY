You know how, generally when you're starving after being on the booze train and really anything will normally taste good then? Plus, I love mexican food so yes, I loved Yolos. However, make no mistake, I'm not saying this because of the booze and my love for the type of cuisine; the food is pretty good. 

Their shrimp tacos are amazing and my burrito was very nice as well. It's a cool place to hang out over some food and drinks. The waiters and waitresses are very nice. I highly recommend it.
