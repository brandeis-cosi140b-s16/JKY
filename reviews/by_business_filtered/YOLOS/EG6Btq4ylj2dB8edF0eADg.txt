Food: I enjoyed the Shrimp Chile Relleno; but that's because I really like melted cheese. The Mexican Rice that accompanied it was well-seasoned. The Pork Chop was cooked well, but the sauce was a bit too sweet. The Chili Crusted Mahi Mahi taco was a bit bland, and the salsa that accompanied it was average.

Service: Friendly but a bit slow.

Ambience: Most of the restaurant is open to the casino; so it feels pretty much like you're eating next to slot machines and card tables.
