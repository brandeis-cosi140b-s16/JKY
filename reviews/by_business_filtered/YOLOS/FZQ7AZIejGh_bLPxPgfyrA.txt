Woohoo!  We were looking for something delicious but nice that wouldn't break the budget on the first night of our trip.  After doing a lil' Yelp research, we decided on Yolos, which is tucked away inside Planet Hollywood.  

So glad we decided to come here!  We sat at the bar, so there was ample people-watching for me - everyone in the restaurant PLUS the open side to the casino.  The prices weren't terrible - could have been a lot worse elsewhere - my chicken enchilada was around $12 (and delicious!).  Entrees like fish and steaks were $18+.  Sadly, they made us pay for the chips and salsa, which I think were around $4 - BUT the chips were pretty good and they came with a nice selection of four salsas, each very different from each other.  

Definitely recommended!
