Eh! I was very disappointed in this place! FIRST OF ALL... DO NOT go here for hookah... It is overpriced and does not even last 5 minutes... They charge by the coal, in which you pay 25 dollars for only one coal.... Needless to say the whole time the hookah was burning.... 
  Now off to the food... We ordered the chips and guacamole and when it came... there was just a to go box, with the top part cut off, full of chips...... We waited about 5-10 minutes waiting for the guacamole to come when we finally realized there was a spoon full in the middle of the tray hidden under the chips. IT WAS HORRIBLE! 
  The only reason this place gets a 2 instead of a 1 is because the manager was friendly. But I will not be returning to this place!
