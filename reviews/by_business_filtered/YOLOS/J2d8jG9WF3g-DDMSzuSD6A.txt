We stumbled on Yolos while walking around looking for a casual bite after a show.  The hostess was super friendly.  Waiter came promptly.  The top-shelf margaritas were...yeah: top-freakin'-notch.  Wow!  Too many times we've been disappointed by so-called top-shelf margs made with mix.  Not at Yolos.  These guys break out the good stuff: all handcrafted.  The prices are stellar ($13 each) but considering the location and being on vacation, who gives a damn.  Go to the craps table and spend a bit of your winnings on a truly good drink.  The food was quite good but not as memorable.  Would we return?  Hells to the yes!
