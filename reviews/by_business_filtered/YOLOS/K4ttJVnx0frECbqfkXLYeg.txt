Walking thru planet Hollywood deciding where to eat we where given a flyer for a free tequila shot...so hey let's head over..it's "trendy" Mexican style food. Nachos consists of 5 individual nachos with steak and all the toppings.. but once you order off the appetizer menu the food is delicious. After 11pm this grill become a salsa nightclub, nice music and crowd but not the place to stay all night, even thou when we walked past this place at 6am to the parking garage people where waiting in line to get in.
