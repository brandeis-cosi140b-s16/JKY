Probably the worst tacos I have had to date. I ordered the shrimp tacos. They cost approximately $15 for 3 tacos, rice and black beans. I absolutely love all Mexican food and rarely find places that get tacos so wrong. The shrimp was very chewy (although I will admit they do serve a large portion of shrimps within the tacos - they were just barely flavored and the texture seemed off - not worth it at all) The cilantro rice wasn't bad, but I won't say it was good - it also lacked flavor. Lastly the black beans were inedible. They tasted as if they came right out of the can, barely cooked.  I hate to waste food but in this case I took a couple of bites and paid the check. I was in no mood to explain how terrible the food was but it would have been nice if I was offered an alternative when the tacos were suggested by the staff and barely touched.
