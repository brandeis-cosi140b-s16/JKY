Full bar, One of the best in Vegas. Partly because of the food and the ambiance, but mostly because of the staff. Everyone was helpful, knowledgeable and more importantly all around fun! It was easy to spend hours there just drinking and having a good time before going out to the clubs. Britney was by far the best, between her original custom drinks, she was just so much fun and took care of everyone! If this review hasn't persuaded you to give this place a try, at least give it a shot for Britney! She'll make sure you have a good time and you'll end up coming back.
