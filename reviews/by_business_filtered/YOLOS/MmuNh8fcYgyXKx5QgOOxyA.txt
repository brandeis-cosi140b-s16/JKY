Came into Yolos for happy Howe st at the bar and the server came right in front of me did a bunch of things on the register and did not even acknowledge us even though I know she saw us. Many minutes later she came and took our order. The food here was amazing. We had the steak nachos and chicken quesadilla. very high quality meats and products used to make the food. If you dint mind the not so great service stop in and try the food.

I give the food 5 stars and the service 1 star
