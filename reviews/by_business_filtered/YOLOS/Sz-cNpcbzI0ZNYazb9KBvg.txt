Came during the 10$ lunch special. Burrito was good. Tacos were yummy. Steak for both! The salsa was bomb! 

Only thing I did not like was that you cannot bring outside food or drinks. We had just bought fat Tuesday's and had to make a trip all the way back to the room when we were starving!! THEN we saw someone able to bring in an outside meal. Just a tad bit annoying that the rule was enforced on us but not them.
