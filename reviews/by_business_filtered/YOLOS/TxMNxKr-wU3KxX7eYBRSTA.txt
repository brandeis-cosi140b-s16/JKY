Yolos is one of my favorite places to eat in the world.  Maybe it is because it is always the first place I go to when I get to Vegas so I am excited and in a great mood but every time I go there there food is great, it is at reasonable prices and the service is quick.  Not a fancy Vegas restaurant by any means but if you are looking for a quick sit down dinner with good food and drinks at a good price Yolos is the place.
