Was in Vegas for business and did not feel like doing the "vegas" thing and wanted to instead do the relax and in suite spa thing. After looking at the room service menu and realizing that I am not P DIDDY I realized that there was nothing on the room service menu for me in my price range. So instead I went down stairs ordered some food from Yolos and never looked back. Took it to go. 

I ordered the quesadillas which were really good. It came with side of sour, guac and salsa. It was big enough for me as a full meal. Plus it was about half the price of the room service food. And they were quick. The meal was ready in about 5-7 minutes. 

You'll have to go grab a drink from an ABC store in the mall cause they have drinks too but don't have lids for their cups which when walking through a crowded casinos full of drunks is a necessary. 

If I stay at the Planet again I will eat here again. Good food inside the casino.
