A week after my visit I was contacted personally by the manager of this branch. She called me on the phone and apologized for my having gotten sick and assured me that she would personally coach her team to ensure that this wouldn't happen to anyone else. She was sincere, professional, and kind and I appreciate that more than anything. I honestly would visit again now knowing how seriously she took this issue of allergies. The fact that she took time out of her busy day to contact me, refund my bill and assure me her team would be coached speaks volumes. I'm so happy that one day I can return and know I will be able to eat without worrying about getting sick! 

Thank you Staci
