I've been here about five times in the past five years and this restaurant never fails me. I always get the strawberry margarita blended and it comes in a cool glass. It isn't authentic Mexican food, more like Southwestern with a twist. The menu is limited and you have to pay for chips and salsa if you want them ($3 is all). I recommend the chicken enchiladas, caesar salad, and the flautas.
