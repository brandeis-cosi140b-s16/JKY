I'll be honest... this place is not great.  I was killing a few hours before my red eye flight, and came here because I was craving some Mexican food.  I really should have gone elsewhere.

Pros - friendly service.
The guacamole was actually pretty good.

Cons -
The tortilla chips did not taste fresh and were not very good.
They didn't offer burritos.... what?  They only offer burritos M-Thurs (or something like that.)
The chicken quesadilla definitely tasted like something I could have made at home and was unimpressive.  Part of it was soggy (with what?  no idea), and there was dead space along the whole outside of the quesadilla that didn't have any fillings... so it was just bland tortillas.  Meh.

YOLO, so you should probably go somewhere else.
