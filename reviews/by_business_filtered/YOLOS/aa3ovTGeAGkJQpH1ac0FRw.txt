Fun little bar and restaurant located inside Planet Hollywood on the strip.  My husband and I were in Vegas for 4 days and visited Yolos three times.

Our bartender Chris was very engaging, setting waters and menus down in front of us before we even got completely situated at the bar.  He kept the drinks strong and coming.  We ordered chips and salsa to soak up some of the booze, and were pleasantly surprised with the huge portion size.  We couldn't finish them, and they were only $3.50, which is a bargain for the location.

We will definitely return to Yolos on our next Vegas vacation!
