Yolos is so amazing and the bartenders are so fun and in tune with the customers! We came in the first time after long flight, no food all day and lost luggage wah wah! The guys were so fast to get us two drinks a piece and chips, salsa, guacamole and the best margaritas! Beautiful eyes Brian and   Guerillmo are so friendly and fun. Thanks guys and of course Stacy the manager is terrific too. Thanks for taking such good care of us and welcoming us back on our last day in town. The chicken tacos are small but have great flavor and it is grilled chicken. The happy hour is great Monday - Thursday. Check it out!
