Got in late from the East Coast and I was hungry from a 5 hour flight. I love Mexican food (See reviews) and saw that my Hotel had one.  Hard to think that any of these enormous hotels on the Strip would not have a little of everything hen it comes to food!  

I made a quick choice of the Mahi-Mahi Taco's and a Fat Tire beer.  A good combo for me! The Taco's were outstanding with great flavor and a nice piece of fish in each one.  The Guacamole was not so good, might have been the batch, but it had to much lemon/lime juice in it.  This is a good restaurant.  I sat at the bar and the service was good.
