I know what my friends will say... Chris why did you go to a cheap secondary restaurant in Vegas when you ball so hard motherf***ers wanna fine me, That s*** crazy, That s*** crazy.  Well, a friend of ours got so loaded that he couldn't even articulate his name let alone probably be let into CUT over in the Palazzo.  So we went here and was surprisingly amazed at the quality of this food.  We started off with the Salsa Trio as a group and then I got the Street Tacos Dinner (Chicken Breast, Pork Carnitas and Mexican Gulf Shrimp).  Honestly so good.  This place is dirty cheap.  People who are getting upset regarding cost must be used to eating Fat Burger or In N' Out.  We had four guys who ordered meals and boozed and it was under $100 bucks.

DISCLAIMER:  I had been drinking most of the day (and previous night) probably had a slight sun stroke and was up around $400 bucks.  I was feeling pretty good so I hope this does not bleed over into my usual unbiased recommendations.
