The host was not very friendly and almost turned our party away based on our size. We sat in the bar during happy hour and our party was crammed into a tight corner and told we couldn't order for happy hour. The bartender was flustered as she was a server for the bar as well. When our drinks arrived they were watered down and had to be remade. Fingers crossed for our entrees as they came out within a reasonable time. So far not impressed.
