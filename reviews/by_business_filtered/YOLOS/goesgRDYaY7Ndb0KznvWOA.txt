This is my go to place in Vegas!  You must see Chris and Nady at the bar!  They are amazing!  They make me feel at home while I am there and remember my face when I walk in.  They have one of the best happy hours in Vegas - $5 dishes and $5 Margaritas!  The food is tasty and fulfilling.  I honestly can't say enough about this place!
