I'm a huge fan of Yolos.  I've eaten here probably a half-dozen times in the past two years, and it's on my short list every time I'm in the general area.  

It's not really "authentic" Mexican, but they do put out some damn good food.  They've got their own spin on some Mexican classics, which I like.  The happy hour deals (3pm-6pm M-Th, 5 items, $5 each) are all outstanding and a great value.
