Stopped in here to hang with some friends and most likely won't be back. The music is way to damn loud. Seriously you can't hear the person sitting right next to you let alone sitting across from you. The booths are so cramped together that you play a game of "kicking footsie" with others at your table. My wife accidentally got kicked from the person sitting across from her and she was bleeding. Like missing a toenail bleeding. The food tasted decent however you don't get enough for the cost and it certainly isn't authentic Mexican food.
