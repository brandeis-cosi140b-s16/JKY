A cool modern Mexican restaurant tucked away on the main floor of Planet Hollywood.  Great bar view of the entire casino.

I had a Dos Equis Amber for $6 which tasted like a burnt Mexican Bud Light - yes it was awful.  Should have done the Fat Tire.  And a grilled chicken tostada salad for $12 that was not bad.  Good food and drinks, good prices, hip atmosphere, all at one of the newer Strip properties strikes me as a great deal.  

One complaint: the bartender - who gave me the Dos Equis when I asked for a dark beer? - was very pretty and just as rude.  Just a lot of unnecessary attitude.  She reminded me of a quote by the travel writer Bill Bryson:

"I have no problem with poor service - it makes it so much easier to not tip."
