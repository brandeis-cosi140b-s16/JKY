Get the flautas. You will not regret it! 

We were iffy about getting Mexican food outside of San Diego, but a man passing by told us to try their happy hour menu as we were hesitating in front, so we did!

$5 margarita
$5 steak tacos
$5 chips and salsa with guac
$5 carnitas flautas 

Very happy with our selection. I can't say enough about the flautas, definitely my favorite of what we selected. Also, the music is so on point right now; I've heard three 'Nsync songs while we've sat here for 30 minutes

If you're considering a quick stop for happy hour appetizers, this is a safe bet.
