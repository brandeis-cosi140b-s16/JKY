Portobello mushroom fajitas yum! For Vegas, this place insite PH was a great stop and not terribly expensive. The fresh chips and salsa were fantastic - tasted home made. My fajitas were nearly enough for two people had we ordered some additional tortillas. Onions, peppers, thick cut portobello, and some cilantro rice and black beans....YUM! I would definitely suggest coming here. No 5 stars because service was a bit slow....even when hardly anyone was in the restaurant and my eating date's mahi mahi tacos seemed a bit skimpy.  But overall great food.
