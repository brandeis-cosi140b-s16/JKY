I wouldn't call this your traditional Mexican, of course. I went here with a very large party for a pre-wedding dinner. I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but I was really surprised but what I got!

At the time, I had no idea what 'YOLO' meant. I regret fully that I do now, but alas. ANYWAY.

The food was fantastic. Had a little bit of everything -steak, chicken, fish, some appetizers I had no idea what they were but were delicious. The desserts were amazing as well, a mixture of many different things you could just pick out.

Oh, did I mention for this particular event there were unlimited margaritas and beer? Oh yes.
