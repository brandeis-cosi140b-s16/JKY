hmmm...... I went here cause my friends said that this place was really good. But I was pretty disappointed. I forgot what I my sister and I ordered but it really wasn't that tasty. But I heard that the soft tacos were pretty good. I actually thought that this place was pretty pricey. It was around $10-$12 a dish. But the chips and salsa were really good.
