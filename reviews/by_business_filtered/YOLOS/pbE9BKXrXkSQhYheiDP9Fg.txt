This place ins hidden in the maze also known as Planet Hollywood. They serve up delicious drinks and food at decent prices but beware they do not take total rewards comps... They do allow for room charges but only if you are staying on property... Not sure why they don't do it - was told their data base / system has not been updated yet.  

Give this a place a try when in PH.  Definitely worth it especially if Earl of Sandwich or Pinks is too busy.
