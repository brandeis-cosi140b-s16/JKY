Happy Hour review only!

$4 hh specials - Margaritas, wine, tacos, flautas and tequitos. 
Yes, very Americanized but the flavors were excellent! 

Don't bother ordering the wine as I believe it was wine from a box quality. The Margaritas were decent (for $4) and it is available only at the bar.

The carnitas flautas were suprising delicious. It's lighty fried with a green avocodo sauce on top. The tacos and tequitos were just OK. 

We've ordered 8 things all together and the bill was only $32. If you are up late and looking for a snack at 2pm, this is the place to be!!
