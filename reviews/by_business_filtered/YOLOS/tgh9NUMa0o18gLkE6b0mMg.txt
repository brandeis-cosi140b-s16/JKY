We wanted something a little different so made reservations for Yolo's for dinner. We got a table near the front where you can people watch and the seats were nicely coushened. 

We started off with chips and salsa, which were pretty good. There wasn't too much spice to the salsa, but it was good.

For dinner I had the beef enchiladas. They were good, but kinda "eh". There was no spice and not much extra flavor to speak of. 

We had a coupon from the hotel for BOGO margaritas and the margs were definitely good!

Our waiter came by about 45 seconds or so and asked if we were okay or needed anything. We kept telling him no and he kept saying "Good, no rush". Having someone tell you "no rush" every 45 seconds kind of makes you feel rushed. I don't think we were in here 45 minutes.
