This review is based solely on their happy hour. I didn't eat but I did partake in 3 or so margaritas. 

The margaritas during happy hour are 5 bucks which is amazing for Vegas and they are strong. I highly recommend them!!

The service is SLOW. They only had one waitress on so you have to be a little agressive and ask for drinks when they pass by but for five bucks, you can't really go wrong!!

Happy Hour is from 3-5 and it's the best one I found on the strip!
