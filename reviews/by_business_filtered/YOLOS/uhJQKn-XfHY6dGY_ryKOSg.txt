Stopped and had lunch here with our kids on Thanksgiving day... The place was fairly empty. But it was a cute little place. 

Our server was really quiet nice and on top of everything. Very friendly and efficient.

Our food on the other hand, was much different... I was very disappointed, especially the cost of what little we received.

My son wanted the steak nachos... However the menu doesn't tell you that what you get is 5-6 tortilla chips with a single piece of steak, jalepeno, and cheese on them and that's your "nachos"...  My son was not impressed and was still hungry... I shared my mediocre taquitos with him.

The tortilla soup was less than impressive and was fairly watery. 

Lots of money for sub par food. Not worth it in our books to return.
