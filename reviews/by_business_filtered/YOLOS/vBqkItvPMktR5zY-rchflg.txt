im sorry i found this mexican resturant inside the planet holly wood casino. i like this mexican resturant so much i ate here 2 days in a row for an early dinner. about 4:00 p.m.  service was good but could be better. i really enjoyed the sizzling mushroom Fajitas with beans on the side . i told them no thanks to the rice so i dont know how the rice is. 

its a very good choice if youre a vegan and nightmare if youre on a low calorie diet because you are guarented to gain weight.  i finished eating 4:10 p.m. its 10:47 p.m. and im still full. 
thanks yolo's for destroying my diet with youre above average delicious food.
