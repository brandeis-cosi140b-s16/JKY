I have allergies and they assured me I was safe to eat, once my food arrived I was again assured that the food was gluten free and dairy free. After a few bites I was notified that there was butter in my rice. They still made me pay for everything. So rude and didn't care that I'm going to be throwing up all day. You ruined up my day. Thanks.
