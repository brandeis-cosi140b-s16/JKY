This place does not have a name brand chef, true that. The price is in line for the food served considering this is Vegas & the strip. The 2 of us ate for $54. Our bar tab for 2 delicious Margo-Ronas was $24 pushing the tab & tip up. Perhaps I'm not feeling the pinch because a similar drink in DC would cost more. 

For entrees, we had the Pork-Pibil (4.25 stars) & the Steak Picado (3 stars), service by Gustavo(4.5 stars), ambiance (4.5 stars), drinks(5 stars). Average = 4.25 for rating. That is a-okay in a city with so many big name chefs and prices. If you are not a buffet grazer, this is a very decent alternative.

This restaurant is inside Planet Hollywood Casino, near PF Chang's.
