Went for apps mid-afternoon before late, late dinner reservations. Sat at the bar. Cool ambiance, cool people. Moe, bartender, was sexy, to be completely honest! The food was delicious, perfect sized portions. I had the chicken quesadilla app, and it comes w a scoop of guacamole and sour cream on the side. Tons of fun, would def go back.
