The only and one star is due to the service. The waiter was nice , but the food was not good at all. The drunken chicken nachos had to much going on. And the enchiladas have no taste, the rice is hard it's not Mexican at all.  But the worse part was when i got my "pi√±a colada" drink.  It tasted like old canned lemon. It was very acid not drinkable.  Don't spend your money here! It's not worth it. Sorry.
