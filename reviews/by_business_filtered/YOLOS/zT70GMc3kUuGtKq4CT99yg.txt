We were looking for a place that wasn't super expensive and Mexican food sounded good.  So we stumbled upon Yolos in Planet Hollywood via Yelp reviews.   It looked great and my husband and I both being vegetarians liked the looks of the veggie enchiladas and the veggie fajitas.  That's what we ordered. They were great!  I don't know what they do to their veggies but the spices are amazing.  The veggie fajitas were our favorite.  So good.  A little loud due to its proximity to the casino but hey, you're in Vegas.  We would go back. Plus $5 beers (tall ones!).
