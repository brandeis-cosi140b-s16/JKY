I've had Yayo Taco bookmarked for over a year and finally made it over there to sample the wares.
My husband is a UNLV student, so he got the $5 deal (still in effect March 2012 - 4 tacos, 2 sides, soda). I have no affiliation with UNLV, so I had to pay $7.50 for the same combo.
There are all kinds of different tacos - the standard chicken, carne asada, carnitas, etc, some 'fusion' style Asian ones, and probably 3 or 4 tofu ones. I really appreciated the variety and uniqueness of the offerings, the extensive beer list, and the 'college-ness' of the whole joint. Unfortunately, I did not like the taste of the tacos (I had chicken, carnitas, and carne asada). Sometimes, you know when you look at cheap ground meat and it kinda reminds you of dog food and you get a little grossed out, but try to put that thought out of your head and eat it anyway? Well at least that's what I do. And sometimes when that happens it turns out really good, but not with Yayo. Maybe it's just the low-price meat, or maybe it's too much oil, as other reviewers have noted, or maybe it's all in my head, but I couldn't finish my tacos. 
Sad....I wanted to love Yayo, but I'd really rather go to Chipotle (for about the same price).
