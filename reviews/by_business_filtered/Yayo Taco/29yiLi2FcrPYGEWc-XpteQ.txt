Last weekend we were in Vegas celebrating my twin cousins birthdays and decided to go off the stip for some tacos at Yayo Tacos that we saw on diners drive ins and dives. We got there super early to avoid a crowd and were the first people seated. After reviewing the menu we decided to all get the taco special which included four tacos and two sides for $10. Out of the tacos chosen the Shanghai was definitely was the best. The tacos and the sides were  large are very filling. Overall, the food and services was great! Definitely worth a 6 minute trip off the strip and it was nice to get out a the chaos we all experience at some point in Vegas:)
