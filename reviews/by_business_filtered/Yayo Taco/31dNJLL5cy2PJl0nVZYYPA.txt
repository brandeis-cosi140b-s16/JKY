Since my last review, I've been here quite often, so much that they know me on a first name basis. Which I kind of admire, because rarely (especially in Vegas) do I find owners make that effort. That deserves some recognition, right? That aside, I must say, their veggie taco has improved. No longer are the veggies slathered in oil, but it's sauteed enough to keep it firm and tasty. And it's topped with this curry like sauce, which is delicious. They offer plenty of outdoor seating when weather permits. So if you're near or at UNLV, make that trek, stop in, listen to great music, and enjoy a taco and brewski (preferably Sierra Nevada Pale Ale).
