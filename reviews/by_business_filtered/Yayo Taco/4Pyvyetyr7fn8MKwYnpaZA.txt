Flipping love this place!  Try the 4 taco combo...it comes with 4 street tacos of your choice, 2 sides and a drink.  Perfect for 2 people to split.  The whole meal cost about $10.  Really reasonable and the food is SO good!  

I've tried the Carne Asada...wonderful!  So tender and delicious!  The Texacano is definitely worth trying!  Again, so tender and delicious!  I've also tried their chicken curry option called the Bombay, which was good.  The Pollo is very good too.  Their chips and salsa are so tasty!  The chips and salsa taste and look homemade.  I haven't tried any other sides but am planning on it for my next visit!

I will without a doubt be back!
