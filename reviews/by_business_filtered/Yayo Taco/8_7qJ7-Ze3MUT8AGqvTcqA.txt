Two groups decided to go get a bite to eat since this was a Food Network must in Las Vegas. One group of four ordered three entrees. The other group of six ordered 6 entrees. We all ordered tacos. All came out one at a time increments of two to 10 minutes. Food wasn't to die for. I did like the Bombay taco. Don't get the refried beans. Horrible! Service was horrible and it wasn't busy. I would be scared to come here when college was in session. You would be waiting for hours! I don't think I will go back. One good thing, it was interesting venue.
