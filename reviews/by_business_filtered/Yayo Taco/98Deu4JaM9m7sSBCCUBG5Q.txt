I could see why the Food Network featured this place. It really does tailor to my preferences of a good time. Tacos, tequila, and brewskis! They have a WIDE selection of beer to offer, as well as a wide selection of tequila!

First, the food. I tried the Bombay taco (which I ordered a second round of), the Pescado, and the beer battered shrimp taco. The Bombay taco was BOMB.com. They should rename it Bomb.com taco...(bad joke. sorry.) It's a nice tender chicken taco drizzled with curry sauce. Super delicious with a nice amount of smack kick punch spice to it! The pescado was also good as well. A very nice and tender pollock fish with topped with guac and sour cream. A very traditional fish taco. The shrimp taco was also amazing! Huge shrimp pieces that don't even fit in the corn tortilla itself! The beer batter was sweet and crispy. Just the way I like it. Tacos there sell for $1.75 for the Classico or $2.25 each for the Loco. What a deal! 

Johnathan, was an awesome server. He's very fun and knowledgeable about his brews. I tried the Dogfish head 90 there, and if you're up for it, they have the Dogfish head 120 as well. We tried the Wyders which is good (but you can get that at your local convenient store). They had this nice Crispin apple cider that Anthony suggested which was really delicious. It was slightly sweet, but still very delectable. Definitely a good suggestion for someone who isn't a big beer drinker. 

I had a great experience, and I'm just mesmerized by the sections they have of everything there. They even have vegan offerings there for you to enjoy! They also have bands that play there as well, but aside from the knowledgeable tourists, the place tailors to mostly college students since its right across the street from the campus.
