I feel this is the best place for tacos and beer. Truely unique flavors.
I live in san Francisco and when I go to vegas I always hit up yayos for my Shanghai taco fix. Its like going to baja with a zen feel..i enjoy that hammock and artful walls too....love love love there food. 
Wish they had one in s.f.
Located across from unlv on maryland behind Einstein's bagel.
If they had ten stars I would give them 10.
