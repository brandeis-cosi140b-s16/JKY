Decided to come check this place out after seeing it on DD&D. So glad we did! Love the atmosphere, like everyone else, it def. reminds me of eating at the small mexican cantina's they have in Baja. I ordered the Camarones and the Pescado tacos. Both of them were delicious and the shrimp were huge! The Napa slaw on the pescado taco was tangy and went well with the sour cream. I also got a side of Ceviche... it was the freshest, most delicious ceviche I have had in awhile. My fave part of the food?  THE CHIPS!   they were crunchy and salty and had cilantro sprinkled over them... the best tortilla chips hands down.  They went perfectly with the ceviche.  My boyfriend ordered the Shanghai taco and I had a bite.  I didn't think anything wasabi would be good on a taco but this taco was amazing!  I wished I had ordered it myself.  He got 2 sides with it and chose the french fries and the chips N salsa(pico de gallo)  the french fries were good, but a little on the soggy side. 

I am so glad we found this place and I will def. be coming back. We got 5 tacos, 2 sides, ceviche and 2 drinks for under $16 so the prices are very fair. Esp. for the quality and the size of the tacos they give you. I will ignore the useless review from Alberto E. below. By the way he types his reviews I believe he would know what toilet water actually tastes like.  Stay classy my friends!
