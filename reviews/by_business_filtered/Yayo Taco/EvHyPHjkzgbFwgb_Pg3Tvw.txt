Are you kidding me, a "C" health rating!?!? Do you know what it takes to rate a C? The rats must be boinking the cockroaches on the raw chicken! Seriously though, you have to score more than 28 health violations to rate a C? Oh and you have to not care enough to do anything about it. For sure there are some health violations that are a little understandable: exit sign has to be X number of feet from the door, sanitizer location, etc.  Once the health inspector finds a few violations, you have 30 days to fix em... To get downgraded to a B! What did they find here? 

I'm sorry but anyone giving this place more than 1 star is a fool! The owner of this shit hole doesn't care about you, obviously. I also don't care if the food is tasty, it might make you sick or at the least have mouse shit in it. 

On a good note, there is a hammock there so when you get sick you can lie down until the EMT's get there.

Sorry to be so harsh but there is NOTHING worse than this. Not lumpy potatoes nor bad service. This is the worst thing a restaurant can be: Dangerous.

The tequila and beer selection is really, really good, the staff seems nice but for God's sake, fix your shit! The local channel 5 news even did an expos√© on this place on their "dirty dining" spot and they STILL don't clean it up. Booooooooo!

They raise their rating, I'd LOVE to come in a have a taco
