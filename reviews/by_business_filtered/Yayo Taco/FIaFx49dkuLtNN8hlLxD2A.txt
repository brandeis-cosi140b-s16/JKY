I think this place is pretty good for the price.  The quality of the meat is great but they just needed the extra kick in spice/seasoning. I felt like some of the tacos came out too soggy or mushy or something too.

$7.99 gives you a combo which comes w/ 4 tacos and 2 sides.  The sides I picked were double-salad which is all spinach. I enjoyed how they LOADED up each taco w/ meat btw.

-Carne asado tacos were good but the meat needed some extra flavor. If they had some hot sauce this thing would be awesome.  It was a bit mushy/soggy too
-Al Pastor tacos were good but the texture was over-the top mushy.  A bit too sweet too.  I still liked it tho.
-Shrimp tacos were a bit disappointing.  They were just fried fish w/ breading, in a taco on a huge lettuce leaf.  Wasn't a fan at all.
-Shanghai taco was pretty good.  I liked this one.

I like my tacos to be spicy and the items I ordered had almost no spice.  The hot sauce they offered wasn't to my liking either.

If they added a hot sauce station this place would be 4 stars easy.  Still - a solid A-OK place.
