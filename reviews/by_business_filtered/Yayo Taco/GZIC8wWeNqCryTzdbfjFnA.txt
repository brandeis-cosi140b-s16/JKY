It's hard for me whether to give this place three or four stars. My coworker's son had their band play here the night I was there. Upon first impression I wasn't entirely impressed, and to be honest the music really wasn't my scene. However, you can't beat what you get for the student special they have: your choice of 4 tacos (you can pick through items 1-5 on the menu), two sides (there's a good list of them), and drink (and the best part is tequila, margaritas, and beer is also added to this!!!)

I had the veggie tacos with rice, chips and salsa, and beer for my meal. The veggie tacos are actually pretty decent for what you get. The chips and salsa were a little small than usual, and the rice was A-OK. I enjoyed having my beer be part of the bill with my meal, which was $7 in total for *everything* I got (and honestly you really can't beat a deal like that). Did I mention they have a ridiculous selection of beers to choose from?! For a little hole in the wall taco shop like this, you're going to be caught off guard with how many selections they have!

While I found this place to be four stars at best (maybe even 3.5 if there was an option), I have to say the music scene here is 3 stars at best. I think its because the music is not really my scene (high school ska-ish rock), but I'll have to swing by here before the bands are headlining to enjoy the student special a little more.
