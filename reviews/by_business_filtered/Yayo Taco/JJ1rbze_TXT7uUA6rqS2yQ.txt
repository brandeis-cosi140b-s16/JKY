Great value, tastes fresh, but the tacos weren't as flavorful as I thought they looked. It might be from the hype i hears beforehand. I would come back & recommend them though. My 4 taco special was filling & gave me a food coma. Go outside what you know, because the unfamiliar taco choices I picked tastes better than the carne asada tacos. The place is tricky to find because it's behind a building called Rebel Books. They need a sign, but their theme is interesting. Lots of beers and tequila! Try it for yourself!
