The food here is great, a blend of Mexican dishes with spices from all over the world.  I get the taco combo special with 4 tacos and 2 side dishes.  The sides are just as great as the main dishes with plantain chips and sweet potato fries being my favorites.  They also have a lot of vegetarian and vegan friendly dishes if that's your thing.  

Don't forget the huge selection of micro brews and tequilas!
