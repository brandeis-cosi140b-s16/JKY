I like this place! Its a cute little dive joint thats open late (1am wed-sat) and sometimes has a band playing. A lot of UNLV students hang out here and it has a laid back easy going atmosphere.

If there is a band it can be very loud inside but I like the picnic table seating outside anyways on nice summer nights.

They have 4 vegetarian or vegan options... Plain veggies, veggies and tofu (Nuez), bbq style tofu (Fuma) and a wasabi type tofu.
The first time we went we did the 4 taco special and tried all the vegetarian tacos. My favorite is the Fuma.

We went again last week and I ordered a "veggie plate." Fuma tofu and veggies (just the filling, no corn tortilla), quinoa salad side and garlic onion pepper black bean side. It came out great all on a plate and was a good portion for me when Im trying to be low carb.

My husband ordered the fuma style burrito and I snuck a bite (yummy!). He also got a Yayo snow ball which is a small ice cream ball rolled in yummy crispy ingredients. Its small... like a ping pong ball.
The plantain chips and black bean dip is also good. The black bean dip is different from the garlic onion pepper black bean side. They add sugar and maybe something else cuz its sweet and more creamy.
Lots of beer and tequila choices...And the prices are reasonable! Will be back :)
