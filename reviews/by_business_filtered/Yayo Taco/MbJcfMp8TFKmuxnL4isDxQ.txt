I first heard about this place when it was featured in an episode of triple D (Diners Drive-Ins and Dives). 

The blend of Mexican meets Asian looked and sounded delicious on TV, so we had to go check it out - and it did not disappoint. 

The Carne Asada and the Carnitas are both very good. The Tofu Nues is surprisingly delicious, and you don't miss meat at all when you bite in to one of those tasty treats! The sides of fresh fried chips and salsa are yummy, and go down fast. 

Yayo's is very casual, and the prices are cheap - especially compared to the quality tasting food you get. Great value for money!
