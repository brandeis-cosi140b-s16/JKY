Stopped in here for lunch today.

The place definitely looks like a dive- all the wooden tables and chairs have writing all over. The restaurant was clean, however. They also offer outdoor dining, which can be awkward as people walk through and try to get spare change off of you while you eat.

The employees there were really nice. This place doesn't appear to be run by Mexican guys- more like white dudes who like to eat really greasy food. 

The food was good. The chips were delicious and came with fresh pico de gallo. I enjoyed the pinto beans as well, but there was nothing particularly special about them. I tried the carne asada taco, the ground beef taco, the chicken, and the roast pork. The tacos are about 90% meat, which is really awesome if you're into that. They also have vegetarian tacos for those who do not partake.

The thing about the tacos is that they were really really greasy. Like, dripped down my arm and face greasy. Be forewarned, and use lots of napkins. I also expected the meat to have more flavor. While the meat in all the tacos was perfectly tender, I thought it would be flavored more with spices or sauce. While this allowed me to really taste the flavor of the meat, I do enjoy mexican flavors in my taco meat as well.

I did not try any of the beers and tequilas. Over all, this place was good. Extremely cheap (5.40 for the student special!), and the food was decent. I enjoyed it very much. I have a feeling this place would even be better if I was drinking- nothing like greasy tacos to soak up tequila!
