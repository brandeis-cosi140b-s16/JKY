This is the best restaurant in Las Vegas. Amazing vegetarian options, and a really chill vibe. Free foosball. Killer ambiance. Cheap. Tacos for $1.75, drinks $5.75

The food was AMAZING. 

Jonathan, a server here, is the best. He'll help you pick your food, he understands cilantro allergies and best of all his tequila recommendations are out of this world!
