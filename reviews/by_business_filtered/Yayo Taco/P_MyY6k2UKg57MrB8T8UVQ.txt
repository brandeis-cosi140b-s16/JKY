YaYo. Fun to dine, fun to drink, fun to say.

The carnitas is the best.  It's braised all day like it should be. The owner told me the Clinton campaign people used to come in when they were in town for the primaries in 2008, because their headquarters were nearby; they would all order the carnitas until it was gone, because they heart it so much.

Also, the quinoa salad and tortilla chips are my favorite sides to get.  Yayo's must be the only cheap place where you can order quinoa right now.
