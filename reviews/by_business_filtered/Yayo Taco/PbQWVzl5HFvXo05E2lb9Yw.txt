Live music. Over 100 different kinds of tequila. Killer beer selection with prices that beat the Frog. Awesome frakkin tacos and chili. Its all at Yayo Taco across from the university! Its the best place you either haven't been to yet or haven't gone to enough! Diversity is the theme and it works all day everyday (except most sundays of course).
