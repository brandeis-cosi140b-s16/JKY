It's a great Venue to have an event or party. I just DJed (The Patriot Act) there tonight  and it was raging. We moved the tables outside to make a patio type thing and a large dance floor. Everyone was going crazy and you can setup for beer pong too if you have less people. It really is an awesome place to throw an event.
