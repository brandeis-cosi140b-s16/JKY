I've gone to several Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives restaurants. Yayo Taco is the first place I can truly say was a "dive". That's not a bad thing because the atmosphere was fun. Wish I could be there on a Friday night with UNLV in session.

I had three tacos (Pollo, Carne Asada, and Bombay.) The Pollo was amazing and I could have eaten several more. The Carne Asada was tasty with a little bit too much spice for my taste. And I'll skip the Bombay next time. Amazing selection of beers, which I tried, and tequilas, which I did not.
