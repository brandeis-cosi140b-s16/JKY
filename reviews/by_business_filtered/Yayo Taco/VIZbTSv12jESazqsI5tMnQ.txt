A little hard to find. We drive around for a good 10 min lol I'm from LA and the only reason I usually come to Vegas is to party but we made it out here early this trip and wanted to try this place out. Tacos were amazing! Big beer and tequila selection! So glad I was able to make it out here to try this amazing food!
