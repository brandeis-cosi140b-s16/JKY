I thought I'd never find a cheap place in Vegas. But, oh my gawd, did I find one really!? Yayo Taco is the bomb! $1.75 to $2.25 tacos with a lot of tasty goodness overflowing in your mouth. If you happen to be in Vegas, be sure to visit this joint just to have a taste of why I'm so excited about it. It's near the strip, just take a cab ride. Come on, you can do it! You must try their Bombay Taco and Shanghai Taco. It's oh so good to the very last bite. (Don't bite your fingers! The sauce drips.) I also tried their Pastor Taco and Carne Asada Taco. They were on the spot delicious in everything! Who cares if the place looks like a dive bar?! It is a dive bar! The food tasted awesome and they have a whole page list of beers. Go international! Drink it with a great taco! This is my second flavortownusa-hop. I haven't been disappointed. I'll always pass by this place when in Vegas.
