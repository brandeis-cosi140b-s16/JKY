This place is a total fad. Food sucks, its run by WHITE HIPPIES. People who eat here dont know anything about good food. The guy working there isnt friendly and the whole place is full of hippies. It also stinks like weed and there is a ton of underage drinking. Its really lame. So many more good taco shops besides this one. The Chicken tacos are garbage too. They taste like some middle eastern dish dumped in tiny corn tortillas. Really bad. 

It reminds me of being in San Francisco in one of the old hippie areas. Its really bad. Also... TOFU TACOS?? Fail... Thats not mexican, its a bastardization of what mexican food is. This isnt fusion, its a joke.
