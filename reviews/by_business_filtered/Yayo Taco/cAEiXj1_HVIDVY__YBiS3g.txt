Been recently to Yayo Taco on Maryland behind UNLV. I can best describe the place as a taqueria with a bit of Asian fusion thrown in the mix. Prices are fairly good, considering their target crowd are college folks. As far as flavor is concerned, Yayo Tacos didn't disappoint. We tried their taco platter samplers (1&2) which included carnitas, texano, bombay and shanghai variants as well as their carne asada cheese fries and chicken quesadilla with sweet tater sides. Location is a easy to miss without a top mounted signage and the restaurant interior is a sure conversational piece by itself. Caveat: Mexican taco purists might find the added fusion flavors off-putting or just downright weird--we certainly did not.
