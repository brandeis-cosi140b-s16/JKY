I love Yayo's for the food, the craft beer, and the atmosphere.  

Obviously a college Taco joint, Yayo's has sooo many tasty options!  And the options are inventive.  I order as many things as possible when I'm here, just to try different meats and sauces.  Bombay, asada, pastor, veggie!  ...and I get to pair them with outstanding craft beer...okay, i'm in!

First came here to watch a friends band play on a Friday night...now I stop by whenever I'm in the area and even remotely hungry.  I even came here to eat two tacos before going to meet some friends for dinner in the area one time.

I think this is my favorite place in Vegas for tacos...if not, it's certainly one of the best!
