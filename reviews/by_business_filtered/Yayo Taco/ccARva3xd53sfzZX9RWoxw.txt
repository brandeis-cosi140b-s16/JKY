3.5 stars. Yayo Taco is more than just your average taqueria, and it's another reason to venture outside the student union when it comes to dining. The vibe definitely caters to the college and happy hour crowd. They have an awesome UNLV and CSN special: 4 classic tacos, 2 sides, and a drink for $5. Their list of beers and tequila is surprisingly quite long. A perfect pair with these delicious tacos. I liked that it had fusion tacos that was influenced by different cultures. My personal favorite is the Bombay taco. It's a roasted chicken taco with green curry and mint. If you have a sense of trepidation, no fear, they have the usual carne asada, pollo, carnitas, and fish tacos. Vegetarians are catered as well, offering veggie and tofu tacos. So you can totally bring your hippie-Trader Joe loving friend.

Downside? I hate to say it, but their sides disappointed me. I liked that they offered different side dishes such as salad and quinoa, but my sweet potato fries were thin and overcooked. My quinoa salad was tasty and had good texture, but it saddened me that the portion was kinda small. I should have stuck to beans and chips. Wait time kinda felt long: 25 minutes. It was probably because of the family ahead of me ordered a feast.

Interior decor might cause split opinion. It doesn't have that slick and shiny look of Chipotle, but it has character, which I totally appreciate. The people working were very friendly and offered me their special hot sauce, which did not disappoint. One of the workers, Alejandro, was very cool. He told me about jazz nights and let me take some menus.(Which I will post). Nice staff (called me by my first name) and good tacos made me a fan. Now only if they improved those sweet potato fries.
