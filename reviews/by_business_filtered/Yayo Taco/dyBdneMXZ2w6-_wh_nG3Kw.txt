Seriously?! Saw this on food network, so we thought we'd give it a try. That was the wrong decision. Horrible food. The tacos had no flavor. Honestly, I could get better tacos from the taco trucks back home in Los Angeles. Had stomach pains after as well. Don't waste your time for less than mediocre food.
