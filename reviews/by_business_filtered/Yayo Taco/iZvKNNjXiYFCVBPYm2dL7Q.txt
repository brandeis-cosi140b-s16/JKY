This place was on triple D. One of the best tequila line ups I have seen and their beer selection is off the charts. I got the 4 taco sampler with plantains and chips and salsa. Also got a Mexican coke, in a glass bottle (the only way to have a coke).  Service was prompt and everyone was nice. It was a Tuesday night and a little slow.  There was a live band with a jazz flute. Nice touch.
