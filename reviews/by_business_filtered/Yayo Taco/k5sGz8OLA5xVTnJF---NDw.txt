This place is alright.  While the 5 dollar student special is certainly a good deal for the amount of food you get, this is a case where it's quantity over quality.  The tacos are okay.  The fish taco and the shrimp tacos are good (which, btw, is a problem, since they charge you more to have these items, defeating the point of the student special), but I've tried so very hard to like the carne asada and the various chicken tacos they have on their menu, and I just am not into it.  The sauces that they use for both their carne asada and their chicken tacos is kinda nasty.  The steak is generally greasy, and there's just something off about it.  I always tell them easy on the sauce now, which makes it better, but they are definitely not my favorite tacos.

Their sides are pretty good.  I like their black beans and the rice.  Their fries are also good.  However, their sweet potato fries are freakin' nasty.  And I've gone there several times to be told that the rice "isn't ready".  Who the hell has a taco place and doesn't have rice?!?  Really, people.  Plus, if it's lunchtime, your rice should probably be ready.

Howeverrrr.... All of this said, I'm kind of squeamish about eating there now, since this place was on dirty dining somewhat recently.  :-/
