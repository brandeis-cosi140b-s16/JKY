I like to refer to Cho, the owner and Chef, as my favorite anomaly. He's of Chinese descent, cooks Mexican Cuisine, and plays country music. He's likes for his spot to be incognito- and if you get there early enough, you'll have a chance to maybe take a shot of tequila with him!

There is years of world-travelled-surfer, inspired food here. He's soaked up recipes from all over Indonesia and Australia as well many other countries and this knowledge and love for food truely shows up in his cooking.

Weather it's the insane TOFU NUEZ tacos, which even a tofu hater will surley love or the CHICKEN MOLE tacos with 21 ingredients in the sauce alone, or the 100 different Tequilas and 100 species of brew...

ANYTIME I'm on the east side...I make it a point to come here. To call it a taco shop is a gross understatement. 

Love this place.
