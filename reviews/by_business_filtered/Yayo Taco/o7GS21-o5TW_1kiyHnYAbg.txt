Wow am I efficient or what? I literally just got back from lunch at Yayo today and am already here typing my notes up! I am quite proud of myself. 

So I decided to try this place out the moment I read reviews about it having TOFU TACOS. Not one or two but THREE tofu tacos on their menu. Now, tofu on anything is my weakness. I just adore tofu...soft, firm, fried, baked...ANYWAY....some people may gag at the mere mention of tofu but I salivate. 

The fact that Yayos had tofu tacos was enough to make me drive 30 min in the 110 degree weather on a weekday for my tofu fix. From this lengthy introduction you can tell that I REALLY wanted to like Yayo. 

I went with 2 friends (one veggie and one omnivore). All of us ordered the special : 4 tacos, 2 sides and a drink for $8 ($5 for UNLV card holders and $.50 extra per specialty taco...the tofu tacos are specialty tacos). My plate came with:

1. Tofu Nuez Taco (x2)
2. Tofu Adobo Taco
3. Tofu Fuma Taco

General consensus on tacos: I don't like corn tortillas and these guys don't have an option of flour. So I concentrated on eating the insides. The sauces were pretty good and the tofu seemed like fried tofu puffs. It was actually good. My only complaints are that the quantity of tofu was pretty small and all the tacos tasted pretty much the same. So I had 4 tacos that tasted like each other. 

4. Sweet Potato Fries - seemed burnt. But I will devour all fries nevertheles

5. Black Beans - Umm...not much to say. Tasted like black beans. 

The place itself was pretty cool - definitely geared towards the college crowd so it brought back some fun memories. The people at the counter were friendly. I'd probably come back again just because getting any sort of vegetarian Mexican food is pretty tough so I'm gonna take what I get. 

Yayo has the potential to be so much better. I don't mind if they charged me more to fill up the tacos a bit more and offered flour tortillas.
