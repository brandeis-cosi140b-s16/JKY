We had an awesome experience!  The Tacos are to die for...  Jonathan was a great help to us in ordering what we wanted.  He also checked in with us after we received our order to see if we liked everything.  ABSOLUTELY!  Best tacos we have ever had bar none!!!  They take great pride in marinating all of their pork, chicken and beef, and the unusual mix of ingredients will have you begging for more.  And... have a great selection of sides to choose from. You can't go wrong when Guy Fieri from Diners, Drive-ins and Dives shows up and loves the place...!  Oh, and did we mention the beer and tequila selection is mind boggling.  It literally covers the entire back page of their 8 x 14 size menu.  You have to check this place out!!!
