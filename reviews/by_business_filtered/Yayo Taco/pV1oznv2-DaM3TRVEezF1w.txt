My wife saw this place featured on DD&D and was excited to check it out. We were very disappointed. We should have gotten the hint when a customer before us demanded his money back because his food looked like crap, which it did. But we thought it was an isolated case. The service wasn't great but that can be chalked up to the cashier being new. When it came time to pick our sides, our choices were limited because they ran out of half of their choices. And this was at 3:00 pm on Saturday. The tacos were okay. I had the Shanghai and Camorones, curry style. They were okay but not DD&D quality. The atmosphere was very shady. The place was dark and dirty. An adult bookstore has more charm to this place... or so I heard since I have never been in one...

2 Stars...JUSTICE HAS BEEN SERVED!!
