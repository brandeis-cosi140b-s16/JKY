Yesterday For lunch I tried their carnitas, shanghai, and texano tacos locos. All good, but I would say carnitas were my favorite. The fries were fresh cut and not the slightest bit greasy. Cool atmosphere and great bottled beer selection...the only negative is, where were places like this when I was in college!?!

Great atmosphere, food, and PRICE!
