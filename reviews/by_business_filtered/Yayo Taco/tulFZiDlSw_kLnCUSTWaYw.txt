I think what Yayo Taco offers best is ambiance - it's amazing how quick you can go from high-strung college day to lazing around on the couches with a really great vegan taco. Of course, it could not accomplish that with a really, really great taco, either - even the taco-newbie in me wanted to go for seconds, and definitely would have if it wasn't for the collective sofa-round heart-to-heart we were too preoccupied with to bother trying to look for a new menu.

There are a lot of taco options, varied in ethnic style, ingredients, heaviness, and price. Although I can't quite say there'd be something for everyone in there, since some of us still did struggle to decide on a taco, there really is a lot more than you'd expect, and even the Asian-flavor tacos are good without just playing the cutting-edge fusion card. The affordable price will appeal to college students as well.

I think this review hovers more around a 3.5, but then I too vividly remember how much we struggled to try to find the menu to put in a second set of orders, that the tacos must have been really, really good. 4 stars for now and a pending revisit, it is.
