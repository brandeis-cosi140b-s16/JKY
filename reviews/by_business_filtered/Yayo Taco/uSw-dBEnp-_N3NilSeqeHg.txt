I live around the corner, so Yayo is one of our frequent walk-to places.  I would have said the artisan tacos are 3-4 stars, but I recently discovered the nachos - which rocketed my rating up to 5 stars.  The chips stay crunchy and look like they're made in-house instead of dumped from a bag.  Ground beef #2 is my favorite!

Two things annoy me however ... When I asked what comes on the $4.50 nachos, the cashier listed of a ton of stuff (cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, rice, guac, black or pinto beans, and your choice of taco meat, etc) so I said, "Cool -- I'll take everything!" and my bill came to $8.  He didn't say all that stuff was additional cost!  *frown*  It tasted great, so I got over it.

Second, the $5 student lunch special is jive since I bring friends there all the time and we deserve a cheap lunch too.  Why do non-students have to pay an extra $2.50 for lunch?  I don't like being discriminated against cuz I already graduated.  :-P
