Wait, am I in Cabo?  This is deja vu of my Cabo trip back in my college days....it's a replica of the cantinas around Cabo, Rosarito etc....wood furniture, graffiti on the wall, surfboards on the ceiling. So I start looking over the menu, $1.75-2.25 a taco? Wait, what? Is this a joke? Am I really in Mexico? I almost feel like that old joke like I should go outside and look for stray dogs and cats because clearly something isn't right here, how can it be? My friend ordered the 4 taco combo with a side, I ordered one taco and chips & salsa and plantains, 2 drinks our total came to $16. I'm dying, these tacos have to be terrible. To my surprise, my shanghai taco was pretty good, my chips were so fresh, but my only complaint is the "salsa" was actually pico de gallo, so a little disappointed. Our plantains were a delicious end, cinnamon and condensed milk drizzle over them. They have insane amount of craft beers, and any friend of Chimay is a friend of mine. Also 2 pages of tequila. 

The crowd was quite, um eclectic? I believe they had a band playing later that night, if you didn't take a shower for a week, no one would notice, and I believe that's the story with the fella that took up residence next to me. 

Don't get me wrong, this isn't the best food I've had and it's not fine dining, so it kinda makes me laugh at some of the harsh reviews, I mean, come on people, $1.75 a taco? I can totally see why this is a popular spot for UNLV students. Kinda makes me want to go back for my masters, uh wait, nope nevermind, the moment passed.
