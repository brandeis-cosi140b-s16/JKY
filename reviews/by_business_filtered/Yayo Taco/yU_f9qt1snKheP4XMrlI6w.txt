I heard a lot about this place so I had to try it. Very cool atmosphere typical for a place for college kids but I will have to tell you wasn't all that impressed with food. I have had better tacos from the local taco wagon around the area. The fish tacos I found to be very bland they do have a good selection of beer service is great here very friendly too sum this review up. cheap eats for college kids good beer and good service
