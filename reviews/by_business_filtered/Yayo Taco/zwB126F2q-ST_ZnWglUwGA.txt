I saw this place on triple D and was eager to try it out. I am visiting from San Diego and came in with my entire family. Let me start off by saying I will never be back due to their shady ways. I ordered the nachos (priced at $4.25) and the taco combo which comes with 4 tacos and 2 sides (priced at $7.75). The cashier, Miguel tells me the total is $23. It didn't sound right but I paid and sat down at one of the tables. It was then that it hit me that my bill should have been $13/14. I bring it to Miguel's attention and he tells me, "we will get it taken care of." I have no idea what that means so we finish eating and I return to the counter to collect the cash I was overcharged!

Miguel asks me to speak with Jaime who I assume is a manager. Jaime looks at the receipt and hands me a $1.25. He tells me that each taco was an additional 50 cents because they were not part of the special! He then tells me the nachos that were listed at $4.25 were an additional 4 dollars because I added meat, sour cream and guacamole. My response, "Why wasn't I given all this info when I ordered." He said he was sorry but there wasn't anything he could do. I asked him if I could speak with the manager and he told me he was the manager. This was the worst customer service I have ever experienced!!! Frustrated like hell, We just left!

As for the food, nachos were average at best. Carnitas tacos were decent but nothing special. Don't waste your time with this place. They obviously went above and beyond for triple D but don't treat regular customers with the same respect!!!!!
