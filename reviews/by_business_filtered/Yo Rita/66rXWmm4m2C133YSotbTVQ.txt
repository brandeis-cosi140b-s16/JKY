Short answer: Will be back for cocktails, not for food.

Service - 
Host - asked to be seated at an empty table next to a group of friends.  Was told "No, can't do that, we might have a big party come in."  This is despite the fact the entire back section as open and easily could have accommodated such a party. (I've worked as a hostess in the past - not just blowing smoke.)  Bad way to start.

Waiter - Adequate, but not friendly or personable - just phoning it in.  Meh.

Food - Bland and lukewarm by the time in hit the table. (The restaurant wasn't that full at this point, so really, my expectations are this should have come out at least a little warm...it's not like they were slammed).  Nothing to write home about.

Ambiance - The light from the Men's bathroom is really bright compared to the ambient light in the restaurant, so each time the door opened, our group got blinded.  Furthermore, given the price of the food the amount of sauces that are served with it, cloth napkins may be better than paper. (It just feels cheap).

Drinks - The drinks were great.  I got the blood-orange margarita (delicious) and my friend got the Russian Mule - both were delicious!

Thanks.
