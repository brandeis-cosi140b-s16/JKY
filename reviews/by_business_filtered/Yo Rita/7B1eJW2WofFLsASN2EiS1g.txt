I had heard mixed reviews so I came in last night to make my mind up for myself. My first impression was not a good one - our waitress was not well versed in the offerings and was rather abrupt with us. The chips were way too salty (and I didn't know such a thing was possible before tonight!). My wine was pour generously but wasn't particularly good. But despite this less than impressive start, I did love the grits and the tacos. The grits had a little bit of black bean dip and a red sauce that may have had a hint of tabasco. They had the perfect amount a butter and were delicious! I had the Crispy Artichoke taco and the Santa Cruz Fish Taco. It was nice to try something a little different, and they did a great job pairing the tacos with additional toppings to compliment the flavors. I definitely want to try a few other tacos, but I think I will see if I can order take-out next time.
