People need to stop complaining about the portion size.  Tacos are a street food you eat on the go, not those deep fried abominations Americans seem to be so fond of.  Two/three tacos with chips and salsa is plenty for any normal sized human.

So far, this is my favorite taco place in Pittsburgh.  The second runner up was Round Corner Cantina.  While both are good, the bolder flavors of YR wins out.

We went on a Tuesday night.  It was crowded but not unmanageable. We hung out at the bar while we waited for our table.  I had the ODB with gin.  There was a smidge too much pickle juice, but I enjoyed it.  Unfortunately  I can't drink Tequila so I was not able to have the more taco appropriate cocktails.  The Moscow Mule was a big punch of sunshine.  

The chips and salsa were good.  Finally, a place in this town that serves something resembling a good salsa!
The boyfriend and I split the asparagus taco, the pork belly and the duck taco.  The were a little larger than an average street taco and the fillings were plentiful.  I wish they had been corn tortillas rather than flour, but that didn't take away from the overall flavor.

Yes, for Pittsburgh the tacos are a bit expensive.  This is more of a "sometimes" restaurant than a "often" restaurant because of the price.  I very much look forward to going back and eating my way through the rest of the menu.
