I've always believed the best restaurants keep it simple. Do just a few things, but do them exceptionally well. Yo Rita is a great example of this. 

We walked in around 8 without reservations and were seated shortly after ordering cocktails at the bar. Our waitress immediately brought over some complementary fresh tortilla chips along with two different salsas (spicy and mild), and presented us with the daily specials. 

Yo Rita's menu is very simple, featuring a daily ceviche, soup and taco, among a short selection of everyday items consisting mostly of tacos. 

We ordered the ceviche to share (which happened to be shrimp), plus a tortilla soup and taco each. She ordered the special monkfish taco and I had the pork shoulder taco with mole and granny smith apples. 

Everything was outstanding including the service. Dinner for the two of us ran about $50 plus tip (including the cocktails). 

Overall we thought this was one of the best dining experiences we've had in a very long time.
