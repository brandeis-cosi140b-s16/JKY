The decor is very trendy and has a nice atmosphere. I got an arebas taco, which was a special, and an oyster po boy. The oyster po boy just didn't hit it for me. The oysters seemed to have too much breading and didn't even taste or feel the oysters.  I do miss those po boys down in the gulf coast tho. The arebas taco on the other hand was superb. Very good.
