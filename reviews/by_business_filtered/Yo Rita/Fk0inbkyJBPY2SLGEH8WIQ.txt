Very creative menu and delicious food. You have to be open minded when eating here especially if you are used to Pittsburgh bar food. This place has stepped it up with their unique idea of taco ingredients. All their tacos are delicious. My favorite is the chorizo taco and strip steak. I also had the mushroom soup. Very tasty and beautiful presentation. Now lets talk about the important stuff...cocktails :) the festini was delicious. Absolute wild tea with peach pur√©e and mint. It tasted like a peach mojito. My favorite. 
If you knew this place when it was still called the iguana grill, I hope you agree with me that this place has totally stepped it up to the next level. Swanky decor and dim lighting. Great for dates or dinner and drinks with your friends. My only gripes are the seats. The chairs and bar stools are not very comfortable. Mine was a bit uneven and would teeter as I moved. Also their draft beer list is very limited, but they do have an extensive tequila menu!
