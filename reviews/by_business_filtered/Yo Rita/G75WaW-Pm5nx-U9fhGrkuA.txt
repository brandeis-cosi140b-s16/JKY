For the longest time I thought this was a tattoo shop.  Since I'm not tatted up, I never ventured into Yo Rita's.  Once I learned it had tacos, I had to try it.

The bar/restaurant is on the smaller side and decor came straight from the Ikea catalog.  The taco list got me excited - I'm a sucker for a yummy or gourmet taco.  The tortilla chips and homemade salsa were delivered to the table.  Fresh chips and tasty (but mild) salsa... hey at least it was free?  

After ordering a brew, we heard the specials.  I opted to try the watermelon gazpacho, but what I got didn't impress.  It tasted more like cold tomato soup than watermelon gazpacho.  I thought it would be cool and light... my stomach was unhappy with this selection.

The tacos here sound really cool - "Santa Cruz Style Fish Taco" and "Chorizo Taco" were my selections.  Please keep in mind - these aren't dishes.  These are individual tacos.  They weren't large.  They weren't PACKED with awesomeness... they were just OK.  I will say the Chorizo Taco tasted like breakfast - chorizo sausage, maple glaze, topped with a sunny side up egg (mine was not very runny unfortunately).  Not bad, but not worth the $7 price tag.  I was less impressed with the Fish Taco - it was ... flavorless.  What happened to spice and seasoning you normally get with tacos or Mexican food, in general?  I want some FLAVA, Yo!!

After balancing out the pros and cons, I settled with a 3.  I had a decent beer, food was ok, chips and salsa were tasty and fresh... but I was left feeling "meh."  If you're hungry, I'd venture somewhere else... with single tacos costing $6-$9, you might as well venture down Carson Street a bit further.

I'm out, Yo.
