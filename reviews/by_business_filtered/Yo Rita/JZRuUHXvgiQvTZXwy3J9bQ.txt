Ay yo that carne asada taco is BAAAANGIN (A+ marinade and so tender). I thoroughly enjoyed the fish taco as well. Everyone on the double date just got 2 tacos, but deep in my heart I wanted to try every taco on that menu. The mango margarita was delightful and the table chips & salsa is actually pretty yummy and not boring.

Could be thought of as pricey, but the quality was there and noted. If you want a $3 taco, go find a food truck. It's a trendy spot, but ain't nothin wrong with that. I got my eye on the chorizo taco for next time.
