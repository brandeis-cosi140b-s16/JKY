Yo Rita serves up creative, flavorful upscale soft tacos with unexpected but harmonious flavor combinations in a stark yet comfortably casual atmosphere.  

We started off with two cocktails from their brief but playful cocktail menu.  I had the Ginger Lime Margarita, and my date had the Moscow Mule, a spicy concoction of Ginger Beer, lime juice, and vodka.  Yum.

Right after we were seated we eagerly sampled the complimentary tortilla chips with mild and spicy salsa, both of which were good.  

The tacos - priced at between about $4 and $10 each - are fairly small so we ordered the ceviche plus three tacos and split them between the two of us, and we were pleasantly full at the end of the meal (my date says he felt "stuffed").  

We ordered the ceviche of the day appetizer, which turned out to be a brightly flavorful contrast between the mildness of the fish and the spicy marinade, which was lime, cilantro, and spicy chili.  

For the main course we enjoyed the potato taco with crimini mushrooms, leeks, and manchego.  Delicious little diced, fried potatoes and the mushrooms and cheese made for a nice little savory taco.  The black-eyed pea taco was nice, with curry, garbanzos, spinach, and cucumber raita.  

The duck confit taco was by far the favorite - the mole sauce gave it a great smoky flavor, and what made these really stand out were the toasted almonds which added a wonderful crunchiness and sweetness to each bite.

Parking near Carson Street was a bit of a challenge, but we snagged a street parking spot nearby after a few minutes of searching.  

On a Saturday evening at 7:15, we walked in and got the last available table for two.  By 7:30, the entire place was packed and we would have had to wait for a while to be seated.  

Bottom line: Yo Rita served up outstanding creative tacos and great cocktails with an interesting atmosphere and efficient service.
