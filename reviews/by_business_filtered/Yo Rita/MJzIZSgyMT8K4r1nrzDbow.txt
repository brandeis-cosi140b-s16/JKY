A rainy evening a couple of weekends ago, my group of friends dropped into Yo Rita for a late Saturday evening dinner before dodging the crazies in the Southside bars. First off, this place is super cute, and you wouldn't know that necessarily from the frosted front windows. Dim lighting, candles, lounge-y electronic music, and a sleek set-up make it a very low-key but chic place to go out. Secondly, their menu is primarily set on one of two things: drinks, primarily margaritas, and tacos. But these aren't your average Chipotle tacos. These are GOURMET NIRVANA tacos. I ordered the flank steak and shredded chicken tacos and they were the best tacos I have had in my life. It was a smart call making a restaurant cater to 2 specialties, and they got them down pretty well. In addition, their margaritas were also a treat. I had a ginger lime margarita (more like, 2) mostly because I could barely taste the alcohol. My girlfriends had the classic margarita, but I saw many other mojito/margaritas on the menu, so next time I come back in the next month or so, I will be ordering something different. Overall, if you want to have an a-typical gastrotrip in Pittsburgh, I highly recommend Yo Rita.
