Visited Yo Rita with a couple friends.  We all had Tacos, 8 between the 3 of us.  They were all interesting and good.  The Black Eye Pea, Braised Chicken, and Steak were my favorites.  We also tried the Calamari, Bahn Mi, Escolar, Morcilla and Freshwater Eel, which were more of an acquired taste but still good.  For drinks we had the Traditional margarita and the Absinthe margarita.  Traditional was very good, Absinthe will warm you up but is a bit heavy on the Absinthe taste.  Decor was minimalistic, room temperature was comfortable, and music was at a good level for conversation.  Service was excellent.  I'd like to see the menu expanded.
