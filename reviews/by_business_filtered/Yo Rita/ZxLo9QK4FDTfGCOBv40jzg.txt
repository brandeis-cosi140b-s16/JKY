Unpleasant dining experience and laughable portions for the price. 

I love a good taco and I love margaritas. Nothing can spoil them for me but man if this place didn't really try. The taco prices are crazy steep as others have mentioned and unless you get three or four you will be hungry and mad. 

Worse than that is the owner. If you see a tall blonde woman standing at the bar looking angry at life that's her. She was repeatedly rude to us for being in the way despite the fact we were sitting in the bar stools. When our table was ready she yelled at us to go sit while we were trying to pay our bar tab. I had seen others mention her and didn't really believe it but good lord why would someone who is clearly so hateful of customers run a restaurant in a hands on manner? 

Cannot in good faith give her any money.
