Wow!  Blue marlin ceviche with fennel and pineapple was phenomenal.  Oyster Po' boy taco was crispy and delicious, and the spicy gazpacho was silky smooth.  My daughter is vegetarian, and she thought that both the summer corn taco and the eggplant taco were really great.  I've been to yo Rita 3 times now, and it's always great.

Returned on march 19 (Monday night so it wasn't crowded).  Food and service were again excellent - particularly the ahi tuna taco.  Other reviews neglect to mention that you get a basket of perfectly salted chips with both a mild and hot salsa to start.  With this, three tacos are plenty, and I have a big appetite.
