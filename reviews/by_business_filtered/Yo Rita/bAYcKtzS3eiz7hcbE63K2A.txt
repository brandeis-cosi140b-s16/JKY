This was my first experience with high end tacos, and it definitely set the bar high.  First off, I was in love with the free chips and salsa that they set out as you sit down.  The chips were delicious, and I am hoping they were homemade.  If not, I want to know where they bought them.

The bison meatballs we got were pretty good, but honestly I wouldn't waste your money or space in your stomach: save it all for the tacos.

With that being said, I loved my tacos.  Of course, I got the most expensive ones, so I do not know if their other lesser tacos are as good, but the Duck pastrami and the Seared Tuna were fabulous.  The toppings that accompanied each were perfect for the combination.  I have to say, that was 18 dollars well spent.

Next time I go, I may have to try some of the lesser expensive combos, because anything that has Seared Tuna and Duck is automatically going to be a 5-star.
