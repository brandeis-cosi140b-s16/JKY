I was in town visiting the fam.  My seester took me here on a Saturday night, after at least a year of hearing her rave about it.   

We did some drinks, some complementary chippy, and some tacos.  She had the Eel, I had the salmon and the crispy eggplant. All were delish.  (There was some crazy caramelized onion going on with the eel that I did not expect when I took a nibble.  Yummm)  Conversely, I was kind of weirded out by the use of trailer-trash snacks in their food.  (Cool Ranch Doritoes?  Andy Capp Hot Fries with my eggplant??  Maybe I'm not foodie enough for this place but ooookkkaaayyyy...I suppose it worked?)

I would go back and sit at the bar with a fancy margarita and a couple of the appetizers that I did not have the stomach capacity to try.
