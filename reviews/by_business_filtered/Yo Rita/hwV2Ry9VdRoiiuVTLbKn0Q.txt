I've been here twice and it's safe to say that I'm a fan.   I was in the mood for a margarita first and foremost so I was super please with the spicy "la diabla" one that I received- it was very extremely flavorful and quite strong!  (Not all all like the margaritas that you can just taste the store bought mix- thank God).   The tacos are good and growing on me (pork shoulder and bbq chix are awesome). So far I've only had one that I wasn't a big fan of, but that's because I didn't use the handy translation section on page 3 so I ordered something outside of my comfort zone- opps, my bad!  Overall, quaint place with a modern, good vibe that is somewhat rare in Pittsburgh :)   You know it's gotta be good if you see your favorite bartender from the down the street eating there too!
