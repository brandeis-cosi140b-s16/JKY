Love this place. A bit expensive for what you may think are just tacos, but they are oh so tasty and worth every penny. The menu is kept up to date but provides some standard staples, including the chorizo taco (comes with an egg). 

The soups are great and so are the drinks. The staff could be friendlier but don't let that keep you away.
