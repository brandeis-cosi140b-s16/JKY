Great for cocktails!

I will say, I was under the impression that this is a full-fledged Mexican restaurant. However, it is not. I would describe it as a niche bar (with kick-ass cocktails), that also happens to serve $9 tacos (and a couple apps for around the same price) if you get some drunk munchies.

The tacos were very good. I enjoyed the fish taco very much ... although hardly worth going back for at $9.

And according to my friend, if we want to solve the salt shortage, look no further than their veal taco. She seemed to wince in pain over its saltiness. Didn't try that one, but all of the tacos sounded good and interesting, although I probably won't be going back and paying so much for them. Tacos are supposed to be the people's food! 

We did all love our cocktails though. I had the blood orange margarita, which had the perfect amount of jalapeno essence. The rye whiskey drink with lemon was one of the best cocktails I've had in a while (can't remember what it's called sorry), but dear god, try it.
