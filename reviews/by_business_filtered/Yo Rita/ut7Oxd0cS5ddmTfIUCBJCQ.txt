4 friends and I had been wanting to try this place for weeks based off rave reviews around the office so we finally did on Friday. Yo Rita blew our expectations away!!! We arrived about 7:30 and the restaurant was maybe 1/4 full, by 8 every table was taken (heads up, they do not take reservations.). They offer unlimited chips and salsa to get your meal started and have a good draft selection (five or six micros) and a really interesting looking drink menu. My only beef is that the drink prices are pretty steep, $9 or $10 for a cocktail. 

I had the chorizo/ dippy egg/ ancho maple sauce taco and the mushroom tostada  while my friends all had the special of the day which was an oyster po' boy taco. After everyone took their first bite silence fell over the table and no one spoke again till they were finished with their taco. A few mmmm's and omg's were heard, but that was it. The food was absolutely fantastic and we all agreed that multiple trips back to try the rest of the menu are in our near future. 

The service was fast, friendly, and attentive. As far as price goes, two tacos, a drink, and tip will run you about $15-$20. That coupled with the unlimited free chips and salsa and you should be out the door fat and happy!
