In a word:  happy hour appetizers = cheap, filling, and tasty dinner.  This is another fantastic safety for an out of town guest who likes their dining "uniquely generic.  I know if I took my grandma here, she would love the corn bread.  I know my mom has a thing for the margueritas as they are novel and not too tequila-y for her (very low) alcoholic tolerance, but alcoholic enough so that if I take even a sip from a second one, I feel it.
