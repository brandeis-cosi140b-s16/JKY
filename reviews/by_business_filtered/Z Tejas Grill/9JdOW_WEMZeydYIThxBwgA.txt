I just can't eat at this one since getting terrible service and then going into the restroom only to find it completely devoid of soap.  Yes, you know what that means boys & girls, none of the female staff had soap to wash their hands either.  GROSS!  This was a year or two ago and fingers crossed they're better now but this Z-Tejas location is ruined for me.
