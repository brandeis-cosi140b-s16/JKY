Been coming here for 15 years, and ZT always delivers. Stopped in last night. Super attentive bartender alerted me to happy hour specials. Pork chile verde with fresh tortillas and black beans, along with homemade cornbread and honey butter in a skillet for $8. The chile verde is real deal, the glob of cheese on top needs to go, however. Good selection of craft brews, rare for a Southwestern eatery.
