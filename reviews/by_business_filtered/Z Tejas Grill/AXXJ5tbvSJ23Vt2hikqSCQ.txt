Really enjoy food here. Severs are courteous and food is just simply awesome. Good for lunch meetings or informal gathering of friends/ family too.

I am a vegetarian. I really like Z'Tejas Trio (chips + cheese +salsa and guacamole) - good for 3-4 people and for main course I like their signature pasta.

If you have never been to this place, it is a must try!

Enjoy \m/
