I don't know if I would come here at any other time besides happy hour, because of the prices and my budget restrictions, but Z'Tejas has very strong margaritas that are definitely worth it and my god, that cornbread. Other than the cornbread, however, it wasn't a particularly memorable dining experience. I wouldn't go out of my way to make a return visit, but if someone suggested it and it was during their happy hour, I may give it another shot.
