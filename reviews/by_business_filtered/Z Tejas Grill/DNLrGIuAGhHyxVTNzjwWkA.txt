The margaritas are good. I enjoyed several "Hard Days" during Happy Hour at $5 a piece. The $8 Street Tacos were very tasty and hit the spot. The service was a little slow and forgetful. I attribute this to the fact that the entire staff is comprised of ASU students. So be patient and you will enjoy the experience.
