4 of us picked this place at the last minute on a Monday night after traveling from Tucson.  We were seated and served immediately.  We started with salsa and chips which we had to pay for but it was well worth it.  For $4.50 we received great chips with 3 different kinds of salsa and some outstanding corn bread.  We all had frosted margaritas which really hit the spot. Our entrees proved to be just as good.  I had Baked Seafood Enchiladas that had a delicious sauce and plenty of seafood--excellent portion as well.  My wife had the Smoked Chicken Chile Relleno which she really enjoyed and our friends had the Achiote chicken salad (said it was a great salad that she couldn't finished and saved for the next day) and one of their classic enchilada dishes with slow roasted beef.  We would definitely go back.
