I went there for a business dinner while on a trip to Phoenix. The interior is nice and some in my party were happy with their meals. Some others including me weren't salivating for a return. I ordered a southwestern salad and a bowl of tortilla soup, Neither was good. Since I don't live there I'm sure I won't be going back. I am giving an overall 3 because some in my party liked their food.
