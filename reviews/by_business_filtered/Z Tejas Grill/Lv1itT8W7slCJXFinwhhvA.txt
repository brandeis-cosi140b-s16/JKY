I'd go back just for the Sunday brunch Mimosa bar! 
You get your glass of champagne & then head to a little area set up by the bar. On one side you have the Mimosa section & on the other the Bloody Mary section. 
I loved selecting the type of juice combinations & the fruit to drop in. I'm easy to please, lol! 

The food was just ok. I got the GREEN CHILE BARBACOA ENCHILADAS . The taste was pretty bland & the beef a bit tough. I was expecting Mexican food taste, but this is definitely more TexMex, which is totally different. Next time I'll try something else. 

This location is right off of Mill. Street parking is hard to snag, but there is a public parking garage less than a block away on 6th.
