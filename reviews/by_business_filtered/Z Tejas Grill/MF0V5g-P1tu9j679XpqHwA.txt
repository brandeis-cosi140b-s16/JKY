Mushroom Enchiladas, YUM!! Might not sound good to some of you, but believe me, these are amazing!! We also got the chips and salsa, which all three versions were a little spicy for me. I like a little spice, but maybe they can tone down the heat drastically on one of the options. Our server was very nice. He was attentive and johnny on the spot with everything. I have been here one other time, also for a business lunch, and I am still a major fan. I need to get back to this place next time I'm in Tempe and try a famous margarita!
