Tried out the Happy Hour here and it was decent. Ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla which was kinda small and in an odd rolled up form, but loaded with carmel;ized onions and a nice smoky white meat shredded chicken for $6. THe guacamole that was alongside was top of line and so was the fresh, homemade salsa. Bud light only $3.50 and i would order that tableside guac straight up next time for $6 at happy hour. Nice staff and they changed the channel promptly on request. Menu looks great, will be back,
