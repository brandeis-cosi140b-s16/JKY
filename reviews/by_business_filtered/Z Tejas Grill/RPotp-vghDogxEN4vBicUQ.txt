Delicious, drinks and dining are always impeccable. Never have had a bad experience. This is a once a month Sunday dinner with the girls event. The margaritas are delicious. The corn bread in the pan adds a little country to the dining experience. The service has always been on point. Drinks refilled before anyone passes by and I have to ask, the cadence of appetizers, entrees and desserts is always great. Never have to rush to finish my salad or finagle plates around on the table.
