Went for Valentines Day and was disappointed. Our food was okay, but service stunk. Our waitress was not very friendly and we witnessed other tables waiting for several minutes to receive their drinks or even be greeted in one case. That table was there for 10 minutes with no greet. Our waitress spilled a water, which I understand was an accident, but the staff left the spill right there on the floor by our table for at least 20 minutes until a manager came up and asked if the roof was leaking. Lucky for them no one slipped and fell. We were not the only table talking about it. Unfortunately our experience will not lead us back there. I had heard good things, but definitely an off night.
