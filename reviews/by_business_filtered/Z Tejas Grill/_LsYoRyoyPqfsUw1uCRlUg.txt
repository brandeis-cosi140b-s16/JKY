I have eaten here numerous times through the years and the food is always really good. This is a solid choice for lunch, dinner and happy hour. But lets be honest people, there is one thing that constantly brings me back to Z tejas, the Chambord Margarita. From the first time that I tried one back in 2001 up to today, this is the best margarita I have ever had. Everytime I come to Mill Ave. this is the first place that I go. I have one Chambord and then hit the town. You gotta get one!
