I came this time to try the happy hour for the first time.  Wasn't as good as I expected and drinks were more than you would normally pay at happy hour but they were premium or top shelf like cabo wabo etc and the two drinks I had were so good that they kind of made up for the high price.   I expected the food to be way better but got the trio and the guac was tasteless had to put lots of salt on it and salsa but the queso that came with it was really good the salsa was just ok.  Steak tacos were pretty good I would get those again.  The shrimp guacamole bites were not that great.  The shrimp on top tasted really good by itself but they put too much of the tasteless guacamole on top of the cracker then top it with the shrimp and that way they are too big to handle in a bite and the boring guac is no fun and seems to take away from the good taste of the shrimp. Total cost for 3 appetizers and 4 drinks $65 without tip.  Next time I would rather go to the Keg House for less and better food too.
