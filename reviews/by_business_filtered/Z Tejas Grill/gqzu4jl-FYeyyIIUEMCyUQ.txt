Chicken tortilla soup is delicious!!! Highly recommended! Everyone that ordered it all agreed that it was perfect. Chambord margarita is delicious as well!! Everyone also agreed that these margaritas were pretty bomb.

I came here previously and just recently for lunch. The whole group I was with enjoyed our lunch especially the margaritas. Two friends had the chicken avocado sandwich with sweet potato fries. I had the soup and a garden salad. Sandwiches are probably the better option but if I didn't say it enough try the tortilla soup! 

I will be back, maybe to try out the happy hour!
