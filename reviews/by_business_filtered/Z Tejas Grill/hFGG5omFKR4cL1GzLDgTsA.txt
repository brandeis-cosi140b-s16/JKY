Z'Tejas was ok...  Went there for some drinks and desert after dinner elsewhere.  Staff was friendly but not that attentive.  Drinks were fine and prices were on point of what I expected.  Did get this brownie pie thing, and it was really good.  However, I would have a hard time recommending this place with my experience.  I am not against going back and would give them another shot for real food, but if that happens I will make sure to update.
