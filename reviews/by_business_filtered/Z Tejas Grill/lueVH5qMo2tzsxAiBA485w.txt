Nothing wrong with this place.
Good food (not great but darn tasty) and service is always good (not great except on occasion.)

My kids and I like to eat here in the afternoons (close to their school) because the appetizers are half-price during happy hour.

We ate for $13.51 before tip yesterday;  an adult and a 12-yr-old girl and a 14-yr-old boy.  And we all got full.

We each had an appetizer and drank water (not paying for the sodas helps keep the tab down.)

One thing I REALLY liked yesterday:  the "Salsa of the Day" was VERY, VERY good.  Had a great spicy kick, a good taste, and I ate three tubs of it myself.  Never before had they given me one this good, and I'd say we've eaten there somewhere between 8-12 times.
