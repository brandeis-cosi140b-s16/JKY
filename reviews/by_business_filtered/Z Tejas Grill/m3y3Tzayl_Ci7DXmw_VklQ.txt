5 star margaritas (even for a house recipe) and selection of homemade salsas! I might even give the ambience 5 stars but the locals probably wouldn't be as generous... being from Michigan, I was just so happy to sit outside, on a patio, in the sunshine, in the middle of January.

In total, we ordered a 2 frozen & 2 on rocks margaritas, chips & salsa and split the mushroom spinach quesadilla as our main dish. 

You get a free corn bread skillet at this location.  It's a very generous portion and tasted pretty good but we took most of it as leftover. I would've preferred the chips & salsas to be complimentary regardless of how clich√© that'd be.  

Overall, the food was all better than I expected it to be. The ingredients seemed fresh with good color and texture at each bite. This isn't your commercial chain tex mex; it's good food and drinks full of care and hospitality from kitchen to table service.

I heard they had wicked happy hour deals starting at 3 but we missed the window of time by a couple hours.
