I went here for the first time recently. I asked the waitress what to order because I am pretty picky and don't like a lot of the main ingredients in tex-mex (peppers, tomatoes, onions, etc). She said the mac and cheese with blackened chicken was amazing so I went for it. Honestly, it is the best mac and cheese I have ever had. You need to go and try it. I had everyone at our table try it and they all loved it. Also, their margaritas are delicious and they put a lot of alcohol in them which is always a plus. I plan on going there soon as now I am craving their mac and cheese.
