Overall I had a great experience here. The food was delicious and the prices are very reasonable. We had a mix up with one of the appetizers but the waitress was very nice and accommodating.

The service: I am a little upset I forgot our waitresses name ( I lost the receipt with her name on it). She was very nice and helpful. Super friendly. You could tell that they were under staffed and not expecting the crowd that they had. We ordered some appetizers and myself and one other lady in my party got the same thing. When the food came out she only put in one of the orders. She thought we were sharing not that we ordered 2 of the same thing. The lady who's order did not come out was a little rude to her but the waitress handled it in stride and was very accommodating and offered multiple solutions to help rectify the problem.

The food: I ordered the crab cakes as an appetizer, and the peppered rib eye dinner special. The special came with a 10oz steak, mashed potatoes, and seasonal veggies (I asked for all broccoli). Th steak was cooked exactly how i ordered it (medium) and very tasty. They serve a hot cornbread as your "bread". It was DEVINE. I wanted some to go but didn't want to be obese.

If I was ever in an area that had this restaurant, I would absolutely go again. I only gave the 4 stars because of the mixup with the appetizers but other than that this is a solid place to go eat.
