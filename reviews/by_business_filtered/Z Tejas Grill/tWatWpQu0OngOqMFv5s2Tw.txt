The margaritas and the shrimp tostada bites are amazing!!! This is a great place for happy hour, especially with a big crowd since they take reservations and let you order off the happy hour menu from anywhere in the restaurant. I like the appetizers much better than the rest of the menu which is a little bit pricey and I think less tasty. But I do love Z'Tejas happy hour! I also LOVE that they have free valet which is super-convenient for Mill Ave.!
