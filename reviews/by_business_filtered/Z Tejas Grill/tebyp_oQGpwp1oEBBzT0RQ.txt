It was alright. Nothing to write home about. Hence the lack of review.
The Grilled Shrimp thing was pretty good.
The service was good, our waiter was very attentive.

My only mistake is that I mistook the green sliced vegetable on top of the pasta as green bell peppers (which I love)..turns out after a few bite in my mouth I realized it was jalapenos! (which I hate) You can image my shock.
