We were enjoying a wonderful margarita when we saw a flight of margaritas go past.  So...we ordered 2 flights (6 total little glasses) labeled them and started a serious taste test.  Our wonderful bartender, Daniel, assisted us.  The winner in the taste test was the Patron margarita.  We enjoyed those little shrimp tostada as we tasted.  Soooo good.
