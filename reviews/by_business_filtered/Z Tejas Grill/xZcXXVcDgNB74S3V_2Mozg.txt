I've been here a couple times now and I do enjoy coming to eat here every now and again. Good-sized portions, and their cornbread is just amazing. Favorite thing to get here is the street tacos (I'm a bit of a taco addict), but I want to try their veggie tacos as well. Good queso/nachos. Customer service is very good - the servers are friendly and accommodating. I love their teas; all unsweetened, but they've got great flavors. My favorite so far is the mango one, though the passion fruit is also good. Oh, and their tortilla soup is GREAT. That + cornbread + tea = the perfect comfort, recovery meal after a hangover.
