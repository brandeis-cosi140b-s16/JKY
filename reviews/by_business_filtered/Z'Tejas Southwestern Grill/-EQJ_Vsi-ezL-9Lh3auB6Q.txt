Having been to several locations in TX, I was familiar with the menu...this was a very busy location.  We got seated quickly and had a very personable waitperson.  She was busy so service was a bit slow but her personality made up for it.  The food came in a reasonable time, we did start with a trio...guac, queso and a salsa- all very good.  The mains came and I ordered the diablo pasta, it was really good but even better when she brought chipotle sauce to spice it up a bit more.  We were too full for dessert.  Good food and fun atmosphere...   
I would not recommend if you are a stickler for prompt service but good service you will get.
