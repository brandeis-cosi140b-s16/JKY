I can't say nothing but great things about Z'Tejas. My husband and I eat here at least once-twice a week. I usually get the avocado chicken sandwich with sweet potato fries (YUM!!!!) and my husband gets the chopped chicken salad or the steak burrito. The restaurant is always packed, but the servers do a great job and are always attentive. 

If you're looking for a great happy hour, they have the best around, hands down. Nothing beats their chambord margarita and tejas trio. The best part is that they have happy hour on the weekends all afternoon!

If you've never been, you have to try it!
