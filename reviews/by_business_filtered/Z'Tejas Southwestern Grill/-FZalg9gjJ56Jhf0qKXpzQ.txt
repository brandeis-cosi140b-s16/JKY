I recently went to the new Z'tejas location on 16th and Bethany for my one year anniversary and we were sat near the windows and our server recommended some margaritas. The fruzion was delicious. And so were both of our meals also recommended by our server. We both had the diablo chicken pasta. Our server was a short blonde, her name escapes me but I thoroughly enjoyed my time at this restaurant.
