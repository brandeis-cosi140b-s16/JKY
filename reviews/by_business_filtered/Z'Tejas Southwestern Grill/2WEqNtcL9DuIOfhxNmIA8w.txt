Brunch was very disappointing--like a bad expensive Denny's. Bloody Mary bar is outstanding and the building is nice, but the food was expensive and failed miserably to live up to the menu descriptions. It's surrounded by great brunch restaurants that don't disappoint--I won't return for weekend brunch.
