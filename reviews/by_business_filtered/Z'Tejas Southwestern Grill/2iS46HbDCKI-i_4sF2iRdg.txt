Husband and I went for reverse happy hour on a Friday at 9. We got their nachos and quesadilla which were both pretty good. They were each $5. The bartender was nice and the food came out fast. My only complaint is that they charged $2 for seltzer water/club soda. Really?!? Unless that's a norm for Arizona?
