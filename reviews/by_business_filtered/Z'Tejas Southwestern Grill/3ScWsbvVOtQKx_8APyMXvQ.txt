I was very impressed by this location. I came here afterwork for dinner and was allowed to choose my seat as the location was not very busy. My waitress was very friendly and answered my questions about different dishes. I ended up getting the fish tacos with a side of veggies. The fish tacos were extremely good and I lovded the mango sauce that came with them.
