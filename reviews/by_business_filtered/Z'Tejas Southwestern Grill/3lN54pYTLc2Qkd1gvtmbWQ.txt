I don't get the love for Z'Tejas.Yes, its better than chains like On the Border, Chevy's, or Olive Garden but its still a chain and really nothing special. The appetizers aren't bad, but nothing on the menu blows my socks off. 

The atmosphere is, well what atmosphere? It's just kind of a generic restaurant. Plus the servers seem so artificially peppy that I'm tempted to ask if they are wearing the requisite amount of flair... I know, I know, they don't actually wear flair, but it has that feel.

Plus, I hate it when the manager is clearly tasked with going around to every table and checking on your meal. Do it because you care, not just because its a required part of the job.

Both the waiter and the manager came around numerous times during our meal and the question was always "Is everything great!" I wanted to respond that you both keep walking up at inopportune times and interrupting our conversation, so no its not great now, but I was with coworkers and decided to be his nice.

That being said, with so many other good restaurants nearby, I see no reason to go back to Z'Tejas anytime soon.
