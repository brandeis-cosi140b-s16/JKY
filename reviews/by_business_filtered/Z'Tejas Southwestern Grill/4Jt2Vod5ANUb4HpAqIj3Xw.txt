We haven't been here for awhile but were SO happy to revisit. Our meal from start to finish was top-notch and our server couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. Darn, I wish I could remember his name - a clever nickname that I swore I'd remember. Oh, well - he was amazing. Our fresh guacamole was terrific and that cornbread is always cooked to perfection. Can't get enough! Our margaritas were dynamite too. I ordered the ruby trout and it was spectacular. Loved the sides as well. My friend ordered the stacked enchilada and that was flavorful too. I don't think you could go wrong with just about anything on this menu. Oh, and Happy Hour prices are very affordable. Thanks!!
