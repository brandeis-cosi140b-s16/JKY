On 3/11 we had a perfect brunch at Z'Tejas.  Is this 5-star dining?  Technically no, but everything from drinks to food to service was perfect that Sunday.  I ordered the Eggs Bene Z' Style which has the poached eggs on top of their delicious cornbread with chipotle hollandaise and jalapeno bacon, and a side of breakfast potatoes.  I've got to get over being bashful with my camera because this was a good-looking dish, and tasted even better.  If you're feeling a little adventurous give it a try, you won't be disappointed.  Every aspect of that dish was perfect and I'm still thinking about it.

Mr. M ordered the Hickory Burger and that was another item worthy of a picture.  Cooked medium rare as he ordered it, the smoky flavors were delicious and the sweet potato fries were very good as well.

I can't rave enough about the service.  We had a couple of the $4 mimosas and then for dessert shared a ginger something something martini.    We sat in the bar area and were greeted immediately with an explanation of the bloody mary/mimosa bar options.  The bartender brought us the champagne, and then we added our choice of juice.  The mango juice is a phenomenal choice.

When it came time for the ginger something something martini, we said we were going to share it.  The bartender was so funny and said he didn't want any fighting over the drink, so he made it with 2 glasses and we each got a healthy pour of about 2/3rds the glass.  That drink was one to savor, with I think crystallized ginger on the rim.  Delicious!  Two bartenders took care of us and I wish I would have caught their names because they were prompt, friendly, and funny.  5-stars all the way.  Can't wait to go back!
