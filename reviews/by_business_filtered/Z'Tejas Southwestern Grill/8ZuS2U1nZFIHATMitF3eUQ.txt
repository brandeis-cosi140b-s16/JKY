I love going to z'Tejas. The place is always nice and friendly. The margaritas are great and I love the cornbread! My favorite dish is the gorganzola New York strip. Nothing like a sprinkle of cheese on your steak! I also enjoy the tomato basil dressing but will pass on those weird things they call croutons...
