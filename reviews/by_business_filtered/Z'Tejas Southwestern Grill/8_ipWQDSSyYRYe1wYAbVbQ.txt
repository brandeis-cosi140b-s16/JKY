Went here for a business lunch today.  Can't give this place much more credence than I would an Applebee's, though.  Ordered the avacado turkyburger and requested well done steak fries.  Burger was dry and overly herby, fries were NOT well done and not even done-done in my opinion - sorta stale even.  Free corn bread is a nice perk cuz it's quite good and served very hot in a little fancy cast-iron pan with a big 'ol steak knife for servin' & a side a' butter.  Everyone you talk to who has been to Z'Tejas will mention the corn bread, the corn bread, the corn bread.  Yippie yay.   It managed to upstage my $11 turkey-blah-ger.  So, congrats, overachieving cornbread, to a job well done!

Service:  Our server was friendly and attentive and she let us talk prior to ordering without interrupting us.  Generally a good vibe here.

Food overall is just...meh, in my opinion.  I didn't try my companions entrees at all, though they had no complaints.   The food here reminded me of Rainforest Cafe - the smells, the portions, the prices. Just not my thing.
