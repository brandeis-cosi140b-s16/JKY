Came to Z'Tejas around 3pm for some light bites and really enjoyed it. The staff was super friendly, we happened to be there for happy hour and ordered the Tejas trio and street tacos. Both were delicious. I ordered the skinny cucumber mule and was super impressed, this drink was very unique and extremely refreshing! Really awesome happy hour selection and great prices! Would definitely come here again.
