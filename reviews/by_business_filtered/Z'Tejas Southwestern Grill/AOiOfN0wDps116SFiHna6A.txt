A friend of mine dragged me here saying it was one of her favorite restaurants. Obviously I had high expectations, but they were not completely met.

One big problem which is not necessarily the restaurants fault is cornbread. Z Tejas is a southwestern restaurant and they serve cornbread before your meal. BLEH. I hate cornbread! I don't know why I just think it's nasty! 

The Chicken pasta I had was very good, but this restaurant is just not my style. Small menu with nothing that really appealed to me. Good service and nice atmosphere. If you like cornbread ...SIGH..you will probably love this place.
