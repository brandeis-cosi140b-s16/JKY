Nothing superb, but certainly nothing bland.  Z'Tejas is a quality Tex-Mex chain that rarely disappoints.  It has that bar vibe, but certainly not the Scottsdale vibe that most of the restaurants in Fashion Square seem to be going for.

My girlfriend and I were in the mall late on Saturday when we realized we hadn't eaten, yet.  We decided on Z'Tejas  because the menu is filled with foods that we both like.  Then again, I don't know how anyone lives in the southwest if they don't like Tex-Mex.  She had the turkey burger, which she enjoyed.  I had the smoked chicken chile relleno.  It was just okay, certainly not close to the best I've ever had.  We also had the table side guacamole and chips.  Awesome!  I highly recommend it to anyone.  Also awesome; the corn bread Z'Tejas serves with every meal.  I could eat that all day!

Z'Tejas is another spot inside Fashion Square Mall that I don't think I would ever go out of my way to eat at.  But it certainly is a place you won't go wrong with if you happen to be in the mall and looking for a good bite to eat.
