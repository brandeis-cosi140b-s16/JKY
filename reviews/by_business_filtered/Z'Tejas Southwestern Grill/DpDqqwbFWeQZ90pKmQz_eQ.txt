One of my best friends, Renee, has been in town for a few days & I still hadn't seen her so I knew I had to meet up w/her for dinner last night, or else I'd be the world's shittiest friend. Any way, I hate Scottsdale (no offense) so I had a lil trouble getting there & parked kinda far from the restaurant. Fashion Square is such a nice mall though, I don't think I've been there for at least 2 years!

Renee & a couple of her friends were sitting on the patio outside. Since I live 25 minutes away I was way late & they were already done eating. Thankfully, they were in no hurry & sat w/me while I ordered some grub & they ordered more drinks. I decided to order 2 apps instead of an entree, I got the catfish beignets & leo's street tacos, both signature dishes. They were both so yummy, I really can't decide which one I liked better! I really wanted a marg but since I had such a long drive decided not to. I did try Amy's chambord marg though & it was delish! I hear there's a 3 drink limit w/them & I can see why-super strong!

I would love to go to the Tatum & Shea location (much closer to home) & have an actual entree & a DD so I can have a tasty marg (or 3)!
