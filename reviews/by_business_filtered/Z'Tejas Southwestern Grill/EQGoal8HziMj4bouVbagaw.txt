10 year vet here, and, this is not even close to what I remember.  Like the one in Bellevue, food, service and consistency have all hit the sewer.  Used to be a big Samoan dude there that knew exactly what we wanted from cocktail to apps even only seeing us 3-4x/yr... now it is as if we, no not loud mouthed college kids, have to pull teeth, to get simple, basic, kindness.   Prices up service and food quality down and more and more fake rolexes.... becoming p.f. chunks.
