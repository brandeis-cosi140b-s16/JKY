Would definitely come back for Happy Hour.  Cute/bistro place.  The restaurant layout is pretty cool.  Tri level restaurant with two bars.  The entrance level has a bar that is seated outside with the water mist to keep you cool.  A group of us went there for dinner.  It was 6pm and we had been seated in their regular dining area of the restaurant.  We were about to order an appetizer when the waiter told us we can order off the Happy Hour menu before 630pm!  So excited we all ordered our dinners off the Happy hour menu. 

We ordered the trio dip chips thing (chili con queso, salsa, and guacamole).  Perfect to share with 5 people and SO DELISH!.  The Ahi seared tuna was okay.  The fish wasn't too fresh.  And the seasoning was like a sweet soy sauce.  It was weird.  
I also had the blacken catfish tacos.  It reminded me of a tortilla sandwich wrap.  It came with this dip that must have been  inspired by  Asian/Southwestern infused flavor with a hint of heat/spice to it.  For $5 bucks and 4 of these mini sandwiches, I could have been full off of this.  I would order this again.   And could come back.
