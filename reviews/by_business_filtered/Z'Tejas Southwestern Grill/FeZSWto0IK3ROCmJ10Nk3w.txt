Went here a few weeks ago for brunch. I will say that I am still a fan of Z Tejas but I think I just ordered the wrong thing. I had the potato hash and eggs which was ok but it seemed like it needed something more flavor wise. Maybe a little more sauce on top would have made it better. Also, since I was sick, I ordered the tortilla soup. It was a thick soup and I actually prefer brothier tortilla soups. Wasn't bad though. As always, the cornbread was phenomenal. I also had a red sangria and it was delicious and refreshing. My companion said that she loved her burger and fries. I still love Z Tejas but I will probably just go for dinner there from here on out since that is where they really shine.
