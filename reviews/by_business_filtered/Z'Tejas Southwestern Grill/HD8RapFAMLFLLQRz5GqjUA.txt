I was a little bummed to see a chain restaurant open in the neighborhood, but figured I'd give it a chance. That was a mistake. Went with a large party. Everyone's food, and I mean everyone's was over sauced. Not one person finished their meal. Most barely made a dent. We ALL agreed is was just not good.  So sad. Something locally owned would have been a much better addition to the neighborhood.
