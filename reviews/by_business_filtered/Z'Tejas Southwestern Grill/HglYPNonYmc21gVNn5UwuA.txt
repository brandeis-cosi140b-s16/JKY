Very good atmosphere. 
Tried couple of appetizers: shrimp-avocado tostado bites and the triple option (queso, ): both pretty good
The warm corn bread they served before our order was just awesome. 
However I was disappointed with their chicken fajitas: not sizzling and the chicken wasn't succulent. 
My colleagues liked their shrimp pasta.
