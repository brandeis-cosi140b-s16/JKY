My favorite chicken tortilla soup and corn bread. 
Great indoor or outdoor seating. 
Many times I have called in for take out food there for dinner parties and have never been disappointed. The food holds great in chaffing dishes and the corn bread is terrific for dinner parties. Cut it into four pieces and place in a linen covered bowl to keep warm and moist. Reheats fabulously.
