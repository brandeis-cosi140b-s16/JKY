Friend and myself had lunch today at Z Tejas.  It was a very nice lunch, nice d√©cor, very good service, endless refills on our ice teas.  I had the Z Chicken Salad (cilantro pesto chicken, mixed greens, bell peppers, Roma tomatoes, Jack & Cheddar cheese with a sundried tomato basil vinaigrette)  at $12.75 and my friend had the Achiote Chicken chopped salad (iceberg lettuce, avocado, bacon, black beans, Cotija cheese, roasted corn, pepitas, Roma Tomatoes,
red cabbage and Ranch vinaigrette at $13.00.  It came with a hot cornbread served in a hot skillet with honey butter on the side.  The portions were very generous and I would definitely return again.
