My family and I frequent here. Went to happy hour, 8 tables toward the back were open but no one would be sat until happy hour was over with. Looked like they were short staffed maybe? Open tables but no one to take them? I waited tables for 10 years and that's what it looked like to me :/
Just frustrating to make the trip and be turned away. We come here so often we could've even went to get our own corn bread lol. 
Convenient that a table would be ready RIGHT after happy hour stopped though......hmmmmm
