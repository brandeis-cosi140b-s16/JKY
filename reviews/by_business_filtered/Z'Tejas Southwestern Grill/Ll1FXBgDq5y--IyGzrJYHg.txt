Ok, here's the thing. This place is the favorite of one of my co-workers, so she always wants to head here after work (for the famously strong margaritas everyone else raves about.)  However, I'm a beer man, and there are only about 5 choices here, which are a whopping 50 cents off during happy hour. When my waitress first told me that, I just stood there and looked at her, waiting for her to tell me that she was just kidding. She didn't. 

Of all the things I have eaten here, probably the most memorable was the pulled pork nachos which I just had yesterday. I was expecting a plate piled high, but to my surprise they brought out the plate and there were.... 6.  Six nacho chips, arranged in a circle on my plate.  I felt pretty cheated at first.

However, they were pretty big chips... and they were loaded with heaping helpings of pulled pork which was really pretty good.  Often I think this place tries to be too fancy with their food, but these were just mounds of bbq goodness. Throw a little guac on top (a combo I never thought of trying) and I was extremely satisfied. Of course the 3 beers (which I saved 50 cents on - each) helped out with that.

So minus one star for the happy hour specials, lack of beer choices,  and the pretentiousness, and the rest is all good.
