I liked this place.  GOOD drinks.  Yeah, I had a lot of margarita's that night.  The food was good too.  I had this scallop appetizer which was incredible.  I guess it better be since it was like an $18 appetizer!!  LMAO  Hey, it was someone else's dime so I don't give a crap.  I don't like that vendor too much anyway.
