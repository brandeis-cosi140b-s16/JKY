Amazing service! Whenever I go I always get waiters who are friendly and nice, and the food is excellent as well. No matter what you order you won't be disappointed. The only thing that's bad is the price but there's nothing wrong with spending the right amount for good food, and not to mention that they give you free cornbread as well, which is also excellent by the way
