Z'Tejas has great margaritas (DUH), a great wine list and great food.  The atmosphere is awesome and I have never had an issue with service whether dining in the bar or in the dining room.  They are even nice enough to customize my margarita with jalapenos when I go there.  You'd think it wouldn't be that hard for a Mexican/Margarita joint but I have a hard time getting that request fulfilled at several places around PHX.

Bottom line, this is a great place for a date, a friendly get together or even lunch!!  The food will get you in the door and the cocktails and ambiance will get you coming back.
