Came here for dinner with a party of 9 or 10 last week will attending a nearby conference. A few of our diners have been coming to this place for many years due to its location near the conference, and they raved about the crispy salmon.

When we arrived, the restaurant wasn't too busy, and they seated us at a large table after we grabbed our drinks from the bar.

We quickly found out that the crispy salmon was no longer part of the menu; a big disappointment for the regulars in our group. It's funny, because even as I write this review, their online menu shows the dish.

Our waitress was very nice, and apologetic. Without our knowing, she mentioned our disappointment to the manager, who made it a point to come by the table and explain that they had recently (within the last few weeks) we under new management, and the menu changed as a result. He was nice & polite and asked if there was anything he could do. A few minutes later, the waitress brought out two complementary Chili con Queso appetizers for the table to share. A nice touch, which we all appreciated.

Anyway, the meal was OK. I don't even recall what I had; fish of some sort but nothing overly memorable. Don't know if I would come back on my own.

I will say that our waitress was great! Patient and well tempered and even was kind enough to write up separate checks for everyone at the end of the meal; something many restaurants frown on with large parties, especially if not requested at time of ordering.
