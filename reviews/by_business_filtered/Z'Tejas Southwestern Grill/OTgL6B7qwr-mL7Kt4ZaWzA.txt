So happy they opened a  Central Phoenix location. We visit 2-3 times a month. We make it a point to go for Lunch when Josh is working the bar. He is amazing!!!! He always remembers us, and makes sure that we are well taken care of.   It does not matter how slow or busy the bar is, he is always right on point.  If you have never been, the dumpling are a must have.
