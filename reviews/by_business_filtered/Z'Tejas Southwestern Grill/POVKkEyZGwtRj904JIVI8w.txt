The Z chicken salad was really good! We had the appetizer that came with chips and three different salsas. That was really good too! Everyone I was with said they enjoyed their food; the only complaint was that it was a little on the spicy side. The reason Z Tejas loses a star from me is the service. It was super slow! I was surprised because it looks like a place that would have very attentive servers. Overall it was an average experience that probably only deserves 3 stars but I'm feeling generous today so I'll give it 4.
