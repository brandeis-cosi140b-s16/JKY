I have been here many times and enjoy the menu because of its' diverse options. What is lacking is the service. Tonight I went with 3 friends and our server was less than attentive-in fact we had to hunt her down. We got good service from the busses and expediter but would have ordered more drinks if she just swung by now and then. If the service were good, the food would be a  5 but the prices are a bit high to beg for a refill from a random server.  Diablo pasta is spicy and has interesting flavor. Others had a steak, fish tacos, and quesadilla.  Everyone finished their food And enjoyed it but commented on the lack of service. It will be a while before I try again.
