I stop in this location frequently. I have been going to Z'Tejas since the 90's in Las Vegas and happy I can still go to this restaurant. Their Jerk Chicken salad always hits the spot. 
What really keeps me coming back to this location is the service. The general manager Mike is amazing! He comes out to your table to make sure everything is as you'd expect. It seems no matter when I go there, Mike is working and looking over the place like he owns it.
Ask for him when you dine in.
