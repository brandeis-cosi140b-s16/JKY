I'd like to preface this by saying I really do like Z'Tejas.  The food is always good, and the service is usually spot on.  The problem I have with this particular location is the hostess(es), and their amazing ability to lose reservations.  On more than one ocassion, I've showed up only to find they have no record of my reservation.  They always look confused and ask me if I was sure I called the right location.  My favorite was when they wanted to know if I put it under the wrong name.  I'm sure I forget my own name all the time.  Awww.....it's ok, hostess(es), at least you're pretty.
