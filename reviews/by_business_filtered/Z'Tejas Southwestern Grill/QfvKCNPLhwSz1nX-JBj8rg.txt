Not saying this is an elegant Latin Fusion Restaurant with a high end atmosphere and ambiance.  But for the price, amazing waiter service, quality food and cleanliness, this place is a legit Tex-Mex Restaurant.

Great Strawberry Mojito, Green Chile Chicken Barboa Enchiladas, Chips and Salsa...

Ask for Bradley...  Great waiter!
