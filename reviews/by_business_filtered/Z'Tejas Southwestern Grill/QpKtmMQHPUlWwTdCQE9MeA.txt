Me: What's your San Tan Brewing rotational?
Server: Oh we don't have that anymore. We replaced it with Blue Moon and Bud Light.
Me: ...............

This was how my brunch started at Z'Tejas SW Grill. #FirstWorldProblems... I know. But this is the reason I tend to Not dine at large corporate chain restaurants. 

I ended up getting a Four Peaks Hop Knot. The only local on tap and a good one, but would have liked more local options. 

Other than that and the subpar service we received on this day, I do like Z'Tejas. I've been to this location once and the Tatum location another time. If you've never been here, the corn bread is delicious. It comes complimentary with the meal to boot.

Since we were here for brunch, most of our party enjoyed their build your own Bloody Mary and Mimosa bar as well. Another hit. 

For my main foods, I got the Pork Verde & Eggs. It was pretty good. I'm not a big breakfast person in general, but this was enjoyable. 

Overall, this is a decent place if you must go to a corporate franchisey type restaurant. For me.... they lost a couple stars for the wobley service and also for whoever's bright idea it was to replace San Tan with Bud Light and/or Blue Moon..... Other than that... I'd generally be a fan.
