Probably one of the better places to take a date, not to secluded, a busy restaurant yet you can carry on a conversation.  My pork arrived a bit raw so I did send it back, and I was hoping to get some kind of discount for it, but I've had way to many meals at this place so I can overlook it.  A bit pricey, but you can't find the type of food they make any where else.  I wish they had the Chilean Sea Bass all the time but it's seasonal, the most unbelievable piece of fish I've had.
