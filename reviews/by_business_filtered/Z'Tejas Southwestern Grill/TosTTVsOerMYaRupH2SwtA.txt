After a long day/night of work my group of 4 found ourselves here for dinner. Although Phoenix may be busy with snowbirds this time of year, there was no wait for a table on a Monday night. Or perhaps we just missed the early bird special!

We began our meal with some of their ridiculously tasty cornbread and a chip plate. Guac, salsa and queso (my fave when visiting the Southwest). I'm a bit of a chip-o-holic and even more so when queso is involved.

 For my entr√©e I went with the crab cake salad. Good, although I admit to being a bit envious of my colleague's miso salmon. On my list for next time! After eating a bit of the salad I was very full...likely from all the chips.

The service was good. We were seated, fed and paid within record time. There are so many good restaurants in Phoenix to choose from, but I"d go back to this one if looking for a spot in the mall.
