I participate in a group that meets here weekly and the service and food have been outstanding EVERY TIME. The staff are always friendly and greet everyone with a smile, and they seem to go out of their way to make the experience of dining there special.  The food is always great!  My personal favorites are the Green Chile Pork Stew and the Mango Chile Steak Salad. The margaritas are great (even the Skinny). I highly recommend their happy hour - margs are $5 and the Green Chile Stew is $6, and of course there's always plenty of fresh, hot cornbread and butter!
