Every restaurant in this part of Arizona should expect to be busy during super bowl weekend right? Well apparently our waitress didn't appreciate the extra customers that helped pay her wages and tips. In fact, after waiting at our table for a menu and politely asking her for one she tells us "just a minute, I have 20 things in my brain."

Food was actually REALLY good.  The waiter, not so much.  Eventually, we asked her why she was being rude or whether we had offended her because of her attitude.  She says she felt we were having an attitude with her...BLANK STARE!!!

We eventually talked to manager who was very nice/apologetic and even comp'd some of our appetizers.  When we were leaving we overheard another table complaining about same person.

I think her name was Molly...if she happens to be your server, I won't say leave the restaurant but I'd definitely either move to bar or a different section because she certainly puts a damper on what could be really great food/drink experience.

We were party of 4 and thought that happy hour appetizers were small plates, so we each ordered one (some of us ordered two).  Portions are LARGE and probably enough to share with 2-4 people, so I would not recommend each ordering one appetizer.  

I'd also avoid the potstickers but EVERYTHING else (and yes I think I tasted everything else) was great.
