Went there today for the Sunday Brunch. So good!!!! I have food allergies and the manager, Jennifer was so helpful in making sure that I received the correct plate. I am in the restaurant industry and it was wonderful to see how much she cares about her guests!!! We will definitely be back again, and again!!! Great food, drinks, atmosphere and service!!!
