I'm impressed with the service here. If there is an issue with your order or if it's taking so long, the managers  walk  around to see if everything is okay. I don't normally eat a lot of carbs, but their corn bread is the bomb! Big portions, reasonable price and the food is good too! Check out their happy hour menu!
