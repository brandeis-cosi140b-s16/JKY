A chain of Tex-Mex restaurants in the Phoenix area. Nothing special, but not bad. Hard to rave about this place. It feels corporate like so many other chain restaurants around the country. The upsides are the cold beer (Dos Equis & Negro Modelo on draft - can't argue with that) and the extensive menu that includes a pretty delicious salsa trio and some tasty fish tacos (as an appetizer). Like almost everything we experienced out west, the portion sizes were enormous. Maybe that's just a U.S. thing these days. You could certainly do worse than Z'Tejas, though next time I'm in Phoenix I hope to seek out some authentic Mexican food rather than relying on an Inc's interpretation of it.
