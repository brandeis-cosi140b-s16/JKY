I got the mushroom enchilada and it was so good. It had black beans, corn, cheese, a mango salsa that was super tasty. The creamy sauce was super savory and more on the sweet side. It was a good sweet though. I definitely recommend it. The service was phenomenal. We always had our drinks refilled and were always helped out when needed.
