Great staff.  The first time I visited a Z'Tejas, it was at the location in Phoenix for brunch.  I didn't even know there was a location in Chandler.  At night this location has a "grown and sexy" like vibe with the dim lighting.  We went to celebrate a friend's birthday.  Love that they have a whole veggie section on the menu, it made choosing my meal so simple.  I had the wild mushroom enchiladas, my friends had the salmon.  The Food was good but the portions are a bit small.  My friends enjoyed their cocktails and the Ancho Fudge Pie was Yum!  Staff is really kind and accommodating.  Love the cornbread!
