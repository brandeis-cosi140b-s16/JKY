I really enjoy the atmosphere here.  Its calm,  relaxing after. Long day at the office. Make sure you try the street tacos or the blackened catfish tacos. The only grioe i have is today the bartender was not as personable as the last time i will blame that on the amount of patrons the restaurant has.  No one wants to be seated elsewhere other then the bar area.
