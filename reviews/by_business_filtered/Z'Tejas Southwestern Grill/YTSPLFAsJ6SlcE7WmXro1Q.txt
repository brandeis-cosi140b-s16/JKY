I've been eating at Z Tejas since '96 at Fashion Square (Tatum is closer to us now.).  Normally always good.  Awesome table side quac!!  Wish they would bring back the original orange peel, spicy fajitas!  

****Don't try to run in 15 minutes before they close and order food -- They tell you on the phone they are still serving, but at least 3 times we've gotten there and they say it's too late to order:-(.   Very annoying, especially as a long time customer.
