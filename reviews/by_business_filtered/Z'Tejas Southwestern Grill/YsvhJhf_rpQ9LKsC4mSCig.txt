Get the Chicken Chop Salad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Phew, now that I got that important information out there... I can tell you that it was a delightful lunch.  Our waitress was spot on and really fun.  We also ordered the Nacho Trio app and the cheese was sooo gooey, spicy and delicious!  And then there is the cornbread... that was too good to pass up too! And since we were having mexican, we had their $6 margaritas and well, it was a great girl's lunch!
