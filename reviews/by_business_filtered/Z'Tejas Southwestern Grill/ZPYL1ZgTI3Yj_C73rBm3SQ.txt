12/17/15 food was fine - today the service not so good! Will I be back yes so far food has been okay. Seems here the service has been a hit or miss. Was some busy but not slammed. Well maybe it was my fault the on tap beer selection is boring. Manager walked by and says hi, not how was everything and would have shared with her, my lunch order had been delivered before I got chips and salsa which I had to ask for. Oh well! Oh she was at the hostess stand when I entered - wasn't the friendliest greet, matter fact I was an interruption, she glanced around to find her hostesses, she didn't even stop what she was doing to help a newly arrived guest.
