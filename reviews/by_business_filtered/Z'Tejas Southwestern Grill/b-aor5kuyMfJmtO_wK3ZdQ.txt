Z'Tejas is awesome! They had me at the free cornbread, which is delicious and moist...and free. There are many vegetarian options, most of which are a lot more interesting than the standard veg tex mex fare, which is a large part of why I think this chain is great. The veggie chopped salad is chock full of yummy and fresh toppings, and there is well enough protein (cheese, nuts) to be quite filling, especially with the cornbread starter. The guacamole is fresh and spot on delicious. The interior of the restaurant is really nice, especially around the holidays where they deck it out in string lights (very festive). Service is quick and friendly, parking is (as expected at this mall) a giant pain.
