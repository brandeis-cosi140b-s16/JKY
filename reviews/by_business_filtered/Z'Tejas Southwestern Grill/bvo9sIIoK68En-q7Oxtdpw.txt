Went to dinner about 7:00 on a Friday night to relax, share dinner and a margarita.  We were seated in the raised up area to find incredible noise, lots of  kids and loud laughing tables of people.  it is good to enjoy your dinner but it was chaotic, so loud we had to shout to hear each other, not relaxing in the least!  My bread plate was wet and had food on it, and the table next to us was cleared so haphazardly  that a tray of food was left on the chair and the next guest almost sat on it but we warned her.  it will be awhile before I would choose to eat there again!
