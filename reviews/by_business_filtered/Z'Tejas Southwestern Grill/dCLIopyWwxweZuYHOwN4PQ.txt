Z'Tejas = num yummy!! I mean the margaritas and cornbread alone are worth coming to visit. I had some pulled pork quesadilla's that were packed with yummy goodness. Lots of pulled pork with the coleslaw. OMG. I could only eat two of the four pieces as I had already filled up on cornbread and chips and salsa. The only thing I was bummed about was that the cornbread can out a little cold for my liking. If could have even been warm I would have been happy, but it did not stop me from eating it. Definitely a great place to come, especially for happy hour!
