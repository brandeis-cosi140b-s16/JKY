Food was great servers were good but the manager was unacceptably rude. I figured after ordering 120$ worth of food in this restaurant. And being the one who payed for it I would have been treated better. Not sure what his name was but he was taller with glasses and a receding hair line. I won't be going back to this place any more. At least not this location.
