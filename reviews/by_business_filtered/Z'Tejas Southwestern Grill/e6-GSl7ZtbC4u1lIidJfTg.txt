No more cornbread - raised happy hour prices and didn't raise quality or change menu. Server have a bs answer that they are trying to "class it up" and be "more of a fine dining restaurant". 
I had to have our server take 3 kids drinks for $2.95 a piece off of our check that should've come with the meal.We were also charged for our brothers birthday dessert which we just paid for, not knowing if a birthday dessert is usually comped or not. 
 We ordered an additional dessert too. Promise we aren't cheap....just disappointed.
