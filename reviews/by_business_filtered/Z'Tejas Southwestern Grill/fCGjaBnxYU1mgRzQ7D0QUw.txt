Ok, I actually really like Z Tejas, but last time we visited, the tap water was so disgusting that I have to say something.  To the management team: do whatever you have to do to fix the water situation.  You'll make the cost back on just my visits alone and I am sure others have the same problem.  Lastly, do you really clean the lettuce with that stuff?  To the chef: until this is fixed, use bottled in the kitchen, it's worth it.

One last note, the water taste has been a consistent issue, I've just always ignored it because we like the food so much and can avoid it with tea or coke.  This last time...it was so bad that it crossed the line and required me to adjust my review.
