We were in last week for a birthday party in the bar area. Unfortunately, I had a pretty hefty sized lunch so I wasn't very hungry when I came in. I ordered the tortilla soup and it was fantastic, one of the ladies at our table thought it was a bit spicy, however, I didn't taste the spice at all. It had a wonderful flavor and the avocado was a great addition to the soup. 

They really made this new location look great. I loved the windows all the way around the restaurant until someone decided they needed to open them. It wasn't warm out, the temps were only in the 60's and it was windy so as soon as the windows opened everyone's napkins started flying around. Most folks appeared to be cold, when people start putting on sweaters/jackets while you're opening the windows, it might be a sign the windows don't need to be open. 

Because of this, I wouldn't be back unless it was warm out for fear of freezing to death.
