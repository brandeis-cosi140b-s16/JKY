our service is always great!! especially yesterday!!
i couldnt decide what kind of spicy cocktail to try ( as i just LOVED the cucumber jalapeno margarita that they unfortunately took off of the menu) and our server offered to ask to see if the bartender would make it for me and he did!!! it made my night, as they are literally my favorite margarita! 
i greatly appreciate little things like that!
being as i work in fashion square, i enjoy occasionally stopping after work with coworkers for some happy hour food or a cocktail, and i honestly really enjoy the great service and makes me feel confident that my clients i refer there for food will always be receiving to same amazing service!!
