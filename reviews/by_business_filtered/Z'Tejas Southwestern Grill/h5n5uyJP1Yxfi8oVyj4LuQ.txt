I love love LOVE this place! Its next to my work which is convenient, but they answer my calls on the first ring, and always provide excellent service and food! Waitresses are very friendly and help me make decisions on what i should order! Their Jerk chicken chowder is MOUTH WATERING! but it is only a special, so i call everyday to see if they have it, and am DYING to have it again. Next time i will order it by the gallon and freeze it im not joking its amazing!!!
