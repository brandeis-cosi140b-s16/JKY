Yelper's unite!! You people were not kidding when you said they have an awesome happy hour and margarita's! As I am a huge fan of margarita's and I believe not many places know how to make them right, Z Teja's did not disappoint. I look for a margarita that is swift to knock you right on your ass. There, I admitted that I like to have the tequila kick when I drink. I had one (ok I lied two) of their raspberry swirl margarita's (which I cannot tell you what the hell they called it) that almost looked too pretty to drink. However, I was disappointed in their nachos as I thought they would have all the glorious toppings besides just black bean cheese and lettuce....come on people step up the Mexican. They also had cornbread which was brought out like bread, and I love cornbread but not sure I liked the actual pieces of corn?! New Englanders are not used to our cornbread that way....But I really think this place has its drinks together, and I wouldn't mind going back again sometime....
