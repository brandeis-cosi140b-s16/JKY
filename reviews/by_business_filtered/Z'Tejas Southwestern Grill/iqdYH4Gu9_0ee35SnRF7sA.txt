Had the breakfast enchiladas, very nice flavor with the red chili sauce and chicken. I subbed in the pan fried breakfast potatoes for the Black beans and yet I still got black beans. Ugh. So I flagged down one of the staff and told them and they promptly corrected the problem, or so I thought. The potatoes arrived ice cold!  So this time the server corrected the problem, or so I thought. She opted to bring me a soup cup of flaming hot potatoes because the cook decided to deep fry them!  I didn't feel like arguing anymore so I finished the enchiladas and called it a day. I don't like shortcuts and feel like they think they fooled me. You won't get the chance to fool me twice!
