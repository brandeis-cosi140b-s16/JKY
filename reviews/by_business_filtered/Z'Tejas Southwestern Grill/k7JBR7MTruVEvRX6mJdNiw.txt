I had to give this place three stars as an average of two and four from the two times I have eaten here. 
The first time service and food were beautiful. Actually, both times service has been top-notch. Never a problem with service. 
I again had the seafood enchiladas which are stuffed with tuna, salmon, spinach, and shrimp. This is really a delicious dish and full of flavor but the second time I had it, every other bite was cold (one hot, one cold, one hot, one cold) - weird. Also, some of the people I was with ordered steaks medium rare. Both came out well. Disappointing. 
They do have this different version of a mojito made with pineapple-flavored rum and mint leaves, with brown sugar. It tastes like candy.
