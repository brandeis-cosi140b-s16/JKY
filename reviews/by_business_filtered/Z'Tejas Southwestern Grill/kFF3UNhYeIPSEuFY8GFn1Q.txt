With the interesting ingredients and combinations listed on the menu, we had expected to be dazzled by the flavors.  Unfortunately, the flavors were very bland and the only dominant one was chipotle.  Chipotle is overdone and overrated in our opinion.  Really expected some unique delicious food and were disappointed.
