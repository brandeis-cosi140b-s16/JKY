Great building, cool place to hang out. But if you are looking for tasty and unique food, you can do much better at many of the other restaurants in the area. They are still trying to get there service techniques down, so it was noticeably chaotic. Also, happy hour specials are nothing to write home about. 

I've been to other Z Tejas's in the valley and found this one to have not as good service and definitely not as good food. 

Regardless it is one of the more unique settings to hang out with big open windows and a glass ceiling.
