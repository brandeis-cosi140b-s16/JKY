I was NOT impressed at all. I was really excited about trying this place because a friend was raving about it. 

My friends ordered two micheladas, the guy asked "do you want the beer mixed with the clamato juice? with lime? with a seasoning on the rim?" we answered "Yes!" When the drinks came, it was just a glass of beer and a side of clamato juice for two beers. We were not aware that they had to share the juice. I asked for a cheeseburger well done, no bacon and it was medium well with bacon. I know I probably won't get sick if I eat pink meat, but that was not what I ordered. One thing my friend did like was the jalape√±o mayonnaise. 

I have to say this place is over priced and not worth my drive. I can get better food and service in Tucson at Sir Vesas.
