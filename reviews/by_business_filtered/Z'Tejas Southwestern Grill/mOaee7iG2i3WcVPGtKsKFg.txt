Came to this location on a hungry-stomach-only-had-chips-and-coffee-for-breakfast-whim and tried the chicken enchiladas and bow tie pasta jambalaya special. First, you get warm corn bread with real corn kernels in it on a iron skillet and butter. Yummy! The Santa Fe enchiladas came with rice and black beans for $11. Let's just say that I've had better. The jambalaya farfalle has shrimp, chicken, andouille sausage, peas, peppers and onions packed with flavor and spiciness for $16. Note to self: never get the enchiladas.
