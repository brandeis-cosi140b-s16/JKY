Very good food, superb bartender, and very tasty margaritas. Great happy hour prices!  First time I was here for lunch with my husband I had the blackin catfish taco. Excellent. And my husband had the z burger n loved it. Sexing time I came with my son for happy hour and we had street tacos. Very good also.
