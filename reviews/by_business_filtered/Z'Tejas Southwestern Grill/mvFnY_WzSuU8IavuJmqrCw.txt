One word. Cornbread. Several more....

This place was awesome. I'm not one for chains, but I am one for strong drinks, good food, and my awesome friends.

Last night, I met up with friends at Z's. Had a long week at work, so I figured, let's go balls to the wall.

The Vodka Sodas are remarkably strong. Typically at chains, you get a few drops of vodka flavoring. These were NO JOKE. Leave your amateur cards at home.

The ahi tuna appetizer, pulled pork nachos, and the cornbread were enough to change my life, both physically and emotionally. Yeah, that damn good. I won't write about the cornbread, because I want you to try it for yourself....write a Yelp review...and then give me credit. While you are at it, give my friend and fellow Yelper Sarah W. credit as well, because she is the one that turned me on to it.

Want a Mojito that will open your mind to a higher power? Try the Tropical Guava Mojito. Guava rum, X-rated fusion liqueur, monin mojito, mint, lime, soda and sprite. Yeah. 

Like I said....happy hour on a friday was balls to the wall.

Get some. This is the spot. Thank God there is one in Scottsdale.
