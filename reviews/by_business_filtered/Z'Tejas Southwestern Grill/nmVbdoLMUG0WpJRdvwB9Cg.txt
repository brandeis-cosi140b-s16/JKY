I have been here a few times and it has never failed to disappoint.  The margaritas are pretty good but not the best I have had.  Their bloody mary's are average even though there is a website that says it is one of the best bloody mary's in town.  The chicken tortilla soup is outstanding! I do not normally like soup from restaurants, but this one is the best I have ever had.  I have had a few entrees but none of them very memorable.  The only reason why I give this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 is because every time I order the soup to go, it is usually pure broth.  When I eat in the restaurant, however, it is a full meal with plenty of chicken.  I do not think it is fair to pay and tip for a to go order for about $10 when I end up just paying for broth.  Great place overall, though.
