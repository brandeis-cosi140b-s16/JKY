They have a good happy hour, even on Sundays.  However the nachos left a lot to be desired. They had little to no flavor, and there was very little cheese.  I've eaten here before and I really enjoyed that dish, but I won't doing the nachos ever again.

I usually sit at the bar when I go out to eat because you always get a chance to meet interesting people. David, the bartender is a real sweetheart!!  if I wasn't 45 years old, I would have made a move on his young, cute ass!!  Oh yeah, back to the food...not a bad place for Tex-Mex!!
