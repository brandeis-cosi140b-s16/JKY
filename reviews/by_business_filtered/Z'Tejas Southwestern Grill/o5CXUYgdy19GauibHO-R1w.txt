First of all, the ambiance can be the sole reason why anyone should visit.  The food was tasty all around and our server was both helpful and thoughtful.  It wasn't packed for a Thursday evening.  We made it there an hour before HH ended and we were quite happy with our margaritas.  Surprisingly, I didn't break into a sweat trying to find parking.  It was a real chill night.  So, go there!
