We have not eaten at a Z'Tejas in many years. We were very pleased with the decor, service,food and prices. Dining on a Friday evening we expected to have to wait to be seated, but were seated immediately. The food was excellent. I have food allergies, the server was very helpful. Dinner for two without drinks was less than $34.00.
