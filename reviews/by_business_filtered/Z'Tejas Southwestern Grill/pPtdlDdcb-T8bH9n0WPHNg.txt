I was really looking for some old fashioned good Mexican food. After searching many restaurants, we decided on Z Tejas because it was close to the resort we were staying at. I have to I was pleasantly surprised. Although this is not traditional Mexican food, it was tasty. I ordered the Green chile babacoa enchiladas, the sauce was good, could have done without all the extra foo foo but the enchiladas themselves were very good. My husband ordered the Smoked Chicken Enchiladas which he enjoyed ( a little too much smoke on the chicken for me). Service was good, food was delivered extremely fast and was piping hot. We ordered the appetizer of the bottomless chips and salsa, with 3 different salsas, salsa rojo, salsa verde and another red salsa that was very spicy. All in all this was a good experience.
