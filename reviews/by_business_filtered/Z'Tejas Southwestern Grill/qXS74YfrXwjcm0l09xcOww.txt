we use to come here quite a bit for their happy hour specials. it's been a while since we've eaten a full meal here, but it left me feeling a little sad. 
only because when you open the menu, it feels like Chilis or Applebees. it has similar layout, feel, and seemed like, food options as well. 

my dish was fine, but i can't remember it. my wifes trout was actually very tasty. they offer a 550 calorie or less menu and they still have those excellent chambord margaritas. but i think we may keep our z-tejas for happy hours.
