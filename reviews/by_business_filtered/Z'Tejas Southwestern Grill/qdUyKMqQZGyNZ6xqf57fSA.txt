Awesome dinner!

Arrived at 9p, which was the start of their reverse happy hour (9p-close).  They provided skillet- fired cornbread and chips w/ 3 different salsas as comped apps. Wide variety of apps, salads, and dinner choices.  I chose 2 items off the discounted happy hour menu, smoked chicken quesadilla (7 on 10 pt scale) and bartender Mike recommended fish tacos (15 on 10 pt scale!!!!).  I had more food than I could eat in 2 sittings and fish tacos were the best I've ever ordered anywhere!! Had 2 margaritas (average) which were also discounted on reverse happy hour menu.  Escaped completely full with enough leftovers for 2 meals and a total bill of $22.  Couldn't be more satisfied!

Highly recommend fish tacos and Z'Tejas!!
