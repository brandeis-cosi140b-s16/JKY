Z'Tejas never fails to impress, tonight's experience was equally satisfying. Z'Tejas has the best frozen margaritas I have ever tasted in my life. My personal favorite is the Patron Fruzion, but be careful these things pack a punch and the policy is to cut you off at 3.

The Tejas Trio is another must. Hand-hacked guacamole, salsa, and cheese dip served in a hot cast iron skillet. I almost always get the Jerk Chicken salad, but I get the seared Ahi instead of chicken.

The fajitas here that have been recently added back to the menu are absolutely amazing. I also love the Barbacoa beef enchiladas with the green chili sauce. I also recommend the chicken tortilla soup which is loaded up with chicken, cheese, and avocados. The also have a Diablo pasta dish which is really good too, it's a jalape√±o cream sauce with chicken over fettuccini noodles.    

I've never had an item on the menu I haven't liked. The biggest struggle for me if what to order because everything on the menu is so amazing.
