What an amazing place. We have been to Z Tejas many times. Our waiter Alex gave us exceptional service. He is the reason why I'm writing this review. From start to finish it was the best service we've ever had at a restaurant. Not only was the food absolutely delicious. But we were not rushed to leave either. We usually are rushed to leave
at restaurants because of our two-year-old. Alex made us feel completely comfortable. We didn't  didn't realize it was happy hour he told us all about the specials. Reminded us of their brunch specials the next day.  It was such a wonderful experience but I had to write about it.
