Had a great experience at this location. First impression of the design and decoration was amazing. We sat next to a wide open accordion window so we could enjoy the wonderful weather and open air. I ordered the BBQ burger and it was honestly one of the best burgers I gave Ever had. The BBQ sauce mixed with the pickles, bacon, and jalape√±o sauce was great. I had a great time and the staff was very attentive and nice. I will go back.
