Zensational is Z'Tejas!  

So glad one has opened up in Central Phoenix!  So the Chambord Margarita is my new favorite drink there for sure.  Sweet yet not over sour like other margaritas they serve.  

Our server or servers were awesome and on the ball the entire evening.  The evening started with two of us then grew to four.  We ordered off of the happy hour appetizers menu which were really great deals for what you receive.  

Loved the dumplings! They were filled with chicken and mini shrimps then seared on the bottom in a cast iron skillet.  We the pork tostados were probably the least favorite of the entrees we ordered.  The trio nachos was a good appetizer to being with. 

Overall , I had a great first experience at this location.  The only thing that really destroys the evening, is trying to find parking.  Other than that, this location is huge and looks like a great place with bigger groups!
