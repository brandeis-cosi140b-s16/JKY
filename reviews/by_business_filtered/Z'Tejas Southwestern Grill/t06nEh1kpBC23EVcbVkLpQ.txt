Love the cornbread.  Hot and it has pieces of corn in the cornbread.  Great starter snack.  
I went with duck tacos, which was a special that day, Sweet and spicy meat with fresh ingredients to cool the spice down.
I also enjoyed the Chicken Jerk salad, on the spicy side for me, but I endured the spice since the flavor of the salad was great.  
I also enjoyed an afternoon beer with my lunch and it overall is a great lunch experience.  I would dine here again, I went with the waiters suggestions and it turned out great.
