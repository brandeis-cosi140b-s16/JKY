Met a friend for reverse happy hour on a Friday night.  I ordered the skinny cucumber mule and the street tacos.  The mule was refreshing. And for only $5, you can't go wrong.  It's a smaller mule than what I am used to, but that's okay.  The street tacos were good too.  It four small steak tacos with avocado, cheese and some sort of pink sauce on top.  And of course you get that delicious corn bread.  Reverse happy hour starts at 9pm.
