As PF Chang's is to oriental cuisine, Z'Tejas is to Southwestern.  Same idea.

I didn't say it was a good idea.  It's ok, not great.

PF Chang's pulls this trick off wonderfully.  Z'Tejas, not so much.

We went for lunch and were seated immediately.  The place we had originally planned on going had a line out the door.  

This is a huge restaurant and beautifully appointed.  Servers were all nice and did a good job.

It's a little dark in here.  It was lunch and had numerous windows but unfortunately we were not seated near them. I had trouble reading the menu.

The corn bread and butter starter is a nice touch.  Everyone likes a freebie.  It just wasn't that tasty.  Nothing special.

I went with a dish off their "seasonal" menu and it did not disappoint.  That being said, it wasn't overly special either.  The beans and rice were okay also but again, nothing special.

The bill came quickly and we were out the door in less than 45 minutes.  Very efficient.

Not the best southwestern food I've had but it's decent.  Don't expect much.
