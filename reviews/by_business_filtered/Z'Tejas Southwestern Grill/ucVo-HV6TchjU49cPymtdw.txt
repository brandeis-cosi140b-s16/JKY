Excellent customer service! Seated right away, the staff was very friendly. She brought the cornbread with mouth watering honey butter that just melted in your mouth. I had the steak salad AMAZING!  My mom had the chicken quesadilla appetizer it was happy hour, but she couldn't finish it. It's a meal. 
Wonderful place my mom can't wait to go back. Me too.
