So...I'm not usually one to frequent corporate restaurants....but I can't stay away from those dang frozen margaritas! If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't eat here half as much. I would give the menu 3 stars, but there are two great things on the menu. The chili pork verde and the diablo chicken pasta. Can't go wrong there...and the Tejas trio is great to snack on if you just want a small bite.
