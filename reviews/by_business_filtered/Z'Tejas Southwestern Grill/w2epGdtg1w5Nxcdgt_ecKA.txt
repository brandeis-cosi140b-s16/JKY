We have gone to Z Tejas many times over the years and have always enjoyed our meal.....Satisfied....not impressed I should say.  However, something has breathed new life into this restaurant .  Our visit this week was exceptional!  My wife's steak was prepared perfectly and the meat quality was noticeably better than we remembered.  The vegetable slaws were crisp and fresh tasting and the mushroom enchiladas were nothing short of famous!   We enjoyed the tostada bites and pan seared dumplings as appetizers and they were spot on !  The prices have gone up but so have my expectations.  The quality is much better and ZTejas is now back on top of my favorite places list!  Keep it up Z !!
