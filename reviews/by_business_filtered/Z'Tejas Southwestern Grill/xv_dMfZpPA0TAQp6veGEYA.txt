Had a lunch meeting here today with a group of gals. We got the back room and 2 waiters.

Food was great. I had the street tacos - super yummy! The waiters were perfect. Attentive nd respectful of our meeting. Kept drinks full with minimal interruption. 

The menu looked tasty, I'm sure I'll take my husband back!
