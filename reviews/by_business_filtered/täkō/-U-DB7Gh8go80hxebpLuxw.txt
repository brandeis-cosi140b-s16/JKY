There is not a single thing I would change about my experience here. Between the unique guac selections, expertly crafted cocktails, and fantastic tacos, the food/drink is all superb. I had no idea what I was missing in my life until I ate octopus tacos.

In addition, the overtly Hispanic Catholic (somehow both respectful and wink / nod) themed decor is outstanding, the full-view kitchen is boisterous and entertaining to watch, and the sound system runs an amazing playlist of 90's hip hop that I am very down with.

This is the best meal I've had in 6 months, and immediately became one of my favorite food joints in the city.
