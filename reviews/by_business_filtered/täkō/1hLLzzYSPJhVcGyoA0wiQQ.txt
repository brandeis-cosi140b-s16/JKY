Definitely overhyped and overpriced, but the food wasn't that bad.

They have excellent toppings and sauces for their tacos, but the meat itself wasn't that great. They're elote (corn) is not traditional, but very very good! If you're looking for some good traditional tacos, don't come here. If you're looking for some fusion and somewhat creative tacos, come here! 

This place is way overpriced. Then again, maybe it's because Pittsburgh doesn't have many taco places. 

Coming from LA, I'm not very familiar with the taco scene in Pittsburgh. But I've had better tacos for 1/5th of the price in LA, NY, and of course Mexico.
