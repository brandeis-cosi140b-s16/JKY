First and foremost the staff here are awesome and you can't teach awesome. The food is impeccable. I had the chicken tacos and they were packed with authentic Mexican flavor.  The atmosphere is one of a kind and the music is a great selection.  I would recommend booking a reservation as the line was already long when the doors opened. It was like lining up to go the club. I would also recommend that you try their Sangria because it's to die for. I will be back with all my friends because this place is a gem.
