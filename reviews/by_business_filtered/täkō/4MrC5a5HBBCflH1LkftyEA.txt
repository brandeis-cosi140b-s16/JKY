If I could give this place 6 stars, I would. The atmosphere was perfect. Such a cool mix of classy yet urban street vibe. From the dim lighting and unique light fixtures, to the balcony railing and booths upstairs ... It all just made the dining experience that much better. 

But most importantly, the food. The guacamole MTO menu was awesome. We got the traditional guac with just one added item and it was delicious. The papas bravas were also a 10. Perfectly cooked, not too spicy, with just the right amount of some sort of special sauce on top. Last, the pollo asada tacos had so much flavor. For two fairly small tortillas, they packed so much inside and the flavor combination was great. 

Lastly, the cocktail of the day was a frozen margarita with cinnamon and fireball, which also exceeded my expectations. 

If I only had room for dessert... I would have ordered the churros funnel cake. I guess I'll have to go back again?
