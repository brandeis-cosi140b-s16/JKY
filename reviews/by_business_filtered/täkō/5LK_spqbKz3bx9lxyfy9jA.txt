Let me start by saying the service from Jasen was excellent. His service was a great way to start and finish our meals. Now for the food and drink. Wonder selection of margaritas as well as other specialty drinks. They do make a good cocktail. As for the food we had guacamole with tuna belly and it was excellent. They have a guacamole menu nice idea. As for the Tako themselves great mix of flavors and as all places some better then others but if you try a new place try something new. The winner last night was the mushroom taco. Absolutely  wonderful. Overall I would say try it you should enjoy. But if you are looking for a quiet place to have dinner this would not be the place.
