Tako was one of the best dining experiences Ive had since I moved up here close to three years ago. The food was top notch, prepared exceptionally with tremendous attention to detail. Everything my girlfriend and I ordered was delicious. We highly recommend the Baja Fish Tacos, Korean Tacos and Street Corn.

We will be back!
