First off, the food is excellent. We started with the guacamole and the extremely helpful waitress helped us with the extra fixings. We shared the duck taco as well as the surf and turf taco that happened to be the special that evening. Both were incredibly tasty but also pretty spicy. My wife and I enjoy spicy food so we were okay, but it might be a bit much for someone who is a bit sensitive. 

The only issue we had was with sitting at the outside bar. We did not have any reservations but took a chance. We were told when we go there that it was "first come first serve" with the outside tables/bar.  However, that is not necessarily the case. When a couple stood up, we took our seats and were almost immediately questioned by TWO managers if we were supposed to be there. Apparently, "first come first serve" means you still have to wait until you get called by the hostess. It doesn't make much sense. A little frustrating, but oh well. It was worth it.
