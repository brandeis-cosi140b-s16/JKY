Very impressed with this place! It's officially our new favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.

Damien, our server was excellent! Very informative and friendly. The ambience is great! They had a DJ on the Friday night that we were there, and it felt like that place should've been turned into a fancy club after dinner hours! It is a bit loud for conversations, but we didn't mind that!

The tako tacos are a must try - I've never had octopus so tender before, and the combination of flavors was just divine! We also had the Korean and Baja tacos. Both excellent - impressive combinations of flavors. One thing to note - the wagyu on the Korean tacos are deep fried. It was excellent, but I would like to try something grilled in the future as the Baja fish was also deep fried. 

We ordered the Korean buns to start, but this did not agree with our tastes. Stick with the tacos and you'll have an amazing dinner.

The cocktails are amazingly crafted, well worth the $10 price for quality. We had the frozen pumpkin margarita and spicy passion fruit margarita, both excellent!!

I have already made my next reservation seeing as they're booked a month in advance, but I cannot wait to go back for more tacos!
