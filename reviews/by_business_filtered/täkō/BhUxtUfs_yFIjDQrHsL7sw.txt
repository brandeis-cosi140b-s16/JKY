AMAZINGNESS!!!  My husband and I ate here last Friday.  It was opening week, so they weren't taking reservations but we showed up at opening (5 pm) and got a table no problem.  The cocktails were the best part--they are all unique and many have mezcal (a smoky tequila, YUM!), which is a rare find in PGH.

We split chips and salsa, and each got an order of tacos.  I got the baja tacos (tempura fish) and my husband got the Korean tacos.  Everything was really good.  None of the salsas were too spicy, but they have homemade hot sauce they will bring out to you also, which has a kick.  Everything is made fresh and so delicious!  If I could say anything bad (and I really can't), they aren't many veggie options--there was a mushroom taco, but it had huitlacoche (corn fungus) as part of the plate and I wasn't feeling quite that adventurous. :)

We also shared the tres leches pie for dessert.  It was good--not my favorite dessert ever, but definitely delicious, and the desserts are big enough for two.

I love the decor--nautical meets street art meets gothic cathedral?  It's gorgeous.  We will definitely be back again and again.  Love tako!!!
