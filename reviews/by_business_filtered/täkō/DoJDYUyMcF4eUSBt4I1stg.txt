Visited here expecting an incredible meal and tako certainly delivered just that! 

The spicy passion fruit margarita was sweet, tangy, and spicy! Very delicious. For the meal, we had the original "tako" taco, which is an octopus taco and also the special, which was an Asian inspired pork belly taco. The octopus was so tender; you never would've known it was octopus! The fried chickpeas on it were also delicious. But I must say, the pork belly taco blew it out of the park!! It was cooked perfectly, the veggies were crisp and tangy, the kimchi was a perfect addition to the rock pork belly, and the sweet miso glaze paired well! Overall, the tacos were great. 

We also had the street corn, which was rich and good for sharing! The queso fundido was also delicious, and was also topped with their homemade chorizo and peppers that were delectable! The only complaint was that there a little bit too much cilantro on the queso, but that can be easily overlooked with all the other amazing qualities of the meal. The service was awesome as well!!! Definitely will go back and would recommend to anyone looking to try unique, delicious, and interesting good in Pittsburgh.
