Food four stars, service four stars, atmosphere two stars if you like to be able to hear your companion and not have ice-cold A/C shooting down on your head. It's cute, it's funky, but it's more like a nightclub that happens to serve great tacos - if that's your thing, then you will love it!

Tako taco - excellent. Same with duck confit taco. Smoked salmon guac not great. Cocktails spectacular.

Our server would have been a five star but something we ordered never came even tho we asked for it twice - it arrived after we asked for the check.
