This place blew me away. From the friendly service (cheers to you Damien) to the excellent food (the tako taco was a personal favorite), this restaurant is just amazing. I went with a group of 4 so we were able to get a good cross section of the menu. We started with the poke, thrice cooked wings, and the daily special meat lover nachos. Not only were the portions large and filling (the nachos alone could feed an army!), the flavors were intense. Damien our server recommended combining all the sauces and fish for the poke and the suggestion took the flavors to a whole new level. Just thinking about it, I'm drooling. For our main courses, we sampled the carnitas, al pastor, chorizo, Korean, bistec, baja, and my personal favorite tako tacos. As strange as it sounds to have an octopus taco, the flavors were explosive! Each taco had its own personal flair that made it impossible to compare. But the consensus of the table was that there just wasn't a bad taco. Each was spectacular. For dessert, we had the tapioca with passionfruit sorbet (I wanted to take home a gallon of the sorbet because it was so amazing), the churro with in-house prepared ice cream (a delicious treat), and a cheesecake so fluffy, I couldn't believe it. 

The meal was a flavorful roller coaster from start to finish, and if I wasn't so stuffed, I'd get back in line right away. I can't wait to go back.
