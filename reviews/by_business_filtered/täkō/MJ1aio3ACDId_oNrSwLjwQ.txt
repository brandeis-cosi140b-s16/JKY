The pros: 
Oaxaca old fashioned (seriously, try it), reasonably priced Mexican beer, the tacos (especially the Al Pastor pork shoulder and the mushroom), service was great, and enjoyed the ambience (and unique kitchen setup). 

We had an after dinner tequila with their michelada mix (instead of sangrita, which we were told would be on the menu in a week or so), tequila was great, and although it wasn't what we were looking for in a sangrita, the mix was spicy and delicious. We'll probably order a couple of micheladas next time.

The cons: 
The "classic" guac was a little sweet for my taste and didn't have much kick with jalepenos and pickled habeneros. Probably the only thing I wouldn't consider a value at $8 (the rest of the food definitely was) but they do give you a lot of chips. Tequila prices were a little exorbitant for some of the more common tequilas, but the list was fantastic. Just needs a little better value on the 1.5oz pours on the more run-of-the-mill brands.

The octopus "tako" had very tender and delicious meat, but I wasn't a fan of the toppings. Something was a bit gritty (like sand) that was very distracting. 

Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs, so I think we have a good sense of how much to order moving forward, but expect a typical bill of around $60-75 depending on how much you're drinking. We'll definitely be back.
