YUM! I loved it here, but I LOVE this type of food. These are not your average tacos and you will leave thinking of what you want to try next time. This time we just got the trio of chips and salsa, the korrean and baja tacos. The options are creative, yet simple leaving your taste buds happy. Everything was rich in flavor and filling. I had just had guacamole earlier in the day so wasn't feeling it at the time, but build your own guac! By the others sitting near us, it looked pretty amazing. I would suggest making a reservation, because we went on a Tuesday and couldn't get in until 8:45 pm. 
Why not give it 5 stars? Well, it's loud... like VERY loud. So at least you can stuff your face, because a conversation is not easy to have here. I can deal with people loudness, but the music was like a club, which isn't ideal for a meal if you ask me. If they would fix that, this place would be perfect.
The word is out, and it's to go to täkō... and I agree!
