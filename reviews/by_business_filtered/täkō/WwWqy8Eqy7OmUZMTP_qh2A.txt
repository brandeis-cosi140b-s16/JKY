I am officially in love with täkō.  We showed up around 5:00 on a Tuesday to an already packed house, but were able to somehow score a table outside without a reservation (but you should make one, seriously).  Typical Meat & Potatoes, Butcher & the Rye service:  hoverish without being annoying, super helpful.  We had a slew of staff bring us menus, some fine tap, and had our drink orders taken before I could even look at the "make your own guacamole" sheet.  Unfortunately I'm not a guac fan, but it was a really cute idea that you get to fill out this scan-tron menu of traditional and a little bizarre options that come with a box of incredible looking chips.

The special (dollar off) frozen margarita was apple so I jumped on that instantly while +1 opted for a mango Jarritos.  We started with the papa bravas to start which were these confit lil' potatoes in garlic red sauce and a bit of cheese in a silver bowl of my new favorite thing.  I was barely done woofing them down when my pollo asado tacos came up.  Spicy but not hot chicken cooled with avocado and white cheese crumbles.  Somehow the best part were the tender (and really sturdy!!) shells. Pretty traditional compared to other options; the +1 played it safe but spicy too getting the al pastor tacos which were gone before I could even see what was in them--caught a glimpse of beef and pineapple. They were a hit with him.  And not to get tacky, but everything was priced well too.  I actually took one of my tacos home (and not just because I filled up on tequila!).

I grabbed a passion fruit margarita before heading out.  Super sweet but just as good as the apple, although not as unique.  Their frozen margaritas, by the way, are perfect.  Nothing syrupy and heavy on the booze. I really wanted to try the lychee, but I could not have more than two of these guys.  More importantly, I also need a reason to come back as soon as possible.
