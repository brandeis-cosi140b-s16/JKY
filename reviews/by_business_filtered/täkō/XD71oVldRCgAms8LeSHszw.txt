The husband and I dined at Täko last night and had a fantastic evening! The hostess team was bubbly and got us to our table as soon as we arrived. Super cool vibe with great music! On the dark side with great lighting! Our server was prompt and knowledgable! My husband got the sage margarita! Five stars! They have a nice non alcoholic list for folks (like me) who are going booze free for a short period of time ;). The food... A mix of 3 and 5 stars to us. Great flavors but... Soooo extremely spicy/hot! The menu does NOT specify how spicy the food is going to be! We will definitely give Täko another try, especially for drinks!
