täkō is a modern, hip restaurant located in the Cultural District. What appears to be a regular taco place on the outside, is actually a gem in Pittsburgh that's gain lots of traction. The location itself is in a wonderfully bustling part of the city, which brings together a diverse crowd.
I made reservations here about a month before my two friends and I dined here and scheduled a time during the week (a Thursday night). We thought there wouldn't be that many people, but the restaurant was busy. Initially, I thought that the restaurant only had one floor of seating, but there's a lovely second floor that's a lot quieter and has comfortable, spacious booths. Though it was a bit loud, my friends and I could still hold a conversation without bordering on yelling.
My friends and I decided to order the "Build Your Own Guac" as an appetizer and mixed in smoked salmon, green onions, and white onions. The guac was delicious, even with such unusual ingredients, so definitely experiment! A huge highlight of our night were the chips. They were addicting, so it was hard to stop mindlessly munching on them so that we'd have room for our actual meals. My boyfriend and I shared the Korean, Al Pastor, and Bistec tacos. Hands down, the best was the Al Pastor. The flavors were classic mexican but with a fun, unique twist. The Korean and Bistec tacos were good, but my boyfriend and I thought they were a bit too salty.
A few little extra tidbits about täkō: parking is definitely easy, since there are lots everywhere, service is extremely efficient but never overbearing, and reservations are definitely necessary.
Overall, täkō is an awesome place to have a great meal and drinks with friends and it's a place any foodie should experience.
