I was anxiously awaiting the opening of Tako and went with some friends last week. 

The decor has a similar vibe to sister restaurant, Butcher in the Rye. It's very hip, eclectic and sexy. The music is a little loud upstairs but not a huge big deal. They have bar seats outside facing the open kitchen, along with some outdoor tables, which is a great set up on a beautiful day. 

We ordered a little bit of everything from the menu and every single thing we ordered was excellent !!!!! The queso fundido, patayas, guacamole, salsa and the chicken, brisket and mushroom tacos. 

I think this may be my new favorite place !!!
