Loved my carnitas and I had a excellent cocktail along with them. My husband ordered the Tako and the octopus in his first taco was chewy but his second was perfect. My main complaint was that the music was way too loud. I had to yell across the table to talk with our friends, but we would definitely enjoy the food here again.
