The food was absolutely sensational. My mouth waters just thinking about the Kale salad.  The restaurant is casual and delightful, and the decor is fun.  I would have given this SIX stars except for the noise. The noise inside is unbearable. PLEASE turn it down.  It's the level of a dance club not a restaurant/bar and I feel like my ear drums were damaged. Perhaps the staff are all already hard of hearing?
