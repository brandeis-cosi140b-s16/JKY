Well, they've done it again... did you think they wouldn't? They, being Richard Deshantz and Tolga Sevdik, owners of Meat and Potatoes and Butcher and the Rye. I'm not joking when I say they've got this down to a science. Cook awesome food, offer a hip environment, great cocktails and you win.

I've been there a handful of times already, always sitting at the bar. Why? Because their cocktails are killer, yes, but also because I never think to make a reservation, which you must do at least two weeks in advance (maybe even three if you want a weekend date). 

It's TINY, like really tiny! half the size of Butcher and maybe offering about 20 tables. So that's why you have to wait for a table and make a reservation. But TOTALLY worth it! The taco's aren't priced too bad, in my opinion. They're hardy and you get 2 for around $10ish. My fave so far... the mushroom taco. Sounds weird, but it was so delicious. The best way to experience a mushroom in my opinion. So good... I seriously dream about this taco! 

I've also had their gauc, which come in various forms that you can choose from. I went with the classic, and while it was good, it's a tiny portion for around $8. I probably scooped half the bowl on one chip, which is partly my fault! 

I'm excited to finally sit at a table soon, so watch out for a full dinner recap soon!
