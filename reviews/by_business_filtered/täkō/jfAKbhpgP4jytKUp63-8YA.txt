Great tacos (although I think people either love or hate the octopus... personally not a fan).  The restaurant is a lot bigger inside than it appears from the street, and has a neat atomosphere, and they have some really fun and different cocktails! The only reason I woulnd't give 5 stars is that it's a little overpriced for tacos.
