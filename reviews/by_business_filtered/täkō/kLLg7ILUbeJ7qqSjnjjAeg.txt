My two friends and I made our reservation about a month in advance for 8pm on a Thursday night. We got in, and it was, as expected, really crowded. Once we were seated on the much quieter second floor overlooking downstairs, we dived straight into the menus. 

A mix of good and bad, but mostly good. The apple cranberry margarita I ordered was strong, but I could not taste the apple cranberry at all. It tasted more like raspberry to me? We created our own guac to share and added smoked salmon, corn, and onion. We thought the salmon would be raw, but it wasn't. Still good, but a little disappointing. But their chips are tasty!

My chorizo tacos (chorizo, egg, cheese, cilantro) were great other than the mysterious sweet flavor that bothered me a little, partly because I didn't know where it was coming from. The tacos are not large, but I'd say two of them plus sharing an appetizer and dessert are perfectly enough for dinner. The churro/funnel cake we got for dessert was not good. I wanted it to be hotter and crispier, and I didn't think the fruitiness worked well with the rest of it. 

Interesting decor, good service, and good tacos.
