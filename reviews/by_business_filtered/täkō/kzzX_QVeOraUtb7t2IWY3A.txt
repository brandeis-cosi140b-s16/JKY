We tried to get a seat as walk-ins on the first night, bad idea. So we went to Butcher next door and I grumped about it. I was a little salty but I came by for a second attempt on night number 2. We waited just a few minutes and somehow managed to get a table. Maybe they could tell I was desperate. The ambience is fantastic and for being the second night the service was flawless. 

We had several types of margaritas. I really liked the frozen passion fruit but if you like cachaca try the pineapple Batida. The custom guacamole is an awesome concept and adding that perfectly cooked bacon along with mango and pineapple was mind altering. The chips were hot and salty and perfect. 

Next came the wings... In a fish sauce caramel. OMG. They're everything I could ever ask for and reminded me of the first fish sauce wings I had at PokPok. All of the tacos were delicious but perhaps a little spicy for the average palate. I like spicy, so a lot of them ended up on my plate. The beef in the Korean taco melted in my mouth and the duck confit was superb. I am so happy I didn't let me first turn away experience stop me. I'm really excited to have a new place to enjoy downtown.
