Well, it was opening night, so things could still go wrong...but I doubt it'll happen, based on how well Butcher and the Rye has held up.

The staff was incredibly nice, and almost too quick to clean off our table (I lost a side plate before I could even stop her). Fortunately, staff is always there waiting to help (plate restored!). The manager was attentive and when I shrugged shoulders for one of my dishes when our waitress asked how it was, he quickly came over to ask what I didn't like, what could be improved, etc. You really can't have a better start, service-wise.

The space is awesome to take in, with the octopus theme running wild. Adventurous concept, visually,  and just over-the-top enough to be a talking point, while never interfering with the experience. It's dark, so expect to bring a light for the menu.

The food was excellent. We had the Al Pastor, Bistec, Tako, and Carnitas tacos. All good, with my only exception being the thick and hard-to-get-through octopus on the Tako taco. Curious if I'll be the only one to make suggestions to the manager on that one. Flavor-wise, it was good. Just texture wasn't ideal. Otherwise, food was spot-on. I'd recommend it all!

Also started with the Asian Bolognese ask the Papas Bravas. We just returned from Barcelona and Bravas'd our faces off, so I can't say they beat our best there, BUT I'd order again. The bolognese was excellent. 

All-in-all, I'm already looking forward to going back. If the service and food holds up like tonight (opening nights are always hit-or-miss), it'll become a staple in our Pittsburgh restaurant shortlist. Enjoy!
