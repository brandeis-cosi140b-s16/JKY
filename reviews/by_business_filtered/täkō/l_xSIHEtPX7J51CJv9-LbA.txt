We went late night but were lucky enough to get a table right off the bat. Tako is very busy, so if you are looking to check it out...make a reservation. We found out about it when we went to Butcher and the Rye and we were so glad- they are both owner by the same company. 

Their appetizers and dessert are extremely good, fresh, high in flavor and all about balance in spice/heat. Decor is fun, trendy and the music was upbeat and fun.

We wents a few weeks back so I don't know the exact name of what we got but the corn appetizer was amazing and I really enjoyed the ahi tuna and pico dish. Really good experience and will go back any chance we get.
