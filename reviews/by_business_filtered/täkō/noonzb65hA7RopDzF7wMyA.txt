Reservations were made weeks in advance via Yelp for a Tuesday night dinner. I was bringing in friends from LA, so I was clearly regretting my decision to take them to a taco shop. These were your gourmet tacos, not street tacos, and each taco order comes with 2 tacos- which are pretty huge.

We started with the Guacamole appetizer- you get a order sheet and check-off the mix-ins that you want. Loved the guacamole, and it came with a lot of chips. The Thrice Cooked Wings were also great- the meat just fell off the bone. The fish sauce taste was distinct, so if you don't like it, don't get it. The wings are given by weight when we asked about how many pieces, and this appetizer was enough for 4 people. 

I got the Baja Taco- tempura white fish with cabbage, onion, radish and jalapeno relish. First thought- the fish is huge!! I loved the slaw on top of the fish, but overall, not really digging the taco overall. The fish was not as crispy as I would've liked, and it got a little soggy. Friends complimented the Bistec as well.
