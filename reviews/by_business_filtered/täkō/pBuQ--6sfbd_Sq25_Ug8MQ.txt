Great experience!  Went on a Tuesday night, they were busy but we had reservations and were seated immediately.  The waiter was professional and took care of things, but was a little overwhelmed, but the other staff and management seemed in sync and helped cover each other to ensure a good experience.  I had the spicy cucumber cocktail which was off the hook, and a great combination of ingredients.  Mexican street corn appitizer was delicious, Tako taco was great, and the octopus was cooked better and more tender than any octopus i've ever had.  Pollo asado taco was very good also, chicken was tender and seasoned perfectly, more traditional taco than to tako.  Also had the special Bo saam taco which wasn't bad, but the kimchi really overpowered the whole dish and couldn't taste the fried oyster or pork shoulder. Being that it was a special item, and still tasted good, didn't feel necessary to go down a star.  Will be back soon!  (Side note: restaurant was noted as not kid friendly, but if you're little one is not a picky eater and well behaved, you'll be fine, our daughter enjoyed the experience as well!)
