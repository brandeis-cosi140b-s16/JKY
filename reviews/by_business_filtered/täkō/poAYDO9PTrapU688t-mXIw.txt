Based on the reviews I had to try this place!
Wow! What an amazing place. From the second we arrived to the end of dessert it was one of my favorite meals in a long time. To start I had the passion fruit margarita which was sweet and spicy and plenty of tequila. We ordered the chips and the homemade guacamole which was with out doubt the best I've ever eaten
Then we had the queso fundido which was spicy and rich and very tasty, two perfect apps for a table of 4.
Then we all had the tacos.... I had the bestik which was waygo beef and spices outstanding my wife had the mushroom which was incredible and my kids both had the pollo which may have been just a bit too spicy for their tastes
Some of the best tacos I've ever had, but the atmosphere made the meal!
Cool music, cool art work and exceptional service. Our waiter Damian knew every bit of the menu and was super helpful this being our first time. He was fast and friendly and very knowledgable.
Reservations are a must unless you sit outside on the sit up bar which fills up fast
I can't wait to return to try every taco o the menu!
