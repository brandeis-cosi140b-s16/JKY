I was in Pittsburgh for 4 weeks in total for business.  Of that 4 weeks I've visited tako 5 times.  It's not because it was located down the street from my hotel or because there was any lack of choices when it came to dinner.  It was simply because they have really GOOD food here.

Over the span of my 5 visits I've had a chance to try the beet "faux" tartare, Ahi Tuna poki, octopus taco, fish taco, and the waygu short rib taco aka "The korean".  Out of everything I've tried what kept me going back was in fact the Korean.  I've only scratched the surface when it comes to trying everything on the menu but I now I can't go wrong with the Korean.

I prefer to sit outside in the stool but sometimes I've had to sit inside at the bar.  The service outside is lackadaisical - it's like they forget you're even there.    But it's worth seeing the chefs in action.  Sometimes it is tough to get a seat/table so plan ahead.
