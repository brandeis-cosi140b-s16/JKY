TAKO is awesome and  beyond! The open kitchen, the extremely fresh food, the management and waitstaff went above my expectations! We tried a little of everything...salsas, guacamole, queso....wow! The carnitas taco was bursting with fresh meaty flavor. Definitely will return and return ....and return!
