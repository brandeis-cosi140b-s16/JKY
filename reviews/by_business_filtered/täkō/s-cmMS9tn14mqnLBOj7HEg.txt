What a great find! I am from the Southwest and I take my tacos very seriously, so I will admit I was skeptical, but I left feeling very impressed. I'll start with the disappointments. The white sangria was incredibly sweet, fake-tasting, and had no discernible booze in it. My other complaint: large chunks of canned pineapple in the Al pastor, bummer. But the highlights far outweighed my disappointments. After I finished my sangria I ordered a Spicy Cucumber marg which was wonderful, well-presented and sublimely spicy! I like the build-your-own-guac concept a lot. My boyfriend is a quac newbie so we got the classic but substituting fried onions for fresh and added shishito peppers. Absolutely fantastic! We ordered the street corn, which came off-the cob (cue skepticism) but was really, really delicious. It was like if Elote was Mac n cheese. Good stuff. Pineapple aside, the Al pastor was well-seasoned and perfectly cooked. So were the Carnitas. In my opinion, all-around a great job of high end tacos which retained a good bit of authenticity. We'll be back!
