Had an awesome time. Tried the Street Corn and Wings as the appetizers. The corn exceeded my high expectations. Shared the Al Pastor and Duck Confit tacos, which were great as well. Only thing I would have changed (and this is extreme knit picking) is the duck on the tacos was in big chunks, which made it hard to bite at times. I'm more of a beer guy than cocktails, but opted for the Grapefruit Sage Margarita and it was fantastic. Will be back!
