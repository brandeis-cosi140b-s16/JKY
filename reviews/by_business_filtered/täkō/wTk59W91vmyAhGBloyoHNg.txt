OMG, I regret waiting so long to go there because I feel like it's days I've missed that I could have been eating there!! 

I've proclaimed it as one of the top 3 meals I've had this year!  

We started with the corn and wings and I had the duck tacos for my main course. It's going to be hard not to repeat this EXACT meal every time I go back because it was SO good. 

I haven't even mentioned the decor and atmosphere, it's not like nothing else in Pittsburgh and I really think it sets a new standard. I just hope others can keep up. :)
