We were able to walk in and get seats at the bar on a Thursday night, so that's one way to get around the long lead time needed for reservations. I expected it to be good, but it really blew my mind. The street corn appetizer was fantastic, thankfully we had chips to scrap up any sauce or cheese that didn't make it onto the corn. And the Tako Tacos were incredible. Best octopus I've ever had, just a completely different texture from calamari or even high quality grilled octopus. I told the bartender I was angry at every other octopus I've ever had for being so bad in comparison. The care and effort they put into everything from the tortillas to the ailois to the octopus was really evident. 5 stars. Now if I could just get a table, I'd go back all the time...
