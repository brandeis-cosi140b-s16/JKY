Worst service ever....TWICE!  Food is fair at best!  We were so excited when this restaurant was being built...we couldn't wait to try it once it opened.  We gave it a few months after it opened to try it out.  We went with another couple and sat outside.  We sat outside forever it seemed.  No chips, no water ....no waiter/waitress.  Finally my husband went in to find someone and it was the hostess who finally brought waters and chips.  There were 2 other parties on the patio so it wasn't a matter of the patio being closed.  Our wait staff was just no where to be found.  UGH!  The hostess took our orders finally.  Let's just say....the food was fair at best and they never came back to see how it was or to give us the bill.  We again....finally just decided to get up and head for the door thinking maybe someone would help us.  NOPE....hostess, say's 'bye, thanks for coming".  We were like....um, did you want us to pay???  No one has brought us our bill and we've been done with our food for over 15 minutes!  We asked for the manager and told her we wanted to pay our bill and that the service was TERRIBLE.  She didn't really care.  We paid our bill and left.  We all thought maybe this was a joke, "funniest hidded videos" since it was beyond bad service.  But....alas, it wasn't...it was just bad service.

Well, my husband and I went back a couple months later to try it ONE MORE TIME.  To keep this short and sweet, we actually had a waitress this visit...but, this time the service was bad due to the waitressbeing extremely rude.... in her own words, "she's in a bad mood and having a bad day".  We felt so lucky to get her....NOT!
Oh yeah...trying to keep this short.  We wil NEVER step back into this restaurant again!!!
