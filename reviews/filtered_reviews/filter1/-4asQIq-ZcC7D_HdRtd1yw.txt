Went in for lunch today and had the BBQ steak burrito. I ordered guac and queso on it which was extra and I'm completely cool with that but I ate half the burrito and couldn't see or taste any guac or queso so I went to the counter and asked the girl who made it if she put it on and she said yea and that I was in queso heaven with how much she put on. I go back unfold the entire burrito and definitely didn't see any queso. I couldn't even finish it because it was so dry and bland. Not impressed at all. Sub par burrito and if I'm paying $10 for a burrito I'd like to get the guac and queso that I paid for that was extra. I didn't bother saying anything else because they were so busy but I definitely wouldn't recommend this place and I won't be going back. The steak queso burrito at qdoba is 10 times better. And you actually see queso oozing from your burrito there you don't have to open it up and search for it. This place is incredibly overrated. I think people just think it's cool and give it the benefit of the doubt but in my book if your food isn't good then I don't care how cool your restaurant looks. I could have made a better burrito at home and saved $10. What a waste. Big thumbs down.
