I like the idea of supporting a mom & pop restaurant, but these lunch prices r outrageous. Just a chicken burro with tomatoe, guacamole and green sauce was $16. The high price would have been okay if the taste was amazing. But, it did not taste good. It was one of the most bland burros I have ever had. And there's an old carpet smell when you first walk into the bar area. This place needs a good airing out, steam cleaning, price and menu update with tastier dishes.
