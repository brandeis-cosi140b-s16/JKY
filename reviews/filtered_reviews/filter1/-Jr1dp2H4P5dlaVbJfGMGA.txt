We had breakfast here because it was close to the convention we were attending. The choices are very limited, the service wasn't that great and they are very pricey-even for Vegas. I do not believe my vanilla latte was really that, it tasted more like just coffee. The French Brioche with caramelized plantain syrup was very tasty, although I believe the "plantains" were actually bananas. The music was so loud we asked our server if they could turn it down. After what felt like an eternity it did seem to drop a few notches but only momentarily before the noise level was again unbearable. This is just my two cents, take it for what it's worth.
