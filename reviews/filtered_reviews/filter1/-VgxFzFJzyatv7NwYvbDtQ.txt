This place is a ZERO! I took my husband there for his birthday dinner after a few good reviews. Well, this place was just awful! We waited two hours for a table they do not take reservations. Went to the bar to wait and waited 20 minutes for someone to notice and ask us if we wanted anything** another 25 minutes to receive our drinks a bottle beer and a house Margarita with no straw! Asked waitress to check on our table witch she never did, Three times my husband got up to check, apparently we had been skipped even after checking 3 times.The staff was very roude and unwelcoming. The food was nothing great it was exactly the same as my neighbor hood taqurilla but ten times more expensive. I was very upset ruining my husbands dinner. I will never go back and I will give bad reviews. Do not come here if you want a great Mexican place go to Lindo Michuacan, they should take tips from them*** I hate this place!
