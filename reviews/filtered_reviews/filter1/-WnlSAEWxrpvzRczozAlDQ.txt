Went here for a family member's birthday dinner. It was not enjoyable. I'm going to make this review short and sweet.

Meat- we had both chicken and steak. Chicken is flash cooked which makes it dry and flavorless. Steak was full of fat and tasted VERY similar to cheek meat. 

Tortillas- were great. We had both flour and corn.

Salsa- tasted sweet and like it was missing something. Also had that weird tomato sauce for tacos, it was awful and did not enhance the taco flavors.

Potatoes- which are $6.00, were dry and lacked flavor. Even my potato loving husband and grandfather didn't like them and that was a SHOCK! 

We didn't think this place lived up to the hype. We won't be returning. We prefer Gallo Blanco in PHX for some amazing street tacos!
