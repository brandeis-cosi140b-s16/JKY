I have low standards but this place is terrible.

I was starving so stupidly decided to try this place out. Waited a few minutes for a table to clear out (would it kill you guys to hire a hostess?) Sat down at a dirty table, and a guy comes with a wet rag and brushes all of the debris onto the floor. That should have been my hint. to go elsewhere. I ordered wings as an appetizer. Wings were lathered in a spicy sauce that masked the fact that they were overcooked. I forgot what I had for an entree but it was unremarkable I'm sure. Drinks were cheap, I guess. Food was overpriced for something they probably just microwaved.
