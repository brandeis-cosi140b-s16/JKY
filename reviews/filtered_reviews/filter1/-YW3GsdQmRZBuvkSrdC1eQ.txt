Here's the deal-- this place wants to be authentic like the one in Austin. And it's authenticity doesn't fit for that large a footprint in South Park. The service was average, food was average, salsa's tomatoes were less than red and the guacamole was half lettuce. In general I try to be a positive person and I want businesses to be successful and maybe this will be but enter with a note of caution. They're trying really hard to be unique except what makes things unique in food-- service, quality, speed-- weren't there.
