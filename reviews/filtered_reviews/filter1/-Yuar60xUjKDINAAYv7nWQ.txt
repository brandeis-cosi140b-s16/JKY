We loved Casa Rasta. Went tonight not realizing it had changed. Saw new menu but decided to give it a shot. Casa Rasta had the best fish tacos in the city. Now they have the worst. Omg...so bad!!!! Looks like what was Casa Rasta is now also Las Palmas; a joint ownership. Also...we loved that it was byob.  It will no longer be in a couple of months FYI.
