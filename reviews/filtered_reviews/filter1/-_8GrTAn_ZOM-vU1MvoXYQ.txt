Luckily, there are thousands of places to eat in Vegas.
Unluckily, we chose Diego last Thursday for my brother's pre-wedding dinner (there was no rehearsal, so technically, we can't call it a rehearsal dinner).

There were 10 of us, so we had a private room in the back, which was, frankly, the only nice thing about this meal.

After we were seated, the host asked if we'd like guacamole with our chips and salsa assortment (it came with a pico de gallo, a tomatillo salsa, and a hotter, chipolte-y salsa).  I figured there would be an extra charge - but not a $12 PER ORDER extra charge.  Ridiculous.  They made it fresh, right there at the table, but it was bland and tasted mostly like mayonnaise.  One order wasn't even enough for everyone to get a scoop- I think they used one lousy avocado for that $12 guac.

The meals were definitely overpriced for the quality and quantity provided.  The tamales were bland, the tacos were greasy, the flank steak was overcooked (I ordered it blue rare and it came out medium.  Not medium rare, not rare.  Ew.  I tried sending it back but they couldn't manage to get it even remotely pink the middle.  Disgusting).  About half the table had cold food when it was served (and I don't think the fish tacos were intended to be a chilled dish).

My mom's meal was comped because they gave her the entirely wrong dish but then a server never came back by our table so she never had a chance to point out the error.  So weak.

Nearly $300 for the 10 of us, with no cocktails and just a few beers (thanks to $24 worth of crappy guacamole).  So my vote?  Skip Diego and find somewhere with 1) actual Mexican food, 2) an oven and 3) portions that, if actually edible, will fill you up.
