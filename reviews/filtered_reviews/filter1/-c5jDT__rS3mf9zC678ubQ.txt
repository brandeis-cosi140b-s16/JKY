I won't go back to Richardson's or Dick's Hideaway because of the attitude of the owner. The man is not a nice person and don't let him ever hear you say anything negative, period.  JJ G. says not to get comfortable.  The staff is better about not making sure you are on your way as soon as your finished than it used to be.  Abu J received an email from the owner telling him he is a "loser and a moron" when he reviewed the adjoining Dick's Hideaway, in a way he (the owner) didn't like.  I won't support this man by going back to his establishment.

I should tell you a plus about Richardson's.  Since they passed the law about no smoking in restaurants, you can know smell the food.  It used to be you were hit by a wall of stale cigarette smoke. Anything you wore in there had to be washed when you left it was so bad.

If you like New Mexico style mexican food, the place isn't to bad.  But why would I support a man...well, I could tell you having lived in the neighborhood quite a number of years..  Suffice it to say there are other places to go (and I'm sure they'd have better parking).

I fully expect a hateful email from the owner.  When I get it, I'll post it..
