My family and I ate lunch here for the first and last time. The beans were greasy and the enchiladas were like soup. The burros were alright but I've had much better. I hope that the AC was broken and that it's not always that hot inside. The service was pretty bad to, really slow. I'm giving them one star because the rice was good. I'd say find someplace else to eat.
