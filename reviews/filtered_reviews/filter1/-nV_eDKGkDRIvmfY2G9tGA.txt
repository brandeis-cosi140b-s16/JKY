I was so disappointed!!! We got a great table on the rooftop which made for great people watching and a gorgeous ambiance, however the service on a Saturday evening was less than stellar for a place which such high prices. First, they were out of 2 of the ~8 drinks on their specialty cocktail menu. I had wanted the Se√±orita or the Puncho Villa based on the waiters recommendation even though they were $14 a piece, but was told after trying to order each that both were sold out so I settled for the $9 red sangria. It was small and had a very herbal after taste, so not what I expected. Second, the $25 lobster fajitas only had about 3 pieces of meat. The filet fajitas were also skimpy and had fatty pieces. The guacamole was small but good and much needed since it took so long to get our actual food. Lastly, it took about a half hour to get our check from the waiter and another 20 minutes for him to bring the card back so we could finally leave! I'd go back for a drink on the roof by the fire pit (maybe), but not for dinner. They also have a mechanical bull in the middle of the first floor but I didn't get to see it in action...
