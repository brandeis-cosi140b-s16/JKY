I really try to write reviews that I would find helpful so I will try to be somewhat objective??. Stayed at the Venetian so local of this place was perfect, the decor was interesting and fun but at least at the time we went, was unmatched by the staff and patrons. Portions are small and expensive even by Vegas standards.   It was not very good Mexican food and I left still hungry.  Service was adequate but again by Vegas standards very sub-par.  The server would take our order then walk back and talk to 3 other servers for 20 min.  I was not really annoyed by it, but just sort of amazed given my other experiences at strip restaurants.  We all left with some regrets about wasting a vacation meal here.   Glad I tried it once because I was curious but I will never go back. Way too many other fun places in Vegas with good food to try! If you are in Las Vegas for a limited time, I would advise you to try another place.  There just seems to be nothing special about this place other than overlooking the pirate show at night.
