Negatives:
Hipster hangout. Looks like a 70's lounge. 
The Mexican mule does not deserve the name. It was a passion fruit cocktail in a regular glass with tequilla. No TACO TUESDAY deals! What kind of taco place does not do taco tuesday? Tacos were flavorless except the chicken tinga. 
Servers keep their phones in the retro ice chest at the front of the restaurant (weird, I know). 

Positives:
The Big Lebowski picture
Chips and Salsa
