I'm not sure why this place has so many great reviews. The food was edible. That's about it. Nothing stood out. Personally, I think I could get a more authentic fish taco at Rubio's and a better tasting carnitas burrito at Chipotle--and at 1/2 the price. There wasn't enough flavor or spice or anything, really. Was asked what kind of salsa do I want? Um, I don't know, how about all of them? How do I know which one is best if I can't try them all? Total turn off. My burrito was dry and I didn't like having to beg for more soda. For God's sake invest in a salsa bar & let people get their own soda! One more tip: don't run out of utensils. Especially when customers don't appear to be lining up. When business is that slow, you shouldn't really run out of anything or make your guests wait while you restock the forks.
