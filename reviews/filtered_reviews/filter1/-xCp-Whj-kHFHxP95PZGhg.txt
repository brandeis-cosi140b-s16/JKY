Pretty consistently terrible at making orders in a timely fashion and ringing people up. There are a ton of staff, so the problem is the management. So glad to be moving to another part of town where the service is quick, and can expect to get through a longer line in a shorter time. A week ago my little family was there and we waited 40mins to get through a line that was 15 people deep. How many minutes does it take to make a ding dang burrito (the most complicated item on the menu) when you have ALL of the ingredients in front of you? At this store it takes over 2.5 minutes.

It's just wrong man. I don't know how else to say it. Wrong. Go to the original Cafe Rio and you will see burritos come into form in less than ten seconds. The burrito Nazi will pressure you if you are taking more than a split second to decide, a wonderful experience to know that these people expect as much performance from you as they do from themselves, and you better have your money ready to ring up because you're holding up the line...

...Such is not the case here on Blue Diamond. How can you expect to make money when it takes so long to make the food? Especially when you end up giving away free meals because you took so long! What's worse is that the online orders take precedence.
