Epic Fail!

My wife and I went there for after dinner drinks. I was buying $20 shots of Reserva Familia tequila with soda back. They were charging me $5 per soda, since they did not have a soda gun. Absolutely ridiculous!!! First of all, how can they not have a soda gun at such a nice hotel? In any other bar on planet earth, I get a mixer with booze for free. Javier's is not owned my Aria, so there was no recourse through the hotel management. The bartenders said, 'sorry...that's just how it it here.'

There was no one in the restaurant, even though it was a busy Thanksgiving weekend. Maybe arrogant service and overcharging explains it. I am writing to the hotel about this. It's totally wrong to treat people who are already paying heavily for their vacation like this.
