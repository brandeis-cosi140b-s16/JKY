Just to start, I can not stand when establishments ask "would you like chips and salsa?" only to find that they are a charged menu item.  I understand it is only 1.29$ but that practice is extremely annoying.  

Quesidilla= its melted cheese in a tortilla...not hard to mess up.

Flautas = average

Carne Asada burrito = in the absolute top ten of the worst dishes I have EVER had in terms of mexican food.  The meat was the hardest, most difficult, leather-like cut I have had in years.  I couldn't eat it.  I know going into a mexican food place a 6.50$ burrito is a 6.50$ burrito.  However, after reading a majority of the reviews, I had seriously high hopes.
