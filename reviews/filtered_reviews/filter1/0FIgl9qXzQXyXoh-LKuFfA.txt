Why this place has 4 stars is beyond me. We had a horrible experience from start to finish.

The speaker at the drive thru is useless cuz u can barely understand the broken English through the crackling speaker. 

She got our order completely wrong! No surprise there! 

$3 for a taco? Try $4.50 when they add guacamole with out your knowledge. 

Nothing about this place is authentic. Bottled salsa and pre packages tortillas. Flavorless meat and guacamole. 

Trust me and pass on this trash!!!!
