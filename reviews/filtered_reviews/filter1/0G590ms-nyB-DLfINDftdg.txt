This place is inauthentic, disgusting, greasy, and a waste of money. Unfortunately my friend didn't want to wait in line for good food so we went here because it was empty. That's obviously a sign it's not good.

Greasy nachos with chicken that looked unknown, greasy chips, and everything tasted like lard in a can. Tacos were bland. Service was okay considering it was half empty. This is absolutely atrocious. You would find better food at a Chipotle or something. There's a reason this restaurant is empty compared to a sandwich shop. Never again.
