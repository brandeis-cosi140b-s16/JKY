This was actually the worst service I've ever had in my entire life. The waiter sat us at a table that didn't even have silverware or placemats. I felt like I was being seated at an empty park table. Then it took him 20 minutes to get us water or even acknowledge our existence. After that I ordered a burrito but specifically asked for no cheese because I'm allergic. He gave me a rude look and of course my burrito came back SMOTHERED with cheese on top. After being too hungry to ask to send it back I picked around the cheese. After we were done eating we waited for the check for 45 minutes. I'm not kidding. we were so fed up that we went inside and our server was nowhere to be found. We had to go up to the bar to pay for the meal. At that point I was ready to walk out and not even pay but I am too decent of a person to do that. 

Long story short this was the worst service I have ever experienced and I will not be coming back. Ever.
