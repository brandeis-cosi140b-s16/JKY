I came here with a group of friends on a trip to Vegas and was thoroughly disappointed.  We were expecting a nicer Mexican restaurant considering the prices and food discriptions - but I was less than wowed.

While the waitstaff was nice, the service was very slow.  We waited about 15 minutes for our drinks.  Dinner wasn't great either.

I had the Mexican Chopped Salad which is supposed to include red peppers, tomato, apple, beans, onion, corn, avacado and lettuce.  When they brought it to me I literally thought it was the wrong dish because all I could see was lettuce and chicken.  There were no apples or peppers and a sprinking (I mean like 10 kernals) of corn and beans.  It was laughable and NOT worth $17.

2 girls ordered the Turkey Tostada, which was a cute presentation on two small corn tortillas, but they complained that the turkey was overwhelmingly salty, and avoided it all together.

Others liked the quesadillas and drinks were good, which is why I give this review 1-2 stars.

Had the menu been more appropriately priced I wouldn't have been as annoyed - but I could have found a MUCH better meal for $30 somewhere else.  

Who knew a head of lettuce and a glass of wine could eat up so much money!? ... I should've put it into slot machines, that would've been less of a throw away :)
