Its Saturday night 8:05 pm
There are 4 to 6 obviously very open tables at Leticia's
And they did it again tonight. With open tables everywhere, they said the same thing they always say, "sir, that'll be a 15 minute wait"
This has happened to us at least 6 times, but somehow we keep giving them a chance. Maybe its time to look around.
Folks, if you're interested in a wait for a restaurant that's not busy and blatantly treats the customers to waiting while you stare at lots of empty tables, then this is the place for you. If you're not interested in long waits for no reason, there are lots of other options close by; for example try the place next to Red Robin or if Italian would fit, go across the street to Streets of New York.
