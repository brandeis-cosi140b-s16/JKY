this place is ridiculous.
ive had pretty mediocre food from here a few times, but its down the street from my house so i think i just keep hoping it will get better. The Carne Asada is totally bland. And their quesadillas are practically inedible. The one good thing is their salsa and bean dip.

So I just called to place a take out order for a side of bean dip. The woman informed me that chips do NOT come with the bean dip and it would be $1.99 extra for them (Do most people eat bean dip WITHOUT chips?). Ok. Fine. I will pay the $1.99. Then i ask if salsa is included with the cost of chips, to which she replies no, salsa is extra as well. I hung up. Everything they were trying to charge me for is FREE if i was going to sit there and eat my bean dip! 

I think i have finally given up on this place
just go to cheba hut next door ;)
