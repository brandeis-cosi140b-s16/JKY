Food was great. Tamales were tasty and the rice tasted just like my moms. But there was one major problem today when I went in by myself for lunch... 
I got up to use the restroom and when I came back, a family of 4 was sitting at my table and my food was gone! I was livid! I literally had excused myself for 2 minutes. The girl in the front didn't offer an apology and the manager did nothing about clearing my table and food.
 Food is good. Customer service is terrible!
