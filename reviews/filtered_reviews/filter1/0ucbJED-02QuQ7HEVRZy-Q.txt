I'd just like to start off by saying I came to Vegas celebrating my birthday with a large group of family this past weekend. We had heard great things about this restaurant and since we were staying at the Hard Rock hotel, we figured, why not? Arriving to the hotel from a long drive, my group and I were beyond hungry. As expected at a restaurant on a Friday night, we did expect a wait to get seated and for the food to take some time. First off, we had waited about forty-five minutes to more than an hour to receive our food. But before receiving any plates on the table, we had asked our waitress how much longer we had before our food came out. No reply or acknowledgment. The waitress ignored at least three of my cousins who asked and walked away. We kept waiting with our growling tummies until another cousin of mine walked in to ask another waitress. That same waitress spoke to her manager and from reading the manager's lips, he said "fuck it." Whatever that meant, it confused some of us. Soon after, another waitress who apparently was a manager herself barged in to our sitting area to check out what the issue was. We told her and responded with, "Smile, youre in Vegas.... bitch." Regardless whether you're in Vegas, New York City or Los Angeles, there is no need to wait over an hour for mediocre food. Or to even receive that type of attitude/service. Mind you, when the food was finally sent out, it tasted as if they warmed it up in the microwave. End of story, horrible service, mediocre food, poor management. Pink taco needs to step it up, "you're in Vegas!"
