This is not a review about the food because there was no room at the inn.  I walked into barrio queen at a little after 6:00 pm on a saturday--I would say there were people at a third to half of the tables--the hostess says they are completely booked for the evening and could not take walk-ins until at least 9--walked down Stetson--and there were tables at several other restaurants in the neighborhood--if they had tables I find it difficult that barrio queen was completely booked even though they were half empty.  not sure I will try again.
