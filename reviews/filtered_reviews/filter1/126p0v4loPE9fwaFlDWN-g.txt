Don't get all the hype. Authentic tacos ...I DON'T THINK SO. . Food was mediocre at best.  Carne Asada was fatty and chewy...al pastor was dry with no flavor and the chorizo was average..If you're looking for Great tacos in Vegas you should  try  (Frijoles and Frescas).. Unfortunately we will not return to tacos El Gordo
