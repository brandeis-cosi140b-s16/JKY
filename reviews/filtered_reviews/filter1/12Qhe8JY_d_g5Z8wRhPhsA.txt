This is only for the food as I got carded and forgot my ID. Sadly. I so wanted a margarita!

Good points: great location, polite staff, amazingly fast service- we were done in 35 minutes!

Bad points: my fajitas were so bland! Underspiced and underseasoned. I understand it's not possible to please everyone but they could at least ask how you want them done. They actually had no spice. My date didn't enjoy his enchiladas, too flabby and underspiced again. I ordered rice but couldn't have it because I was allergic to the butter in it. Now, it's great that they were looking out for me but could they not make a fresh batch?
