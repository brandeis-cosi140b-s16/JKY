Dropped by for happy hour at this iconic mexican food space in Old Town. extremely disappointed. HH is only in the bar. The bar only had seats AT the bar - the remainder of the bar was dark - no lights turned on. We asked if we could go into the bar area for HH and were told, no, there is no room. We took our money and our appetites to Cien Agave  down the street. will probably not return to Los Olivos....
