"You ever see an Eskimo pee?"
......that was the question being asked by the chef to his coworkers when he should have been checking the temperature, texture, and overall edibility of his kitchen's food.
This place needs some SERIOUS ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY. We ordered chips & salsa....one dish of salsa was cold, the other was room temperature. Neither were great. Our plates arrived and I immediately sent the "shredded beef" taco back and asked them to take it off the bill. The meat was grey and cool. As for my chicken salad, the meat was unseasoned and the chop was too big for the cucumber & tomato. There was no dressing. My son ordered pork enchiladas with the beans on a side plate.......no side plate, beans touching his enchiladas. He said he'd deal with it but watching him try to enjoy the almost inedible "pork" (still unsure if it was chicken instead) was a struggle in itself. My first Corona had been the only joy in the lunch, so I ordered another. Mistake. The second beer had a lime in it that tasted metallic/off/not fresh! 

Will NOT be returning to Salty Se√±orita. QC is sadly missing from this scene.
