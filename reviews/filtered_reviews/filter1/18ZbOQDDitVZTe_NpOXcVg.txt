My husband and I came to Vegas for a convention held at the Flamingo and stayed there.  We ate at Carlos and Charlies twice because it was convenient and no long line.  Both times the service was terrible.  The food is mediocre at best.

The first time we had lunch, the dressing on the taco salad was decent, but it took 30 minutes for a taco salad, Carne Asad tacos and a bowl of soup.  They kept leaving the patio door open and we got up to close it multiple times...there was a chilly breeze blowing the whole time.

The second time was breakfast on a Sunday another 30 plus minute wait for 2 breakfast burritos that were very unimpressing.
