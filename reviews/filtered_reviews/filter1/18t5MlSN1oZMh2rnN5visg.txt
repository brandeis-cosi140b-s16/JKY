Pros:
-Mesa location
-Mini-chimis on menu for about $8

Cons:
-20 minute wait for 2 people. (it was a Friday night though)
-Sitting in the bar area, it took awhile to get drinks and menus.
-After we sat, it took 20 minutes for our order to be taken and put into the kitchen.

I won't be coming back here anytime soon.
