Easily one of the worst dining experiences I ever had. The waitress was pleasant but the food was terrible. I am a big guy and this is the first time in memory that I refused to eat ANYTHING on my plate. 

The steak was dry and tough. The rice tasted like store brand like Lipton. Beans gooey. All around mediocre food. 

Avoid this place.
