I had heard nothing but good things about this place so I was more than a little disappointed when we tried it. I had the pork dish which promised to be full of flavor. Far from it, it didn't even have salt. It was extremely bland & boring to say the least. The hubby had the beef tacos which tasted more like pot roast than Mexican food. Maybe the chef at the Phoenix location gets it right. This one surely doesn't. By far the worst food ever. I gave it 1 star because the waiter was great.
