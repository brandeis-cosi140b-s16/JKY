$16.99 for 2 fish tacos, beans and rice? Seriously? Had to ask 3 times over a 15 minute period for an iced tea. Thoroughly disappointed. Didn't even finish the tacos, beans and rice were terrible, service was way below average. Granted,  the waitress had way too many tables to cover by herself,  so I can't fault her. I definitely will not be returning to this establishment. Nacho Daddy? Nacho Customer. Sorry.
