Man oh man. Such disappointment. Went to have a beer and dinner as I have been here many many times before. As we walked in, fencing played on the television. Yes, the one with swords. The match had ended. We politely asked to put the soccer match on the screen as we were the only humans paying any attention in the baron bar. The bartender, Brett, denied our request and made a "compromise" and put the punisher on. Being that this movie sucked, we pleaded to go back to the fencing. But with no luck, we were forced to watch the punisher. Good food though.
