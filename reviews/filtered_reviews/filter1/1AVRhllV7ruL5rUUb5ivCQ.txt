So not only was "Paco" extremely rude but he refused to give us two waters. He apparently gave us one, but refused to give us a second and said we needed to pay for the second. I don't care if there are or are not any dram shop acts in Las Vegas, but you cannot deny water to people you've been serving alcohol to.  Especially when I know for a fact, and I have proof, that they were serving 19 year olds alcohol. Of course "Paco" who was extremely rude tried to deny alcohol and charge for it was completely out of line.  A bartender should NEVER be required to ask for permission to serve water to a customer no matter what the circumstances are.
