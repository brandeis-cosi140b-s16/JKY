Not good at all.  Started with the Queso Fundido which was string cheese with a mass of onions and mushrooms heated into a flat iron pan with a few tortillas.  Hard to even figure out how to eat and the cheese was flavorless.  Waiter suggested the Steak Picado which was a barely legal cut of steak with undercooked rice and black beans.  My wife had the street tacos carnitas and could only get through one.  Guacamole was good, but that was about it.  Should have kept looking for another place to eat.
