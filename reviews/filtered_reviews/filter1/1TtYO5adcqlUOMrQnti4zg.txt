This place did not impress me at all. The food was mediocre at best and expensive, service was horrible, much better food at Taco Bell. 

The waiter was nowhere to be found most of the evening, when he brought the checks they were doubled up in the Folios with no explanation. 

When the waiter returned the checks for credit card signatures he dropped them in a big pile and left. 

We approached the Manager to discuss the service, he was very indignant and made us feel as if they were doing us a favor by allowing us to visit their establishment. 

Definitely would not recommend this restaurant unless you value poor service, high prices and mediocre food. 

I will definitely never eat at this restaurant ever again.
