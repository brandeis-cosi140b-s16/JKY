Overpriced and overrated. Bathroom situation horrible. It takes at least 10 minutes to walk to the restroom if your seated in the front room and then you gotta get real lucky scoring one of one stall bathrooms to actually do what you gotta do. Moving onto the food, there are no lunch specials available, so you must select off the high priced dinner/lunch menu. Whoever is saying that this salsa is good is clearly off their rocker. It is a watery mess with nothing in the salsa. It is more like a bowl of Frank's red Hot Sauce than a true salsa experience. Chips though were tasty and seemed homemade, but doubt it now. Our lunch choices were the Chicken Mole and one of those tortilla shell salads from the 80's. Her dish was quite standard and I heard no complaints, but my mole had some issues. Smartass waiter said this wasn't a hot item and mole typically isn't, but 1/4 of the way through, this gringo started heavy sweating. Then we have the chicken which did not seem like real chicken. Plus the dish was chicken mole enchiladads, but all they did was give me two cheese enchiladas with some nasty chicken on top and then that horrible mole sauce at a price of almost 12 bucks. 
   Frank and Lupe's time has come and gone. How bout remodeling your cramped front room and modernizing your bathroom facilities while your at it. Scottsdale garbage.
