This was a miserable little place.  After hiking up at Red Rock for 4.5 miles I was in no mood to fix dinner.  To our delight we passed this place on the way home.  We used to LOVE eating at OTB back in CO.  But alas, this was no where near what we were used to.  We were seated right away, but the place wasn't busy.  Our waiter seemed to have great potential but that was just an illusion.  I got my food and it was wrong.  Waiter took it back immediately and brought it back out in about 10 min.  So, I sat there eating chips while the rest (5) of my party ate their dinner.  Yay!  Finally my meal is here.  But wait.  What is this?  It's wrong, yet again.  It's just enchiladas...how can you get these wrong...twice?  I didn't feel like messing with it so I ate it...with no enjoyment.  The food was horrible and bland.  This is not what I remembered from CO.  

Well, as we suck down our beverages the waiter HEISTS my brother's empty root beer glass for a refill.  Yes, he took it to refill it and NEVER brought it back until 20 min when something was said.  Then my husband and I wait for water refills which never came until we asked for it.  And my poor niece, wanting a strawberry lemonade...never got it...but we were charged for it.  Of course, the hubby made sure the $1.59 lemonade was removed.

We were all speechless.  Normally, we would've spoken to a manager but it was decided that we will NEVER come back to this place.  So, it wasn't worth the effort.

Overpriced/bland food, lousy waiter, and drink robbers!  No, sir.  You can keep this establishment for yourself.
