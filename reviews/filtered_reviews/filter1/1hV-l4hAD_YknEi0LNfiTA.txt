The food was just okay. Felt like I could've made something more flavorful at home. Just the food alone would've gotten Dos Gringos at least 2 stars.
The service was terrible. I ordered the Chimichanga, which is supposed to come with rice, beans, pico, sour cream and guacamole. I asked for no sour cream, and when I got my food it had no guacamole instead of no sour cream. I told the waiter, to which he replied, "Oh f***, I forgot." He then brought me the guac. Later when I got the check, he had charged me for the guac. I pointed this out and asked if the guac came with the chimi, and he pulled out the menu and read everything the chimi comes with and purposely left out the guacamole. I brought up the menu on my phone and pointed out that it should come with guac, and he said that the chefs were 'changing the menu up' and that it no longer comes with guac. THEN, I pulled out the physical menu and had to show it to a different employee to confirm again that it does come with guac. Only then did my waiter come by and bring me the dollar that he had charged me for it (no apologies, just loosely handed it to me and said  "here you go").
The $1 extra charge was really no big deal until he lied about it. Why would you lie about it not once, but twice? I wouldn't recommend this place.
