Nothing good. I get it is airport food. But avoid it. Poor service. Couldn't hear our guy and the place was empty.  Fries are soggy.  Chicken sandwich must have been pre made.  My grilled chicken was cold. Like refrigerator cold. And the crunchy stuff in the sand which was terrible. It was pitiful.  Avoid at all costs.  Go to Wendy's or jersey mikes.
