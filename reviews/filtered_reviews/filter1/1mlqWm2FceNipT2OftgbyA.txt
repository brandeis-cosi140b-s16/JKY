There is not really very many options of decent Mexican food up here in North Scottsdale.  When Pinata was here at this location, their food was excellent! Of course it changed owners, turned disgusting and shut down.  Sat empty for a while then we see signs that a new Mexican restaurant is moving in...Will the 3rd time be the charm? 

I THINK NOT!

You get 3 little tacos for $10 comes with beans and rice(both inedible)  We had chicken and carnitas tacos, and I got the chicken and beef tacos. We both got hard shell.  Taco bell's hard shell tacos are more satiating!  Are the meats they use pretty tasty? Yes!  But seriously? Their food comes in street sizes. It comes to you in plastic dishes.  It is run like a Baja Fresh fast food joint with restaurant prices. The only difference is that they serve alcohol and they actually take your order at the table.  That is, slowly take your order. The place wasn't busy, but our server had a very short attention span and was cohorting with the table next to us, and ignoring us completely.  
~AND~

YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR CHIPS AND SALSA???? WHATTTTT??????
This is to deter their BAR crowd to sit and eat chips and salsa all night and just drink the happy hour specials and get free chips/salsa? 
AND to top it all off, you have to go up to this baja fresh/rubios looking salsa bar and get your own.  But there are no self service chips here...YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THOSE! WTF
The salsa is just o-kay Chips-meh!

I can't wait 'til this closes down so another mexican place can take over...yet again...and maybe it will surpass this one.
