Two letters WT!  Simply put, there are too many drunk trashy guys who try to start fights here. The management does little to offset that. We know someone who got his car urinated on by a random drunk person and then that drunk person had the nerve to fight and assault him with 4 of his friends. Yeah, we are talking WEST SIDE type of mentality here!  The owners and the establishment don't do enough to screen their clients. If you are an educated professional that dresses well and thinks fighting in bars is a little white trash and high school then this place is not for you.

Bahama Breeze was nothing special but in early 2000, it at least attracted a crowd that was somewhat educated, trendy and held good jobs. Sandbar is full of people who don't have enough money to party in Scottsdale so they come here instead. I live 5 minutes from this place and I will never come here again. I would much rather drive to Scottsdale.

I wish this place had a cover and a drink minimum because I would pay generously to keep the idiots out.
