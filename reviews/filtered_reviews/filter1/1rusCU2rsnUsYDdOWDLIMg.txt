I was excited to try this place after reading all the Yelp reviews, but I was extremely disappointed with this meal. It was just not good food. We had a big group and ordered a bunch of different items from the menu, including the tacos, burritos, appetizer supreme (DO NOT ORDER THIS it's really gross and gave me a stomach ache - basically just low quality beef and a ton of cheese mixed together on a platter...), and a taco salad. Everything was way too salty, smothered in cheese and grease, and nothing seemed fresh. I do not recommend this place! Not even because it's not "authentic" Mexican food; it just doesn't taste good. (Although maybe the food tastes better after a few $2 margaritas?)
