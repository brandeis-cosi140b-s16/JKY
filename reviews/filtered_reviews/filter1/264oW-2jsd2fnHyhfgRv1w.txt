This place doesn't even deserve the one star. I should've known better and saved my friends and I from eating here when I was about to check in on my phone but we were hungry and wanted to eat ASAP. First off, horrible service! My friend specifically asked for something to be not on her food and they messed up the order! When my food came it was freezing cold. I never complain about food being cold but honestly, my food felt as though it was placed in the fridge for an hour so I sent back my food to get reheated. I could tell it was reheated and just sat there before it was served to me again because the tortillas for my tacos were dry and crunchy yet the meat was still cold! I didn't wanna waste anymore time here so I decided to shut up and just eat the horrible quality meat. The chorizo was okay, but the chicken tasted fake to me, yuck. Mind you our food took forever to come out! The manager was kind enough to give us free chips and salsa... guess I'll give the one star to the manager. Other than that, this place needs to seriously work on management and food quality.

Oh yeah, all of our waters were empty for a good 20-35 minutes and nobody came by to refill our drinks so I literally got up and found a pitcher of water and refilled all of our drinks. Customers shouldn't be doing that!!
