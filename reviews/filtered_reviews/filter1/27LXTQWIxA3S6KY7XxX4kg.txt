I had high hopes for Los Dos.  Between the positive reviews, and word of mouth, we dismissed the negative yelp reviews as happenstance.
We shouldn't have.
First, it took forever to get menus, well after we got our drinks.  The 'House' margaritas are horrid - like tequila and Crystal Light!
@ $21.00 a pitcher, WAY too much.
Then, the food.
My companion's chimi was tasteless.  Mine was 'okay', but nothing to write home about.
The salsa was very spicy, as advertised, and if the entrees and drinks had been better I'd probably return for that.  My companion said not on a bet!
The only positive comment my companion had was the beer she subbed for the poor margs was cold!
The waitress/bartender did not charge us for the margarita pitcher,(because of our complaints!) but took forever to return to collect our payment!
I ate half my meal, and my partner left hungry!
All-in-all a negative experience.
