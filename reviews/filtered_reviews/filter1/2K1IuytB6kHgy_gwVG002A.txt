Very, very bad.  Dinner at Border Grill was so incredibly bad.  We chose it as a somewhat affordable option with what would probably a solid menu of known Mexican staples.  The prices seemed high, but we were tired and hungry and didn't want to go far.

I am not a woman of the most discerning taste.  I love a good sloppy enchilada so I'm not a refined foodie.  The food at Border Grill was so bad that I actually considered complaining that I shouldn't even have to pay my bill.  In the end we sucked it up as a loss because we were too tired to deal with a wait staff that had already proven themselves to be less than adequate.
