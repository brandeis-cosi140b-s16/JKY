Well, I was excited. I had a Buy one Get one free coupon from Facebook. So I called my brother and talked to him and his wife, and we decided to drive out there and make a day of it. I drove 40 minutes to my brothers house, picked them up, and drove 25 minutes to Café Rio. We waited about 25 minutes in line, and after we ordered our food the very rude lady behind the counter told us that we had to print our coupons. I find it super interesting that we had to print our coupons, because I went to the café Rio on Saturday in Chandler and they used the one on my phone just fine. The food tasted good, but the service was worse than bad. If a customer has a coupon, it doesn't matter if it's digital or on paper; we are in the 21st-century. I doubt we will be going back because of this experience.
