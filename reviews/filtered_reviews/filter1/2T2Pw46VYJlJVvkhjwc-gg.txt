I wish I could give it 0 starts! I had a reservation there and when I walked in, there were about 20 other people waiting around the hostess stand. I walked up and said my name and what time my reservation was and the hostess said "yeah, he said that I can't seat anyone right now." I explained that I had a reservation, and was told that the other 20 people also had reservations, but "he said I can't seat anyone and I don't know when I will be allowed to seat." Now usually I'm okay with waiting, but the way that she said it irritated me - I have a background in the service industry and the first rule is to not put blame on another person - manager, servers, cooks, anyone! She could have said "unfortunately we aren't seating right now but once I know more I will let you know!"

Anyway, we went to the bar to see if we could at least get a drink while we waited. We're sitting, and sitting, and sitting, and sitting.... No acknowledgement or greeting from the bartenders. The only time we are acknowledged is when he says "chips?" We said no, we'd like some drinks, but he never got back to us. And the bar wasn't even busy!! While waiting there, I see the hostess seat two tables so I go up to her to see if they're seating now. She says, "well they're find with sitting and snacking on chips - are you? Because I don't have a server for you." Wow. How nice. No, we have a movie to catch and don't want to sit around and wait when you can get a server.

Basically, it was one of the worst experiences I've had - no table after we made a reservation, no acknowledgement at the bar, and no servers able to take us. Very impressed... not!
