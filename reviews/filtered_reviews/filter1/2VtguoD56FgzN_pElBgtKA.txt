First, I was born and raised in ABQ NM. I really WANTED to like this place BUT.........

This is not authentic New Mexican food. FYI- I ordered the bean and cheese burrito with half red and half green chile.

CONS:
- Staff is mediocre and not very friendly
- The flour tortillas are not authentic.  It was like plastic and not anything like you would find in a good New Mexican restaurant.
- The green and red chile are not authentic, they look more like the chili "sauces" that you see in AZ rather than the pure "gold" that you find in NM.
- There was no garnish on my meal except for a coupe of scallions
- The beans were SUPER salty
-  The rice was nothing special and tasteless

PROS
-The salsa and chips were ok
- Atmosphere is ok

I will not return and I feel terrible for having to write a negative review.
