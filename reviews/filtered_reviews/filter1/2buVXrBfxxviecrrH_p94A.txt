Showed up at 830...all the salsas on the salsa bar were cleaned up...the guy was very very rude. And he acted like I was bothering  him  on his phone. He had to give me full limes because he already threw away all the limes and wouldn't cut new. The food was cold and packed all to go when some was for there.  Have another living  social deal but  don't even know if I want to use it.
