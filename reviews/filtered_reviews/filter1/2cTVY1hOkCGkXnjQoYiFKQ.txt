This is the second time I have been into this particular location, the first time back 2014. I noticed a nice sign voted best restaurant. Walked in just like the first time, sitting ourselves then waiting 10 minutes to get drinks and some chips. Finally we order and wait another 30 plus minutes for our food and waiting on drinks. The waiter was all over the place as if maybe he was busy but there were plenty of other waiters to help. I have been to the Henderson location and that one is amazing. I will never recommend this site to anyone. This PLACE BLOWS  such a waste of my money...  I am next to another couple where his wife just finished her meal and the waiter JUST brought out her husbands food and the waiter JON SPENT more time behind on his tables. This place is a joke.... A year ago I have them the benefit of the doubt... A year later same result.
