My wife and I dropped in for a bit Monday evening.  Place was not super crowded, but busy.  Service was horrendous.  We sat there unaknowledged (is that even a word) with no one saying hi, offering a water, or anything for like 5 minutes.  That being the case, we took our business elsewhere.  Not very impressed at all.  Head over to Richardsons if you want great service and good mexican food.  We won't be going back unless we get desperate for variety.
