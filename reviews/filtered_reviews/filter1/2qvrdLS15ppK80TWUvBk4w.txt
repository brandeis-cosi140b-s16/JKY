Having been to Poncho's many times over the years, and never being to excited about their food and service, we happened to be out and about, and hungry Saturday 11/1 around 9pm. I remembered Poncho's serves food late, so we stopped in to give it a try. 

The place we packed. Hardly an empty table which seemed like a good sign.
Service took quite a while, but there were several large parties around us, (one who clearly never heard of "inside voices", but rather "screaming voices") so they were busy. A simple "hello, be right with you" would have been nice though, as opposed to being completely ignored.

We loved the screaming child next to us, who the parents ignored and chose to drink many beers instead of correcting his behaviur. When he knocked some holiday decorations off the wall, the parents simply set them on the floor and went back to their beer. ( not the fault of Poncho's, but indicative of the typical clientele.
I asked about beers on tap, and was told "Bud, Bud light, Miller). Seeems like a Mexican restaurant would have some Dos xx's , Tecate or something, but no.
 We asked how the quesadilla was, and were assured it was fantastic, so we had that, and 2 different combo plates.

 Well, the "quesadilla" was simply 2 heated tortillas with greasy runny orange cheese. No sides, no toppings, just orange goo.

Our entrees were no better. The beans were bland and tasteless, and were the burritos.. It was like eating air. 
The beef taco was HORRIBLE. I literally watched oil run out of it as i held it up.
I voiced my concerns, but was just given a shrug by the waitress.

I used the bathroom, which was a wreck, dirty and no paper towels or soap, and headed out their door for the last time.

I have never understood how people can rave about this place, but they can have it. I won't be back.
