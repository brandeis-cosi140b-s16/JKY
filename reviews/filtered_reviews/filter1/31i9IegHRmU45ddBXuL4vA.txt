A nice NEWER Strip restaurant has pre-packaged microwaved Mexican food??...not normally, but Chayo definitely does. Every single dish tried was boring, tasteless and drowned in some sort of sauce or "salsa". I never thought it was possible to screw up mexican food. I had fish tacos that were greasy cheap looking fish sticks in a tortilla.  Their shrimp diablo was an entertaining sight...since when are tiny cocktail shrimp used as an entr√©e??  The cocktails and service were good and I definitely loved the decor. Get a new Chef and the money will flow! Come on...this is Vegas baby!!!
