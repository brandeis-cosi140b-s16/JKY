Tasteless, shapeless generic slop straight off the Sysco truck with a brief stop in a microwave. No Tex and even less Mex.  This is ersatz Mexican food as an aficionado of Wonder bread and Oscar Mayer bologna might envision it.  Complaining about the meager portions would be nonsensical since they spared us further displeasure with the meal.

Service was prompt.  Proximity to a mall apparently responsible for a large quotient of babies and toddlers in tow - not exactly the Friday happy hour scene one might expect.  Large fountain just beyond gates also a draw for more hyperactive children who scaled walls, fences and ratcheted up the noise even more - parents couldn't be bothered.
