We tried this place because of Howard Seftel's (AZ Republic 12/31/14) assertion regarding the Crispy Baja fish taco that this place "nails this beauty". What a disappointment! I couldn't disagree more.
Rubio's on a bad day beats  Mucho Macho hands down for quality and by far for quantity. We also tried Pastor and Brisket tacos. Pastor tasted good. Brisket was not bad but not remarkable. Portion sizes are very small for the price.
