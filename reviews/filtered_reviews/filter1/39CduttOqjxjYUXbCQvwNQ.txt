Wasted an hour of my time  on a beautiful Sunday at Otro. The service was the worst I have had in a very,very long time , repeatedly asked for chips before they arrived and waited 40 minutes for our lunch. Unfortunately  the food was not edible and  we had no silverware .In retrospect they may have been trying to discourage us from eating the awfull meal.I ordered heuvos rancheros and my mouth tastes like charcoal  2 hours later. How do you butcher eggs and beans?The real issue is lack off emphasis on timely service.I can tolerate imperfect food (awfull) if I think the staff cares.
