If it were possible to give 0 stars, I would. 

Our waiter was absolutely condescending the entire time. Every response came with an exaggerated smile. Also, don't tell us you're busy when we ask for service. Screw you Peter. 

We ordered 5 margaritas. No one at the table swallowed their first sip. Pre-mixed, Splenda-soaked, fake-lime, tequila juice is not something I expect from a "Mexican kitchen." 

The queso fundido was horrendous. They threw a block of curdled cheese into a mini cast iron pot. What??? I mean, it tasted like cheese, so it wasn't nasty. But it was not "queso fundido." 

The rest of the food was palpable, but not close to memorable. 

Sean, the manager, poorly handled our concerns. Also, don't stuff your face with cupcakes in your makeshift banquet area. It's not classy. 

Eric, our runner, was amazing. If I had a $100 bill, I'd slip it in his pocket. The only person hustling the entire time. He literally broke out in sweat while everyone else was wading though molasses. Thank you, you're amazing!
