I've been hearing about this restaurant since I moved to Phoenix over 5 years ago.  It has great reviews, the chef is often featured in local magazines, lots of people love it, etc.  I just never made it because my all-time favorite restaurant in town is also on 16th street (La Condesa aka La Santisima). On a number of occasions I've planned to go to Barrio but once I'm on 16th Street I just go to La Santisima because I love that place.  Anyway, today I finally went to Barrio, and will never make this mistake again.  

First, the food was mediocre, at best. I will admit that their guacamole was delicious. But that's about it.  I literally didn't eat my plate.  That's how bad it was.

Second, everything was over-priced.  I have no problem paying higher price for good food, but this just isn't worth it.  For example, that delicious guacamole is $13. The fries that came with the tacos tasted like cheap grocery store frozen pre-cut fries, which is gross.  The corn tortillas that the tacos came in were terrible--mealy and dry, and the salsas (2 kinds) just tasted like vinegar--no complex flavors or spice.

Third, and most upsetting, the service was horrendous.  It was possible one of the worst service experiences I've had in a restaurant in town.  

So I'm glad I tried it, because now I will never wonder about heading here when I'm craving Mexican food, and will definitely never go back to this place.
