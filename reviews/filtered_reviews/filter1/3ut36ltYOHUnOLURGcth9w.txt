Never order Mexican with a slick facade.  Anyplace in a strip mall with Grandma back in the kitchen usually yields the gold.  This place, all hipster glitter and low rider bikes, needs to spend less time with the chrome and more time with the food.  I was underwhelmed by everything on the menu, even the guava Margarita.  Will not be going back.
