The look and atmosphere of this place is starting to show its age. We just ate there for dinner, and the food was mediocre at best, stale tasting chips. 

After we finished with our so so meal, our waitress was no where to be found. We learned she was attending a large group and she just abandoned us. It felt satisfying leaving no tip.

Adios Macayo, we'll NEVER return.
