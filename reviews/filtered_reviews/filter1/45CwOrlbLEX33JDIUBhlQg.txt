I have been to Wahoos twice, first time it was during lunch ..food and service was OK.  A few weeks ago ( Thursday night) we returned after midnight to go have a drink with friends since we live close by. The place was empty maybe about 5 people scattered around the bar. We came into the bar area just my wife and I to wait for our friends... The bartender at the moment was talking to one of her customers so we sat patiently to wait for her to get to us.. ( by this time she had seen us and turn back to talk to her customer friend and not even acknowledge that we were there, not even the smallest gesture she could ever made to make sure we knew that  she knew that we were waiting)... but still sat patiently and waited .. now I work in the industry and after 3 minutes of waiting and hearing their loud conversation from across the bar I think that will piss off any customer since you don't even have the smallest delicacy to go and say " Hi , how are you guys doing? Ill be right back " that would have sufficed instead of ignoring us and keep your ladies night talk which every other customer ( 5 people maybe) are  hearing  you , my wife said lets just get up and go just to prove a point so we did!... I was reading the reviews about this place and I don't ever yelp but maybe they do have a bit of a problem with customer service and i would just like the owners to be aware of it .
