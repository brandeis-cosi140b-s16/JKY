I really wanted to like this place.  I always pass by it on my way to and from work....heard a lot of good things about it.  I saw a lot of great looking things on the menu.  As soon as we sat down, on came the disappointments.  The waiter/bartender was lazy as heck.  The only time that he came to check on us was when we complained to the manager about the horrible food and service we were experiencing.  I ordered Tamales, Burrito and Chicken taco....It took forever for the food to arrive (over 30 minutes, which the manager/staff got an earfull about) and then when the food arrived, they forgot to bring the taco!  And then when they finally brought the taco, it was ice cold.  The entire experience was a complete let down.  When we went to complain and ask for the manager, it was as if the manager didn't even want to cop to being the manager...as if he was afraid of us.  Sheesh...Lots of great reviews I'm seeing on Yelp from this place so maybe the staff thought that my wife and I just deserved "Special Treatment?"  If you go to this place, just beware that maybe you'll be the next one to be singled out.  LOL...  Guess I'll jsut stick to Patron's
