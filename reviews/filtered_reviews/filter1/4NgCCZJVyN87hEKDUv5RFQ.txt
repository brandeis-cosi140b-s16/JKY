I was told this place has excellent Mexican food, but they were mistaken. To start my experience, my fianc√© ordered a coke and received a Pepsi. The server never mentioned they only had Pepsi products. Oh and my other friend ordered a water and received a Pepsi. They brought us some sort of soup before the meal which tasted a lot like a can of microwave noodle soup. Not impressed. When I got my beef enchilada the meat was actually cooked wonderfully, however, it was accompanied by the most horrendous beans I've ever tasted. I was just not impressed with this place at all.
