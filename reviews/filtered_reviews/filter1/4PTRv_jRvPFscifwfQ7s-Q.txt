Oh. My. God. Friends had been telling me that we should try Macayo's. They said it was good Mexican food. I finally tried it. I ordered the Sonoran Enchilada Sampler and I'm not kidding, the sauce tasted like the crap they used to give us at elementary school and call enchiladas. That is EXACTLY what it reminded me of. Blech. I didn't like it then and I don't like it now. How have they been in business for so long?
