Growing up, this was a restaurant that our family avoided. Now we're older and our tastes have changed. Macayo hasn't. It's bland, boring Mexican food with watery, flavorless salsa that my now elderly parents can't get enough of and I go along for the ride.

If you have snowbirds to entertain, this will surely do the trick. Nobody will get something too spicy. Otherwise, there are better choices in town. But if you enjoy the culinary time warp and your stomach can handle heavy, bland Mex, have a seat, as these recipes haven't changed since 1948.
