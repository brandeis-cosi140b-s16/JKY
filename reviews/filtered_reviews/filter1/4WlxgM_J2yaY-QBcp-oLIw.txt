I placed a pick up order online two hours before my pick up time of 12:30. The food didn't even come out for another 25 minutes. They served people that walked in after I did, that placed the order in person. What's the point of ordering online for a specific time and then having to wait another 25 minutes? Horrible service and will not be returning.
