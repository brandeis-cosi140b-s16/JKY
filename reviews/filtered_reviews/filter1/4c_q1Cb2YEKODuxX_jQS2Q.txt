My parents were in town and I foolishly made a reservation here. I feel like an idiot for not reading between the lines of all the fake yelp reviews first! I usually try to filter potential fakes, but I was searching for a good place and I had to find this place. I figured that a place with a great  city view would be a good idea so my parents could enjoy it, and the online menu looked decent enough and they had a few items for me. 
It looked nice when we walked up to the place, dark and very loud after we walked inside. This place is perfect if you are looking for a "Mexican Chuck E. Cheese" with inflated prices, and I am sure the owner is laughing every day at the stupidity of people like me for dining there. I live here in Vegas, so I had no excuse. I just hope my parents can forgive me for taking her there!
