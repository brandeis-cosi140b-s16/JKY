I wish I could give this restaurant more stars because I have always liked Cafe Rio, but the service has gone down hill. I placed my order before hand, told the young lady over the phone that I wanted red sauce and a chili relleno with no meat, 4 times! I also stated I wanted a side of the medium sante fe green chili sauce. Well guess what, it was wrong. When we got to the restaurant, she stated that the chili rellenos only came one way and she stated, "I was going to call you but I didn't" so we then ordered cheese enchiladas instead of the chili rellenos with RED sauce. Mind you again, I ordered red and said cheese multiple times. We get home open up the containers, the enchiladas were not red sauce, they were green, again I ordered them with red sauce. The sauce I ordered in the side was supposed to be sante fe medium sauce, it was tomatillo. Called in, the managers response was oh she's not familiar with the sauces. Not familiar with the sauces? She works at Cafe Rio! I then go to eat the enchiladas and they have chicken in them. If they only serve items with meat, they need to tell customers. I called back again, the manager still acted like it was no big deal and didn't care. Customer service means a lot to me and the fact that you can't take care of customers, is total incompetence!
