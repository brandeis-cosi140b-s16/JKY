Epic fail in food. I built a burrito with shrimp, guac, pico, cheese, and cabbage (they forgot the cabbage); and a side of refried beans (they gave me black beans unfried). We got a large side of guac (they said 2 smalls would be better, but they only gave us one). A side of queso (containing a nickel sized burnt piece). Amanda got a shrimp taco salad (mostly beans and rice. Rice?) which had a very large avocado pit in it. The 2 bottled beers were quite good though.
Only $32. Wait...what?
