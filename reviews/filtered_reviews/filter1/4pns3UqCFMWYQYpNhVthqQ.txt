By all means don't go here! Their prices are misleading! They don't have a menu with pictures to know what you mr paying for. I got 3 small ass tacos and a drink " they called a special" for $7.79! And a credit card fee of .50$ so, with a small ass taco and small size drink all came to $8.92! Should went to del taco and get a fiesta pack for less and more food!

Oh! Also, they should add rice and beans to the order for the price your getting for. Overall! Telling all friends and family not to attend any your restaurant. Roberts is better!!
