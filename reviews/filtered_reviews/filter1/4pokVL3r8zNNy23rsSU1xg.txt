Lame place.  I was staying at the Monte Carlo, the hotel it's connected to, and so my friend was inside.  I was going over to just make sure she was OK since it was 1:45 am and Vegas tends to get a lot of drunk, horny guys around that time and I just wanted to just have a drink with her.  I had had drinks here before so it was no big deal but the door man at their inside entrance told me I had to go to the front entrance which was outside.  No big deal so I went around.  The bouncer outside said they were closed and wouldn't even allow me in to look for my friend.  I even asked if he would hold onto my Drivers license but the douche bag wanted my phone instead.  Since there was no way I was going to give him my Galaxy S3 to hold onto he said "then you ain't gettin' in so leave".  Rude attitude of a NY city club but at some dive bar in Vegas.  
  Like I stated before I had been there prior to this, the service was poor, the establishment smelled like mold, and it was like the bar in the movie "From Dusk till Dawn".    
  I honestly will never go back based on the way they treat people who are staying at the hotel their establishment is connected to and seeing that you can easily take a tram to go to the Aria or Bellagio there are far better options.
  NEVER GOING BACK HERE.
