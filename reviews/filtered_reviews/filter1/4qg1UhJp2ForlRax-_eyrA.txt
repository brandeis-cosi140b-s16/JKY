Did the right thing and checked Yelp before choosing.  No seating at first choice, so took a chance on the lesser option here.  What a mistake. Sub par service and sub par food.  Chips and salsa - chips were thick fried so hard i ripped my mouth up on them. Salsa was good, but salsa is very hard to screw up. $9. Ordered the spicy seasoned chicken sandwich. Bread wasn't fresh and required some shearing strength to complete the only bite i took.  Went looking for salvageable contents - chicken breast was thin sliced in half, no flavor. Bunch of onions that i carefully read the ingredients to avoid. Steak fries were cold. Spicy ketchup was the best thing on the plate.

I'm writing this review from next door at La Grande Orange where I'm enjoying the well reviewed Kale salad... Should have listened to my fellow Yelpers and saved $33 wasted next door.
