My Wife and I decided to try out this place of a so call street taco.  The name Joyride says it!  they will take you for a joy ride on there so call tacos.  Im not going to pay 4 dollars for a taco with no sides.  The drinks are horrible.  Salsa is mushed up with who knows what.  Everything on the menu is so discrimintive.  Why GRINGO?  or is this place is only for whites.  I wouldnt eat here ever.  If you want good street tacos, go to a real mexican resturant, at least youll get sides with it and real food.  If there were a choice on the star, I would not even give one.  Horrible.  never eat at joy ride again.
