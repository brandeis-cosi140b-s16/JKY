Service is awesome, atmosphere is nice ,but the food is not. always thought restaurants in hotels like this food should be great but not here. We had Dancing eggplant don't know why for some reason its so freaking salty i do hope who even prepare this knows how salty this eggplant is i know they said it has soy sauce but i didn't know they will just pour soy sauce in it. We also had Gan pung ji chicken its as salty as the eggplant. The only thing i did like is their chips and salsa tasted fresh. Their vegetable fried rice like they said its good give it a 2 stars. sorry but i will never suggest wasting your money here.
