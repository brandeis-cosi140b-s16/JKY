Food is ok but not such a good value for the price.  Drinks are expensive.  Service is awful.  Slow, got the orders mixed up, the bills were mixed up,  the server was unprofessional (rude, calling women "darlin" - how tacky).  Watch out when they add 18% service on a big party - on our bill it said 18% but the math came out to more like 30%.  The decor is just awful.  There are lots better places to eat.
