Worst torta I ever had. Very small amount of meat and mostly all bread. Dry and bland. Way over priced for a  awful torta. Being from LA, where there are Mexican restaurants everywhere, I know true Mexican food when I see it. This place gets 2 thumbs down.

After posting this review, I scrolled down to read other reviews and noticed someone saying the SAME THING. No meat all bread.! Sorry to hear I'm not the only one.
