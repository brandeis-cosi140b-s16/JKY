The tamales sucked! Frozen tamales are better. The skirt steak was undercooked and made the partner sick. 
It was a good reminder as to why we should all avoid restaurant chains. At least I should. I'd rather have tacos and carne fries from any of the ----berto's than go back.
Alcohol couldn't even make it better.
