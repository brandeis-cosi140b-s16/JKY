I'm not one to be rude but my daughter and I had no service at all. We went there yesterday hoping to have a good dinner together but did not turn out that way. We ordered 1 drink each when we were seated. We ordered our food from the waitress ....and we never saw anyone again. Our food was great and spicy but we had finished our drink and we had to suck it up. Super disappointed. We asked a random waitress walking by for our check. That sucked.
