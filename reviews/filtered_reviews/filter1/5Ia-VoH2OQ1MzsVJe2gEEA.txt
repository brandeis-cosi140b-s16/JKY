Let me start by saying that the food was not the problem.  The food was good, not great, but good enough to eat again. My problem was with the service.  My family went there with a table of 12, which was reserved in advance so they knew we were coming.  We were seated and did not even see our waitress for 15 minutes, then we ordered our drink and didn't get them for another 20 minutes or so.  Our appetizers did not take too long to arrive, however the entrees are another story.  8 of the 12 people received their entrees after about 45 minutes (at this point we had been there for almost 2 hours) and 4 of my family members did not receive their entrees at all.  After the 8 people who had received their entrees had finished their food, the other 4 entrees were still not at the table.  Also, in the 2+ hours we were there, we saw the waitress 3 times.  We had 8 people with empty drinks for the last 40 minutes we were there. There were 3 tables of 2 people around us that arrived way after us and left way before us. Next time I want Mexican food, it may just be faster to drive to Mexico and back.  I would not recommend going here unless you have a small party because they obviously do not handle large parties very well.
