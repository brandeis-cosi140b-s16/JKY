WORST MEXICAN FOOD I'VE HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!! You couldn't pay me to go back there. The enchiladas were watery and disgusting and my taco was soggy and inedible. Only thing I could even eat was the beans and rice and even those were bland and unsatisfying. I would give this place less than one star if I was allowed.
