Never had a problem when my mom and I would go here. We decided to order online since we had a few things to do. We ordered 2 enchiladas and queso. My mom gets there and there's no queso. The lady says they'll make it and it'll be 10 minutes. Okay... 10 minutes pass, they hand her our order and there's only one enchilada. So then she had to wait for them to make the enchilada. I don't understand the point of online ordering if you get there to pickup your order and it takes longer to get your meal than just waiting in line and ordering there. Waste of time and the food did not taste good.
