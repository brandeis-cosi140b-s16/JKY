Horrible!! The food was gross, and after bringing me the wrong item twice the server didn't even offer to take my meal off the tab. We were the only table in there and the server messed up everyone else's order too. When it was time to pay he got every bodies tab wrong, he handed me my tab at 8:00 and then grabbed it out of my hand. By the time I payed it was 8:30 and I'm sure it was the wrong amount but by that time I just wanted to leave. Also they brought the birthday girl her cake after most if the party left.
