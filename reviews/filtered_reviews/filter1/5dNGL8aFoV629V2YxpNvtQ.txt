From the outside this place looks and speaks to you "Vegas"....... however......

...I arrived at the venue, starving and ready to eat, got in and was quickly seated with my brother. 2 beers ordered straight away, usual drill.......

I had commented on the way in, that some guy I was stood next to STANK, it was after we had fully submerged ourselves in the restaurant that the smell was not going away.

The drinks arrived and I asked the waitress what the smell was, and she told me they had been'having trouble with the sewage' for a while and that 'you get used to it' The smell was so rotten I am surprised they were able to stay open....We told her no way! As if I am going to eat with all these particles of other peoples sewage getting inhaled with every bite of my burrito. I am not getting used to it!

The bar became an ongoing joke every time we are in Vegas and we nicknamed it 'Feces' 

I tried it again a year later and it still wreaked. 

The happy ending is that I was just in Vegas and they were charging $65 to watch the Pacman fight in there, so I went across the road and watched it for free from the Hard Rock!

Sorry I cant give any more of a review of the place, couldn't get past the smell
