So to start off, the staff and service here was good.

The idea of this place seemed like a good idea but as my group looked over the menu, none of the food was what we were expecting.  I understand the concept of this place being that you all order small dishes to share within the group.  The waitress explained that normally you need about 2-3 dishes per person to fill you up. Keep in mind each of these small dishes are about 5-25 dollars.  With a large party, this place is not worth it for you.

Our waiting asked if we would like to have some chips and salsa for the table. We said sure so they brought out two sets since we had 7 people. Then she goes, I can bring out some guacamole if you guys would like as well. We said, sure. So they brought out two bowls

I was really craving tacos but noticed it was 5.50-10.50 for one. I asked her how big the tacos were and she said 2-3 bites worth. Sorry, I don't care how good this taco was... It's not worth that price. I can get a better tasting taco in east la from a taco truck. 

Their "famous" fried rice didn't wow me either. Tasted like something I could get at any regular Chinese place. 

When we got out check with a grand total of 171 dollars we were pretty confused since we only order a taco each and some fried rice. We then noticed we were charged 12 dollars for chips and salsa and then 15 dollars for each bowl of guacamole. Pretty shocked at this point. Cool. 

Got home and looked at my bank account to find that 15 extra dollars was charged on my debit card from them. So overall, I'd never come to this place again.
