Really disappointed! We went to eat on a Wednesday  about 3pm, the place was practically  empty & it took 15 minutes just to get our menues. The waitress was very rude & unfriendly.  After we ordered it took about 30-40 minutes for our food & the place was empty! Food was below average, my kids & I didn't like it, needless to say we won't be going back.
