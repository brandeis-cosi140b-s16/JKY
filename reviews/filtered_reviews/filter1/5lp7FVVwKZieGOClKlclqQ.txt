My husband and I heard great reviews about this restaurant and we decided to give them a shot. One word can describe this place GROSS!!! The food sounded great but then you took a bite and ewww disappointment. The salsa was lame, the chips stale. There were only two good things about this place the soda and the waitress was nice. Other than that don't waste your money GO TO ABUELO'S...it may be on the west side but it never disappoints.
