I must be asking for Cafe Rio punishment . I've been to Cafe Rio's in Utah before they hit vegas. I thought the experience would be the same. I'm sure we all expect consistency between locations. I was excited that a location was opening minutes from home, and during the 1st open year of this location that consistency was there. Then it went to hell.  The horrible, horrible customer service skills. Rude to customers, if you go in for dinner, expect them to be out of important ingredients to their menu. 
This last visit we ordered 2 orders of coconut tacos. They were apparently out of the mango salsa. But they don't say anything or offer a substitute. They instead assume I want Ranch with my tacos. What? Then my daughter wants a small bowl of sides including grilled chicken. They tell us they are out as well because they're not going to make anymore today. It's 6:30 in the evening. Not closing time. I over hear another disgruntled customer at the register complaining about a long wait to the girl who claims to be the manager and you can see her body language is not caring.
But this wasn't the 1st time I experienced this. The last time I was here (more than a year before. I had sworn I wouldn't come back), I experienced a very similar situation. And I actually wrote a formal complaint to their corporate offices through their website, not expecting anything free. But I definitely had hoped for a call back with an apology, but instead got nothing. Huge disappointment in this companies practices.
What I also noticed since my last visit was the HUGE reduction in customers at the line for food. Considering the horrible levels of service, my guess is others have also decided to no longer eat here and thus sales have fallen. I could be wrong. Probably not. The customer EXPECTS great service from a food establishment.
