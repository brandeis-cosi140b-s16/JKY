I usually love Cafe Rio and went to this location all the time. I ordered chips and queso and a burrito with medium sauce and a steak quesadilla. Well first off i don't write reviews on Yelp unless it is terrible or outstanding. This is my second review and let me start off by saying the customer service was TERRIBLE. I stood at the register to pick up my to go order for about 5-10 minutes, meanwhile THREE employees looked at me and then clocked out for break at the same register I was waiting at and didn't even acknowledge me. Then when someone finally rang me up I paid and then waited for my food some more when it should have been ready when I got there. As I'm waiting  for awhile, after I paid, an employee comes up to tell me they're out of medium sauce and I said okay I'll take the mild I guess. Then once they tell me my order is ready I grab it and look in the bag and realize my chips and queso aren't in there. I have to get an employees attention again and they tell me oh I'm sorry we're out of queso. They failed to tell me that before I paid or even when I went to grab my order. Needless to say, I won't be back because it was that bad..
