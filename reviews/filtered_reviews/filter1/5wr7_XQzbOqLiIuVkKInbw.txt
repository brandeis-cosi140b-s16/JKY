What a disappointment.  Went to this restaurant following a review on AZ Check Please.  The food was too hot and lacked flavor.  The waitress referred to it as spicy, however there is a great difference between spicy and just plain too hot.  Service was poor.  There was no follow up regarding our meal and after waiting an interminable length of time for my check, I finally had to go to the bar and request my check.  This is a restaurant I will not return to and one that I will not suggest to friends.
