Terrible! This "restaurant" is in a great location, right in our neighborhood. This may be a convenient place to get your meal, but you will regret it. The food was not edible. This was probably the owners first restaurant, after looking at the poorly written menu. They didn't even have guacamole on the menu. If i am right and this was her first restaurant, why would she begin by creating a mexican restaurant? You know it is not going to be authentic. We ordered some disgusting  chicken tacos with a weird spicy barbeque-like sauce and we also ordered some empenadas. These empenadas tasted like the frozen ones which you defrost, which she probably did happen! Overall, the only good part of the meal was the chips (not the salsa), and the chips were just like Tostitos.
Another really unprofessional  way of beginning a new business is leaving the restaurant! As we were leaving to go to our car, the owner walked to the nearby boutique to go shopping. I do not think it is OK for the owner to leave the restaurant to do some shopping.
I think if you live in that part of town like I di, you are better off eating at a GOOD restaurant after the 101. The Summit tried, but failed.
