Since Las Velas is one of the hot spots for night life in Pittsburgh, it also deserves a review! We have been constant customers for Las Velas night life and have been pretty disappointed by the service during saturday night latino dancing! Starting off with the basic sitting room, there are only about 10 tables available for sitting down to have a drink. To use a table you have to pirchase a bucket of beers that usually will cost you less if you go to the bar. There is a waitress that will attend to you at the tables but god knows when she will be back to bring you refills.  A bucket can vary in cost 60 to 70 dollars per bucket and is only beneficial if u have more than 2 people drinking. If you stop drinking buckets of beer, the waitress will ask you to move once you decide not to continue with another bucket even if you still have alcohol to drink from your bucket that you had purchased. The small sala de baile that when dancing you feel as if you are in a bumper car hitting up against a maximum of 20 couples who are able to dance at a time. The rules in regards to tables, alcohol etc continuosly change so although this review may provide an estimate of current pricing that is not to say that without warning the restaurant management will decide to change costs at will.
