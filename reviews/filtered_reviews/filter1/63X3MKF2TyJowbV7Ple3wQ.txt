I just had the absolute worst experience ever at a restaurant at this location. The bad part was the food. The worst part was the service. Some how my wallet had fallen out of my purse, so I went to my car to get it. I had already asked my server for the bill because I was in a hurry and she took forever to come back to my table. As I was walking back in to pay and finish my food she was walking out and even though she is watching me walk back in with my wallet in hand she says very loudly,"you didn't pay your bill." I told her I went out to get my wallet from the car and I was returning to finish my food and pay. I told her she wAs rude and disrespectful. Her only reply was that they have problems with people leaving without paying. They have lost a customer for life and I will never recommend this restaurant over a bill of $11.12. Good job!
