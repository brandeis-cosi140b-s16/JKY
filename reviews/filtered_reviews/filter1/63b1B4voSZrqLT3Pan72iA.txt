I'm not sure what to say. I have never seen a tortilla with no grill marks. The food is very expensive and not very good. In fact our cochjnita pibil was mostly fat. The beans were very sweet and no salsa in sight. Still cost almost $50. For two people. It's cheaper to buy churros at Disney land. Won't be back for sure. Don't waste your money. Lost of better places to eat on this strip.
