Recently moved to Az and was born and raised in So. Cal. On a quest to find "real" Mexican food in my new state, and have sadly been disappointed yet again.  I will start with the cons..... Chips were a great portion and they even brought out 2 salsa bowls without us having to ask.  However, the chips had massive amounts of some sort of kosher salt. When we asked for different chips the waitress told us that's all they had but she gave us chips from the "top" and hopefully that would be better. It was not :( We ordered nachos $10 (no meat), fish tacos w/ soup $12, and a quesadilla $7.  What a disappointment when the food came.  The $7 quesadilla was tiny, I mean miniature. Where I come from a $7 quesadilla will get you an extra large tortilla grilled not microwaved with a side of rice and beans.  This place NO!!! Just the quesadilla on a small plate w/a tiny lil side salad.  The fish tacos tasted like they got them straight from that large body of water inTempe. No rice and beans just 2 tacos, and a tiny bowl of what appeared to be mole "soup" YUCK" all for a whopping $12!!!!!!  The nachos were mediocre tasteless black beans and minimal cheese. No meat and just tons of the same damn salty chips.  
Pros - service was good,the waitress was kind and gracious when we told her the food sucked.  We left after 2 bites and the manager comped the entire meal.  

I can't imagine how this place has 4 stars but it appeared that everyone was happy and the place was packed.  My expectations are obviously A LOT higher then even I thought.   Try them if you dare...... Drink plenty of alcohol, their bar looked pretty cool. Maybe that will help wash down the mess they call "Mexican" food.
