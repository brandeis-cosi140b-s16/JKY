Went here for lunch with a co-worker.  They brought us out a typical small guacamole and cold chips before we ordered.  

We ordered our food- chicken quesadilla and carne asada tacos.  The beans were cold, but the food was good otherwise.  

We had a nice time, and when the bill came were in a rush to get back to work.  We noticed the bill was significantly higher than expected.  When we asked our waitress why, we discovered THE SUPPOSED COMPLIMENTARY (WE HAD NOT ASKED FOR THEM) SMALL CHIPS AND GUACAMOLE WERE $10.95!!

We did not have time to address the management, which I would normally do in this case.  The waitress did not apologize, and confirmed there was not a sign or note that informed us the chips and guacamole were mandatory and not complimentary.
