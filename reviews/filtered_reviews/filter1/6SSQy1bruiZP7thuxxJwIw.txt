I can say that I will not drive from North Scottsdale down to barrio cafe anymore 

The service was absolutely deplorable ,I had to ask for water 4 times 

The chiles en Nogada was not prepared correctly 

The meat was not chopped up,  it was big chunks of meat 

It was absolutely not worth the drive or the money they charge.

They better get their act together or they're going to be out of business.

Too bad,  she is living off for past reputation
