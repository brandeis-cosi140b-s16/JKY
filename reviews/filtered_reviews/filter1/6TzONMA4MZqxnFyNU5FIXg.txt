I will not go back, my food has been wrong twice. Way over priced. They have good tacos and guacamole dip, but 10$ for one guacamole and some seasoning,it's fancy that they make it in front of you but not worth it. Last time we were there we ordered a drink that was disgusting and tasted like aftershave. As long as you stick to there sangria and tacos you will probably like it.
