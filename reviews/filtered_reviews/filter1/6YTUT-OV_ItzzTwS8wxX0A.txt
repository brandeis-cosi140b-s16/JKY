I have been to Javier's in Newport Beach - Excellent - I have been to Javier's in Irvine - Excellent  - but the Javier's in  Las Vegas at the Aria hotel - I give it a one star and a 0 rating - the quality of the food is nothing near the quality of the other locations.  The service is a 3 on a scale of 1-10 and even though the menu may be the same, the quality and portions are not.  Its not authentic tasting like the other locations - its a glorified Taco Bell.  I would not return to the Javier's in Las Vegas.  I think they definitely treat people like tourists and don't care of the quality or service.
