Bad service, bad food. Can't seem to get anything right. First I couldn't get anyones attention, and im sitting at the bar. It was hard to get a drink, even harder to get a menu. My side of guacamole for the chips never came my food.order was wrong and when I explained that, they looked at me as if I am crazy!! bottom line this place sucks.
