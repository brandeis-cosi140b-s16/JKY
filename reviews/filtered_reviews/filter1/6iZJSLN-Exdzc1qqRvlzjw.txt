Save your money and save your stomache.

My father, husband and I went here in January.   It was an insulting experience.

1. The lighting was so low that my father had to request a flashlight to read the menu. The waiter actually REFUSED and said the owner liked it dark.  Then about 30 minutes later he came back with one (after I read the menu for my dad and we had ordered).  Who tells a 70 year old man "no you can't have a flashlight to read the menu because the owner likes it dark in here?"

2. My husband recieved the wrong order and tried to eat it thinking that all mexican food is good.  It wasn't so he didn't even eat a quarter of it.

3. My meal, the shrimps, were charred on the outside and raw on the inside.   I had two shrimp and of course couldn't eat anymore.  I actually got sick at home.

I asked to speak with the manager and he or she never came.    I paid my bill because I didn't want to be accused of dine and dash.   

I went to the hostess and asked to speak with the manager.  The place was too busy, again, the manager never came.

So I went home

That night I went to their facebook and wrote them a message asking for a response or I would go to my bank for a claim.   They never got back to me.

I filed a claim with my bank and of course it was denied.   Lindo Michoacan LIED to my bank and said we completed our meals and that we NEVER asked for a manager.   They pointed out I left a tip.   Of course I left a tip, I am not going to punish the waiter for the Chefs poor cooking or the Managers refusal to deal with a customer complaint.  I am also not going to leave a bill unsettled and be acuse of a crime.   Lindo Michoacan LIED about me not writing them a message on their facebook.  

This establishment has bad food, poor service and unethical management - this type of establishment is bad for our community and for our recovering economy.  Who wants to have a lying crapy restaruant in their town?
