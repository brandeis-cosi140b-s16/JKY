This used to be one of my once-a-month spots, but not anymore. Normally I get the Chimichanga, which comes with a side of guac and sour cream for somewhere around $11. Today I tried the burro, a la carte (no rice or beans). I missed the side of guac and sour cream, so I ordered it. The burro was $8.95. The side of guac and sour cream was $6.50. How does that make any sense at all? No, the server didn't inform me of the added cost when I ordered it. On top of that, the service was absolutely horrible. I had to flag someone down to order. There were only 2 other individuals in the place, and they were at the bar.  So when I got my bill for $21, needless to say, I was furious. I frankly am ashamed of myself for paying that and leaving a tip on top of it.  I informed the bartender (because my waitress was nowhere to be found) that I would not come back. He didn't seem to care.  I am certain this location will not be in business for long if this is the way they continue to operate. What a shame.
