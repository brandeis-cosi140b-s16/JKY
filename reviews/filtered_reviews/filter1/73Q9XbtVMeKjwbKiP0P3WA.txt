Terrible service every time I have visited this place. The waitress seriously forgets about you and hides in the back or something!?!?!? And the other posts are right, the waitresses look like 18 year old...hungover strippers...who hires these people? I got a quesadilla and who can mess that up? It tasted like they put cheese on a tortilla and microwaved it for a minute! OMG!! Drinks are terrible. I feel dirty when I come here. Don't do it!
