It was packed, Friday night. Service was good, but the food, to put it nicely, SUCKED.

Chicken fajita for two was filled with chicken pieces that looked like they were scraped from a slaughter room floor. The seasoning made the chicken orange, and several pieces were nothing but connective tissue. Onions were not on the serving plate -- well there was one small piece of onion. 

Flan for desert, was an insult to flan everywhere and was soaked in something like pancake syrup.

 All in all, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE. Never again!
