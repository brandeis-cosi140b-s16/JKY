This place is awful!! Do NOT go!!! My friend and I went on a Sunday night. The location is perfect. The decorations are beautiful. It has great potential. We sat on the patio and our server came over right away. That's were it started going downhill. We didn't order cocktails but did order an appetizer. Our server ignored us for the rest of the night and we had to literally ask him if we could order our entrees. The tacos we got were so dry and we didn't want to even eat them except that it took so long to get them that we were starving! Afterwards, we asked for the manager and he did give us a discount and made the server apologize, but it came off so fake and he didn't even bother to make up a fake excuse for his attitude... I would not come back here ever, nor would I recommend it to anyone, local or visiting!
