This was the most embarrassing, disgusting night I've had at a restaurant.

First off all, the waiter was too busy making fun of my drink order (smaller size) to get it right, even after coming back to double check what I'd ordered.  The food itself was barely decent enough to eat since we were there and had paid for it, but I (and everyone else in my party) declined take home boxes for the leftovers.

Worst of all, we got about halfway through our chips before we discovered a USED sugar packet in the bottom of the bowl.  Apparently, they took a bowl from a previous table, refilled it, and passed it on to us without emptying it or cleaning it.  When we pointed it out to the waiter, we got nothing by a fresh bowl of chips and a surprised look.  NO apology, no words at all, from the waiter.  This was back in March (2008), and I reported it to the business the next day.  They, too, offered no apology.  In fact, the only apology I ever received for this potential health violation was from the friend who recommended that I go to this place.

Avoid it like the plague.  There are better places for Mexican food, no matter how Americanized you like it.

Update:  I mentioned my horror story to an acquaintance who had just gone to Macayo's.  He found it interesting, since he noticed the waiters now mash the chips as they pick them up from a table.  We wonder if they do this to make it clear which bowls have used chips, and which are fresh.  He said the food was still "meh."

Over a year later, and I still never received an apology.  You'd think they'd take a health violation more seriously than that.
