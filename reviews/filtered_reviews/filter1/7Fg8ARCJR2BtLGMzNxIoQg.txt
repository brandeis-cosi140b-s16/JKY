Terrible experience. We ordered the salsa flight which was good. Then ordered the tacos and a burrito. The pork was pink and undercooked. When we sent the plates to the kitchen so they could see it the owner/chef came out aggressive and confrontational. In all my years of waitressing, bar tending and being a restaurant manager (and having to deal with these issues) I have never attacked a table in the manner he did. We will never be back.
