Blah-tastic,.  You know it's restaurant like this that stay open for decades and no that is not a good thing.  I got the shrimp tacos, can some one please tell me how can you F#%K up a shrimp taco? There were 2 shrimp inside of each taco and the were breaded and fried!!! In my universe shrimp tacos should always be made with grilled shrimp and especially if 2 tacos cost $8.00!!! 
It makes no difference to me if the Mexican food I am eating is authentic or not.  I love TexMex food but what I don't love is old freezer burned fried shrimp in my tacos. What a disgrace.
