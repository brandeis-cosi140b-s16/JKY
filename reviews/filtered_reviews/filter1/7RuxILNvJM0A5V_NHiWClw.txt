Would not recommend going to this place for a meal. 

The breakfast is disgusting and the servers are rude. My mom said her biscuits and gravy was inedible. I was lucky enough to leave before being served.... the waitresses ignored us while we sat there for 10 min and didn't even care when we walked out.

also... the owner tends to hang out at the bar in the evenings with a woman who's obviously an escort. 

but... the nightime bartenders are nice.
