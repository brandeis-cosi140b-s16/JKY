Well, I wish this chain Was better, being one of the main restaurants at Flamingo with a great patio. It was horrible right off the bat. 

Came here on a Monday to kill a little time before our flight out. There was one server for the entire patio, which was steadily busy. I was a server for 5 years; I know, even a great server, cannot take care of 12+  tables and give adequate service. We were not greeted promptly, waited forever for drinks and even more foreverer (?!) for our food.  My comrades and I had beef enchiladas, Chicken tacos, and chicken sandwich. I don't think a single plate at our table was even half gone; food was just bad. No free chips and salsa like the good ole Mexican restaurants. Bland. Fatty and questionable meat. Ugh! Then we waited a while to get  out checks and eventually get out of there. 

Save yourself time and a happy belly to go anywhere else:: even the buffet, tropical cafe, or pizza joint at the Flamingo.
