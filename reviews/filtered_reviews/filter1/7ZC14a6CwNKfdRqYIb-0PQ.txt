While the building is amazing, the food is not good at all and the service is worse. We waited over 30 min after we paid our check to get a to-go bean burrito. The "acting manager" was also the cook and was not concerned about the issue. The corn was dried out and tasted like it was from a can. The cherry chipotle steak tacos got its flavor from the slathered on chipotle mayo. Phoenix KNOWS great Mexican food and this is not it. Save cash and go to Ranch Market. Our experience was an expensive nightmare.
