Just moved to this side of the valley. Wanted to try something new.  First mistake.  The restaurant setting fun...lots of stuff on walls and ceiling...and good music playing. That's where it goes downhill from. We were poorly greeted and sat at a table.  The waiter came by and was taking our order and I asked if they had a milder salsa than what was given with the chips when we sat down. He looked at me and said.." we don't got no mild "....with a very condescending tone and look. Every thing we asked for we had to ask for 2 or 3 times. 
After ordering it took 35 minutes for the food to arrive.
We told him the food my wife ordered was too spicy and he laughed and said " ha...spicy enough?"
The food was very bland on my plate, I got the ground beef Grand Burrito and it was a tortilla and meat.....nothing else.
When done we had to ask for the check 2 times and then it took 10 minutes to get it back.
I would NOT RECOMMEND THIS place to anyone.
