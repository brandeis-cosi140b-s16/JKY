I live downtown, I love downtown, and I'm so so happy to see more places such as La Comida opening up downtown.  However, this place is RIDICULOUSLY expensive.  2 Downtown Margaritas $18, 2 El Corral Margaritas $28, Guacamole $9 (really!?), Carne Asada $12 (which consisted of 2 tacos...basically $6 tacos), and Pollo al Horno $16.  With tip, $100 for dinner at a Mexican joint.  Food was good, service was good (although they could use a hostess stand in front as no one greets you when you walk in), and decor was nice.  However, I'll wait for Nacho Daddy to open up before having another Mexican meal downtown.
