Don't go to the new place here.  Go to Otro Cafe or Joyride. 

I know its closed now.  I had to write a review of my final meal here.

It was the worst experience I've ever had.  Sure, they were closing in 2 nights.  That does not excuse terrible service.  We waited 20 minutes for a drink.  Once we got the drinks we waited 20 minutes to order our appetizers.  Once the appetizers came out, we never saw our server again.  He purposely avoided us.  He was the guy with the ponytail.  We literally watched him move around waiting to catch his eye.  He wouldn't even look at us!  Finally we got up and asked for our check.  We wanted to stay to get tacos but obviously they didn't want the business.  We paid our bill and left to Joyride.  I won't even entertain the idea of going to the new place here.  Gallo Blanco and The Clarendon went from the top of my list to 'I'll never set foot in here again'.
