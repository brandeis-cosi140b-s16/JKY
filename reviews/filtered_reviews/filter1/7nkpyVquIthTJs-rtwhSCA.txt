We came here to do a quick & casual signing of the marriage certificate / lunch with family. It was 3 pm on a Saturday.
First let me say that The patio is beautiful !! I can see why people would come out here to sit on the patio & have a few drinks .  
We were a party of Apx 16. We were assigned 1 (one) waiter .. And you can guess how the rest of the visit went from there. The Poor kid couldn't tell if he was coming or going . Meanwhile there were 4 other severs inside the empty restaurant entertaining themselves with anything but serving the only customers in the establishment . Food eventually made its way out , it was ok. 
Will we be back? Absolutely not . 
Too bad
