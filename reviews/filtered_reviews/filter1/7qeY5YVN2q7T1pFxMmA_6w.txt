For my first time, I decided to go full out. I ordered a pineapple agua fresca, a carne asada quesadilla, and three carne asada tacos with joy rice. Chips and salsa were complimentary. 

My pineapple juice was great! Just the right amount of sweetness! 

Chips and salsa were okay. It needed more spice and flavor. The salsa tasted sweet to me. 

My carne asada quesadilla was BOMB! Probably the best food item I ordered. 

I got my meal about 35 minutes later. The waitress took forever with everything and I didn't like the tacos. The meat had a teriyaki flavor to them topped with some more sweet salsa. I disliked them very much. The rice was better than the tacos, but still tasted off. 

The decoration was nice. The atmosphere was clean. The best way I could describe this place was "Mexican food with a hippie twist." If that's what they were going for, they nailed it. This place would not be my first choice or on my list to go to again.
