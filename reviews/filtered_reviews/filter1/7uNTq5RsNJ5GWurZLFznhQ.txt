In a word, "Ew!"

My honey and I, in a moment of Mexican food desperation, stopped by Abuelo's because we've heard good things. 

People lie.

The chips were thin, which I normally like, but they were so thin they couldn't support the salsa. The salsa left much to be desired. While flavorful, the taste was surprising, but in a bad way-- like when you laugh really hard  and a little bit of pee comes out.

The margaritas were deceivingly generous. I filled my glass three times, but the alcohol content was very low. Were it not for the calories, I could have had five or six of them and still cleared a breathalyzer.

As for the actual meal, I don't know where to begin. I have had better Mexican food frozen from a box than I was served at Abuelos. The sauce tasted heavy of preservatives and more like something you'd get from a can. The pork and the beef on both of our dishes was chewy, and too, more like something you'd get from a can. Honestly, the whole meal was just ick.

The only possible redeeming aspect of the meal could have been dessert, but, alas, they don't serve your traditional Mexican desserts. Fried ice cream is not to be found anywhere on the menu. Of course, fried ice cream doesn't come in a can, so.. there ya have it.

I would avoid this restaurant. If you're in the mood for Mexican and are in the area, see some of my other reviews.
