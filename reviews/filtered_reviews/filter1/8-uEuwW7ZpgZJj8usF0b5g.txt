I've tried this place twice and the second time (Late October) for me was the last time. Food is ridiculously over priced and nothing special about it. They claim authentic Mexican food, in reality it was really a more upscale version of taco bell. $3 plus for one taco, I can easily find a REAL Mexican restaurant that way more food than what paz offered. Myself being a Mexican, I did not find this place appealing nor tasty.
