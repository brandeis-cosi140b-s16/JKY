I have not sat down to eat here, I have always got it to go. The food here is just bland. How people give it four stars just blows my mind. The food seemed like it was sitting around for awhile in the kitchen before beeing served. I live 2 blocks from the place, so it didn't happen because I had to drive home. 

I have given it multiple tries to make make sure it wasn't a one time bad mealI would not recommend this place to anyone.
