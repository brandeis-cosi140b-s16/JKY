One star because we had no service which in turn my husband and I chose to leave. I've managed in a restaurant and have been a server before, so maybe I'm a bit less patient for certain things...

Ambience is nice, the hostess was very nice as well. We were sat at a table that had dirty napkins stuffed into the pillows. We we're offered water right away but never approached by a server. It didn't even seem that busy. We sat for about 10min before we decided that we wanted to leave.

The most annoying thing was that the server at the table right next to us checked on the table several times while we sat there. Even if we weren't his table we should have still been acknowledged or there should be communication between the wait staff that a table has been waiting for service. 

Probably not going back :-/
