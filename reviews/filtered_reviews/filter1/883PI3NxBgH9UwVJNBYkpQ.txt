My daughter and I are here for lunch. We're not impressed. I got a salad, she got a burrito. The sizes are very small for the price compared to other places. The meat on my salad was overcooked and charcoal-ish. Daughter asked for sour cream, but they "don't serve that here". No crunchy tacos either. They also served her the burrito about 5 minutes before I got my salad, even though we ordered together.  We won't be back.
