We have never been here before so we asked what the supposedly owner recommends. He pointed to his ridiculous menu board which is placed inconveniently high above his head. his comments were not helpful so we ordered a shrimp with chili verde  salsa burrito. It was huge, salty and bottle tasting. I dont know how they stay in business for mediocre food, but horrible  customer service.
