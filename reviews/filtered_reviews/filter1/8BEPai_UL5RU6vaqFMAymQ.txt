The food was okay, hot and flavorful, the beans were dried on the plate but that can happen with a super hot plate, the $1 margaritas they had on special were deceiving. Tasted watered down and of poor quality. I wouldn't have minded so much except I was expected to pay $7 for food to drink a watered down tasteless margarita. Service left much to be desired. The only people that were friendly at all was the busser and the waitress I almost ran over on my way to the bathroom. I'm not impressed and will not be returning.
