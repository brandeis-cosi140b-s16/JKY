Very bad. We had been here maybe 3 years ago and did not remember much.  It is a great location though, & so we went.  We love Mexican food.  We have been to more Mexican places than I can count.  This has to be one of the worst.  When we sat down, seconds later, the waiter asks" ready to order"? No drinks offered, no appetizers offere..  We asked for a margarita.  Small or large?  That was it for choices. So, we went small.  Thank God.  Yucky.  Okay, moving on.. Ordered dinner.  I had a combo plate.  Hubby had a beef burrito.  Very basic.  When in doubt, don't stretch the kitchen.  Both our dinners were bad. Not even warm.  Tasteless, greasy. We had to ask for hot sauce.  The only condiment on the table was salt & pepper.  To top off the nite, hubby needed to use the restroom.  You have to walk outside to get to it? I heard the table next to us commenting on how dirty the restrooms were. All I can say is,save your money.  Go somewhere else.
