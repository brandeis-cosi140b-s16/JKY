Went for lunch yesterday.  We had a group of four for lunch and it took over an hour to get our food.  We had to send back the Chile Rellenos as ithey were cold in the middle.  Also, had to send back ice tea that looked and tasted quite weak.  The server did not seem to know how to brew stronger ice tea...really.  The best thing I can say is that our beverages were refilled three times before our food came.  Overall, food and service not good enough for lunch.  It might be best for them to not open for lunch and or just be a bar that opens 4pm till?  It sadly reminds me my past experiences at Cadillac Ranch in Town Square.
