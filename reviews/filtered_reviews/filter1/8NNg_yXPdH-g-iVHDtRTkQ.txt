This place looks like it would be fun for happy hour. We went for lunch. I felt it was high-priced for the portions. We had an order of guacamole, which only came with a few chips. When you share that with 3 people, the chips were gone within minutes. Asked for more and we got 3 more, but were also charged for the extra chips. I ordered the Kimchee Fried Rice with a regular iced tea, it was ok. The rice tasted horribly burnt, which ruined the meal. All I could taste was a burnt taste.  Again, for lunch and separate bills I will never understand why my bill for my portion was $25. It was only for my lunch. My friend had the tacos, the size of the tacos were laughable. Within 3 hours of having ate there, we were hungry. Not a filling place. But it looks like it would be fun for drinks. Needs work on the food.
