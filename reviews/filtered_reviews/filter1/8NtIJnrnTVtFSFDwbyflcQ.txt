Horrible!
After taking our food to 3 different tables, we finally flagged down the busser and told him it was ours!  Our server was pretty much non existent, took her forever to get us anything, like the check or a new glass of water because ours had a BUG in it!!!!!!
$10 for a side of guacamole!?!?!?!
Are you kidding?
The soup was disgusting and for $10 you received a 5 ounce bowl not even filled all the way up.  
If you're going to charge this much for your food it should be great!
I asked for extra sauce on my fish tacos and they put the extra side of sauce on my friends soup plate...who orders sauce with soup?? That doesn't even make sense, so I didn't get any extra sauce because we didn't know what it was for.  
I don't know why anyone would go here twice.
