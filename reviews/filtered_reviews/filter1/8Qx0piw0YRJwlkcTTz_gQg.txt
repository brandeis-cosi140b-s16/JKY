I would NOT recommend this place to anyone!!! I just went to... well..."dinner" here and it was absolutely horrific. The service was OK, the Margaritas where good, and the chips and guacamole weren't bad. However the $17.90 plate and $19.00 plate we ordered where disgusting!!! My boyfriend and I each tried each others and his tasted like throw up and did not look like what was explained on the menu and mine tasted like dirt with a slab of 2  dollar meat that was dry. I have had authentic Mexican food before and this...well... I don't know what this was!!! The "food" absolutely explains why this restaurant was on  "Unsolved Mysteries" makes you wonder whats in the food!?!?!
