Don't waste your money.  If it wasn't for the pleasant server ( who was taking care of way to many tables); I would give this place no stars. Believe the bad reviews and be suspicious of the positive ones.  

Food lacks flavor or personality and is over priced. Service is excruciatingly slow.  

I simply did not enjoy my meal and I am annoyed that I can never get the time back that I spent  waiting for my disappointing meal. I would rather eat at Chioplte or Cafe Rio. 

Mediocre food and abysmal service  at 4 star prices.
