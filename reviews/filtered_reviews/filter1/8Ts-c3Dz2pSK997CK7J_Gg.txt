Huge disappointment! I think they sold 2000 tickets for a 500 person venue. No room to move around. I had to wait in line for 20min just to move from the front part to the middle part of the venue. Then I had to wait another 10 min to get to the back. ....And now I just got kicked out for what I don't know. I asked the doorman what I did and he said "I can't tell you" I asked him again what I did so I don't do it again and his response was "we can do this the easy way or the hard way".... wow! Is this how an owner of a fine restaurant, "Pizza Bianca" runs an establishment? I'm sad to have to post this because I have heard nothing but good "word of mouth" about The Crescent. But after tonight I can see that they do not have a properly run business. THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!!!.... In my opinion.
