Horrible customer service. Our expectations at any airport are not high - many travelers are hurried, lost, rude, etc. understandably it's a tough job. If you are feeling up to being ignored from the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out, this is the place! The Barrio cafe in the Phoenix airport seems to have perfected "the annoying customer" role to a tee. Don't even try to be polite unless you have the overwhelming desire to pay a lot of money for what looked to be "ok" food and treated like a nuisance. Can't comment on the food as we walked out. I give them an A+ for perfecting horrible customer service, however they will not be getting my $$$.
