Just gonna say pass on this. Maybe it's because well I consider myself an expert on Mexican food. This place was Blah. I'm glad I didn't order anything I had 1 taquito and a taco from our party there. And was happy I didn't waste money on this overpriced junk. For casino Mexican food and value I will say earlier in day we had breakfast at Hussong's Cantina over Mandalay. Thumbs up for there. Going to review there in detail on their page.
