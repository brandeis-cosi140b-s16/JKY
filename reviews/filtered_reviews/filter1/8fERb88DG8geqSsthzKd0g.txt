I would not recommend going to Steel Cactus, unless you're just having drinks on the rooftop.  I went to dinner with 10 of my friends on Saturday night and we all had an awful experience.

Ambiance - the decor is nice...very modern, clean, and urban though it is quite possibly the loudest restaurant I have been to in Pittsburgh.  Granted it was a Saturday night, but we were forced to scream at one another just in our normal conversations.  

Service - given our large party size, we should have had 2 servers, though we had one frazzled and sadly under-trained waitress.  Steel Cactus also doesn't seem to have busboys, which would improve this experience.  It took us about 20 minutes to get drinks - and I'm talking about water and Diet Cokes in addition to margaritas.  Also I ordered a bottle of wine that never came (in fact the server just disappeared and forgot about it altogether)...the only saving grace was that it didn't appear on my bill. 

Food/Drinks - half our table liked their margaritas, while several others sent theirs back as they were terrible.  I got a vodka and soda and the soda was flat...and even their beers on tap were flat, so I think they just had issues that night.  I had a carne asada steak, which for $12.50 was a steal, but you could tell that it was old poor quality meat that was graying on the counter prior to it being cooked.

Overall, I wouldn't go back to Steel Cactus as there are better venues with mediocre/good Mexican food and better service and ambiance like Round Corner Cantina or Verde.
