My first unpleasant dining experience in Vegas. 

Service was great but what's going on with the food, the pricing, and the portions. 

The food started off great! Chips included with the chips and salsa were delicious and fresh. The chipotle salsa not so much. 

Thee 18 Monk Noodles was fine. Noodles were very good but the soy sauce was way overpowering. 

Mongolian beef wasn't great either. Actually it was terrible besides the fact that the Beef was cooked perfectly and served over romaine lettuce. The sauce was overpowering and not pleasant at all. 

The tacos are expensive, bland, and contain little fillings  

Tinga Poblana, Carnitas tacos are very bland. The only thing you could taste is the corn tortilla. 

We also had the spicy pork noodles. The sauce was not good at all and made me not want to continue eating. 

Overall a very expensive, bland and unpleasant dining experience. 

I would strongly suggest you not waste your money here.
