I ate here while visiting family and did not have a positive experience.  We were quickly seated but waited over 10 minutes for the waiter to come and ask if we would like water and to bring our chips and salsa.  He apologized and said they had and unexpected rush (it was 6pm on a friday, I think they call it dinner time).  The service continued to be lousy and the food left alot to be desired.  They obviously put alot more time and money into the ambiance then into their menu and service.
