We arrived really excited to have some delicious Cuban food and aside from taking our drink order the staff ignored us for 20 minutes. The customers who arrived after us were being served appetizers and getting their second border from the bar by the time I finally stopped a server asking that she please not pass by us again. A server arrived and informed me that she would be waiting on us and that she had not been informed by the hostess that we were "her table " . I left a five dollar bill on the table to pay for our beverages and informed the server that we were no longer interested in dining with them. As I left I asked the hostess why she failed to inform the server that we would be "her table "and she called the server a liar.
