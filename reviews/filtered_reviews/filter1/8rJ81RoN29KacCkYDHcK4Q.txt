The only reason to go to this place is because you are held captive at the airport.  It is extremely over priced even for airport food.  The nachos are $17 and barely enough for one person to enjoy.  Taco Bell has better nachos than here.  The Arizona burrito has no flavor and served with salty seasoned fries.  The  margaritas are very overpriced, small and no flavor starting at $10.
