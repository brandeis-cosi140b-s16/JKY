I'm not sure how this place stays open. The idea of the Tapas sound yummy but their food isn't very good at all. It's a wanna be "Firefly" type restaurant with a sports bar atmosphere.  I ordered the bacon wrapped dates and a few other tapas. The bacon was almost raw. My girlfriend ordered something with shrimp. The shrimp plate was a tapas plate with 5-6 shrimp... My girlfriend ate one shrimp and didn't like it, sent the plate back. I've been here a few times (with Groupons)... I doubt I'll ever return. Their drinks were ok but not worth the trip.
