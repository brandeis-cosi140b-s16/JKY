We could use a great Mexican Food place in the area, but this is not the one.  We took a group of friends here for dinner, and the place is a disaster.  The chips are a mix of flour and corn chips, which is alright:  the salsa is fresh tasting but way too mild.  We asked for something spicy and they brought us a bowl of sauce that was not even edible, it was something they must have whipped up in the kitchen on demand.  The chicken burrito was great on the inside, but the tortilla was lousy and the entire dish itself was way too salty.  Salty describes most of the food we ate.  The cheese they used in the dishes we ordered was bad, the dishes were served too cold, and the funniest thing of all is that you could not read the menus because the color of the menus blocked out the black lettering and made it nearly impossible to read.  The service was good, and the atmospere is good, but this place will not make it through the year with this kind of food.  They need to completely redo their menu, stick with Mexican Food, add some specialties and do something about the lack of good salsa. I will wait another couple of weeks and give it one more try.
