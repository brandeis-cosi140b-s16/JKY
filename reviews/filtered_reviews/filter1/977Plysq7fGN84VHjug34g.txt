The service was great, the drinks were good. We had chips and salsa and chorizo fundido. The chips and salsa were just fine. Nothing to rave about. The fundido was good, but there was no chorizo in it to be seen. I ordered the tortilla soup. Which was sort of like a bowl of enchilada sauce. I wouldn't recommend it. I had the grilled shrimp salad, it was good. My husband had the pork chili verde and it was not good. The pork was fatty and more like pork soup.
