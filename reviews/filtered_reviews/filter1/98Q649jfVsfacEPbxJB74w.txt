Horrible! Only good thing to say is you can't mess up a beer. The food was okay but we didn't eat it because we were so full from eating chips and drinking for an hour and a half while we waited for our server and then for our food. The manager apologized and took some off the bill. But to pay $60 for dinner my family and I didn't eat was no value at all.
