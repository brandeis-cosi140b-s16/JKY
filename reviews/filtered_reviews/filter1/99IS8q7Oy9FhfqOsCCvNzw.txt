My fiancee & I decided to have lunch there this Saturday. We arrived & sat at the bar area. Our table was dirty & the bus boy never came to clean. The bartender cleaned up for us & took our drink order. Our server never came to take our order. We asked the hostess & her reply was "I have no idea who your server is" . When our server came he asked us to go ahead & keep ordering from the bartender since we already got drinks from him. We go to Las Vegas several times a year and I will never go back to this place. Such a shame because we were really looking forward to trying the food.
