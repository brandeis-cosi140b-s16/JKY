Had heard great things about Richardson's New Mexican food and finally went.  Definitely did not live up to the hype! Tasteless, watered-down margueritas (both regular and prickly pear), rude and inattentive service, waiter strongly suggested both couples split food, then only brought one tortilla for each entrée and no extra plate, waiter acted very annoyed when we asked for more toast to go with our Roasted Garlic appetizer. Entrée was sooo hot it was inedible. Never asked if we needed anything or how the food was.  Very disappointing, will not return.
