So bad, equivalent of long john silver fish tacos and fries but waaaay more expensive. Not sure how this place has 4.5 out of 5 stars. The salsa bar is tiny you have to wait to get salsa and if your lucky there will be some left or some you can squeeze out of the nasty communal squeeze bottles everyone and their mother has been grabbing on...and also the nasty floor, from the door to the counter looked like a trail of dirt in an auto parts store. This is yet another example how yelp is loosing its dignity of a trustworthy review app to an over populous teen and tween review board showing their lack of experience and food expertise by just yelping to yelp, positive or other wise but definitely not educated. Because hands down this place sucked.
