Nope, not that great. Seriously.

For a $1.75 for a very small taco, not worth the price. Everything here is actually overpriced! People have told me to just eat the tacos not the plates, burritos, tostadas, etc. Cause you might get food poisoning.

Eh. I would ratehr go to another taco place down the street.
