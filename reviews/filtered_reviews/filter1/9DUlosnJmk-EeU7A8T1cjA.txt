What a sad experience. We stopped by the restaurant tonight around 6:30pm in celebration of our first date 13 years ago at On The Border. It didn't look too busy. The hostes welcomed us, grabbed our menus and started walking us to one of the many open tables. The manager suddenly walked up and told her not to seat anyone including us, told her to tell guests there was a 10 to 15 minute wait. We decided to wait. We waited for 20 minutes and the manager came out a few more times telling the hostesses not to seat anyone. After about 25 minutes we left. For a Friday night they were so understaffed, even for a partially filled restaurant. Kudos for the hostesses who were very apologetic.
