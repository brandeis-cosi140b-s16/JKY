This. Place. Sucks..
Here's my experience recently on a slow weeknight around 8:pm:

Ditzy hostesses checking their text messages when you walk in.
("sorry to disturb you, I'd like to spend some money here, please"?)

Sat at the bar, which was half empty.
Slow, unfriendly bartenders that don't want to be there. 
You just get the vibe immediatley.

After about 5 minutes watching the bartenders leaning on the bar a few feet away talking to each other, and trying unsuccessfully to get their attention as they walked past me back and forth a few times, I was finally able to order a $4 Bud Light that wasn't cold.

The bartender NEVER asked if I wanted to see a menu.
Had to get back to his deep meaningful chat with the other bartender.
btw, I do not blame the bartenders.
I blame this all on ownership & management (or lack thereof).

After he took my $5 for the beer (with tip), I had to wait to get his attention again and ask for a menu. He pretty much threw it at me, and walked off again.
DO I HAVE TO BEG TO SPEND MONEY IN THIS RESTAURANT?

No manager in sight.
Then I ordered some corporate-style, below-average food.
HIGH PRICES, like $16 for cheap, teeny, tiny burrito that taste like nothing.
Good luck with that, like there's no competition in AZ for Mexican Cantinas.

I did, however, notice lots of corporate beer & liquor company signage all over the place. THIS is what happens when a chain restaurant is ALL about corporate sponsorship dollars....

the OWNER(s) have forgotten about the food, the customers & the service.
