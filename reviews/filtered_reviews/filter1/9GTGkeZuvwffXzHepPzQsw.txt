I've always frequented this restaurant in the Las Vegas airport because the food was consistently good and it has a friendly and lively atmosphere. I ordered the chicken tacos as usual and what showed up looked completely different to what had become a favorite. The chicken was rubbery and yellow in appearance, The flavor was off and it came al la carte (no rice, beans & chips). I spoke to the manager who informed me that the menu had recently changed. Apparently, so have the taste buds of those responsible for this change. I will likely return but will not order what they refer to as chicken tacos again.
