I went with high expectations and was very disappointed. First off the concept is weird. Chinese and Mexican don't really go well together. We got a guacamole and vegetable fried rice for the table. The guac was good but the vegetable fried rice was just lame. The veggie fried rice at my local Chinese food restaurant is 10x better (and 10x less expensive!). I also got the fish tacos at $6.95 per taco which were very unspectacular and kind of soggy. All in all came out to $160 for 3 people (one guy was still hungry) without drinks. Would definitely not recommend.
