Let me start by saying it takes a lot for me to write a less than positive review.  I'd rather just not review at all... but this experience was just downright upleasant.

Our party of six arrived the other afternoon and loved the ambience.  The back patio is just great and we were seated pretty As other reviewers said the chips and salsa were very good.  

We got a picher of 'ritas, ordered for everyone and the food starting arriving.  When the waiter brought out an entree that nobody ordered, he looked at his pad and announced that I had ordered this dish and he was certain I had becuase "he wrote it down".  Well, unfortunately what he wrote wasn't what I ordered.  And no two ways about it, he was right and I was wrong.  Not the best attitude for the hospitality industry.  

As a side note, none of us - including one of our party who owns a restaurant in SF and our seven year old daughter - was impressed with the food.  The chicken in the dish I was served (again not what I ordered) was dry and quite overcooked, and another person in our party actually became ill during the meal.

Whatever.  Maybe it was that the staff was overworked - our waiter was doubling as the bartender and things were pretty busy.  Still, not up to the ratings or expectations.  Everyone has a bad day I guess

All of this might have been forgivable but for the final insult.  When the check arrived, the waiter had indicated we were a party of eight (we were six) and pre-added an 18% gratuity to the check.   Now we are regular restaurant patrons.  We behave well.  We tip well.  We don't complain all the time.  BUT  this might have been a case where I'd have only tipped 15% for the argument we received - perhaps this waiter was covering his back.  I don't know.  I do know that I'll never have the chance to find out if their average rating is deserved as we'll never return.
