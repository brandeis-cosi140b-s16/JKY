Unfortunately, I must update my review based on my most recent dining experience at Mi Patio.  The BF and I stopped in on a Saturday night for a late dinner right before closing.  I have a cast-iron stomach and I almost never have problems with anything I eat.  

I ordered the taco salad with beef machaca.  When it arrived, the beef was cold and I only ate two bites as a result.  I surmise the beef had been left out to cool (probably for too long) since the restaurant was about to close.  Needless to say, a few short hours later in the middle of the night I came down with the worst case of food poisoning I have ever experienced.  This wasn't "Oh, I don't feel so good" food poisoning.  This was, "Should I go to the hospital?" food poisoning.  It was so bad I was unable to travel for work the following week.  

Mi Patio is now permanently off my list of acceptable eateries; it's just not worth the risk.  Adios, Mi Patio!
