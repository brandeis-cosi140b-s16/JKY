Gave this place a second try.. And now I can officially say that I do not like this place at all. You can get MUCH better food and service at an endless number of places in Charlotte. I spent $75 on the worst dinner ever, and am sad I can't get my money back for such a waste. 

The waiter we had, Matt, was the absolute worst. I manage a restaurant, and I've been a server... He should not be serving.

And the most important part - my food was SO bland and weird - (carrots and zucchini and other veggies in a fried taco bowl?) so I said I didn't like the food, but that im willing to pay for it and just take it home, and that I can order something else.. Matt didn't apologize, or even care to ask how he can make it better. I ordered another meal, which was my third entree (including my boyfriends) and ended up paying the $75. 

It was my boyfriends birthday... The only thing he enjoyed was the $2.75 buckshots.

All around - Horrible horrible horrible horrible, and even more horrible.
