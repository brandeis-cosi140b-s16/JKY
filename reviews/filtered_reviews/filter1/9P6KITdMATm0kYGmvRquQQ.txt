I don't think I've ever given anyone a 1 star but I think it was well deserved.  I waited a good 7 mins to be greeted and that was only because the manager who was having a meeting close to me saw I was waiting long so he walked to where the bartenders were hiding and talked to them.  When the blonde bartender approached me I asked for a menu.  She handed it to me and turned away so fast she didn't hear me say I wanted a drink but the people near me heard me just fine.  The guy next to me said he was waiting 30 mins for his food. OUCH! finally another bartender came to take my drink order. It took awhile for that to be made then when they dropped that they took my food order.  The food didn't take too long since it was a salad. The Cobb salad was huge and delicious.  Ask me how many times the 2 two bartenders came to check on me? ZERO! Take tsk. The blonde bartender came by about 20 mins after I got my food to make sure I got it because she saw a salad sitting on the line. Really? That's when you come to check on me...and still no "how was everything? " the manager asked as I was closing out how the food was...but not his staff.  I don't think I'll be visiting this location anymore.
