I went through the drive through for a breakfast burrito. They were pretty busy so it took about 15 minutes to get my food. It seemed a bit long, but I can handle it. After driving home, I realized I had been given a completely wrong burrito and chose to drive back to get my order corrected. As I waited at the register to talk to someone, SEVEN separate times, workers walked past the register, made eye contact with me, and continued with whatever they were doing. I get if you're busy and in the middle of something, but at least acknowledge you know I'm there and will be with me shortly. Having worked in a drive thru location before, I understand that entirely. 

Finally someone greeted me at the register and without making eye contact with me, she asked what she could help me with. I informed her I got the incorrect order and finally she looked up at me. The individual who got my order on accident was actually behind me and gave his back to her as well. Within 5 minutes, he received his correct order and left. I was still waiting there for my order, just watching the kitchen to see if they were even making mine. Fifteen minutes go by and finally the manager, I assume, asked me what I was waiting for and ended up making my food for me. 

Needless to say, I won't be coming back due to their blatant act of ignoring people because it was inconvenient to them at the time. To be genuinely honest, I felt I was treated differently because I wasn't of their ethnicity. That sucks, because I don't care about that. But to see them talk to other customers with eye contact and have more of a sense of urgency when they're the same ethnicity, and then not see it done with yourself...it's difficult not to think that it's due to your skin color. Too bad, because the breakfast burritos are great and I love them. But I won't be going back to an establishment who seems to treat individuals differently. 

Thank you to the manager who actually recognized I was waiting for a while.
