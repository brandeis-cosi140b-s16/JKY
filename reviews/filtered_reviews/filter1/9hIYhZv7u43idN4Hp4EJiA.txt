Has been years that haven't been there and I am still pissed at how poorly we were treated there. Maybe it has changed but I will never step foot there ever again. Food was OK I guess but the service was horrible. If you like your food to be thrown in your face by the waitress and you have to clean up HER mess, you should go there. Oh, and bring your own utensils since they don't seem to be willing to provide them. The manager couldn't have cared less, the staff just seemed to be going thru the motions. Horrible experience.
