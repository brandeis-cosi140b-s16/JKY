This place put the dirt in dirtbag. I hate saying bad things about a place but this bar captures all of the bad things about Tijuana (not Mexico, but the complicated border town with high crime and low American morals). The drinks are OK. This place caters to a younger uncultured crowd. I think I was just too old to be there and I'm in my mid thirties.
