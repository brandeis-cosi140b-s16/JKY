Tslk about Over Priced and Price Gouging Food, you'll want to find another Mexican Restaurant.  Three ( they call it "street" tacos) for lunch, more like appetizers.for $11.50.  

We were served a small glass of "Warm" Wather, had to ask for glasses of ice water. I guess they can fool the touriss but not the Locals. Not to mention unfriendly waiters and poor service.

Better to go to Taco Bell!
