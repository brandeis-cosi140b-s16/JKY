My boyfriend and I went to the Eastern location Thursday, March 12, 2015 at 3:55pm. We were so excited to finally try out Nacho Daddy! Our waitress Kim was great, and very sweet. We ordered the "Buffalo Hot Nacho" as an appetizer, my bf ordered the "Daddy's Bowl with Marinated Filet Mignon" and I ordered the "BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich". 

The nachos took about 20 minutes to arrive immediately followed by our entrees. The waitress apologized for the kitchen being backed up and somewhat out of order. We weren't thrilled that all of our food arrived at the same time but it was no big deal to us. 

The buffalo nachos were really runny with buffalo sauce and the sandwich was ok. My boyfriend said his bowl was ok, nothing really worth coming back for. 

We left disappointed with the quality of the food but the service was in fact great! Unfortunately both of us became violently ill later that day due to food poisoning from the nachos. It was the only thing we shared and the only thing I had eaten all day so we knew that's what it was. We have both been so sick for over 24hrs due to the food being prepared incorrectly. 

This was the first and last time we will ever be going there.
