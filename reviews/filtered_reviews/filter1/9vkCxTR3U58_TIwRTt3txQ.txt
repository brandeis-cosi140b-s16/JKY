The worse place that i have done in the last 2 years. 

it took 15 min until then took our order , then the food came 50 min after,
half of the rest. was empty but the dont care. 
even talking with the manager didnt help ( of course he came after 15 min that we asked)

again  if you want to west a lot of time ( 1.5 - 2 hours ) to get food this is the place
