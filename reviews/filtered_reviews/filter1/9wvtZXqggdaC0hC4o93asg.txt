My family and i had a bad a experienced here. We gave this place a chance and i must say we weren't pleased with the food. My steak tacos tasted like paper with a taste of cilantro and onion(hint of salt might helped and maybe not forgetting to add a couple lime would help). Steak felt chewy. Just didnt have any flavor. My son complained he didnt like his chicken quesadilla and I believed  him when i tried it. Someone over loaded with salt. Condiments like hot sauce tasted like water down vinegar. My family said the salsa tasted like water and a hint of tomatoes but chips was great. Probably would never go back. I recommend getting new cooks or someone with better taste buds.  Im from California and this is the worst Mexican food i had so far.
