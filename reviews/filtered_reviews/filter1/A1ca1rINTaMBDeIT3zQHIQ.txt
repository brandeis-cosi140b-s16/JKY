Not much to say about this place. K.O. saw this on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. We were in the area so we decided to give this place a shot.  Boy were we disappointed. We dont know if this place once had good food but they definitely dont anymore.   

Texano-dry flavorless meat 
Pastor-pineapple doesn't belong, flavorless also
Carne molida-weird flavor, also flavorless

I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone and would steer clear of this spot.
