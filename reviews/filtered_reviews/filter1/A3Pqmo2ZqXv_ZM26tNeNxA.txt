what is wrong with you peoples taste buds, all coldl luke-warm food Worst restaurant in the free world...Terrible inexcusable service from 1 particular server,expensive Mexican food so dont expect to be ordering a combination plate with rice and beans for only 6 bucks, try $14.99. Everything we ordered came luke warm to cold and had to be sent back. I believe our surly waiter was an old queen named Jose. with a chip on his shoulder and sporting a lot of jewelry and a rhinestone watch. Very rude, innatentive, never once smiled until we called the very gracious manager over who never really apologized for his behavior but instead offered us a complimentary dessert. The magaritas were like watered down kool-aid, no lliquor, no tartness, no bite, everything was super bland and blah. Once we complained about the staff 2 other tables complained also and then the server kept running over to the tables acting very phoney and attentive.Never ever again. get rid of that waiter asap. please or you might be going out of business
