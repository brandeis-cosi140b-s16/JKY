Three strikes......you're out!! Gave it a 3rd chance as I ended up at the Casino for my Mexican Friday.....if you are into $11 margaritas and sub-par mini tacos at $4 each... then go! Meat in tacos/nachos is absolutely inedible!![pork/steak]  $45 for 1 person for a couple of marg. 2 tacos and sm. guac.?? I am worried about this place!!  Not near the crowds they have drawn....wonder why???
