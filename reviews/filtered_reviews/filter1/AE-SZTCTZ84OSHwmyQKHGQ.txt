Ma√Ætre d'  gratuitously, breathtakingly rude as we walked in. I gave him a chance to simply apologize and he used it to justify his rudeness. Full disclosure: I didn't know whether we'd have 5 or 7 guests (it's ebertfest). Fact is I wasn't rude to him: he treated me like he thought I was an idiot. A basic principle of good resto services is to avoid gratuitous meanness, even during ebertfest. I'm a local, love their food and won't go back. People deserve to be treated with basic civility, esp when they are civil to you. The second waiter's apology later sounded a bit more genuine, but not enough. Goodbye Escobar's. I hardly knew you, but I'm not coming back, and I'll be telling my friends. I recommend not going.
