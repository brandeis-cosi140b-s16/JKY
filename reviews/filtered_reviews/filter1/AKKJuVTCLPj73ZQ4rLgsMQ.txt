We were told when we made our reservations that they probably wouldn't be necessary which proved to true.  There was a free concert by Genevieve on the green that evening so the terrace was full, but the dining room was empty with the exception of one other table.  The restaurant itself is beautiful, but I doubt overhead expenses are covered except on weekends.  The waitress asked if we wanted guacamole with our chips and we responded affirmatively.  The guacamole was very good and we were amazed that it was complimentary since other restaurants charge $6-10 per order.   The restaurant serves both traditional Tex-Mex dishes and "fresh" seafood entrees.  We each chose the "fresh" halibut in spinach cream sauce which was accompanied by chipotle mashed potatoes, green beans and carrots.  The halibut was overcooked and I was surprised, but shouldn't have been, to find a $6 charge for the guacamole included on our bill.
