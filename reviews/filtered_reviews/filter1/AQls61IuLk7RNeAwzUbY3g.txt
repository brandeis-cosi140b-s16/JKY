I've been there twice, and both times the burritos were just... bland, really. I mean, they literally tasted like NOTHING, as if they were filled with Styrofoam. It tastes like what I'd imagine hospital burritos would taste like. I really WANT to like this place, but it's kind of hard when Taco Bell runs circles around you in the spice department!
