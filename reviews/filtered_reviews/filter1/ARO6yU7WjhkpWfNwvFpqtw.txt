We were suckered into checking out Carlos' n Charlie's on a Thursday evening by one of the guys walking around the hotel handing out wristbands. He told us that we would get in for free with an open bar. Awesome, right?! Well, the wristband was good for the cover, but we had to pay $20 per person to get a red solo cup that was good for four drinks only. 
We went in expecting to get out money's worth and were really disappointed with the crowd. Sure, it was Thursday, but there were maybe 20 people inside. Whatever. 
We went to the bar and got decent service from a flashy bartender with a whistle who poured essentially a red solo cup full of vodka. Awesome, right?! Yeah, if you reallllllyyyy love vodka. We couldn't have finished four drinks unless we wanted to end up in the ER. So it really ended up to be a $20 cup of vodka.
Also, the DJ was just awful. Occasionally he would play a song that people knew and would dance to, but he was sloppy and the music was terrible. I think there are many better places in Vegas to spend your money!
