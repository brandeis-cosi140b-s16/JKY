I came here on a whim today with a craving for mexican food. The inside of the restaurant was dark, quiet, and unappealing. Ordered the Carne Asada burrito and it was finished and ready to go within two minutes which is a bad sign, because it wasn't fresh. The meat had no flavor, tasted like it had been sitting in water for a while and was just generally tough. Rice was mediocre, beans looked/tasted like taco bell powdered beans, and the horchata tasted like sugar water. Avoid this place at all cost.
