The voucher I bought on groupon did not match the restaurant offer. Please don't advertise false information if you can't give the deal. The food was terrible I gave it to my dogs and heads up the AC is out this place is old and run  down no AC in 100 degree weather wtf ! Hmm gee im glad I didn't get the shrimp cocktail Buyer beware the waitress never understood anything I asked about why they did not honor the voucher This place is a straight dump.
The food was terrible.
