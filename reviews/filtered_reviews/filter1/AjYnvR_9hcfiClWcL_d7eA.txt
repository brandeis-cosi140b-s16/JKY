went after reading positive reviews and craving authentic mexican food. BUT this was HORRIBLE. Staples like chips and salsa were stale and bland respectively. But to make matters worse, my fajita was the most disgusting thing ever. The chicken was fried to the point that I could not chew it, and the veggies were covered in grease, and the whole thing was cooked in Soy Sauce! Is that traditional?? It was a nasty overall experience...
