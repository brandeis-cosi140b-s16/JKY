If only zero stars was possible.  After having my nephew for an appointment at Children's Hospital, we thought we would try Barrio for lunch.  We arrived at 10:55 to find that they were not open (according to the door they open at 11).  The doors were open as repairmen were walking in and out.  We stood in the parking lot until 11 at which time my sister walked in to see if we could be seated.  She was promptly escorted back out the door having been told they were not open yet.  After 5 more minutes of standing in the parking lot we decided to leave.  I walked in to tell them that they had lost our business.  The staff's only response?  "Well, if you care to wait we'll be open in a few minutes".

Incredibly poor customer service.  You never, EVER leave customers standing outside.  Is the food good?  We'll never know as I certainly won't try them again.

My suggestion?  Head around the corner to Juan's instead (we did!).  Not only do they open at 10, the family that run it is very nice and the food was fantastic...and CHEAP!

Skip the Barrio hype.  WAY too many other great places to eat in that neighborhood.
