This was by far the shittiest service in vegas! (And I live here) so that says a lot! We literally had to go up to the bar ourselves after waiting about 10 minutes for the beer we asked for twice! Also the bartender seemed to have a terrible attitude and often ignored us, that is why we left to a table hoping for better service.. The food was mediocre.. I still left a tip just to be courteous but on my way home was regretting it! Will definitely NEVER be back!!! If I could leave a smaller rating I would! The only people who were attentive were the blonde with "sancha" on her name tag, and the guy with the cool mustache who helped us out more than our server. Not sure if he was a cook or waiter.
