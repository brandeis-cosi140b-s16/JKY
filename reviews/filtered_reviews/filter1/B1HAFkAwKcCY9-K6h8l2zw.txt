I always believe in second chances but I should have just left it at that. I gave them more like 5 chances and each one was the same bad service. First, we walk in and we have ditsy hostesses who act like they have no idea what they are doing. I don't think there is even a floor plan for the servers. I don't think I have been approached and ackknowledged in under 15 minutes. The waitresses are sitting at the bar flirting with the guys for bigger tips. I think it's pretty safe to say that servers can see that we have not been helped if we are sitting at the table without drinks. The problem is they don't care. I blame that more on the manager than anyone else.
       The last time I waited and even got a look from a waitress with the hope that we would be ackknowledged. Nope! Walked right past. I had enough so I got up and left and made sure to let them know that they missed out on a money making opportunity. I hope this place gets replaced with a restaurant that values customer service!
