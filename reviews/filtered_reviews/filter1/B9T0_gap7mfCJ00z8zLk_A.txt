DO NOT GO!

Food.  Boring.  Drinks. Average.  Bartenders, chime in when when drunk patrons are making things uncomfortable.  Wish this place was worth while, but the food has no creativity and the bartenders make a stale maragarita at best.  Maybe this place is better for lunch, but after dinner, they may have sleeping bags for nap time.
