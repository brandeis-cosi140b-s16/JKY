If I could give this place 0 stars I would! Worst Mexican food I have ever had in my life! The food was extremely bland and soggy. Salsa tasted like it was straight outta the Jar. (yuk)The old man server told us in his 100 years of working there he had only one other person complain. LOL I hardly doubt that.
