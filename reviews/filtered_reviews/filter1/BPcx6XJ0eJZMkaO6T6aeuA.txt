I wish I would have received half of this amount of concern from the manger that I DID share mg concerns with immediately after eating. The manager was not concerned in the least that we were u happy and do find it interesting that you know exactly who we are out of ALL of the parties of 6 you had  at this time. The fact the manager laughed at me when I called to make our original reservation, the fact that NO honey came with our soapailla and my friend paid $6.00 for 3 tablespoons of guac were left off of the original review. No hurt feelings- we won't be back and I will continue to let everyone I know how horrible this place, especially the manager was.
