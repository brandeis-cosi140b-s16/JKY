This is the worst Mexican food I've ever had in my life! Trust me I've had tons. Some from pretty slummy places that were way better than this overpriced garbage. It was absolutely terrible. The shrimp in the shrimp tacos tasted as if they found some old overfried, threw it in a tortilla, and decided to call it a taco. On top of that the rice and beans were ice cold as if they just pulled the out of the fridge and then served them. Come on guys! Really! At least have some respect for yourselves, if not for your customers. The only thing that was enjoyable was the margaritas. But seriously this is Las Vegas you can get a margarita anywhere. Don't support this disgrace to Mexican cuisine. Go somewhere else. If your downtown and crave Mexican food venture off a little bit and try one of the many taco carts. You'll save money, enjoy the food, and not end up with the bubble guts.
