Been here once and was enough for me for not coming back. Had coworkers that didn't want to go anywhere far and chose this establishment for dinner, so I joined even tough I knew wasn't gonna be good. Had the camarones tacos and the quality of the food was so cheap that I couldn't believe how people can offer that. The grilled shrimp were so small and seemed the ones that you microwave. I wish yelp would let us rate half star because that would be more appropriate as rating. Never again!
