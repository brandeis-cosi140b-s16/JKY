I just moved here a few months ago from chicago and have been craving a big awesome burrito like the ones back home.. filled with sour cream, fresh tomatoes, lettuce, cheese, meat, maybe some guac all rolled up in a tender tortilla...mmmm....big glass of horchata...

...I was not expecting this taco bell sized burrito stuffed with nothing except for the meat I ordered. A little lettuce and whiteish red tomato on the side was all I had to pretend it was veggie stuffed. :-( and to think I passed up the delicious shrimp tacos at rubios for this? AND paid over $7 for this :'( no bueno.
