I took my aunt and my mom here, I heard it was a great place, never again will I go back, we ordered chips and spinach dip for about $11.00 chips were stale and old, I asked for new ones, same thing, old and stale, I asked for a manager he came out and told us he could not afford to pay a prep person to cook fresh chips, because they pay there people $30.00 an hour to cook. I'll take a job there, lol I guess they don't believe in multitasking.  Then our $17.99 chicken quesdill came out, cheese was hard and cold, tortilla was hard and dry, we ordered 2 only got 1 thank goodness because they were horrible, the only thing that was good were the margaritas, little to much ice but the taste was good.  Food was way to expensive, maybe the have to charge that amount to pay those cooks who make $30 an hour, lol.
Will never go back, server was nice, not her fault, food sucked.
I'll find somewhere else to take my family,  
Like casa flores in Boulder city, now that's an awesome place for Mexican food, we just happened to be in the treasure island that's why we went to senior frogs.
Best food in Boulder city, casa flores, don't waste your time in senior frogs..
