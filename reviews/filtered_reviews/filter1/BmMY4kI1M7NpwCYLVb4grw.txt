I live right next door and thought I would try it out. Got the blue corn enchiladas, there was no sauce so the chicken was dry. Asked if the chicken was shredded and they said yes and of course it was cubed. I also asked for no beans and they threw them all over my plate. I gave one star for the spiceyness and cheese. They were also rude to me when I brought my dog, when they have no sign on their building that says that you can not have a dog there. What place in Arizona doesn't allow dogs on the patio?
