Not very good.   I showed up for a 2 pm lunch.  The server bothered me by calling me, "My Man" and by trying to sell me on everything.  I do not want a Cadillac margarita!   I really wanted steak fajitas, but at $17.49 you have priced me out.  I settled for the chicken fajitas.  Lunch portion.  Wow. Tiny. No flavor.  No veggies. No sour cream. No guacamole. And by no, I mean barely.  Also, small basket of chips.  Super small bowl of salsa. $6.29 for a beer?  On draft? Really?
