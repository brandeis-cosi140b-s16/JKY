I've heard a lot about Cabo Fish Taco, from friends in Charlotte and from Food Network.  I decided it was time I found out what all the fuss is over.  I'm now left wondering just what, exactly, all the fuss IS over.  Cabo has generated a lot of hype, but does not have the substance to back it up.

Given that it was a Saturday night, I assumed there would be a bit of a wait.  We were told we'd have a table in 10 minutes, and the hostess was pretty accurate.  After initially getting our names on the wait list, though, she could have done without immediately telling us we were in her way (in those words, exactly).  We made it to our table, and the waitress promptly greeted us and took our drink orders.  We inquired about the specials on the chalk board, only to find out those were from yesterday and no one got around to updating the sign.  We placed our orders from the regular menu.  And waited.   And waited. And watched other tables, who were seated AFTER us, receive their orders BEFORE us.  Mind you, half the restaurant is still empty.  After 45 minutes of waiting and inattentive service from our waitress, she explained there was a mix up in the kitchen.  She was unable (unwilling?) to compensate us in any way for such poor service.

The food finally arrived and I was unimpressed.  It tasted good, but not Food Network, everyone's-talking-about-it good.  The tacos were more lettuce than fish and the slaw was rather bland.

When you add it all up, and factor in the fact that the place is so loud it's impossible to do more than look at the other people at your table, I felt like I had wasted my money and the better part of my evening on a miserable experience.  Needless to say, I won't be giving Cabo a second chance.
