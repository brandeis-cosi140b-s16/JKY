I live within walking distance of CFT and used to go here all the time. I used to line their food. Now, it's all gone down hill. I don't know what happened. Every time I've eaten there recently it's terrible. Cold sides, stale chips, fish not fresh... Recently I got the veggie fajitas. I'm still gagging thinking about it. Tastes like old Chinese food (yeah,not Mexican) that had been sitting in a styrofoam box in the fridge for a week then heated up in the microwave. It was so gross. I didn't finish it. So last week I went there (why? Not sure) and I got a simple vegetable wrap with some ranch sauce and a side of fruit. The fruit tasted fine, not freshly cut but maybe like pre cut my Harris teeter or something. Anyway I started feeling an upset stomach after the first part of the wrap. I boxed the other half and took it home. I tried to finish it at home and within 30 minutes I was projectile vomiting. It lasted the entire day. I threw up around 25 times that day. I have never felt so sick. That food was the first and only thing I ate that day and I never ever throw up usually. I couldn't keep anything down the entire day, not even water or medicine, I felt like dying and that wrap poisoned me! Definitely my last experience at cabo will be connected with some brutal food poisoning memories. Ew
