Absolute nightmare. We had a large group but that was no excuse for the poor customer service. Took over 15 minutes to get drinks. Had to get our own chips and salsa. Food orders were wrong. Drink orders were wrong. Completely forgot someone's order. Avoid at all costs. Much better options to choose from in the neighborhood. Wouldn't be surprised if it was closed soon. Wish I could give it zero stars.
