Don't be misled by the name. If you have to tell customers this is real Mexican food, it likely not. And that is exactly what I found here on my first visit. 
First of all they don't sell any "Aguas frescas". That's right no horchata here. 
Ordered a Pepsi and got a rootbeer. 
I ordered fajitas, which were very bland and over cooked. The plate of fajitas included more onions and pepper than actual meat.  Plus I think it was priced a little high at $14.95. 
My wife had a plate that included chipotle flavored steak. She disliked it so much that she asked to waiter to take it back. And they did. 
The tortillas were hardly warm. 
The one thing I did like was the salsa and the quick refills on chip and drinks. 
I visited the restaurant with 5 other people and non of us care too much for this food.  
In conclusion, I will not be returning to this place, nor will I recommend it. 
If you are in the mood for Mexican food, go else where.
