This place used to be okay...reliable.

Went on a Saturday afternoon - not a busy time.  Sat there for a while waiting for service and was eventually helped.  I ordered a chicken taco salad and a small cheese crisp.  The plate the taco salad came had a pool of liquid on it - so I tried to move it on to another plate on the table and it collapsed into a disgusting puddle of wetness.  The server kindly offered to bring me another - which I took her up on.  Pretty much the same thing.  I think the lettuce must be very wet or something, I don't know.  The whole salad was mooshy and warm and the chicken tasted like cat food.  Ok, I haven't actually eaten cat food - but it smells like this stuff tasted.  No mas, Sylvia's.  No bueno.
