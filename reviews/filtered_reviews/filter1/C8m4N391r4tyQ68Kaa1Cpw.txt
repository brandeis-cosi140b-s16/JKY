This place has horrible customer service they will not even separate checks for their customers, they leave you waiting wanting drinks, in Las Vegas you are pretty thirsty and you need refills the food is just ok, I just can't believe the horrible customer service. Go to Jalisco's Mexican restaurant it's so much better and they treat the customers as they should be treated
