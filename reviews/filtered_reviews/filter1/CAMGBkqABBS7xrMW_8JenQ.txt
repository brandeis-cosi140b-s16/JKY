If you feel like paying $35 for a horrible margarita and some soggy nachos, this is your spot! I've come in here twice now because the lure of a margarita is too much to fight but I've left disappointed every time. Their drinks are awful tasting and they are extremely overpriced, even for airport food. The service has been decent though.
