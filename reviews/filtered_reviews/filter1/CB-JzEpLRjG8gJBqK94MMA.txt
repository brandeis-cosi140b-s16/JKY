Dropping my review to 1-star after noticing I'm a victim of a tipping scam at this restaurant. My bill from 04-29-2015 was $24.86 and I left a $6.00 tip making my total $30.86. Upon checking my statement, it looks like the waiter decided to write himself a $60.00 tip instead!!! I am furious right now as my credit card statement shows that I was charged not $30.86, but $84.86 instead!!!

I've been here at least ten times now and I have to say, pleased 90% of the time. The only time that I wasn't happy involved the AVN convention having booked the entire place out and El Dorado not having space for us. 

In general, every item on the menu is great. My favorite is the fajitas, all different meats. The guacamole is a must get for your chips, and the margaritas are pretty amazing too. I think the only item I didn't like from here was the enchiladas.

And everything is organic and GMO free!
