It was my first time getting anything from this place, and considering that I'm Mexican I figured I would be lenient on this place since I knew it was going to be whitewash Mexican food, so I called my order in (Pollo Asado, and 2 tacos) and the guy told me it would be about 20 minutes. I only live like a block away so after 15 minutes I strolled on down there. When I walked in, no one really greeted me or even took notice, so after about 5 minutes someone finally asked me if I had been helped, I told the girl I came to pick up my order. They said it would be right up, but I proceeded to wait another 45 minutes. While I was waiting I got to observe the prep cooks continually texting with their gloves on and then go back to preparing peoples salads, and guacamole, Yuk!  Finally I got my food and rushed home only to realize that I got a mediocre piece of chicken with BBQ sauce on it? WTF I thought this was Mexican food? The tacos were ridiculously tiny, and the meat was cold! I'll never set foot in this place ever again. . You've been warned.
