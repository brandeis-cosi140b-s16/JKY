Would never eat in this restaurant again.  Lousy food and the service was worse.  Took a friend there who came in from Florida.  Our friend ordered a cup of soup before dinner and it came out in only what I can describe as something not much bigger than a thimble.  Then the waitress tells us that this is their sampler so our friend ordered a bowl of soup.  It was huge.  We laughed so hard.  The food was supposed to be Mexican.  But having spent considerable time at some of the best restaurants in Mexico, the food here would be laughable if it wasn't so bad.  No flavor, nothing.  Really not good.  And the waitress.  Talk about attitude.  Kept calling our friend "missie" or "me lady".  Seriously?  Let me give you a hint.  You are a waitress, not the Queen.  Being a waitress or waiter is a tough job so we go out of our way to be nice.  Not a job that I would want.  But, your job is to be nice, give good service, etc.  The wait staff here needs serious traiining.  I was watching one of the waiters put plates on the tables.  He would neatly lay out the plates and then to position, he would put his hand in the middle of the plate, palm down, to shift if around, to put it in place.  Not sure where his hand had been before placing the plates, but what a turn-off.  Hopefully he just didn't come from the bathroom, or worse.  This place is nothing more than an embarassment.  So sorry to have taken our out of town friend to this place.  If it lasts a year I would be surprised.
