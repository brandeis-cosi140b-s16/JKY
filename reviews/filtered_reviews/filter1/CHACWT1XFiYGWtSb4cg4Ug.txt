I've ordered delivery here a few times but tonight was the worst, I was at work (I work graveyard) and was hungry, no other restaurants was open at the time that would be able to deliver so I chose to order from here. I ordered the pelmeni & a bowl of their special soup of the day (I got some sort of beet soup). All was good until 30 mins after I started feeling ill & started vomiting....I really wanted to like this place after all the good reviews but unfortunately after what happened to me tonight I don't think I'll ever order from here again :/
