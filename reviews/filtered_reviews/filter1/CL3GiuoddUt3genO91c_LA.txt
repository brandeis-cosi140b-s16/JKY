Lst night, 2/11/15, my wife and I joined a birthday celebration for a friend with 10 other friends. My wife's dinner was not good.  The chicken was all dried out and she sent it back saying it wasn't good.  They did not offer her another meal nor did they take the cost off the bill.  I had a combination of two burritos, one chicken and the other pork and both meats were dried out, but I ate it.  I would never go back there again.
