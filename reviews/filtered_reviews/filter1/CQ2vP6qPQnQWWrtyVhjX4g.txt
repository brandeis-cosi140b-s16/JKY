Dined here with my mom on Sunday at 11:00 am. It took sometime to get seated although there were only 2 other people dining there. Water was brought to the table in cloudy water spotted glasses. order 2 iced tea's. These glass were unatractive also. Menus were sticky and dirty. Ordered the 1/2 order of guacamole with chips. Nothing special there. Got 3 tacos. I the queens specialty,1 smoked salmon and 1 chicken. I took a small bit of each. The beef tasted odd. The Salmon was gross. Chicken one was terrible too. I ordered some pico de gallo and it tasted old. Mom had beef taco and it was unedible. We sent our food back and went next door to The Herb Box and had an excellent luch. Run don't walk from Barrio Queen!
