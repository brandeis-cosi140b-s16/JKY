This place stinks. I only wish I could give zero stars for my rating. Here is some advice go around back and pick the scraps out of the dumpster and save yourself having to pay for the garbage they pass off as food there. My buddy took me here and raved how great the food was......he is a liar. I wont even talk to him anymore after my experience at restaurant mexico. The food was bad, the service was worse, the best part about eating there was leaving.
