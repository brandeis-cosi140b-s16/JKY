Sorry. No. I'm not sure what the appeal is. 
I ordered 2 tacos: carne asada and al pastor. I imagined tacos like I've had at authentic Mexican taco stands, given the high reviews. What came out? 2 TINY tacos, not double-layered corn tortillas, (instant no-no--not authentic without 2 corn tortillas to hold in the goodness that is a Mexican taco) al pastor filled with mystery bright, hot pink meat (not a normal meaty-pink color), and over-cooked carne asada. The salsas come in a variety of flavors and spiciness. The spicy salsa? Not spicy, at all. The price? Too much for my teensy tacos. If I were you I'd pass, there are fabulous taco stands nearby with horchata just as good or much, much better. One star for the horchata that accompanied the meal.
