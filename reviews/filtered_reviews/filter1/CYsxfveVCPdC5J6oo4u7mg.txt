Sub par Mexican at Strip prices! Anyone who says this is great needs their head examined. Their Cadillac Margarita was completely watered down. I'm not convinced there was any tequila in it. My wife's carnitas sucked - it's like they were pre-cooked bad reheated. My chimi was the worst I've ever had and the equivalent of Taco Bell. Plus, the service was nonexistent. 

The only good part of the meal was the hostess. She was warm, friendly, and kind. 

I expect to get gouged on the Strip, but not like this. We won't be back.
