One star solely for the margarita. Service gets 0 stars, food gets 0 stars. 

UGH, what a frustrating experience! We came here with a craving for margaritas and nachos. Ended up ordering a strawberry margarita pitcher, which was delicious. The nachos were almost inedible. The chicken on them did not taste fresh and they used a cheese sauce reminiscent of Taco Bell's, but at least Taco Bell's is good... This one just tasted off. There was also shredded cheese that wasn't even melted! Very gross.

Service was incredibly poor. We ordered food, so maybe we should get plates and silverware? Nope! Didn't get any of that. I tried getting the waitress's attention to ask for it, but she was notttt available. Meanwhile, I took some napkins from the bar. When I finally did get to ask for these basic dining necessities she never brought us anything... So then I asked some random guy answering phones and he brought out 4 plates. BUT WHAT ABOUT THE SILVERWARE. Had to ask him AGAIN. And by then a fly landed on the nachos so there's that.
