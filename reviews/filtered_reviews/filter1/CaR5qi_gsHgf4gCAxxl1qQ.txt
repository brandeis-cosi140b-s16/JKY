Was there for St Patty's day early dinner, Nachos were terrible! Mexican restaurant and terrible nachos ??...doesn't make sense! Was empty on drinks several times, had to ask for everything, didn't know the waitresses name, enchilada sauce was yuk compared to most Mexican food places. My guess is that theryre only succeeding cuz of the location, rather than the referrals and good food.... Too bad. Won't go there again or will I refer !
