Sonrisa? No Bueno people. What a complete disappointment. After reading the reviews, I was looking forward to eating some good Mexican food. 

I ordered a very basic meal in my opinion....tacos...two chicken and one carne asada. Upon receiving the tacos, I laughed out loud to myself!!!! Lol, the meat was dry (chicken and beef) and was topped with lettuce, tomatoes and cold shredded cheese. The rice and beans were dry. They tasted processed out of a can :-( ugggh

TERRIBLE!!!!! Nothing authentic about this joint. The menu items are overpriced. Waste of time and money. On a positive note, they play very good music. But, tell me....how can the music be better than the food???

Last thing, I ordered guacamole for an appetizer.  $7.00 for a scoop that wasn't freshly made. I guess I'm used to Lindo Michoacan...
