Sadly enough I actually have to give my used to be favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas a 1 star rating. I have been going to Mercado's for years, even at the old location on Rainbow (which I must say was WAY better than the new one). Ate here last night. First off, the server, Alfredo was very unfriendly and rude. My order of plain cheese enchiladas was wrong because I asked for green sauce instead of red. He grabbed the plate off the table and acted disgusted that I wouldn't eat what was given to me, wrong order or right order. The rice was cold and hard. I was not trying to chip a tooth! The salt on the margarita was slim pickings and whatever salt was on there fell off on the table as soon as the waiter slide it on the table. Next when we got our bill, the prices were higher and different than the ones on the menu. I would like to point out that both of our menus reflected these prices: The combo plates showed as 9.95, 12.95, 14.95 on our menu and I noticed the Brunch price was 14.95. When we brought this to Alfredo's attention he basically called us liars and then went to the register to grab menus to prove to us that he was right. I could see him fumbling through menus to find the ones with the prices that we were charged and higher. What I am thinking was they updated their menus with new pricing and maybe gave us an older menu. The menu he brought over showed the combo plates at being 12.95, 15.95 and 17.95 and the brunch at 15.95. He then proceeded to tell us that the menus were never updated or that the prices had never been increased. 

It's not about the 1-item combo plate being 12.95 versus 9.95 on our menu, but the fact that they basically called us liars. I know what I saw on the menu and I am not blind. Talked to the manager, I think that's who he is and all he says, "well I'll have to find those menus!" Are you kidding me? Bad customer service. Our entire family will never eat here again because of the service.
