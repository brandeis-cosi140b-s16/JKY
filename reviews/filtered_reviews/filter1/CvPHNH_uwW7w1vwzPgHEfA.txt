My husband and I have been going to Sylvia's for some time now.  We went there on Friday, 4/19/13 and had the worst service we have ever experienced.  We sat at a table on the patio for 20 minutes without anyone ever acknowledging us or taking an order.  We finally went in and ordered two beers since no one seemed interested in us.  The menu stated they had Budweiser and BudLight on draft for $3.00.  However when the beers were ordered, we were told the menu was wrong and they only had BudLight in bottles for $4.00 each.  Not cool.  The patio, while outside, is pretty enclosed.  A nearby patron was smoking an incredibly strong brand of cigarettes and the smoke and stench was just about killing us.  There should be ceiling fans going at all times to keep the air moving.  The whole experience was ridiculous.  We won't be back.  Sorry Sylvia's, but you failed miserably.
