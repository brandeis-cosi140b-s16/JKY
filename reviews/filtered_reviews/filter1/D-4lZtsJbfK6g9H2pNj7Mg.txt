Its pretty hard to mess up mexican food, but Carlos and Charlies managed to do it.  We ordered and appetizer of guacamole.  However the meal arrived before the appetizer did, so we sent it back and asked for the appetizer to be serve.  The guacamole was actually pretty good.  However it appears that they just took our entrees that they served us before the appetizer and just warmed them back up after 20 minutes.   The ceasars salad was sooggy and the chicken quesidilla was just plain old.   The food is overpriced to begin with so thank god we had a groupon.   If you want a great mexican dinner at a reasonable price go to Mi Casa in the Silverton Hotel!!
