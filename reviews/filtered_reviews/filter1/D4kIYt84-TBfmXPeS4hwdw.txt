This review is based on 2 visits.  Went in today hoping to take advantage of the happy hour deal that I had tried a few months back. Since I had kids with me, they allowed us to sit in the dining room, which sits next to the bar. Food was mighty good, service was ok.  Waitress was non existent for most of the time we were there, but the food made up for that.  THAT was then, THIS is now.  I was told today that I wouldn't be able to sit in a booth adjacent to the bar for their happy hour deal.  The waitress asked 2 managers, but they would not accommodate us.  I can understand if the restaurant were busy, but it was a ghost town.  4 adults that were planning to order plentiful drinks AND food was not a good enough reason for management to bend the rules, to their favor.  This time, the server was nice, chips were good, but management dropped the ball.  Ended up walking out.  Drove out to Phat Franks clear across town for some grub. Glad we did.
