We are regulars of the Mesa location, always enjoy it. This visit on Central was really disappointing. Party of four stopped last night, the margaritas were great. Both the red and green salsas were really salty, all four commented on that. I thought it may be the chips, it was the salsa. Usually, out of town guests comment on the heat, but the salt was the noticeable flavor. Wife had a chicken burrito. Bite one yielded a bone and lots of water. Not to be confused with juice, it was water. My green chili dinner was mediocre. The beef chunks were large and the chili had not flavored the meat. The meat had been put on the plate, green chili poured over the top. The meat was dry. nothing comparable to the green chili I have had at other locations. Diner three loved the ribs. Diner four ate the flautas, but said they were bland. Typically in Mesa, people love the food and comment on the heat. In this case one loved his ribs, all loved the margaritas. Maybe we hit on a bad night, but most of the passion I have for their hot food was not fulfilled. These salsas were overwhelming with salt, all four of us commented immediately. We are pretty easy to please, have been eating at Ls Dos for years. We will go back to Mesa, but not this location. There were too many negatives, not much on the plus side.
