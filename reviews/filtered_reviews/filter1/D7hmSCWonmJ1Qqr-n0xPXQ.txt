I not sure what is worse.  Bad service, or no service at all. However,  taking a look at all the other reviews it seem the vast majority of complaints about this place. All revolve around their bad service, or lack thereof anything resembling service.

Today, when I arrived with a group for a business meeting, we found ourselves waiting for a long time for anyone to come over, we eventually had to flag someone over to us.

The kicker was, we had to do it many times before the "hostess" (don't say waitress,  it seems they get offended by it) came over.

Once there, she lied to us. Saying, that we needed to wait to get seated, and that the place we had decided to seat our ourselves at, is a $200 reserved table. Yeah, I did not buy that. Especially seeing that this place is not exactly a high end restaurant and the table was located outside in the baking Sun.

My boss decided what the hell, he will pay the $200 and it should not be a issue, since nobody is using this table anyway. Instead of accepting the money, the awful and very rude waitress... Sorry I mean hostess, made it clear she's not accepting our money and walked away. And there we sat.

After, a few minutes we decided we're just gonna leave, seeing that we're not getting any service. 

However, before we did, my boss and a fellow co worker went to talk with the manager and found out, that they do not reserve those tables and that we are allowed to see ourselves wherever we want.

I can only assume she had some kind of personal issue with us. 

Anyway - The damage was done .
