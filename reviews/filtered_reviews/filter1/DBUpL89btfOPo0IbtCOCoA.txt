Heard great things from the concierge at the hotel I'm staying at.  Extremely disappointed...  The "hot sauce" taste like a can of tomato sauce with a packet of McCormick taco spice thrown in it.  The food is so bland it reminded me the "Mexican food" I get when I visit my 96 year old grandmother at the waiting to die home.   There are so many better places in Vegas, believe me!
