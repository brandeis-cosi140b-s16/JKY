The service was bad, there was no food quality check. We ordered a lettuce and tomato taco, wait, I mean a chicken taco, but there was hardly any chicken. Also ordered the nacho's, the sour cream was M.I.A. My water was never refilled. The waitress dropped off the check. I immediately put my card in, and she made several passes before we had to stop her and ask her to take the check. Not at all impressed, will not be back.
