Definitely won't be back. My friend and I had the steak burrito and another friend the chicken. Steak tasted like it could've came from a can (not that it did bit could've lol). 

Paid $1.25 for a little teeny thing of sour cream (takeout order). $21 total for 2 steak burritos,  fries and sour cream. Had I known before we got back home I definitely would not have put that on my tab. 

Fries we're greasy...they looked burnt but didn't taste like it. My friend with the chicken burrito enjoyed it. All meals came with chips and another teeny thing of Pico de Gallo. I was so hungry I ate half of the burritto and then stopped....it was pretty bad. Granted we got there a half hour before they closed but that shouldn't be an excuse :(
