YUCK! Craving Mexican food so my friend and I decided to stop at this place for some burritos. We were impressed with the large selection at the salsa bar. When we got our stale store-bought, rubbery chips the salsa wasn't so appealing after all. We both ordered chicken burritos and were shocked when we got a basket with a tortilla filled with soggy chicken bits and bean soup. It wasn't possible to use a fork and knife in a basket so we tried to pick them up and the burritos spilled all over our hands. It was a mess! I asked the waitress to look at the menu again because we were not satisfied with the burritos. I hate to waste food but we could not force ourselves to eat them. She said we had to pay for the burritos and then she would give us "one" taco. She made us feel very uncomfortable as she waved her "one" finger in our faces so I told her we would pay for the food and then look at the menu again. She immediately brought me the check and waited over my shoulder for me to pay for it before she handed us the menus. Her angry attitude scared us, so we no longer wanted to look at the menu. We just wanted to leave and try out another restaurant. I would not recommend dining at this place. The quality of food was horrible and the service was even worse. Waitress with vile attitude and crappy food equals a no win situation. You're better off dining at Taco Bell.
