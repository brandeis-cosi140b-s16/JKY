I don't really see why I should choose this place over Del Taco or Taco Bell to be honest (let alone Chipotle or Fillie's). The staff would be the same (maybe better) and I'd get more food for almost the same quality. Watch out with their Taco Tuesday special. $1.75 for a small soft taco. If you get the "tacos", don't take the beans and rice or drink when they offer it or the special no longer applies and it jumps up to $6-$8 they don't let you know till you get to the register where they offer you a drink for a few dollars more like what happened with me. Leaves a bad taste in the mouth. But I went back anyway, not to be fooled again only to find out you can only get a limited amount of ingredients in the tacos for the special to apply. I don't think I could even get cheese on it. So I said whatever, paid my money and sat down to eat my limited tacos w/ no drink and suddenly the dining area seemed a little darker, the music a little louder and more irritating, and other diners with the same butt hurt looks on their face I probably had, and probably thinking, "Why in the world did I come here?" too.

Caf√© Rio gets one star in my book for having a misleading/unclear menu, unhelpful and unfriendly employees, nickel and diming approach guised as specials, overcharging for small portions of food with limited ingredients, and charging extra for things that come standard every where else. Literally, the only positive I can say for this place is that some of the ingredients are fresh, but in the face of all those other factors and my experiences there it doesn't really matter and I won't be back. If I'm going to have Mexican food I'll just go to one of the other 6 or so Mexican places that come readily to mind, not to mention the other local, less marketed restaurants that I use yelp to find that that eclipse this place with their better service, food, prices, and atmosphere. For all those reasons, going here is just unthinkable to me.
