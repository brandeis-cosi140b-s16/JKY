This place was horrible! Went in for dinner, place was about half full, if that... Should have been a warning sign... Took more than 20 minutes to get a drink order in. Over 30 minutes to get some chips. Chips came, and the server had dropped off a load of beer for another table at the same time as getting out chips. He had manages to get the run off from the beer all over the chips. Didn't notice it till we were like wonder why the wet!?! Gross! Food came about 45 minutes later, it was nasty... Dry, flavor-less, and my stomach was all messed up after this place. Wonder why... 

Save your money, don't go here. Everything from the food to the service is a joke...
