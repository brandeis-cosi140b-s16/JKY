Dibs on all the tv's during their impending liquidation sale! This place was so bad I was actually embarrassed for them. The food was so not good, the silverware was dirty and service was bad. I had read so many bad reviews but I went anyway because I liked their name. 
I originally thought  "How can you f#$ up nachos? "
You make them Tex-Mex style that's how. I can't stand Tex-Mex, way too much corn on everything. Gross. Regardless of their style they were flavorless and nasty, I had to smear sour cream and Tapatio over every bite to get them down.
