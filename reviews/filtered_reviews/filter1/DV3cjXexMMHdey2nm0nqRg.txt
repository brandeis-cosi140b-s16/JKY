I have never been treated so rudely at a restaurant in my life.  After calling and making a reservation for 20 people on a Sunday night, when we arrived they were not prepared.  Half the restaurant was empty, but they made it sound like they were doing US a huge favor by accommodating the large party.

Service was very, very slow.  The overcharged us on the bill, and when we questioned them on it the manger came over and argued with us for over 10 minutes stating we were wrong.  The food was overpriced, small portion, and for mexian really didn't have much flavor.  Only redeeming aspect was their guacamole dip.

The real kicker was once we were finally done, it took them over 45 minutes to run our credit cards after we figured out the bill.  We sat there waiting, after all the food was cleared, with no drinks while our waiter was in the back I guess doing something.  We only gave him 5 cards total, with very specific names and amounts so it should have been easy to follow.  

What a mess, next time I'm in Vegas I'll make the walk to Mandalay Bay where there is some true Mexican!
