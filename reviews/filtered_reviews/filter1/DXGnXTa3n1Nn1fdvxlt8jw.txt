Food is average.
Service is terrible.

We tried this place a few weeks ago and will not be returning again. It took several minutes before anyone even greeted us at the host stand. I believe it was the manager that finally came and acknowledged us. He quickly looked for an open table and mentioned one open towards the back of the restaurant. He didn't even walk us to the table and instead chatted with another table before coming over and handing us the menu. 5 minutes go by, 10 minutes, almost 15 minutes later we finally asked a waiter if someone could take our order. Maybe we were forgotten since we were in the back, idk. Not sure why we didnt just walk out. He mentioned that our waitress was bringing us our chips and salsa and would take our order soon. She finally comes 2 minutes later and takes our order. We haven't even gotten water at this point.  They bring our food (chicken soup and 2 tacos) within a reasonable time after we order but I'm so hungry from all the waiting that I nearly finish the big basket of chips and salsa. Boo. 

The soup was okay. It came in a cauldron-like bowl that is NOT ideal for soup. I had to bend the spoon for more convenience. The tacos were again average. Nothing special. If you want gourmet tacos, go to El Hefe on Mill. Our drinks were not refilled until after we finished our food. None of our dishes were taken away from our tiny table. Crappy service the entire night.
