Don't go on Taco Tuesday.  Stood in line for 15 minutes and then waited 30 minutes for our order.  They couldn't handle the volume and were more focused on the phone orders (you could see the orders piling up on the back counter) than the 15 customers standing in front of them waiting for their food.
