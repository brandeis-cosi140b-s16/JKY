came here on Saturday 8/2/14 afternoon for some lunch, it was a party of 9 of us. The pace was pretty empty. We were sat and waters were brought, our drink order was taken and they came about 15 minutes later...much too long for the place being empty. A few of our party arrived about 15 minutes after our drinks arrived ($14 for a tiny little mixed drink...ridiculous) and our server had still not gotten back to take our food order or the new arrivals drink order.  We ordered a few appetizers, thank goodness, because our food did not come for another 30 minutes. Our server was kind of a jerk and did not come and check on us. The manager came over one time but all she did was take more drink orders, did not apologize for the long wait or the horrible service. We ordered chips and salsa but the salsa was way too spicy even for me to eat and I love spicy food. The next time we saw the server we had to ask for our bill, we paid with a couple of cards and the rest cash. The server NEVER brought us our change back, by that time we were so fed up we just wanted to leave. I give this place 2 stars only because the ambiance and d√©cor was very nice. The food was not even good the enchiladas were more like 4 mini tacos with sauce on them (it was $18 by the way)....my friends couldn't even eat their salads. Would never recommend this place.
