We went here thinking the food would be the same as one at the Squaw Peak Pointe. It's not. Different owners I found out when I was there. The food was horrible. Honesty, I would have enjoyed Taco Bell more. There was nothing authentic about the Mexican food served here. It tasted like it came out of a can. The other Aunt Chilada's is far superior. Go there.
