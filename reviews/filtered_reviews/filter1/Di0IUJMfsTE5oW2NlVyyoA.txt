I used to love this place  and come every Sunday with large group of people but lately the bouncers at the door  holds the  line for no reason. Last Sunday While the place was 1/3 full I had to wait in line for 30 minutes. However the door guy let about 50 people whom he didn't bother to check IDs because he knew them. This attitude needs to change and everyone should be respected. If we have to pay to get in the. Post a cover charge I would gladly pay that 5 or 10 dollar at the door than bribing your door guy. Last time I check bribing was against the law. Hire new door guys who is not associated with same douchy Scottsdale crowd so everyone get a chance to experience this place. Customer service starts at the door el Hefe management team not at the table. Till then I will take my money somewhere else...
