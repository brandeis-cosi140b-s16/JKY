Tell you what, pictures do lie! That was the worst Mexican food I think I ever had. I ordered a chicken nacho fajita with grilled onions and bell peppers. First off when I got my food, it was huge and packed with chips and no chicken. It was only about 3 bites. The bell peppers and onions were raw and was not cooked at all. So they took it back and cooked them for me and they were still raw. I ordered shrimp with my order as well, and I had to flag down the waiter to let him know I didn't have any on there, and that's when he decided to tell me that that don't carry shrimp any more. That place was horrible and I would never go back because of the food. That place just looks like its good but it's not. Look are always deceiving.
