I used to enjoy coming to this place but my experience this past weekend prompted me to sign up for Yelp and write this review.  When I came here a few weeks ago, I figured the horrible service was a fluke but the "too cool to notice you" staff this weekend confirmed the disappointing turn in customer service.

Here are the "highlights" of the night:

1.  Picked up friends from the airport and arrived at Gallo Blanco before 10pm.
2.  Asked for a table for 5 and were told that the wait would be 15-20 minutes, which was not a problem for us.
3.  10:20pm:  decided to change the party number to 4 since one friend wasn't able to make it anymore.
4.  Seated a few minutes later to a dining room and patio at 40% capacity.  Really?!?
5.  Menus and water brought to the table.
6.  10:30-10:35pm:  Staff consistently ignored my fiancé, who was trying to track down our server since we were ready to order.  During this time, we saw other tables being tended to and waited on.
7.  Walked out of the restaurant.  The hostess, servers, and other staff failed to notice or say anything as we left.

 It's understandable if the restaurant was busy but the dining room was practically empty at the time my fiancé was trying to get someone's attention.  Maybe it's because we're Asian but I guess the staff felt we didn't deserve the attention they gave to the other cool, hipster people there that night.  I felt awful for bringing my friends here and wasting their precious time on their quick trip to Phoenix.  Thanks Gallo Blanco for wasting an hour of my life.  Your food is not good enough to deserve a repeat visit.
