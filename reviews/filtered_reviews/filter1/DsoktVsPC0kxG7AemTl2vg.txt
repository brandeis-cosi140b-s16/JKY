Let me just start with the Café Rio on Eastern is the best with the nicest employees. 
The last two times that I have been to the Blue Diamond location I have had a horrible experience. 
The first time the cashier was extremely rude to me, she was unhappy that I was paying with my Café Rio points from my catering order. That is no reason to be rude to anyone. No thank you, no nothing. This is your job, if she is so unhappy she should just quit. 
The second time I stopped in I was close to this location so I decided to stop in during the lunch hour. It was a little busy but I was patient. I ordered a salad and I told the person no Pico, and I had to yell it over the glass and she was still was not listening to me because I had to say it numerous times. When she finally heard me it was too late and she he started to scoop off the Pico, then looked at me and in a very rude manner she asked "do you want me to make you another?" She was so rude but I said no, that's okay. She obviously did not want to. I checked out and I was so surprised that she was so rude, when it was her fault that she wasn't listening to what I wanted. She should have just made me another without asking. I headed back to the office to eat my salad, I picked the remaining tomatoes out and to my surprise I found a BUG on my lettuce. 
Well I wasn't going to eat the salad now that it had a bug in it. That was the last time that I will ever go to this location. This one is close to my house, and close to my job but I am willing to drive all the way to Eastern if I want Café Rio.
