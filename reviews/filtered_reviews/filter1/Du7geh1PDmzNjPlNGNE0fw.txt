Was invited to join a group of friends for a 4 foot Burrito meal for 10, which was given as a promotion. What a mistake!

The burrito was served on a large cutting board ( the best part of the meal) As for the filling, which was SUPPOSED to be beef/chicken, it was primarily rice and beans. 
If paying full price($50) one would be very upset. 

The salsa and chips was $5 per small bowl, the red salsa was flat and tasteless, the salsa verde was not much better.

Drinks were expensive, $7 draught beers. Happy hour was 2 for 1 which was a reasonable price.

The decor was very interesting, even entertaining.

As we left, I tried to comment to the manager about the lack of meat in the 4' Burrito, He tried to get me to believe there was 42 oz of meat in it. No way!

The promotion seems to be a ploy to have a party of ten buy the obligatory drinks in a desperate attempt to keep this place open. Don't bother. There are many other places nearby with better beer selections and way better food. 

The staff was very friendly but slow. Maybe that was the laidback beach atmosphere they were trying to create. My advice for them would be to dress up their resumes.
