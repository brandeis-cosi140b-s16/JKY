The tacos are to expensive $4.45 ... they used the worst corn tortilla .. u can find in any store .. Guerrero .a process .. horrible smell. 
I was hopping to find a better and authentic mexican street taco .. with a homemade tortilla .. for the price ..
Don't used sour cream to taco .. that's Taco bell...
The asada beef has a good flavor and very tender.. they have a good customer service ... employees very nice..and helpful. 

I hope u guys can improve your tacos..
