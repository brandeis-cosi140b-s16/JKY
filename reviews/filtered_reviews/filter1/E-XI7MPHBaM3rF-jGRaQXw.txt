Ok, if I could give 0 stars I would.  My boyfriend and I had heard really great things about this place and it was the most disappointing dining experience we have had.

We were greeted friendly and the atmosphere is nice and there's plenty of TVs if you're into sports and that's where the good ends.  It took 10-15 minutes to get our drinks after we ordered.  Another 15 minutes later our order was finally taken.  We tried asking our server for recommendations and he seemed confused.  After we ordered out appetizer they kept bringing us appetizers that weren't ours and we had to keep reminding them what we ordered.  Then after 30 minutes of sitting there a random plate of chips and salsa were dropped off.  We again thought this was a mistake since complimentary chips and salsa do not take 30 minutes.  

Our service varied from server to buser and neither seemed to have a clue what was going on or what was in the dishes.  It seemed like it was their first day open and not they had been open for months or that you would even know they owned other businesses.  When we did finally get our food the tacos were salty and lacked any other flavor with maybe a teaspoon of meat in them and the ceviche looked worse than something my cat vomited up to be quite blunt and honest.  Just isn't a better to describe that - it definitely was not fresh.  And after their other business has had food scandals with the media you would think they would have this figured out.

The worst part was watching the one gentleman who greeted us bust his butt around the place while the owner walked around aimlessly and his wife was only concerned with chatting with one table of their friends and walked by not only us by several other patrons multiple times without even asking if the food was ok or anything at all.

Terrible food, terrible service.  Sad - I wanted it to be good.
