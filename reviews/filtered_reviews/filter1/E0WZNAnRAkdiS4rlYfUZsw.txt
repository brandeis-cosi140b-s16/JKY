We are huge fans of this place. But I think the one on Camelback is the best location. 

Last time we ate here the service was terrible and you could tell it was completely understaffed for a Sunday morning. My wife ordered a bloody Mary that was horrible and didn't have more than two sips. And on top of it all of our orders came out wrong.

Lastly, you could tell the staff was working their butts off and the manager on duty was standing around watching. In fact I saw someone dropped a fork on the floor and he stepped over it 4xs until the lady in a clown suit entertaining kids picked it up.

So for the price and what we got it was a waste of time and money!
