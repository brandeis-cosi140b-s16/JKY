Not all burritos are created equal, but Someburritos is just "plain" nasty. 

I thought the idea behind the burrito was more than just meet in a tortilla, which makes this a literally PLAIN burrito. if i wanted a large taco, i would have ordered a large taco. the taste was bland at best, their hot sauce is more of a tomato sauce than anything else. 

 I probably should have read some reviews before ordering. Everything including salsa costs extra... I literally walked out without eating. Service was what you would expect from a burrito joint, nothing stellar.
