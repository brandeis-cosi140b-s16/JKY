The management here is messed up. We came on fourth of july and there was a line out the door. As we got closer to the counter to order, i finally realized why the line was out the door. One person is preparing our orders while 6 others are standing around, talking, acting like their busy but they're not. They act like they're only assigned to one job (i.e. cashier) so they stick to that one job post even when there's no one to help while one lady is running around putting tortillas on the grill, flipping them, putting the meat and fillings in it and assembling it. When one girl tried to tip her, another worker came up and said that's not allowed. What do you mean it's not allowed? They probably split tip if we had left it in the tip jar. Heck, we only want to tip the person who actually worked.
