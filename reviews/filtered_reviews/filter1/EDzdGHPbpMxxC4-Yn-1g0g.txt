It was my first time and will be my last visit. I don't know where and how this place got 4.5 stars from yelpers. There were 8 of us dined in tonight. We got separate bill and 20% tip was added to each bill. 

My friends ordered chimichanga, burrito, kimchi fried rice, and pork sliders. I was the only one ordered pan fried fish. I asked if the they deep fried or breaded. The waitress told me they grilled the fish. What? But I'm an adventurous food lover, so I went ahead and gave it a chance anyway. What a disappointment! My dish was the last to came out. The fish fillet was cold, bland, soggy, and felt apart as soon as I touched it with the fork, so I asked for a chopsticks instead. The vegetables, mostly broccoli, with few pieces of onion, and green bell pepper were also tasteless. I couldn't tell if they were grilled or pan fried. Standard Korean sticky rice came with it, nothing special. I barely eaten my food. Most of my friends didn't finish their neither. 

I was going to get the Calypso Lemonade, but decided to skip it after how disappointed my food was. 

My advice: spend your money elsewhere. This place doesn't worth the drive up to North Las Vegas.
