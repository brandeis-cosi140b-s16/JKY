For a place that has the word "burrito" in the name, you'd think the burritos were actually tasty....not the case.  However, I must preface this review by saying I've only tried one burrito here.

I was crunched for time at the airport, hungry and 360 Gourmet Burrito was literally next to my gate.  I originally wanted the rice, bean & cheese burrito, but was told they were out of beans. Hmmm, really? A burrito place that's out of beans pretty early in the afternoon? Ok.  So, I decided to be adventurous and try the Thai Burrito.  It was carrots, jasmine rice & spicy peanut sauce with my choice of protein (I opted for tofu).  It also had grilled peppers and onions.

After paying $12 for a burrito and a drink, I was optimistic that it would be a nice taste-bud deviation from the standard burrito.  After one bite, I was HUGELY disappointed! The entire burrito was completely overwhelmed with the sauce, which didn't taste a thing like peanuts, but a lot like crushed red pepper. You couldn't appreciate any of the flavors of the other ingredients.  Truly a let down.  I managed 3 bites because I was really trying to like it, but it didn't happen.  It ended up in the garbage and I got on my plane still hungry.

 In my experience, anytime the word "gourmet" is used in a restaurant name or to describe a food item, run fast and run hard! I just want food.  Food that is tasty and food that satisfies.  Next time I'm at the Vegas airport, I'll seek out other food options, this place is not getting my business again!
