The service was ABSOLUTELY, HANDS DOWN, THE WORST I have ever experienced! The menu had about five things on it. Not good for breakfast. The food  items that we ordered was the fruit and yogurt, eggs and hash browns. They were both revolting! My wife spat the food back onto the plate. The neighboring table next to us agreed with the problem with the lack of good food let alone food. They had no bagels or toast because of no toaster. They had eggs and hash browns and the yogurt with the fruit I mentioned before. Although it is Sammy's restaurant, he should NOT be playing his loud, overbearing music especially in the mornings. Do not eat here. Anywhere else in the airport is better than this.
