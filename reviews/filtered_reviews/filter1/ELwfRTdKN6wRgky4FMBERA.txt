We used to go here often. They used to have the patio open for breakfast, and we could bring our two kids, and they LOVED sitting outside. Now, the patio isn't open. In fact, we have been there for dinner, and the patio has been closed. They always seem like they are short staffed, and just don't want to have anyone wait the tables outside. The patio is the best thing about this place, so without that.... eh. 
The food is okay. It's not horrible, but nothing to write home about. 
We used to get seated right away (about a year ago) and now there's been a wait every single time.... The place is never packed, again--- just not enough staff. 
We have given it several shots since it's so close to home and you used to be able to get in and out quickly.
The final straw was when we went for dinner a few weeks ago, and we didn't get our drinks til our food came, about 15 mins after ordering. The waitress apologized that they were out of cups. WHAT!? Out of cups. They 'have a large party' in the back and there are no cups left. 
Ridiculous. So we sat there eating chips and salsa, with no water. 
Not a well ran restaurant. I told my husband we have given it enough tries. We won't be back!
