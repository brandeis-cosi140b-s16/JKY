We went here last night with some friends that love this place. I am a big time Mexican food snob. I like mine authentic and spicy. This place is anything but authentic. Let's start with the salsa, the red salsa was about the only good thing therg, the green salsa was sweet, I can see some salsas being a litte sweet but this stuff was sickly sweet, not so good. Then I ordered the chimichanga with green chile pork. The fried tortilla was the only good thing on my plate. The meat inside was super dry and again it was sweet, not a good thing in my eyes. If I want sweet food I would have some cake or some St. Louis BBQ. I don't even think it was the green chile pork. The beans had too much of a smoky flavor, I could see if it was more of a smoky bacon or pork flavor but it didn't. 

The only good thing that night was the waiter. He was great. If you want great Mexican food this is not the place, go to someplace like Los Taquitos
