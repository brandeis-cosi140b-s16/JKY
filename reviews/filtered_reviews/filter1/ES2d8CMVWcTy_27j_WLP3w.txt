Never eating here again! I love Mexican food but this place here sucks! It's overpriced and the three or four salsas they put on your table are awful, I couldn't even eat it I ended up getting my money back. This place gets more business than it should, they don't have anything on the Pollo Mobile on the corner of Smoke Ranch.
