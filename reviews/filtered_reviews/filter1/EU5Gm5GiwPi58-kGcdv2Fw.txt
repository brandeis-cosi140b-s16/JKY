Food was edible but tiny portions for such high prices. My sister and i arrived our server was friendly at first we started with a pitcher of beer and then a couple appetizers an order of guacamole, the shrimp ceviche and the carne asada quesadilla. When we only ordered appetizers our server seemed a little annoyed. The guac was tasty while i only took a bite of my quesadilla since it was oozing grease and my sis liked the ceviche but it looked so different from most ceviche. Now back to the server i wanted to split the cost down the middle i used a card my sister used cash, i wanted to leave the tip on my card so he comes back and asked if we needed the change i said yes and he became such a sourpuss! He handed us $10 cash back assuming since we asked for change we were going to leave him a crappy tip.  I was shocked at his blatant annoyance, i still tipped him 17% even though we were super easy and laid back, what a jerk! One place I won't return.
