My business associates and I just returned from working at a convention in Las Vegas at the Mandalay Bay resort, and decided to go to a Mexican restaurant this past Friday evening at around 7:30 PM.

We decided to go to Diablo's Cantina since we've eaten there before and remembered our last experience there as being relatively pleasant.

This time we were promptly seated at a table, and were each handed menus.

The sound system was playing music at such a high volume level that we couldn't speak to one another without yelling very loudly (not to mention that the sound system was terrible, and the music was also highly distorted).  

After sitting in this situation for approximately seven minutes, we decided that this was unbearable and left for a different restaurant (Gonzalez Y Gonzalez) which is located inside the New York, New York casino.

Gonzalez Y Gonzalez turned out to be quite good, reasonably quiet, and exactly what we were hoping for.  

We've been to Las Vegas approximately ten times within the past five years, and we will likely never return to Diablo's Cantina.
