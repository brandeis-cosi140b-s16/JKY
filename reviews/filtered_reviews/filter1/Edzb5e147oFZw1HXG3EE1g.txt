Shame on me I was fooled twice in a moment of hunger and desperation. Just eat a snack bar and save yourself the money. First time I went I had their veggie tacos which were soggy street tacos w/ cold gross pickled red onions and cold corn that tasted like water. I was hungry and had 2 hours to spare so I gave in again! OMG what a waste of money. I tried to "make" a salad for a vegetarian by modifying a few things but they don't have black beans so mostly I had cold ice berg lettuce, cold cold roasted corn and tomatoes that were frozen at some point so as to taste like cold water slush cubes. All their salsa but their spicy salsa tastes like water. They charged $2.49 for what amounted to 1.5 TBL of "guacamole" which tasted like smooched avocados with no flavor or texture. I think I deserve what I got going to this place twice, boy do I feel like an idiot.
