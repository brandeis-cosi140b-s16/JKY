I've been here many times for dinner and it's been good.  However today I took my husband and friend to try the brunch.  I was very disappointed!   My husband ordered the huevos rancheros it was one corn tortilla heated with 2 eggs on top.  Awful!  My friend and I ordered chorizo and egg with potatoes. The chorizo and potatoes were black from being burnt!!  Rather than scramble eggs into chorizo the eggs were just separate.  It was the worst breakfast we've had!   The bloody mary was watered down.  Very disappointed,  will not be back.  The wait for our food was almost 30 minutes.
