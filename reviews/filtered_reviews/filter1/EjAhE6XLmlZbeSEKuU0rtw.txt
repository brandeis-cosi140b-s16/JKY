On August 1, 2014 I took my aging in laws for a 7:30 pm dinner.  We arrived on time and were seated toward the back on the restaurant.  About half way thru the meal the manager lead a large group of party goers to four hastily pushed together tables. Not an unusual event for Vegas. The problem however was that the first wave of customers was followed more waves of loud intoxicated foul mouthed folks who were just left to mill around to piss and moan about not having a place to sit. The management had no answer and the mini mob stood about for over half an hour.  Our table was soon eyeballed as part of the solution to managements problem and we were aggressively serviced by table cleaning bus help who hovered close by.

This is not a first class restaurant it is a poorly managed over priced fast food operation.  No control on the seating process and expect to be treated like a credit card transaction not a valued customer.
