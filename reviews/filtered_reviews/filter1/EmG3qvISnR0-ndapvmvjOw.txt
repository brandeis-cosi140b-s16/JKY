Bad service.  Went for lunch on cinco de mayo.  Saw there were specials, prizes, balloons...but our waitress never mentionned any of the specials.  We found out only after placing our order.  We were offered a free tamale because it was our first visit.  They forgot to bring it out.  Got it when the meal was almost finished then they charged it on the bill.  The waitress barely came to our table so no way to refill drinks or get extra napkins.  Food was mediocre. I am dissapointed because judging by the crowds I've seen there I expected excellent food and excellent service, neither of which we got.
