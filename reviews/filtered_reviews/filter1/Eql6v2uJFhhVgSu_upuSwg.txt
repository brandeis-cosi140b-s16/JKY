Went in on Halloween day with my husband and got so extremely sick within an hour of leaving.  Had a burrito bowl with salsa and ended up with severe food poisoning.  Wanted to try this spot as I pass it all the time.  First red flag was an employee emptying container after container of store bought guacamole in a container to serve as their own.  Second red flag was the cleanliness of the salsa bar.  Bummer to miss Halloween but happy I'm alive.  Hopefully this was an isolated incident.  I definitely won't return....EVER!
