You cannot foo-foo up Mexican food and have it taste like real Mexican food.  How bout cheddar cheese on my chicken nachos instead of feta cheese.  Who eats crumbly cheese instead of melted cheese on nachos!?  I know for rich people, it either has to look like crap or taste like crap to be fashionable, but when I heard this was a really good Mexican food restaurant, that's what I expected.  They did nail the high end price though, $90 for 2 nasty dishes and $7 for a Corona.  If you want good Mexican food, don't go here, even Taco Bell would be better.  However the benefit is you are inside Mandalay Bay, so go play Blackjack after you throw up and you can win your money back that you wasted on this dump.
