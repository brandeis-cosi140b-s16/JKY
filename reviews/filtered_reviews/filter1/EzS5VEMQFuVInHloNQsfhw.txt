Lots of good recommendations but my shadow will not be cast on their door again. I ordered the combo which comes with 2 pcs of chicken and some beef tips, beans, salsa, onions and tortillas. ($9.00+) The 2 pieces of chicken were half of a hacked up back and 2/3 of a wing, THE TIP AND THE MIDDLE, NOT EVEN THE MEATY PART. There couldn't have been more than 3 ounces of chicken and it was drier than the Sahara. I was unable to get a bite down without a drink. The beef had good flavor but super dry also. The beans were standard fare and the salsa tasted like it was from a can. Overall, I felt ripped off
