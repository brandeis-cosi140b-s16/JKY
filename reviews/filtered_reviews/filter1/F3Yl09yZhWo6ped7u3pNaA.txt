I'm writing this review after my second (and last) visit. I'm from SF, so pardon me for expecting authentic street Mexican tacos & burritos. The first burrito I got from them was late at night on the way home from driving back from SF... perhaps it was close to closing time, so the reason the food was so salty and dry was because it was late and it had been sitting? The burrito was salty as hell, with no real freshness to any of the flavors. My second visit, I was on my way driving out to SF, around noon. I ordered a burrito again (easier to eat in the car). I ordered pork as the meat (which - btw the meat options for burritos are not clearly laid out on the menus - if you want a meat option they offer for the tacos, you have to look over at the taco line menus and specifically ask for it)... they offer "cilantro-style" rice (which - if I wanted that, I'd just patronize Chipotle) and Spanish style rice, and all the other standard burrito ingredients... but I'm pretty sure every single ingredient they have, rice, guac, pico, beans, meat, all have added salt in each. I could practically feel my skin shrivel in the desert dryness and my blood pressure rise to 180/90 about half way through my burrito. The worst part: the pork was so dehydrated and dead, they might as well have thrown shredded beef jerky in there and called it a day. Also, the burrito was pinner, and it was TEN BUCKS.
