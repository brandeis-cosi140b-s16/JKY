Okay food, terrible, slow and arrogant service.  You guys need to change your attitude.  The server could have cared less about her service, ignored, us and the food took forever! Not even an acknolwedgement from the staff that the food was taking too long. Also, we were sat down about 15 to 30 min after our seating time and there was not enough space for us to sit to wait for our table as there are only 4 chairs - 2 back to back so I had to sit on the edge as there were several of us. After asking to get a drink a waitress shoved a menu in my face and said she would take my order and never came around. We also had to chase our check down as well.
