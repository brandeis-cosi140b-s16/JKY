My friends and I visited China Poblano for my Birthday dinner. All in all, dinner left A LOT to be desired. We were all incredibly disappointed, and it put a damper on our evening. 

The Ceviche was probably the best dish. However, you have to order chips separately since it doesn't come with (a little weird). 

The dishes overall were just okay. Some of the flavors were good, but the portions were small. I ordered the lobster taco, which only had two small chunks of lobster. The tacos are tiny. My taco was only two small bites. $10 for that? My friends also ordered tacos, and were extremely dissatisfied. We were so unhappy that we asked for the tacos to be taken off our bill (which they did). 

The service was super slow. 

I would not come here again. It was a poor choice my birthday dinner. We were excited by the exotic menu and the fact that the restaurant is in the Cosmo Casino, but extremely disappointed in the end. Don't waste your time!
