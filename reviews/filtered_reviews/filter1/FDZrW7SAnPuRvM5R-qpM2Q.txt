I went here for dinner tonight as part of a work outing.  I ordered a cup of the pozole and the machaca plate.  The salsa was good.  The chips seem to have been salted six to seven times.  Not appealing.  The pozole was sweet.  When the waiter asked me how it was I was honest.  He told me said, "sweet?  I've never gotten that out of the pozole".  Nice people skills.  Try an apology or something nicer than basically saying I was wrong. The machaca was salty to the point of inedible.  The refried beans were extremely salty as well.  My coworkers complained of the same saltiness in their meals.  Their cook needs to learn how to season the food.  Or maybe taste it before you send it out.  I'm going back to San Diego tomorrow and I'm going to get some good pozole.  I would rather dumpster dive for food than eat here again.
