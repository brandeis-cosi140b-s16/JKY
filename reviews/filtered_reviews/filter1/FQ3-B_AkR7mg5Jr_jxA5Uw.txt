So my co worker and I looked at yelp while sitting at the table so we were already dedicated to our meal. We were greeted, sat, and attended to quickly.  Our waiter was great, watched him make guacamole at the tables, then our food came. I ordered the chilli colorado and she ordered a taco salad. The cook is amaizing as he figured out how to extract every bit of flavor from everything on my plate,  I could not even finish anything and I tried. This place has a great view,  but the food is horrible.  My co workers chicken on her taco salad tasted like they froze it, unthawed it, froze it again, un thawed it, scrubbed the toilet with it froze it and then cooked it untill it was as dry as he could get it, then he put it in one of the oiliest shells he could find. This was our first visit and on the way back to the office we stopoed at taco bell because we couldnt even finish our food.  At least the manager who didnt even come to the table gave our waiter permission to comp my meal. Needless to say I will never return to this establishment even if they are paying us to have a meal.
