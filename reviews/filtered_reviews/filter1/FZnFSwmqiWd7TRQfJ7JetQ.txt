Horrible Experience! The first time I came in there me and the bf didn't know what to order we wanted fish tacos we told the waitress, so we order this combo plate. 5 mins later our waitress tells us there is happy hour at 6 and fish tacos are one dollar. um you couldnt of told us to wait five mins? The soup I ordered had something metal in it, actually swallowed it! A small Soda was $2.50 little much since half of it was ice. Every time after that that I came I never had a good experience; food took forever, bad bad customer service. I gave up on this place!!
