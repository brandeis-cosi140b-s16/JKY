One of my favorite restaurants of all time but was very disappointed last night.  I have been going here for 10 years and have hosted numerous parties in their back room.  Would have said there isn't a better place to hang out on an afternoon anywhere.  Unfortunately, they have gone the micro brew route and don't carry Bud Light any longer.  Yes your youngsters like the micro brew but are they really the ones who spend money at your restaurant.  I certainly don't like the bartender looking down his nose at me because of what I request.  I did the micro brew thing and got it out of my system.  I want something I don't need to drink with a spoon so I can enjoy the food.  If I need to pair something I will do it with wine.  Still love the food but not without the cocktail I choose.  I will take my appetite, my wife's taste in wine, my taste in after dinner drinks, my friends and my company events (none of which are inexpensive) somewhere they stock what the masses drink.  And no, having Coors Light and Miller Light doesn't get us there.  The best quote from "The Millionaire Next Door" - I only drink two kinds of beer, Bud Light and Free and would gladly pay for Bud Light.  Remember who pays your bills folks.
