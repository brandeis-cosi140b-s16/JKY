Went to this restaurant on Cinco de Mayo, hoping to get some decent Mexican Food for lunch. Upon arrival and walking thru the front day I quickly became concern with the overall cleanliness of the restaurant. Once we ordered we got chips and Salsa.... (Chip and salsa bar was not well taken care of and the chip holder had very little chips in it and chips and salsa were all over front counter and floor. I could expect this if the place was slammed how ever it was minutes before noon and they were only a 1/4 full.
I ordered a carne asada burrito and I was very disappointed. The burrito was basically beans and very little meat. Not what anyone should expect from a carne asada burrito in Arizona.
My daughter ordered a taco and the grease was repulsive! We eat and left and the rest of the day was alla bout trying to digest awful food! Never again!
