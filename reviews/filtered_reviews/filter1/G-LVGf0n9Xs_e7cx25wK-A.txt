Party of twelve.. Birthday party. Reservations days out.

We get there and its two separate tables... This is a birthday party, not a adult table and a child table. Takes my peeps a while to get there. Once everyone gets there, we place our order all at the same time. The food comes out three plates at at time, over an hour and a half period. Food is not Mexican, not even a little. Food was basic AF. No spice, no flavor, and kinda cold. The food was all WAY expensive; all at LEAST $18 a plate. The furniture was blocky and quite uncomfortable, and the menus looked like they have NEVER been wiped down in their short lives. Never got a sorry from our waiter, but did get several from the acting manager; whoever that is... 

After all the ridiculousness we got 50% off the bill and some of us didn't even get our food. BTW The chips and salsa are NOT included w/ your meal. Do not WASTE your money at this place. We wanted to go to Yardhouse but they don't do reservations after 5. Terrible mistake; Chayo's.
