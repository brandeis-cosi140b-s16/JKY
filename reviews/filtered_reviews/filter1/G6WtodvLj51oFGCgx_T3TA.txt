So to celebrate Cinco de Mayo last night my wife and I were eager for a margarita. We decided would try Barrio Queen. We had been there before late at night and really liked it. We bring the kids, 14, 10, and 5. Okay that's a little risky but it's not a quiet place and my kids are pretty well behaved and they want to celebrate too. So it was an unusually perfect night out out and as we walked up at 6 pm there were lots of spots on the patio. We asked for a patio seat and we're told 30-45 minutes. Kind of a surprise but okay. So after 1:15 we are still waiting as party after party arrive well after us and fill up the patio. We finally said we would sit anywhere and eventually get seated at an indoor table. We get one of those tables down the main aisle with a booth bench on one side and chairs on the other. Not perfect for a family but whatever. Just got worse after that. Can't find our server, then can't get our drinks. Takes another 20 minutes just to finally get a margarita. Finally order. The food comes in bursts with some of us finished eating before other food arrives. Our table side guacamole appetizer gets served after we are all done eating our entrees. It was bizarre. Seemed deliberately kid UNFRIENDLY. Worst service I have had out in over 10 years and we eat out frequently.  To give you an idea, I have never written a negative review until now.  What a bummer.
