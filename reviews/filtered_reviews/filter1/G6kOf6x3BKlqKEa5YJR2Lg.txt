This is a really, really bad Mexican restaurant.  Forget the minor ten minute delay getting seated during a weekday afternoon.  Just remember the 45 minute wait for entrees after ordering them.  But it's a bar!  Drink up!  Well, maybe not.  My "plain" Margarita had ORANGE JUICE in it, lots of large ice cubes and no tequila to speak of.  At least they couldn't skimp on my husband's trio of tequilas.  The chips were tasty as were the three salsas.  Good thing, as when we FINALLY got our entrees, my Chicken Mole consisted of some dry, dry chicken over sticky white rice and a dark chocolate sauce.  The sauce was good, but I really needed some better rice and some tortillas.  My husband's trio plate (fish taco, cheese enchilada, beef tamale) was OK and did have a very nice Spanish rice and good beans.  The man at the next table got chicken mole and his plate had beans!  I guess I should wonder about a restaurant where the waitress starts out our order by telling us NOT to order the soup, "Everyone sends it back."  Find another restaurant where there actually have enough wait and cooking staff.  This place is hopeless.
