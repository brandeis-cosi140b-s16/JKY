I have been here twice in the past and remember it being pretty good and ok prices. Stopped while at the Luxor. I was really disappointed. $10+ plus for a house margarita that tasted pre made, we also got the nachos with steak. Small and the steak was all fat. With a bill that was almost $50 I would of expected more.
