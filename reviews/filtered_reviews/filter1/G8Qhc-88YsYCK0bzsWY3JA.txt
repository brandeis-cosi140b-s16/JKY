Went here before the Sam Smith concert at the stadium. Server was nice holy crap the food was terrible. I ordered a burrito and my friend ordered a salad, and they both came out uncomfortably fast. The chicken in my burrito tasted like it was marinated in soy sauce. Wtf. This is a Mexican restaurant. Use chili powder or something.

This is easily the worst Mexican food I've had in Arizona.

Don't waste your time or money here.
