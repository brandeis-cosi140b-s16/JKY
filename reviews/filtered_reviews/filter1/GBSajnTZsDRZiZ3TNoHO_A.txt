Im new to Phoenix and have yet to come out for Sunday brunch. Yesterday my fiance took me to the fabulous Dick's Hideaway. Being from San Francisco, he thought I would be impressed by their non-corporatism and lack of advertising (Dick's has no sign on the door)..

WE were offered a seat next to the fire place. It was cozy but we were sharing a table with another couple who came in behind us who we didn't know. That's fine, but they got up and left and our waitress informed us, 'they didnt belong here anyway'..

ok

My finance and I are not the richest couple in the land, however, we are highly attractive and generous tippers. The food came out very quickly. Not sure if that is a good thing.

Asked if I could sample the green chile sauce. I was charged $2.

My finance got up to use the restroom and the waitress snapped at me, 'Where did he go?' ..as if he was trying to escape without paying.

My fiance did not like his Bloody Mary, but waitress did not care to entice him with anything else.

We paid the bill with a card, left a cash tip and walked out the door only to have waitress run after us and ask us if we took a glass from the table. 

I looked at her like she was a kook.

Bye Dicks.
