$4 for stale, bagged chips and a small bowl of salsa.

Flat draft beer.

No enchiladas, chimichangas, or typical authentic Mexican dishes. 

Extremely high priced for extremely subpar food. 

So, go to 7Eleven, grab a six-pack (don't drink yet), and drive thru Taco Bell.  Then, take the $20 you saved and light it on fire. At least you're doing something better with that $20 than giving it to an overhyped, pathetic attempt at serving "food."
