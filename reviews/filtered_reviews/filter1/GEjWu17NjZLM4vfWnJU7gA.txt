gour*met (grme, gr me) 

n.  1. a connoisseur of fine food and drink; epicure.
adj. 2. of, characteristic of, or designed for gourmets.
3. of or involving fancy or exotic foods.

They should remove the word "gourmet" from the restaurant sign. 

The chips were pretty good. The service was lacklustre and ambivalent (would it kill you to smile, mr waiter?). The lighting was too bright. The chile relleno was soggy and swimming in tomato saucey water (whuuuut?). The burrito was huge but also swimming next to the relleno and a bit soggy (I felt guilty for having had an animal live and die just to go into that). 

I don't know what the high reviewers see in this place...maybe other reviewers have assessed it rightly that they just don't know good quality food. Maybe the giant portion sizes impress them; for me, it's just more bad food. I actually prefer Taco Bell to this overpriced underwhelming "gourmet" restaurant. I was craving Leticia's but they were closed. Next time I'll just wait. This place has Leticia's prices but not even fast food quality.  Disappointing.
