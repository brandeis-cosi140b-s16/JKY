Been waiting for my appetizers for 15mins to find out the salsa was from El Paso bottled salsa and chips were not fresh. You would expect the first impression  of a Mexican restaurant is their unique salsa not bottled salsa where you can get at Walmart. Then they have the audacity to give the chips in a white bag, since they are so lazy they can't even put it in a basket or plate. Hate to see how the food turns out. Here is hoping!!!
