Simply the blandest, colorless, pasty Mex food I've ever had. No spice, no flavor & lackluster presentation at best. Agree it tastes like it all just came out of a can. Better off spending the same at Rubios, Baja Fresh or even Taco Bell. Maybe with the new liquor license you can imbibe enough to make it taste good. Really wanted this place to be a hit since I live nearby and love my Mex, and it didn't bother me about the atmosphere or self seating - good for kids just not your taste buds.
