I will start by saying the smallest tip I have left in 10 years. Family just moved to Phoenix and we were recommended to come here. Many issues with this place:
#1. Terrible service.  We literally had to ask for more water and another cocktail more than once and we had to beg for our check (table next to us was asking the same thing - she asked 3 times for their check) 
#2. Food was bad. Carnitas was plain, plain, plain. My wife's enchilada was cold. 
#3. Prices were RIDICULOUS!!!! For my wife and I to have enchilada dinner (cheese), carnitas dinner, guacamole with chips, and 2 margaritas was $65.70 before tip. That's insane....oh yeah dinner took 1 hr and 15 mins at a Mexican restaurant. 

Diners beware!!!
