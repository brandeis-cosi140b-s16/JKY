Hostess was snooty & seemed to be bothered to seat us. Server was nice, but seriously not attentive had to keep waving our hands to try to get a refill. It was not even busy. 
The food was a small portion for that price $14.95 each plate. It was just super hot could not even taste any seasonings. 
Just had a burning mouth. Couldn't believe that we were charged $1.50 per tortilla.  You only get 1 tortilla with the meal.  Server should of mention the extra fee per tortilla. Will not go there again!!!
