No bueno. I'm not a fan of chains to begin with, so when my fiance told me he wanted to spend his birthday here I was less than thrilled with his decision. I had made a reservation for a surprise party and our hostess was less than secretive when I brought my fiance through the door. She just pointed and said "Yeah, they're in there" -thus giving away with the fact that others were waiting for him. We were then greeted by our server. The first thing out of his mouth was "You guys splitting checks?" We were. He then told us "K. Make sure to not move around the table then. You'll make it confusing for me". I started to feel guilty about sitting in his section. Like we had done something wrong. Anytime we asked him for anything he replied with an annoyed look on his face and said "Yeah, give me a minute". Over and over. He left the table before getting everyone's drink order, forgot things, and we had to one person's food through the manager. In short, he sucked. 

Shotty service aside, the food was AWFUL also. I ordered the Steak Cortez and every bite was pure fatty nastiness. Won't be going back.
