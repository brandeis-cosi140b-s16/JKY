You know you're in trouble when you walk into a Mexican restaurant and there's ketchup on the table rather than hot sauce.  We went for some food at this lame ass joint (my gf had a gift certificate) and the place was totally empty during the lunch hour, but I admired the large screen tvs and access to nonstop ESPN in hi-def if you like that sort of thing.  But then it all went downhill.  The seats were uncomfortable.  The staff seemed confused by everything.  The food was abysmal.  If we could give less than one star, we would!

Let me describe in more detail: literally every bite of food was sub-par, and we ordered four courses.  The fancy quesadilla was literally a big basic tortilla with pre-shredded American cheese.  I could have done better at home easily.  The "burro" had some major problems--chewy meat, crispy tortilla in the wrong way (dry), and beans that will immediately send you into salt overload.  The flautas were so greasy and unappetizing that we just said no.  I've never seen her send food back in my life.  Dessert was lame.

Avoid this place at ALL cost. . Seriously Taco Bell will do you better.  Go to a real Mexican joint and boycott this monstrosity of "Mexican" food.
