This place is terrible. The food is awful. I ordered the steak fajitas and it was not good. Service was bad, my sister who is vegan ordered the veggie fajitas, they gave her steak.  I ordered pico de gayo to go with the chips and salsa and it never came.  My husband got some steak thing and it was smothered with nacho cheese (I'm pretty sure from the can).  One thing positive was the place was packed with rowdy kids and families so it was kid friendly.
