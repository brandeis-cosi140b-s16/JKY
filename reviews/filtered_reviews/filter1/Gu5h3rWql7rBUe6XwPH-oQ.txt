The food was terrible!!! Expensive disgusting Mexican food. The menu had a $40 burrito! As soon as the food arrived so did the fruit flies. My chicken tacos were drenched with cheddar cheese and a paste I couldn't make out. I think they called it beans or maybe guacamole. Lol. The "Mexican rice" was made with very strong tomato paste. I give it a star because I have to give it something.
