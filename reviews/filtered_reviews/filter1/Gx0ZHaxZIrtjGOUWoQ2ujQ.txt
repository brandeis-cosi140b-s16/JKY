We stopped there for lunch and ordered the donkey nachos and ceviche. It was overpriced greasy and I had to send the ceviche back after the first bite. It was the worst ceviche I had ever put into my mouth. The staff was nice and the place it's self was very nice with a nice view. If only the food matched the surroundings.
