Being from TX  I was very disappointed in the food and even more with the service .. We ordered guacamole for an appetizer and waiter kept saying "they're working on it" our food came out and I told him to cancel the guacamole , he probably forgot to order it and blamed the kitchen .. I ordered the steak fajitas, they were tough as leather.. The onions and bell peppers were very oily / greasy as they came out sizzling on the skillet, the beans and rice were bland, absolutely no flavor , one bite and I was done with them.. It took a while to get the condiments for the fajitas, the sour cream / splash of guacamole.. Glad we canceled the   Guacamole appetizer cause if what I had with the fajitas  is the same batch I would've sent it back, again no flavor.. 
My husband had The green enchiladas he said they were so so he ate them but he wasn't real happy with them.. For the complimentary dessert they bring out sopapillas before we were even 1/2 way done with our food so by the time we were done and ready for them , they were ice cold.. Sopapillas are suppose to be nice and hot when consumed , that way the honey is slightly warm and gooey.. I asked for a fresh batch.. 
The service was subpar at best, I had to ask 3 different people for a small container to take home the salsa we had left over, finally the 3rd person brought it over.
We definitely won't be back tired of paying good money for subpar food and service.... Sorry...
