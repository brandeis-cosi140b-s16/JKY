Have eaten here twice and had a bad experience both times. The first time I ordered take out and was shorted half of the food I paid for. I called and they were barely apologetic. Not to mention the food I got was below room temperature cold. However, my girlfriend really enjoyed her food so we decided to give it another try. I order her food and checked the receipt after I paid and was overcharged by several dollars. Again, barely apologetic. They did refund me the overcharge but this is the second strike and I've had it with this place.
