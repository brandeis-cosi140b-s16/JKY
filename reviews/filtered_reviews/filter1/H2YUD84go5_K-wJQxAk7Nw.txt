An overall conclusion I would like to make here, is that it doesn't matter what you order from the dingy basement-like atmosphere of Chapala's...it all tastes the same!

I've been wanting to go here for so long and finally did, which was majorly disappointing. I ordered a chili relleno entree which included rice and beans. I also ordered a tamale on the side. Accompanied by a family member, she also ordered a similar entree with a side dish. Considering portion size, this place doesn't disappoint. Everything else? It heavily does. 
There was absolutely NO flavor in any of the food. My chili relleno was ice in the middle and had a strange taste, which implied that it wasn't made fresh and most likely brought in frozen. I wouldn't argue if their other food was "prepared" the same way. This explains how our food came out quickly, wasn't even hot and tasted heavily of just salty refrigeration. 
I glanced over at other cutomers' plates and everything just looked the same...uniform, flavorless and just overall, no excitement. Chapala's serves traditional mexican food but in the worst ways possible. There's nothing fresh here, no exuberant colors and flavors jumping out at you when tasting these foods. Just cold, old and dead. I could say the same about the atmosphere as well as our waitress, who had the most odd-like personality I've ever encountered at a restaurant. No greetings, smiles or even explanations of anything, let alone talking. 

This place is dead, which also explains their 44 demerits they have just recently were closed for. I feel sick just thinking about it now.
