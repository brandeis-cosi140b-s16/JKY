This place was the worst Mexican food restaurant that I have ever been!  I ordered a chimichanga enchilada style and it was terrible. The enchilada sauce was made from a can, the chimichanga was over cooked, the chicken in the chimichanga was dry and the salsa doesn't even pass for salsa. The refried beans weren't fresh at all.  The whole time my co-worker and I were eating there we kept hearing a microwave being used. They don't even a use a cheese sauce on top of the chimichanga or the burritto my co-worker ordered. Both of our meals came out to be $15 with only drinking water.  So not worth the price we paid for this food.  I will never eat here again!
