What happened to their food? I'll had a cup of albondigas soup and the meatballs were cold and tasted like the frozen kind that you throw into soup! My chicken tamale was also cold in the center!  My friend ordered the breakfast burrito and took two bites and declares it inedible, paid our bill and left. Won't be throwing away any more money in there! Very disappointed,  they used to be so good,  not anymore!
