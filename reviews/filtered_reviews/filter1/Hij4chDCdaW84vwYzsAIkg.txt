I heard good things about Diego's Happy Hour & had it in my radar for awhile, only thing keeping me from coming sooner is, as with all restaurants in the MGM it's not easy to get to them, parking in the garage, then walking through the Star Lane Shops, then the casino, then the long hallway through restaurant row. Well it was Memorial Day weekend & a friend and I were feeling motivated to make the trek. I had called ahead to make sure they were still doing Happy Hour on Sundays, I spoke with a really nice hostess who informed me they were actually doing Happy Hour from 2-5:30 (normal HH is 4-5:30) in honor of Memorial Day. We got there at 4, sat down at the bar and asked for a HH menu, the bartender says "my mgr stopped HH at 4" I told him that I had just called and spoke with a hostess who informed me differently. He replied " do you want to take it up with my mgr" I said sure. So he leaves to go get the mgr, when he returns he says to us "I don't feel like chasing  him around so I guess I will just honor it" and proceeds to toss us a menu. I notice only drinks on the menu and I asked if there was a food HH menu, he said no, I showed him a picture of the online HH menu from their website and he just shrugged his shoulders and said "I don't know". From this point on he was a complete jerk to us. Cesar is his name. He acted like we were a bother to him. He would speak Spanish to the other bartender, in front of us, which is totally unprofessional. We ended up ordering a pitcher of margaritas, which weren't good at all, and some nachos that made up for the margaritas, but for $12 they should be good as the portion was small. 

I have no tolerance for people who are in the customer service industry and act like this. You are a bartender. I get we all have bad days, but no excuse to be total jerk to your customers. You lost two customers and I will for sure tell my friends to avoid this place.
