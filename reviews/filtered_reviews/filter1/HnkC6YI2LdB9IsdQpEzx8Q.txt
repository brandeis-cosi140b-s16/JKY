When you sit around and have a debate about whether or not this was the worst Mexican food you've ever had, well, that exemplifies what kind of experience this was.

We went on Cinco de Mayo, and were in somewhat of a hurry as we had other obligations to attend to. I thought that at 5pm, we could slip in, grab a table in the bar, grab food and beverage and get on our way.

To be quick, and to the point, the service was good, but the food was absolutely garbage. Bland, flat, uninspired... 

Between the purple power rangers (Pro-Tem Rent-a-Cop), the 20 year old manager, and the horrific food, I'll go out of my way to not go here again.
