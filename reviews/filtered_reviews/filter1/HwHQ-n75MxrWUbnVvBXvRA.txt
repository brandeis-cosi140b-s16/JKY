Something fell apart here on July 2nd at 8:30p.

While in line, I ordered a fire grilled chicken burrito. The woman tried forcing the other chicken option when I protested she said it'd be 20 minutes for fire grilled chicken. How does that happen? Throwing up my arms- I decided to wait it out. To my left a woman ordered two tacos and was very specific about her order being separated. They botched that. Combining the tacos with one side of salad and rice. Since It turned into a huge line - I went to the checkout and use my full frequent customer card. Instead of checking me out I had to wait 10 minutes with two other livid customers. One of which had been waiting some time for napkins to be refilled and another fuming that he didn't get his desert for his son. What a mess. Needless to say, I paid and picked up my disaster of a burrito - over-packed with fire-grilled chicken and ripped in 3 places. Except they were convinced I hadn't paid yet. Had to present my receipt for that. 

With their kitschy slogan  "every meal a masterpiece" this was a charlatan's Jackson Pollock. Won't be back.
