Went here for lunch with my husband today.  Let me put it this way, we got our food and mine had to be sent back due to something being in my food(things happen).  My husband completed his meal and I waited as long as I could - 1/2 hour, but told them to box it up since I could not handle sitting there any longer.  Still waited.
MOST IMPORTANTLY
I would say that the service sucked, but I can not blame the servers.  They also had only one cook which was not enough for the few people that were ordering, making a very long wait. The food was just sitting on the pass thru as the servers weren't able to get to it.  Could not imagine if it was busier.  There was a manager/bartender on duty and think she was given this title so no one else would have to show up.  The place was severely under staffed.  Apparently someone had called in sick, which I know can happen.  When talking to the manager, I had made mention of how under staffed it was and she told me they were waiting for someone to show up.  They needed more then 1 more server to handle the place and it was not even full.  She also mentioned they had a GM and he was coming in later that night.  He should of been there then to cover.  This comes down to the owner that has no knowledge of what is going on or doesn't care.  
GM- OWNER
During the course of visit there were 25-30 people who left due to not being waited on.  I know because they all had to walk past us.  I think this is a shame since it money just walking out the door.  You can not blame the staff on duty as they were trying to get the people already there taken care of and that was even a struggle.  If you do not care about the place then close it down and let someone else take the opportunity to make worth going to.
