Seriously Vegas!?!?! Is THIS what you consider Mexican food? Good Food? This isnt even on the standards of Chipotle!!!! I gave this place 3 tries... every time the food was cold, the order was wrong, the workers behind the counter are totally useless and worse yet the food was beyond NASTY!!!! Theres not enough salsa, hot sauce and wishful thinking to make this stuff good. Every single person who gave this place 5 stars deserves a fat ass kick in the face... dont trust these dummies who consider this good food!
