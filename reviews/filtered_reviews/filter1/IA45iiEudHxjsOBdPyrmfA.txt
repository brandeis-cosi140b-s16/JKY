One star-ness is for the view.  This is a great spot to hear live Mexican music and socialize....HOWEVER, if you order food or come into contact with most of their staff (minus the management & hostess, they're pleasant) then you'll begin to dislike this place as much as I do.
I TRULY attempt to give businesses and people the benefit of doubt, and after my visit today, NOPE, NO MORE!!!!  
Horrible!  I was bitter when I paid my tab.  Ugh! Off to meditate to purge this negative feeling.
