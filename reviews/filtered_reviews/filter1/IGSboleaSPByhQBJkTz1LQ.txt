We walked into Zapatas at 2 in the afternoon on a Saturday. We had a party of 5. The restaurant was virtually empty. We ordered one margarita each, and snacked on the chips and salsa; excellent. Soon we began to wonder if the order for margaritas had gone through to the bar. We inquired, and were told " they will be here shortly". After waiting 20 minutes, our margaritas finally arrived. They tasted great, but were not worth the $14 charge. We asked, and there were only 2 shots of liquor in them. We then waited an additional 30 minutes from the time we ordered our food. The food was presented well, but upon the first bite, we noticed something was off. The shredded chicken in my husband's taco salad tasted and smelled like tuna! We were convinced it was tuna, and the waitress said that it indeed wasn't. My husband didn't finish his meal or get anything else because it literally smelled so disgusting. Then, I noticed that my salad was missing 80% of the ingredients that it included on the menu, and that my grilled chicken was dry and chewy. Our service was great, that was the one upside.
