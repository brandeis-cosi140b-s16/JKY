The wet taco had a terrible sauce on it, the regular burrito had soggy black beans so it was a wet taco by the time we sat down. Poor imitation of Chipotle. Would not repeat 2/10.

I don't think that it was all bad, the lady was nice and gave us samples. By themselves the meat was good but in a burrito the other ingredients were drowning out the flavor.
