Arrived, and was greeted by a very nice young lady that seated me almost immediately.  This is where the good experience ended and the terrible one began. it took approximately 25 minutes for my server to arrive at my table to ask me what I wanted to drink,  About 10 minutes later my Diet Coke arrived and my server was off again.  Now realizing I was at the Airport I assumed that she was overly busy only to find out that all of her customers were being treated the same way.  In the time it took her to get me a drink and take my order the patron eating next to me arrived at his table, ordered, got his Tacos, ate, and left.  I was just ordering.  Different server of corse.  About 5 minutes after my neighbor patron left my serve appeared again asking me what I wanted to eat.  I ordered a Burrito, a Burro Pollo Poblano to be exact and a salad.  my food arrived 28 minutes later.  On a scale of 1 to 10, Taste 2, Would have been better if it was hot and the Tortilla was not hard and stale,  Appearance:  2, What looked like a half of a normal Burrito with a bowl of salad with no dressing.  Service:  0.5,  If it was only me i may have given it a two because i did get a refill on my soda.  Quality Control:  0  Food should never leave the kitchen in that condition.  Overall experience:  1  It I did not have a 2 hour flight and had not eaten all day I would have not eaten more than more than the 2 bites that I did eat, and sent it back after the first bite.

If the restaurant in Phoenix is as bad as this, I have just lost total respect for the James Beard committee that nominated this chef.
