So we came here for the food and wine festival and it was a huge let down ... they didn't have anything pre arranged for this event. They had alot of people specifically for this event and they didn't even have set drinks ( mimosa/bloody Mary's) pre poured so there were unnecessary lines for drinks !! The food I've been waiting over an hour for food from the kitchen. They do have a buffet but it basically had eggs fruit and biscuits ... not very well rounded. The execution was terrible so it will be a long time before I come here for another food and wine festival !!
