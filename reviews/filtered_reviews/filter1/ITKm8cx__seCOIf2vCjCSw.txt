I really hate having to write this because I really was hoping that I was going to have this delicious mouth watering experience after reading the reviews. 
   Unfortunately this was not the case, as I stepped into the restaurant the decor was something I pictured a Mariscos restaurant would look so colorful and beautiful and my server was friendly and that is were it ends.
   I ordered a water of jamica w/o ice as I took a sip to my disappointment it was warm. Now I ask myself shouldn't fresh fruit water drinks be placed in ice or the refrigerator to avoid contamination? So for my meal I had the shrimp ceviche plate and as I took a bite of my tostada all I could taste is the staleness of the tostada and saltiness of the civiche and I am one who LOVES salt. The shrimp definitely was not fresh (I wonder if it may have been canned?). So I brought it to the waitress attention that the saltine crackers and tostadas were stale. She informed me that the restaurant was aware of this. Now why would a 4 1/2 star restaurant serve stale food to their customers?
   Mariscos Playa Hermosa I wish I could say my food made my taste buds dance but it did not.
