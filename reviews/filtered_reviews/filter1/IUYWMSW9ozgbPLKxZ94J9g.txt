Not my style.  Maybe others find this food appealing, I found it had bland appearance and flavors, and very little for the cost.  

I ordered Teriyaki Steak and Rice, passed on the beans, because the combo wasn't appealing.  Meat tasted like it had flowers on it, not sure if it was Jasmine Rice?  Either way very weird. 

Hubby ordered a smothered burrito, left him hungry.  

Place was clean but pretty empty for a Saturday night, there is a bar maybe with casino?  Not sure. Which is blocked off so you won't be exposed to smoking.
