One word for this place.... blech.

I'm not too proud to admit I've been here a few times (for some reason my husband used to like to go here...), and every time has been disappointing at best.  The service at this particular location is just AWFUL.  So awful, in fact, that we had a whole meal for three comped once after the food took over 45 minutes to arrive after ordering.

Then there's the issue of the really greasy, low-quality food that always leaves me with a tummy ache.  YUCK.  I honestly can't think of anything good to say about OTB.  Sorry.
