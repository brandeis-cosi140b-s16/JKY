I got sick from their food.
I should have read their yelp reviews before deciding to have lunch here.

My girlfriend got the fish tacos and asked for no cheese (lactose intolerant). They brought the dish out with cheese. So we apologized and let them know that she is is allergic to cheese and needed the dish to be remade. The server said, "ok, we'll make a new dish"

A few minutes later, they brought the dish out. It had one sliver of cheese on it and messy sauce on top. They had just removed the cheese instead of making a new dish!!

So we notified the manager. If she just didn't like cheese or couldn't have it for a silly reason, we would have let it pass. But, she cannot have the slightest bit of dairy... so we took it seriously. 

I don't recommmend this place. Go get an Auntie Anne's pretzel instead :)
