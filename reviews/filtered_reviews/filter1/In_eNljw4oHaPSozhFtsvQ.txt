My friends and I had dinner Saturday night after New Years, and the food totally sucked, it made me sick right after I finished eating. I had the chilaquiles and one tinga taco and it game diarrhea in less than 5min took me twice to the restroom ... I was in there for 10min both times .. I totally do not recommend this place. Totally over price$$$ whoever says this place is good it's probably because they had never taste real mexican food.
