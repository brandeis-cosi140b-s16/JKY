If I could give zero stars I would. Service was HORRIBLE. and I mean it was HORRIBLE. We sat down and usually they give you menu but no, we waited for 5 minutes before we had to physically get up and ask for one. Once our "server" finally approached us she didn't say her name, didn't even ask us how we were doing, instead she asked us for our drink order. Look, I've worked at many different restaurants before and I understand that at times you get busy. But, it was so dead that night, absolutely no excuses. We went ahead and order our food since getting her attention again would be very difficult I would assume. Our drink finally came out and nothing was right! I don't understand.. And on top of that she switched us up to a different server which by the way never came up to us. And of course our food order was incorrect (what a surprise) The only person that actually helped us out was Brice (I hope I spelled his name right) Which is why we tipped him and no one else.
 I could've gone to McDonald's paid half the price since our tab was well over 100$ and I would've been much happier. I really do hope you guys do some training because I can tell you whenever someone asks me what I think about this place I will defiantly not recommend it, as a matter of fact I would beg them not to go.
