My friends and I ate here while waiting for our flight.  I had some chili fries while everyone else had burgers.  

I'll start with the chili fries.  They're made with waffle fries and beef.  Someone doesn't know what chili is.  The cheese was sparse and there was a smattering of sour cream on top.  All of this came together to form the worst chili fries I've ever eaten.  

The burgers were about as good.  The buns were hard and my friends had to request more which didn't come out much better.  The cheese was congealed and the burgers came with bacon, which they didn't order.  The waiter's response?  "Oh well, at least you don't have to pay for it."

If only we all could have been so lucky.
