I haven't been here since 2012.  Said the only thing I would go back for is the shredded beef tacos.  Well nothing has changed food is lousy and staff is rude..I can't believe all the 4 and 5 star ratings for this place.  This use to be one of the best Mexican food places in town.  My family has come here since the 60's.
