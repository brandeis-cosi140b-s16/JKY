Gross.  Wife didn't even bother to take left-overs.  Place does not look clean.  A warning sign for us should have been that this "mexican" place is staffed with gringo servers.  Every quesadilla we ordered arrived soggy, not a single item we ordered was crisp.   Margarita was one of the worst we've had in the north valley (which is really saying something).  Kids seats had broken seat belts.

All of this is sad because we had high hopes for this place especially after reading the positive reviews.

Not mexican, but infinitely better is Mi Comida at 43rd Ave & Bell.
