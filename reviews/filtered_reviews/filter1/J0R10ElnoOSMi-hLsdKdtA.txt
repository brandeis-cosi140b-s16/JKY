I went to cabo fish taco tonight after seeing a live music show. We were seated and ordered some food but I was refused a margarita for no apparent reason other than he felt we had already been drinking. Yes, I had a drink before, but I was not drunk and I was made to feel like I was. It is not only embarrassing but unprofessional. We decided to leave and go to another more deserving establishment that is not judgmental.
