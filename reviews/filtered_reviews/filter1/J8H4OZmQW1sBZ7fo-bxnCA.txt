Oh my.  If you're going to be a NACHO restaurant, you should have good NACHOS.  Seems simple, right?  

These nachos were gross.  The combination of flavors just didn't work.  The chips were stale and covered in Cheez Whiz.  Hey, I could make that at home!  I'm sure I have all the ingredients somewhere in my pantry!  Also, the service was lousy.  We were largely ignored other than when we ordered, and even then, we had to beg someone to come help us.  We didn't even get drinks until AFTER we got our nachos.

Do yourself a favor.  Stay home and eat some cheap, bagged tortilla chips.  They will likely taste better.
