I will never come to this chipotle again.I had to watch 3 employees blow a condom up like a balloon, play with it like 13 year olds and then pop it making a loud bang so everyone could hear. Oh and the salsa looked and tasted old.

What does the manager do? Goes up and gives then a little pat on the back and say "don't do it again". He walked away laughing with employees. Any decent manager would of fired this employee on the spot.

It was disgusting. My Gf is writing to their corporate. N
