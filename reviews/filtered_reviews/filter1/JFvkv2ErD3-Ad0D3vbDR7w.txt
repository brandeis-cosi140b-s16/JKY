We've been to Cabo Fish Taco several times. It's usually ok. Not terrible food, but surely nothing spectacular either. 

(disclaimer: my first fish tacos were eaten in Tulum, Quintana Roo, Mexico...most wonderful thing ever.)

We went with a group, 6 in all, on Saturday. We arrived about 2:20. Sat, ordered drinks and crab dip. Enjoyed drinks and crab dip, and ordered food, only 5 of us ordered food, all tacos.

then we waited...and waited

.......and waited

....................still waited.

About an hour after we ordered the waitress said our food would be ready soon.

30 minutes later we asked her again.

It was ANOTHER FULL 30 MINUTES before food arrived, cold and awful.

They said that their computer system was broken, but somehow they were able to fill every other table's order. We saw others seated, fed, and gone.

And the food...cold, how do you cook something at the last minute, but deliver it cold? Our mashed potatoes wouldn't even melt the cheese. The tacos were just...just...there aren't words for how much it sucked.

We were in the restaurant until 5:00. Now, I'm all for leisurely eating...but not for this.

They did discount our food, but that wasn't the point really. We would have been more than happy to pay full price for a decent edible meal.
