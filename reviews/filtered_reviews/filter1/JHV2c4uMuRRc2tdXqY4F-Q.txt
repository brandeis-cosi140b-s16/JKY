Holy shit! Just left there and I've never been so frusterated in my entire life. If I could give a zero I would. My mother and I sat there for 15 minutes watching our food sit in the window....took 20 minutes to get her wine...so finally...I went up and got everything myself.  All of the waitresses stand around and ignore the customers and refuse to help eachother run food...fill drinks...etc. Finally I ran my own food and the chicken sandwich was okay but I've had better burgers from mcdonalds! Not a fan!  Wouldn't recommend it!
