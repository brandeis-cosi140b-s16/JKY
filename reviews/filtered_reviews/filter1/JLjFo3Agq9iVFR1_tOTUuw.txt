I hate lines, I hate telling people over a glass wall what I want but I craved mexican food and wanted something that was close to my house so I ordered online to save time and stress. I ordered it at 12:45 and it said pick-up would be ready at 1:15 so I arrived at 1:10. Not only was the burrito COLD but, it wasn't even what I ordered!

My online order:
****Barbacoa Burrito ($9.15) Brown Rice, Black Beans, Barbacoa, Fresh Tomato Salsa, Sour Cream, Cheese, Guacamole****

What they gave me:
****STEAK Burrito with WHITE RICE and BLACK BEANS**** that is it....

Can someone please explain how this is acceptable? It was also cold which means they must have made it within 3 minutes and it was sitting there the entire time. Now here is what really makes me mad. I don't eat steak, not by choice, I just can't because when I eat red meat it makes me sick like food poisoning sick so the fact that they put steak in my burrito just crossed the line. What a waste of time and money spent. 

Also, that $2 soda I paid for was DISGUSTING which I should have known after I placed my cup under the "Coke Zero" only to find out it was flat Sprite, probably should have tasted the "regular Coke" before leaving the location but I was hungry and just wanted to get back home to finish my lunch and then get back to work.

I honestly will never be stepping inside any chipotle ever again after this experience. This totally makes me laugh at those who want minimum wage to be $15 a hour when they can't even do a simple job right. So disappointed.
