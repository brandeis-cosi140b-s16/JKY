The worse experience ever when to eat dinner to this restaurant and when the hosted girls seated us the waitress inform our party that we needed to order food in twenty minutes. We where really surprise and was wondering why the hosted girls did not tell us this. This was just the beginning the rude waitress that can care less about us. I told her several times that my sisters food was hard and burned she would care less. She did not care, services sucked, food sucked and I will never come here. Please don't waste your time or money here.
