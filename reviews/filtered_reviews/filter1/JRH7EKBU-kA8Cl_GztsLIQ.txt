Ordered a carne asada beef burrito.....it's 99% bean just so you know.  Be prepared for disappointment. The waitress was nice and she said that this is a common complaint from customers. The manager came over and explained that their burritos are made pre-portioned and they use really good beef so you get less. That's what the cook told her, I won't call him a "chef" like she did. Someone should tell him that some people like beef burritos and some people like bean burritos. That's why there are different kinds. You don't jam a beef burrito full of beans and put a trace amount of beef and call it a beef burrito. Had street tacos, chicken and beef, they were so bland.  Must not have seasonings in the kitchen. Lindo Michoacan is a MUCH better choice. Every dish lacked seasoning. They will not be open long.  You can only survive so long on "first time" customers before the word gets out.  I was there on a Saturday night at 8:30.  Prime time for Saturday night dinner crowd, but there were many empty tables here.  A sign of things to come for Nacho Daddy.  Too bad.
