Food was awesome but over cast by the really bad service you get. Our waiter was the worst I ever had and we visits many restaurants in las Vegas. He was rude and not attentive at all he did not checked on us even bump into my chair and didn't acknowledge. The person getting our drinks was just as bad. The manager was nice but the damage was already. Sorry I will not be coming back nor would I recommend this to tourist. This is Vegas we provide great service! Mundo just don't have it.
