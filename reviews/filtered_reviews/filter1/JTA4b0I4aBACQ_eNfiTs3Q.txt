On the Border is akin to a burning ship doomed to sink. I used to love this place... Used to. Owned by the same owners as Chili's which also failing in Vegas. We came here tonight for the Monday special (fajitas) and we left with me gagging not once but three times. The chicken was of such poor quality it had more fat and gristle on it than a steak, I actually had to spit a mouthful of that junk into a napkin 3 times! I used to give good reviews here... I'm done with this place
