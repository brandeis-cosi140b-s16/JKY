I decided to grab an appetizer and a drink after seeing Janelle Monae at the Marquee in January. Based on reviews, I didn't expect much, but my experience didn't even meet the meager expectations I had set going in. 

The server, whose name I cannot recall, came to our table maybe twice outside of the initial order and serving of food. We had to wait forever for drink refills, the people who arrived later were forced to linger tirelessly while the server attended to the rest of the restaurant, which was roughly 2/3 empty. 

We ordered several appetizers to start: Mini Chimichangas, Beef Taquitos, Fiesta Wings and Nachos Supreme. Every last bite we took of each item was mediocre-at-best and the chimi's were lukewarm by the time they arrived. 

Upon venturing into Macayo's we all assumed we would order actual meals too but because of the slow, substandard service and the barely-edible food, we passed on entrees. We paid for our food and left. 

Will not return.
