The server was friendly, and that is where it ended. Assume everything has cilantro even if the menu doesn't list it. Dinner was awful, house made tortillas weren't even good- they were rubbery and oily. They knew I wasn't happy with my dinner and made no adjustments or efforts. $46 for a crappy dinner for two. On par with the rest of the Hard Rock property. We won't be back. Wish I could make the rating less than 1 star.
