This place is a joke. Second time I've been in here and they have charged me for items placed on my plate. I was charged $2.50 for small dribble of onions $2.50 and for refried beans which I ate in four bites. They charged me for rice and green Chile.  By the time I got out of there with a ice tea drink I was charged over $20 for a very simple small meal. The waitress was running from one area to the other area and was extremely slow getting to our table. There was nobody attending the bar area and we were there for 30 minutes and never seen anybody in that area.
