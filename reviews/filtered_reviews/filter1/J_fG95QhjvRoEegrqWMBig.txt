I had the chile rellenos, I asked them to leave the green chiles off, What I got were two burnt dried out rellenos with that cheap cheese you buy in a jar for $1.99 next to the chips in the super market inside the chiles and no sauce over them at all, matter of fact everything they made here had that type of cheap yellow cheese smothered on it, ( except none on the relenos ), just in them!
The Spanish rice was the wrong kind of rice with a sweetness to it! The beans were stuck together with burnt cheese. I eat Mexican all over Las Vegas since the fifties! This was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had!!! This is not an isolated experience, the very ingredients they are using as well as the cooking method are a extremely poor attempt at Mexican cuisine. The sopaipillas were good. I felt like I had been robbed of 42.00 dollars and change after the experience! Stay away....you are warned
