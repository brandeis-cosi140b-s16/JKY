I've been eating at Fausto's  Mexican grills for 10 year the rainbow location was my introduction to these restaurants and I eat a breakfast burrito every morning at work and after you watch them cook your made to order breakfast burrito for years you get a custom to seeing them prepare your food , 
So today 12-05 14 at 1:00 pm I go to the collage location which I've been going to since they've opened , I ordered my breakfast burrito and walk over to bag my sauces and wonder why I don't see anyone cooking my lunch , I walk over to the guy that took my order and he hands me a lukewarm breakfast burrito in a bag and says here you go , well I'm stunned and I ask him where this come from I just ordered my food a minute and a half ago nobody made me any fresh eggs so I can wear this come from , and with a stupid smile on his face he says are they just made it and I tell him dude I was getting sauces I just ordered it I get sauces and nobody cooked anything, and with stupid smile on his face I tell him dude it's not even hot are you going to cook a fresh one and he just continued to smile at me like all of a sudden he doesn't speak or understand English I just asked for my money back and he thought it was pretty funny . I'll never go to this location again I'm not putting down all these restaurants but this punk that works at this location on collage needs to learn customer service , Buyer beware at Fausto's grill # 3 . 
Will never recommend or ever take my family or friends there ever again , due to this clown . I give them one star for past performance.
