I stopped here to eat as it seemed like the healthier choice of the 2 options in terminal B. I ordered 2 chicken tacos with corn tortillas. The girls behind the counter were busy talking about their personal lives. As one of the food preparers hastily prepared my taco on the counter, I noticed that she slapped down 4 tortillas that tore when she grabbed them.  I thought, she surely isn't going to actually prepare my tacos with broken up tortillas.  But I was wrong, as she continued to chit chat with the girl next to her, she shoved them in a bowl and stuffed them with chicken, lettuce, pico de gallo, and guacamole.  I thought it was odd to received tacos in a bowl. I proceeded to eat at the counter and thought since they were made with two tortillas they would stay together. When I picked them up, they were semi cold, under heated, and bottomed out and fell apart. Why would you prepare food for a customer with damaged ingredients? Needless to say, after the taco bottomed out and fell into the sleeve of my sweater, I continued with a fork.  I was so annoyed as I listened to this crew continue to chit chat in front of customers with lack of care for the quality of food, appearance, and customer experience.  Management should read the reviews and share them with the employees and work to improve your food quality and experience!
