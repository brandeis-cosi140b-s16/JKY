The entire dining experience was horrific. The only thing going for this place is its unique decor. We were sat immediately only to sit ten minutes without being greeted and the restaurant was not very busy (about 50% occupancy). Eventually, someone came over and asked if we had been helped and when we said no he was very surprised and grabbed our drink orders. The entire night was a disaster since the beginning, our waters went unfilled and our server disappeared for twenty minutes at a time, making it difficult to order and refill our drinks. On top of the terrible service don't expect to have a conversation here, you'll find yourself screaming and at loss of a voice by the end of your disappointing experience. Also, this place is not group friendly and will not even split a bill up into two bills. I would also not recommend this place for children, between the gigantic bull in the middle of the restaurant and the choice to blast tasteless music, it is very apparent this is not a kid friendly environment.  My group and I could overlook the errors and lack of service if the food was good but they couldn't even nail that. A lot of the items we ordered were greasy and thrown onto the plate. The only compliment I can award is for the guacamole which is comparable to Chipotle but at $9 cost.
