FOOD REVIEW:  You'd think a place called Nacho Daddy would have outstanding nachos - not the case at this typical run-of-the-mill chain offering.  Although not really a chain yet (Fremont East location coming soon), the food at this joint is just nasty.  I ordered the Chicken Enchilada nachos, which came with ample chicken, but was smothered in what tasted to me like canned enchilada sauce - the kind you get at any super.  The refritos tasted canned as well and were frankly cold.   The chips were stale.  All in all, the food was not good.  If you want chain nachos stick with Applebees.

SERVICE REVIEW:  The waitress talked over me so she missed the part where I said, "no sour cream."  Took forever to get our order. 

ATMOSPHERE REVIEW:  If they're going for the 13-year-old girl crowd, then they have it nailed.  For the first 20 minutes there was just the silence of a half empty restaurant - no music, no sound from the ample TVs in the bar.  Then suddenly - music, but the "Call Me Maybe" kind of music designed for fans of Justin Beiber.  We were expecting some hip, upscale Mariachi or salsa music.  This will never fly on Fremont East.  Fail.  What can you expect when the menu board notes  "children eat free."
