Food is usually excellent.  Small portions.  My gripe......10.00 for chips and salsa!!,,!,!,!,,,!!,!omg.  If you want to be a fucking Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, charge 14.00 for three small street tacos, and charge customers for a bowl of chips and salsa.  I will walk to the other establishments in in C or A.  You seem to have lost sight of your roots.  If I spend 35.00 for drinks and food, 2.00 worth of chips and salsa seem to be a no brainier.  I can understand if they order a water and chips and salsa but not for paying customers!!!! Never again barrio!
