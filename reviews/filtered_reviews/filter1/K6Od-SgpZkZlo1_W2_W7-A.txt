We found nothing to like about TeePee. We tried take out twice because it was near work. We were not impressed either time. So far we've tried the machaca taco, cheese enchilada, green chili burro and chicken burro. Everything including both salsas were lacking in flavor and the chips were stale, like last night's or last week's. Overall, the food tasted like something you'd get at a fast food joint like Taco Bell. Actually, Taco Bell is better. 

The service was not so hot either. Neither time did they have our order ready when we arrived even though we had called ahead and been given a pick up time. We will definately NOT be going there again. BTW - we tried their famous chile relleno a few years back and were equally unimpressed. It was just a whole lot of whipped egg whites with a little green chili and ordinary cheese. The sauce was okay but not enough to try again. Don't bother going.
