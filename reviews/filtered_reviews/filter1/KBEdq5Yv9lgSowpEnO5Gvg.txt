Waited 1/2 hr for two sides of the Mexican street corn. Eventually I asked why it was taking so long since people who ordered after us with full entrees had already ate and left. They laughed at me very rudely as if I was being ridiculous or something. The receipt said it had been half an hour. We finally get our corn and two bites later we were throwing it away in the trash where it belonged. Horrible service with horrible food.
