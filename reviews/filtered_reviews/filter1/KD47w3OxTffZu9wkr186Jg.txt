Even by airport standard this place is a complete joke.  I know its a money grab, but even still,  I cant believe the great Sammy Hagar would even put his name on this garbage.

The food is gross, the place doesnt feel clean, there are plastic utensils, its way over priced. 

Just grab a sandwich from a kiosk or eat on the plane or better yet, starve.  Any of these options are better than this complete dump.
