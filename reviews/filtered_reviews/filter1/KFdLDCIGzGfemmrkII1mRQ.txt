This place was such a let down. It has such great potential with its gorgeous atmosphere. For starters they allow NO substitutions. If you want your sizzling chicken fajitas do not come here. They only allow pulled chicken,pulled pork and pulled beef. when I asked the manager why they would not substitute pan seared chicken (since they apparently have no grill) he told me that it was too "laborous" to do so and it was was easier to let a pot of shredded chicken sit on the grill and use it as needed. The mini shrimp quesadilla was NOT a quesadilla at all. It was on a small open faces corn tortilla that had not been grilled or anything and not ONLY that, there was NO cheese on this so called QUESAdilla. The tortilla soup was like a liquified cow lick. The amount of sodium in this soup could send someone to the hospital if the whole thing were eaten. the margaritas did not taste "fresh & made with orange juice" it tasted like a mix you could buy in the store. 

Overall this was a HORRIBLE experience from the customer service to the food. I would not recommend any one to come here seeing as there are many other Mexican restaurants that deserve the support of patrons.
