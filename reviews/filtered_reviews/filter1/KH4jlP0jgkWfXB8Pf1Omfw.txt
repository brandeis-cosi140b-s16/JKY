Very disappointed in the service that place offers...The wait staff should get proper training in regards to customer service we had a guy approach the table and ask us for drinks. .then a min later another one. ..we told him that someone else had taken it...Once we got our drinks the server came and got our order. ..then a lady asked if we were ready. ..I was so confused didn't know who our server was...appetizer was brought out and then our entree but our appetizer was taken away :-(. .. we were not done. .I order a carne asada plate. ..but once I tasted it I realized it was not carne asada it was more like milanesa. .I told the waitress cause she said that now she was our waitress. .and she said I dunno. ..seemed so confused. ..I asked to speak to the Mgr....and 5 mins must of past and I asked her if she had told him and she said I don't think he will come. ..but 4 min later a server who was on the other side came and acted like the mgr. He was soo rude unprofessional and told me that it was good carne asada that he had sold over 50 plates that day and I was the only one that didn't like it. ..didn't help whatsoever. ..I didn't eat...left very upset and noone checked on us after wards. .I would of totally walked out. ..but I believe in karma. ..so i had to hunt down someone to pay. ..not going back
