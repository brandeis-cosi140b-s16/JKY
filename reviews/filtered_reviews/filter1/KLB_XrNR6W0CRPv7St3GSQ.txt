Decoration is great and the chips and salsa are amazing.... That's where I'll stop with the compliments.... This place is by far somewhere I will not plan on going back to. 

We were here last Sunday with a group of 6 because the kind for Hash House was incredibly long and we were hungry. The food here is terrible and I'd compare it to diner food, but the diners I've been to have better food than Chayo. It's not just the food, the service is subpar --- who asks their server for a drink 3 times & gets a dumbstruck reaction every time like it's the first time they've ordered it? We shouldn't have been surprised, but we got the drink after we got our food. We had to ask for it to get comp'd when it should've been something offered & a manager should've came tour table, especially after every salad we ordered came DRY & only 1 person asked for "dressing on the side." At one point, someone other than our server came to our table to double check on the salads (after we asked for dressing), however, they didn't identify themselves as a manager if they were one.

It's really a shame that this places sucks because the designers made it beautiful and reminds me of a Javier's look, but they've got a long way to go to earn their 5 stars.
