iI recently ate at Ricardo's there were very few patrons. My fajitas were served with sour beef full of fat. My friends food was cold.
The service was less than standard. When finished the waiter never removed any of the plates.
He was sure to tell us when paying with a credit card about leaving at least a 15% tip!
