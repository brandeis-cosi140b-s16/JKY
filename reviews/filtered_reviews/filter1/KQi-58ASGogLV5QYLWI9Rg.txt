We've been going here for the past 5 years, but the service has gone downhill for about the past year, they seem to have gone to all waiters, which is fine I guess, but they all have attitudes as though they are doing you a favor by serving you- Extremely rude and unprofessional service. The food is only OK, a bit bland for my taste, there are enough Mexican Joints in Vegas, won't be putting up with the snippy little bitch waiters.
