$30 for 2 people! This place DOES NOT deserve 4 stars. The avocado  while they used real ones, it was just mashed, NO flavoring, very bland. I paid over $30 for 2 people. 
Carne asada burrito, carne asada quesadilla, side of rice, chips and guacamole (yuck, I couldn't finish it because I wanted to throw it all up), and 2 drinks. The charge extra to take out the beans but I was able to wrap my thumb and index around the entire burrito= way too small= way over price even if it was big enough. 

Over all I felt like I was nickel and dimed to death= definitely not worth the squeeze.
