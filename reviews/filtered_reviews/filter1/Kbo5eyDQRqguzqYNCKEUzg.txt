It was a Sunday AM at ~6:30 AM.
Place was empty.
Me = only customer.
Only positive was the service....and I question that because the server had to see the lack of quality on the plate that was set before me...and still left it.
So here is what my $20  bought me (includes tax and tip)...

Ordered Omelette Mexicali and a soda..
I do not know what was specifically wrong with the eggs, but they were not right.
I think the menu states three eggs...yeha right...unless they meant quail eggs.
Kind a watery on top of it. 
A "little" toss of cheese on top.

The pico on the plate was old. Seriously? I appeared to be the first customer of the day and they give me this old stuff? Yuk! 
The potatoes were disgusting. Ate two bites.  They were old, wrinkly and soggy.
They had a funny taste to them that I could not place. I almost had to use the air-sick bag on the plane when I was thinking "Why did I eat those?".
Oh..the toast was good with the packaged butter and jelly. 
They are NOT getting any more of my money...ever.
I am OK paying airport process for food, but if it is disgusting like this then shame on them!!! 

Please go out of business so another place can have a shot at that spot.
