This place is one of those establishments that could flourish with the right management. Unfortunately, it seems that management is 100% incompetent. I've had so many bad experiences here that I couldn't even begin to get into them. If you sit inside, good luck. You won't get served for at least 15 minutes, if they even notice you're there. Service is always horrific. The food is below par. On one occasion I came here with a group of friends and we had to show our IDs at the door. Once inside we got our drinks and headed outside.
I had a big security guy following me around and finally he came up to me and asked to see my ID. I was so confused. Didn't I just show my ID at the door? How could I have gotten in if they checked ID's at the door??? He was extremely rude and spent a good solid 60 seconds staring at my ID and turning it over and over. Then handed it back to me and walked away... What? Anyways.. This place can be fun if you want to drink with friends outside. Just don't expect decent service !
