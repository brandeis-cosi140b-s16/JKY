Nice atmosphere, and nice decor... But, worth the price? I don't think so. 
They charged 4 dollars (50 cents per person) for water... WTF? My buddies ordered water, and they charged that for tab water? Bogus if you ask me. 

Another thing, we asked if we can be seated outside, but the lady at the front desk ignored us and said sorry, you table is here. She didn't even bother to answer the question or tell us that theirs no available space. I didn't like the attitude at all. 

Food? Decent! $20+ for Kobe Beef Taco? First of all, fake Kobe Beef... Tasted exactly like American beef. The same thing can be found at Taco Bell for $0.99 cents when they are on promotion. Why spend $20+?

I wouldn't come here...
