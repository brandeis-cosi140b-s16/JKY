My friends and I are in Arizona for the first time for a football tourney, so we hit this place to get some grub. never in my life will I ever come back here. The "jumbo" burrito is no where near that, Calling it TINY, is being nice. The burrito was tasteless and a waste of money. Food was horrible, the ID laws here suck, pretty much Arizona sucks in general! Cali over Arizona any day and twice on sundays!
