I ate at Blue Adobe with my family for my birthday on Sunday.  The service was very slow for one. I usually can be okay with that however when they brought out our food I was handed a dish I did not order. I immediately told the server that this was not what I had ordered and the server proceeded to argue with me stating that I had actually ordered what I did not. I have never had anyone argue with me over such a thing.  It would have made things a whole lot better if the server had simply apologized but no apologie was made by her. Then, when the server found out it was my birthday, a cookie with ice cream was brought out.  The cookie was burnt in the middle (I have no clue how the just the inside was burned) and the burn smell was very aromatic and everyone I was with could smell it. Unfortunately I took a bite before realizing the cookie was basically charcoal on the inside so I left the restaurant with a bad, burnt taste in my mouth. At any rate, horrible service, horrible attitudes by the staff, and gross burned food.
