The bowl of salsa that came out had something strange in it (I was thinking a cilantro stem or something) so I fished it out. I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa. The waiter wasn't quite sure how to handle it and couldn't find a supervisor to help him out. With our stomachs turning from the thought of wire or other "extras" that may he included we decided it was time to go. I really wanted chips and salsa too.
