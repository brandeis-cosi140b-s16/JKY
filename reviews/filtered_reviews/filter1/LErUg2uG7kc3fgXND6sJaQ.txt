The customer service was absolutely appalling. The manager should be ashamed. I dont eat meat or dairy and the woman gave me a look like my food choices were ridiculous. They they mixed up my mom and my aunts order so neither of them got what they wanted. The assembly line is rushed and disoriented it made me feel stressed. While we were eating, my aunt asked a  woman where the spoons were so she could feed her baby. The woman scoffed and pointed to the spoons. She was standing right by them and we were sittibg down eating! Instead of grabbing one for a BABY. she tried walking away but i asked her to grab one she rolled her eyes and slamed a chair down and yelled at my aunt saying do you want a fork too?! In a sarcastic tone. Sorry i went on a rant here. If you want crappy mexican food just go to taco bell because at least they will be nice to you.
