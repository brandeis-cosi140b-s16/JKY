It was horrible! I ordered a classic steak burrito and it was the worst I've had in my life!  The meat was so dry and burnt it was crunchy... I can still taste the bitter burnt meat 15 mins after I threw it away... Never going there again.

If I had enough time to complain I would have... Unfortunately my flight was here...
