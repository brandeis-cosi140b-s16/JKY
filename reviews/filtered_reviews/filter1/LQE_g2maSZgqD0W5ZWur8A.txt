We were wanting Mexican food and this place was located in the hotel where we were staying....ideal we thought.  It was absolutely terrible!!!  Service was bad and food and drinks totally over-priced.  I got a chicken chimi and the chicken was spoiled.  I took one bite and literally gagged.  My husband is a chef and smelled it and immediately knew it was rotten.  I lost my appetite so did not re-order.  Husbands tacos were tasteless. They did not charge us for my meal but our bill still totaled $50.  A total disaster!!
