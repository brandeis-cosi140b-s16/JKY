This was my fourth time in Las Vegas and while I've been here before, this will definitely be my last time visiting Diablo's, especially after their service (we were there Thursday, May 10). The food is OK, but like other people have said, "nothing to write home about" and the drinks while tasty, are definitely watered down. Our waitress came pretty quickly, was very nice and took our orders but went MIA when we needed another round or needed to ask her for more napkins.

My boyfriend and I finished our food and tried to order another round but we simply could not get ANY waitress' attention. After what seemed like forever, a second waitress came and brought us our bill without us asking for it and just dropped it on the table. At this point, we were so annoyed, we figured let's just leave and go somewhere else.

Well, it didn't end there... we paid the bill and walked out because we (AGAIN) could not find a waitress to give it to. At the doorway, a third waitress grabs my arm and gives me a nasty look and said, "hey did you pay?"... I was in shock... all i could do was nod yes, point at the table and walk away. That was the icing on the cake and that's why Diablo's will never see me again.
