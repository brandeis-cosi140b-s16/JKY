The just alright: 
After a 14+ hour work day, we came here to get a quick meal before bed.  I wasn't too hungry, so I just ordered chips and guacamole.  The guac was serviceable and had a bit of a spicy bite to it.  Another coworker got the stuffed chile relleno, which she didn't even eat half of (said it wasn't all that great).  

The very bad: 
My other coworker got food poisoning after eating here.  He was up for hours later that evening puking his guts out.  (I'm pretty sure he got the carne asada.)

The moderately bad:
This is a really annoying place to eat if you just want peace and quiet.  We were seated "outside on the patio" which really means "inside the building but they painted the ceiling to look like you're outside."  The gondolas go right by you, which I suppose could be a touristy thing to see, but it's painful when you've been working all day and someone boats by 2 feet away shout-singing in your ear.

All in all, I"d never go back here.
