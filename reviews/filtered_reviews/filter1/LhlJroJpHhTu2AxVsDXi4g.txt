Eastern location: Completely disappointed. We heard lots of great things about this place so we decided to give it a try.... food was bland and not worth the money, they don't offer chips and salsa as a starter, kid's food was forgotten, no refills, and the waitress was nonexistent and had zero personality and didn't bother asking if we wanted appetizers or a dessert at the end then proceeded to tell us we didn't qualify for the costume discount cause kid wasn't in a costume (which we had no idea there was such a thing).... guess we looked like we couldn't afford the bill .. also, almost no customers and tons of employees standing around so there was no reason to be completely ignored...
