I don't know what the attraction with this place is, The food was terrible it was low quality food. I order guacamole and it was over salted probably to disguise the fact that the avocados were bad  and the nachos where heavily deep fried with oil dripping of them. I ordered  a burrito and asked the waitress if it was really spicy she told me no, well that was the biggest lie I just think she wanted to see me in pain sicko. I can normal handle spicy but this was to much  i was sweating my nose was running and my mouth was on fire half way threw it I felt an overwhelming urge to throw my brains up had to run to the bathroom. After I ran out of there I went home and threw up some more and went to sleep the next morning I had really bad stomach pains and diarrhea for about 2 hrs lets just say I lost about 20 lbs, so if anyone is thinking about going here eat at your own risk. All these people saying its great I don't understand maybe its because they are drunk I don't drink so its all about the food with me and in my book failing miserably.
