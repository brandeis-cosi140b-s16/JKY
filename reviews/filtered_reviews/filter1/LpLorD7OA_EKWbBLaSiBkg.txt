A 12 oz. of Dos Equis for $8? The only reason we went here was to meet some friends who were staying in the Flamingo. I told the bartender the last time I paid that much for a beer was when I was drinking a craft beer. It was a Ballast Point Sculpin to be exact. Then I asked him why this bar does not offer more selection than Coors, Budweiser, Corona and Dos Equis and he said most people prefer these beers. Really? The only reason they prefer these beers is due to the lack of selection at this place and other places on The Strip. I told him he should offer craft beer to differentiate this place from other places. Apparently he was not open to the suggestion. With that attitude and way of thinking,  I will be shocked if this bar is still around when I return to Vegas. Adios Carlos' n Charlie's.
