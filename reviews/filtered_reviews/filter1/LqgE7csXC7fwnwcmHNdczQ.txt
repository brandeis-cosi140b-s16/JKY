This review is only for the night club. 

Don't fall for the $10 cover with bracelet scam. Its $20  with or without the bracelet. Also they advertise it as a rooftop bar, but there is no access to it on a Saturday night. 

The club is typical: blasting rap music remixes, with a rowdy crowd and overpriced drinks. Hella creepy guys that try to isolate girls from groups. Nothing special here. Not coming back.
