Ate here this weekend and what a disappointment! I used to come here with co-workers all the time and our experience was always a good one. Now mind you, this place is essentially a take out joint. So, I went to the take out section of the restaurant where they also have tables and ordered my meal. I couldn't help but a notice a VERY LARGE glass enclosed "tip" container.  I was instantly put off, but decided to save my overall opinion for after my meal arrived. I ordered my food from a young woman who not only failed to greet me, but seemed very annoyed to have to come to the counter and wait on me.  (I asked to "dine in" but you still have to order at the counter and pick it up at the counter. Nobody waits on you.) So I placed my order and waited. The cheese crisp was so burnt in sections I couldn't eat it, and the salsa they gave me was so watery I stopped putting it on my chips because it was making them soggy.  The taco was good. The overall experience was not good though, and the tip jar at the counter really blew my mind. That's like tipping at McDonald's. TACKY!!! What the hell happened to this place? I guess the owners just don't care anymore. Won't be back.
