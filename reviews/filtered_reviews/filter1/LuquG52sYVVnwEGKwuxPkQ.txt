The food is exotic and tasted ok , however it didn't come out well on the other end.  I spent over 140 dollars to get food poisoning from this overpriced restaurant that has such poor hygiene.  The bathroom was filthy which makes me wonder what could be lurking in the kitchen.  Bring your own sanitation napkins if you go here.  Where is the food inspector?
