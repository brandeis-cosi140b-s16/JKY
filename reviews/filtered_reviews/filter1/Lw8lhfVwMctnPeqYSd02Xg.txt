26 years in business? i dont see why!  I went to lunch there the other day.
First the water was cold and ice was clean
Restaurant was very clean and airy.
Not many people there for lunch 3 tables out of 30???.
The waitress was attentive and very professional
I give this place one star for the above.
The salsa was like they opened a can of Hunts tomatoes and threw a few spices in, NO taste at all
The chips were decent but the bottom of the basket were all crumbs ( little tensy wency  crumbs)
I ordered enchaladas , one cheese and one chicken bascally tastless and grease running all over the place.  O had the sauce on the side.  The red was ok, but I didnt say Ole!!!
The taco shells were hard as rocks and uncuttable
The little salad was very fresh with nice veges not BUT not on a blistering hot plate.  The dressing was one of those ones you dont have to shake, its in a  permanent suspension, which means NO oilve oil.
17.50 for two peopleand Bell no drinks, water.
This place would NOT last 10 days in Scottsdale.  Oh well, Try Valley Luna if you are on I-17/Bell area its always crowded but great.  This is an-biased review.  They need to clean up their act.  Quality counts, if they want to be around 26 more years.
