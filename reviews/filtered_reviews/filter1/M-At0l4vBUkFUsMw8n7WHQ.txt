i dined at Mundo's last night and while the premises were quite nice and the food good, the experience was so bad that i will not go back.  although we had reservations, we were placed at a back table in a back room next to a locked door and another door that led to the outside (alley or the like).  the music was so loud we thought we were in a night club and the base pounding was completely unsuitable.  when we asked whether it could be lowered, it was made louder.  when it came time for a check it took 15 minutes.  the staff was rude and condescending, leaving me to feel as if they were doing me a favor.  whereas most good restaurants are all amount the experience, this folks could have cared less.   I WILL NOT RETURN.
