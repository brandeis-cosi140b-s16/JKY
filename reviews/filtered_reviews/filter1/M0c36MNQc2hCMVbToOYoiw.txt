I'm sad to write this because I love the drinks here. I have always gone to Saltys in the other locations and after moving to glendale, this one is not far from me so I've gone twice now and each time got worse. The first time it seemed like we were in the way of social hour for the wait staff and this time even though they were open and it was happy hour we could only get house margaritas as the machine hasn't been prepared for customers. The bartender was the only wait staff on duty and he was put out to have to even talk to us, after one drink we couldn't get out of there quick enough. They are not usually busy there so you would think they would take all the free time they have to service the customers that are there that give them a paycheck.
