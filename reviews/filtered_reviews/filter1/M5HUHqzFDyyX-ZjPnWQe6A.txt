"I will read Yelp reviews before every dining experience, I will read...."
Made a last minute decision to stop in for a drink and a bite before a show at the Arizona Broadway Theatre next door.  Bad call.  Place was dirty--had to ask for a table wipe after we sat down.  Ordered "table side guac" which arrived already made up. Okay.   Salsa was grainy and more interesting and flavorful than most runny tomato salsas, so saved the zero star rating.  Tortilla chips were stale.  Margaritas were meh:  mine was frozen;  wife's on the rocks--have had many better.    We split a chile rellanos dinner--not being a Mexican fan I thought it was tasteless, but my wife liked it.  Learned my lesson:  don't ever even think about eating without studying Yelp first!
