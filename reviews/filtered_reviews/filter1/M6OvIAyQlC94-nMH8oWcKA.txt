A STEP FROM TACO BELL!  If you enjoy mediocre food, unattentive service and watered-down drinks; but at ten times the price, then this is the place for you. You can get this food at Taco Bell. The server agreed to the comparison, admitting this place was very Americanized. You can get the same stuff at your fast food place. I don't recommend this place. What a disappointment, especially from a restaurant on the strip.
