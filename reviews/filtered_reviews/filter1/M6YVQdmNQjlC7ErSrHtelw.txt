I wish there was only a half of start; because I would put that. And here's why: 

Asked for a Paloma but the bartender said 'that's tequila and grape juice.... You can do better.... I'll make you something' ten minutes later he comes back with a glass that has a hint of something orange in it with the taste of pure vodka. I told him I liked fruity drinks and I get straight liquor.  We got our order, waited five minutes to get silverware and by that time my six shrimp that were in my flour tortilla (too bad I ordered corn tortillas) were cold. The rice was dried out, the beans were straight from the can with a little Parmesan cheese on top. I watched the male bartender throw ice across the bar length wise hitting some guests sitting at the bar. Then I proceeded to watch him make a mix drink and right when he strains the drink; he uses his fingers to cover the mouth of the container and use his fingers as a stopper for the ice. My experience was terrible. The bartender said right before he gave us our check 'should I get my manager over here for you so you can bitch more about me?' I replied ' ya, that'd be nice!' Good luck with this place. And good luck if Dustin is your bartender/ waiter/ or whatever his part time job requires him to do.
