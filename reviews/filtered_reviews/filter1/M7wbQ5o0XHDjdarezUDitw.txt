With "Mexican food made by Mexicans" being their tagline I had high expectations for the food. Walking in you'll see a big menu written out on a large chalkboard. The menu is so big with such small writing that its hard to decipher. I ordered a fish burrito which was far from Mexican. The burrito was filled with mediocre fish and coleslaw. Coleslaw?? Had the place been advertised as a fusion food joint, I would have expected an interesting concoction such as this, but wanting Mexican food, I was sorely disappointed with what I ate.
Also, the meal came with a side of very few tortilla chips and enough salsa for two chips (no exaggeration).
