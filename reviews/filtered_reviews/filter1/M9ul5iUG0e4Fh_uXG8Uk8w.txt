We used to go to Macayo's at least 2 times a month, but since moving to a different area of the Valley, we have been going to different places when we went out to eat. Today we decided to go back...and were very disappointed. While the staff was friendly and helpful as usual, the food was a disappointment...it was bland, not very warm, and didn't live up to their previous standards. The menus we were given had dried food on them, the booth seats throughout were cracked and parched with tape, and the table tops were sticky. The interior is just dated, dusty and old looking. And restrooms....! While the toilets appeared clean, the walls and stalls looked like they had NEVER been cleaned-- streaks and drips of 'something' all over them.  Needless to say, the ENTIRE place needs a massive makeover and cleaning. I think others feel the same because there were only 3 other tables of people when we were there when they are usually 2/3 full. Doesn't look like we'll be going back unless they clean up their act!
