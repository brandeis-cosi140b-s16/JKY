Never again!  I had two margaritas.  The first was a banana margarita that had no flavor.  The second was a coconut margarita that had three live, decorative ants.  Of course, I did not drink it.  The chilaquiles were made with tortilla strips!!!  Worst of all, the food was nearly flavorless.  The restaurant itself is decorated nicely and the staff are friendly.  After confirming the ants in my drink, management comped my meal.  Never again will I set foot on this place.
