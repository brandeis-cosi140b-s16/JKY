Went for Easter Brunch to try the unlimited small plates. Most of the plates came out lukewarm, were supposed to be served to order but were a major disappointment! The "breakfast fries" with a sunny side egg were scrambled... There was no jalape√±o bacon on the smoked salmon slider, and the list goes on... The dessert bar had what tasted like day old cinnamon buns and an unidentifiable cake.... The best thing was the bread basket containing banana bread and guava pastries. We will not be back anytime soon....
