The kids were starving and wanted some Mexican food, and we were right there, so we decided to give Dona Maria another try. We could have gone to Roberto's and been much, much happier.

I have no idea has this place has any favorable ratings. We ordered four entrees and none of them were any good at all. I hate to be brutal here, but it just plain sucked. The one bright spot would be the abondigas soup that was ok. Green enchiladas, chicken mole, even the arroz y frijoles weren't any good. My wife is never a complainer about food, but she couldn't even eat the green enchiladas with chicken. The green sauce was way too salty and the chicken was overcooked to the point of being cat food.

I am a huge supporter of family businesses, but I would advise you to steer clear of this place.
