Forty-five minute wait on two out of four steak tacos that were ordered.. The other two weren't placed by our server, so that was another, exactly, 45 minute wait.  The first two that came out, which my husband let me have because I was starving, were so chewy and way over-cooked.  The next two tacos were burnt.  The rest of our party was also dissatisfied with their food.. One had beef sliders, so burnt and tough.  Another had the shrimp & mango burrito which was just a soggy mess.  And the beer was delivered fast but if you wanted water.. forget about it.. literally took 30 minutes after asking the guy maybe 8 times.  Will not be going back EVER!
