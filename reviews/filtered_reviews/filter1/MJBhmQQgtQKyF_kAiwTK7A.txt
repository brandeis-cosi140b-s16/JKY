BUG in my food!  WTF!!  

I was here with a friend November 2011.  We were staying at HardRock anyway - so we stopped in here for dinner.  Our food came and we started eating- I WAS EATING when I noticed a weird spot on my rice - then I looked closer and it was some kind of BUG!  It was super small (still a BUG) and had tiny wings.  It was like pale greyish brown.  I was shocked!!  It was freaky, I couldn't figure out what it was!    Inside the panic and adrenaline was running!

I frantically looked around - cant everyone is this restaurant see this?!  It took a few LONG minutes to flag the waitress down - then I showed her.  She looked at me, looked at the food and said very loudly "SHUT-UP" (not rudely - but in an OMG - you have got to be kidding me)  she snatched up the plate and went toward the kitchen.  Im watching her like.. now what?  Finally I got up and went to go find her - where she was still lingering by the kitchen window - and i swear they were all smiling and getting a good chuckle out of this.  I told her we were leaving.  I double checked to make sure it was ok that we didn't have to pay for our meals or drinks - and she shrugged her shoulders and said it was fine.  When there is a living bug on your food - there are hundreds in the kitchen!  ADIOS Pink Taco.
