I've never felt as unwelcome in a restaurant as I did last night at Gallo Blanco. 

My friend Dixon and I were participants in a mass bike ride through town called Critical Mass. The organizer has an arrangement with the Clarendon Hotel, which is the location for Gallo Blanco. As far as we knew, it was mutually understood that the cyclists were welcome to come by after the ride, grab a drink and use the pool.

From the moment we walked in, the GM was all over the two of us. I should make it clear that neither of us have anything to do with organizing the event. It was almost as if he thought we were trying to "pull one over on him" when we repeatedly told him we were not organizers and thought everything was agreed upon in advance.

Honestly I'm not sure what difference it makes anyway, as we were just like any other patron, dressed normally and wanted to get a drink from the bar. Our mode of transportation should not have made any difference at all. He said "this is my restaurant" to us, as if we were not wanted there.

The GM could sense my annoyance, even though he was interrogating Dixon. He looked over and offered to buy us a drink "when this all gets sorted out." He then pointed us over to the corner and told us to "just wait over here." I can understand not wanting a chaotic scene in a dining room, but this was insulting. The GM never returned to tell us he had spoken to "our leader."

After a few minutes of standing around in the corner, we went to the bar to order drinks. While ordering, the GM walked up, but said nothing. He did not make good on his promise to buy a drink for our troubles, which wasn't really surprising.

I wish I had even one thing nice to say about this venue because I'm sure under different circumstances, it would have been a good experience. 

I doubt I will be driving or biking to Gallo Blanco any time in the future.
