First off, we walked in and the place reeked.  It was an absolutely gross smell.  Nothing else around open so we went ahead and ordered a couple of  two cheese enchilada meals.  Imagine getting your tastebuds ready for oooey gooey melty cheese enchiladas and getting them home and finding two tortillas filled with shredded cheese that was unmelted, and with unmelted cheese on top.  No way to heat them up because we're moving.  All because the cook was too lazy to put them in another container, heat them up and then put them into the styrofoam containers.  Why can't anyone just do their jobs anymore????
