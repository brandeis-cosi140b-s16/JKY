I wish I could rate this place one star!!


Food was not so great - in fact it was HORRIBLE!  The ribs were tuff and hard to chew. The seafood, which my wife ordered tasted old and over cooked. I understand the atmosphere of this place and I totally get it - but this place should have food that is decent....however; during our meal, they were doing some contest and they kept on demanding everyone to join in. We declined since we just got our meals but they kept on pointing at us to stand up and join, which I felt was very rude.

This place is overpriced......
