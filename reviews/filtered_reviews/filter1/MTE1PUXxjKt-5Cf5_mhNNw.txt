The evening I came here I was craving Mexican food BADLY! I wanted something in the area where I was staying so unfortunately Paradise Cantina was the nearest and I sadly set foot into this "mexican food place"/bar... Ahh if only i didn't!!!! 

The food was disgusting I ordered a Taco Salad and that should be good no matter where you go, um not at this place really, my dad ordered a burrito and he was disappointed as well, nothing even resembling to tasty traditional mexican food, it was more like fast greasy frozen food that has been sitting in the back, yuck. I could of had Taco Bell or one of those fast food chains, cuz if I did my tummy wouldn't of been sick a week after eating that food. My dad is a big bear drinker, usually always orders draught beer, he said that this place probably hasn't even cleaned their pipes for years, the beer was flat no taste to it at all, and yea I trust him cuz my dad always leaves his glass empty always asking for another glass, but not this time I guess?!

I strongly recommend that Paradise Cantina betters in their kitchen, maybe hires an actual cook that makes fresh food and also try's better in customer service. The servers are very rude, it takes them forever to take your order and their attitude is not pleasant at all, they have no clue what's on the menu, when you ask them questions about the food they have no clue or they don't even try explain.. I'd also say it would be best if Paradise Cantina could try manage the place better all together it could be better, you guys are only lucky right now because tourists like me don't know what they are stepping into, but I don't really thinks locals would go there, the place right now is just junk all together.

Funniest thing outside the place there is a HUGE banner saying they are the #1 mexican place, and its even been awarded, umm idk think that's true honestly...  Sorry guys I really hope you improve somehow...
