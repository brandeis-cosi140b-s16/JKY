I was there today with my brother, who had fond memories of Macayo's from Arizona.  It was awful.  The food was INEDIBLE.  It tasted like something that would make you ill later if you actually ate it.  The first sign was the chips & salsa.  Chips ok - salsa looked like bottled taco sauce, very smooth and not chunky.  I ordered some kind of chimichanga with shredded beef - it tasted really bad, like it had gone off.  The atmosphere is a little run-down and the booths are kind of saggy and too far from the tables - like they get a lot of super fat people in there.  The food servers were very nice, so I feel bad for them to have to work in a place like that.  I wouldn't recommend this place at all.  Gross.
