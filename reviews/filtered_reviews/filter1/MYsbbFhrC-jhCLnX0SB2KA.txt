I have lived in New Mexico for 10 years. This restaurant food can some how match up to what the authentic New Mexican food would be. The Green Chile stew is a bet salty though. The one star unfortunately goes to the service. We came there as a group of 10-12. Two members came in late. The staff charged them for the food, but little after 8 when they closed, we got kicked out while they were eating. The point is either stop serving after certain point if you know you are closing and need to clean, or if you serve people food and charging them, let them finish the food in peace. The restaurant owner's wife is rude and not accommodating. The whole hospitality in this restaurant was not desirable. Unless you place an order  "To Go", I would not recommend this restaurant for dinging and having a good time as the owners and staff will not give it to you.
