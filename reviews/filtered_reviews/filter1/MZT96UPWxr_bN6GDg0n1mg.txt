If I could give this place zero stars I would. I walked up to the outside bar with my friend and had to greet our bartender "Kush" since he clearly had no interest in assisting us. When asked about happy hour drinks he was extremely standoffish. Once we received our margaritas the bill came to $16 for 2 (2 for 1)  but their margaritas are watered down & definitely not worth the money. After sitting here for 30 minutes & noticing how friendly "Kush" was to other patrons the only common denominator was that we were African American & everyone else he greeted & checked in on was White. He didn't even look at us one time! Sitting with two empty cups at a bar & not being asked how was it, do you need anything else, or anything at all is not something you get from this place. Definitely bring your money elsewhere.
