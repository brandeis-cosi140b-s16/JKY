1 - There were bars on the windows
2 - The inside smelled like urine
3 - A homeless guy came in and tried to steal my food

I can get past the ambiance, a lot of hole in the wall places actually have good food. I ordered the beef enchilada platter. I am about 85% certain the meat was not beef but rather dog or possibly a horse. Instead of red or green sauce they used some kind of brown gravy. The rice and beans were just a step below what you would find in a tv dinner.
