I have been going to Sylvia's since it first opened in the 80s in the old gas station.  I lived on their chorizo for years.  Have been out of Phoenix for several years and found my way back there last night.  What a difference.  The last time I ate there, I had one of the best meals I have ever eaten.  Last night was horrible.  They have killed all the ambiance the restaurant had.  You don't order at the window now and they took out all of the walls and made a big barn of the place with too many tables crammed in.  No charm whatsoever.  No care either.  They have a beautiful chandelier over the hostess desk and all but one of the light bulbs is burned out and covered with dust.  Really nobody notices??? It would be comical if it wasn't so sad.  I can only guess our waitress is someone's daughter.  No idea how to serve a table or interact with a customer.  I ordered a Chimichanga with guacamole and sour cream on the side.  Of course it all came piled on top.  "Well that isn't how I gave it to the kitchen was the response."  She did offer to take it back but at that point it had been too long already.  It was mostly tasteless and not worth the calories.  My wife got a simple open face cheese crisp.  For $5.99 she got a tortilla the size of a Taco Bell tostada with cheese.  Do you really feel good serving that?  Sat there the entire evening with an empty water glass.  No clue at all.  The $4 Corona Light on tap was tasty as were the chips and salsa.  It might be worth it to go back and drink beer and eat chips and salsa on the patio but probably not.  I am afraid my 25 year history with Sylvia's is now over.  I will read future reviews but absent something positive, I won't be back.
