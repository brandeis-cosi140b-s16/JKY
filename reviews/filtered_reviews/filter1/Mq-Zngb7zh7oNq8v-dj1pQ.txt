I'm a sucker, I've eaten here twice - the food isn't actually THAT bad - my chicken quesadilla was crisp, and the salsa fresh, but the service and the chaos in this place is pretty bad.  I actually sat at a dirty table for fifteen minutes waiting to be acknowledged while waitresses buzzed around me.  When I flagged one like, desparate to have my table cleaned and order, she said, "this isn't my table."  okaaaaaay.  the C gate area sucks for food choices, you either have fat-city specials like Pizza Gut, or this place.  mmm, what about a Nathan's hot dog??  that idea is free.
