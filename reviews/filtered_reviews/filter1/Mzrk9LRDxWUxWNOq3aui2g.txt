I order the steak fajitas made a big mistake with that. 16$ of a couple of steak strips and it was not even sizzling when they brought it out.  They put lettuce in there as well. What do you do when you heat up lettuce it wilts.  Thought it would come with home made tortillas nope taste like store bought.  The beans were also bland. Not a fan of this place at all. Maybe might try this in the distance future but won't be ordering the fajitas.
