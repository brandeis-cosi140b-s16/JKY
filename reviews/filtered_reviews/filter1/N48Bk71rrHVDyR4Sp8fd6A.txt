They probably should just cut out the food menu. The chimichangas were made with what tasted like marinara sauce, and came with no sides which is impressive for being 8 dollars. I'm also sure the "award-winning salsa" was accredited by the same place that gave the "world's greatest coffee" sign to the coffee shop in Elf. At least I got to see a short bar fight.
