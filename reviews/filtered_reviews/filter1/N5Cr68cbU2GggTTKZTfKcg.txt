This place was ridiculously overpriced. 

We had reservations to Ka at 9:30 on Saturday and before the show we decided to stroll the MGM grand to find a nice place to eat. My date wanted some Margaritas and we saw this place so we decided to give it a shot. When we were seated the server came and gave s a menu and we couldn't believe the prices,  $14 for a taco salad with either shredded beef, shredded chicken, or pork. I asked the server how much would it cost to upgrade to carne asada and he said $6, so I told him that I would keep looking at the menu and he gave me a disgusted look, My date saw the prices on the tequila shot and they were ridiculous, I know shots can be pricey but this place was over the top we could of walked to the liquor store and bought a whole bottle of cabo wabo for the price of one shot of cabo wabo uno.  They gave us chips and salsa, the salsa was not bad but the chips were stale and hard, so far I was not impressed,  We settled for appetizers instead we ordered the chimi surprise which were 3 mini chimis which was ok, my date had the street tacos which were passable at best and for that it was nearly $30. I am used to authentic Mexican food and this place is not that, I would of been better off eating at Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, which can be pricey but at least the food would be worth it. This place is for sure a fail .
