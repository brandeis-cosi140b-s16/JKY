High prices, slow service. 
15 bucks for a pollo poblano burrito with fries. Choice of salad or fries. After 15 min of waiting, I received my burrito with a salad. So I asked for my fries. They simply scraped the salad off the plate and plunked fries on top of the balsamic mess. My burrito was soggy, mediocre amount of chicken, and the vinegar taste was strong. Another thing I didn't like was that if you order takeout you cannot sit in the seating area. Dine in only. It's an airport. I don't have time to wait for someone to bring me a check when I'm trying to catch a plane. I'm not stopping here again. Pizza Hut probably would've been worth the walk...another note, the drinks in the cold case were warm so they had a bucket on the counter with ice. This ensured colder drinks but it was crowded and I almost pulled a muscle trying to lean over to get the drippy water on the other end of the counter.  I don't understand why the cashier couldn't have just handed me one as she saw me struggle. Just a negative experience all around. :(
