This place has gone way down hill from the last time I ate here. I came here with my mom about 2 months ago for dinner at around 5:30ish. It was pretty busy but not over ally crowded. We got seated right away which was nice but had to wait about 5 minutes before our waiter came to our table. After getting our drinks and ordering our food we had to wait a good 30 minutes before our food came out. I ordered the 'chicken tacos al carbon' and immediately my order was wrong. I asked for corn tortillas and got flour. I also asked for a side of guacamole but got sour cream instead? Okay I like sour cream but would like what I ordered. I had to wait another 5 minutes for someone to come by so I could tell them the 2 things they messed up and then had to wait another 10 minutes just for my food to me corrected! My mom's food came out cold and after mine came out the correct way it was cold. Needless to say we ate dinner at home because the food was not worth eating. The only good thing was the drinks and chips and salsa. The manager didn't even come over to say anything about what happened and we still had to pay the bill for full price which was WAY overpriced. This place used to be so good but has gone downhill fast. I won't be coming back here probably for a while unless they change up the way their service is.
