Went for lunch with 5 of the girls. I was hoping that this would be one of those mexican food places that had kept the food tasty even after all the good cooks were run out of AZ by Apairo and his gang of thugs. Since this was my first time here I don't have anything to compare the taste too, but they only get 1 star for a reason....I couldn't give them no stars. The place was packed at 11:30 on Good Friday so the service was slow, but I expected that. What I didn't expect was the blandness of the food, not just 1 item, but everything we ate. It started with the chips and hot sauce (anyone heard of El Pato sauce?). When asked if they had anything hotter or spicier, the answer was no. When asked by one of the girls which was hotter, the red or green sauce the answer was neither. As Judge Judy would say, "Get where i'm going with this?" I ordered a cheese crisp, it came out as a cheese limp. One of the girls ordered a side of guacamole. She said it had more sour cream in it than avocado. None of the food was seasoned. Then to add insult they added 18% gratuity to a party of 6! We left and won't make the long trek back. Bill Clinton has left the building and probably won't be back. Save yourself a disappointing experience and go to La Pinata instead.
