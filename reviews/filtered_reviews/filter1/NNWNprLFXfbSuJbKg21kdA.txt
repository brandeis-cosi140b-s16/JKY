This is where size 0 models come to eat.


I came here for a friends birthday because he really likes the Alambre Tacos (grilled skirt steak, bacon, Oaxaca cheese & chile poblano) which we all ordered because he said it was really great. For $16 you get 3 mini tacos = 1.5 normal tacos, side of rice (dry and oily), black beans (bland and they don't spend the 2 cents to put cheese on top). Not a hearty traditional Mexican meal by any stretch of the imagination. Thank god we ordered the $10 quacamole to go with our chips (which were really good!) or we still would've been hungry. 

Our server was high or something- he didn't pay attention to us and constantly forgot things. I ordered a Mango Ginger Margarita five minutes later our meal came and 20 minutes later my drink came- when we were done eating- seriously? Then he hands it to my friend cause it had been so long he forgot who ordered it. I told him I changed my mind (because I wanted it with my meal) and he didn't offer to comp me the drink or apologize for how long it took. Lame- cuz the drink sounded good.

So if you wanna blow $120 on meager hit and miss food for 4 people including 1 margarita, 1 beer, and 1 iced tea you are in the right place at T & T, OR, you can pay me and I'll make you a Mexican banquet included 4 margaritas for $120. I'll even bring your drinks so you can have them WITH your food!

Had the service been good though- the loud techno music, and pricey food wouldn't have been as big of a deal at all.
