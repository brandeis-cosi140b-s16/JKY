Bad, bad, bad.  Moved to the Valley from Tucson and based on many yelper's comments decided to try Nando's to get our Mexican food fix.  There was a line out the door and the place was packed.  We had high hopes.  Guacamole tasted like something purchased in a refrigerated section of the grocery store.  Salsa tasted like tomato sauce.  Neither my husband nor I could finish the food.  Bland, not the least bit authentic and downright gross.  Took the leftovers home to my teenage kids (they usually eat everything).  They took one bite and discarded the rest...citing that Taco Bell was more authentic.  My only assumption can be that those that have yelped have never experienced authentic Mexican food.
