I had high hopes, but stay away! I've been here twice hoping my first try was a bad night for them. As others have said, the staff is not experienced, not friendly, and almost pissy that they are working. 
We walked in and the bar tender just stared at me and my hub. A patron had to tell us to find our own seat. THEN...there was a shard of glass in my margarita. The manager handled it poorly. Blamed dishwasher?
The patio and decor are nice, but staff ruin it. Had to ask for every little thing...napkin,straw, silverware, etc. 
seriously needs improvement bf ill spend money there again
