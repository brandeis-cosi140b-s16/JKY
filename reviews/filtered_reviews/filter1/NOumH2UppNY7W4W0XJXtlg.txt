So this is the second time in a couple weeks I've taken the time out of my body day to stop off and grab a bite to eat. Its also the second time in a row now that the line to get served has extended quite some distance. I gave them the benefit of the doubt the first time round...

I've now been stood in June for 18 minutes and still have several people before me. 

I love eating here, but the time it takes to get served is ridiculous. Sad to day it, but I just won't bother stopping by here any more for lunch. There's just not enough time in the day to justify it. 

My advice to everyone, don't bother between 12pm and 1:30pm
