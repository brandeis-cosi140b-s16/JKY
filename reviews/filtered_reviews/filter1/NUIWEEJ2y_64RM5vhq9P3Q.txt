This place has gone majorly downhill in the last year. Everything from the hostess to the servers to the food to the bartender felt more like Denny's and less like The Mission. Service was terrible, food was ok, drinks were overpriced, and not strong. NEVER going back. Bad sign when the only patrons that are there are tourists and not locals. Tourists don't know any better. One visit wonders.
