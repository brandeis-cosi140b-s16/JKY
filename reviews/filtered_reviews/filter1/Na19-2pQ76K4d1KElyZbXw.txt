I wish there was an option for zero stars. We walked in and after a short wait were seated. The runner promptly greeted us and delivered chips and salsa. Chips were warm and there were two kinds of salsa. They both were fairly decent. That's where it ends. We sat for 15 minutes without a single person coming to our table. So we walked out. It's too bad because the menu looked promising. Apparently they need servers at this restaurant because there were none in sight.
