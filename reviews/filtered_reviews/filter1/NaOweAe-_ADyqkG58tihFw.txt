Very slow.  You have to be willing to spend sometime to get your burrito and when I got home my order was wrong.  Don't ask for salsa to-go without expecting to pay for it.  Make sure to have sometime to spend if you intended to eat at the place as well.  I would go to Los Taquitos down the street, much better service and timely food.
