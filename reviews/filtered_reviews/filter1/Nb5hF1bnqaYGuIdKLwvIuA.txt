Not sure where to start here. Nachos where great, though I'm thankful our server didn't carry them out, I think the shear weight of the plate alone just might crumble her scrawny malnourished frame. After I opened my eyes to more than the 40 ish tv's around I began to notice the Ethiopian malnourished look is a trend, along with the jersey shore huge upper body and tooth picks for legs. About lost my appetite at the site of the employees, I really wish I had. I ordered the Cx sandwich and the bread was great...  Cx average, the chipotle mayo I think was mixed wrong it was cloyingly sweet and not spicy at all. And the fries came to my table half mashed ( sooo soggy). As for the good a 5$ cover charge for UFC fight 185 not bad, however we had to bribe the manager to turn the horrid music off and play the fight!  
The drink specials... Well if a 3$ domestic draft is good then you are golden... That's full price at my restaurant/bar! So there was a bit of sticker shock when we got the bill! 

All in all, we might go back for another fight if friends want to go, but for the price we paid I could havemade filets and lobster, a bottle of skull, the comfort of my couch watching the same fight, and be in my pj's with my hubby!
