After my wonderful experiences at Los Olivos in South Scottsdale, I felt safe taking my in laws here without visiting prior. Bad decision on my part. This restaurant is a far cry from the Los Olivos I know. Terrible margaritas, food was bland, loud restaurant. I was embarrassed to bring my family here. Go to the original.
