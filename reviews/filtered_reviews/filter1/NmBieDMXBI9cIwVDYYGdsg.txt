I love watching cooking shows.  I had just moved to Las Vegas and my friend took me to Border Grill.  Everything I had from the beans, rice, and Shrimp were beyond over cooked.  I am from Houston and I grew up on Mexican food.  I have been all over Mexico and I have Hispancis in my professionan that can cook better.  I then went to a convention for healthcare and we once again met at Border Grill.  Every appertizer was not good.  They served some thick, thick, pastey that was not good and filled with serval different iems.  If I was the one paying for this I would demand my money back.
