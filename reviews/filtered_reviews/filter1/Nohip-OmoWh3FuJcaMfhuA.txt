I really wanted to like this place but it just didn't happen. 
First of all the girl @ the counter was very rude..she was a larger woman and I was just coming from the gym & in my workout outfit. She kind of rolled her eyes at me. I asked for a side salad..got a "noooo". Not sure why I didnt leave at that point..I ordered the fish tacos, sauce on the side. 
I got a very fried cod (not a fish I ever eat) square thing in a tortilla w loads of lettuce. The rice was not tasty and the beans were too fatty tasting. I ate a few bites and left. 
I guess when I think of fish tacos I'm thinking grilled fish, fresh salsa white rice black beans type . Maybe I'm just too much of a health foodie for phat phrank.
