Walked up to the hostess at 7:30 on a Saturday night. She wouldn't even put our name on the list and told us to come back at 9:30. WTF? There were about 5 empty tables on the patio. 

However, looking at the other reviews, I guess we dodged a bullet. (Not that our experience at Flour & Barley was any better.)

LINQ restaurants better get there sh*t together if they want to survive!
