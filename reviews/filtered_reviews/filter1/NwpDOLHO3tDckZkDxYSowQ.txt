Maybe this was an off day for Los Favoritos... but whatever the case I won't be giving it a second chance. Because of all the raving reviews for their breakfast burritos we decided to try them. I have never had a burrito more gross than the one I ate this morning. Stale tortilla, greasy potatoes, bland flavor. Everything was bland; the salsa, guacamole, beans. We were both so disappointed. It was like eating a flavorless brick.  The customer service was subpar as well. The lady at the front counter was rude to us and wouldn't even offer a smile or greeting. 

Again, maybe this was an off day but I was sorely disappointed. I want a burrito with flavor, freshness and excellent salsa. Phoenix, help me out- where does this exist??
