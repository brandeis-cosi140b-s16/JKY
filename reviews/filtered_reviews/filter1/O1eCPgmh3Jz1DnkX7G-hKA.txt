Don't have the words to express how disappointing this first and last visit was for me.

Most of the food we ordered was very light on meat.
The pastor burrito was small compared to other restaurants and had a cloves after taste, carnitas also tasteless, very unusual as was the rest of the food. The pics on here are deceiving. 
The flavors were mild to tasteless, not a typical taco stand. I think this place caters to the UNLV crowd, enough said.
Not a good value for the money.
Don't waste your time.
