So we yelp this place and saw that it had great reviews. We were craving carne asada tacos so we trusted the comments. As soon as we got in the facility, it was like a smoke house. You could hardly breathe. So we waited in line for about 10 minutes to find out that we were in the wrong line. Still trying to be positive, we got in a line that you could only order carne.  

We orders 6 carne asada tacos and carne fries. Not only did we pay about 26 bucks, the food tasted terrible. The meat was so hard and the tortillas were soaked with grease, we just left the food on the table for everybody to see. I was really surprised due to the reviews. Maybe it was just a bad day for us, but I don't think we will give it another chance.
