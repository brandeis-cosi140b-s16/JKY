Horrible, horrible, horrible!!! I took my Dad and his wife that were visiting from out of town and I felt so bad that the food was so tasteless. The waiter was super rude and slow. Then my Dad went to pay for the bill and he didn't realize until later that he had given them an expired credit card so the manager came over and was almost yelling at us saying the card was declined in her loudest voice saying she tried 3 times. Then my Dad paid with another card and we left to be chased down by the rude ass waiter saying my Dad didn't sign the bill when in actuality he did but the manager had taken the bill before the waiter seen it. We were all horrifies and humiliated the way we were ALL treated! So very disappointed. Never in all my life was I treated like a thief. I will never be back to this place again.
