This place is awful! First off we had a cross between a Voldemort and a ken doll  looking waiter that had cold, soulless eyes piercing down at you who was very rude! The food tasted meh. The soulless waiter got our order in a rude and mean tone and that's all. The busboy gave us a refill on chips and the some other person gave us our mediocre food. Don't come here!
