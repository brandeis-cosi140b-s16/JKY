its been 3 hrs since we ate at this place, and can still feel them stuck in my throat ... Carne azada too plain, big chunks of onion, salsa has no flavor, tables are claustrophobic small.  I heard people say that if you don't go eat tacos el Gordo in Vegas u don't fully experience Vegas... That's BS ... Well, I rather have McDonald's for breakfast next time .
