The food here was tasteless and SO oily!!!

My bf and I went here for some vegan tacos. What we got was flavorless and swimming in oil. We ordered the combo with several different vegan taco options. My bf didn't even eat a single taco, he just picked out a little filling and said he couldn't eat it. I attempted to eat one and was horrified when I looked down at my plate to realize there was a pool of oil under my food. So gross. We ate the plantain chips and threw all the rest of our food away.
