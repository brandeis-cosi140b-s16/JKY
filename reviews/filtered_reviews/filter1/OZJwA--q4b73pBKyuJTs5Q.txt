DISCLAIMER: this review doesn't have anything to actually do with the food or the service, but can be an interesting read for the culturally ignorant.

The food wasn't awful.  Inauthentic and disingenuine, yes, but it wasn't the food that even captured my attention.  It's the strange fusion decor really detracts from the mediocre fusion food.  How do you have flashing pictures of Chairman Mao next to the Dalai Lama, who is in fact Tibetan and heavily oppressed by the Chinese government? 

Actually read up on the history of China Poblana: "This is story of a young girl who was snatched from her home in India by Portuguese pirates and sold into slavery in the Philippines - and of the odyssey that took her half-way around the world, where her dress wound up starting a fashion craze...She's known as La China Poblana, roughly meaning "The Chinese Woman of Puebla (Mexico)." She wasn't Chinese, but in old-time Mexico, anyone or anything from Asia was tagged Chinese."

If you read the top portion of the menu explaining the significance of the restaurant's namesake, claiming that it was an homage to a Chinese girl kidnapped by pirates (possibly raped and assaulted) and forced to spend her life in Mexico and she was known as "China Poblano."

Sorry to say, but can't support a restaurant that capitalizes off historical inaccuracies, pictures of a dictator next to an oppressed religious monk, but then again it's Vegas where truth, content, and respect doesn't really matter.  

Whoever came up with the concept of the restaurant is either culturally retarded or a pecuniary jackass capitalizing off the culturally retarded.
