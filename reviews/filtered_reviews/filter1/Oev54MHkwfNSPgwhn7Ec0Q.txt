Do not eat here, service and flavors are lacking!

4/6 members of our party went with the restaurant week tasting menu. You either had too bland or salty. Timing was off on the tasting menu: 1 member had to wait 10-15 minutes for his 2nd dish and 3rd dish while the rest of us had our food. Dessert took at extra 30 minutes to come out. (For premade flan and tapioca pudding!) The pineapple garnishes came out of a can. 

Swallow a Cloud: bland broth, small portions, and mediocre wontons. We asked for a side of chili to enhance the flavor and was charged $3. 

"Recomended" noodle dish: too much vinegar! 

Yes, while vegas restaurants are pricey, flavor is expected.

Waters were not refilled on promptly. Servers incorrectly and rudely cleared the table while the party was still dinning. 

Save your money and eat elsewhere.
