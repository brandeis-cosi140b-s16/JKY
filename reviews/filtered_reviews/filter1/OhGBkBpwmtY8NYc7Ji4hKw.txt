Thinking a burger sounded just right, I stopped in here for dinner last night and ordered the Route 87 with lemonade.  The lemonade was fresh, but a bit tart for my preference.  The fries were great, and the burger was tasty.  HOWEVER, halfway through my meal, my boyfriend spotted a giant cockroach on the wall a foot away from me.  The waitress removed it, apologized, and comp'd my meal but heebie jeebies will keep me away from this place FOREVER.
