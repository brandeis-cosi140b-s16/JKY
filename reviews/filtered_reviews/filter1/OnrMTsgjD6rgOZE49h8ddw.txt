So.... I was very excited to eat at this place, I have only heard great things in other markets.  On a Saturday, the family and I were looking for a place to get some good food and watch some college football.  We walk in, and you order from the counter, not what I expected but I proceed. I order the fish taco plate, that's why I am here.  My husband orders the '3 Minute Burrito', and my kids order nachos, a steak taco and a fish taco.  $45 later, we get our number and take a seat.  We wait, and wait and wait for 28 minutes!!!  I get up to look for a manager or someone to assist me to get my food.  The runner speaks no English, neither does the kitchen staff.  Food finally arrives at the table.  It is only the 3 minute burrito, taking only 31 minutes. Then they bring the kids' plates.  The sides were wrong, the nachos looked like something I make in the microwave at home.  Not thrilled with the flavor profile of the fish taco, I have had better tacos at Rubios... (way better..) and for the service, price and cleanliness of the restaurant, I will not be going back.  People and businesses make mistakes all the time, but the lack of management, lack of knowledge of communication and the sheer expense with little to no ROI leaves me cold.  I don't mind spending the money if I am getting what I pay for.  Not the case here.  I hope this is not the rule with this place, but I will never know, I am not going back.
