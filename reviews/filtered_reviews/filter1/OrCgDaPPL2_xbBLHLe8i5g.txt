It looked promising from the outside but once you get seated god forbid the wait staff actually does their job. She took my drink away and never came back with a refill she would show her face once every maybe MAYBE 10 minutes and wouldn't even come to your table. 
The food was a different story. They have wonderful chips and salsa 
But their entrees absolutely suck. The rice was undercooked the meat was extremely fatty 
For 14 dollars for a burrito I expect more.
