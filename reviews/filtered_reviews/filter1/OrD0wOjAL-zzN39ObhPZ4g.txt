Worst restaurant of the trip, hands down. Loved the decor, but service was obnoxiously slow, and the food was no better than bland. We tried the tasting menu, and besides getting the order wrong, (I can only think it was my husband's accent meeting the server's accent and causing a train wreck) the food just wasn't enjoyable. I got the tacos el carbon, but all I could taste was the tortilla. I didn't like the Sangria but my husband did, but the drinks were watered down. Worse, my husband ordered a second Sangria and the glass was double the size of the glasses we received the first go-round, when the drink was a part of a fixed price menu. Count me extremely non-impressed.
