Very disappointed in the quality of food here. Carne Asada is supposed to be seared, not charred. Sent it back once, got it back the same way. Girlfriend got the ahi (tuna) tacos, got Scombroid food poisoning... 

Furthermore, our waitress had little to no clue about the items on the menu, and came once during the main course, despite working on silverware 5 feet away from my table.
