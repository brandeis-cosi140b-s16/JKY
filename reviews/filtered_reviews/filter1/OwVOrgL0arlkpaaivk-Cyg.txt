Food (chips & salsa, pulled chicken burrito, and fish tacos) 1/5:  you can get better fake cantina food at Wahoo's or even La Salsa.  Fir the price we paid, it was NOT at all acceptable.  The only saving grace was the so-so guacamole.

Drinks (Diablo's own brew) 2.5/5:  decent beer, but for $8.00?  The beer should come in a bigger mug.

My gf and I was there yesterday, and I have to say it was quite disappointing......

Service 1/5:  We got our chips, beers, and main course within acceptable time.  However, I never got the hot sauce I politely asked for.  After 15 mins, AFTER I am done with my burrito, our waitress still did not bring the hot sauce or even check in with us to see if we needed anything 

Overall, somewhat acceptable food, over-priced, and unacceptable service.
