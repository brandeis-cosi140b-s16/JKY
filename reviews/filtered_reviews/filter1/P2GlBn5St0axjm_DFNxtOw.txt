** do yourself a favor & don't eat at this location if you have any food allergies!

Party of 7 - I immediately spoke with our waitress re: my food allergies. 
My ceviche was sent back 3 times because of avocado! ( not listed on menu under ingredients) Hard to believe right? Server had no idea...the second attempt guacamole is under tostado! Server has no idea how the "fresh" ceviche is made. Then dinner was worse! After the second attempt the manager on duty came by to find cheese sprinkled on food and guacamole added to my tacos! She proceeded to take my dinner, once again. 40 minutes pass.... I waved her over and asked about my dinner,  she said: Oh! I just assumed you didn't want it!! Well... My entire party has eaten, my stomach is upset, and I haven't had dinner, not to mention, this was my birthday celebration! Horrible service & management staff. They never offered to comp anything on my bill! In Las Vegas there are too many options for incredible food & service - never again! Do yourself a favor a pick another Mexican restaurant! ( we were at this location seated for 3 hours ).
