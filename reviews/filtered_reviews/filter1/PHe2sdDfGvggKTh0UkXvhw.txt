wanted some Mexican food. Went along time ago to Roberto's and it was not bad that I couldn't do it again. But this spot on fort apache was horrible. Food tasted old like it been there all day. No flavor very greasy.  The only thing good was the pickled carrot and onions. Wasted 7.46 and the dam cashier don't speak English and if he did he looks at you like he don't understand and nods his head yes to every thing. Place was clean though. I will never trust Roberto's. Again my stomach hurt from the little I tried to eat. Just NASTY!!!!!!!!!!! SO GREASY!!!!!!!!
