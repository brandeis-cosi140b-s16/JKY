Made a special trip From the opposite side of the strip.  A friend said he had a great meal here when he tried it weeks ago.  Walked in and made my way to the bar where 3 bartenders were working.  I ordered the cucumber mint margarita which was very good and seemed to have a salted rim with a hint of cumin.  I usually hate cumin but this accentuated the flavor of the cocktail.  I looked at the food menu while I waited for my little lady to arrive.  She ordered the red sangria which tasted really watered down.  We found the queso fundido & two different ceviches that peaked our interest.  One bartender left on break leaving the other two tenders to service the 8 people surrounding them.  The two bartenders couldn't find the time to take our order, or ask if we needed new cocktails for our empty glasses.  I would be more compassionate if the dining room was packed or the bar was a zoo.    Over 10 minutes passed while we treaded water with empty glasses and hungry bellies.  Cant judge the food if we dont get a chance to order but the service was horrible! I didn't feel I had to beg for ordering food and drinks so we left $ on the bar for the cocktails we had.  Who knows if it was enough to cover the tab because we didn't even get a check.  I texted the same friend on the way home telling him of our poor experience and to my surprise he has since had the same experience I noted above.  Sorry to say,  El Segundo sol won't be getting a Segundo chance!!
