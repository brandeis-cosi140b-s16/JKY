Another seemingly dead spot for restaurant in Charlotte. But this time i think it is more than just bad fengshui.  When everyone else is hopping on a Saturday night, no reason this place should be as empty as it was... Unless the reason is subpar service and even worse food.  

The space is cute, I love the dimly lit by color string light atmosphere in the bar area.  We were greeted at the door by the DJ (didn't know they use the hostess stand as DJ booth until we were on the way out). We sat at the bar where it was virtually empty. Somehow it took the 2 bartenders a good while to acknowledge us. One was too busy closing out or something, which left the only other one to do the serving. She didn't have answers for any questions I had regarding drink special or food menu. 

I don't even recall what we had, since I wasn't the one needing to eat. I do remember the calamari being the chewiest batch I have ever had. EVER! And I eat lots of calamari. I am sure there is a very simple basic way of prepping them in order for them to not be chewy. When the best things I got was chips and salsa and I am sure they weren't even homemade, it may spell the end of a tex-mex restaurant.
