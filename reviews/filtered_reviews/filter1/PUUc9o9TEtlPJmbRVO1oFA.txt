I love Mexican and was on the lookout for a brand new spot to try and a friend suggested Border Grill at Mandalay Bay. 

Strolling in I had high expectations.  At first glance I really liked the decor and ambiance of this spot.   The hostess was pleasant and that is where the good service ended!  

It was a slow Monday night so you would think the service would be stellar since our waitress had three possibly 4 tables. She did quickly greeted us and took our drink order and then disappeared for what seemed like forever, realistically 15-20 minutes, but that is a long time when you are in need of an excellent margarita and some yummy Mexican food. 

Our waitress was then absent nearly all of our meal with someone else refilling our waters and delivering our food.   Our drinks were okay however weak, particularly for the price. They charge for tap water?? Really that is simply strange. I ordered the spicy shrimp tacos since I like spicy food and I was fairly dissatisfied with them. The portion was small and they forgot the spice! A label saying medium shrimp tacos would of been more appropriate. My friend ordered the Kobe beef tacos and was equally disillusioned with the portion and she said were unusually salty and dry.   

I expected better quality food and service for the price ($97 after tip for two entrees and some drinks).  There are too many nice Mexican locations in Vegas so I am putting Border Grill on my "Skip It" List.
