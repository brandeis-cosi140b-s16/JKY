The ONLY thing worth the calories was the Snickerdoodle cookie!
Ordered the machaca beef in a quesadilla (very salty and not very flavorful)
Jerk fried rice (it was cold and bland)
Chile Rellano (filled with Cheddar cheese--seriously! and coated in what looked like ritz crackers, no sauce topping)

My parents ordered the egg foo young and didn't receive the gravy on top, they had to ask for it and when they received it, it looked more like snot (it was clear and not very gravy like).
I was pretty disappointed to find out Guy Fieri from Diners Drive In's and Dives gave this place two thumbs up. I have also dined at Joe's Farm Grill that he also visited and will not suggest that place to anyone either. I'm starting to wonder about that show...
