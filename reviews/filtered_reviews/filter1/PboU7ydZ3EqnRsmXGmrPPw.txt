Boy did the food quality drop majorly since I was here last. Apparently the hotel and restaurant were sold and you can tell the new owners really couldn't care about quality and service anymore.

What used to be a hopping, full-of-fun and life restaurant is merely a shell of its former self. 

Food - if one could call it that - was awful. Stale, dry meat as part of the tacos and burritos. Rice and beans were like straight out of the can. All in all, it was pretty much disgusting.

Service? Well, our waitress did try. I think she was happy that we were drowning our hunger in booze.
