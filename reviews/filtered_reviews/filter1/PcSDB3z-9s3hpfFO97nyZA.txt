THE WORST MEXICAN FOOD!!! AND SERVICE!!!! 1st and last time there. Food was horrific . Rice had to much garlic or condiment and texture was nasty. It seems like they have the dishes ready , but sitting under a hot lamp. Every dish we ordered had no taste/or to much.  My son didn't even touch his burrito. What a waste!!! Horrible, Horrible. I get upset because being Mexican/American we can do much better. These people just got lucky they have a crowd !!! Really NC there are better REAL MEXICAN PLACES (AZTECA) is the place. Good luck!!!!
