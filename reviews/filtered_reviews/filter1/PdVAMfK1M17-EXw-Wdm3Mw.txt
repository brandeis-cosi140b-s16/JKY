A few weeks ago I took a friend out to lunch and decided to try Los Dos Molinos on Chandler Blvd......what a big mistake!  Ordered a burrito which was dry and not much flavor.  The salsa was way to hot.   My friend didn't like what she ordered either.  The food was way overpriced for what we got.  We both wished we had gone to Taco Bell instead!
