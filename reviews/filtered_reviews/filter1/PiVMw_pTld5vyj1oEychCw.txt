Let me start by saying that I usually love Z Tejas. I have been to other locations, and I've always enjoyed myself, had great service, and great food. 

First, the parking at this location is a nightmare. Especially during happy hour.  Very crowded, and we had to circle for 10 minutes to find a spot. 

Second, our friend looked up this location on the internet before we went to see if they had vegan food options, which it said it did. When we arrived, we discovered that they no longer offered vegan options. So she couldn't eat.

Third, we ordered a table full of appetizers to share. We sat at the table for 30 minutes before we stopped the waitress and asked her to bring cornbread.  Normally they bring that automatically - we were shocked that we had to ask for it. It took another 15 to 20 minutes (for a total of 45 to 50 minutes) to receive our food.  My husband's dish was lukewarm at best and had literally no flavor to it. He had ordered Green Chile Barbacoa enchiladas, and they were terrible.  The rest of the food was just okay. The guacamole that came in my Z Tejas trio had no flavor of any kind. 

Our waitress was a bit of a space cadet.  We asked for a glass of water and 10 minutes later had to remind her to bring it. She did take $15 off of our bill to make up for the slow service, but that simply wasn't enough. 

We will not be returning to this location.
