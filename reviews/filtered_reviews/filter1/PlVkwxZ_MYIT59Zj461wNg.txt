Never go here. Literally sitting here for two hours since I checked in and no food. The wait was over an hour when they told us 45 minutes. Been sitting at our table for well over an hour. How long does it take to get some tacos and a burrito. Ridiculous. I don't care if it is spring training. You are supposed to be "the best spot" so hire more people. This has no bearing on how the food is but the service is terrible.
