I ate here in June of 2007 with two family members. We liked the atmosphere and we were enjoying the meal. Our mistake came in the form of the guacamole, prepared tableside. The next day, we were all traveling back to our respective destinations. On the ride to the airport, I started feeling extremely ill. I was breaking out into a sweat and feeling nauseous. After I got home, I missed work the *next* day because I was still sick. Both family members that dined with me were also sick. The severity of our illness was directly related to the amount of the guacamole we had consumed.

So my advice to you? Please ask the guy preparing the guacamole if he washed his hands.
