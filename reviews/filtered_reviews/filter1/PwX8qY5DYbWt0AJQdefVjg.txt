Our group arrive at 5:45 pm Wednesday. It's now 6:24 and still no dinner. It took 15 min to get our water. So far, dissapointed. At this point, I don't care if the food is fantastic. Never coming here again. Our server was keysen.
We asked the server about our meal. He said "it should be out by now, let me check". ? ? ? Really..... if it's out, why is it not on our table?!
The other servers looked very attentive with their customers, while keysen would dissappear. 
6:35 and still nothing.
 We walked out.
