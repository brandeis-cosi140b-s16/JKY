I went with a group of coworkers after a long training nearby.  I've been here before but I don't remember my experience with it.  Your first impression of this place is that it's nice with it's decor.  I ordered water since I was with a boss.  The water tastes like fish swam in it. Yuck. I reordered a Coke.  $2.50!  When that came out, that tasted like stale, bitter and really flat Coke.  We told the lady and she later brought us another soda, which tasted better but still bitter.  (Clean your machine!!!)

I ordered a #2 lunch combo which was one cheese enchilada and two shredded beef taquitos served with rice and beans.  My coworker ordered a #1 but had them make her enchilada a chicken. She seemed to like hers much better than I did mine.  My enchilada tasted like they just wrapped two mozzarella sticks with a corn tortilla and the taquitos were absolutely tasteless.  The best part of the dish was the rice and beans. Yuck. 

I wish that we had gone somewhere else, but we figured since it was a couple doors down from the hotel it would be easier for all of us.  :/
