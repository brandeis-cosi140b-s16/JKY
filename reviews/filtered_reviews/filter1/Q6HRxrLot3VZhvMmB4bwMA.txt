Had been here many times before and this place HAD become one of my favorite places to eat while in LV. Not anymore. Arrived there and waited in line, ordered adobada tacos. Also ordered a couple lengua and tripas tacos. The taco guy was rushing and did not get my complete order. Once I let him know he lectured me for the next 2 minutes about giving him the complete order the first time (which I DID!) and ordering other types of tacos at the other lines. I agree with the other comments about the layout being horrible. So after being lectured, waited and waited and finally found a table to sit at and eat. AND then, found a long gray hair in my taco. Just great!!! GRRR. Needless to say, I was disgusted after that. Finished my other tacos. A MINUTE had gone by when one of the employees that cleans tables asked if we were done eating because there was other people waiting for a table. NOT A MINUTE had passed since I finished chewing for God's sake!!!!! Who does that???!!! Believe me, I knew people were waiting for a table and no I did plan on sitting there for hours! Just simply bad experience!
