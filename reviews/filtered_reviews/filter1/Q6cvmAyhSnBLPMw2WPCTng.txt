Bring a pair of ear plugs or two.  I was deaf for like 10 minutes after coming out of this place.  Still don't know what all the hypes are about this place seeing there are always a line waiting to get it every Fridays and Saturdays.  The interior space is very small and you can't really dance with anyone in your group.  I'll be staying away from this place for a while before returning there again.
