how do you mess up Guacamole?    Apparently Steel Cactus can by making it with Avocado's that don't seem particularly ripe, mixing in some of the weird green fake avocado paste, and refrigerating it (it came out in it's bowl with water on the bottom).  Wack.

Also, we were told that shrimp taco's were good after being told the interesting sounding beet tacos weren't.   Shrimp taco's sucked - kinda sweet and not particularly noteworthy.  

The upstairs open air terrace is kinda cool, but this place sucks.
