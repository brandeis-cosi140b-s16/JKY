Never go here for a family celebration. My family made reservations here for my graduation dinner, but they gave our table away and set us up in the bar instead. At one point they acted like we didn't have a reservation even though we dropped off a cake that morning. This was fine once fixed, but once happy hour started we were pushed out. Literally pushed out and the waiters threw my gifts onto the floor while they were trying to clear the table and get us out. The waitress messed up all of our orders and when we asked for patron margaritas she insisted on giving us house margaritas, which were nasty. The reason she wanted to give us house margaritas was because they were pre made. Horrible graduation dinner.
