Unfortunately the reviews here were spot on!  We were shopping nearby last night, figured have never been so we would try it....HUGH MISTAKE!  It was packed with a 20 min wait so figured maybe it is good...wrong!  The food is really terrible, stingy with the chips and salsa, lackluster service and attention to detail, dirty, and not a good value.
