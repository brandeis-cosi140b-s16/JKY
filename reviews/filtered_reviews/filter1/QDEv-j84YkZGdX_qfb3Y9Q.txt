ROACH, ROACH, ROACH.  We dined at Frank and Lupe's on December 1st 2012 and one of the people in our group found a dead roach in their Coke.  He did not notice it until he had 3 refills.  At that point we all wanted to throw up but we could not leave because they demanded we pay for our food.  They manager had to call the owner and he did not seem to care.  The staff was rude the entire time and never said they were sorry for what happened.  They would rather make $40 dollars off of us then take care of the customer.  We were not the first to have this happen there are other review below that had ROACHES in drinks.  Do not eat here it needs to go out of business.  I am calling the department of health today to report this place.  They could have fixed it with service but instead wanted to argue with us and not simply say they were sorry.
