Today I had some of the  the worst food I have ever eaten, anywhere.  The tamale was tasteless mush and unevenly heated.  The rice was lukewarm warm and nothing special.  There were chips that tasted out of the bag, or old.  To top things off, they are overpriced especially compared to other Mexican restaurants.  The waitress was nice but that was the only semi-positive.  I will never go here a
gain!
