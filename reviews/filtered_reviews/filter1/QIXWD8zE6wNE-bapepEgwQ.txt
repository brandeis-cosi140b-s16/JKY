Ordered a vegan meal. Halfway through,found four pieces of chicken in my tacos. I understand shit happens. We are human. What really grinded my gears was after I told the waitress my situation, she came back and said the chef said it's sweet potato.  Sweet potato does have flesh,  or smell like chicken. That was what passed me off. All she had to do was say yes, there was a mistake and somehow chicken got in it. I would have been on with that. The fact she came out and lied to me saying it was sweet potato was enough for me to walk out. So basically nacho daddy doesn't really give a shit about their vegan customers. So watch out for the " sweet potatoes. "
