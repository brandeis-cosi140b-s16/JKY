One word to describe this place.. HORRIBLE!  I do not write reviews unless I have experienced the place at least twice.  The first time was a year ago, based off reviews that gave this place four and half stars.  My first experience, horrible food and horrible service (a server passing by the back of the chair my Dad was sitting in  pushed it in with his hip in order to squeeze between my Dad's chair and another's chair, instead of saying "excuse me" or "I apologize"  he just ignored my Dad's negative reaction).  Not to mention it seemed they had not dusted the place since the built the building.  Nasty!  My second experience came as part of a dinner with friends who invited me.  Again, food horrible and service has not improved.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND this place at all.
