Ok I must first say that we went here because my son in law raved about it.  I wish i would of checked yelp first. (note to self, check yelp first!)

We had a group of 10, they sat us and brought out the drinks and appetizer quickly.  But that's the only positive thing I can say.  The waiter was odd or something!?!  He jumped around the table and took all the guys orders first then went back around and got the girls.  They took their time with the order which would of been fine if they had made everything correctly but two of the plates were made wrong, so my daughter decided to share with my son in law instead of waiting of a remake and the other just eat it as it was made.  The waiter gave my plate to someone else in the party and by time i received a plate and the mistake was noticed half my rice and beans were gone, and the waiter was like well they said it was their plate!!  

besides everything, the food was way below average.  And the two that shared a plate were both up with their heads in the toilet most of the night.  And since we had a large group the useless waiter got a $43.00 tip automatically included in the bill.

There are so many choices on the strip.  Stay clear of this place unless u just go for the happy hour drinks.  But in Vegas everybody's got happy hour...so just stay clear.
