This place is terrible. I don't even want to talk about how loud it is and how bad the food was. The walls are shiny and change with the television, which is disorienting, there are children running and crying, the floor is wet and dirty. 
The server stopped by....but only to bring us carryout materials and basically asking us to leave. Yikes.

I guess I could get drunk here though, it's pretty cheap.
