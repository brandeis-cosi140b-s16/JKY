This place was pretty disgusting, dirty, over priced, bad service, bad food yuck.  Got the two taco plate one ground beef and one chicken with beans and rice.  I dont know how they screwed up that ground beef to taste like it wasnt beef.  At least the chicken tasted like chicken but bland and nothing special.  Beans tasteless and of course rice same thing.  Looks like a family run business and nobody cares.  They are hiding in the back most of the time.  Friend walked up to get someones attention but crickets so I actually whistled really loud so my friend could get a beer to wash away the bad taste.  Will definitely never return.
