I assume this place is owned by the same people who own the 16th street location but if it is, OMG what are you doing polluting your brand?  Stopped there the other night before a flight and was excited because I like the orginal.  No ambience and I had this waitress who looked and acted miserable.  She also made me feel rushed.  So, she pushes the special tequila margarita and i get one.  Just okay.  Then I ask if you can mix and match tacos.. don't want four of the same taco.  No.  Then I order a  chile plate and it was so cold and gross it was inedible.  I sent it back and asked for guamamole and chips which was actually quite good.  Although when the waitress was preparing it tableside she seemed bored and irritated.   To her credit she didn't charge me for the chile.  Real disappointment... go next door to the Grande Orange cafe.
