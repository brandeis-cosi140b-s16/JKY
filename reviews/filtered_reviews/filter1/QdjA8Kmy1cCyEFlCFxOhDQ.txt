I will never step foot in this establishment again. This is my 3rd time here and the service has yet to improve. Waiter/Waitresses are continuously very cold not personable. Moving on the food was below average ( chicken fajita  - blackened tuna salad) tuna was over cooked and the fajita  was thrown together! The waiter could obviously notice the tuna was not prepared as we requested however failed to ever ask if we enjoyed our dish. We feared speaking up about the matter due to the poor service and chances of food contamination.
