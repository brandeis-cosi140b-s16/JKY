So disappointed since it's in my neighborhood. Interesting format but sloppy and disorganized assembly line. All the meats were super spicy, which paired with salsa, was way too hot. The tortilla soup remnants we had had NO TORTILLA, if there's no tortilla, its not tortilla soup! /end. The cookies were the highlight of the meal.

Now, they also have HORRENDOUS customer service! First off, no ice. I am so irritated that I will not come back again and will tell anyone who will listen how rude the blond cashier was. My sister had accidentally spilled our soup all over her hands and on the floor. No big deal, but not a single napkin in sight. When we asked for some, she returned with a wad of brown paper towels and then completely ignored us. Not a single staff member offered to replace our spilled soups or came to clean it up, just kept moving along as if they expected us to clean up the soup ourselves. I hate to think that it was a race thing, but their behavior was completely suspect. The manager came up to her to ask what happened, nodded, then returned to the assembly line. When I asked for a drink, she said there's no ice. But when she rung up this lovely young white couple, she said that they were making more and would bring it to them. WTF, I guess they don't want us black folks eating there.

P.S. This place doesn't hold a candle next to Barrio Cafe or Richardson's, what a joke.
