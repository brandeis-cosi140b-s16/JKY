Wow! Really, you would have thought the a new restaurant management team would have instructed their team TO BE ALL OVER EACH AND EVERY GUEST THAT WALKS IN THAT DOOR.
Walked in without a reservation at 3:00 in the afternoon Sunday Cinco de mayo .
I was promptly greeted by two lovely hostess who ask how many in your party, I replied one please.
They then informed me that if I sat at the bar I could order food there too. I can only assume they didn't want me to take up valuable seating in their 75% empty restaurant. Single patrons beware you don't warrant a seat in the dining room unless you bring a friend.
So whatever sitting at the bar is not the worst thing in the world, I just wanted to eat. 
So I'm greeted by a lovely bartender who asks if I would like a drink and I told her no I'd like to see a menu. She drops the menus and walked away without a word.
That's the last time I spoke to her. It was at this point her partner asks me if I would like some water at which I replied yes. She got me water and that was the last time I spoke to her.
Now the first bartender who gave me the menu is greeting her friends and is very happy to see them and sits them right next to me. She promptly gets them chips and salsa and tells them all about the wonderful things to eat on the brunch menu. Now I'm really hungry can't wait till her or her partner takes my order. 
Now she's standing and talking to her friends while I'm still hoping to place an order. 
So I give it a few minutes, what the heck her partner will notice I've been over looked and she will probably take my order. Nope looks at me at least three times never utters a word, time for me to leave.
Everyone should know this is probably going to be a great restaurant in the future, when they get the kinks worked out and re-address customer service. 
I'll give them a second chance.
One star for the H2O!
