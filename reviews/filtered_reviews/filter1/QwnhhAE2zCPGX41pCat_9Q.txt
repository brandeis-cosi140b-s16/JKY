We were looking for a Chipotle but figured Cafe Rio would be basically the same thing. What a mistake. I've never regretted eating a meal more. Not only was the food completely bland, the service was awful. The kid who took our order was radiating hatred at every customer and seemed to be annoyed that we were there despite how easy our order was and then the girl who rang us up never made eye contact once. It made for a pretty uncomfortable environment and then the food was just a giant let down. I'll definitely head straight for Chipotle next time, or better yet, Lindo Michochaun.
