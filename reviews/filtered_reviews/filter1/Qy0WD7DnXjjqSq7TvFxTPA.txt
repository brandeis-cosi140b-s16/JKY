BLASPHEMY!!!

I've been eating at Tacos el Gordo in Chula Vista for over 10 years and I'm ashamed this place is here.

People eating here must be DRUNK or something.

You guys don't even get a star. You guys get a FART from me. You get a star because yelp made me do it. I give it to........ THE HORCHATA.

I understand this is Vegas, on the strip, so it was packed. Understandable. I love this place so much I chose to wait the 35 min for my tacos... TWICE!!

One of the things that baffled me was how the ADOBADA HANDLER was slicing the meat, and instead of this delicious meat going on the taco as he's slicing it, HE LET IT FALL ONTO THIS TRAY WITH THE REST OF THE MEAT THAT HAD BEEN SITTING THERE FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG. And this meat kept cooking on this tray. -____-

WHYYY??? please tell me why you would do that??? 

The right way? from the rotisserie into the taco

ROTISSERIE INTO THE TACO !!! not rotisserie to heat griddle... all the juices...GONE!!! 

The cheese on my MULA was burnt -_______-

Is it because they're busy??? No that makes no sense!! People are already waiting anyways !!

The other thing that almost made me cry was the ONIONS... They mass cook the onions so when you ask for them they are already soggy and taste more of oil than anything else :_( 

Chula Vista location cooks the onions to order so they're fresh, delicious, and tasty.

I wondered once again if this was because they were extra busy but... NO because people wait either way!! So why not serve quality over you guys being lazy and mass cooking onions in quantity??

The only thing I had from here was ADOBADA... which made me sick and I had such a bad stomach ache last night I cried.

This place is not Tacos el Gordo I'm sorry.
