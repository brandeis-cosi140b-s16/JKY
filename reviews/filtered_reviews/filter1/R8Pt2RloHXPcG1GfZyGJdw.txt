I was visiting from out of town.  Was told that I HAD to try the Mexican food in Arizona.  I should have read the reviews before I decided on this place.  We were seated right away.  It was lunch time and I think we were one of 3 occupied tables there at the time and sat in the outdoor area.  We were "greeted" by Molly, our server.  What a piss-poor attitude on her.  No smile, nothing.  We were lucky to get a response out of her when we asked a question.  She took our order and left.  Maybe saw her once more during our meal?
I"m guessing that you don't get complimentary chips and salsa at Mexican restaurants in Arizona?  At least that is what I experienced in the 2 that I visited while vacationing there.  I would have expected it with the prices we paid for the lunch we had there.  I ordered the enchiladas.  They were so-so.  Hard on the ends that I couldn't even cut through them with my fork and using the knife was even difficult.  Needless to say, I didn't eat much of the 2 I was served.   We didn't see much of Molly and in fact, had to go looking for her to get our check. 
If this is what Arizona has to offer in Mexican food, you can have it.  I won't be back there or recommending this place to anyone.
