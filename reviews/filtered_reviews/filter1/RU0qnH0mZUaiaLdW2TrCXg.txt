I went to this location one other time and have went to the Ahwatukee and Mesa location. Which I love. Well last night I went here. I waited a hour for a table. Which I am fine with. But the service was terrible. The people next to us stopped the mgr and asked could he take their order. He did but when we asked the same thing he said he would be right back. No one came for 30 minutes. So now we were there for almost 2 hours with nothing ordered. Once we did order they served me the Shrimp Veracruz with store bough tortillas. I asked what happened to the homemade. I was then brought homemade but told for my particular meal THE OWNER said to serve store bought. Really? My dish is the most expensive item on the menu. So why skimp. The food was good but the service was terrible. Also my friend never got his taco. Our server acted as if we were an inconvenience. No worries because I will NEVER GO BACK there.
