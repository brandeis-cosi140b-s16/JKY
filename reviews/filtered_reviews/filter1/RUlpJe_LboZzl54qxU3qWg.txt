If I could give this restaurant negative stars I would. My boyfriend and I were on a double date and we decided to stop by for happy hour. We were greeted when we first walked in and requested to sit outside but we were told that they were not serving outside? It was such a beautiful day I wouldn't see why. So we requested for a booth seeing that there was hardly anyone in the restaurant (after experiencing the horrible service I understood why). The hostess sat us at the booth all the way in the back by the kitchen when she could have sat us in the front. 

Our waitress came by and didn't even introduce herself or even smiled. She gave us our menus and went to go get our water. When we ordered a couple of beers she asked for our ID's and couldn't even do simple math in her head to figure out our age. Then when she finally figured out we were old enough she thought our ID's were fake! LOL! She didn't even know anything about what kind of beers they had... Come on, you have to know what you're selling. That's like going to a car dealership and the salesman knowing nothing about cars! When I ordered my fish tacos and asked for lettuce instead of cabbage she said "No. I don't think we even have lettuce in the kitchen. Our menu is different from other restaurants you can't substitute anything." Uhhhhh they have Caesar Salad on their menu so what do they make that with? 

I wouldn't go back to this restaurant even if I was paid to. A restaurant is only as good as their workers. Listen to all the other reviews and go someplace where the workers actually know what they are serving!
