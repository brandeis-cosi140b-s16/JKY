Maybe it was just Cinco de Mayo, but I got here just before the lunch rush really got going to order a simple carne asada burrito (regular size) and I waited 45!! minutes for my bag. The kitchen reported they were really backed about 20 minutes into, because they had so many online orders. I had to complain to the owner himself to finally get my food (strange that it magically appeared once he asked what was going on...)
**Note to Mr. Bortin** Get rid of the online orders until you figure out your kitchen paces during the lunch rush. It's not fair to people who actually get off there butts to go and place an order at the restaurant by attending to the online orders. 
There were at least 15 disgruntled customers complaining about the back up.
The carne asada burrito - you can get better in LA for about $3.50. It's grand larceny to charge $5.75 for that appetizer size morcel. In fact all your plates sized are poor in value. The ceviche probably is the biggest joke of all.
At least they are smiling their way to the bank. Congratulations to the owners on duping the gueros out there who think because the owner's wife is from Mexico and the that the place isn't in a 'shady' part of town they are getting an equally comfortable and authentic Mexican taco shop experience. I guess that means paying "guero" prices too. How many Mexicans do you see queuing up for food in this place? Ninguno!  Think about it people, the value proposition is very low for a taco stand. Don't get caught up in the hype.
