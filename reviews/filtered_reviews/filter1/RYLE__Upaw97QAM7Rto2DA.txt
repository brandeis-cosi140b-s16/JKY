Are you kidding me? This place is absolutely awful. We were there today before the giants exhibition game. All 6 of us thought our entrees were terrible. Sensing we were less than pleased the young waiter told us we should have asked him for his opinion before we ordered. Dude, if you have the key to the secret menu share it!  

One guy in our party ordered the Caesar with chicken with the dressing on the side. It came out wrong and when by the time it was replaced the rest of us were long done with our entrees. Oh yeah. He threw a tip on the bill ( I assume because we were a party of 6). What a tool.
