Went there with friends. Had the pollo fundido. It was good. Problem was there was a table of 20 somethings near us. They were very drunk, and the waiter continued to serve them. They were obnoxious, yelling f bombs constantly. My friend's wife eventually became irritated with constant barrage of expletives. At this point, I asked them to kindly cut back on the f-bombs. You would have thought I insulted their mothers by their response. immediately, the 4 guys became belligerent and threatened to kick our asses. One guy even asked the waiter if he could beat me up. He said that he knew the owner and he could do whatever he wanted. At this point, we decided to leave with our meals unfinished. I didn't take my family out to fight with 4 drunks. I spoke to the manager. He did apologize, and admitted that they WERE REGULARS. Apparently, he did speak to them, as they were leaving while we paid our bill at the front register. The manager didn't offer to comp us anything for our troubles. At least it wasn't boring. If you like to fight with drunks, maybe they will be when you go!
