I am so disappointed with my dining experience tonight. I LOVE Mexican food and margaritas so when visiting my home town I had to try this cute new place in Garfield. Well cute is about all it is...from the terrible chipotle salsa to the hard, cold rice and beans to the lack luster waiter. I mean ugh! Don't even get me started on the awful margarita....I am sad, so very sad with this meal. My last meal in Pittsburgh. I think I would have been better off at Taco Bell. At least I would have only wasted $10. 

Best thing about this place? Leaving it...
