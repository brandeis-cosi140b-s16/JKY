STAY AWAY!!!  my kids took me there for my 45 birthday and they sat us in a booth with so many flies the manager had to come over with BUG SPRAY and spray the window.!! The pesticide was so strong they had to move us to other booth she had just sprayed. There were dead flies everywhere. Needless to say when our food came we had to fight the flies for it. The dessert was horrible, the drinks were garbage and they wouldn't offer to take it back. Not a good bday!!!!
