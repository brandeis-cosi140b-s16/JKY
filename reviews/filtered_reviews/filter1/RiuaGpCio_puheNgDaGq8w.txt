Horrible service. They're lucky to get 1 star. Because of the incompetent people that work here, the quality of the food is highly affected. Ordered 3 salads, the amount of meat is inconsistent, beans are watery because it's almost gone & they didn't refill it, lettuce from bucket was also watery when they refill it, didn't bother to shake extra water. So the salads were like soup. Asian guy employee was so irritated that he could just careless. The owner of this place should think of revamping his/her staff. Felipe
