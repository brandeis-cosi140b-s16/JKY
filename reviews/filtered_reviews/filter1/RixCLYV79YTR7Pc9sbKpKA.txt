Our hotel recommended this as a good patio, happy sp.ot.  I would say different. our waitress started off helpful and nice. She brought our drinks out fast along with chips and salsa. That is where it stopped. we never ever saw her again. Ever. We asked management, still no one. We had a qu estion about the salsa, why fizzy? No ideaswe left what we thought our drinks cost and headed over .cien agaves and I would give 5 stars. I do worry that our waitress fell of the planet? Hope she landed somewhere safe.
