I can describe the service in one short word " horrible" our waiter was beyond rude. Honestly I am not even sure how in the world he is working there. 

The sad part is the manager saw the whole thing and didn't do anything about it. 
Food, I can't believe I had to pay for something that we didn't even eat. it was very bad. 

We were so sorry to waste a meal there where there are so many amazing restaurants in Las Vegas. 

BIG MISTAKE - Stay AWAY!
