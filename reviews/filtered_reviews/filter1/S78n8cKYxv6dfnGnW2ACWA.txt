When is this stupid "Fresh Mex" craze going to end?  How many more dime-a-dozen Americanized (read: bland) Mexican places do we really need?  Over a decade ago it was Baja Fresh... That was cool, nice fresh change from Filiberto's, and all the other wonderful greasy Mexican places.  Then a few years ago we got Chipotle.  And it was fun for awhile, but eventually you get sick of eating the same rice-saturated burrito over and over and over again.  Now we also have Qdoba, Costa Vida, Cafe Rio, and a few other places.

I wish I could avoid eating at all these places for the rest of my life, but alas, sometimes I find myself there, choking down this tedious slop, because all my friends like this kind of food, and I like to be sociable (on rare occasions).  Or, as in the situation that brought me to Cafe Rio, it's where the family is having dinner.

Anyways, I had their "special" pork barbecoa (or whatever they call it), and it was pedestrian, at best.  It did not taste natural; sorry, guys, but pork is not supposed to be sweet.  It's supposed to be nice and smoky.  It's supposed to taste like meat.

This place is the epitome of the worst aspects of disposable American culture.  No heart, no soul, and large portions.  It doesn't matter what it tastes like, as long as it fills your stomach, right?  Cafe Rio is possibly the worst offender; I think I would rather eat at Qdoba or Costa Vida.
