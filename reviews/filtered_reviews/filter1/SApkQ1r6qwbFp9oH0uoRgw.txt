Honestly it was location that made it convenient for me to eat here.  I had the Adobo chilaquiles and honestly the chips and salsa was better than the entree that wasn't worth the cost.  But of course it's Vegas and nothing's cheap but of course you'd hope to have quality food to match the price.  It's not that great at all, perhaps the alcohol can fade out the quality of food when drunk but if on a sober note you come here, have a beer, chips and salsa if you have to.
