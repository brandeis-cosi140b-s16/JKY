If you're a vegetarian do not go here...there is not one vegetarian item on the menu. The guacamole tostada sounds like a safe bet right? NOPE! There's lard in the tostada. Lard in the tortilla chips too...ugh. 

Not only does the menu suck, the service is 50 times worse. The restaurant literally has 13 tables in what feels like a 10x10 jail cell. My boyfriend and I waited for the check for literally over 20 minutes....just sitting....and waiting. It took us less time to drive there, order, get our food, and eat than it did to get the check. 

Don't expect your drink to be refilled either...unless you're drinking water.  

The food....not even that good.
