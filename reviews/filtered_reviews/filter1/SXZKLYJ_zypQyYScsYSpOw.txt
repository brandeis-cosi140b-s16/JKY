I have been going to Cafe Rio for years,but this was my first time on this location-and probably the last one. I always have the Tostada and the portion is huge and satisfying. This time the size was the half of what I'm used to. I brought it to their attention, and the answer I got was "we do it this way here". Well...if you are operating a franchise, every aspect of the business should be the same at every location. I am very disappointed! I left hungry, and my friend,who came with me for the first time,will never return. Shame on You!
