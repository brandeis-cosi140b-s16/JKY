Good chips and salsa are rendered meaningless with the inconsistent and mostly horrible food.  Do not order anything with fish in it since it comes out microwaved and massively overcooked.  The margarita's are tiny, overly sweet with the lack of tequila they put in them, and expensive.  The taco's, and bean burritos are good but their fish tacos are soggy, small, expensive and tasteless.  A really bad place to eat, but the atmosphere is cool with the indoor fish pond.  Keep your expectations low if you go there.
