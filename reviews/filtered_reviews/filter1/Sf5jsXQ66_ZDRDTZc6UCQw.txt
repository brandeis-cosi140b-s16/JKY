This was the saltiest food I have ever eaten!!! I wasn't very impressed with the way the place is set up to start with. I felt like I was in line at an amusement park. The different stations are confusing. We thought we would try something simple- tacos. I took one bite and threw my carne asada taco in the trash because it had no flavor or seasoning other than salt. My partner ordered 2 tacos, one carne asada and one al pastor and it was the same thing with the al pastor, no flavor other than salt. She tried to eat them because she was starving but ended up throwing away over half her food. The restaurant was also not clean, the table was sticky and the salsa bar was a mess. I would definitely not recommend eating here unless you have no tastebuds. I will never go back!!
