Sorry I decided to stop in. Friday happy hour, bad experience.  Cheese  crisp was greasy, wings were old, chewy, and drowning in sauce. My wife had a mango margarita that was too sweet. She tried a different variety that tasted like soap. Waiter (Diego) comped it , thankfully.  When she got home she puked it up. If you want good Mexican, drive on by this dump. Just because the view is good doesn't mean the food is good. I'll never go back.
