What a joke of a restaurant. After waiting for 45 minutes for my food I was given a plate of cold rice and shrimp tacos. I ate 1/2 of a taco and couldn't eat anymore but was still charged for 1 taco. That place is an embarrassment. And the management made excuses for their awful food. I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone. Also blonde manager specifically told me Javier the owner charges for anything that is consumed even if it is cold. REALLY Javier??? for being such a fine establishment in the Aria casino I expected much much more.
