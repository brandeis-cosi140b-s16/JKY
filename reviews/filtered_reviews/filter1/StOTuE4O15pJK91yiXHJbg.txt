Been through here a few times, now, over the span of months or longer - and the only thing that sticks out is that the hostess is consistently a bit of a wench... Making this place worth avoiding. They get one star, only because you can't give them zero.

Don't waste your money, here... If you want Mexican food, just walk around the corner to Hussong's, instead - it's better food, better margaritas, and a bit cheaper, overall.
