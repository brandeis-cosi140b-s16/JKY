Horrible. Gross food. Worse service. Disgusting drinks. This was my second time here. The first time we came, we got dinner. It was awful. This time, I got sucked in by a buy one get one coupon. How bad could just drinks possibly be, I thought? This was by far the worst margarita I have ever had. And I'm Mexican. The bartender acted like he was doing me a favor, dispensing the putrid concoction from the decrepit Taylor machine... Never again.
