My husband and I were regular's here.  The last couple of times were terrible.  The first time it was bad we chalked it up to a fluke.  After the 2nd we won't be returning.

Everything was cold.  The queso needed a spoon, cold.  I ordered the tortilla soup, COLD.  I will admit that the waitress was awesome.  She understood I was unhappy and made every attempt to fix it.  Even explained that they had a new chef.  

Nope. No more!
