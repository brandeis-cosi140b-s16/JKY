Worst burritos I've ever had, not only was the service slow but the burrito had small ingredients mixed in that weren't even supposed to be there. I got a California burrito, asked for guacamole, which they did not include and tucked into the fold of the awful tortilla was fried egg...what the hell are these people doing?

The whole thing was a runny mess of beans and almost no other ingredients. The cashier was extremely rude, the meat was sub-par and I'm pretty sure the chips were radioactive. 

All in all, I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and if you're saying this is the best Mexican place you clearly haven't been anywhere other than Del Taco or some other crap fast food chain.
