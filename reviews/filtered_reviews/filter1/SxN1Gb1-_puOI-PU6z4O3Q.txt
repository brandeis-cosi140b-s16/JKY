The service was great, but the food was not. We ordered chicken tacos and had to return then because they were cold and the green Chile sauce was frozen! If I am going to eat a $12 taco, then the tortillas should AT LEAST be had made. I don't care about the atmosphere or fancy lighting, if you consider yourself a Mexican gourmet restaurant, at least offer better food than taco bell. Ose prices need to come down or they will be out of business. You can pay the same amount of money and get better food at Lucille's.
