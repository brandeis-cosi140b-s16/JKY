Let's just say the food was great. Absolutely great. The service however was horrible. Worst I have ever had. I was with a group of 4. Ordered iced tea, got iced coffee. Food came out fast, but didn't not see our server for the remainder of the meal. Had to walk up to the manager and ask for check. Table next to us got up and walked out after not being greeted for 30 minutes. Sad that horrible service trumps great food. I know this better than anyone as a chef.
