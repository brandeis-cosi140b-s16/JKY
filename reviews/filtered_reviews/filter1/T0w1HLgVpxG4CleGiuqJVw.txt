Service was okay. They were good until after we ordered then pretty much forgot about us. I ordered a large menudo and two Carne Asada Tacos. With my first sip of the soup I was smacked in the mouth with salt. I tried adding lots of lime but couldn't cut through the saltiness. I tried some of the meat and had to spit it out. I swear it was old. I moved on to the tacos. They were okay,  though the meat was very bland and the tortillas were stiff. Never coming here again
