I really really wanted to love this place. It looked great from the outside and walking in, the decor was well done. It is clean and inviting. However, although we were the only two customers in the entire store during lunch hour, the service was still very slow. The food was overpriced and not very good.  At the end of our lunch we waited quite a while and no one brought the check. Finally my friend just got up to find an employee. I will say that I don't gamble or drink so I can't rate those items.
