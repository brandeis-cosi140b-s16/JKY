DO NOT EAT HERE! Go in, get your 2-for-1 drinks, then leave. All the terrible reviews on here are spot on... Wish I would have listened to my gut!

I wasn't very hungry so I opted for tortilla soup and a side of fries. HOW CAN YOU SCREW THAT UP?! Also, my friend got a chicken taco salad... Again- how how you mess that up?? The "tortilla" soup was basically some weird tomato soup concoction that they give you tortilla strips and cheese to put it it- absolutely disgusting. And the fries came out cold and soggy. It took 10 minutes to get new fries out. 

Also, my friends chicken salad looks amazing when it came out... Well looks can be deceiving. There was zero taste, seriously, the sour cream was the only thing that made it edible.

Many reviews state that its about the atmosphere... Yea, absolutely... We had a good time (other than the fact that we got the ONLY server that had zero personality). But the prices DO NOT match the food quality. A Caesar salad for $17- give me a break!!

As I already stated- do NOT eat at this restaurant!
