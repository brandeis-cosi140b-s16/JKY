Was one of the worst dining experiences. 
Party of 3 sat down ordered drinks first, than appetizers, the table side gucomole came and was made, the other app's came, drinks still sitting at the end of bar. Had to ask for them after waiting 20 mins. Asked 3 times for coke. Ordered a Cadillac margarita cost was $5.00 more on top of the already $12.00 .
The worst drink ever! Over priced for not  being on strip... Asked for more tortillas,  was charged extra for those as well..Will never be back... 3 appetizers, 3 drinks $100 without tip...BOO!
Far better places in Vegas than Eldorado. ..
