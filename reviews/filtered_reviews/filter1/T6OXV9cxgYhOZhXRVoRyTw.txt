I was at Salty's Peoria this afternoon after the spring training game and I was very unhappy with the service!  First of all, it took us almost an hour before a server came to our table.  We had to get our own menus while we were waiting for service and once a server came to our table and took our drink orders (she would not take our food order at the same time), it took another 15-20 minutes for our drinks; when we ordered the drinks we asked for chips and salsa--we were told that it would be at least 10 minutes because they were making the salsa--really?  This is not your first rodeo when it comes to serving the public after spring training games--as a matter of fact, you encourage people to come to your establishment after games--you should have had plenty of salsa ready to go.  (It took over 30 minutes before we got the chips & salsa.)  When we finally got our drinks, she took our food orders--that took another 20 minutes.  Then when the food arrived, it was wrong.  I decided to order the 2 taco special, but the server never came back to give her the order, so I only ate chips & salsa.  When we finally found our server, I ordered a beer--she forgot to bring it to me until I flagged her down and asked for the beer AGAIN.  I have been to this place many times, and sometimes the service is slow, but it has NEVER been this bad before.  Needless to say, she did not get a good tip at all.  But it was not all her fault--we flagged down a man several times asking for someone to serve us and he kept assuring us someone would be over--and we waited and waited--no one.  We should not have to hunt servers down.  Not impressed and not sure if we will return...very disappointed!

P.S.  The bathrooms were dirty and they had someone asking for "tips" for handing us paper towels, really?
