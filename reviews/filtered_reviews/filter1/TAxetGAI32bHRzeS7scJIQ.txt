My Emiliano's experience was, in one word: horrific. Upon bringing the salsa and chips to our table, the waiter proceeded to dump the dish of salsa all over me, and my down jacket (it got on my suede shoes, jeans and other members of my party as well). The server was very apologetic, and I like to think that my party was understanding. After all, accidents happen to all of us. 

The waiter helped to mop the floor, and wipe down my jacket (albeit with a questionably sanitary dish rag) and apologized profusely. We asked to see the manager and explained the scenario to him. I asked that they comp the dry cleaning on my jacket, and he begrudgingly agreed. 

Our food came promptly, and was delivered by the manager. Upon handing my sister her plate, he said (under his breath): "Don't touch the plate, it's hot. I wouldn't want to have to pay for your hospital bill too."  We found this a little off-putting, but tucked into our meals anyway. 

The food was mediocre at best, and both me and my sister found the retried beans to be inedible. They tasted as if they had been burnt, or had liquid smoke added to them. The flavor was overpowering, and even a healthy dose of Cholula couldn't help. As we were leaving, another waiter made a snide comment about my request to comp my dry cleaning. 

Overall, our experience at Emiliano's was disappointing. The food was just mediocre, and wasn't nearly enough to make up for the treatment of the managers and waitstaff. (For clarity's sake: our personal waiter was very apologetic and understanding of the situation). I will never return.
