What a difference two years can make. Another reviewer nailed it when they said that as the company has grown, quality has suffered - and the worst part is, Cafe Rio corporate just doesn't care. This used to be one of my favorite fast-casual dining options in Phoenix, but now, it's just terrible. The food quality is inconsistent, the employees don't know how to tightly roll a burrito or assemble a salad, and the service is chock full of attitude I don't remember ordering. I've written an angry letter to the corporate office but I don't expect to hear back from them, like ever. So sad.
