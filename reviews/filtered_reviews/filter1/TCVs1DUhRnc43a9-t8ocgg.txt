Liars! They sold a "get it now"group on so my husband bought it specifically for Labor Day on it-it stated it was only valid for September 2nd for lunch. We purchase two beers, six wings, a burrito, and beef tacos. The total came to $80. They would not accept the group on. They said they were trying to block out that group on for two weeks, but it just had been post one week earlier. So we had to pay all that money for two lousy beers and some pretty generic food. Save your money, their are a lot better places on the strip, with much better food, that is reasonably priced.
