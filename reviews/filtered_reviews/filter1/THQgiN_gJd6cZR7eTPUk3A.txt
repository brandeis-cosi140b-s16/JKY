There is nothing good about this place. Well, perhaps the chips. And Salsa. Those might be alright, but they certainly aren't enough to make me go back. Ever.
I ordered a cheese enchilada. CHEESE darn it! TWENTY minutes later I cut into my food to find chicken.
Vegetarian here. I asked for cheese, thank you. 
I was so mad I asked for a box and left. I gave the food to my dad. I didn't want to wait another twenty minutes for the correct order to come out. No amount of chips and salsa could satisfy me.
Service, obviously, is not great. They will give you the chips and salsa, which is pretty hot, and one drink. Then they will make you wait, and eat your hot salsa. Then, with a hot mouth, you will drink all of your drink. And they make you wait, and wait, and wait, for a refill. In the span of almost an hour, I got one refill. One.
