Joyride is a bad restaurant to go to because the music is far too loud. Also their margaritas are of very low quality, using only the cheapest possible ingredients. I don't know why they need a bartender because they serve what could be a store bought margarita mix. The cost of two margaritas and a diet pepsi was $22. Also, Joyride as no blender, so all they make is margaritas on the rocks. Why they would not have a blender is totally illogical. The waiter actually said, "it we would be great if we had a blender." Joyride is the type of restaurant that you have a hard time believing is still in business. 

We were not able to stay to actually eat anything becuase the restaurant itself was so unpleasant to stay in. But the restaurant is clearly focused on style over substance.
