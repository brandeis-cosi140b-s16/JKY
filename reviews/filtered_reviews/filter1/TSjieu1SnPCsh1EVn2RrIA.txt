YOU'LL BE SORRY IF YOU DINE HERE.

I ended up at this beer joint because I was herded into it by a group of friends, who were starving and just wanted to sit down and eat.

THE FOOD: Is commercial at best and expensive. A better dinning experience can be had by buying a Swanson Mexican TV dinner and taking it to your room. To make things worse, the service was slow. The waitress acted bothered when someone from the party made a request.

THE BILL: They added an 18% gratuity and some other mystery charge
( check your receipt for it)  When my friend confronted the waitress about this other fee, she was told that all places in Vegas charge this fee. Well, we ate at many other restaurants and never saw that added charge anywhere; CROOKS.

Lastly, when we paid our bill, in cash, the waitress never brought our change? When my friend asked where our change was she said, "We always keep the change." LOL! AS IF! 
We made her give us our change back. She reached into her apron pocket, grabbed an uncounted amount of coins and said, "Here." (the rest of that was, "Now go away!")

Go to Mon Ami Gabi, if you want superior food and a classy dining experience; it is only down the street, in front of The Paris hotel, and less expensive!
