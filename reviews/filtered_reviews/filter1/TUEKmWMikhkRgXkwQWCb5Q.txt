Overpriced for tapas style. Waiter could not really explain menu and menu was too complex for what you get. Waiter did inform us the menu has already been revised once since opening. Being open a month you would think they would have produce to make a salad. Three items we tried to order they could not make. You will be disappointed and still hungry if you only order one item on the menu. For two people expect to spend $90 plus. The concept sounds like a fun idea but so far Sumo Maya has poorly executed it. The music is obnoxiously loud and unnecessary. Oh and food comes from two kitchens so expect food to randomly appear at your table. The experience was like hanging at an old town bar except that is not the experience I want for dinner service. Parking is valet only and very limited so be ready to fork out a tip for the "complimentary" valet. Recommendation i s to not waste your time and money. Changes will need to occur before going back. For Asian just go to Tooties across the street.
