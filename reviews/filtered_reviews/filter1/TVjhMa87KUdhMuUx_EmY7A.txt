The re-modeling of the inside was nicely done but it stops there. Not the same food from the old El Sombrero. It should be called The Hat because it is not traditional Mexican Food. The chicken tacos were flavorless, shredded beef enchiladas were very dry along with the meat being tough. The tamal dish was saturated with an overpowering red sauce. Service was adequate, I asked for a white sangria and they brought me red sangria twice and the waiter also suggested to split a dinner plate but when he brought it out it was not done. I think I will stick to the other hole in the wall Mexican places in Vegas.
