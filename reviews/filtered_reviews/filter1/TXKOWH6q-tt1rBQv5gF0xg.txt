Slow service. Salsa tastes like Pace Picante out of a jar. Gross! Definitely not worth the discounted price of $5! Rosarita refried beans out of a can are way better! Rice is bland with a side of funk! Went here on a Wednesday night, so apparently not club night. The tacos are ok, but Del Taco is much better! Everything is overpriced as well... I wish i had checked Yelp before settling on this place. I would rather have gone to bed without dinner and filled up on watered down free drinks in the casino. Trust me when I tell you, if your hungry save your money and go someplace else!
