Club atmosphere could be great. Except when I had a table for my graduation I wasn't even allowed in because I was late but half my party was already there. Apparently all the tables were filled to capacity? Bulls$!?$. It's the fact that they let other people in who weren't in line too. Thanks El Hefe.
