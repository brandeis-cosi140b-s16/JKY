The $10 Cactus Pear Margarita was disgusting, it tasted like double-strength sugar syrup and sour mix.  Probably the WORST margarita I ever had.   I didn't try the other margaritas, but if this headache inducing sugar rush margarita made it onto the menu, then the others margarita are guaranteed to be over sweet premixed crap at best.
