I'm perplexed by all of the 4+ star reviews for this restaurant.  We were seated on the patio, which was nice.  The food was not impressive at all.  The Pollo Fundido that everyone raves about was dry and there wasn't enough of the jalapeno cream sauce.  I was dissapointed that when my daughter found hair in her food, they still charged us for the meal because they remade her plate.  The problem however, was my daughter had lost her appetite from seeing the hair and couldn't eat her food anyways.  

My husband ordered the lamb stew.  The sauce was seasoned well, but the lamb was very dry, just like my plate.  This restaurant was packed, so people must have good experiences here, but as for our family, we won't go back.
