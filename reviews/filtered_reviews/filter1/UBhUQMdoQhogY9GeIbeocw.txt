I guess by now all you people are so used to the crappy Mexican in phoenix that you think this is the max.  I guess to each his own but my Idea of good Mexican is not soggy tortillas, food that tastes like cumin a trashy dump that is not clean, there is no way you can clean a place like this they make enough money to at least put in a decent floor, but trust me you eat what you see.
