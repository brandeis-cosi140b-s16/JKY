Not the worst, but DEFINITELY not worth the trip north of strip! First off, the meat is NOT carne asada. It is chuck steak. The ordering system is horrible. Three lines for each meat. If you want more than two meats, then your food will be cold. The chile was whack. If you want real San Diego Mexican food, try Roberto's. It's opposite end of strip. In between Mandalay Bay and South Pointe. I've lived in SD before and they have the best! Better than. LA!!!
