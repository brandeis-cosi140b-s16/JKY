One word, Nasty. I came here with a large group on October 4th. The service was pretty poor (he did not clear dirty plates and kept on bumping me when handing over plates, drinks, etc). He also left our table halfway through taking orders to get drink refills for other table. The worst part was the food, bland, odd textures and just overall yucky. My friend and I both had food poisening and others felt really sick. Yuck, yuck, yuck!
