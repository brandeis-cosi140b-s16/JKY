Absolutely horrible.  If fact, I'm being dragged their on Sat., and I'm absolutely dreading it.  For some reasons a few friends seem to like the "ambience?"  Whatever.  Isn't iit nteresting that they don't mention the food?

First of all, in my opinion, there isnt' any ambience.  Most of the staff is rude, can't speak English, and, as evident by the scowl on their faces, surely wish they could be elsewhere instead of helping the damn gringos.  In all fairness to the remaining staff, they are friendly and try to be as helpful as possible.

The food is absolutely a greasy, tasteless, OVERPRICED mess.  Instead of ordering enchiladas or burritos, you're better off ordering a half pound of cheese and throwing it in your microwave.  It'll taste just about the same.  Awful!

This isn't a one time visit.  I've had the misfortune of being at Los Olivos five times.  Everytime it's been pretty much the same as described above.  And, every time I starve.  I refuse to pay for Taco Bell at Los Olivos prices.  Unfortunately, because of the close location to our workplace many of my coworkers choose this place for convenience sake.  

Anyone know of any better Mexican restaurants around I.S and Scottsdale Rd.?
