This was the second time we had visited La Rista. The first time service was extremely slow and they sat us in the bar next to a group of extremely loud intoxicated 21 year olds. Tonight we waited over an hour for a table after we were informed it was a 40 min  wait. Finally had to walk out. Definitely not going to give this place another chance.
