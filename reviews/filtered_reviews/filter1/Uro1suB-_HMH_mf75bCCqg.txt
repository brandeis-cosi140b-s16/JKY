This place was gross! My water tasted like a toilet. We ordered a cheese crisp, which was over cooked . The fajitas for two was more like for three ( could have gotten the regular size). I was excited when I first saw them because I was so hungry!! Then, I took a bite and was disgusted! I don't know what spices they use, but it is not good. Who can ruin fajitas? Usually I can tolerate any quality of Mexican food. Just put a little salsa on it and it will be edible. I tried a second bite and wanted to choke! I couldn't eat it. Even my husband thought they were bad but he choked them down. We didn't tell the server because we didn't want to complain. I ate the chips and salsa which was ok. My husbands beer came in a margarita glass. We sat on the patio, we were the only ones there, and it seemed like every five minutes one of the workers was opening the door to look at " something" in the back. I don't know if they were worried about us leaving or if they were waiting on a drug run;) The server was nice but slow and forgetful.  Additionally, the food is waaaayyyyyy over priced. You are much better off going to Raul and Theresa's or even filibertos....lol.
