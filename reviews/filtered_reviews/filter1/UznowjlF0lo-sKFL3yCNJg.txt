Great food worst service ever. So ordered wife and kids and myself food only 3 out of the 5 plates came out. Which the manger brought them. Apparently they didn't even put a order in for the other 2 small kids screaming for food so they said a crappy sorry then after I was done with my meal they finally brought out my child's plate only one thou even thou it was supposed to be 2 more. So after I pay the check they bring the last one. The funny thing even thou I was nice they knew I was pissed manger didn't even come over and fix there screw up and charged full price for everything thank great food but worst service ever!!!!!!
