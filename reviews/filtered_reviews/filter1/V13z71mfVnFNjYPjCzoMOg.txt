We went here because it was recommended by the locals and had good reviews in the tour guide book.  The patio was neat, with fun decorations. The mexican food was average. The salsa was too watery, just a little heat to it.  The  guacamole was good, it was creamy with small chunks of avocado in it. The pinto beans tasted like they came out of a can. One plus is they have pitchers of beer and margaritas. 
The one star is for the staff/service.  They were slow moving and never came back to the table to check on us after we got our food. It felt like we were inconveniencing them. They didn't give us a refill on the chips until we asked two different servers. Mind you, it was a small plastic basket to begin with, we were not total pigs. I paid an extra 3.50 for the guacamole, the least they could do was bring me some chips with it! 
I would pass on the food, hang out at the bar for a beer to get the atmosphere and move on. I would have been happier with the food and service at the Baja Grill across the street.
