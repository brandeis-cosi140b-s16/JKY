This place is an exact imitation of chipotle but a lot worse. After waiting 40 minutes in line the place was out of steak during the middle of the day on a Saturday. Employees were rude and tried to rush everyone with their orders. The least they could have done is inform everyone that they were out of a certain ingredient to avoid waiting in line. 

I ordered a burrito with chicken. The burrito barely had any meat in it and was overflowing with rice and beans. I was disgusted when I had seen their whole batch of guacamole was dark brown so I opted not to have it. The restaurant was also out of coke and their sprite tasted like water. Worst experience at a Mexican place and most definitely never coming here again. Go to chipotle trust me you'll be a lot more satisfied than eating at this place.
