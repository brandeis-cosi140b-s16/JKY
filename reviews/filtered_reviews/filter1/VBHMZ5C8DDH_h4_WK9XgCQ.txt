This place is located inside of the Flamingo. I am a betting man and I bet in a year or less this place will close. The drinks and the food are terrible. I wish I had lost my money gambling. If Yelp offered a 1/4 star I would have checked it. Go to Margaritaville you will get fantastic potent drinks and great  food. Adios Carlos and Charlie's. Never ever again!
