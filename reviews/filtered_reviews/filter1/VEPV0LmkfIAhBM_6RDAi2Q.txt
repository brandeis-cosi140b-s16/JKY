The food is okay..  But the service is terrible.  It took 7 minutes for them to bring our drinks... And thirty to get our food.  The server has only checked on us once.  The chips taste like they are out of the bag..  But hey The presentation is beautiful.  When you come to Vegas I think you should stick to the buffet.
