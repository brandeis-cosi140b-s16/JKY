I'm a big Alabama Crimson Tide fan and I heard they had the Las Vegas Alumni chapter here to watch the games on Saturdays.  It's a nice enough place with lots of parking.  However, that's where the good of this place ends.  The food is absolutely disgusting.  It tasted microwaved.   And the service is not good at all.  I sat at the bar first and then joined the alumni group.  It was awful both places.  I don't know why they chose this place for game watching, but I hope they change it for this upcoming season.  I have not been back there, and have no plans to go back there.  It was nasty.
