If this place is 4 1/2 stars then Yelp is not to be trusted. We went thinking great this will finally be a good Mexican restaurant... not so fast. Chips and salsa: chips tiny, salsa very salty. Mole sauce tasted straight out of a jar. Chilequillas, soggy, vinegary, watery with dry chicken. Chicken flautas: very dry chicken. I also have never heard of a Mexican restaurant that does not have burritos... really? WTH is that? Being from Cali we are looking for an excellent Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas, haven't found one yet, most are poor to average.
