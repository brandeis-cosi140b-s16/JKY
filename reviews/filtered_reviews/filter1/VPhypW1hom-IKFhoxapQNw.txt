Ok... I do not understand the cult following that this place has. I grew up in Mesa and have been dragged to this place several times only to wonder "WHY?" The food is ridiculously hot - not yummy hot - just hot! I like hot food but I want food that is delicious and digestable. The service sucks and the prices are a rip off.
