I went with a party of 5 and we split the bill among credit cards/cash.  The waiter (Michael P) overcharged the credit cards and said it was due to the original receipt not reflecting our drink prices.  I insisted that he print out the original receipt since I needed it for company expense tracking and sure enough, homeboy pocketed the cash and overcharged us in order to get a bigger tip!  The food is ok but not really worth the price plus I refuse to go back due to Michael P pulling a fast one on us.
