I am Blancos newest ex-customer for life. I have spent large amounts of money on work and family meals at Blancos.  Although the food is overpriced, the atmosphere has a good vibe (@Scottsdale blvd location). Unfortunately, today I stopped by the airport location in terminal 4. Before I could sit and relax on a very busy morning, the hostess with the mostess attitude noticed we had just came from Modern Burger next door. She said a server would be right over. Almost immediately a guy that looked like a derelict came over and asked us if we would  like to order. I explained that we are going to have our sandwich and would be ordering a drink in a minute. He proceeded to tell us to come back when we were ready to order.  I asked him why he was being so hostile at 7:00am with an empty restaurant. He then asked us to leave again. I was shocked. Apparently he has an issue with authority at home and has allowed it to carryover to work.  Needless to say, and after reading other reviews on this location, Blanco will fail miserably.  Upsetting patrons at the airport will surely impact their other locations.  They just lost well over a thousand dollars a year from me and my employer.
