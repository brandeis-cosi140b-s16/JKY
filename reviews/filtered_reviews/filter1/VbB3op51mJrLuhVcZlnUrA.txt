I found this place painfully disappointing. I have heard others praise it but it so boring. The food lacks imagination and complexity. When we arrived the mood lighting was so low that we could not see the menus- we actually had to hold them up to catch the light- we joked about it at the time but it was very annoying. I ordered a vegetarian burrito and found an abundance of beans and cheese accompanied by about 2 tsp of avocado and a dash of salsa. It was not in any way worth the money.  In addition, my friend ordered surf and turf and got 3 small shrimp and a small steak... I mean really the guy paid $20 for the meal, they could have at least given 5 measly shrimp. 

On the positive side, the building is pretty and they do give you a dessert if it's your Birthday. 

I'm not usually very critical but this place needs an honest critique. Don't go to this "Mucho" over priced "Bistro."
