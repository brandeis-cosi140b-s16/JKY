I come to cafe rio often, like 2-3 times a week. Love the food. It's laid back enough that I can take my 2 year old daughter.
I give it a 1 star because of their customer service. It's horrible. Not by all employees but most. At one point every time I came and picked up my food my order was always wrong. The employee in the food line never properly greets you. They look miserable. I have heard many times in standing in the line about similar issues from other people.
I have even called this store a few times to tell a manager about how I found bones in my chicken and how my order was once again wrong.
I also noticed each time I come I owe a new amount of money. I get the SAME exact thing every time. So I saved 6 recipes and yep prices ranged from $6-$22 nuts.

Also depending on who's working you will get a stamp on your stamp card. Then when I question why I don't get a stamp I get a rude response and told to have a great day.

Anyways I never write these things but I'm completely frustrated and sadly prob won't be coming back to this location.
