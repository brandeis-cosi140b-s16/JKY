Avoid this restaurant at all costs - because that is all it will do COST.  We went with a group of eight and the bill was insane for insanely small portions.  I ordered the 20 vegetable fried rice with chicken.  The vegetables must have been diced to a miniscule size, because I couldn't find all those vegetables  AND at $34 with tax and tip - not worth it.  The tacos are also so small- 2 bites.  Our friends ordered dessert and I laughed out loud when the waiter put it down.  It was a tablespoon sized portion.  The total bill came to about $400 and we were STILL hungry.  I've had amazing meals at commes ca and Milos both at the Cosmopolitan.  This restaurant was embarrassingly expensive and of inferior quality and can't even be discussed in the same breath.  Oh by the way everyone at our table had no problem spending a lot on a good mean, which we did the following night at Milos.  We just don't like being robbed for a shit meal.
