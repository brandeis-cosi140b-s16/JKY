One of the biggest disappointments of my trip. Sat at the bar around 10:30 with two other people. We were greeted and ID'd, then after about 10 minutes we were greeted and ID'd a second time. The bartender completely skipped someone when we were ordering our food. Appetizer took 20 minutes but then the entree that we ordered at the same time as the appetizer, took an additional 35. Service sucked, and food was less than mediocre.
