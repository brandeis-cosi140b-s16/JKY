Got the chicken burrito and girlie got a torta. Torta was good burrito was so small that I had to order a taco. When they say America's taco shop they mean that it's a redneck taco shop.

Quantity sucks, it's not authentic at all, and comes with a huge price lol.... 

Never coming here again. 

The service was nice
