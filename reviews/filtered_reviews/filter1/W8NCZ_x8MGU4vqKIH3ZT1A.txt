Here's a tip about 5-Star Yelp reviews:  When they start getting extremely specific about deals, specials, and how you can sign up for text alerts, 10/10 times they are written by employees driving the average rating up and bumping negative reviews down the page.  As evidenced by this page, El Hefe has clearly encouraged their employees to leave good reviews talking about salad and taco specials to compensate for the customer reviews about their establishment.  Now, as for my experience...

In line at about Midnight, I witnessed an individual be told 'hey man, sorry but no basketball shoes in here' and was told the same thing once I reached the front of the line.  Being a logical person, I look not for coincidences but for patterns, and the pattern here was curious being that there were clearly people inside the venue wearing flip flops, Chuck Taylor sneakers, Vans, and yes, 'basketball shoes.'

So where is the pattern?  What made those individuals exempt from the 'basketball shoes' rule?  Well, myself and the gentleman who were refused were both of African descent, while the individuals inside were of European descent.  Again, this is simply a pattern that is only logical to reach.  

When I asked about the 'basketball shoes' policy, each bouncer had a different response.  "Oh, flip-flops and Converse are ok" said one bouncer.  Another was aboslutely incredulous that I had noticed the pattern of race in the equation and said that Air Maxes were acceptable but not basketball shoes.  When I pointed out that I was wearing Air Max 1s, he was befuddled and stammered out a barely coherent response.  

Every dollar spent is a vote cast, and I won't be voting for a racist establishment anymore.  I've included in the album a picture of the European individual clearly wearing 'basketball' shoes.
