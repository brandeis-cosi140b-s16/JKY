Our waitress took forever to get the drinks, the chips, and our order. My wife got a margarita, for a mixed drink that comes from a tap, I guess it was okay. When I got my enchilada/taco dinner I was rewarded with a blandness of flavor you just don't get very often. The most interesting part of the meal was my friend who ordered the potato taco, it resembled a flattened dead rodent more than a taco. I'm amazed that she even took a bite of it. I did laugh heartily at her frowned expression after trying it, so it was good for comedic value.

I did go to the old Matta's a few years back and it was decent, but seriously, don't waste your time going here.
