Visited the Gilbert Restaurant tonight at 7pm.  Host was unfriendly, took 3 other tables before seating us (a table of 5).  We did our drink and food order at the same time.  After 30 minutes without food (3 adult meals and a kids meal.  2nd child did not eat) and two tables around us being seated and served drinks from the bar AND dinner, I went to the front to speak to a manager.  Manager said he would check on it and be back to me.  He never returned to me to check on us.  6 minutes later, our food was delivered.  We asked for extra napkins and a cup of water for my nephew.  Never received either.  The two tables around us that came in later were paying their checks while we were barely eating.  A simple dinner took over an hour.  No one apologized or explained why our food took so long.  We will not be returning to your establishment as I was completely disappointed in our experience.
