I don't see what everyone is talking about!  First off their ordering system sucks! You have to wait in three different lines depending on which meats you want. By the time you get your food from one line and have to order in the other your food is cold.  Then you still have to wait in another line to pay. Second, they use chuck steak!  A carne asada taco consists of flap skirt/Ranchera meat.  Third, the al pastor tasted like a piece of sweet thanksgiving ham and they smothered it with a green moco looking sauce. Fourth, the lengua was kept in a boiling pot of lard.  Lengua is boiled then kept steamed, not kept warm in lard.  The tripas tasted like they were not clean and when I asked if they were crispy he said, "yes", but were soggy.  The cabeza was also kept in the lard to keep warm.  I know mexican and this was not!  I come from Guadalajara where the street tacos are amazing and when I seen they had "Vampiros" I was super excited. Until they came out.  The cheese was not good and they packed it with a pound of pico de gallo that made what should have been a crispy tostada a soggy tortilla!  Will NEVER return!
