Seriously this place is WAY over priced.  The only cool thing price wise was the 3 dollar happy hour drink that changes by the wheel every hour.  Unfortunately they only have 1 bartender working so the odds of actually buying one is 1 in a 1000.  Food is so/so and not worth buying.  Worst of all was the most expensive daquiri bar in vegas, so couldnt even get a drink to go.  Cool idea, and location-unfortunately bad service, overpriced, and average food kills it.
