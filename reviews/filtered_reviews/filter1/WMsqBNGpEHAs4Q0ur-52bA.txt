This place was a huge disappointment to say the least.  Ordered the machaca burrito plate which came with rice and beans.  Everything was very bland.  The machaca was mushy (not even sure how you get it that way).  Made me wonder if it was frozen then microwaved or something.  Needless to say I won't be back
