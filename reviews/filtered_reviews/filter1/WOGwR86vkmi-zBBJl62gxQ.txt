Check list: Dirty floors, sticky cheap sliver ware, sticky menus, bad server, tasteless "Mexican" food. Just to name a few!
Guess you can make a living selling food to AllWhiteTukee that makes Taco Bell look like a five star restaurant! 

Pluses: Atmosphere, chips, & ice. Only good things in this place.
