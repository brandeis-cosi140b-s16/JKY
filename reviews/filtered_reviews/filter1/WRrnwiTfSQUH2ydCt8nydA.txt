I really wish I was able to write a review of the food, but all I was able to taste was the delicious pomegranate margarita and the so so queso dip.  The chips were delicious by the way.
Our issue was our wait time of over an hour and a half with empty tables that needed cleaned.  Upon arrival we were told an hour and 15 minutes which is long but when tables were available and we were still waiting...that's when we left. I hope to return to give a proper review someday.
