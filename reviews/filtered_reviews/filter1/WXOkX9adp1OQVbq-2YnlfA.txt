Did you change owners or managers? We used to love this place and visited every time that we were in Phoenix. Well known for the very HOT and delicious food, we were very disappointed on our recent visit. The food was not spicy at all, so much for those who like it hot, which is their logo!! One of our guests was even served a large portion of FAT (more than half of the meat in the meal) in their carnitas, you would have thought that the cooks would have seen this and not served it!! Will not be coming back next time.
