DO NOT BUY BOTTLE SERVICE HERE.... We called ahead and reserved a table.  They told us the table was 1 bottle minimum .  We usually get 1 bottle of grey goose and then just order drinks and shots from our server (spending just as much as a bottle).  

Server was pouring EXTRA drinks without putting mixer in them and leaving them on the side of the table. Then I noticed her take one of them away as if it was an empty. 

Our server was also pouring very heavy, I don't usually mind and understand the server wants the bottle to finish quicker so we buy more. 

Once the bottle ran out the server told us we needed to buy another one. We said we would rather just run up a tab and buy shots, mixed drinks, etc etc.  (there was 8 of us and we would have easily ran up more money than a bottle in the same time frame of drinking a bottle).  

THE SERVER TOLD US TO GET OFF THE TABLE SINCE WE ARE NOT BUYING ANOTHER BOTTLE....  This has never happened at Revolver, Smashbox, Firehouse, Axis, or American Junkie.. We said we would be running up an equal amount, she said the only way she would allow us to stay is if each of us racked up a $200 tab. 


Cliffs:
Server was constanting pouring extra drinks and leaving them around our table.
Server booted us from table for not buying another bottle even though we were willing to run up higher $$ tab.
