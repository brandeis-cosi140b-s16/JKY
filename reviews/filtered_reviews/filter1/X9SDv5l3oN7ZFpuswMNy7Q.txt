I've never regretted spending 20 dollars the way I have after this place. I should of been warned by the empty restaurant, I wish I was those kind if people that have no shame and cause a scene demanding there money back!! Oh how I want my money back :( lol ... the rice is hard and crunchy and different colors (jerk rice) the jade chicken that is oh so recommended as there #1 seller,  is stale and dry,  I could bet money that most of the food on my plate was old, it wasn't even warm. Also had the carnitas quesadilla, please stay away. I feel sick, the flavor caused me to feel discomfort at thought of eating, so hard to explain.  The staff was nice, but thats about it. P.s. the sugar cookie or whatever it is that they give was also stale. I would of been better off eating at McDonald's ordering from the dollar menu. . . 
Ohhhh how those 20 dollars hurt my heart.  Lol
