On May 3, 2015 my husband and I visited Carlito's at 11am. The counterhelp taking our order was unattentive, surly and unfocused. The older woman didn't notice us standing infront of her for 2 minutes. The younger Caucasian woman didn't get our order right after repeating it 3 times. She kept looking past us (rough night/morning. )

Tm backhe young woman didn't bring me my drink and charged me. I told her that I had ordered it. After all I repeated our order 3 times and this young woman said okay at least twice.  She "gave" the beverage to me like she was doing me a favor.

My dish was so unappealing I couldn't eat it. The flavor was unappetizing and our sopapilla was soggy. After the drink incident I felt unmoved to complain but I will definitely think twice about eating at Carlito's again.

Management: have a meeting with your counterhelp concerning customer service.
