My bf and I just ate here. We are staying down the road and wanted a good authentic Mexican meal. Phoenix is full of Mexican restaurants and its hard to choose but let me tell you this is one to avoid. It was gross. I had 2 tacos one enchilada. The carne esada taco was ok but everything else was salty and soggy.  We were the only people in the place but it was an odd hour at 3p . I will not be back.
