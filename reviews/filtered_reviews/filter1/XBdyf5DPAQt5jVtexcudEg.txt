Used to love coming here to the point I was the duke. Quality of the food has dropped significantly. I gave them 4 additional tries after the first bad experience to see if they changed but alas it still was gross. One time they even served raw fish once to us. Such a sad thought I won't be trying this place ever again. Do yourself a favor and just go to Zabas.
