The hostess and ID checker were very helpful in helping us chose a good tequila, that is the only nice thing i'll say about this place. The 2 bartenders ladies were unfriendly and unhelpful, (just plain snotty).  CHECK YOUR BILL CAREFULLY, THEY GAVE ME A BILL THAT WAS MORE, AND WHEN I QUESTIONED HER SHE HAD THE RIGHT BILL UNDER THE INCORRECT BILL.
