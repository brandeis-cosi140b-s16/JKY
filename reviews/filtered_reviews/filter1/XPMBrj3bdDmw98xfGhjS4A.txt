I ate here a month ago and am certain that it gave me the worst food poisoning of my life. I kinda want to give it another chance because everyone I know loves it so much... But I am haunted by the memories of pooping my guts out for 8 hours straight that I will never trust the Chinese Bandit again. Eat here with caution.
