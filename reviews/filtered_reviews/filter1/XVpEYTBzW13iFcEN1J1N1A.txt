With all the hype of this place I thought it would be way better. I'll admit I do not eat Mexican food often but when I do it doesn't taste like this place. 

My gf & I ordered two meals & two margaritas that came up to the total of $45!! REALLY 

The margaritas were fruity & not strong at all/food was bland/atmosphere were four dudes drinking at the bar & two other tables with 40 yr olds at them not talking very much 

The waitress/staff was cool & explained to me how to "comp" my bill since I was staying at HRH other than that my experience there was let's eat this overpriced food & get out of here to go get real drinks. 
Food came fast & was hot but totally not worth the price 

The chips/salsa were good & tasted really fresh they also gave you three types of salsa to go with it but the salsa wasn't too good either. Maybe it's me but I just don't get this place or the hype 

Would I eat here again? NO 
Would I drink here again? HECK NO
