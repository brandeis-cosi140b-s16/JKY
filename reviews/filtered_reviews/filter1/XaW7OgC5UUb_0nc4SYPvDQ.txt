This place has gone to down hill in the last year. I used to come here once a week, then biweekly, then monthly, now here and there. Today the chicken had to be soaked in 4 cups of salt. Had to choke down the tacos I ordered. Rather eat that then change the order cause the awesome staff will have you wait 10 mins and then miss the order. Now they had a coke bottle on display on the edge of the counter with a stupid sticky note "now selling" that another customer knocked over on accident, CAUSE IT WAS ON THE EDGE! Then they clean up the glass but not the coke so it's now sticky all over the floor. Napkins, straws and lids all left over the floor. Garbage cans overflowing and the staff screwing up your order 99.9% of the time! No thanks, rather go to chipotle or qdabo as it's much better and your food isn't drenched in grease. The owner should really analyze this place and evaluate the staffing.
