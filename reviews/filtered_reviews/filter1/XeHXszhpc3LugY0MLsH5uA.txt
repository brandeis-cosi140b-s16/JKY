Ok...change if heart here...Well...if you have a party of eaters and not big afternoon drinkers you will get told to move to a less desirable table.  Even if you're a fat tipper...or would have been prior to being told to move so the alcohol party could have you table in front of the big screen. Hmmmmm...and you can reserve a cabana if you -commit to spending at least $200 if you fall sorry of the $200 you must purchase a gift card to make up the difference. Seriously?  Id rather just rent it out than be told what I have to spend to sit there.
