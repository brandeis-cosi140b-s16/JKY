Yes, the view is great but you don't need to eat the lousy food to get the view. Park and stand outside in the parking lot. You won't waste your money.

The coca cola pork had so much fat it was almost inedible. A knife couldn't even cut the meat. The whole fish was so dry it was tough to even get through the shell to any meat. 

We were there with an out-of-town guest and she was paying. When the poor quality meat was pointed out, they took a few dollars off the bill. We were too embarrassed to complain and ruin the evening. 

They should be ashamed of the food. The only thing good was the view. Shame, shame, shame.
