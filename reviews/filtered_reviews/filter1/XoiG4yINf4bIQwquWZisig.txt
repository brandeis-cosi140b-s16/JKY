We turned into the parking lot a little sooner than we should have and as such we drove by a Taco Bell.  As we did so I commented that if all else fails we could go to Taco Bell.

As we drove through the lot we finally saw the place, parked and entered.  We were immediately seated and soon the chips and salsa arrived.  In short YUCK!!  Chips were stale and the salsa wasn't appreciably better.

Ordered a diet coke and tea.  In short YUCK!!  Tea went back in favor of another diet coke.

Next we ordered...2 tortas...Ranchera de pollo o res (with steak) and a Carne Asada.  As I figured out later I got the wrong sandwich (mine should have had chips but didn't) but at the end both sandwiches were the same albeit what should have been mine had cucumbers, radishes, etc vice chips.  So a couple of observations...every other Carne Asada torta I've ever had came with chopped meat vice strips (quite wide strips).  Moreover, it this is how they do it then other the sides, and as mentioned already, there was NO FRIGGIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SANDWICHES...WTF!!!!!!  As for the sandwiches themselves...YUCK!!!

There are far too many places to get a far superior torta in the Valley.  In short, I should have gone to Taco Bell.
