Hours are listed til 11pm...busy bar and still pouring drinks but not allowing any new customers in as of 9:12pm. It is a Tuesday night, but there are many other travelers in the terminal...and no other options for a beer before my flight that is an hour away. The airport should require they remain open until at least ten if there are no other choices. I could have stopped before passing through security had I known their posted hours were inaccurate. I work in hospitality and would completely understand if they were very slow and chose to close at a reasonable time, but 9:12pm is ridiculous!
