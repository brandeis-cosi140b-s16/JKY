Jeanine is the WORST waitress. If you are having a bad day or you hate your job either find a new one or don't show it at work when you work with the public!! We order our drinks and we get half of the order, while she is standing by the computer with the other 2 for 15 minutes. We ask the hostess for our drinks and she brings them to us right away! We then wait another 10 minutes before Jeanine comes to take our order only because we had to tell the hostess that we were ready. We finally get our food and we needed a refill so Jeanine brings us the drinks that were sitting on the counter next to the computer for 30 minutes!! We then tell the hostess again what happened so she told Jeanine and took our drinks away about 10 minutes later she brings us "fresh" drinks from what we are told. The food is great but the service by Jeanine is HORRIBLE.
