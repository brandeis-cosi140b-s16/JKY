As I arrived, I asked the Hostess if the patio was open seating, she acknowledged it was and we preceeded to choose a table in the right corner of the patio next to their water display.  After ten minutes had passed, a member of my party attempted to signal the waiter, as he was seemingly scanning the patio.  After fifteen minutes of waiting we left our table and exited the establishment without so much as a goodbye.  I called the location to inform them of my lack of service and after being on hold or ten minutes, I spoke with Gabe (Manager) who offered to "assist" me the next time I returned, if I identified myself to him.  I instead chose to patronize a tried and true establishment in Chandler known as CK's.  In my fifteen minute patio experience at CK''s I was greeted, my drinks were served, and my appetizer and two entrees all arived in less than fifteen minutes.
