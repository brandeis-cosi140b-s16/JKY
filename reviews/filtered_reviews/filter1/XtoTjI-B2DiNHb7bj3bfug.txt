If you don't want buffets in Vegas but you still want a meal that would fill you up, China Poblano is not a place for you. Basically the portions were extremely small considering the prices you had to pay. The most disappointing dish we had was the Mongolian beef dish. We thought we were going to have a full meat dish. It ended up looking like a salad dish with more lettuce than meat in it, and the meat were in extremely small sizes. I also saw the face of our neighbor's when he got the same dish. He was shocked just as we were when he received the dish. I thought Chinese and Mexican food usually serve big portions. Not here. It's definitely not worth your money for a middle class family. I was still hungry after the meal. This is an embarrassment for such a beautiful hotel that just opened for a week...I felt kind of cheated eating here. Instead, I recommend to take your money to the Cosmo. buffet.
