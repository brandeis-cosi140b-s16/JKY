I came here about 6months ago and it was great I had a huarache de Asada which was delicious!
But I'm back 6 months later and I ordered a carne Asada sope which was horrible the meat was inedible it was way too salty it made my mouth feel like sand paper out of how salty it was I told our waiter and his explanation was simply that's how the meat is seasoned (over seasoned) and the sope itself was not cooked through! Not coming back its way to over priced and the food is not worth it!  0 stars!
