Bad service? How about NO SERVICE! I was at the "Sodium Chloride Stuffed Female" for 3.5 hours and never once was I approached by a server, greeted, offered a menu or asked if I needed anything; for three and a half hours!! I saw plenty of servers; young ladies more interested in chatting up the young men at the next table over, but never once was approached. Even the bartender seemed bothered to open a couple of bottles of beer for me and my lady. And bottle were all they had. Even the tap system wasn't working and there was no draft beer!!! 

It's too bad, really, how crappy this place is on service. With an outdoor volley ball court, fire pits, and more, I would have really enjoyed lingering and coming back. As it was, the only reason we were there was a friend's birthday. But since I was never offered food, or drinks, one server even just walked past out table as we yelled "Shots! Shots!" And would have just walked away if we hadn't grabbed her and demanded service. This place must be losing $1000s of dollars a night if they treat others the way they treated us. I won't be going back to a place that clearly doesn't value it's customers. I can put up with a lot if I can get good service, but the Salty Se√±orita isn't worth tolerating.
