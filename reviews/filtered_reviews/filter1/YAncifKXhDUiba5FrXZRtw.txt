me: remember we talked about where to go night one?  
blue agave looked good 
gardunos looked like gross tex-mex chain
 
Brette: yes

me: so my boss wants blue agave too
and we meet downstairs to find it
and we walk by gardunos
 
Brette: ok

me: it looks gross
and we end up going around the entire casino floor
NO BLUE AGAVE!
so we ask a Palms employee

Brette: ok...
 
me: and he says, "See the neon tequila sign?"
"It's there"
Oh...ok So this place is right next to Gardunos, and there's no sign
so we walk up and get seated
we're excited for Blue Agave

Brette: ok

me: So we get our menus, and what does it say on the cover? Where are we?
GARDUNOS!
wtf
 
Brette: oy
what'd you do?
 
me: stayed
apparently, blue agave is the special menu at Gardunos
the stuff you saw online (Palms website)
 
Brette: that doesn't make sense?
was it mediocre?
 
me: terrible
 
Brette: oy
 
me: terrible
I was wondering why there was only one yelp review of blue agave
when I was researching in my room
 
Brette: i hope there are 2 now

me: now I know.
The Palms website deceives!
 
Brette: dude, you gotta yelp that
 
me: maybe I'll just copy and paste this chat in there

Brette: haha
it's not worthy of an actual review
 
me: But I'll get lots of "funny" and "cool"
and maybe some "useful"

Brette: haha
