Tries to pass as a traditional Mexican food restaurant, but fails miserably. You have to pay for chips and salsa? I think not. What happened to real silverware and plates? I thought I was at the taco bell in terminal 4. The food would be alright if it was a fast food joint and half the price, but they charge the same if not more than most full service traditional Mexican food restaurants. AVOID!
