***Do NOT waste your money!***

We went here for a birthday dinner and it was our first time eating here and since we were staying in Planet Hollywood we decided to give it a try. The decor was really pretty and I did like the vibe, but it was kind of empty so that should have told us something. I ordered shredded beef enchiladas and my cousin ordered the carne asada tacos. They both cost about $15 each and came with black beans and cilantro rice. 

When the food came the rice was cold on both our plates and the food was not well seasoned. The shredded beef tasted like pot roast and the black beans tasted like they came out a can. 

The only good thing that I can say about the place was that when I told the manager the food was not good, after I took two bites, she agreed and we immediately left without having to pay.
