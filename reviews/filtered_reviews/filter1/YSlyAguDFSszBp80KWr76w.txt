My husband and I went here the day after our wedding and it was super busy for lunch. The service was terrible. Also this place gave my husband food poisoning and he spent the rest of our honeymoon in the bathroom and ruined our trip. He ordered the chicken tacos. I tell everyone that goes to vegas to avoid this place at all costs.
