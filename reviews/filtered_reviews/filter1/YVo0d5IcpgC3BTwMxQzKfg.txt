We purchased combo dinner and show tickets to eat then see divas. The service was probably the worst I have ever had. We truly felt that because we had a pre fixe menu the server wanted nothing to do with us. We had to flag people down for help (salt, a drink, a fork) then those things never came. Our female server who needs an attitude adjustment then announces she's going on a break 40 minutes before our show started and "Timothy" would take over. O over the next 30 minutes we never saw Timothy nor did he offer us any help. Our dessert took over 30 minutes to come out as it was now 915 for a 930 show we had to ask some miscellaneous person for help thankfully that server was kind ...when our original female server with the long hair came back she came over and said I heard there was a problem here... we explained the problem she walked away and not apologize for anything. The meal well Taco Bell is much better. We all had to ask for sour cream to cover up the extremely dry shredded chicken (not to mention I got the wrong meal but was afraid to send it back). We ordered chips and salsa we never received. Our name was never on the list for having purchased the combo and they didn't even care or take anything with regard to proof so our thoughts on being treated poorly because of this purchase were probably true. Would never recommend this place (except for the churros)
