If there's a word that sums up Carlos & Charlie's it's tasteless.

Not that there's shennangians going on in here (the fiesta seems kind of forced) but the food is tasteless. When the server comes up and offers unsolicited a bottle of Tabasco to give the burrito some flavor, you know that they know that the food here sucks. 

I ended up going here 3 times during my visit because I was getting back to the hotel late and the coffee shop now only is open beyond breakfast and lunch on Friday & Saturday nights, and every time I left wishing I had decided to walk somewhere else that was serving food. the "famous" BBQ consists of slathering sickeningly sweet BBQ sauce on chicken, ribs, and shrimp and broiling it. (I'm from Texas, I know BBQ, and this ain't it.) The Mexican entrees have no flavor (see above Tabasco incident on a burrito that was supposed to have chorizo). The only entree that was passable was the steak medallions, and at $22 I really don't want to recommend them.

Also, don't be fooled by the 2 for 1 drink coupons they pass out during the week. The margaritas are $10 and very small, so getting 2 house frozen margaritas (or two Coors Lights for $10 is no deal. Also, don't be fooled by the Big Mama drinks they serve; the actual drink inside the glass is maybe a pint in total and most of the giant cup is molded plastic and air.

Service is lackluster. Seriously, don't go here.
