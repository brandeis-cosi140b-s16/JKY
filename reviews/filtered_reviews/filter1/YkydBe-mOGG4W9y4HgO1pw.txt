Let's start with the positives (of which there are few): the $7 margaritas were delectable. A true Mexican delight.

Sadly, it is here where the positives end. We (a party of 4) arrived hungrier than a group of overworked migrant workers and eager to satisfy our palettes with the heavily promoted Gobblerito. Little did we know, our evening would take a turn for the worse.

When we crossed the border into the dining establishment, we were given an estimate of 15-20 minutes until we would be seated. Let me tell you, when passing time with an irritable stoner who wants nothing more than to rest his weary legs, every minute feels like an eternity. After a half hour of standing with no food or drinks to show for our journey, our efforts began to feel fruitless. To keep morale up, the decision was made to order a round of margaritas before happy hour ended. What came next was the lone bright spot in an evening filled with disappointment and broken promises. The margaritas were an oasis of elation in a dessert of sadness. But the exuberance did not last long. Shortly after, we learned that a table had been vacant the entirety of our stay. However, the restaurant's laws stipulated that only a party of 5 could immigrate to the table. We. Were. Livid. No bueno.

Long story short, we waited for an hour to no avail. Don't go there.
