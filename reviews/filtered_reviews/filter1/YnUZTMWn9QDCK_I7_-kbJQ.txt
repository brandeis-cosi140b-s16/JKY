We have been to Diego's a few times in the last 2 years and the food has always been decent. The meal we had on Thurs 9/13/12 was almost inedible. The guacamole made tableside tasted very strange - it had too many sun dried tomatoes in it and was chewy. We ordered carnitas as entrees and it was salty beyond belief. I literally could not eat it and had to send it back for a different choice, which I never do. The waitress was extremely accommodating and brought me a different dish, which was better but not great. Our server told the kitchen about the carnitas and they actually took it off the menu for the night. Also the decor was a bit too RED. My eyes hurt from staring at the red walls all night!
