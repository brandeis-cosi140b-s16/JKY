I am not impressed. Friendly staff, our server Brandon was very attentive and couldn't have asked for better. The food was so bland, with no seasoning. The salsa taste like it was from a jar. I would never come here again. They need to hire new cooks that can help them make a more authentic menu. The chimichanga is not fried, it's more like a grilled burrito.
