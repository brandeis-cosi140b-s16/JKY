This place should be avoided at all costs!  Expensive, small portions and underwhelming flavor on all dishes.  Only tried the asian food here, but everything was unacceptable!

The food-
portions are TINY; consider everything you order as an appetizer sized.  
flavor-where did it all go?

When Pigs Fly-came out warm not hot.  no unique flavor to speak of.  
Dan Dan Mian-joke!-no flavor; nothing special;tiny
Dancing Eggplant-1 asian eggplant-unimpressed sause
Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice -more like steamed rice.  no flavor.  worse than what your white friends can dish up
Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich-soo bad bun was the best part

Service-none to speak of.  Couldn't fill my glass.  unattentive and clearly didn't give to be there.  


The good-
view of people cooking?-if your into that

ok-

bad-
everything from the service to the food and flavor.  if you like tiny expensive unfavorable portions this place is for you
