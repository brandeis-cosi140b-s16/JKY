DO NOT GO HERE! The hostess was polite enough when she informed us that she would not seat our party until all of us were present. There were four out of seven present and nearly all of the tables were empty on a Tuesday at 6pm. We had family in from out of town and wanted to catch up for an hour before the rest of everyone could join us. Once I explained this, the manager returned to again state like a robot that this was just policy. Well Germans had policies about people too, and they were just as inflexible!

This place used to be a great restaurant even a couple months ago. This completely has changed my mind on where to go to get my Mexican food fix.
