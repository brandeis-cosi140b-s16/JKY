Love original Barrio Cafe and Barrio Queen in Scottsdale so thought airport Barrio was a blessing.  Had a bowl of posole and SMALL glass of wine for 26 (before tax and tip). Flight delayed so order the  "large" 8 oz wine. Get the ck-$22.74. For ONE average size/quality glass of wine.  OUTRAGEOUS. The staff shares that owners been spotted once in whole time since place is open. Way to rip off your loyal local customers.
