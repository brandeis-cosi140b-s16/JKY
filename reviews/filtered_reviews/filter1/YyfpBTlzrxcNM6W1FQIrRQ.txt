Just left Taco Guild.
The building is great, but there is nothing else good about this place.
We ordered two taco.  the Happy hour taco was a sloppy joe  and we ordered
a lamb taco off the regular menu.  The waitress who brought the tacos presented the pastor taco (not order) and it turns out not delivered. We did receive the two tacos we ordered. The lamb was the better of the two, but had they been served at least warm
they would have been better.  
The table next to us had food over the surface, the plates and been cleared, but the
table not cleaned.  When we left 45 minutes later, we informed the hostess(?), she
didn't really care that the table was still dirty.
Then we are over charged.  The waitress thought the lamb and the duck (which
we were charged for) were the same price.  After asking her to look at the menu
she agreed they were not the same and adjusted the bill!
Someone need to train the staff and the person at the door (normally the hostess)!!
We will not return.
