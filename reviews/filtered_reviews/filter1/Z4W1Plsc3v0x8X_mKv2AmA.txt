If you are an animal lover, boycott this restaurant!
I went in for dinner after work. I walked in behind a woman who had parked in a take-out only spot, and I happened to notice a dog inside the car, windows opened a few inches, as I walked by. I didn't think much of it, as I figured she was actually getting take-out. WRONG. Maybe 10 minutes later, I notice she is sitting at a table ordering food! I go up to the manager and tell him that while she parked in a take-out spot, she is eating in the restaurant WITH HER DOG SITTING IN THE HOT CAR. He shrugs and says it is a "sticky situation" and he is not going to do anything. The hostess says, "Mike!" and goes and picks up the phone. I go sit back down, but after a few minutes, am too antsy to just sit there, walk back outside and see the car and dog are still there (just to make sure I had it right) and walk back inside and confront the manager again, asking if he called the police. He says no, as he "didn't see anything", but since I witnessed it I could call the police myself. I asked him if he ever heard of a thing called animal cruelty, and turned and walked out, calling 911 and checking on the dog, who seemed ok but was still panting. 
The manager comped my meal for the "situation" (according to my waiter), but his behavior was inexcusable. My family have been regulars at this location and the Ahwatukee location for a long time, but I cannot continue spending money at a restaurant where they blatantly ignore something like this.
