I saw a similar review to what I am about to write from Bill F down below and I just have to agree and say the same and add to it. 

Went there on 6/12/13 ... service is HORRIBLE. Went around 9:15 at night still 45min before closing. There are 6 people behind the counter doing work, except actually helping us out. Finally one of them decides to help us (there are two of us no one else in line) Was about the slowest process I've ever seen in my life. took us over 15 min to get through. Part of the problem was NO ONE was helping him. I asked a question about the desserts (as he was making my food) so he had to stop what he was doiong ask, go get someone, etc ... instead of her just taking the initiative.

So Service was SLOWWW.

Food was OK, above a taco bell but does that really say much?

I asked if i could have black beans with my quesadilla, apparently it doesnt come with it and I can't have that. We also bought a burrito and apparently hot sauce is an extra cost, really hot sauce?

Anyways this was my 3rd time and last time there.
