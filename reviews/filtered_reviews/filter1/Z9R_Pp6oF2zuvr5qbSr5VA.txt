I went there last night, and both my boyfriend had a bad experience.
Let's start with we got the appetizers.
Decent Appetizer Platter... minus the fact that it was cold.
Margaritas- Okay nothing amazing.
Cheese Crisp- Good Flavor, but hard to chew

The service/waitress was kind of rude, and wasn't very attentive even on the aspect of a glass of water.

We just figured we had a bad time and would try it again, that was until 2 am the next morning when he was puking his soul out.
