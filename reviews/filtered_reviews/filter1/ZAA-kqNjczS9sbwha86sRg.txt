I just don't get why everyone goes crazy for this place, we went here for lunch and I had hear a lot of good thing about this place so I was looking forward to it 
I order the Asada tacos, let me tell you, Meat had no flavor , salsa needed salt n pepper  big dissapoinment  Damn even the gas stations out here in California have better tasting tacos ,  I think this place should stick to eatheir Mexican or Korean and focus on the flavors.      Not worth your money. This place has nothing on tacos el gordo
