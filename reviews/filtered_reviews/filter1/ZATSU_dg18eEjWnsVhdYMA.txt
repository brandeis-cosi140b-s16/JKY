They're going to have to try harder. Very bland, the salsa sampler we had tasted watered down, the meat in my barbacoa tacos was very tough and my husband's chili relleno didn't have any filling in it. Really disappointed, there were a lot of other places we could've chosen on the strip.... Most disappointing Mexican food I've ever had.
