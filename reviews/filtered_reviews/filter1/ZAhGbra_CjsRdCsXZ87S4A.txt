The service here on 5/25/14 was bad. The guy seemed to only focus on me (another guy) and not my fiance. Instead of asking if we wanted more to drink he'd just come and grab our cups.

The chips and salsa, in my opinion, are terrible. The beans are ok.

We didn't like the food at all. Will not be coming back.
