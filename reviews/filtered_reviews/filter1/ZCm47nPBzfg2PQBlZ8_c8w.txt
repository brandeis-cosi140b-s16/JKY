my friend and I went to dinner tonight and it was great; they had a live band in the bar, "The Real Thing", who were amazing; the reason for the one star was because of a waitress who ruined our night!  We were in the bar at least 20 minutes when we finally waived the waitress down (who passed by us at least six or seven times ignoring that we were even there), and ordered drinks. The waitress, Jessica, was totally rude and seemed to be irritated with us before we even ordered. She was obviously having a bad night and took it out on us.  What's happening to common courtesy and customer service?? Jessica shouldn't be in this position if she is going to have such a disrespectful attitude toward the general public, leave it at home...
