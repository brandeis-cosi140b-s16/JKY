This review is strictly about the happy hour which I have never come for before. Anyhow, it basically sucks because for food there are only 4 tacos and the Rajas tacos is the same price it normally would be which makes no sense of how its "happy hour". I wish they had maybe few more happy hour food options. Also I'm surprised they don't serve chips and salsa like most Mexican restaurants, I means it fine but it would be a plus!
