Some like it hot.. but some like it not (me)

Yes, I can't handle heat, but it doesn't mean the food has to taste flavorless right?

Man, my wife and I were looking for good Mexican food for the second straight night in Arizona.  This place was not, here's why..

I ordered their Roasted Pork Tostada w/ taco, as it was one of the few mild items on the menu that the owner or manager did not feel to even care about, as he took my wife's order (I forgot what she had) and then mine, he was like you can't hang with the big boys? and his attitude was like ok, whatever and when I got my meal, the food tasted to me like ok, whatever.  I mean, if the food doesn't have spices, you should at least have season in it, as it was completely bland.  Poor pork, it was roasted so well and the rest of the tostada and taco were done perfectly, but without seasoning (salt), it goes no where; it should not be allowed to walk outside, as it had no clothes on type of analogy.

They placed no care on their mild items and what's sad is Bobby Flay likes them.  On top of that, my wife's dish had the spices, but even that, hers lacked seasoning as well.

This place we would not come to again and Bobby Flay, I don't trust him anymore.

Oh yeah, the drinks were not that good.  I had the Sangria Margarita, don't let it fool you, it looked great and sounded great, but it tasted sour.

The wait staff were rude and they ignored our table a lot.  I understand they were busy, but hello, we are here.. do I need to set a trap for them to stand next to our table? like to be nice, super glue?

The waitress at the end accepted our gift card, but when it did not cover the whole amount, she acted like we couldn't pay.. what the heck? fool!

Thanks for the free Cheese Crisp, but man, it is just an unfolded cheese quesadilla.

Nothing special.
