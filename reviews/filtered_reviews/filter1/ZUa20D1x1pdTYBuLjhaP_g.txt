Me and my wife went to san felipes cantina in Tempe AZ Saturday 6/28/08 they wouldnt let me in becouse I have my daughters name tattoo on my neck, they said just that day management told the workers not to let people in with tattoos above there shoulders. So becouse if this kind of stereotype or racism I rate san felipes cantina in Tempe AZ zero stars. And the worst bar in AZ
