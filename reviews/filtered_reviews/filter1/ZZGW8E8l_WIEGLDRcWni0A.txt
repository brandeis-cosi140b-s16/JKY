I purchased a Groupon to try this place out, and it was a huge mistake. I showed it to our server up front, and our total bill came to about $40. When I paid, I handed over my credit card and the Groupon. The server went in the back to talk to his manager, and then came back to our table. He told us that the manager would not accept the Groupon, and that he had charged the full amount to my card. When I asked to speak with the manager, our server's response was "he won't come out, he's too angry to talk with you". What?

The food was decent, but we left feeling angry and disrespected. Don't waste your time with this place.
