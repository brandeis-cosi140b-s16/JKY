Start off with positive great food. HORRIBLE service. When you order over the phone there is no point they still make you wait in luch rush line so your food is cold by the time you pick up. The beef tacos are never the same sometimes they are shredded beef sometimes hamburger its a suprise. The cashier is rude unfriendly and over charged my card. The price they quote you over the phone doesnt match price when you get in store you order $1 tacos all of a sudden when you get there only the soft corn tortillas are a $1 not the hard or flour tortilla which they should have told you.
