Came in on a Saturday at noon.  The Tempe Festival of the Arts was going on so they should have been swamped!  Not the case... That should have been my first clue.

They're a Mexican restaurant so I thought I'd order a margarita.  I asked the waitress what kind of tequila they had and she said "Jose Cuervo".  For anyone that knows tequila, that's not a real tequila.  I asked her if she had anything that was 100% de agave.  Nope.  I ended up with water.

I then order the chorizo and eggs that were on special.  Good price but terrible quality! There was no flavor.  Chorizo is sausage and for anyone that's ever eaten good sausage it's packed full of flavor!  Unfortunately, I was so hungry I didn't even care.  So I scarfed it down and vowed never to eat there again.
