Loud, annoying music.  Asked for it to be turned down since you could not even hear to share a conversation with someone.  Two people at the table next to us thanked us since they were annoyed by it too.  Five minutes later the volume was turned back up.  My husband asked if it could be turned back down.  The girl at the front counter said the manager told her to turn it back up.  My husband then asked to speak to the manager.  The manager told him they had to keep the volume high.  Okay, bye-bye Chipotle off Rainbow and 215!!!  There are numerous other restaurants in the area that would love to have our business.  We will not attempt to eat there again.  The only reason I can think they would do this is to get you out of there fast.
