I've been going to this restaurant for years but a different location.  This was my first time here Saturday afternoon and we had the worst service.  When my friend and I were seated they gave us water but never asked us for drinks.  We had to ask our waitress over to order drinks then again flag her down to place our order 20 minutes later.  Once the kitchen delivered our meal, we never saw our waitress again.  We had to flag down someone else to refill our water and once again to get our check.  We were completely ignored while we were there.  Worst service ever, very disappointed.  I'll continue to go to the Henderson location.
