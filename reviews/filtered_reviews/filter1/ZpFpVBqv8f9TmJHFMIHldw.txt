This little shop has all the makings of a great restaurant, except good service and quality food.  I've been there twice, the food on the first trip was good, if a little simple (I believe anyone can wrap a piece of fish in bacon and cook the hell out of it).  On the second trip both my girlfriend and I  ended up with bland food, my side dish of rice was undercooked and her meal had zero flavor.  Our waiter was too busy falling all over some yuppy girls at the next table to bother with us.  We're generally not picky, but after we brought the problems with the meal to the attention of our waiter, he literally shrugged, apologized and went back to flirting with the next table.  No offer to correct anything.  We won't be back anytime soon.

Overall the place is great for people to see and be seen, it's a yuppy hangout, it's loud and the food is hit or miss.  Pretty much sums up NODA these days.
