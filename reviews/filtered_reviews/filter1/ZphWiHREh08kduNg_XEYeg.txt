Overpriced, mostly just rice and beans. Salsa was watered down. My first time at this location and it will be my last. Bussers run there ass off and servers seem to do nothing. Took forever for are food to get there and when it did it was cold. When I complained to the manager he barely spoke English. Anyways if you looking for great Mexican food look elsewhere.
