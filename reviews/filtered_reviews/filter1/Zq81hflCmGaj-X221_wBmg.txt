It's hard to use so many great ingredients and still have the food come out bland but the Donkey pulls it off.   Perhaps there is some special process that bleeds the flavor from Hatch Green Chilis that only the Donky know about.

The tort of  enchiladas was thicker than the quilt grandma made me up In Minnesota.  The beans were tasty, all 2 ounces of them....     

The bar waitress was so unattentive I had to call the restaurant on my cell and ask for a watiress to be sent to my table.   Gotta love those empty headed Scottsdale bimbos.

All in all I would say it is a great restaurnant for Scottsdale gringos who have no idea what real southwestern food tastes like, and don't care or about freindly service so long as the building is fancy and they can tell their friends they went to the latest trendy spot.

This one will be GONE in a year.
