12/28/11 DINNER.

One of the single worst meals I've had in my entire life on this planet.

Went with spouse.

We started off with each of us ordering a $15 "large ultimate margarita". They ask you to call your tequila, I said "Herradura", but to tell you the truth, there is so much mixer in the drink, why bother? They might as well simply offer them with the cheapest booze in the well and charge you less for them. By the end of the drink, and dinner, I felt little to no buzz from a very large glass of cocktail.

Spouse ordered a 3-item combo with a salad to start. The combo, one tamale, one taco, one chile relleno, was $16. The added salad was $3. $19 total. Ridiculous.

I ordered the "enchilada de Cangrejo", AKA their "New Mexican" crab enchiladas. That single plate of food, 2 rolled tortillas with god-knows-where-it-came-from crab (Lake Las Vegas?), rice (which I didn't eat, cuz it was one of the worst versions I've ever tried) and beans (that tasted burnt, so I didn't eat them either) was $17. $17? Again, ridiculous.

So ALL I ate were some chips, some salsa (which was sad), some bean dip (which was acceptable), two SUPPOSEDLY New-Mexican sauced (there was no heat or flavor) rolls of crab and cheese. That's it, for (with tax/tip) $35 for my portion of the meal.

Now, I eat everything. I am not a snob nor "food challenged", I love most food put in front of me. And I NEVER get ill from food, unless food poisoning (maybe 6 times in 55 years?) is involved.

Well, I was sick with indigestion for nearly 24 hours after this meal.

Yet ANOTHER strike-out for Mexican food in Las Vegas Valley. And this was a MAJOR fail.
