I'm not really quite sure why this place is considered mexican.  It's more of an American restaurant.  But they do offer a lot of specials and their frozen margarita drinks are tasty.  However their food doesn't really impress me.  It's more of a dive bar to go sit and throw back a few drinks rather than a restaurant to come and dine at.
