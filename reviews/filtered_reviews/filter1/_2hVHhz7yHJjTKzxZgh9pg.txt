I ate here last spring and ordered the chicken fajitas. I was served rubbery chicken that seemed to been cooked in pure salty soy sauce. My dad ordered the steak fajitas...again with the soy sauce. I was with some vegetarians (I don't remember what they ordered) but they were pretty meh about their food as well. For the 9-10$ the fajitas cost, I was expecting a little more than soy sauce seasoning.

The actual place is pretty cute and they have various rooms that are decorated well. The service was ok. The chips and salsa were the best thing about the meal. I would not eat here again.
