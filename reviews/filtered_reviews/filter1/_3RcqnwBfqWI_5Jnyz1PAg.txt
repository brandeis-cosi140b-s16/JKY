Wow just had one of the worst service experiences. Walked in today at 6:45 1/3/14 and immediately knew I should have turned around. There were two women working the front- both glared at us and made me extremely uncomfortable from the beginning. The one lady was standing near the cash wrap and literally glared and looked me up and down several times before ordering. The lady taking my order was worse- had a smirk on her face the entire time and the worst attitude. Got our food to go- doesn't stop there. I ordered 3 enchiladas that hardly had any sauce on them- very dry and smothered in sour cream. Not at all like the experience I had before but I will never return to this location and highly recommend you think twice. There are much better Mexican joints that treat you with respect. Awful experience!!!
