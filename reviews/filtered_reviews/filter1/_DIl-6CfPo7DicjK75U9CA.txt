By far one of the worst experiences I've had at a bar in Arizona. 

Walked in on a Friday night and sat at the bar since we were only looking for drinks. Upon waiting 10 minutes for a bartender to notice us (not even that busy), my friend and I took notice how the entire staff looked miserable. Not a single smile, laugh, or friendly acknowledgment to coworkers or patrons, instead everyone looked incredibly unapproachable.  After now waiting 15 minutes, an alcohol distributor came by and offered us free drinks - which we graciously accepted. It was once this lady had left that a bartender finally noticed us and seemed very upset with serving us only water at that point. First round of drinks were great- and we decided to have another round. Again, it took 20 minutes for a bartender to even acknowledge us even with two drinks sitting empty in front of us. All the while, two other ladies stopped by and asked us why is it so hard to get a drink, at which I answered we've been waiting for forever, and they intelligently decided to leave. We asked for the same drink as received prior a Sol-Rita and this time a Champagne-Rita. Both of these drinks this time tasted awful - no consistency with the same Sol-Rita as prior. Even more so, no salt was added to the drinks! After sitting for 10 minutes and not even drinking the Champagne-rita, a different bartender asked if we were ok. I then informed him that the one drink particularly was not good and before I could even finish my sentence, he grabbed the drink and threw it away and proceeded to make a new one. Not once was there any sort of acknowledgment to show sorry for the situation. 

Avoid at all costs, there are so many other places in Tempe Market Place that have friendly staff and better prices!
