Service was very slow. Took 10 min to see a hostess to get seated,  20 minutes for drinks and over an hour for dinner. We ordered street tacos, so I could not figure out the delay. When the not so helpful manager came over to check on us, the response was " we do not claim to be a fast food restaurant." Rude and unnecessary! He apologized for the slow service, stating they were so busy, however the restaurant was not close to full for a Friday night.  The food was fairly good, but I have had much faster and tastier tacos from a food truck. However, one point to drill in was that the food was pretty pricey for the quality. With so many other great restaurants in the Scottsdale area I can say we will NEVER return (that was the conclusion of my party of four and our friends we happened to run into there that night.)
