We were so hopeful of this place but then so disappointed!  

We live in the neighborhood so we thought we'd try it for take out.  Heard the burgers were better than the tacos so we went for them.  We love the Phoenix burger battle scene - but these burgers were the worst I've tried in the Phoenix metro area!  I have to say we never got a fair shot because we asked for the special sauce on the side.  They did provide sauce on the side but also slopped it all over our burgers!  I could not taste the meat and my bun was super soggy - yuck!  We were also hopeful for the fries but they were so-so.  

Bad experience, might have just hit it on a bad night / service.  Willing to give it another shot...sometime but I think we'll stick to our favorites for now!
