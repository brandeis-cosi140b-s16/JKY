First of all the salsa dip trays are a total joke. They are baby size. Hardly any room for salsa. To add to that, the chips are super thin and lack salt & flavor. Okay so I was looking at the menu and I decided to order a classic chimichanga Mexican dish. It looked good because generally the pictures are to display the quality of the food. I was totally wrong! When I received my chimichanga it was so small! I asked for beef which usually comes shredded, but it came out in chunk sizes and it tasted smoked and uncooked. Lastly, they used nacho cheese instead of regular sprinkled cheese to go along with the beef. Very disappointed in such a fancy looking place :(
