What happened to this place?!  This has been one of our favorite restaurants for quite a while but due to our last visit it has been removed from our list of eateries.  We popped in on a Saturday evening around 5pm.  We were seated right away and asked for 2 waters.  Our waitress took our order, 2 vegetarian burritos, one without cheese.  They arrived 2 minutes later.  That seals their fate for me.  That is a blinking sign that it is a conveyor belt restaurant.  No accommodation for quality, just slap the pre-cooked ingredients together and get the food out so the customer can scarf it down so we can clear the table and seat it again.  Don't worry about offering a nice atmosphere or enjoyable meal.  We asked the waitress for some salsa or red sauce to put on top of our burritos and she replied by glaring at us and saying what do you want - the salsa or red sauce.  For some reason it took way longer to get the red sauce then the actual entrees but when it did arrive it was accompanied by the bill.  Again, scarf the food, clear the table.

I had to request a refill on my water, sorry for putting her out with that request.  The bill reflected a $4 charge for the red sauce, nice!   I try to recognize the good even when it is overshadowed by the disappointing so I will say that the restrooms were clean.
