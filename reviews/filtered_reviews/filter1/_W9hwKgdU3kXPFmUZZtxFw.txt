Pronounced: "Me-Choke-On".  Stomach ache after eating here.  When this restaurant used to be located in a much smaller venue, it once had authentic, delicious, purposeful meals.  Now that they've moved to this larger location with no doubt, a great view, I'm not sure what happened.  Hopefully they go back to their good food roots.  Otherwise, maybe better off enjoying the view from the outside.
