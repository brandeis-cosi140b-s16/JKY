The green pozole was really good. Happy to see an authentic Mexican soup recipe anywhere, let alone an airport restaurant. Yum. Pozole gets 5 stars. However......This one star was for the service and the guacamole.

My fianc√© and I happen to have noticed that we were sitting next to a semi-famous rock musician at lunch (yes, here at the airport). No big deal to us, really, but our server became VERY star-struck when he noticed and was so giddy and distracted. He lingered at the rock star table, and was trying to engage him in conversation constantly. It was really annoying and our service suffered big time. 

The guacamole on the menu stated it was made table side by your server, which is always awesome, so we ordered it. Needless to say we were VERY surprised when our shameless server boy quickly dropped off a small bowl of Pre-made guacamole instead of fresh guacamole made table side. Ohhhhhh K.......It's also covered in pomegranate seeds. Not exactly easy to eat as the seeds are not meant for consumption (just the red juicy part around them). It was straight up sour! Soaked in lime juice, and absolutely salty. Disappointing and gross. 

I think a restaurant that advertises expensive table side guacamole should actually MAKE table side guacamole. That way there's no chance of F'ing it up with too much lime or funky pomegranate seeds. I also think focused, attentive waitstaff is a must. Barrio cafe just doesn't cut it. Get a better overpriced meal further inside the airport terminal.
