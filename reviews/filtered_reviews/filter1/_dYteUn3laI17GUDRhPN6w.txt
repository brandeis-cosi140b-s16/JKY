This staff is the rudest bunch of people to work in a restaurant. They make you feel like they want you to leave as soon as you sit down, and ordering anything was the biggest imposition on our waitress. I could almost hear her sigh heavily when we asked for water and when she brought a pitcher the cups were floating on the water inside the pitcher. I dont want her fired, I want her to quit because she clearly hates working there.
