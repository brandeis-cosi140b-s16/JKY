The 1 Star was for the Mahi tacos that was the only thing that was great about this experience. Being from San Diego I am spoiled when it comes to great Mexican food and service. First off when you order a shot Put it in a small rocks glass not a plastic cup that you make jello shooters in! Serve real salsa and guacamole Please for goodness sake! If your going to call yourself a Mexican establishment then do it right! Please hire a waitress that has a brain and isn't slow! If it wasn't for the fact it was a go away party I would have never stepped foot in a such a dirty establishment.  WORST MANGO AND STRAWBERRY MARGARITAS EVER!!
