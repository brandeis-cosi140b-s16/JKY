Last year I came to this place with coworkers and the food was not as everyone talked about.   All this craze that is was some really good authentic Mexican food.  Not true at all, all of the food is drenched in yellow cheese. You know if the service was great you sometimes over see a few things on the food but when food sucks and service sucks also then you have nothing to gain from coming to this place.  We came again this year (last week) and still the same shity service and wow the food!!!!!!! The food was gross. .... I asked for Chile Verde, hold on I asked the guy. Hey which one is better the green or red he said green. Should not of done that, food was nasty. One good thing was the beans... beans were good. Will not go again.
