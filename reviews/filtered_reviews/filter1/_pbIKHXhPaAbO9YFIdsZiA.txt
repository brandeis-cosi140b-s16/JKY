My boyfriend and I have always been fans of Arriba but they drove us away as customers. We hadn't been back for a few months because of how bad our service had been but the food and drink was usually worth it. Let me tell you that is now sub-par as well, aside from the Margarita that was for 2 and fairly priced, the waitress didn't card us and proceeded to call us Kid's/Kiddo's the remainder of our visit. I work in the restaurant industry and would NEVER serve Kid's or Kiddo's a Margarita for two. Also no waters were given to us until requested. I ordered the Carne Asada and it came out looking good, until I started actually eating it, the carne was piled on top of a HUGE slab of red cabbage, gross. The waitress asked my boyfriend if he wanted Guacamole and Sour Cream making it sound like it was included in his meal so he said sure, the bill came and $1.99 for sour cream, and $2.50 for guacamole.... Holy hell they don't even give you more than 3 tablespoons of the stuff. Concern for the customers wallet is not there and we just had her pay for it with her tip, I don't think I've ever done that to anyone before. I do not recommend this place to ANYONE, unless you're just going for drinks and some chips and salsa other than that avoid this place entirely if you enjoy good service, friendly atmosphere, and good food.
