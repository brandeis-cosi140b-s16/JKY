I went to this place on Wednesday and it was packed I thought the food was gonna be good well... I was soooo wrong I ordered a "quesadilla" with meat it was a soft tortilla (the size of my hand) with cheese and meat and on top of the meat they put a burned tostada I have never seen a quesadilla prepared like that and it didn't even taste good it had no flavor. My cousin ordered some tacos and the tortillas were  stuck to the paper they put them in  Worst place I have ever been to.
