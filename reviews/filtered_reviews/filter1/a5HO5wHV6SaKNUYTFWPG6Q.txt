We ordered cheese dip as soon as we sat down. By time it arrived we still hadn't seen our server, had to ask bus person for water. We were almost finished with cheese dip when our server finally arrived. We probably
waited 10 minutes for someone to greet us, when he did he seemed rushed, I think he was in a different part of the restaurant. When we ordered drinks he had a tough time understanding the wine I wanted  "Chardonnay" so I pointed to menu. I told him we had a groupon upfront incase they wanted to see it first as some places do. I knew the Fajitas #24 were enough for two so I told him we were going to split it. He proceeds to tell us NO you can't do that you have to have two entrees!! (Yes I knew we had to spend $37.50 to use the groupon). Ok we will order another dish. BF ordered Cam Mojo de Ajo, shrimp cooked in garlic. Food arrived quickly. Our drinks are almost gone by now. 
My Fajitas had absolutely no flavor what-so-ever, the chicken was very dry. Very disappointed as my girlfriend had them before and they were delish! The #24 shrimp dish was served with shells and legs still on. The garlic seemed like the jarred type, not fresh. Plus normally saut√©ed shrimp isn't cooked with shells on. It was overpowering with garlic. Drinks empty now. Stick with water. We saw our waiter 3 far and between times. When he gave us check it put it on the table and left. After waiting to pay him, we took it to the front. Would have been nice had he told us! 
Not going back.
