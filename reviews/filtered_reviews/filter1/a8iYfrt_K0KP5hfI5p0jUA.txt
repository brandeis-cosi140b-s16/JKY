Awful. We had a large party of 18 and when we got there promptly for our reservation out table was not ready.  We were led to our table and only a portion of us could sit down.  The rest of the group stood in the middle of the restaurant while we waited for a smaller table to clear and pay their tab.  The salsa was tasteless, the salmon was gross and the ribs were worse.  Not a fan!!!
