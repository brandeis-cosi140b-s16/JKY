Horrible service, very unorganized, and overpriced. They're unable to answer questions about how many ounces of meat you get per serving and they nickel and dime you for everything when you make your own bowl. I asked for brown rice with my bowl and received white instead. They need to hire more competent people to work here. Definitely not coming back.
