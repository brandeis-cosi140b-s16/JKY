I was in town for a convention and decided to stop in for dinner. I had been here before for drinks when I was 21, and it was a good time then, its a big difference I guess when you go in and actually sit down for dinner opposed to hanging around drinking. I came in and sat down at the upstairs bar, there were 3 female bartenders working, one was taking to what I thought was a customer but turned out to be an employee waiting for their shift to start, and the two other girls one was training the other but were completely ignoring me as they were talking about girl stuff to each other. After I sat patiently for about 5-10 minutes I finally spoke up and asked for a food menu. I had planned on ordering a bowl of tortilla soup and a platter of steak tacos. I had made my decision pretty quickly and again I was waiting for another 10 minutes for someone to come back and take my order (not to mention this was around 6pm, and the place was pretty empty.) By the time someone came to take my order I was so annoyed and just ordered the tortilla soup and a corona. I looked at my watch to see what time I had ordered my soup, it had taken 25 minutes for them to bring out the soup which was mediocre at best, I had finished my beer well before they even brought out the soup and had the empty bottle sitting in front of me with no one asking if I wanted another. Needless to say I finished my soup and left. The service was absolutely awful and soup was average, I would never come back here again and do not recommend this place. Vegas is all about the service industry, there are a million other places on the strip striving for business.
