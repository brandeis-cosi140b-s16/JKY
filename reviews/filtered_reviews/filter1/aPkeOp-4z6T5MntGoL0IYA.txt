Roberto's is the best Mexican you can get in Anthem, but when it's competing with only Taco Bell and a mediocre sit-down restaurant, it's not much of a complement.  
The food serves as a decent way to satisfy your Mexican craving, but the business itself is run very poorly. My family and I used to regularly visit this place, but we wont' be anymore.
Numerous times our orders were wrong. Sometimes I'm tempted just to give them money and say "Surprise me" because that's what ends up happening anyways.
If you call to order, many times you won't get anyone answering. Their voicemail isn't even set up.
Just this past weekend, we wanted to grab some tacos on the way home. After calling three times and getting no answer, we stopped by and it was closed. It should have been open according to their posted hours, but instead they just had a piece of paper up that said they would be open the next day. Again, no voicemail was set up or anything to check and see. 
The owners seem like nice people and the food is decent enough, but it's lacking professionalism and making customers feel undervalued. We won't be eating at Roberto's anymore.
