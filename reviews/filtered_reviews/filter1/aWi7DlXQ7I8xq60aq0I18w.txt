the best part of this meal was the salsa and chips.  Service sucked we waited a good ten minutes before anyone came to our table after being seated, and it wasn't busy. Guacamole was missing something just didn't taste like guac- it was missing something, but not sure what.  My salad was not very good, The veggies were cut to thick, and obviously cut way earlier in the day as they were starting to wilt. Any of the seeds that the wrote about on the menu were obviously plated first as they weren't seen until the end. Chicken was suppose to be spicy- it was bland although cooked decently.  The fish taco that my wife had was disappointing and lack luster.  It was very uninspired, the blackened mahi mahi was well not blacked the cheese was just kinda there the only redeeming part of it was a white cilantro sauce.   Overall food would be a 2 but service is a 1.  that combo wont be bring me back.
