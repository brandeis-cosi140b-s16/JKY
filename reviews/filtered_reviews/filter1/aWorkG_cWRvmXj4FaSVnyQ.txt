I think this place is overrated and "cool" just because people say it is (and because, yeah, it is a funny name)

It's incredibly overpriced-- $9 for a damn burrito-- with no chips, no guac, no sour cream, NO CHEESE-- all those cost extra?

plus, handful of times i've been here (because my friends insisted they liked it... until i brought them to reality), they salsa containers have been empty, and stayed empty even after I notified the staff. By they time they refilled them, everyone else in my group had eaten so I felt I needed to eat anyway, even without the salsa (which i desperately needed because bland meat, rice, and beans in a plain tortilla wrap just isn't that yummy)

the food is seriously bland unless you get all sorts of add-ons, which is unreasonable because it costs so dang much to begin with!
