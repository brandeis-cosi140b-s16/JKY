Ever walked into an old establishment and feel like you leave needing  shower...welcome to Dona Maria. It's plain damp feeling and just unpleasant. The food was OK but being  regular lunch eater in the downtown area I'm glad I waited so long to try this place and it will be a long time before I try it again. Sorry!!!
