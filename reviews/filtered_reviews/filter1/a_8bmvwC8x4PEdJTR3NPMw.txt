This place has just gone down hill, we keep going back in hopes the "traditional Macayos" is back.... No such luck. Drinks took 20min, fish taco was burnt and came out 10min after the rest of the meals. Lots of items forgotten on the dishes we ordered. The manager didn't seem to be concerned at all. The food is just not good. I would suggest Rio Mirage if your looking for good Mexican food in Surprise.
