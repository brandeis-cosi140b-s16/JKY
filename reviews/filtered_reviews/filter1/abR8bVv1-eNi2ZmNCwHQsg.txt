Ok. I'll be the first to say that the food is good and in the Summer, it's nice, dark and cool inside. However, here is what the 1star rating is about. 
I have eaten in there and ordered food to go a number of times!! I'm done. 
They (Rokrij, Dick's Hideaway and Richardson's) are a Phoenix institution and they know it. The staff really couldn't care less that you are there because they feel entitled to business. They give off the attitude that THEY are doing YOU a favor!
The final straw was that a person in our party really didn't like their meal and asked nicely for a replacement. (The description on the menu wasn't enough and granted, she could have asked questions, but the waiter/'bartender' wasn't attentive, and would have been annoyed.) SO at ANY OTHER ESTABLISHMENT they would have taken the meal and gladly replaced it. Not Dick's! (Aptly named!) They groaned, made a new dish and charged her for BOTH!!! 
Also, I had ordered a cocktail off of THEIR cocktail menu. The waiter/'bartender' had no idea how to make it and just winged it! 11.00 or so for a 1st try, reading ingredients off the menu cocktail?! Not exceptable. 
Please see my review of Richardson's for yet another crazy example of their entitlement mentality! In a city of literally thousands of good restaurants, and more opening every week; why would you subject yourself to this?
