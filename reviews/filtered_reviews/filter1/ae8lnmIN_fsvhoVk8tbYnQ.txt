One of the worst things to do is to not greet a table after they've been seated. Being a waitress myself at a few restaurants in the past, I know that once a table is sat you are suppose to greet them within 30 seconds of them being seated and no longer than one minute. That said, I went to gallo blanco with my husband and we we're seated right when we got there. The place didn't seem busy at all and there were a lot of employees walking around. We were sitting in the middle of the restaurant for about 10 minutes with just our menus. No water was brought to our table, we were never officially greeted by anyone, and we were ignored by all. Needless to say we simply got up and left because we were hungry and wanted to actually eat. I'm sure that they didn't even notice. It's a shame really because we've ordered take out before and their food was great but service was terrible.
