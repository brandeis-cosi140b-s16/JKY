One of the worst Happy Hours in Vegas...or anywhere for that matter! We were tempted by this HH because it starts at 2:00pm and we had some time to kill waiting for friends to arrive in town. The bartender was pleasant enough. The $5 drink menu is very limited...sangria, shots of Jose, beer, well drinks (What Mexican restaurant HH does not include a HH margarita??? Apparently only this one...LAME!) The $5 food menu is also pretty limited. While we were deciding what to order we munched on some chips and salsa. We ordered the hot wings, nachos and two rum and cokes, because I don't do shots of Jose and THERE WAS NO HH MARGARITA...super lame. The drinks were small but the chips and salsa are really good. Here is the lowdown on the food:

Hot Wings $5 - 3 sad little breaded wings. They looked and tasted like standard frozen industrial wings from Costco. Did I mention there were only 3 wings...for $5??? WTF?

Nachos $5 - Ugh..how can you ruin nachos? A very small bowl of chips, covered in a tasteless black bean paste (I will let you use your imagination about what this dark, black paste looked like) and an orange substance that tasted like cheese in a can. The topping was sparse and only covered the top layer of chips, which I guess is a good thing because it was vile. I have honestly had better nachos from AM/PM. These were borderline disgusting and after two chips I had to stop eating them.

This happy hour failed to make me happy, and actually made me a little sad and angry. HH FAIL!!!

AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!
