I am not quite sure how people manage to call this Mexican food. I ordered the enchiladas de pollo and I was absolutely disgusted. There was so much queso on top of my enchiladas that it made it extremely hard to eat. I might as well have just ordered queso as my main entree. The side of rice that was given to me looked and tasted like fried rice from a local Chinese restaurant. 

My service was outstanding and that is probably the only thing that was great about my dining experience. I definitely will not be returning. If I want some Mexican food, I will head to Central Ave. for some authentic food.
