I don't know how this place has ever received more than 1 star. I had veggie tacos, which were pickled beets and onions, and they were TERRIBLE. And why are they giving us lentils?? They are flavorless and mealy. And the rice, good lord, was literally inedible. It was dry and hard and none of us could manage to scoop any rice onto our forks because it was dried up and hardened into a "rice patty" of sorts. The guacamole was delicious, but everything else was awful. Tacos are my favorite food, and I'm not picky, I love 99% of the tacos I've ever had, but I have to say, skip Taco Haus.
