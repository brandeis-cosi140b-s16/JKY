Had a bad experience... Found a chicken bone in my burrito, food took 45 minutes to come out, never saw our server, and it wasn't busy at all. There was no excuse for the terrible service and wait times, let alone the bone that I almost broke a tooth on. 

The atmosphere is kind of cool, but they could care less about you and it shows. We finally asked to speak with the manager (I have never done that before in my life), and she quasi apologized and informed us that she would discount our bill- When the bill arrived she deducted a whopping $4! That was less than the burrito cost with the chicken bone. This place must be kind of good because of all the positive reviews, but I would NEVER recommend going to this place.
