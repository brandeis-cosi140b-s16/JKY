We were excited to find a place the served menudo AND posole.  The menu looked excellent and the aromas were wonderful.  The place was clean.  Chips and salsa were supposed to come with the meal but no, we didn't get that.  We asked for oregano, but never got that either.  When we asked again, they said someone will come by to our table.  No one ever did although two tables next two us were visited by waitstaff three times but never stopped once at ours.  The broth for both the menudo and posole were thin and lacked flavor.  We asked for a chile relleno on the side, but never received that.  Anyway, we were hungry, finished half and left.  Will not be back.
