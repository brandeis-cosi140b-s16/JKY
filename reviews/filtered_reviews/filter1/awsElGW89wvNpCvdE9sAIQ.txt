The bartender was going off on the ladies next to us who returned a dish because it had no turkey in it.

When returned to the kitchen the 3 Mexican  guys in the kitchen were totally talking BS about the customers. In Spanish.

Unprofessional and bad. This place is seriously lacking management and the staff all seemed miserable.
