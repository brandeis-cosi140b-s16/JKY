Keep driving on past this place , what a wreck in service .  NO Practical solution to the madness behind the counter , the cooks behind the counter are so flustered that they can't keep up with one single ticket at one time !   Orders are late , took 15 minutes just to get a burger , and after asking for the rest of our order , the confusion began !  It was a burger AND fries ! Served one at a time in 20 minute intervals !  Not a good impression for a burger that I could of probably bought down the street at circle K !  Good luck in the future , how ever long it last at THE STRANDED burger !
