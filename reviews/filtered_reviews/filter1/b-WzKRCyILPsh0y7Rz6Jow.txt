Very disappointed in the food and service we received over the weekend.  I bragged about this restaurant and decided to bring my friends here to celebrate my friends birthday and what a huge disappointment.  I'm a huge fan of Javier's in Newport Beach and expected the same in Las Vegas.  Well boy was I wrong.  Service was slow, terrible and food was mediocre.  Our server was basically non existent.  Food came out and hour later, just as we were about to pay for our drinks and leave.  Our server never checked on us, or asked if we needed anything.  When heading out I made a comment to our busser about the crapy service and even he chimed in and said "Yeah, he sucks as a server".  I couldn't help but laugh.  What a joke, will never come back.  Save your money.
