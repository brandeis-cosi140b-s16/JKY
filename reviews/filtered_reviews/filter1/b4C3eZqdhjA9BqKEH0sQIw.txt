Nope. Grew up in San Antonio, so I have some tertiary knowledge when it comes to Mexican food. Met Irving. Nice enough guy. Was on a date and she was happy with what she ordered - standard enchilada fare. I had steak - Carne Tampiquena. This, my friends, was a sirloin that could compete in the Ironman Triathlon. It had EXTRAORDINARY straying power, much like the leather on my 15 year old Doc Martens. Couldn't do it. Even ordered it on the rare side of medium rare so that it couldn't be over flame thrown.  

As we were getting ready to go, our check was grossly out of whack, price-wise. Here's why... As we were waiting to order, Irving asked us if we would like some guacamole to go with our chips. Sure, I said. We ordered a bowl, which was small, perhaps 6 oz. That bowl ran $13 on the check. Notice that it isn't on the menu.

Never again. Ever. EVER.
