If i could give zero stars I would. I was beyond disappointed. I was excited because how close it is to our home and all of the great reviews on here about how authentic, fresh, and delicious the food is. And it awful. Hubby got carnitas tacos, I got chicken fajitas,our son got chicken fingers and grandma got the carnitas platter. First the salsa and chips they serve you as you wait.. The salsa had very little flavor. The chicken on my fajitas was overcooked, dry, unseasoned and just awful.. The Spanish rice was bland probably just bouillon cube boiled in the rice. The guac wasn't anything special but it might've been the best thjng there along with the chicken fingers. The carnitas was DRY!! Unfortunately will not be going back
