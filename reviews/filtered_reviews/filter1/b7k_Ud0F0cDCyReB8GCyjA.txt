In our recent trip to Vegas, we decided to eat at La Salsa -thinking it was as good as the other La Salsa chain restaurants we've been to in California. Nope, we were WRONG.  The cheapest burrito on the menu was about $14 and it had some nasty-ass instant "uncle Ben's flavored" rice that was as hard as a rock.  They had no veggie tacos as they do in all the other La Salsa's I've been to and you have to pay for chips and salsa. WTF! Please don't make the same mistake we did, thinking we could have a quick decent burrito. I would recommend going to the Del Taco next door, upstairs in the food court where their burritos are $1.49 and if you don't like their burritos at least you only invested a fraction of the cost.  What a shame that La Salsa can't even keep their quality standards uniform throughout their chains.  On the bright side, if you're drunk and won't remember or care what you're eating, this place will work -but so will eating out of the garbage.
