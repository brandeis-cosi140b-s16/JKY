The tacos were too big my advice keep them small and don't do double tortilla we get it you guys want us to leave satisfied but are doing a mistake serving your tacos with two huge tortillas.! We will not be going there anymore want so good tacos 7 ave and camelback next yo Charlie's "tacos Yakis" delicious tacos and not as pricy! Oh and why do you serve tacos with beans and rice wtf that's too American! Good night people.!
