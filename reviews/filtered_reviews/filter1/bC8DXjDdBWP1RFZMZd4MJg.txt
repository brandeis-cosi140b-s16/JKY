Very overpriced BLAND food! My wife & I shared the fish tacos that cost $14. Sure you get 3 tacos but the tortillas a tiny maybe 3 inches in diameter. And you would expect the deep fried Tilapia to be nice and crunchy but it was soggy. The size the Tilapia was smaller than the size of a average fish stick. The Mexican rice had no flavor at all, no seasoning. just colored rice. The black beans were ok but nothing to brag about. Overall this was a very poor meal, and we will not go back. Very Small Portions & Under Seasoned food for $14 (and this was a cheaper priced item).  I have had better fish tacos at a fast food restaurant that cost $6
