If I could give them a zero stars I would.  Diablo's Cantina at the Monte Carlo has the worst service.  I actually have been there twice and both times the service was bad.  I had forgotten how bad it was, though.  The second time was worse and I will never go back there.  There are several servers yet they never seem to be anywhere to be found.  It took forever for them to come take the order and you pretty much had to get out of your seat and search them out or find a busboy or someone else to try to find your waiter to get any additional help.  It was such a pain to get more water, or more chips, or your paycheck, and if there was something wrong with your food it was easier to just eat it then get it fixed or get something else.  My friend's food was less then desirable, but she ate it anyway because it was a lost cause to do anything about it.  I saw some of the waiters in the corner just talking to each other, hanging out, not giving a care about their responsibilities.  Then when we left we saw a group of waiters out in the back smoking and we finally figured out were all the waiters seem to disappear, they were having a party out back.  Talk about needing new management.
