Sorry family but.....Nando's is Nada!   An extreme exercise of the gluttonous Gilbert Arizona restaurant fest.  Same typical timeline: after fighting for a spot in an overfilled parking lot, push through the huge crowd standing (hardly enough seats) in the hot lobby to hear that it will take 30-40 minutes to be seated (after it takes them 5 minutes to figure that out), then try to stay awake while sitting among people staring at the wall and kids running around.  Finally get seated and given cavernous Diet Cokes (standard) and chips (which you eat the whole bottomless basket of since you are waiting so long).   The waitress looks busy as hell and takes another 30 minutes to take our order, meanwhile I drink 4 diet cokes.  Already having comsumed enough calories for 2 people, the main meal arrives:  my "fish tacos" are 6 mini strips of tough fish laid in less-than-fresh tortillas, with 80% of the rest of the plates filled with cheese, beans, and rice.  I have had better Mexican at hole-in-the wall joints at 3am.   This time we ordered the fried ice cream for dessert, one order of which was big enough to feed the entire table.   As the night went on I glanced around and noticed that the average BMI in the place was around 32.   I would be the same if I did this place even once a week.....
