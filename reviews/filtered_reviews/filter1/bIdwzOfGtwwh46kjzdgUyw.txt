This is a cry for help. I feel like this place is destined to be a place on restaurant impossible. From the start there were issues. We waited at the front to be seated for several minutes while there were only a couple tables filled. I think there were only 2 servers working which was clearly understaffed but also seemed like its probably normal. 
The food was bad. As in, my chile relleno tasted ROTTEN. It was filled with some gross greasy cheese mess and had doubly greasy batter that it was fried in. I honestly wouldn't have fed this to a pig.
I probably have more to say but I feel that any more effort is unnecessary and would be a lost cause.
