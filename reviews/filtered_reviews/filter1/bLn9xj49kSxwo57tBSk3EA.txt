I've been coming to El Bravo for a number of years now and have always been satisfied with the food, prices and service.  A friend and I went yesterday and were not happy.  The machaka burro was on the dry side.  The waiter(new) didn't have a clue.  Usually chips are brought on contact.  Not this time.  He asked us if we wanted chips which I found odd.  We got our food and drinks soon enough but the waiter never came back to inquire about another drink.   Finally he came with the bill which was a shock  The chips, sauce on the burros, rice, beans all were extra.  Then the bill charged one of the burros twice for the green sauce.  When I brought it up, it didn't seem like the waiter and the other gentleman waiter had a clue.  New ownership???
