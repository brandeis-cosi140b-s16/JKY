The fajitas were 5 star...so why just a 1 star rating?

1. Location...it is technically on the strip but it is the nasty part between the Stratosphere and the Sahara.

2.The service...it sucked in a major way. The only clients that were getting proper attention were the 2 business men seated next to us. Otherwise the waitresses are lazy at their job.

3.The food...other than my fajitas, EVERYTHING ELSE was Taco Bell grade at best. Very cold food. The "famous" tamales were just gross. Dry old masa with gummy slightly slimy texture meat...old frozen and microwaved I imagine. Yuck.

4. The silverware looked to be dirty. Good thing I had tortillas to use.
