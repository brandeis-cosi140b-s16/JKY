Literally the worst Mexican food I have ever tasted in my life ( until I went to Macayos!!!)  So now its the second worst Mexican food I have ever had.  We had an appetizer that was overcooked or over deep fried little tasteless burritos that were supposed to come with a bean dip that didnt come til we were done with the appetizer.  When we asked for the missing bean dip our waiter got a bit defensive about it.  It was so bland and tasteless anyway and we didnt eat it. We had a chili relleno that was just awful.  It was swimming in oil, a thick slick of oil.  Very weird feeling in your mouth.  I almost vomited literally but instead I spit it out in my napkin.  I had a combo burrito and taco and the taco was in the deep fryer so long that the edges of the meat were black and the cheese they stuffed inside never melted so it was a weird combo taste texture.  The burrito was about the best thing but still the worst I have ever had.  There were lots of tiny pieces of what appeared to be red peppers and green peppers as well as onions in the meat mixture but it seemed to be old as if it had been in fridge or left over a couple days.   Someone else said that the beans were like play dough and yes thats a good description! The chips and salsa also not that good.  Salsa wasnt the worst but not that good and was definitely not fresh or made by them and the chips were so brown they were almost burnt.  The waiter was a bad mood jerk.

The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful with the lake and the fountain all lit up at night.  Gordon Ramsey really needs to make a visit to this place.  I cant believe they are in business since 83 and that people recommend this place.  What are they thinking????
