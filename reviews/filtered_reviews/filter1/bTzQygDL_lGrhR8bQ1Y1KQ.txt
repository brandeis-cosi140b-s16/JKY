We went there on a Tuesday night in Jan. 2010. The weather was nice (of course) so we decided to sit outside. There were maybe 20 people or so on the patio overlooking the strip. There were no seats looking out on the strip so we sat down at a table and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. One waitress walked by and glared at us, giving me a look like "what the fuck are you doing here and why are you making my life miserable?" So we waited a few more minutes and left. 

What I observed while waiting was that the ritas are served in plastic cups, which tells me that they are not going to be good. And the food looked very mediocre. I doubt that Sammy would be happy. But then again, everything is so over-priced he probably is raking in the dough.
