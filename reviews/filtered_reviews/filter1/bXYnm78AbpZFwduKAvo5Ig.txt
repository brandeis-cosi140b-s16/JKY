See my review of Dick's Hideaway for more details on this company's self righteous attitude. 

So, I was planning a birthday dinner party. If you've ever been to Richardson's patio and sat at the big table outside on a beautiful AZ evening or day, you know why I thought it would be nice to have the party there. 

Well, I called 40days ahead of time to try and reserve the space. They will not speak with you about it on the phone and instruct you to email them with your request. So, I did. 25 days later, I'd not heard back from them so I called. I was told to email again. I did. Then 10days before my event,  I emailed again stating that I was very dissappointed that they hadn't replied and that I guess I'll find another venue. So I did. After all, if you're expecting to get a party of 15 at a nice table on a Saturday night during high season, you'd better plan ahead! 

Literally, LITERALLY, the day before on Friday afternoon, they called me to see if I still wanted the table. LOL! Really!!?? As if I would have thought for one minute that that would come through and I'd be able to tell 15 guests on Friday night, where to be on Saturday night! 

Clueless. Entitled. They have lost ALL perspective.
