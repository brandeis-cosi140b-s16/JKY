Went on a Wednesday evening with 7 people (hours after a spring training game).  Waited approx 20 minutes before 2 of us went to the bar ourselves and got our drinks.  Mentioned to the bartender we had no service and he just laughed.  We had to wait another 20+ minutes and then I found a server, Mackenzie, who said she would find someone to help us, but still no one came AGAIN/STILL!!!  We were going to leave, but I decided to call the restaurant from our table and asked to speak with the manager, Charles.  When I saw who the manager was, I got him to come to our table and told him what was going on.  He said he would "take care of us" and found us a server, Mackenzie, even though that was not her area to serve.  She gave us good service and Charles also checked with us a few more times to ask how we were doing.  We received our food in good time (shocker), but when we asked for silverware, the gal who brought our food (not Mackenzie), could only find 3 sets.  REALLY????  We asked if they ran out and she said no, but she just couldn't find any.   Meal was good (which is what we heard and the only reason why we stayed), but when it came time to pay and we asked for the check, we were "taken care of" by being comped 1 beer (the cheap one) of $3.00!!!!!  We left a very generous 20% tip and I asked Mackenzie if that was really all they were going to comp us with what we just went through.  She said that it was the $3.00 beer and I said I wanted to talk with Charles, but she said he had left because they ran out of coffee!!!  

This place has TERRIBLE SERVICE and even though the food was decent and even though I found the manager, Charles, for some assistance, it's just not worth it to go here for the aggravation.

I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone unless you have lots of time.  And I am surprised the M's could broadcast from here to promote this place.  If I could find a way to let the M's organization know how terrible this place/customer service is, I would.
