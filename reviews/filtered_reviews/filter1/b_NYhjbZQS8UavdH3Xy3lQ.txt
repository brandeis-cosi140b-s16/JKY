The service was acceptable. Refills were a little slow, but I can deal with that. The food was not good. When nachos are supposed to come with cheese and cheese sauce I should notice the cheese. There was very little cheese and none of the sauce. On top of that my nachos came with a surprise heap of black beans. I've never had black beans with Mexican food so this was a surprise, and unfortunately I do not like black beans. My daughter ordered the mac n cheese off of the kids menu. The bowl was not large, and was about a third full. I had to feed her again when we got home. It was probably about 5 ounces of mac n cheese, literally. I tried the nachos that my wife ordered, they were okay but also lacked cheese. I was hoping that this would be what I hoped for, but it isn't. We likely won't return. Also the prices were a little high.
