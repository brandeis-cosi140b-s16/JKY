I received a nasty note from a user named Michael M. from Chandler for this review.  He has no reviews of his own and has bookmarked this page. Guess he's the owner or a manager? Rather than harass your customers, maybe you should try actually making decent food at a good price. The last thing PHX needs is more bad Mexican.

Average to below-average mexican food at uptown prices.  I know these folks get a lot of praise for their downtown location, but the food at the Tempe location did not impress me at all.   I ordered carne asada tacos and was horrified to find a thick layer of slimy guacamole in between the meat and tortilla.  Filthy :(

I'm also not down for paying $3 for a 7 cent soft drink or paying stadium prices for a beer.  

I won't be back.
