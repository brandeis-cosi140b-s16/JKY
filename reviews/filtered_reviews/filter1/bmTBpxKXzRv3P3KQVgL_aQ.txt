Review is based purely on service.  The food is good, not great - some items better than others.  Guacamole is the best thing on their menu in my opinion.

I often eat a late lunch here before I fly out, but each time I'm there the service is a bit slower, the hostess a bit more snippy.  Today was the last time I go here.

Many tables open, but hostess insisted on putting me in back of restaurant next to another table against wall.  When I asked if I could sit elsewhere so I didn't have people up on me, she said they need all the other tables for other people.  Maybe 10 tables open, and you need them all?  I said never mind, I'll eat elsewhere.  I don't do rude well, and rude and ignorant is really not good.

FYI - if you do want to try, the airport location is actually better than the one in the city!
