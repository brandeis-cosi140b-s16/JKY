The worst service I have ever had in my life. The bratty waitress with the nose ring was literally making me feel embarrassed and ashamed for even setting foot in that horrible excuse for a restaurant. Anything we asked her such as "hey can I get a refill on my cup?" Or "hey can I get more salsa?" she must have taken it as a complaint or perceived it as we were being rude? I have no clue but she was unbelievable by how bad she really was. I understand having a bad day or not feeling enthusiastic 24/7 and especially at work but it honestly felt like the waitress was trying to be the rudest she could be. The managers need to do a better job hiring people that provide a good experience to the customer rather than these rude kids. I was disgusted when I left and I don't think I will ever go here again.
