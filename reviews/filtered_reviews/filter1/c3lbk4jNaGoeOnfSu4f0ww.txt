Terrible service - period. 

I was visiting from California and went there with a large party of 30+ people to drink and eat and was confronted by an asinine, moronic, server who tried to ruin the night by, of all things, refusing to serve me drinks.  

After sitting down I asked for three margaritas (for myself and two others) and she refused. Stating only that she saw 2 people (notwithstanding the other 20+ adults) she refused to serve me - with a hostile and rude attitude to boot; as if I should have shuttered at her ogre-like voice and body.  

My conversation spiraled downward after her inappropriate remarks but to summarize... I got my drinks, had her removed as our server, reprimanded and belittled publicly, and I anticipate fired shortly. 

Apparently she claimed to be a "manager" which only makes her actions that much more inexcusable. The restaurant is no mom & pop shop. It has several locations throughout the U.S. and corporate will undoubtedly receive a scathing call from me and a litigation letter for slander. Luckily I know a great attorney with plenty of staff.  

I have never experienced such terrible service from any restaurant nor had to write such a negative review.
