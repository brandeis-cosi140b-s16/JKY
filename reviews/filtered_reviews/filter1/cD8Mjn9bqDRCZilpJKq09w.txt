I had the burrito al pastor and my girlfriend had the chicken burrito. I'm the type of foodie who likes loud flavors and enjoys a flavor combination to just wow my palate. This was not one of those experiences. It was mediocre at best. Pork was not particularly flavorful - didn't really taste like an al pastor to me. Chicken burrito was equal subpar - not much to comment about. Best part of the meal was the dos equis on tap for 5 bucks. 

I liked the container park- just look for somewhere else to grub.
