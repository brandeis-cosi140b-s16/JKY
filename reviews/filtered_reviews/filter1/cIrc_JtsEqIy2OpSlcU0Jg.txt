Not impressed at all. I spent $15.95 for the Carnitas plate. I'm a Carnitas fan and I order it whenever I try a new Mexican restaurant.

What I got was a mound of onions with pork scattered through it (and very sparsely I might add).

The best carnitas I've had to date was at two different restaurants in Goodyear: Raul & Theresa's and Manuel's. Both were quite good with Raul & Theresa's winning the gold.

The service at Arriba was decent. The decor decent. However I was extremely disappointed in the pricing and the skimpiness of their kitchen. When I order food I want FOOD. I don't want onions in my carnitas (actually it was a little carnitas in my onions).

Hey if you're an ONION fan and you want to pay $15.95 a plate for them then be my guest. However if you are a CARNITAS fan don't bother with this place.
