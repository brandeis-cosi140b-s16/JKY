Firstly -
They are not very attentive to waiting customers even though the place is no bigger than 10x10... I had to ask where my food was after waiting for about 15 minutes. The price for the guacamole and chips is overrated for the tiny bit of guacamole that you actually get. The tacos weren't bad. The chicken tacos were sweet (which was weird) and the beef taco was a bit salty for my taste.. I might be up for giving them a second chance based on the other reviews, but my first impression was horrible.
