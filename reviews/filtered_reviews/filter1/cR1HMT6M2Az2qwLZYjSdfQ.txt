Service sucks.  The hostess (surly, middle-aged blond) was unbelievably rude.  I don't know if she was having a bad day, but she did not need to take it out on customers.  No tacos are worth that attitude.  Good riddance.

(PS on Apr 3)- I see other reviews suggesting the surly middle-aged blond may have been the owner.  That is so much worse than a nasty hostess.  If I could give this place a 0 stars, I would.  :(
