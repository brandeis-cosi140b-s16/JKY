Don't often leave 1-star reviews but have no choice with this one. We went on a friends recommendation who went a day earlier, they had a great time but our experience was completely opposite.

The chips and guacamole were awesome but everything went sharply downhill after that. We waited about 45 minutes for our food (after finally complaining to the waitress and getting an eyeroll our food came out immediately). The food was mainly cold and the steak fajitas were rubbery. We all ate about half our plates and decided it was time for the check.

The restaurant was empty and waitress was nowhere to be seen for most of the night. Oh well.
