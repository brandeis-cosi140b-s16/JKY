2 words.  food poisoning
Husband and I visited Vegas at ate at Hecho on 5/27. We shared a carne asada .About 3 hrs after we ate we experienced severe gastrointestinal problems. My husband had non stop vomiting... so much that we spent that night and into the morning at a disgusting and dirty ER. We were bed ridden the next 2 days. Anyone else experience this?!!
