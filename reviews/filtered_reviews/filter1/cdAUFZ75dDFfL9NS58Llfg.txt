Would like to see that the handicap parking revised. Currently you have to walk the entire length of the restaurant to the park your car. It's quite far.  
Service was extremely slow,  granted it was a bit busy,  but there was lots of staff walking by.  Salsa was okay and the chips were okay,  nothing great.  Something to eat while passing the long wait for our lunch.  
I ordered a cheese crisp with shredded beef,  it was disgusting the way it was presented.  The meat was so wet that the crisp was no longer crispy.  It was very unappetizing.  Blah!
We couldn't get our bill fast enough to get out of there. .. definitely won't return.  There is way better Mexican around town.
