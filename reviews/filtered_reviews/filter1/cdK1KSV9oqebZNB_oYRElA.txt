Ugh. Terrible! I went their with a group of friends for brunch and we're not exactly what you would call "hipster" and got the rudest looks from both bartenders and customers alike. Sorry we don't dress like you, but that is no excuse for the amount of shade thrown our way.  Regardless, we pressed on hoping that maybe the food is good in addition to  the service from our waiter/waitress. OH HOW WRONG WE WERE. 

So we get onto the patio (which is beautiful by the way, probably one of its only redeeming qualities) and after about 10 or so minutes we finally find a table BUT NO CHAIRS. No waiter/waitress was in sight! 2 of my girlfriends had to locate chairs on our own throughout the patio and place them at our table. Call me old-fashioned but shouldn't restaurant tables have ya know, chairs?!

Anyway, we finally seated ourselves and waited for the waitress to take our orders. And waited. And waited. And waited. Finally she came over to our table and took our orders. She was pleasant enough so we had high hopes for our meal. Again, our meals took a very long time to come to us. I ordered the tortilla espanola which is supposed to be filled with potatoes, egg, etc. I swear it only had like 5 pieces of potato in it. One of the reasons why I got this dish was BECAUSE OF THE POTATOES! The menu description even said it had potatoes! SO WHERE ARE MY POTATOES?!  But I digress. 

We finished our meals and were ready to pay, but it took the waitress about 20 minutes to come get our checks. Unacceptable. 

Overall, I won't be going back there any time soon. Maybe they were having a bad morning, who knows? Regardless, the food was meh and the service was meh. The prices were too high for the amount of meh. As far as brunches go, I wouldn't recommend this place. At all.
