Ok, so a year later, I came back with the hope that the beer selection had improved.  After all, the trend is for restaurants and bars to improve craft beer selection.  I'm disappointed.  No craft beer on tap, and a couple of generic craft beers in the bottle. 

I can't imagine it would take much to get a variety of real craft beer ... several IPAs, some witbiers/hefe selections, and perhaps some stouts and porters. It would be an easy way to attract the beer aficionados with the money and interest to come in and have some quality beer. The food is GREAT, it's just that the beer selection SUCKS. Probably the last time I come into this place ... bummer.
