Came here during our visit Super Bowl weekend. Although the food wasn't terrible- we came for happy hour and there were girls coming around our table and giving away free apps and got to try their margarita, so that was nice. Can't beat free tasty food right? Well the nice experience was soon forgotten the second my boyfriend pointed out a huuuge cockroach!! It was literally the size of a small rat, and I was squirming out of disgust and freaking out as I watched it crawl around and under bar tables thinking SOMEONE would notice a huge cockroach running around. No one noticed! I had to get the hell out of there before I started puking all over the place. I will never Ever return!!! Iccckk!!
