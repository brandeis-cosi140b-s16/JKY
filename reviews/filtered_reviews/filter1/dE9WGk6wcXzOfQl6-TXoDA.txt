This food has no flavor!

Salsas were bland, not hot, not spicy. Menudo, bland no flavor, not spicy. I asked for hotter salsa to spice up the machaca and what was "medium hot" didn't have any more heat than the other two salsas that came with the chips. I have never had "Mexican" food so bland, dull and flavorless. And slow service.
You really want the food to be better but it's not.
Not worth the wait for a table.
