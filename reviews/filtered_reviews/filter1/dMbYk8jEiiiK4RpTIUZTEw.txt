Never again would I eat this terrible excuse for Chinese or Mexican food. Staff continually and politely asked: "How was your meal tonight?" All 4 diners responded, "Salty" "Greasy" "Bland" or "Lacks flavor". Everything left something to be desired. Cool decor, and great location but would never dine here again. Who makes Menonita quesadillas? That type of cheese doesn't even melt. The chef should take a sabbatical to China and/or Mexico indefinitely. Safe travels.
