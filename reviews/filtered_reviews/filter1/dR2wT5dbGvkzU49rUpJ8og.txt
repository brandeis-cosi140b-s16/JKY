They've changed the menu to Southwestern and have discontinued the tequila specials. Skip it!






Tasty Gringo style tacos, and amazing drink specials. This is probably that late night place you're looking for if you grew up in LA or San Diego. They make real guac, serve up hefty margaritas, and it's all at only-in-vegas prices. If you're losing and want to party, definitely come here. This is also a great post-club move if you want some grub. The food is freshly prepared and while nothing amazing, stands up as a decent taco joint. They're pretty damn good here and I've grown up with great tacos in Mexico and Tijuana. 

Recommended highly for value. A great place to meet up with friends. Hardly an decor or "vibe", the drinks and food do the talking. Bar/Pour service is outstanding.

At Bally's at the far end of the casino. Just head for the goal line.

Tip: on weekends you can get a 5 shot Cuervo (yes) margarita with a pretty cool souvenir glass...for $15.  Yes, five shots. Careful with that, Amigo!
