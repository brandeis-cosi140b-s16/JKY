Horrible horrible experience. We went to this restaurant specifically due to their allergy friendly menu options and rating. We announced the food allergy and she very clearly understood it when we ordered but the waitress ignored the food allergy, served us food that made one member of our party exceedingly sick, spent the night in the hospital and ruined the entire next day, our only full day in Phoenix! The manager was very nice in person but asked me to follow-up then never returned a call. I just made call number FOUR and neither Bryan Adams nor partial owner Brian Raab have responded! So disappointed. To boot, they billed us for the dinner! HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE.  Lastly, we had reserved a 845 table, were told when we arrived it wouldn't be until 915pm but then they magically got us in 2 minutes after we had drinks in hand from the bar.
