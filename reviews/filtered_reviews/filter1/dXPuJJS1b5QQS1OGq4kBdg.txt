I just visited this restaurant a few weeks ago, and it was one of the WORST in Vegas.  We were waiting a long time for the hostess to show up, and when she finally did she greeted us with an attitude.  Our waiter was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!!  I cannot express how poor the service was, because he messed up my order TWICE and very rarely came to our table.  The manager wasn't any better, because as we left the restaurant and walked by both the manager and hostess, they ignored us and didn't even thank us for our business or say "Have a good day".  I don't have unreasonable expectations of restaurant service, but my experience at La Isla was just unacceptable.
