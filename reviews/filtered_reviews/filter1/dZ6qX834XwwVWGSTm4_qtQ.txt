This used to be me and my husbands favorite place until we found two pieces of hair on to separate occasions one time dangling from my drink the next weekend it was in my husbands breakfast burrito. I wrote to them on Facebook in private message cause I didn't want to put them on blast but they didn't even apologize (on Facebook you can tell when someone sees your message)
