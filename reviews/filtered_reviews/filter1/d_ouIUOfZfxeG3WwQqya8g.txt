When we called inquire about vegetarian options and whether or not they use lard in their tortillas and beans, the hostess was clueless about food ingredients and I was placed on hold for an inordinate amount of time. After speaking to the manager, we decided to try it out. I placed an order for a less spicy pico de gallo and when it came it burned the roof of my mouth. I asked if something less spicy could be made and was told that everything is pre-made. When the entrees came (we ordered the quinoa salad and fish tacos) I found everything so incredibly spicy that I ended up finishing my kids' quesadilla! Normally love Mexican food but am for sure going to skip this place next time.
