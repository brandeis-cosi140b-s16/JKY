My wife and I went to try this place out because of the word of mouth. Well, wishing we didn't waste our time.

The owner or manager was very nice and sat us as soon as we walked in. After a few short minutes our waitress came over and took our drink orders. Was pretty shocked she didn't card us at all! That is a huge violation and I know from being in the food industry before that you need to card everyone!

After we got our drinks we sat there for nearly 25 minutes and order was never taken. I went to tell the manager/order because we just wanted to pay for our drinks and leave. We were told it was okay, didn't have to pay. 

If it was possible to give a zero I would. Service like this is really uncalled for. I will never give this place another shot again. We wasted our time for nothing. Everyone should know how bad this service is.
