We have eaten here several times before, taking out of town guests for a unique Mexican dining experience.  Last night we were extremely disappointed with our dinner.  Three of our guests had the fried fish tacos, which were small and without much flavor, even after ordering additional sauce.  The Plato Mexicano had a tamale which was dry and left uneaten by our guest.  I had the Pollo Asado, which also was extremely dry, accompanied by grilled vegetables which were raw, barely warmed and without flavor.  After spending over $100 on a poor dinner with average service, we have no intention of returning.
