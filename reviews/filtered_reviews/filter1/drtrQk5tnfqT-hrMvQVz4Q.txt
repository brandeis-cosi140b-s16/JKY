HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN-PLEASE READ

I do not know what has happened to this particular Cafe Rio. Three years ago, my wife and I decided to see what the hype was with Cafe Rio, so we decided to go to the Mesa location. We were blown away by the quality of food, the happy and customer-friendly staff, that a year later (2 years ago), we had this location cater our wedding. Once again, the management, the workers, food, were excellent that we went every other week for a year straight. 

Then, we decided to take a pretty long hiatus from Cafe Rio. I would say 3 months ago we decided to come back, and everything is different staff wise, and not in a good way. On taco tuesdays, the lines used to move efficiently with a smiling face from their workers making your food....that no longer exists. Easily can take an hour with 1/2 the line they used to have, the workers there rush your order...they just dont seem happy   being there, from the start of your food process to the payment...EVERY worker gave us, the customers bad vibes.

I went there last night, wasn't even that busy, 50 minutes to get my food. Told management the soda machines were out of ice...10 minutes go by and no one refills the machine with ice. Horchata was out, I let management know, a worker, 15 minutes later, just started working on opening the powder milk can...

These are some examples of the b.s operation going on at this location, and I would recommend to NOT go here anymore. Costa Vida is just down the road, they have much better service with same prices.
