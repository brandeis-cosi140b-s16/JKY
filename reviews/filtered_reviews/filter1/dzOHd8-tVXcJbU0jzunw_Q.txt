I have tried Baja Joes three times and each time I had a bad experience. I know why would anyone go back if they didn't like it the first time. I went there for the live music and found there wasn't any other reason to go there again. It took over an hour to get my dinner and when I asked for chips and salsa, the server told me the ran out of chips. I get that they were busy and that is why I thought I would give them a second visit. Yes, the live music brought me back again and this time the service was slow and inconsistent. My friends all complained to me. Asking why I would bring them there. For the music, I told them. My third visit and I know you are thinking 3 times? I went only for the music and still had an awful experience. The server was rude and when I complained to the manager, he was just as rude and unhelpful. After talking with him, I can see why the service and restaurant is so bad. I will not be going back another time. I will not even go there to hear the live music!! I would recommend that you go some place else!!
