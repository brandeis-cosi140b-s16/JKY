The waitstaff has come off as fairly miserable on my last few visits.  The food is either not great or inedible due to inaccurately described spiciness levels.  The last time I went, I ordered the chilaquiles off the board.  I know this dish can vary greatly between establishments, but I've had excellent luck up until now and I order it whenever I see it.

It was awful.  Firstly, it came on a plate that was about 2' long.  Thanks for the head's up, waitress.  Secondly, the eggs were so incredibly spicy that I could not eat them.  Any of them.  Since the egg portion of the meal was the size of a regular dinner plate, this was a lot of waste.  The waitress apparently thought so too, because she became agitated when I declined her offer to box it up.  

I told her I didn't want them because I couldn't eat them, because they were incredibly goddamned spicy.  She ignored that part and asked me if I would perhaps want to eat them later.  I said I figured they'd still be spicy then.  Then she asked me if I could take them home to someone.  I said I would never give this food to my animals.  THEN SHE TESTILY ASKED IF I KNEW SOMEONE ELSE I COULD GIVE THEM TO.  This B really didn't want to see the food go to waste, but wasn't super concerned that I had just purchased pounds of food that I hated.  I said no, that I wouldn't be ringing up my phone tree to see who likes their eggs with an entire jalape√±o, and as she began to angrily suggest yet another option for the reuse of the food, my dining partner interjected and said that jesus christ he would just take the bloody eggs.  Waitress needs to STFU.

Seriously?  Seriously.  This isn't the first time I've been served something I couldn't eat.  I know it's ~Richardson's~, but write "spicy" on the goddamned menu when something is spicy.  Just do it.

As for the waitress, sister needs to research some food outreach programs to volunteer for.  She's wasting too much of her vigor being shitty to customers about eggs.
