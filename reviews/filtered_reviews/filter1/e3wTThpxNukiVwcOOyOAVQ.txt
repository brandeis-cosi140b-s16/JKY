This place was absolutely terrible. The server had me YELL MY ORDER ACROSS THE ROOM.

Our food was disgusting, wilted and contained mystery ingredients and missing others. The manager comped our entire meal and drinks then offered us dessert to go. It was so bad, we declined. So horrible! Be warned! Holy rotten macaroni! 

Guys seated nearby us left when we did, shook my hand for saying something to them. Absolutely beyond ridiculous.
