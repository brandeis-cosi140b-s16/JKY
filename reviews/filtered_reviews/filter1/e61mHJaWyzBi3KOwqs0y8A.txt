Went there with my group of bff's and we were extremely excited to try out this new place when it had barely opened. Unfortunately, I later realized that their prices made me feel like I had spent more than what I bargained for.  Way too much hype surround this place.

I had their carne asada quesadilla and carne asada tacos, the meat lacked flavor and none of the salsas were hot enough. It borders on authentic but it didnt do the trick for me. Plus the art inside looks too much like Rubio's, too bad its more expensive than Rubio's. 

By the way, most of this food is available south of this establishment around 16th St and Van Buren in roach coaches for a much cheaper price and with salsas que de veras valen la pena y pican.
