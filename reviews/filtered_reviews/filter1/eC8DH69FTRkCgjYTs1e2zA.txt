It's a beautiful restaurant in a fun location but the food was not good. The margaritas were Ok but overpriced.  I had tacos and they were very small. You get 3 in an order but they do not allow you to mix and match. Why? I would have liked that option and most (if not all?) Mexican restaurants allow that. My husband ordered fajitas and they were also not good.  There was a large grilled onion on top which was weird. Are you supposed to make a fajita with a big piece of onion then have no onion left for the rest?? He didn't think the meat (what little there was) was very good either. Next time we go to the linq we'll try some place else. There are too many great Mexican restaurants in town (Javier's I'm thinking of you) to ever go back.
