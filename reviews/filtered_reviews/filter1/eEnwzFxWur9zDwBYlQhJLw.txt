Worst Mexican restaurant I've ever been to, and we are FAR from picky eaters. My husband & I were really looking forward to coming here based on the good reviews. I decided to come on my birthday, what a disappointment! The beans they serve with the chips before your meal taste like they literally took a can of pinto beans and dumped it into a bowl w/out doing anything else to it. This was easier to deal with considering they're complimentary. However, we ordered the queso fondue dip expecting it to be a creamy cheese fondue like we've had at other restaurants, but it tasted like they just took a block of mozzarella and warmed it up in a microwave then served it, for $10 at that. You couldn't even scoop it up on a chip. By this time I was already extremely disappointed and regretted coming here, but our main dishes were already on the way. They were equally as gross and cheap tasting. I was so bummed that this wasn't the "authentic" Mexican cuisine they claimed to have. I love most Mexican food but this was expensive, canned garbage! I also agree w/ a previous reviewer who said their busser gave better service than their waiter. We had terrible service to top off the terrible food. Save yourself the disappointment, there are plenty of awesome Mexican restaurants in Vegas for half the price!
