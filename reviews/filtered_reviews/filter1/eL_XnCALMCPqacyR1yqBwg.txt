My wife and I waited 45 minutes, but our order never came.  It was mid-day on a Saturday and the place was not that busy.  The waiter reassured us several times that our order would be coming right up, but it never did. So we left and went to the food court.

All I can say is go there at your own risk.  Service is horrendous, and they are not honest about the when your food is going to arrive.
