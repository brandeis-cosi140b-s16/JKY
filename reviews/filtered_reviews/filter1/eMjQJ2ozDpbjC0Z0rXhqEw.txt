Just had lunch here. It took one hour for our food to come out...and they were not busy..... 4 other tables came and went as we sat. Unfortunately the wait was not worth it. The food was awful and very overpriced ($3.00 for "chips and salsa" which consists of about 17 bad, stale, over salted corn chips and 2 servings of salsa in small plastic cups.. about an ounce each) (Our taco lunch was $33.00)... The chicken tasted like dog food... told the server about that it an "off" taste... I thought she was going to punch me...  I asked what it was marinated in.. she was angry... offensive...and she didn't even know... she offered to replace it... no thanks... how would it be different than what we were served.. and... we certainly didn't have time to wait another hour. Also had carne asada taco... the beef was very tough like rubber. Server was rude... did not offer to discount the tab...   could not wait to get out of there..  will never go again. .
