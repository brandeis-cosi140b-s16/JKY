Drove from Queen Creek to the Pecos and Lindsey location for a to-go order and trip to the park after with the kids. I paid 20 dollars for my food and asked for a cup of water. They handed me a tiny plastic cup, to which I begged for a cup with a lid. After arguing with the manager for 5 min with a toddler in my arm and two kids running around. I left pretty annoyed at the place for not sparing a 5 cent cup that would make all the difference in this momma's world to take to the park with A LID.  I didn't get one.

This may seem petty, but they also got my order wrong and therefore I came to the conclusion that if I make the effort to drive all that way, spend a good amount on a couple tacos and burrito, I expect a business to return the kindness even if it is as simple as a cheap water cup with a lid,  and getting the order right.

The food was decent, but I won't be back. Consider the customer service when you decide to satisfy your Mexican food craving.
