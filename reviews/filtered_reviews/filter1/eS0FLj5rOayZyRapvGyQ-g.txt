We received probably the worst service we've ever had. We had 3 different waiters each only came to our table once. We only received one drink refill that took a half hour to get. The food was the worst mexican food imaginable. Think taco bell but they have chimichangas. Our order took forever to fill and was brought to the table wrong, so we waited again. Even after a comp meal and $15 off our dinner for 5 and an appetizer (queso and guac, a small soup bowl of semi soft cheese and a plate with a mashed avocado $8.5)  still cost over $60. Left a small tip and we will never be back.
