Ok, so this place is pretty nice looking, and decent sized, a bit of an odd layout though...  I felt like you definitely paid for that.  Opening night, THURSDAY, and NO SPECIALS.  I mean really?  This is still a college town right?  5 bucks for a (warm) beer, 6.50 for jager, and the typical 8 bucks for patron...    The dj wasnt really sucking me in either...  Overall, Id say this is a nice place with some potential as long as you arent looking for cheap drinks.
