Quite honestly I didn't have very high expectations for this place and what do you know - we didn't like ANY of the food we ordered. I got the chicken enchiladas plate with cilantro lime rice & black beans; my boyfriend got the shrimp enchilada and shredded beef taco combo plate with the borracho beans & latin fried potatoes. The enchilada sauce that the chicken enchiladas were smothered in was alright but unfortunately, the rice was undercooked to the point of crunchy and the black beans were just plain tasteless. The taco tasted like the shell was stale and the borracho beans tasted like they were cooked pinto beans on which someone had poured beer and served. The fried potatoes were really mushy & oily and salty.

When we had walked in to get a table, all we saw were people drinking huge margaritas. Apparently they must've known what we didn't - don't bother ordering any food .. or order after having a few drinks. Each of our meals were $7.57. I could've gotten a better deal at Taco Bell.
