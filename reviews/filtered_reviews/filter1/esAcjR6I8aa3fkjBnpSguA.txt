This place is terrible. Everything is ultra salty, horribly tasteless, and completely overpriced. The only edible thing were the tacos, but it was definitely not worth the $$. Not only was the food a huge letdown, the service also sucked! The waiter was not friendly and kept pressuring us to buy the most expensive items on the menu. I love both Chinese and Mexican foods so the concept of the restaurant had a lot of potential, but China Poblano definitely didn't deliver on the culinary experience. Unfortunately, the only things going for this place are the cool/weird decor and interesting concept.
