To be fair, I wrote an e-mail to the General Manager first, and he didn't respond after over a week so here's my update.  Went for lunch a week and a half ago, it was for my daughters birthday lunch and she loves Cantina 1511 as does my whole family.  

The restaurant had a large number of flies, so much so that they impeded my families enjoyment of their lunch.  The flies were pretty bad during the chips and salsa stage but got worse when the meal arrived.  They asked to be moved and they were accommodated.  Once they moved a Manager (female) came over and offered a lame explanation about it being summer and flies are to be expected.  

  They finally left after paying for their meal which couldn't be eaten because they were pretty disgusted because of the fly issue.  It was a slow lunch day and not many people were in the restaurant.  They left after splitting the bill with the other party, the bill was around $60.00 ($28.22 which was half the bill).  

 Normally we like the restaurant and my wife who isn't a complainer her opinion is that she doesn't want to go back, which, I'm sure isn't what they want to hear  My kids didn't want to eat the food they boxed up and brought home because of the memories of the flies.  My wife has worked in restaurants for many years and I am in the commercial food industry, and we know there are sprays out there that can eliminate flies.  The managers explanation simply doesn't cut it and it sounds like she needs some retraining on how to respond to customer issues.
