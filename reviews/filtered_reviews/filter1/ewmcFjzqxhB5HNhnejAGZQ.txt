Bad, bad, bad. 

My mom was in the mood for Mexican food while we were visiting Westgate for the Sidewalk Chalk Festival, so we decided to try it out. 

Worst food I've had. Period. I had the carne asada tacos. The meat was chewy and grisly, the beans and rice were lukewarm and the rice wasn't fully cooked. My mom had the chicken burrito. It was dry and very bare. It was filled with tons of lettuce and all tortilla. This food was just awful. 

Our waitress was ok. As we were leaving a guy approached and said we shorted the waitress $10, which we totally did by accident. He was very polite about it and we even tipped a little extra for the mistake. Oops.
