This place deserved no stars.. It's called Chevys fresh mex but there wasn't nothing fresh about it.. The food tasted like I went home and warmed up leftovers in the microwave. Just horrible. Service was horrible.. This place really made my valentines day a total BLOW.. The "head hancho" gave us 20% off it should have been 50% off it was that bad.. Never will I eat here again...
