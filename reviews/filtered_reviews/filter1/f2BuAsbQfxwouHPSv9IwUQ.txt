Ok, so me and my bf went here with a groupon. All i have to say is that i am sooooo glad it was with a groupon because if i had paid regular price i would have been upset.

Lets start off with, we got seated quickly. That was a good start, but from then on it went down hill. We got TERRIBLE service. We weren't the only ones either because i heard the people sitting around us commenting about the horrible service they were getting also. Finally when the waitress came around, we ordered the sampler platter and the signature margarita. The food was mediocre...you would think for the price is would be wow! but it was "ehhh". The drink also was nothing special for the price and for their "signature". We didn't bother ordering anything else because for us, it wasn't worth it.

To sum it up, i should have checked out yelp before buying the groupon, but oh well. You never really know until you try something for yourself. Anyways, I don't like this place and i wouldn't refer anyone to it either.
