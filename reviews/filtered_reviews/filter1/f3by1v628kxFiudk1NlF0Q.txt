Ew. This was our first meal when we checked in-we were hungry and ready to get our margarita on! And what do you know? 2 for 1 deal! Wahoo, right? NO! Ick....hostess was straight up RUDE, server was a nice older Spanish woman. She recommended the shrimp tacos. They were not good. The beans were like something you would see in a public restroom toilet. The beer selection was crappy, and the tequila was overpriced. We ate our crappy meals, grumbled about the price and quickly moved on to better options! SKIP!
