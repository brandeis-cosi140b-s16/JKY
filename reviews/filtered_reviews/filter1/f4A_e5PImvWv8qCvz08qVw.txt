How do you say "this place sucks" in Spanish? "Muy mala" seems too nice. First, their service is all about sales. "Want to start with our most overpriced and unsatisfying menu items? Because if not we'll judge you." That sort of thing. I did enjoy the well margarita, but for $9 more than five sips over ice would be nice. 

And the food. Puta madre. La comida was beyond bad. It is actually MEAN to serve food this dull and charge this much for it. The carnita tacos were dry, flavorless, and lazy. The mole was a one-note paste over dry chicken enchiladas. Both astoundingly overpriced. Funny how often fancy Mexican places make you nostalgic for cheap ones. This place is all style, no substance.
