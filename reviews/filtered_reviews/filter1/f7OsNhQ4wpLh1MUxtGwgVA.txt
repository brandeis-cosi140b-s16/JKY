On my last visit to Tempe last Friday the 5th of December, myself and my business partner dined at z Tejas. After having marginal service we were less than impressed. We both ordered the Rib Eye steak which was sub par at best. Shortly after leaving I became extremely sick, vomiting as well as, becoming dizzy and disoriented. It got so bad that I had to go to Tempe St. Luke's Hospital. After being immediately wheel back into the ER I was treated for Severe Dehydration and Food Poisoning. The PA on staff who treated me stated that it is very possible that it came from the food i had at Z Tejas. Needless to say I'm very disappointed in the professional standards of this restaurant. This was a place in California that I frequented and enjoyed. After my last experience with food poisoning after eating here sadly I will never return to the restaurant. I caution all patrons to be aware of your food while eating here and if you do choose to dine here make sure your food is prepared appropriately. Hopefully upper management will address this issue and eradicate what ever problem is responsible for causing it.
