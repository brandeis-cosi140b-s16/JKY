Labeling this as a "Mexican" restaurant is like saying everyone can afford Gucci.

My husband and I each had appetizers, two happy hour beers and chips. Worst $37 spent. The taquitos I had tasted like something out of a frozen dinner meal. They also had no limes for the beers. Really? You're gonna gimmie a lemon instead? Wow. Never again.
