Skip this place!!!

Strawberry margarita is in a 16oz glass that's $13 and just tasted like a sugary strawberry slushy. I asked where the alcohol was and the waitress just said its because you ordered strawberry flavored. Ummm, no. She wanted to charge $1 extra for another shot. So, I just cancelled and ordered water. 

My food: a flavorless steak taco with a chicken enchilada that tasted like it was frozen. 
Overall: overpriced and most importantly not good! :(
