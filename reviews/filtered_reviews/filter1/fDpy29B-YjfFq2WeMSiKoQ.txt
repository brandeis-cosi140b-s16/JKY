Another business that doesn't get it. First off, I walked in here and the cook was in the middle of rolling the garbage cans outside or somewhere. Then I start looking at the menu board and the cook appears in the kitchen window offering suggestions, but failing to wash his hands. In between those two instances, I ask the Mexican women if there is a combo that doesn't include their nasty, fatty beef? Nope, whatever the menu says cannot be changed. So, if you want their chicken then you have to order everything ala carte, but if you want their chicken and beef then you are allowed to get the $7.99 combo? Makes no sense, but I hope for the guy's sake that ordered the whole chicken right after I left that the cook washed his hands, but that would be wishful thinking for this unfriendly dive.
