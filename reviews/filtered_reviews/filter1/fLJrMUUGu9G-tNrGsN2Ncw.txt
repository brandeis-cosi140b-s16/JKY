I'm disappointed to write this review since I have eaten at fuzzys several times over the past couple years. This is a delivery/food quality review. On 5/15/14 I placed an order for delivery for nachos, two chicken tacos, chips & salsa, and rice & black beans at 5:16 pm. An hour later and still no food. I called the manager and she told me the food was finished and waiting to be delivered. 45 minutes passed and finally the food arrives ( so my food was sitting for 30 minutes before being taken to be dropped off) yuck. The food arrives and the nachos are luke warm and extremely soggy. Immediately tossed in the garbage. The chips had not been seasoned like listed in the online description. The tortilla from our tacos fell apart from absorbing so much moisture and they were luke warm as well. I called back and the manager said "sometime that happens with delivery" ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? She offered no kind of apology or compensation. Just unbelievable. After tossing the rest of the food, my boyfriend and I both agreed Taco Bell would have been a tastier route instead of wasting 40 bucks on the half-assed soggy concoctions we received. Never ordering from here again. If your in the south Scottsdale/Tempe area "El Molinos" is a more reliable option for delivery Mexican.
