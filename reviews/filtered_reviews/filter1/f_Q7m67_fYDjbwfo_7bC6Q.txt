Guy gave my friend and I wristbands - we declined, he followed us, we declined, he said he'd walk us over and get us a VIP couch and he was really friendly so we said okay fine. We get there, he directs us to a man in a suit that looks like a manager and says we're special customers. Manager acts all friendly and welcoming. 

We realize the deal is with a wristband you get into the bar without the cover charge IF you buy a drink as soon as you walk in the door. Considering how many bars offered us wristbands to get into clubs that would give us free drinks we weren't super interested but hadn't chosen anywhere else to go so decided to check it out. My friend and I look at the menu outside to see what their selection is and our escort excused himself back to his duties. 

While we looked at the menu a few people jumped in line where we had been standing. We figured the drinks sounded good so we'd go in. We wait in line for 10 minutes while the bouncer and cashier give what was apparently the slowest service ever. We approached the manager looking guy and asked if we could go in past the line since we were getting sick of waiting. This guy literally looked at us and turned away. I guess once they get you in line you aren't a VIP anymore (or everyone is, so no one is).

After that the bouncer looks at our IDs and we get shuffled into the cashier line to wait again, instead of just being allowed to go to the bar since we didn't have to pay the cover if buying drinks (supposedly).

They has some good sounding cocktails on the menu, but knowing the drinks would be $13 each and with the continued waiting and obvious waste of time, we left having only just got passed the bouncer. 

Did I mention this was on a Sunday at like 10? Because it was. When there are infinite choices, Diablo's Cantina, you shouldn't give people the inkling to walk away because your bar doesn't look worth the wait.
