1 word. suck. I went there on 1/31/09. Wow just wow. I wish I had the waiters name but really it shouldnt be to hard to pick off since it was a sunday night and we were one of three tables on the patio. Drinks went empty, waiter took forever to get order and return at any point in time, seriously a $17 enchilada. come'on. I am sure there is some sort of trade off between service and food price at some restaurants but definitely not here. I will certainly not be back to this one.
