Customer service is key. A group of 4-6 of us usually go to Paradise for happy hour once every week or two. Last night, we brought at least 25 people for a birthday party. Two of us started out before happy hour drinking Dos Equis 12 oz bottles for $6. When happy hour started, we wanted to switch to 36oz draft Dos Equis draft for $7 which is their special. They were out of draft and wouldn't give us the same price. 

I tried to explain to the waitress (who was clearly unhappy to be there) that I shouldn't be charged the same price for one third of a drink that was only one dollar less. If it is something on their menu that they are able to provide, they should. She disagreed. I received our bill which for two people, was $87. I again tried to plead with the manager/bartender explaining this was ridiculous. We were with a big group, spent a lot of money, come weekly, and it was the right thing to do since it was their fault they were out of a special on a Saturday night. He disagreed. 

Unfortunately, I used to love this place but they lost a good customer. I've always stood by coming here even though most people argue against me. Just frustrating I guess.
