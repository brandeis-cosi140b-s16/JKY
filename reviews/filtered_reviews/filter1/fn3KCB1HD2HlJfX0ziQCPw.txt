I was expecting better service from this Mexican restaurant in the Linq
we were seated outside - after 25 minutes i flagged down a bus boy to see if he could inform our server we were here.  Our server showed up a couple of minutes later only to inform us, he was "hanging out doing nothing on the otherside of the glass"
I ordered fish tacos, without sauce 1 fried 2 grilled.  The 3 grilled fish tacos showed up, cold with sauce - no apology from the server or request to see if they should be remade.  He did ask if i wanted more cabbage to put on top.

The tableside guacamole was expensive for 1 and a half small avocados, and i had to request the remainder of the guacamole that was left in the serving bowl, be added to what was served.

I will not return - overpriced and bad service not a good combination
