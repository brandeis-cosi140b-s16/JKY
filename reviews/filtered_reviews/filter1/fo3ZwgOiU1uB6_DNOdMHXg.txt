We waited about a half an hour for a table after being told 15 minutes. When we walked in there were empty tables everywhere and only a couple of people had left while we were waiting. The food was horribly overpriced for the quality and they charged $3.00 for a side of sour cream or guacamole, each. Our bill was $60 for only two people and we didn't even have an appetizer. Just one soda and one cocktail. We went with friends and because there were 6 of us total, not including an infant, they put a 20% gratuity on each of our tickets automatically not the standard 17%-18%. I am usually a generous tipper and if you impress me I will give you a 20% without batting an eye. The server was not impressive. He was curt almost to the point of being rude and did not deserve more than 15%. We will never go back here again!
