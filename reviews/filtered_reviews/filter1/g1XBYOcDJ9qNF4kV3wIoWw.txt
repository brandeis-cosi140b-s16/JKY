On probation. The last time we went, we sat at the bar and ordered, everything went smoothly. This time, 6:45pm on a Saturday, not busy at all, took forever to get drinks, even longer for someone to come take our food order. We asked to split checks and the waiter said he didn't know how, then he no longer waited on us? We had to hunt someone down to ask for the check b/c we had reservations elsewhere. The next day, someone in the party had their creidt card charged an extra $14 on a $10 bill. Food was lukewarm at best, lost drink orders, and tacos were overpriced. Move on down the road next time!
