Went to Carlos 'n Charlies for Friday night drinks before going out. The patio was PACKED to capacity (probably 300-400 people) and the bar was staffed with TWO bartenders. Friends of mine waited 50 minutes to get service, I wasn't able to get anything from their bar. Their bar definitely has the capacity for 12-15 servers, I'm not sure why their management routinely understaffs the bar...
