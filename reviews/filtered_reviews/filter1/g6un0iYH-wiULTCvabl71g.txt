Worst food and drinks ever! You have to try to screw up Mexican food this bad. If you can't call yourself a restaurant, then you should at least be able to call yourself a bar. Terrible!

Salsa was like water, guacamole tasted like it came from a bag, margaritas must have had perfume in them. Therefore, once disappointed, we thought it would be safe to order a beer, but even that stunk. Came out in a can. Who serves beer in a can at a restaurant.

Between 4 people for an entree and drink our bill was $95. They should pay us to eat and drink this crap!
