Horrible. I have been to this place several times and every time it gets worse. 
My friend and I walked up to the hostess and instead of her greeting us, we had to greet her! She gave us a dirty look because we must have interrupted her and then led us outside past several "clean" tables to a dirty table. 

She gave us our menus which I could barely even read! All the ink was faded and the menus were dirty! Why even keep menus like that? 

I ordered the Sonoran margarita which was extremely sugary. 
For food, I ordered the carne Asada street tacos. They would have been fine but the flour tortillas were hard. I couldn't even eat them!

As we were eating the employees were throwing, yes throwing, couches behind the five guys restaurant next door. If I was the owner, I'd be pissed.

I guess this place doesn't pride themselves on food, customer service, and atmosphere anymore.
