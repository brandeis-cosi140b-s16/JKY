We really got duped! It's hard for me to imagine worse food than the garbage this place is dishing out. The service was also pretty lackluster, and the atmosphere made me feel kinda sad. I understand I'm going to pay a lot more for a meal because of where I am, but I expect an attempt at quality. Whoever is responsible for this is a true scam artist.
