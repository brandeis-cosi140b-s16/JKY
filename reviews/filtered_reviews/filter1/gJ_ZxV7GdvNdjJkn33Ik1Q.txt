I have to say that I normally LOVE Cafe Rio, but this location has let me down. It's close to home but I can't continue to patronize them. Every time I go they mess up my order. The last time when I went in there was a pile of trash that had been swept right in front of the counter, just left there. Gross. The women's restroom was broken so my Mom had to use the men's and she said it was filthy. I got my usual pork salad and I've been sick for 3 days now since I ate it, and I only ate maybe a fourth of it. The girl who took my order over the phone was rude as well. It's a shame because I know that other locations are good. My advice is to avoid the west Sahara store at all costs!
