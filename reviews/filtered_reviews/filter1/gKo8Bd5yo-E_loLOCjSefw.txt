As a tourist we came to eat here on a Friday night yet it was CLOSED for a private party. It got good reviews, but how can you be closed on a Friday night in a tourist town with your of notification is a piece of paper on the window. On a Friday? Very poor. Then make you sit outside without offering at least water while waiting for a cab?
