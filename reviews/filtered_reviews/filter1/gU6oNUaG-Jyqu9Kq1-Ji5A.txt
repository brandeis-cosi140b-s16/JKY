After eating at plenty of great places around Vegas, this place was absolutely disappointing. There's a lot to say, so I'll keep it to bullet points:

- For this price $38, the steaks were tough, under seasoned, and overdone.
- Service was horrible. Water was warm, server was inattentive, sour cream was liquid.
- The worst part, saw multiple busboys wipe down tables, then wipe plates with the same towel.

Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Do yourself a favor and keep walking.
