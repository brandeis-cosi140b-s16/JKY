Foods good but the service has slowly became close to awful bussers are better than the servers at serving the tables.... Owner yells at his staff a lot in front of customers and not in a good way. When busy everything seems chaotic for the staff like they can't handle it when they used to be able to?? I've been coming 3 to 4 times a month for years and watched the service literally become worse. I'll have good service once in awhile. Service used to never be this bad especially when they first opened up. Mind as well tip the busser they do a better job than the wait staff...
