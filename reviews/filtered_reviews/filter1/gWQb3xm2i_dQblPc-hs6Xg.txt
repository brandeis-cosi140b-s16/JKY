The food was decent, the prices were alright (for Vegas), but the service was TERRIBLE!  If it weren't for the fact that I have moral issues with getting up and leaving without paying (even if we have only had drinks) I would have done it.
Our waiter not only left halfway through our meal (without telling anyone), but even when he was there, everything (from drink order to drink reception) took at least 20 minutes minimum.  Our food order (which was soups and appetizers) took well over 45 minutes to come out.
Another thing... My grandma ordered the tortilla soup, and it looked (and tasted) a lot like the Texas chili.  It just had tortilla strips added.
I think they are more used to people who are wasted and don't keep track of the normal details that restaurant service requires.  I would NEVER recommend this place, sober or drunk.  But hey, if it's 4:30am and no where else is serving food for your munchies, then it works.
