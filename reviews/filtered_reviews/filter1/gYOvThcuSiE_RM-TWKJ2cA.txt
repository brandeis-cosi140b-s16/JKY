Don't go here.  We ended up here because we got a really good deal off of the Radio Shopping Show.  Read the reviews and decided to stop by anyway. (We were close, at the Linq, family night.) Worst idea. 
Our waiter was nice,  felt bad for the guy. The rest of the staff was very unprofessional. Bussers/waiters walking around with their shorts hanging off their butts; waitresses in tank tops with boobs almost falling out. A bartender trying to hit on me on my way to the bathroom. 
We ordered mini burgers for the kids, husband ordered a carne asada taco salad,  and I ordered a burrito. The kids food came out first; they enjoyed it.  Then the taco salad, which came out of a prepackaged bag and with chicken on it, not carne asada . Had to send it back. Everyone was halfway into dinner,  and still no burrito.  So I ate one of the mini burgers, which wasn't bad.  Watched my husband eat what looked like the worst meal he ever had....  Still no burrito.  I asked for the check and for my food to go.  Fifteen minutes later we got our check,  and the waiter kindly told us the salad and burrito would both be taken off the check.  I couldn't wait any longer to get out of the place so I told him just to keep it. 
No doubt this place needs some serious help.  It wasn't worth my time.
