Terrible experience. Maybe the waitress was just having a bad night but her whole demeanor made me feel like I was bothering her. We asked for a drink menu and were told that they were upstairs. ( we had been sat downstairs) We went to the front and asked for a drink menu, no problem. 

The best part of our whole night was the guy who makes balloon animals. 

The service was super slow. The waitress never checked to make sure out meals were correct or to see if we needed anything else.  It took forever to get refills. 

She brought us boxes for our leftovers than disappeared, while we waited for our check. After about 10 minutes we went to the front to ask for our check. As we had 2 small children we were ready to leave.

We requested split checks. Our fault for not double checking, however the waitress had jumbled the whole thing. My card was charged, then voided ( will update on that), then charged for the correct amount. 

Not once had the waitress apologized for her lousy service. Needless to say, we did not tip. I have never been so dissatisfied with a restaurant. Absolutely will NOT return in this lifetime.


After rating a few days (probably because of the credit card company) the original charge that was voided did not process through.
