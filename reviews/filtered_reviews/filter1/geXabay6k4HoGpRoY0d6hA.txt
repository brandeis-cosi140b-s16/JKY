I will start with the pros... The atmosphere is good. Montford is a fun place to go to dinner in Charlotte. Our waiter was pretty good although we didn't all get our food at the same time (6 of us). 

The cons...  The food. The shrimp taco was bland and pasty. The pork taco was so salty it was completely inedible. The corn, which I had heard was wonderful, was also inedible. It was dripping in some type of ranch sauce. Two of the 6 people at our table had BONES in their chicken taco and chicken salad.  I really wanted to like it, but Unless they make some serious kitchen changes, you couldn't pay me to go back.
