My friends & I have talked about going here for weeks especially since we live down the street.. They literally have 4 meal options.. Burger and 3 dif tacos (shortrib,chicken,vegi). On a wednesday around dinner time they were out of the short rib taco.. So I was stuck with chicken, cause no vegetarian taco is worth 3 dollars..  Super slow even with 6 people working and they were more interested in goofing around like high school gym class. 

**Here is a suggestion, so if you are out of short ribs or chicken why not have other options like ground beef or steak.. Problem Solved!!  Obviously there is no chef/cook  to make such as easy suggestion!
