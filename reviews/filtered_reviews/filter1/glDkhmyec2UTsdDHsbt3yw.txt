This place doesn't deserve a star. It deserves a chupacabra to come and destroy the place. my order came out cold. the cheese enchiladas had a dark red sauce that looked like deer blood & tasted like dirt. The cheese inside wasn't gooey hot cheese but instead little bits of minced white cheese that had the texture & color of tofu. I'm not even sure if it actually was cheese? Low grade dog food would've tasted better than the chips, and the salsa tasted like bum piss.
