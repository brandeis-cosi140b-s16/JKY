I am so disappointed with the food at this place. I ordered the carnitas and seta tacos and a side order of brussel sprouts.

Everything was just drenched in oil and I'm pretty sure there was more of that than any other ingredient in my plate. I've been here two different times and its been exactly the same. Sorry China Poblano - I don't see what the hype is about.
