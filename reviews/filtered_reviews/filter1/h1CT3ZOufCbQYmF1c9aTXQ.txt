If your choice is to not eat and starve. Or eat here. Please choose to starve. Dirty and gross. Rude staff. And horrid inedible food. I don't usually do negative reviews but this place was that bad. Even for airport food. Worst I've ever had. There are far better choices at this airport. Please make a better decision than I did.
