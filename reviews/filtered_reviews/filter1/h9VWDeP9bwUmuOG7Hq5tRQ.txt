Terrible, Terrible, Terrible customer service! This is the only delivery place that has breakfast; I don't have a car. I have ordered from this place at least 6 times, each time a bad experience. I understand people having a bad day, but not once have I talk to someone on the phone without attitude or treating me like I am inconveniencing them. They have never delivered to me on time, EVER! I ordered for delivery online a few mins past 9am. It said my delivery would be here at 9:58am. I wait until 1030am to call and ask them where my food is. The guy said "He left about 10 mins ago. He should be there any minute. If he doesn't know up in the next 15, I will call to find out where my driver is." ..... ooookay.... 10 mins go by, the delivery guy shows up at my door. Almost irritated, no smile, no apology. I ordered a Two by Four (2 scrambled eggs with 4 pancakes), hot chocolate and vanilla iced coffee with extra x2 vanilla. The eggs and pancakes are luke warm, not to mention I only got 3 pancakes, the bacon is cold and dry, and the coffee was iced black coffee. Terrible.
