This place is just bad. We were delayed over 5 hours coming home from Vegas and needed somewhere to eat lunch. Decided on this place and was not the best idea.

Ordered chips and salsa - the chips were not fresh, not even close to Tostitos quality. They were just bland bagged tortilla chips and the salsa was so watery and flavorless.

I ordered tacos with carne asada and I would have enjoyed a can of dog food more than I enjoyed this. The meat was really gross and the rice tasted like soggy nothing.

Don't go here. You're better off going to Burger King.
