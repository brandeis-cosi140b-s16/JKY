Went in to order takeout, they were busy and took forever with my order. When I got home they had given me menudo instead of the Pozole I ordered. So I basically drove 20 minutes, waited forever, got home and was given the wrong thing. I absolutely hate menudo. So that was a huge waste of time and money.
