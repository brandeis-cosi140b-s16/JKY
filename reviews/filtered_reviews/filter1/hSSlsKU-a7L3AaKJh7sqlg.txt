Ugh, we were so excited to try this new location.  We went today for happy hour.  The food was awful, I bit into a taquito and I got a mouthful of greasy beef chunk.  I had to spit it out and put it to the side.  I couldn't take another bite.  The guacamole looked and tasted like out of a bag.  Even the premium margarita was not good.  I was so disappointed since they are close to our home.  Won't be coming back, ever.
