Well that was disappointing.  Can't summon any humor for how disappointing that was.  Great first impression, nice big open airy restaurant, patio was open and has tiled tables, fireplace, pretty windows with big leafy designs, dug it, even talked about maybe moving the rehearsal dinner here.

That would've been a mistake.  

Seated, were given chips and salsa.  They were fine.  Server stopped by asking if we needed a few more minutes.  Fiancee responded we needed a few more menus.  My order were their seafood enchiladas, and chipotle albondigas.  The soup was oily and the meatballs fell apart upon contact, so were a bit too mushy.  Some nice spiciness, but just too greasy and broth too thin.  57 minutes after ordering our entrees showed up.  What a joke.  Billed as seafood enchiladas, mushy enchiladas filled with 1 part shrimp and fake crabmeat 9 part cheese.  Couldn't taste the seafood at all.  Ranchero sauce was fine.  Beans and rice were acceptable.  Overheard server say to another table "Was it at least okay?"  

No.  Never again.  What a total waste of 1.5 hours.
