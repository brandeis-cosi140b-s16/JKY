What a waste of money. The portions are so small. I understand it's supposed to be like tapas, but $8.88 for a pork sandwich the circumference of a tennis ball? Really?? I wasn't impressed by this place. We ordered a few dishes per person and weren't really happy with any of them. Also it took them half an hour to fill our waters. 

The only plus was the nice GM that came by to check on us. 

Just head to Spring Mountain and eat something legit and delish for the same price of one of these dishes AND be full.
