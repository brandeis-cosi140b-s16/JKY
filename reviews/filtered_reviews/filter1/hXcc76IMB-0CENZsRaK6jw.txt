This is my second review of Arriba Mexican Grill in Glendale and I'm sorry to say, this will be my last because I am not going to return to this place again.  

Again, the stacked beef enchilada's were void of any flavor at all!  Although the food presented well, I mean, it looked good but my goodness, it was just terrible.  The bland meat was simply browned in a skillet without any flavoring at all and then shoved on to a corn tortilla and then covered with what was supposed to be red chili sauce.   There was supposed to be some of those world famous Hatch green chilies mixed in with the meat as well but again - zip, nothing.

When our waiter finally came by I asked for some chili on the side and a beer thinking I could salvage this mess but after a long long wait, still no chili and no beer.  Finally, my wife caught his eye and a few minutes later I had my request on the table but it was no use, this meal was dead. 

What a disappointment.  I know this restaurant can make pretty good New Mexican food but something has changed at this store - either the manager is cutting corners by saving money on spices or she is just incompetent because this place is capable of better service and better food, I just haven't seen it in a long time.  

What a disappointment.  I was anxious to leave this bad experience behind but it wasn't that easy.  No check.  Again, poor service - then at last, after about 15 minutes our AWOL waiter finally shows up with our check and we are at last able to leave our 1/2 eaten meals behind.
