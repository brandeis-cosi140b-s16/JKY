I wish I could write a zero.  They clearly don't give a damn about good service, they'll survive on Friday and Saturday alone so they can suck all week.  I brought in 10 guys on a Monday night.  They messed up 10 orders.  As slow as possible with everything wrong.  Stay away? Go somewhere that they care about customers, this isn't your place.
