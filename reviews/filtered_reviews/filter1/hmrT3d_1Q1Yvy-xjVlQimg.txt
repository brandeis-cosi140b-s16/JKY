Good food ruined by a game-playing waitress.  I could tell she was irritated that we didn't order margaritas or appetizers.  When the four of us (me and three kids) ordered two fajitas to share, I guess it really pissed her off.   We've been going to this Chevy's for over ten years, and always order the same thing.  Today, it angered a new waitress. When the food came, the chicken fajitas were ok, but the Mixed Grill meats were much tinier than usual and the "steak" looked dried out.  The waitress brought one bag of 3 tortillas, old, hard, stuck together and folder over in the bag,then walked off.  I asked to see a manager and out comes the "kitchen manager" - yeah, the guy who slighted us on the portions, who explained that fajitas (which are over $18) are for one person.  BUT he agreed to bring more meat out.  He brought out a bit more of the carnitas only.  A different waiter brought the check.  If this is how they intend to treat their good customers, that is their right.  It is my right to go to another restaurant. It's not like we're cheapskates.  The bill for lunch for 4 was almost $60.  Never again.
