This is a terrible over priced restaraunt! Don't waste your money on the horrible food and service here. Our server want too enthused to be helping us. We ordered chips and guacamole, both seemed to be prepackaged, I was really hoping for some home made chips! These seemed to be Tostitos chips from the grocery store. We ordered a chicken quesadilla and chicken tacos. The quesadilla was better than the tacos but that's not saying much. The tacos were nasty.. Reminded me of cafeteria food. It would have been one thing if we paid $6. But we ordered chips, guacamole, tacos, an ice tea, and a quesadilla and it came to $42.50. Taco Bell is much better.
