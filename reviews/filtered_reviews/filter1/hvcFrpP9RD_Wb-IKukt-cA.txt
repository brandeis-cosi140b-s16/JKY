We had an abominable experience here and, although very close to home for us, vowed to never go back. Took my wife, two daughters, two grandchildren for a 'special' time. We have had decent food and service at this restaurant in the past. I was stuck with a 'tilty' table the entire time. Apparently it is rocket science to address this. The service was delivered as if there was a huge drug party going on in the back. No concept of getting orders out in any sensible order or entrees at the same time. Then there was the food quality. I know good food and I know bad and mediocre food. I seldom leave most of the served food on my plate. I did with this meal. Two of the other adults in our group also were not happy with what they were served. I made our dissatisfaction known to the waiter and basically they don't care. The food is pricey and the drinks are nothing special either. Just get the margarita mix at Costco and essentially you have the same thing. Surprisingly, this restaurant gets a lot of rave reviews. If you want a good Mexican meal with a Southwestern twist, try the Blue Agave.
