So today me and a friend decided to go out to eat at around 5:30 ish so he suggested to go to Los Olivos and I was like sure lets give it a try once we got there we were greeted by the guy up front he asked us where we wanted to sit so we said anywhere is fine,one of his servers was nearby and he asked him if he could seat us and serve us and he said "I GUESS" could've been more nice, we decided to start with some queso in the menu it had the option of either medium or large the server didn't even ask which we wanted he just brought out the large one,we were like ok it's cool,we looked over the menu some more until we decided to get some chimichangas the server suggested we add beans and rice without even saying it was an extra charge,we asked for a side of sour cream instead we received a huge spoonful of sour cream on top of our chimichanga,the rice was dry and had no flavor the beans were really really dry and the lettuce that came with the plate was hot and looked really old,we got asked if we were okay ONCE the servers helper came to refill our drinks like 2 times without even asking if we wanted a refill and when he came he didn't even talk after the server was done helping a huge group he came to drop off our check without even asking if we were done or if we wanted desert, we waited for 10 minutes and he never came back to pick up our cards to pay for the bill so we decided to get up and start walking out until we saw the greater in the door,we asked who we were supposed to give our cards too and he said I guess I can take care of it, when he charged us we asked if we could split the tab and he responded with I don't know if I can do that,he eventually figured out how to do it.
          The food is really bad the service is bad the employees are walking around with shorts, and earrings on and tattoos I don't have anything against that it's just that I don't feel like they should work like that, the only reason they got a 1 star is because their lemonade was good, never going back again
