Wow lets talk about poor service. So the reviews looked pretty positive so a friend and I went here on vDay (today) we called to put our name on the list for 8, got there at 7.30, got seated at 9.20, only because we saw the girl who first wrote down our name.

It kind of got to be a game, each person would ask where they were on the list and all the girl would say is 'yah, just a few' or 'just a little bit' without even finding their names. Not a place that is used to packed crowds.

Now lets talk about the veggie burrito I got which was just filled with zucchini, 3 small pieces of onion and two slivers of carrots. No, doesn't pass for anything. 

No beans or cheese, or anything fun like that in it. Oh well, lesson learned. You guys can keep this one for yourself. Wont be going back.
