A coworker had prompted me to try this chain telling me how great it was so I had to give it a shot. i quickly glanced at the menu board and decided to go with barbacoa. i looked over the partition to view the other add ins and noticed that the shredded chicken in another container was swimming in a thick film of red oil and the meat looked "plastic" like and not natural. 

I should of walked out at that point but for some reason, decided to ignore that and was compelled to move on. I added black beans, rice, guacamole, medium spice sauce, lettuce, and pico de gallo. 

The burrito was very big, maybe slightly bigger than Chipotle or Zabas. it went down hill from there. I got home and my burrito was sitting in a lot of liquid. Probably from the pico de gallo not having been drained well. The tortilla was soggy and worse was, the pork was so sweet, it was like biting in a bbq pulled pork burrito. Dont get me wrong, I love pulled pork but i was just not expecting my barbacoa burrito meat to taste like that. It was just an unpleasant surprise and really turned me off to this place. Back to Zabas and Qdoba I go.
