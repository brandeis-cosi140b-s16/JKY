This food sucked, it really wasn't all that. Read people that's all I'm saying. Read all the reviews. There saying the same thing. Bad service with bad food equals bad reviews. Not by far my fav place for Mexican food. Roberto's kills this place, on a bad day. Listen and read. Don't come here with high expectations. There are none here...........
