Had been a Distrito regular and loved the fun, kitschy, and vibrant Mexican theme. Just came in today and found out they were having a soft opening to reveal their new remodel.  

The whole place has been muted down with brown paint and heavy furniture. Gone are the wall of calaveras, day of the dead figurines, and Hecho en Mexico server uniforms. The theme has totally been erased. No longer fits with the brightness of the Saguaro. :(

All of the servers are new, wearing all black, and need help with pronouncing the double L sound! 

The menu has some remnants of its former self, but much has changed. The food is still good, but the ambiance leaves much to be desired. 

We won't be back. Sticking to the Clarendon Hotel and El Gallo Blanco for festive fun and amazing tacos.
