If I could give zero stars I would!!! I heard nothing but negative thing about wahoo's but some friends wanted to grab a drink during lunch. We walked into the bar about 1230.  Sat there for about 10+ minutes and never saw a bartender. The GM even passed through the bar and said "hey guys". Waited another 5 minutes..... Nothing...... we asked another patron at the bar if there was a bartender. They said yes. It's a sorry excuse of a bar when a customer has to go hunt down the bartender. We finally just left.  Thanks for wasting our time. We just went to BJs down the street.  I will never return and I recommend you don't even try this bar. Obviously they don't care.
