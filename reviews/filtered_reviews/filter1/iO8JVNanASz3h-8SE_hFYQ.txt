They claim to have borracho beans but they are actually refried beans with no flavor. The Spanish rice is horrible. Very dry and no flavor. The staff is friendly but management is rude disrespectful.

The General Manager was not friendly and kept starring and giving us smirks as she walked by. I am in the restaurant business and that is no way to treat your customers. I will never return.
