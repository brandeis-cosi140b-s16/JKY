I was so happy when I noticed that they had a new location open up in the Tempe area.  I had watched Man vs. Food and Adam (the host) usually goes to decent spots, so I decided to give it a try.  Now I LOVE Mexican food and I'm a fan of authentic Mexican food.  I tried the Del Rey Torta and it was the most HORRIBLE Torta that I have ever experienced in my life.  The hot dogs were undercooked, the pork had fat on it, the beef and chicken looked like dog food and they had the nerve to add Ruffle chips on the side.  I have never eaten and will NEVER eat at this restaurant again. The manager did not know English so one of the waitresses had to translate for him.  Not good!  How do you plan on dealing with the public in America and don't know or understand English.  The ONLY reason why I gave it 1 star is because the manager gave me my money back.
