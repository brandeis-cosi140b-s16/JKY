This was my first & last time going here. I went there around 9:30 (they close at 10) Not only did they seem upset my daughter and I came in they managed to mess up everything on the order to where they had to make it again. They were to busy chatting with their friends at the table behind me while I was ordering. The store was disgusting and near the soda machine you couldn't even set your cup down to put a lid on it, as the whole counter was wet with who knows what! Stay away from this location!
