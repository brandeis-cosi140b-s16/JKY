The hostesses/wait staff were prompt and cheerful. The decor and atmosphere is kitschy, reminiscent of The Islands chain. However, the food was terrible and expensive. We had the quesadillas which we had to cut with steak knives - no kidding, and I had the veggie tacos which were insubstantial and no seasonings whatsoever. I could have made the tacos at home in 5 minutes for 50 cents rather than 6.99.
