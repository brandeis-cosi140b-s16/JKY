What a total DOWNER. We were so disappointed in the entire staff and experience at Senor Frog's! This was our first stop of the night as we were staying at the T.I. We went to the bar area, which is a 'Seat Yourself' area. This turned into the realization that there is no service in this area even at tables. We were informed of this by waitstaff that clearly did not want to provide any service. Ugh! We then moved from a table to the bar as you need to order at the bar anyway to take your own drinks back to your table. At the bar, we were our usual happy selves, and let me at this time reiterate, we were on vacation---in a wonderful mood---and without a budget!!! Perfect Customers with money to spend!!! The bartenders and barstaff were absolutely against us...I have never experienced such a poor attitude at any establishment. They did not want to make any drinks we requested and made excuses for not providing what we asked for. After being provided NOTHING by the bartenders, we left....sad and absolutely dejected. What a Vegas bummer the whole experience was.  Friends, avoid this place like the plague!
