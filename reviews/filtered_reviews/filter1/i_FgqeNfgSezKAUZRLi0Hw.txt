The place is filthy, indoors and out. The drinks are subpar. The food...uh, don't know, we ordered a chicken quesadilla and 40minutes later, asked about it, she said it's coming, 15more minutes and still nothing. Shoot, I could have driven home, made one myself, eaten it and been back in that amount of time! 

Smoking at the end of the patio which does not contain the smoke. Also, people just stand around outside the patio rail smoking and looking at the TVs. The whole experience was bad, bad, bad. 

Suppose it's all right if your 20-something, looking to get cheap drinks and be seen in Old Town. 

Oh, not to mention they had a tiki on the 'hostess' stand wearing a sombrero! A sombrero! Tikis are not Mexican! You'll anger the tiki gods by dressing them in a sombrero!
