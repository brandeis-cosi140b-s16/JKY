I love tacos and I love trying out different restaurants that serve them.  My husband and I went to Barrio Queen yesterday afternoon for lunch.  We both left very disappointed and hungry.   First we tried the El Rey Vasito de Elote which we were anxious to try since we've had this dish before in another restaurant.  This dish came out in a smallish cup and it was served with nothing, no chips.  I guess we were supposed to eat this with a spoon like some kind of corn pudding.  This dish has always been served with chips at other places, why not at the Barrio Queen?  Must say, it really wasn't that good and we didn't finish it.  We both ordered tacos and they were just ok.  Such a rip off these small 3 bite street tacos.  These tacos were served with 2 salsas...if you can call these 2 small containers of the most watered down "salsa" I've ever seen, and absolutely no taste, no chunks of tomatoes, peppers, nothing.  I find it funny the runner who brought out the salsa warned the red was spicy. 
This place will be a hit with tourists since it's in a prime location.  The tourists can have this place, we will never be back.
