Very disappointed In today's outing . I asked our server Jadyn what was in the veggie burrito, she really didn't know , her answer was 'all veggies ! 'I asked her if it was green peppers , onions , she said yes , I told her apparently what was in it,  When it was delivered it was a bean and cheese , I didn't want that cause I already ordered beans and rice on side . I asked her again where is the veggies in my burrito , I had it cut it half, she looked at it,she said they should be there , looked at it again, said she would ask about the veggies,and added I odered you a veggie  burrito ,at that point she walked away , nothing to help the situation, just walked away . Then came back and asked if I needed a Togo box ? I wasn't eating it .Not really sure what that customer service was , but she didn't have it today , my son even said she was acting like she was out of it , he's 15 and notice . She came back dropped off our check , still no sorry , I'll take it off your bill , can I get you a new one , nothing , charged me and she was done .again very disappointed with this place today , that's why a 1 star, my son did get what he wanted , that's the star.
