Its not often I write a review. Its either really good, or really bad. Unfortunately, I feel I have to tip the ridiculous 4.5 star rating negatively. You don't always find such a high rating with a 100 reviews but really? How can anybody like this? I grew up in AZ and CA my entire life. Ive never had worse Mexican food EVER. Absolutely disgusting. I spit out the carne asada taco I was eating, it actually made me cringe. Its was HORRIBLE.
