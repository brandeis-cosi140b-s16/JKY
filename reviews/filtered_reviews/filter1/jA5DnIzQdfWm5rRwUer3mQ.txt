Well let me start with if I could give this place a 0 I would. We were in Las Vegas yesterday our last night there and we decided to stop here for some food and drinks about 10ish. So it took 10 minutes to even get acknowledged by someone then when the hostess finally seated us we sat there for over 20 minutes waiting for a waitress to take our order didn't show up. I had to ask another waitress from the inside if she knew who our waitress was first fail. 2nd fail I ordered guacamole with pork rinds well took 15 minutes to get and they bring me chips and guacamole. After I told the waitress she began to tell me how pork rinds were not available at late night yet on the late night menu its stated on there. I was really upset why offer something then tell me no we don't.  I had 2 different waitress try to tell me this. So eventually a manager got involved an got me some but not even home made pork rinds food wasnt even worth it and the drinks that took over 30 minutes to get to us. Worst part the table next to us got their drinks and food about 10 minutes before us and they arrived bout 15 minutes after us. Horrible service overall and crappy food.
