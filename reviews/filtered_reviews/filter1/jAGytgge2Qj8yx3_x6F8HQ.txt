Just don't go.  You may think it's a good idea, but it's bad.  

I took my fianc√©, mother and soon to be mother-in-law for dinner. I picked this restaurant as we were staying close in Greentree and wanted something good, but close and fairly fast.  Based on all the prior great reviews, I chose Casa Rasta. 

First, it is a very small restaurant with maybe 10 tables and a bar.  We had no reservations and there was not a table for the 4 of us.  We sat at the bar, at least the bar stools were comfy, because we were there for almost 2 hours.  

We ordered spicy black bean dip and some salsa.  Our salsa came out quickly and then 30 minutes later our black bean dip arrived.  The dip was delicious.  It had great flavor although the chips tasted stale.  

We then WAITED FOR 1 MORE HOUR AFTER COMPLETING OUR APPETIZERS FOR OUR MAIN COURSE.  We had two salads, a quesadilla, 4 steak tacos and 3 fish tacos with a side of black beans.  I could have gone to the store and made something better in less time.  Besides the salad, which was delicious, everything else was not appetizing at all.  The steak tacos were this weird breaded steak without ANY flavor, luke warm and just bad. The fish tacos were not a crisp fried breading as you were lead to believe.  Rather they tasted as they had been sitting out or someone put them in the microwave. 

Maybe if we had only waited 20 minutes for this mediocre food, I wouldn't be giving this such a poor rating.  However, the service was horrendous too!  Our waitress said when asked about the long wait, "yeah, there are lots of orders." with a sorry, too bad attitude.  There was no manager/owner or anyone available to care.  No offering for comp'ed appetizers.
