By far the worst Mexican food I've ever had.  Not much flavor, runny beans, gross appearance and taste.  I won't go back.  Wondering how it's stayed in business for so long.  There are many other Mexican restaurants in town.  Try them instead of this one!!

Best Mexican the Canadians have ever had, maybe.

One word review. Yuck?
