Wahoos fish taco's restaurant may be appealing to the human eyes, due to the beachy decorations and atmosphere. I must say that the fish were very soggy and tasted like a mop. Parts of the fish were undercooked, thank god I made the choice to hault my mouth from reaching the food. I don't trust those animals with my food. I have realized that the fish may not even be real. It had a fake taste to it and has a weird texture. I think it is safe to say I will never eat there again :) have a food day.
