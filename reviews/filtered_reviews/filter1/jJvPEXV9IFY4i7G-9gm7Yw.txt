This is my first review on Yelp, and decided this to be my first because I feel I wasted a lot of money by reading the other reviews for this restaurant and going there for lunch with my family while vacationing in Scottsdale.  We were looking for good Mexican food and read the reviews on Yelp for La Fonda Del Sol. We went there for lunch yesterday.  My Chimichanga was doughy, and tamale was like cake - very airy masa.  Very unfriendly woman delivered chips and salsa to the table, waiter was very hurried - even though there were very few people in the restaurant - and bathroom was filthy.  You can get better food and service elsewhere.  Do not waste your time and money.
