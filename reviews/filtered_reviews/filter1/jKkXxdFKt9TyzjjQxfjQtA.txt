Don't waste your time or your money. Go to Chipotle for fresher, better-tasting food for a whole lot less money.  Or Del Taco. Or Hot Dog on a Stick for that matter. This restaurant was overpriced and a HUGE disappointment. 

Chips were ok, as noted by a previous reviewer, and the salsa was "meh".  I had the pork carnitas tacos, plate comes with rice and refried black beans.  Most of the pork was OK, but had to pick out a decent amount of charred crispy and fatty bits. Rice was totally undercooked, no flavor.  Black beans had ZERO flavor. No joke, like zip zilch zero flavor. My date had the Alambre taco plate, with same bland rice and beans. He claims his tacos were "ok, not bad".  

Our drinks weren't any better. I had the lemon drop margarita, date had the mojito. Neither drink got drank completely. Mine was so sour and  undrinkable, I wondered if it was made with a gone-bad batch of sour mix by a rookie who's first shift on the job was that night (any of you bartenders out there know what I'm talking about).  Mojito was average. 

If you find yourself staying at the Luxor, it's your first night in Vegas, you're starving and ready for a good cocktail, DO NOT GO HERE. Keep walking. Act like you don't even see it.  Spare yourself the frustrations of a severely sub-par meal at what we've now renamed "Taints & Tequila" and go grab a slice and a Coke at NYNY.  Then hit the main lobby bar just down the escalator for some well-poured totties. Cheers!  (But seriously, don't go here. It's superbly not good).
