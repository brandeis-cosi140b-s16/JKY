We dined last night. When we entered we asked the hostess for a table on the patio by a heat lamp. She said that would be no problem. We get out to the patio and all the heat lamps are bundled together and off. I see her tinker with one and then walk away. A few minutes later our server approached our table and took our drink orders. We mentioned the heat lamps and he said the owner was probably fixing them for us. (We had two kids with us who were freezing). Just as our drinks arrived another table was sat. The hostess/owner came back out to the patio and started to fix the heat lamps by the NEW table. We ordered our food and said if we could not get a heat lamp we would like to move inside. For the next 15 minutes the owner set up and got working two heat lamps for the new table. Once our food arrived she came over and started on ours. I felt like a second rate citizen. We mentioned that it was cold and she said it was because we were drinking margarita's. I said the kids were not drinking margaritas and their hands were freezing she said they should have gotten up and warmed them by the fire pit. With this kind of hospitality from the OWNER I won't need to ever dine here again.
