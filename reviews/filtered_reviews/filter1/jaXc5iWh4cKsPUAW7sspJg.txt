Tried for happy hour.   Horrible horrible service.    Acted like we were bothering them by being there.    Waiter did not explain happy hour pricing even when ask.    It was really kinda ridiculous.    Margaritas were cheap and good for the price.   2 dollars.   Chips and salsa good.   Everything else we ordered was not.    Tasted like freezer section Mexican food that then microwaved.    Will never come back.
