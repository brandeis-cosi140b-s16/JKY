I was visting Tempe for the art festival last weekend and stopped by El Jefe for tacos and a drink. They had a lot of TVs and bartender was very nice. I noticed their very large advertisements for NFL Football and so i decided I would comeback on Sunday night to watch my Chargers play the patriots for SUNDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL.

Once I arrived Sunday Night, my friend and I ordered food and drink and noticed none of the TVs were on NBC, so around 5 minutes before game time I asked the waitress to change the channel to SUNDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL and she said "no problem". 15 minutes later (10 minutes into the game) the Tv still hadn't changed and the waitress returned. She said the manager had left and they weren't allowed to operate the remote! She then said "the TVs are staying where they are...". Note, I had already placed food order and this was a very big game. The food was so so. My friend and I had to scarf down our meal and go across the street where the game was on every TV. I do not blame the waitress but don't have giant NFL advertisements on every other tv and not show NFL Football unless you are wiling to hire people competent enough to operate a tv controller. I mean it's a sports bar right? Decent place to hang out.... Unless you are trying to watch football. Figure it out
