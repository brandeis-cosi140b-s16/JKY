El Dorado, the city of gold and the restaurant of filth. That's great your food is organic an gmo free but it still tastes like shit I've had better Mexican food out of a can, the service is terrible, the beer is flat and the bartenders suck, and how are you gonna charge $15 for guac are you fucking serious get outta here, also they don't wash their glasses, if your gonna eat there bring your own silverware (byos) or just save yourself the $50 dollars and go to Taco Y Taco and get some real street corn and tacos for less that taste better.. The only reason this place has good Yelp reviews is because they bribe people with free desert for a good review..
