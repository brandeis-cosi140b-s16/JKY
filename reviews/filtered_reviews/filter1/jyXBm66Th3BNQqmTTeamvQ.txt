Drink here...then you may be able to palette the food. 

Cool atmosphere had us excited that we were about to taste something different. And we did! 

Just not in a good way.

We ordered the Dungeness Crab Ceviche ($15) "Dungeness Crab, watermelon, olive, mint, citrus" and it was ALL watermelon chunks with small bits of crab clinging to it. The watermelon was not ripe, slightly slimy and the hint of crab just added a fish hint to it. The waitress tried to explain that that is how this seasonal ceviche is served...mostly watermelon, and the others were like a typical ceviche (I guess meaning there is actually more than a tablespoon of fish used) yet they are all described the same way on the menu. 

Also ordered was the lentil salad. Zucchini, sweet potato, red and green onion and cilantro vin. What I got was a pile of cold, TASTELESS lentils. Urgh.

When I got up within minutes to get the check and told the waitress it was all horrible she tried to convince us to try something else. We were, of course, totally over Taco Haus at this point and just wanted out. She had heard my son say he wanted cake, so she did get us a piece to go, but as for the bill.....She CHARGED US for all the other food we had only taken a bite of! Wow. That better be one damn good piece of $30 "complimentary" cake. 

I think I need a drink to dull the memory of Taco Haus....but I won't be back there to get it.
