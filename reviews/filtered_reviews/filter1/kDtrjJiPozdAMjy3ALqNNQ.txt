We had a near two hour experience in a restaurant that was half full. The service was horrible, starting with the "just water right" response from the waitress, even before we sat down.

Our food, which took over an hour to get to us, with no real apology, was given to us, one at a time. Best part, the table beside us ordered what I did, the dry as all hell chicken fajitas, for theirs first before me! My wife was pretty much done with her food even before mine and I had to wait over five minutes, after I received my food, to get shells for the fajitas.

To make it simple the food is over priced, small portions, horrible service, and just not very good. We paid $30 and it was not worth it at all! You are better off going to Taco Bell for Mexican food.
