WAY too expensive for what they serve (I know it's Vegas, and everything is jacked up, but come ON) and pretty lousy service.

Got a buffalo club sandwich (wasn't feeling the Mexican here) and it was ok, nice spice but nothing too heavy, and nice well-done fries, but $16?  Got a mini-cup of ketchup, asked twice for more and never got it.

Free margarita on the rocks coupons (market price 11 f-ing dollars for something smaller than Webster's trouser snake) but the waitress salted the rims when we asked for unsalted.

Chicken tacos thoroughly drenched in cheese, and tasted like a chicken sandwich, nothing great.

I'd avoid this like the plague.  There's a hell of a lot better in Vegas, even on the Strip.  I guess they gotta pay the rent for having the sidewalk-cafe vibe.
