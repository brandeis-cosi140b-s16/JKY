We strolled in to Senor Frogs for lunch the day after the Super  Bowl thinking we were going to have good food and a good time. Boy, were we wrong.  The server Robert was lifeless and rude.  Our food came out with , wrong sides, one plate came out with chicken when we ordered beef etc.  Robert the server at the end of the meal was more interested in how much tip he was going to get than how the customer service was.   All in all, OK food, but toooo pricey for what it is, and really bad customer service.  Will never be back to this place again.
