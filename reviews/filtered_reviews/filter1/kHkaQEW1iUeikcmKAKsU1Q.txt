If I could give a negative star I would. My friends and I used to come here a while ago and it was really fun. Service tonight sucked. Alejandra (the waitress) doesn't know how to do basic math. She sucks. We wanted to do separate checks and she couldn't do that. It took her about 15 minutes to run our cards and that's with my help. She wanted to charge $13 for 2 waters, are you kidding me?!!!! Food was ok, nothing special. Music was good, DJ was nice. Bad service, yet we were force to tip. We decided to never come back and we are going to make sure none of friends  one either!
