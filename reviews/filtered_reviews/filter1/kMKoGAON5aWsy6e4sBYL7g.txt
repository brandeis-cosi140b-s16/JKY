Went here for happy hour one night. Good luck trying to get a seat at the bar which you have to be at in order to get the happy hour prices. The tacos were good and reasonably priced but the drinks were way over priced even on happy hour. It's an older crowd with mostly Cougars on the prowl. Shame because I really wanted to love this place but we won't be back.
