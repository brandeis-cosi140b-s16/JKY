I'm not going to waste my time and write a five page review about this stupid place!
1- Food was extremely over priced.  $12 for a bowl of black beans and rice!!
2- We found an Ant in our plate.... WTF!!
3- The dinning room was too hot like it felt warmer than out side. No A/C I guess!!
4- The cashier kid (a little punk who wears a baseball hat - for your reference!) was hitting on my wife!! WTF!! 
5- Too loud... you cant even hear anything.


Don't waste your time or your money. There are way better Mexican places in town.
