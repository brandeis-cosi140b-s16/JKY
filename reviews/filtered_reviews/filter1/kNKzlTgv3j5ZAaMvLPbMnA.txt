This is a drinks only place. The food is extremely low quality and it is not good. Chicken tacos were two tiny tiny tiny pieces of dark meat with a big wad of shredded lettuce and a few bits of tomatoes on top. No sauce, no flavor, nothing. The shrimp skewers were $7 for 3 skewers and from the way it sounds there may be a few shrimp on each one. Nope, just one small shrimp on each. Not quality food, not quality chefs.
