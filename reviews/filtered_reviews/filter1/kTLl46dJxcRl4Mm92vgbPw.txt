Usually Mexican food served out of an outdated building with numerous building code violations is always the best. Not so much in the case of Carolina's. I arrived on a Saturday about 11 am to a short line and I had heard from one longtime Phoenix resident that this is the real deal. I had to try the famous tortillas right? So, I ordered up a cheese quesadilla and a red machaca burrito. How does it end up that Arizona and Nevada have completly different ideas of what machaca is. It is supposed to be dry beef grilled with onions, peppers, tomatoes and eggs. But in Phoenix, it is basically shredded wet beef doused in red or green sauce. Regardless, the Carolina's version was miserable. It was mushy and tasteless and since the thin tortillas could not hold all that beef inside, it turned into a knife and fork thing. I barely ate three bites of the mess and some fat was also discovered lurking in that meat.  Not good.
Same thing with the quesadilla. Due to the tortilla being so thin, the cheese overwhelmed the item turning it into a cheese wafer. If I want Machaca, I'm heading back to Nevada next time to a state that knows the true definition of the dish.
