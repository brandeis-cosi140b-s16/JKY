Horrible! Very expensive for NOTHING! Greasy gross food. Dirty restaurant. Yuck! Even the guy taking orders CLEARLY didn't want to be there. First he had to hang up from his personal call on his cell phone to take our order. Then our food sat in the window until I walked up and he quit texting and noticed it was sitting there. We all ended up with a stomach ache. We will never go back and would steer anyone clear of there!!
