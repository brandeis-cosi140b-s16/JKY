This is one of my least favorite places in all of Phoenix. I'll grant you that I'm more than a little biased against 'clubs' in general (I'd rather relax, talk, and laugh than get bumped around, shout, and pay $15 for a whiskey after waiting in line for 15 minutes). 

That being said, this place is the worst of the worst as far as clientele goes. Every Phoenician has heard of the $35K / year Scottsdale millionaire. Well, this is where they all come on Friday and Saturday nights to take on more crushing credit card debt so they can pop some bottles and impress some trashy women. 

Are you a male in your twenties that likes cranberry mixers, works in 'finance' (read: entry level teller at Chase), leases a 328i, is not above slipping something in a girl's drink, and pretends to be some kind of pseudo-cowboy hardass at Country Thunder once a year? Then you'll love it here among your friends.

Are you a woman that is attracted to the aforementioned Scottsdale Bro? You'll love it here as well.
