Stuck in the Vegas airport for a layover and was hoping to grab a bite to eat. Made the mistake of choosing this place (although there really isn't much of a choice at the airport). Ordered the Blue Burrito. Although it wasn't the worst Mexican food I've ever had, it would probably rank second worst. Really salty chicken with no other spice to it. The Pico de Gallo was OK, but that's the only thing on the plate that was tolerable.

I probably would have had a better meal if I squeezed some ketchup packets on napkins and ate that instead.
