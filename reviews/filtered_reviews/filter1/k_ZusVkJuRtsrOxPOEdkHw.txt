Food was good as always,  but the customer service was crap. The happy hour posted every where is not valid anywhere other than the bar upstairs. I got no discount on the appetizer after seeing multiple signs stating half price appetizers and drinks. A bill for almost $60.00, for poor customer service, and on top of it all I was practically sharing my chips and salsa with the pigeons.  I will not be back. Check your bill if you choose to eat here, they are on the hustle ;)
