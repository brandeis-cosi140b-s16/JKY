They called & CANCELLED my reservation 10 minutes before we were scheduled to sit down. They were extremely unhelpful when I tried to see if there were other options (such as splitting up the group). This put out our whole group & we were left wandering around trying to find a place to eat on a Saturday night (good luck with that ..) I've never had someone cancel a reservation before .. if you can't take the group, then don't take the reservation.
