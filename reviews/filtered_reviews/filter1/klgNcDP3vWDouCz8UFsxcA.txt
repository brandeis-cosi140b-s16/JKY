I think I agree with a lot of the people that ate here - the veg food was not good.

In summary: ADD ANY AMOUNT OF SALT AND WAYYY LESS OIL!!!!

My boyfriend got the taco combo with 4 meat tacos. He said they were all good, but I'm not sure what he judges his food by. He's pretty easy to please when it comes to a meal, trust me. 

As for me, I ordered two veg tacos with different sauce and they were both a disaster. They were drowning in oil which ended up all soaking into the corn tortillas. The best I could do was try to pick out the veggies and tofu, let them drain before eating and then leave the tortillas for the trash. On top of that, the sauces they put on the tacos, while they sounded enticing, were everything but. They definitely needed salt (which wasn't provided on the table) and the flavors mentioned (ie: peanut) were not present in the sauce - just a spicy, sodium-lacking gravy with oil oozing everywhere. 

Yuck.
