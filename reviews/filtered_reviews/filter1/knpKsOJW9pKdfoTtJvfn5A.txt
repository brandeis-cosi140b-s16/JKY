Not to good! We started off there for happy hour. Even though they have a happy hour menu posted they would not honor it.
Instead they said they are going through menu changes. They pushed their taco specials and come to find out they are not very special. I ordered their lobster taco plater. The waiter seem to be training another gal and said the lobster is from Honduras and it's really good. When I received my lobster platter there was two tacos on it a 2 ounce cup of beans and the two ounce cup of rice. Once I started eating the tacos I found out there was more better than lobster they should change the name to battered lobster tacos with a hint of lobster. My Wife ordered the mahi tacos and was pretty much just as disappointed as the lobster platter. Before we got our taco platters we ordered shrimp ceviche tostadas they came out and we were surprised to find that one medium-sized shrimp was split into pieces of about a quarter inch that were divided over the to toast autos and were piled high with lettuce. They should change the name of the shrimp ceviche tostadas to a lettuce ceviche tostada because paying nine bucks for something like that is a bit ridiculous. And now we got the bill we had a couple of beers each the lobster special and the taco special that they put on it was 16 bucks each. So our bill came to 60 bucks when the waiter was pushing the taco platter is on us  as it was Taco Tuesday so buy one get one half off we had to point that out to them and get our bill adjusted.  We are taco connoisseurs and this place is for amateurs. If you want a good taco go to Julia's on Warner and Country Club. SoCal tacos in Gilbert so long we  won't be back. We'll be surprised if you're open another year. Nothing happy about their happy hour.
