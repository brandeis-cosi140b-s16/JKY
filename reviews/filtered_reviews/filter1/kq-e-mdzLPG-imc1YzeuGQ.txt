I took my Lab for lunch on the patio.   I had asked last year shortly after the patio was completed if it was OK and was told no problem.    Well when I showed today,  I was questioned if my dog was a service dog??  I said well she is today jokingly.   I was asked for my papers.   I was told that they had not taken the time to fill out the paper work for the pet friendly patio.   but it was OK this time since I was the only one on the patio at 3pm in the afternoon.    Make up your mind.   Either do it or not.   finished 1/2 my beer and lunch and left.  Not worth the hassle.  
The food was good as usual.
