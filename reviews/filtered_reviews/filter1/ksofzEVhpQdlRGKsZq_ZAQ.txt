FOOD WAS HORRIBLE. I have never had to spit food out at the table before. I ordered the beef cheek taco, the duck taco, and the fish taco. They were all mushy, flavorless and the beef cheek looked like someone #2'd on my plate. I will definitely say it is the chef and not the ingredients. The Carne Asada my husband had in his taco was rare. All 3 of their salsas were bland and pretty tasteless and had no HEAT.  All around a bad dining experience... BUT the drinks are decent and so is the atmosphere, you just may want to go somewhere else for food. I wont be back
