The Saguaro Hotel turned out to be a hidden gem.  The holiday weekend was chock full of pool parties and fun.  The staff was excellent all the way down to the cleaning crew.  Distrito on the other hand was the one sore spot.  We only ate there once on Sunday morning right between the breakfast and lunch turn at 11.  We were one of 2 tables seated in the empty place.  The food was barely passable and after 45 minutes of waiting around, we finally asked Waitress #2 if waitress #1 could bring us our check (as we hadn't seen her in the empty restaurant for over 20 minutes).  When she came out with the bill she had the nerve to jokingly say that she'd forgotten she had a table to serve. OMFG! One table and you forget about it.

Distrito should change the name to Distraughto.
