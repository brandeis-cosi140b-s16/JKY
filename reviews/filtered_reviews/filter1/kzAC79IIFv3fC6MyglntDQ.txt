We were asked to leave for being too loud. Our waiter Gaybriel had attitude from the start. We were on the patio by ourselves watching football and when I asked the manager Suzette her reasoning she explained that an elderly couple said we were loud when we walked in. Huh? Well the Cardinals had just spanked the 49ers so we were pumped. Wow what a bunch of crap for a place we have been going to for over 20 years and a total lack of respect. There were seven of us all long time customers and couldn't believe it. We even know the owner and asked him to review the video but he stated that "maybe we should just part ways". Popo's service has been going downhill anyway for some time but we just felt dedicated to the place and had a lot of good times there. We will take our business to Mixteca for a much better experience. Sorry Mario but your business practices just aren't up to snuff anymore.
