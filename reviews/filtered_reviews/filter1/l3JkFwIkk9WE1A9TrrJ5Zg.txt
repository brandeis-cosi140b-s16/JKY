I worked in Mexican restaurants for 12 years, and have eaten in them for 40.  Yuck!!  The server was nice, and enthusiastic about the food.  I ordered the El Diablo burrito with pork, or something like that - called out as really spicy on the menu.  It was a giant, open ended burrito with sauce that looked suspiciously identical to the salsa served with the chips.  I asked the waitress and she said, "yes, it is, but it's better because it's like, baked on there".  The inside had a good amount of day old dried pork chunks, with clumps of uncooked green onions finely chopped, along with raw cilantro in clumps.  It was disgusting, I felt sick for 3 days, and only had two bites!  My sister had a spinach enchilada and relleno plate.  The relleno was soggy, and by the time she got to the spinach enchilada, the lime green colored sauce on top was congealed.  She took one bite and pushed it away.

Will not go back!
