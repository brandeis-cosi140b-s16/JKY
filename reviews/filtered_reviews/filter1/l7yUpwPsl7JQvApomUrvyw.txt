Will never go back. And I love Wahoos food! Went in at 11:30am on July 26th. We sat in the lobby and waited for to-go food (2 burritos). There were literally 4 people in the restaurant. The cashier was very nice and kept apologizing for it taking so long. But 45 minutes later- still no food. That's how long for take out?.. Awful. Will never go back. I go to the wahoos in Boca Park all the time and they are great! This location needs serious help.
