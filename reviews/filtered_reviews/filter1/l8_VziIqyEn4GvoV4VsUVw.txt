If you've ever eaten good Mexican food in your life you would know this place is NOT the spot. I have no idea how it's the highest rated option on yelp.

1 burrito, 2 tacos, & a drink costs $19.73. That's already a no. Then you're like... okay it's Vegas, of course it'll cost a little more, whatever. 5 minutes later, you get your food and it tastes like nothing. Nothing.

I'm from LA so I have decent expectations for Mexican food and this was almost disrespectful. No flavor and the meat was cold. The watermelon drink was good.

Bottom line: this place is one very small step above Taco Bell. If you're from LA or SD, any taco truck you might go to is better than this.
