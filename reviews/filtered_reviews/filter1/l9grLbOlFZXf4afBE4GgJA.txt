I have heard such great things, but the actual event was so lack luster. It look an hour to get our order, I won't even mention how long it took for the waitress to take our order. The place wasn't even half full so I would hate to see if when they are busy. 
When the food came out, half the orders were wrong. The portions were odd and very light on any meat. The salas were both too spicy to be eaten with the chips which I think were three days old.
NEVER AGAIN
