I would not recommend this place to anyone and I do not plan on ever going back to this restaurant.

1) The service was horrible and slow. We had a server that could not handle simple requests and took forever with the basics like salsa, chips and drinks. The server would leave for several minutes without returning to refill or take orders on drinks. In addition, the waiter did instant gratuity on a 5 person table. Nice to know that when you do a bad job you can still take a tip.

2) The food was sub par. The steak fajitas I ordered were watery and lacked flavor. Other people in my group felt the same about their entrees. However, the queso dip was descent. 

3) The atmosphere was nice and the place has a lot of potential. I really like the bicycle artwork but it was probably from the bar next door called "Kickstand". 

Again, I would not recommend this place. I was about to give it two stars but I really can't get past the bad customer experience and sub par food. In my line of work bad customer experience is unacceptable. This is as simple as correct orders, refilling drinks and not taking thirty minutes to handle processing receipts.
