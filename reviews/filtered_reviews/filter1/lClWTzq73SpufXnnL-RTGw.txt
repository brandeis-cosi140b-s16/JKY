After hearing good things from a friend that's addicted to this place, I finally went. Was late on a Sunday so not many people... so you would think asking a question or two wouldn't be a problem. The girls behind the counter were clearly hating life and were abrupt. Chicken, steak or pork and corn or flour were my options. I opted for pork...which I had heard was their specialty. Sweet pork sounded interesting so why not? Right...? Literally the nastiest crap I've ever tasted. Spent $14 on 3 tacos and 2 drinks which is a tad upsetting when you realize the food is so sickeningly sweet you can't even eat it. I managed to douse it with hot sauce so much that it almost canceled the sweetness out but we ended up drawing straws to see who had to eat the last taco and then decided to just throw it away. Over priced nasty food and people that work there don't want to help you. Will stick to Chipolte or pretty much any other place.
