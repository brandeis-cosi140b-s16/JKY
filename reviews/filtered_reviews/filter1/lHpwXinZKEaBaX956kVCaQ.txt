Bad! This place does not look like a Mexican restaurant (but that is not the problem) and the food does not taste like Mexican food. The food actually was not tasting good. The menu had just a few options. You should do not trust in a Mexican restaurant where you don't see any Mexican guy inside. They know where there is an authentic food from their country.
