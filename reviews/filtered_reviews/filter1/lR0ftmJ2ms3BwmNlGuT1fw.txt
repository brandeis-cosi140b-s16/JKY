This place has the worst service. The wait staff is extremely rude. At first our waitress said she could split our check and she split it wrong but said that she couldn't fix it. By the way, the food is awful.
The waitress pronounced the L's in quesadilla's and they didn't have jalape√±os. This is not Mexican food. It's mush food. 
Advice, starve or go to Burger King.
