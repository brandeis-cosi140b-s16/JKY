Met up with two friends here before we went to a pool. I was late so they had already ordered food before I had arrived. As I was looking at the menu, their food came and they both ordered some type of tacos, well both of their orders had hair right on the top of their food!!!! I understand this happens from time to time, but for it to happen on two entrees at the same table just really made me lose my appetite! They sent their food back, we paid for our drinks and went to eat at the pool. Even without the hair, the food looked barely edible to begin with. Definitely won't go back unless it's just for drinks.
