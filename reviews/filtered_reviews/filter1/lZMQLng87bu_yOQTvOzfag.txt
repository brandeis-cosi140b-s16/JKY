My mom and I just ate lunch there and I would never go back. We both live in the area and were excited to try it. The service was terrible. It took us forever to get our food and when it did come my pad thai was ok not great and my moms veggie torta was also mediocre. The main reason I will never go back is when we ordered desert our server verbally told us the menu and we ordered the cheesecake. When it came it was covered in peanuts after I specifically told the server I was allergic when I ordered the pad thai peanut free. I'm leaving on a flight and didn't have time for them to make me something else. So overall mediocre food and terrible service.
