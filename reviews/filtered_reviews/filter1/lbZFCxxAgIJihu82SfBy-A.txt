The ball & chain and I stopped by for the first time last week. The place has a nice set up and everything looks very nice inside. That's probably the best thing I can say. The waitress took about 15 minutes to take our order and then when she did she left for another 5 because she didn't have a pen. And the restaurant was only 3/4 full. We ordered some queso appetizer and it was decent but you get better stuff at Taco Bell. And the food portions are ridiculous. I'm a math nerd so I figured it out. The tacos are $4 each (yes $4 each, I know wtf, right!!) and being a big guy (I'm a toned 6'3 225 lbs beast) I can finish these tacos in 3 bites which comes out to $1.33 per bite. That's pathetic and you don't get full unless you order like 6 tacos if you are a big dude my size. The taste was less than good. I don't know why they get so many good reviews. The place is not good at all. Maybe it's because I have actually tried Mexican tacos in Mexico that I know what tacos should taste like. The service is pretty bad too. From the waitress to the bus boys. I guess they think they are better than what they are, but guess what? Get real because you work at a restaurant and you are not better than anyone. We are all the same and bus boys should not think they are better than you. Ok sorry my rant is over! Don't come here!!
