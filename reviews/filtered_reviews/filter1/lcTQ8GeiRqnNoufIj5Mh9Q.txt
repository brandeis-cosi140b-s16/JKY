I wish i could have rated the food, sadly i can not.  I wish i could have rated the drinks, sadly i can not.  We came in on a Monday afternoon at 1PM for the first and only time.  We were promptly seated inside, water and menus were delivered, and then we had no other contact with any employee until we decided to leave 20 minutes later.  This wasn't us sitting for 5 minutes and we were just impatient.  After receiving water and menus we waited for more than 20 minutes with no contact with any other employee before deciding to leave.  It was like all of the employees were avoiding any eye contact with us and contact in general on purpose, even after our water was gone.  Might have been okay if someone approached us to get drink orders, might have been fine if we had beer or chips or something.  We don't mind a long meal, but this was ridiculous.  There seemed to be adequate staff, didn't seem too busy, others were being served.
