Absolute worst experience we have ever had. If able to give a zero I would. The food was very good but the service from the waiter to the manager was absolutely horrible. We went in to celebrate my 40th birthday with 3 other couples. This was on a Sunday late night, so the restaurant was very slow. We had drinks, appetizers and out main meals. We were having a great time. The waiter was subpar with his service. We had to ask a lot for refills etc. We informed the waiter that it would be separated checks  and he said they can make it work.  He presents us with one bill and asked us to figure it out. Would not assist us with separate checks. This is a supposed 4 upscale restaurant in the Aria casino and they were treating us like we were high schoolers going to Denny's. No corporation or assisting us with the transaction. We were all ready to pay our bills but they will not break it down for us. We sat for over a half hour trying to figure out our portions then they told us they would only take one form of payment. It was awe full. I asked to speak with management abd they got very defensive. Ask to speak to casino host they would not guide us. Now it is 1:00 am and we are tired and still no assistance. Finally they allowed separate credit card payments but when they got to my husband we paid our bill and informed us that there was still over $40 owed on the bill. We have no idea who that balance that belonged to but when it was said and done we were stuck with the unpaid balance. We were there to celebrate my birthday and they made it a horrible experience. They were rude, condescending, they made me feel horrible and humiliated me with there disrespect. Word to the wise. They are very unprofessional unlike the Javier's in Newport Beach. Be ready to be pay what you did not eat.
