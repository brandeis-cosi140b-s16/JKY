We were starVING and the line for secret pizza was down the hall so we went in search for something else... We saw the take out window and figured it was worth a shot. Figured wrong. Many reviews on here point to the obvious OVERPRICED. I wouldnt have minded if it actually lived up to its price, I ordered the Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich. Silly me for expecting more than 3 bites for the $8.88 price tag. It wasn't good. It was so soupy it had sogged thru the bun and takeout box! it was salty and beyond messy. 


Fun fact: While waiting for our food right by the take out window, a girl projectile vomited all over their cute little lounge chairs. The hostesses (more than one!) didn't even turn their heads when it was happening, I had to wave them down to do something about it! Should have taken that as a bad omen.
