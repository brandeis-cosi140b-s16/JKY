DON'T EAT HERE.  I traveled to Scottsdale with a large group of friends, seven of us broke away from the group and went to Papi Chulo's, 24 hours later we were all VIOLENTLY ILL.  I had to take my fiance to the hospital because she was so sick.

I called the restaurant to inform them of what had happened.  They didn't seem concerned and told me they would "investigate" and call me back.  I called back four times in three weeks trying to get ahol of someone who would offer compensation or even a little sympathy.  Never got a legite response from their manager, just excuses.
 
Even before we got sick I wouldn't suggest this restaurant.  There are much better Mexican restaurants within a couple of miles.  

Don't go to Papi Chulo's unless you want to get FOOD POISONING.
