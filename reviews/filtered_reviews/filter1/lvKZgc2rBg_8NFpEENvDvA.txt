This place was highly recommended. Maybe it's impressive to non-Mexicans that are tired of paying exuberant prices at the casinos, but if you come here and it's busy, walk away! 

I have to hand it to the management, they really want to give the locals and visitors the authentic and chaotic atmosphere that you might experience in Tijuana. You also will need your tourist Spanish to understand the instructions given over the loud speaker. The process to order your food is ridiculous. Hopefully you know what you want and you are sticking to one type of meat, otherwise you'll be standing in multiple lines to complete your order. It took my husband an hour to order some tacos because we wanted adobada and carne asada. 

The situation was bad enough to require them to tag team, so one can start eating while the other one kept their place in line. "Stay alive, no matter what occurs!"

So was it worth the hype? No! Carne asada and lengua were chewy and stringy. The adobada had the best flavor, but not good enough to return and endure this chaos once again. Tacos el Gordo should be named Tacos el Tonto! Tontos for standing in line for mediocore tacos. Adios!!
