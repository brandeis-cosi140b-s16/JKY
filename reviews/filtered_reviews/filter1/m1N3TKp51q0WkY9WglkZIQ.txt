The craving for chips and salsa were stronger than the desire NOT to eat here based on Yelp reviews.  The  prices are inflated and the quality of food was, um, not good! It is a seat yourself and good luck with being acknowledged when you sit down.  Do not eat here unless you have greater than 1 hour to blow.  I saw a few people just having drinks.  I should have got the que and got the hell out.  I was so hungry and couldn't resist.  I will NOT be back.
