We had the pork and shrimp shui mai very fatty and oily Then had the steamed buns with bar b q pork .. No flavor, and gristly  ok now we try the shrimp mojo They had some flavor but you could pour off the oil into a cup , so gross.  The staff were very nice!  The prices are very high for the bad quality of food.  Do not waste your $.
