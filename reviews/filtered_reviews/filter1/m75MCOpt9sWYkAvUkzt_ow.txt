Fish burrito????? More like fish TAQUITO. This thing was like the size of the taquitos you get in the frozen aisle at Safeway. Tiny piece of fish inside. It wasnt a fish burrito, it was a tortilla burrito, like bread rolled up with nothing in it. The salsa tasted like it came out of a can from walmart, and the chips couldnt be plainer, they tasted like eating card-board dropped in a fryer. Will never come back here. And cash only, wtf??? get a credit card machine, its almost 2016. Other than that, everything was pretty good.
