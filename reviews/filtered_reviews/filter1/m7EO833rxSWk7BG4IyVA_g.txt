Honestly one of the worst Mexican food I have ever tasted. Ordered the portobello mushroom toastado which tasted so bad. The marination of mushroom with chillelime had a very strong pungent flavor. They charged us for the chips and salsa which we thought   was complementary and was not informed that it wasn't for free! Salsa tasted like a store bought one. I wish I had tried any other restaurants near by!
