First bad review I've ever had to give Manuel's and it hurts my heart! I ordered 2 portions of albondigas over the phone for a to go order as I just had surgery. Both portions were broth & veggies, NO meatballs at all! My nephew called to let them know & to get some & the woman who answered the phone ARGUED that there were meatballs in it! Really? Can u show me, cuz I know what a meatball looks like & I sure don't see any!
The broth & veggies is very tasty, but would be so much better with meatballs & I am just so upset that the woman argued with my nephew, that's terrible TERRIBLE customer service!
