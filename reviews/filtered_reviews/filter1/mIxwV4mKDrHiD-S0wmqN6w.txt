I used to come to this place almost every weekend and it used to be packed. 

The past few times I've been there the mood wasn't great but I thought it must have just been an off night.

When I pulled up tonight there were barely any cars in the parking lot.  I walked in to remixed rock music playing, and a few tables with passed out drunk people sleeping. This was at 10.30 pm! I could not believe how dead the place was. 

The bathrooms have always needed major attention, yet years later the same stalls are still shut down, leaving the remaining ones overflowing as usual.

The reason why we finally left 1 1/2 hours later was the service. Or the lack thereof. Two waitresses were hanging out 10 feet away from us, chatting, texting,  avoiding eye contact. They frequently walked past us, immediately reverting their eyes as soon as they accidentally made eye contact. We did see them serve a table with a few guys. I guess their motto is "No shlong, no service". All we wanted was a beer and some chips and salsa, but were unable to get any service. We left promising that we will not return.  SALT Y'S: please apply for "Bar Rescue"! It's too nice of a location to let it go to crap. We were very disappointed.
