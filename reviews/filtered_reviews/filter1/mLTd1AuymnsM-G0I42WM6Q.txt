My husband and I used to eat at La Parilla in Mesa often. However, our last experience was the worst ever! 

We had out of town guests and took them here for some good Mexican cuisine. Our waiter was incredibly rude and acted as though he could not be bothered with us. Everything was an inconvenience to him. We asked for extra napkins and refills on our water and he acted as though we asked him for a kidney.

He took his time bringing us water and forget about getting a refill on our chips! Apparently, he could not be bothered to do his job. We were mortified and embarrassed at how we were treated. His name is "Rodriguez" (at least that's what was printed on our bill). The food was delicious, but the waiter's attitude ruined what would have been a great evening.

I tried to let the management know what happened, but their email has conveniently been full for weeks! We will NEVER go back to this place. We'd sooner eat at Taco Bell then to be treated as poorly as we were. 

FIRE RODRIGUEZ!!!!!
