Food is okay, management is very bad. There are far too many options for good food in Scottsdale to deal with stupidity. The manager here tells his servers not to give paying customers free kids entrees on Sundays after 4. We have been here 6 times and all six times they did not comp the Children's meals as per their Sunday menu after 4.  Our bill is well over $150.00 each time and yet each time they "forget" to take it off.  Won't go again.
