This Cafe Rio is by our house and we used to eat here all of the time. Loved it. Now? HATE it. We went tonight for dinner after not eating here for a couple of months because the service was so bad. The service tonight was even worse!

We walk in thinking we'll have our food in about 5ish minutes, as there were only about seven people in front of us and two were ready to pay. Fast forward over TWENTY minutes later, and our order was finally taken. They were understaffed, and the employees could have given two craps less about the job they were doing. Once we finally got our food, we couldn't even sit down because every table in the place was dirty even though there were only about three full tables in the entire restaurant! We had to clean one ourselves. 

Not only was the service horrendous, but the food is only subpar at best now. The rice at this location is always cooked improperly now. How hard is it to cook rice?!?! Try taking a bite into half cooked rice and almost breaking your teeth on rice that is not cooked at all and hard as a rock. Not yummy, that's for sure. And tonight, my flour tortilla for my taco might as well have been a crunchy corn tortilla. It was as hard as a rock! It was terrible.

We are DONE with this Cafe Rio. Such a shame that they let it go so downhill.
