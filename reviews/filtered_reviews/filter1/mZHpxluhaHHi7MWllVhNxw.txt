First of all, I'm a major YELP user, and like most of you on here, I look at Yelp for food recommendations; however, I am a terrible Yelper and never actually post anything on here. This place was so bad, that I actually had to find time to post something to inform the public on how terrible this place is!

Coming home from Red Rock Canyon, we (party of 4) decided to give this place a try.

The hostesses seemed lost when I requested a table for four. She just walked in a circle around the restaurant before going back to the front to ask another hostess for help on where to seat us ?!  

We ordered the mussels, which were super tiny and came with half of them still closed. Why would you serve totally closed mussels to your patrons?  The dates, at a whopping $6 for three, don't even have a nut in the middle like Firefly giving them no texture.  The sangria was good, however, it was overloaded with ice in an attempt to minimize alcohol content and maximize volume with ice.  The bruschetta with ham (NOT PROSCIUTTO AS IT SHOULD BE) was good, but for 7-8$ for two tiny pieces, it was way overpriced.  We also ordered Scallops, Sausage, and another item which we cancelled because we just wanted to leave and find another place to eat.

Basically, everything is so overpriced that you will spend 40$ per person and leave totally hungry.  The quality of the shrimp, mussels, and other meats is so poor and tiny that it seems that the owners are simply taking advantage of the "Summerlin Area" by charging such high prices for such low quality.

Finally, this "Tapas Restaurant" actually has gaming machines and huge flat screen TV's all over it with football playing loudly on all screens making this a hyped-up PT's rather than a Spanish-feeling restaurant. 

Stick with Barcelona, Firefly, or another tapas restaurant if you want to leave full and satisfied, not hungry and ripped-off.
