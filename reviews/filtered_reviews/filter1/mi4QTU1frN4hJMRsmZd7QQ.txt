I heard so many good things about this place, but I was severely let down by the entire experience. 

For starters, the house salsa was actually marinara sauce. I wouldn't call myself a salsa expert, but I think I know the difference between salsa and a can of tomato paste with oregano mixed into it.
Secondly, I split a plate of nachos with two other people and we all agree; it was just chips covered in ranch dressing and some canned peppers for garnish.
Lastly, our server was extremely rude to us. It was a slow night, and she should've been happy to have a table of 8 people (6 of whom were buying expensive drinks) because her income most likely relies on tips. Everyone was very kind to her, and we received nothing but snide comments in return. The icing on the cake was her and four other staff members also closing our tabs and telling us they were starting to close at 10 pm on a night where they were open till 12.
