Been here so many times. I Everytime I've been there the waitresses are running around in a panic and there's usually two hostesses standing there doing nothing. I asked her for takeout menu and she said she wasn't sure where they were. What is the point of your hostesses. To stand there all day. Taking my money elsewhere.
