Be sure that if you have a group on that you show and tell the waiter , the  host and the owner what's in your group ticket   If you don't they will try to over charge you and "Assume" you want the extras and charge you! This is so upsetting all of the above were rude , unprofessional and especially the manager , threatening to call the police when they were in the wrong , after all that they waived the extra charges because Assuming to call the police was not putting a scare into us when they were in the wrong!!'
