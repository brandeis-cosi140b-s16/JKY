Lame as hell! Jeff the "MC" needs a lesson in customer service. Repeatedly telling a woman he was going to have her ejected from the club for shouting for a male friend on stage. THEN, when our friend who is a PROFESSIONAL singer wanted to do karaoke he told her NO in a very rude way. Even our waitress and her manager came over and apologized with free shots. This place us getting one star for JEFF. Kayla our waitress and the manager are cool. The place is cool except for JEFF!!!!! Jeff is in the wrong business.  Jeff shouldn't be an MC.
