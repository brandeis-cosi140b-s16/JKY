Very disappointed in this place.  All the food i ordered was overly spicy... I love spicy food but this was just spicy to a point of unenjoyable. Chicken was very bland but the beef was actually decent - probably the only positive thing of my experience. Also, the price was NOT WORTH the portion.  I'm not sure if they skimped on it since I was a take-out order, but I was shocked at how little food I got.
