My one and only experience here:

The food was decent but nothing to brag about.

The drinks were good and not too badly priced.

The waitress was a thieving scumbag.  We were given a bill just after we finished our food which was 1 entree/1 drink each.  I noticed the bottom of the receipt was torn off but figured maybe they had just changed out the tape.

We decided to order a second round of drinks and received a second bill also with the bottom torn off.  At this point I was suspicious.  We both added up our tabs (1 entree, 2 drinks) and figured them to be about $30.  We gave our debit cards and both got CC receipts only (the itemized receipt mysteriously disappeared) for about $45 each.  I asked if the tip was already included and she got really nervous.  We sent her away and asked the waitress from the next table to get a manager.

We had the manager sit down and asked her to estimate our bill based on the menu prices.  We explained the torn/missing receipts and she immediately took care of everything.  We had to wait quite a few minutes for the issue to be resolved and noticed that our waitress had been missing for at least 15 minutes and other people were helping her tables.

I assume she was fired on the spot - and even though the manger did everything right, the food just wasn't good enough to return here especially with so many other better Mexican food options in town.
