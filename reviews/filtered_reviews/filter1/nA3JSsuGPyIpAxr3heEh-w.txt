Sorry Z'Tejas I've heard a lot about you so we gave it a try, not good at all.... My husband had the Ribeye and looked and tasted as if it were cooked in a mircrowave or boiled. The mashed potatoes tasted like they came from a box and the veggies were like a bag of steam fresh mixed veggies that you microwave. I had the trout with rice and veggies, again nothing special, very mediocre.  I seriously felt like I was eating a meal from Denny's and just paid a lot more. Will not be back.
