We had a meeting in the area and the seven of us decided to hit Aunt Chilada's for a late lunch. It was convenient but that's about all.

The service was friendly and quick enough, but the selections were completely overpriced. I ended up requesting just an appetizer just to keep within my lunch budget.

The lemonade was bad. As in made with turned lemons and not sweet at all. And if they didn't make it, they need to clean the fountain machine or something.

I got a shredded beef quesadilla and it was so greasy I had to tip my plate to keep the remainder from swimming while I tried to eat. It tasted good once I squeezed out the drippings from each piece. I wasn't impressed.

But what annoyed me the most was although they automatically added a 20% tip onto every ticket, when the server brought back my change from a $20, she kept the extra 83 cents. Rounding up quite a bit there, eh? $2.73 tip for a crappy $9.50 appetizer is asking too much.

Next time someone suggests this place, I'll pass.
