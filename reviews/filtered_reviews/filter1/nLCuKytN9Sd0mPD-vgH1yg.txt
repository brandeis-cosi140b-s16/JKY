The  atmosphere was okay the waiters looks like they were hanging out not really looking at there tables. food was okay two good item like guajillo crispy tacos.  And Elotes asados good as well. I can not say the same for sea bass tacos. They were plain even though they had slaw n a bland Chipotle sauce.  N there carne that had no Mexican influence or taste at all. The sangria was murky and watered down.  No thanks
