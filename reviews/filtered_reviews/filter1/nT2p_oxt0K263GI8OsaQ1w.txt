Food was decent but Vicente our server was a real jerk.  It was our first night at the South Point and the only reason we stayed was because my parents were curious about it.  I work like a dog as a bartender in a Mexican Food restaurant and I was excited to start my night off at a place that seems highly recommended.  
We got to the host stand and a little old lady greeted us but had very little personality.  She gave us a buzzer and told us it would be about a 20-30 minute wait.  That's cool cause I'm on vacation and I am in no rush.  We get seated and a busser promptly asks us if we want something to drink so I get a margarita on the rocks, my girlfriend gets an iced tea, and our 9 year old son gets a virgin pi√±a colada.  About 5 minutes later Vicente shows up and asks what we want to drink and the busser tells him.  That seems off that they have a busser ask when it is the waiters responsibility.  We eventually get our drinks and the margarita was strong and I was in a great mood.  Vicente took some time to get to us and we got our food orders in.  Now we have our food and it is just okay.  We get our bill and I give Vicente the free margarita coupon the hotel gives you in those silly discount books you pay for with the stupid hotel fee.  He gets mad and says "what is that?" I tell him and he gets even more upset and calls over the manager and says "what am I suppossed to do with this?"  The manager miraculously gives me the free margarita.  Turns out the free margarita is suppossed to be given to them before you order so that they can give you the water down garbage.  I got the real deal and that irked Vicente quite a bit it looks like.  So if you want a real margarita and can take Vicentes funky little attitude then give him the coupon at the end.  I told the manager how he acted and her and some other server acted like they could care less.  Thanks Baja Miguel!
