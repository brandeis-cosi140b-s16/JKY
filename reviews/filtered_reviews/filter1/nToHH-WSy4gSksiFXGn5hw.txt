I sincerely wish I could go lower than one star, this place should be shut down immediately. I ordered shrimp and garlic sauce and a kiss cake. If you look online the picture makes it look Like a 5 Star delicious meal.. WRONG you will get 10-15 shell shrimp barley cooked. The driver comes up says sorry sir they tried calling (LIE) they where out if kiss cake so they gave me something else. So thinking to myself don't knock it before you try it I proceed to eat a few shrimp mistake #1 for me I immediately regret it call the restaurant and ask for my money back. 10 min go by I start throwing up in a bag in my room .. Guarantee food poisoning if you eat here. VEGAS SHUT THEM DOWN!
