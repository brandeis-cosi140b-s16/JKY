Funny how my previous review from May 5, 2012 keeps getting deleted!  So much for consistency.  I'll be on YELP every day reposting for each deletion.  

Original review from 5/5/12:


experienced our first bout with real discrimination today at the Salty Senorita near Arrowhead Mall. To prepare for Cinco de Mayo, all of the handicapped spaces were barricaded to allow for the anticipated lines to the entrance. I approached one of the staff members and advised them that my husband is disabled and required access (not to mention it being ILLEGAL and a FEDERAL OFFENSE to not offer disabled parking spaces). Other staff members joined the conversation and advised that this was a special event so they had the right to block off the spaces. "Oh really? Where is your permit?" I asked. One guy looked at my husband and said loud enough for me to overhear - "he's not really handicapped anyway"..... LOOK DUDE - walk a mile in my husband's shoes and you'll know what it feels like to have a titanium rod in your leg, metal pins holding your spine together and enduring head trauma that required TWO craniotomies, a liver laceration, 7 broken ribs and internal damage that left a scar from nipple to hip. When you've done that, you'll understand how he deserves to park just a little closer to your establishment than someone who doesn't have those issues. PRICK! Lucky for you, my husband didn't have his cane with him or I would have knocked you off your feet with it. 

To all my Phoenix area friends, please boycott Salty Senorita's...
