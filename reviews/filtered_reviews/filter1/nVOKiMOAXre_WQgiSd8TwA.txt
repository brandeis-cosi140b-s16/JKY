I typically LOVE Cafe Rio...  I have eaten at Cafe Rio over 100 times and this was by far my worst experience yet!  The line was all backed up yet they kept taking orders...  Yelling across the lobby to the back of the line of what people wanted.  By the time I actually got up there my food was cold and the tortillas were stale...  Then when we finally paid for the food, my son spilled a drink - he went and asked one of the employees for a rag to clean up and they handed him 1 napkin...  My son said it was an entire drink so they gave him 10 napkins and offered no help!  Then as I kept taking dripping napkins from the table to the trash I couldn't help but overhear the 3 employees just standing in front of the soda machine talking about how bad it was to work there and how no one is trained including the person on the grill that day that had no training!  This location is officially on the boycott list!
