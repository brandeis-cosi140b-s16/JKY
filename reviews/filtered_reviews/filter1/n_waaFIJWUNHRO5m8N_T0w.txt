My Family and I Love Cafe Rio. We had visited the location on Stephanie. The Service is Great.   A new Cafe Rio opened in My area at 65 E. Horizon Ridge and it was really close to my house. I have used this location several times. Tonight I have reached my final visit to that location. On 3 separate visits they have ran  out tortillas, Shredded chicken,  beans and tonight salad dressing. We waited in line for at least 1 hour. At other location that I have been to in Henderson. There is no problem with the line. You wait but the line keeps moving. This location the staff is never prepared. I complained tonight 11/14 between 6 and 7 pm.  I asked for A Manager and this unproffesicsl Girl said that's how it was left to her. And then just walked away.  I then said I will change my order that is ridiculous you have no dressing. I just waited for a hour. The girl at the second prep area  just rolls her eyes. After I lost my patience,  cause nobody in there really cares. It's Dinner time on a Friday Night and you are unprepared AGAIN and out of food.  At that moment a burrito gets thrown on the counter.. The Cashier could care less either..I'm Done... I tell my kids let's go. I said I will no longer use this location. I will drive farther just so I don't have to visit this store. I have never had a problem with the 509 N Stephanie Location.
