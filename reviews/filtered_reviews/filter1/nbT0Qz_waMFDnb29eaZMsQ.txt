Yuk. I wouldn't have chosen to eat here on a regular day, but considering this was the only restaurant in the cosmo that didn't have a $150 prixe fixe menu on NYE (who wants to stuff their face with $150 worth of food before dancing their ass off on NYE???) I had no choice. I made a reservation on opentable. A few days later they called me to take a credit card down since we had a party of more than 8, fine. A few days after that I randomly noticed that they dropped my reservation to 5:30?! If I had not noticed that we would've lost our space... wtf. Thankfully after I called, they were able to change it. 

They also had a set menu which was all shell fish and pork and had NO substitute options. Two of my guests couldn't even eat half the food. One of my friends who is allergic to shrimp, accidentally ate some and they didn't have benedryl on hand... that should be standard for a restaurant. I asked for them to comp her meal and they kindly agreed to do it, but after we paid I noticed that they charged for the makeshift substitutes they served... wow thanks for nothing! 

Last but definitely least, was the food. What a gross compilation of food. The worst was the vomit pepper... literally looked like a green pepper with baby vomit on it and it didn't taste much different. 

Nope nope nope...
