Used to be really good, but I guess they got too comfortable. I used to be a regular here. Then I went once earlier this year and noticed a huge downgrade in quality of the food & ingredients used and in the service provided. Hoping it was just a bad day- I went back again but had the same less-than-stellar experience. Don't plan to go back.
