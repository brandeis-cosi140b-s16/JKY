I was excited to have a variety of nachos when I spontaneously pulled in and decided to take my family here..... The good was awesome....UNFORTUNETLY
The Service sucked. I have never in my life wrote a review but decided someone should know. 5 min for the drink order great! 20 min to come back and get the appetizer order - NO DICE! The food came out blazing and wonderful .... Never got the rest of my order after two girls took it cause I couldn't tell anyone. Couldn't get a napkin for 15 min?.... Had to flag the cocktail waitress (awesome sauce BTW) when I commented  about the jalapeños bites... "Well they are jalapeños ... Thank you very much.... Did you even graduate? Aside the salty Bitches
The food was great and the cocktail service was wonderful ....NEVER AGAIN
