Worst service I've experienced in Charlotte. Took more than 30 min to get wine, in fact didn't see our server for 20 min. I keep hearing that this place can't get it together and clearly after 5 months it still hasn't happened. Stay away, there's many more Mexican spots in the city with better service.
