This Place is the Biggest Bull Bleep I been to in Vegas.  The promo write ups talk about how this is the inventors of the margarita, Playboy, Urban Daddy and Seven.  The original margarita was made with Tequila, limes and Damiana.  Not only did they tell us that they didn't have Damiana but that it wasn't available in the state.  Funny I picked up a bottle at Lee's the next day.  Stay away from this place.  $10.- small house margaritas.
