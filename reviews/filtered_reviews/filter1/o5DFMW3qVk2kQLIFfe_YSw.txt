1 star is too many for the Cafe Rio location on Gilbert. After eating there, I was horribly ill.  Was up all night with food poisoning.  Cafe Rio has completely turned me off from eating Mexican food of any kind.  I wish AZ had their health grades posted in the window like they do in CA.  But unfortunately, AZ residents have to go in blind and trust that the restaurant they are dining in is free from filth and contaminates.  If you go there, good luck!
