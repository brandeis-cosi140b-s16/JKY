This place Senor Frogs... We went there for my neices 9th birthday this past week. She wanted to go somewhere fun and unique. The first appearance of this place was "ok cool, this could be fun." until we got to our table. Once we sat down, the air was so thick and HOT that it was hard to breath, once we asked if they could turn on the air or the fans, their reply was "I don't know if we have any." Then the swarm of Effin gnats flying around, mass of dead bugs on the window sills, we asked for a new table. We finally got to our new seats next to an open window with an awesome view of the "T.I. Harbor" which we thought, ok this is better. Upon sitting there, the gnats were so over-whelming, that everytime you open your mouth to take of a bite of this CRAPPY food, you also ate a few gnats along with it!!! It was simply disgusting, flying in your face and up your nose, just crawling in your ears.. HORRIBLE. I've lived in Vegas almost 7 years, and by far... the biggest DISAPPOINTMENT I have ever had the displeasure of eating at. My Gf and I are Chefs at hotels here, and this place was just sad. The only reason for the "1" star.. you get a cool view of the pirate show, which none on Senor Frogs staff members attempt to warn you of the fire and explosions 15 feet out the window, we had twin 8 month old babies with us...I have never Yelped before, but this place brought an urge on me to do so. Its a POOR ass Attempt at mexican food, actually a Disgrace to my culture and heritage... DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!
