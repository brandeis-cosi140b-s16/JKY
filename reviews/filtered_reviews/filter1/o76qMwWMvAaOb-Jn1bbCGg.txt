The only reason I give this place one star is because the bartender was a kind, hard-working woman. My fiancé and I showed up for the first time at 11:30 pm but saw that the bar was open and people were eating so we decided to try it. I ordered chicken tortilla soup and my fiancé ordered the pork carnitas burrito. The burrito came out so fast it seemed like a frozen microwave burrito and my pathetic excuse for chicken tortilla soup was hot and that's about the only good thing I can say about it. My soup had cabbage, carrots, whole bay leaves, one piece of chicken and some tortilla strips thrown on top. Worst chicken tortilla soup I've ever had and what a let down. No black beans, corn, avocado, cilantro OR cheese ??? I don't know if we'll ever go back but hopefully they're popular fish tacos taste delicious because our menu items were terrible. The kitchen should serve quality food at all hours and just because I come at night shouldn't mean I should expect poor quality, especially in this city.
