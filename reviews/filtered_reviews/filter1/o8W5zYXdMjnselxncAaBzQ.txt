NO! Walking by this place makes you think it's fast food but of course it's at the Cosmopolitan so it wasn't cheap and we were wrong! Can't give much review on the food because after we saw it was $14 for two tacos we got up and left. If you're a rich bitch, it's a great place for you but if not there's a taco place next to twin peaks on the strip that's amazing!! :)
