Hands down worst service in vegas!! Lord forbid any of them crack a smile! I frequent here due to loving the food, plus location wise... It is the best option for us.  At this point the one at centennial may be worth the drive! The owner really needs to get rid of the whole staff and try again. I truly can not stand bad costumer service. Why work in costumer service if you hate it?!? They all seriously look miserable as the THROW your food together! I really hope the owner/manager reads all of these reviews and does something about it.
