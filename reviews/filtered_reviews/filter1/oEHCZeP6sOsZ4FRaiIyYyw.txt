Came here for a bite to eat at about 3 in the afternoon. It was pretty crowded considering the time. I can't imagine the crowds it likely draws in during peak hours. You may want to avoid coming during meal "rush hours". Anyway, we arrived and had to wait about two minutes to be seated. I can't complain though, since we had a large party.  But given the time, I'd expect it would take a bit less time than that. After the brief wait, we were seated and immediately jostled with chip baskets. They were mediocre at best in my opinion, and the salsa was horrendous. They also provided guacamole, though it was a wasted effort considering we had already munched on the majority of the chips. To add insult to injury, the guacamole was topped with tomatoes, which I despise. It's not very considerate of those like me who have no taste for tomatoes. I personally would have put the tomatoes to the side to at least give those dining a choice. The guacamole itself was average. After eating all of the chips, I found myself low on the sprite I had requested. Instead of getting more sprite after being asked if I would like a refill, I was disappointed with water. A bit more waiting and our food finally arrived. I ordered a chicken quesadilla and had already given my silverware to another member at my table since I was expecting to be able to eat utensil-free. But, it was huge and floppy. It would've been nearly impossible to eat neatly without utensils, so it was necessary to get some. The portion was so huge I couldn't even finish it all. It's hard to imagine how somebody could've eaten it in one sitting. It wasn't horrible tasting, but unmemorable. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place unless you haven't eaten for 3 days and are willing to pay for overpriced food that is mediocre or below.
