We have been several times. Service has been good, food is ok for quick Mexican.
Tonight, we started out ok until the flys took over. Seriously, pick up your  drink and brush the fly off, pick up you taco and a fly is on it. We spent the time we were there waving our hands around. When I told the manager, she said, yes, we know. " They keep coming in when the doors open and close. " Last time I checked, all restaurants have doors. The glass door by our table was covered with flys.

Gross, will not be back, especially after that lame response.
