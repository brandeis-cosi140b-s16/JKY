Terrible, terrible, terrible service!  I had just arrived from California, it was hot and I was starving.  I wanted Mexican so I decided to give this a whirl.  Granted we got there at 8 and they close at 10, but still.  Hostess sat us down and handed us menus.  No one came for about 15 minutes until I got up to notify the hostess.  She said "oh, sorry there must have been some confusion with the waiters. Uh, ok! She took our order, brought us out drinks and after we got our food, our server showed up.  A little too late I thought.   She asked if we needed refills and we said no.  My friend asked for a side of beans and the girl forgot, says "oh no I forgot about those but I'll make sure they're pipping hot when they come out".  She was a complete airhead!  The food was mediocre at best!  Won't be going back to this place, yuck!
