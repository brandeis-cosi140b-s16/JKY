Holy cr@p...where do I start?

This place makes Disneyworld look cheap, the most overpriced restaurant in all of Las Vegas.....

$7.00 bud lights?
$45.00 Margarita pails?
$17.00 chicken sandwich? (average,but good fries with it)
$25.00 Fajita's?

Average food at best, my partner only ate part of his rib platter because he did not really like it...($30.00)

I live near this place and understand it's for drunken out of towners who don't care what they are charged on vacation....But it's beyond stupid the prices,it's as bad as the high end nightclubs here.

 It is sooo loud you can't even give your waitress the damn order, and the noise never stops.....

Great place for rich, dumb, annoying and loud alcoholics.....Never again for me



Did I mention the all night stomach ache after the chicken sandwich?
