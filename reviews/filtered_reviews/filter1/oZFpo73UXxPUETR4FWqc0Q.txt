Just went to Pepe's Tacos and ordered 9 tacos. I was surprised when the cost with tax came to $19.46. That seems very expensive for just tacos but I figured they must be crazy good or crazy big. When they handed me one tiny paper bag I had to ask them if they made a mistake. I checked and inside were 9 tiny tacos that should have not cost more than .99 cents on a good day. And after just sharing the 9 with two friends We all agree they were mediocre at best and still very hungry. Save yourself the money and go to another taco shop, I wish I had.
