oh hell to the naw...I went to this place for the first time because hubby said he saw it on tv the day before and let me tell you, the service or lack was sooooo bad.  We waited about 45 minutes for our food, 45 FREAKIN MINUTES!!!!!!!! and the only reason my hubby didnt complain was because sports center was on.  Now let me get to the food the fried rice is ok and the the red jade chicken was fine also, but nothing I would drive 20 minutes to get to ever again in my life.  But I will give them one star because my better half liked his food a little better than I did.  Oh and let me not forget those free cookies which we got about 8 of probably because they had us waiting so long.  And that would have been all good if they didnt crumble and taste like sand paper in your mouth except for the huge chunks of chocolate chips that my hubby pointed out.
