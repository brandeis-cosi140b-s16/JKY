Wahoo's is a mediocre. No salsa bar like Ruibio's or Baja Fresh, and they charge for each little side of salsa. What kind of taco shop/mexican food place nickle and dimes you for salsa? Fish is dry and flavorless so it needs to be drowned in salsa to be enjoyed. Best thing about this place is the location and view from the bar, go to have a beer but eat somewhere else.  Can't recommend.
