I can't stand this place, but seem to end up dragged here for birthday parties. Maybe it's the Saturday night crowd that makes it so awful. I'm not sure, but every time I come I leave pissed off and broke. 
We usually rent one of the "cabana's", which really isn't worth it because it gets so crowded you end up with a bunch of random people all in your space anyhow. They also grat your check at 50 percent. YEP! Our bill for the 3 of us (yes they did split checks after throwing a fit about it) was $120.00. We had strictly beer and wine. After looking closely, the added on tip was $59.00. We never saw the server again, so we signed and left. I hate it so much here anyhow, I would have payed every last cent in my checking to get the hell out of here. 
The staff is slow (though they are way overworked) and rude. The bussers and bouncers like to say "get out of my way". (Real nice). 
I guess it would be fun here if you like getting "totally wasted" with a bunch of less-than 21 year old's trying to hook up and pull some sub par dance moves on the tiny inside dance floor (which you step up to get onto and people are always bailing on the stairs). So I guess if you like watching drunk people falling you should stand here! 
It's just crowded, messy, rude, and reminds me of Spring Break in college seeing how drunk and obnoxious I could get in Rocky Pointe. 
No thanks. Next time there is an event here I will try to plan a dinner first and skip out on "all the fun to (NOT) be had" here. 
Maybe it's better on a slower weeknight, but I honestly don't care to find out.
