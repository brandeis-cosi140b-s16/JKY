I'm still feeling my regrets for coming into this place. What a joke. 

 My mom and I have this thing about Mexican food/tex-mex restaurants in the valley-we've eaten at most all of them. When we go out for lunch, we generally look for a new one to try in the area we plan on being in around that time. Unfortunately, this is the place we stumbled upon. 

 Our server seemed already "put off" by us for some reason..I'm blaming it on the fact that I was wearing something with a pattern so he automatically knew I must be one of those "artistic" types who like real food and not some shitty Mexican version of Fuddruckers. We were doomed from the start. 
 
 I'll save you the details just because even I'M annoyed by how annoyed I was with every interaction with my server. After looking over the menu, I decided that I wasn't that into anything and just wanted a burrito. 

Word for word:

 Me - Can I get a burrito, beans, rice and sour cream only. 
 
 Oh and can you grill it, or put it on your flat top?

 Douche - WELL YEA THAT'S HOW THEY DO IT,....pFFFTttt, HOW ELSE DO YOU MAKE A BURRITO. WE ALWAYS MAKE THEM LIKE THAT

 ....
...
 ...

 Me - Oh. I usually have to ask. Okaaay.

 - Server puts in the order then comes back.

 Douche - SO DO YOU WANT THAT ON THE FLAT TOP BECAUSE IT'LL FALL THROUGH ON THE GRILL.

 Me - Yea that's fine.

 Douche - LIKE TACO BELL

 Me - Ok.

 ...

 inner monologue Me - LISTEN DICK, YOUR MENU ISN'T APPETIZING SO JUST GIVE ME A FUCKING TORTILLA  A BEAN AND SOME TOMATO SO I CAN HAVE A MEAL WITH MY MOM THAT DOESN'T REVOLVE AROUND YOU BEING AN ASSHOLE.

 ehem..

 Food came and I ate about a third of it before noticing little chunks of bacon in my burrito. THANK GOD I'm not a real vegetarian even though I say I am, I eat seafood and will try meat when I feel the quality of meat is on par with excellence at restaurants worthy of my money.. 

 I also got the pleasure of witnessing about 11 plates of food up on the line for about 5 minutes, just sitting there while the servers folded silverware into napkins and talked about Carlos Mencia...or something equally as boring.

 Needless to say, I reluctantly left a tip. 
  
 I walked away immediately feeling nauseous and thoroughly grossed out by the whole experience - now 24 hours later - I have a headache that won't go away, what feels like the stomach flu and an intense feeling that I can never enjoy a burrito again. 

 ..I hope the lack of interest in burrito's is a phase, Blanco, for your sake.

 I'll never betray you again, Taco's Jalisco's.
