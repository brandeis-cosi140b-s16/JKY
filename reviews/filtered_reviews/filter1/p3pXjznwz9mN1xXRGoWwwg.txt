Horrible service, slow lines, complacent employees...and when they run out of menu items the manager is completely unapologetic. The food is decent but it's certainly not worth waiting 30 minutes in line for to find out they don't have the special of the day. WTF?! Management needs to step up, there was absolutely no expediting of orders or organization. Did I mention not one of the employees can multi task?! No thanks, this city is too big for shitty service. I'll go elsewhere.
