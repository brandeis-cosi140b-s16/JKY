Wish I had read the reviews here before going to this lousy restaurant. Most of the things we didn't like about our visit other reviewers have already mentioned in recent reviews: our table was all sticky even though we were among the first customers for the day; the hard chairs were uncomfortable, if you're not tall your feet will be dangling when you sit; our nachos were good but my friend said his chicken fajitas were really lacking in flavour and my beef chimichanga was not even the way it was described in the menu -no cheese, no sour cream, only a tiny bit of sauce underneath and inside half the filling was the same red rice that was served as a side order on my plate. Why would somebody want so much rice? This was a very poorly composed entr√©e. How about getting rid of some of that rice and instead have some retried beans, cheese, sour cream, salsa, salad or something instead of all that rice? 
And you better like that bright red sauce they use because they seem to use it on everything; the nachos, the rice, the sauce on a stuffed tortilla. 
After I asked for my missing sour cream it didn't get brought to our table until we had both given up on wanting to eat this overpriced, bland meal. 
Oh yeah, the tall Margarita slush drinks tasted weak, too. If you want a good one with lots of Tequila at a good price try the Circus Circus casino. 
We were kicking ourselves thinking that we could of had a pretty good steak dinner somewhere else for what we paid at this joint, and we had a Groupon too. Never again; you've been warned.
