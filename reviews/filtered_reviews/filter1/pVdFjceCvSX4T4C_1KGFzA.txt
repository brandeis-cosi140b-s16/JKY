The only good thing about this place is the decor. The food is horrible, again horrible. We went for lunch. I ordered tacos, chicken, cod, and al pastor. All of which had no flavor. The "homemade" tortillas were dry. My friend ordered the crab blt and it was also flavorless and dry. We started off with a sushi roll. Shrimp and tuna. The tuna tasted like it was sitting out and not set at the right temperature before serving. The endless amount of red pepper salt they put on everything was obnoxious. The server asked if we liked the food and we told her we didn't like it. And she did nothing about it. We definitely won't be going back.
