Such a shame!!!  We have been dining at Abuelos for over 3 years now and the service and food has always been incredible.  My wife and I frequented Abuelos a few years ago for the great happy hour and incredible service by one of the bartenders i believe his name was john.  We would walk in and instantly he would have our drinks and greet us with a smile and small talk.  Unfortunately he's been gone for some time now and since leaving, the bar service is less than average.  We are very low maintenance and simple to please but for some reason it feels like we're a burden on the staff now.  Occasionally we will ask where John went and the guy that worked with him for years will shrug and say he doesn't know but his reaction is always strange.  We used to love Abuelos but now we are simply displeased with the service and the lack of friendly comfort we used to feel.  They should find john and bring him back if they want to succeed!
