If I could give this place an effin zero I would. This is my second post in 2 and a half years and there hasn't been the slightest of improvements. I was having a blue moon at the outside bar and the bartender tells me I can't have glass on the patio. So I tell her to give me a plastic cup that's at the end of the bar. How ingenious is that ish? Because I have insulted her intelligence,  she calls security. Im so happy to be blessed with common sense. Unlike the aholes at this place. Smh in disgust...
