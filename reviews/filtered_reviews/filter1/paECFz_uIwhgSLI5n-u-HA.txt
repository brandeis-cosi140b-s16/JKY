I went here on first Friday and have to say it was some of the worst service I've ever received. We waited 30 minutes for a table because the hostess thought we no longer wanted to sit down and eat. The manager walked by and quickly got us seated, but once seated we waited another 10 minutes when a person in our party had to ask the waiter for water and menus. Then another 20 minutes for them to take our order to which we never received napkins until asked. The food was awful, dry, and bland we had the carnitas, carne asada, and calamari tacos. The only thing that came out somewhat edible was the calamari. We will not be returning to this restaurant.
