We should have listened to our first intuition and hit up the pizza joint next door. However, we didn't and decided to try this place instead.

The chips were good and that is about it. The salsa that accompanies the chips, which by the way you have to pay almost $6 for was unimpressive. Then they charged us another $1 when we asked for more salsa to finish the initial quantity of chips that were supplied. What a rip-off.

My wife ordered the taquitos which seemed just like the cheap ones you can buy in any grocer freezer (not home made). She refused to eat them and fortunately to their credit, they removed them from the bill.

I had the street tacos which were okay but nothing to write home about. 

I can't speak for the quality of the booze that is served here as we went for lunch so maybe they serve good drinks. I dunno but a place like this wouldn't survive in my town.

Oh, and by the way, after leaving here, we did go to the pizza place next door which was fantastic (another review).
