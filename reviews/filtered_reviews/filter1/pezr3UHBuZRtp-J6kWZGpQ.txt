I have been to Mad Mex several times with mixed results.  Unfortunately, yesterday was definitely the WORST. I ordered the nachos with taco meat.  It looked awful when it was served and tasted worst.  Still undeterred I ordered the shrimp taquitos.  Again, the presentation was horrible, the exterior soggy and oily, the interior looked like cat food and tasted like it (I'm sure).  We were sitting at the bar, 3 of us and our service was mediocre. When I told our young bartender that my food was really bad she said nothing and did nothing.  I will never eat there again!
