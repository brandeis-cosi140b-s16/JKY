We had such a poor experience with this place last night.  Things started off poorly when there was clear conflict between the hostess and the server, Susanne.  After several attemps our party of three was finally sat. Our waitress gave us a couple of snide responses on menu questions   "what's in your Mexican style ceviche?"  "Its just ceviche."  That's not helpful.  Turns out it is fish and shrimp with tomatoes, onion and jalapenos.  

I explained my food allergy and she claimed the tacos were safe to eat after going off to check.  She did say they sometimes garnish with peppers but that it could be left off.  I ordered tacos and reminded her off my allergy.  I took one bite, swallowed a pepper and immediately reacted.  I was very sick the rest of the night and into this morning.  I had to run to the bathroom to avoid throwing up at the table.  The worst part is that the manager (i think his name was Frank) lied and said he had seen the ticket with the no peppers written on it! He later admitted to lying because it was not written on the ticket.  We had to force them to comp the meal we never ate (one appetizer and 1 order of tacos and 3 drinks that were never drunk).  

This level of service is ridiculous!  I clearly explained my food allergy and asked about ingredients in order to enjoy a business dinner out of town.  The experience at this place and their handling of it was appalling.
