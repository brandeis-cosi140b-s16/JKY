I have not been here since 8/10/12. Today we stopped by and had lunch. The food tasted good the service was good but about 20-30 minutes after eating we were all sick. We had bad cramps and to put it nice it was coming right out. Don't think I will be back called and left a message to have a manager call but never heard anything back from one. Will let you know if I hear anything.
