Did not like the food here.  Starting from the chips and salsa they put on our table I knew it was gonna be a bad meal.  The salsa was not good - it was sweet.  I asked the waiter to bring me the hot stuff.  When that came, it was hot but also sweet!  I thought this place was Mexican food!??!  

So I ordered a shredded beef enchilada. And guess what?  The enchilada sauce was sweet. Didn't even taste like enchilada sauce!  Basically if you are a diabetic don't come here!!  Too much sugar and sweets in everything. 

But the nachos were good.  The meal was somewhat saved a little bit when I found out that they have Negra Modelo on draft.
