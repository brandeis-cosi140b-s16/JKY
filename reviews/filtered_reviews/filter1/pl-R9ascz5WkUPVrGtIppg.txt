These were probably the worst street size tacos I've ever had and I can't believe I paid $10 for them.  I'm not sure what took them so long to bring them out. The shrimp taco was cold and I ate half of it before finding any shrimp. We sat at the bar and the bartender was nice enough and took order but didn't seem very interested in our presence. 
The best thing about this place was their artwork and decor.
