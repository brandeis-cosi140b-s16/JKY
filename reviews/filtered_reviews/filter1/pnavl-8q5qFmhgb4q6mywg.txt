I went here to get some tacos for lunch because everyone at work were raving about them. 

I ordered 2 shredded beef and 2 shrimp tocos on flour tortilla to go. when I got back to my work which was 500yards away I was excited to eat. When I opened the boxes I could not believe what I saw. My food did not even look like tacos. I got corn tortillas which were so soggy that I couldn't even eat with fingers. The shrimp was WAY overcooked and hard, and also some pieces still had shells on them. The shredded beef tacos looked horrible. I had a nice amount of meat which was good but it wasn't even inside the tortilla, also I got a total of about 5 pieces of onion between the two of the tacos and a tiny splash of "salsa". 

I am sure this place is way better than this but I am not a happy customer.
