We accidentally showed up during the hours of Sunday brunch. Big mistake. We had some familiar items but the quality wasn't as good. Upon arriving, they told us we could order the all-you-can-eat or a la carte. After the long wait and we had already decided on what we wanted  the waitress said if anyone wanted the all-you-can-eat, everyone would have to order it. Very soon after we had sat down, they told us it was last call for all you could eat; this came as a surprise because according to the hostess who sat us we had two hours.  We were just really bummed because we used to like this place, never going back.
