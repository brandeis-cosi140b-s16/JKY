2 days ago I went there to have the 20 vegetable fried rice. A big disappoint!!!!! I had seen this featured on some food channel. It was approximately 1 cup of rice with 2 pieces of tofu, 4 miniature carrots and a bunch of strings of fried carrots on the top. It came lukewarm. The waiter never came back to see if everything was allright. To add insult to injury it cost me $19.88 for that cup of rice.
