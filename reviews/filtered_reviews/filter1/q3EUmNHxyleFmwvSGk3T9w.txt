After being asked by a fellow yelper to elaborate, here it goes. 

We approached the hostess and asked for a table for 3 plus a high chair. When she jokingly said "no" I laughed and proceeded to ask for a menu to which she again replied "no"! I guess this was her attempt at humor, however after the first time, it seemed to have lost something. By the way, she never really indicated that she was joking.

So, $50, 1 ceasar salad, 1 spinach chicken whatever salad,  a kids chicken tender meal w/ browning apples, and a failed attempt at a pollo poblano burrito later we were on our way to catch our flight. 

Oh, in between sitting down and paying the check, the service was sub-par to say the least and worse than the cold, soggy burrito and rubberized tenders. The waitress never picked up our menus and never once smiled. 

While I understand we ate at an airport, this is unacceptable. Next time I'll be sure to read up on more yelp reviews before I waste a meal here. 

They'll be hearing from me soon.
