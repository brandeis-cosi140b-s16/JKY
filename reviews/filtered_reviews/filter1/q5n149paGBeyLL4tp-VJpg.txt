We arrived at the Mission having huge expectations based on good reviews. We waited at the bar and ordered a couple of their 14 dollar Margharitas. I watched as the bartender was making other drinks for the waiters and noticed she was short pouring the liquors in many drinks. I used to be a bartender so it was easy to notice. So my two 14 dollar Margharitas were 
mediocre at best and must say that my wife makes a better Margharita hands down.
 So we sit down at a table on the patio and proceed to order table side Guacamole where the tableside cart wont fit between the tables. So somewhere on the patio the guacolome was made . And it took 25-30 minutes to get the Guacomole served from the time we ordered it. Then we order scallops which are the worst I've tasted in sometime. The filet steak was good not great. They give you 3 bites of the poblano grits and 4 string beans like they might go broke if they fill the plate. When my wife gets done with her scallops she passes them over to me to finish. While I still have scallops on my plate the busboy comes over puts his hand on my plate and starts to remove my food without asking if I'm done. Not cool. I am not kidding but 2 minutes later the waitress comes over and starts to remove my plate without asking also. Needless to say I just wanted to get out of there. As Robert G said in his review they are trying to hustle you out when people are waiting. The manager did make good and removed scallops from the bill but the food is mediocre,the drinks are mediocre and the service sucks!!! I will never step foot in there again and I'm sure they are as glad as I am.
