It is possible to get really bad Mexican in the SouthWest. I rarely ever get burned with my food choices, but score one for Macayo's Mexican Restaurant. I was in Phoenix for five days and had three incredible mexican meals so just figured the odds of getting bad Mexican where similar to the odds of getting a bad slice in NYC. As a result, I let my guard down and went to Macayo's for no reason other than that it was close to my hotel. I'll never be that careless again. I knew I made a fatal mistake when I walked in the door: The place was huge and there were only people at five tables. The atomosphere was that tacky overdone carribean mexican feel with lot's of turqouise and other clashing colors combined with busy carpet. The gringo that took the order was another sign that this place was about as authentic as a made in china sticker. The salsa quite frankly was the worst I ever tasted. I would have begged them to bring out a bottle of Pace if I thought they had it. The chips were equally bad. The menu was completely unimaginative. I ordered a pork burro which came with absolutely nothing in it but bland laying in the pan pork. I paid $2 more for enchilada style which was supposed to come with sauce and melted cheese over it. In places where that kind of things worked the sauce is usually a deep red, here it was a depressing rust color that lacked any flavor. If there was melted cheese over it, there was so little it dissolved in the rusty sauce. My girlfriends Chile Relleno, which I didn't taste, was the worst she ever had. In a place where incredible mexican is the rule, I would venture to guess the over/under for this place staying in business is hours, and if it's not it deserves to be. AVOID!!!
