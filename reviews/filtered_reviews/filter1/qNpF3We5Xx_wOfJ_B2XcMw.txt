One star is too much for this restaurant. If I could give negative stars I would. Friends & I were looking forward to dinner here Javier's only to be very disappointed. To start the guacamole was bland. Then our meals took 30 minutes to get while we sat and watched table after table get their food. We didn't get our food all at once either. Three meals came out first, 5 minutes later, and finally 10 minutes after the first meals were served, the final dinner entree arrived. All plates were extremely hot because they were sitting under the heat lamps too long but the food was temped at best.  Not to mention the food wasn't that good either. 

Recommendation .... Skip this experience. Taco Bell is better than this!
