I hate turning in negative reviews on Yelp because I'm all about every place just has it's bad days but I feel this needs to be put out there. The reason for the negative review is not because of the food or service but rather because they are knowingly being deceitful. 

I'm huge on going to company's websites to learn about a place and what they offer. Well today I was going to be at Tempe Marketplace before going to a movie and so looked to see if there were any happy hour specials anywhere. Turns out the only place at TMP advertising happy hour on Saturday was San Felipe. So my buddy and I go there and order their happy hour beer only to find out when the bill came that they do not have happy hour on the weekends. I point out to the bartender that their website brags on the fact that they have happy hour 7-days a week and they need to change it. Turns out she told me that the management knows about that but they just won't do anything to change it. 

So even though I do like the cantina and have enjoyed my past visits, I will not go back until they stop lying to their customers. 

If they are trying to get customers through digital marketing, I figure I would do my part in letting people know what they were doing through social media. If they fix their website, I'll consider coming back.
