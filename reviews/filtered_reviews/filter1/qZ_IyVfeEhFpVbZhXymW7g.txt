I had high hopes for this place. I'd heard that Barrio had won awards and was a must-go place. My lady and I live close by so we decided to try it out. The wait was 45 minutes which was fine. We walked around and saw the artwork and the murals along 16th street and had a nice wait. When we were seated, we ordered drinks, the waiter mumbled a bit, and got them. This is the highlight of the meal. The beer was cold. After that, the waiter would meander by and mumble things like "Yokay?" and "Howboutmore?" before walking away, not waiting for a response. The food came, I had the Pollo Poblano, and I have never had a drier piece of chicken nor as flavorless a sauce. We get the check and...well, save yourself the money and buy a tank of gas to drive somewhere else to eat.
