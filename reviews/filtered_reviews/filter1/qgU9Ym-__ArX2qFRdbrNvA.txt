Been going to Sylvia's since she opened including her Cantina Mateos...sorry to see that both have gone downhill over the last year. Food quality has declined, service is horrible and the owner (Sylvia) regularly screams at her employees in sight of customers. As a result was easy to say goodbye to La Canasta - have found much better food and atmosphere at Armadillo Grill and 16th Street grill.
