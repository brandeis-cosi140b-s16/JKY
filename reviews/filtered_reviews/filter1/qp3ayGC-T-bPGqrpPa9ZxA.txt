This place makes me hate Mexican food. Everything is fried... bland and gross.

Don't expect to leave without adding 2,000+ calories to your daily diet.

I know that other people have raved about their $2 beer happy hours. This place is right off Mill Ave!! There are better happy hours and better beers all around Mill!

This place is the McDonald's in the ghetto version of a Mexican restaurant.
