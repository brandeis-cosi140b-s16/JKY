Service was absolutely horrible. The waiter barely spoke to us. I felt like I had to beg him to do anything. No one asked if we wanted water.. Had to flag the guy down. Then I made the mistake of ordering more chips and had to ask several times for the waiter to bring them out. When he finally did he looked annoyed w me. He never asked us how our food was. The final straw was when it came time to pay, I told him we were paying separate and then he let out this long sigh that included his lips flapping loud as if I asked him to do the hardest thing in the world. I didn't want to leave a tip.. Because that's how bad it was.. But ultimately I couldn't do that. I just won't come back. I didn't feel welcome in the first place.
