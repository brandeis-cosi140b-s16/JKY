We went for dinner with friends.   Everyone was extremely disappointed and we will not be back.   
I ordered tacos al carbon and was served roast beef.   Tacos al carbon means "grilled" meat...not roast beef.   When I thought I had the wrong plate (since it obviously wasn't "carbon") waiter looked at me crazy and said that was Tacos al carbon!  Even our friends, who wouldn't know the translation of their orders disliked the food.   Chips where from the supermarket, and salsa from a jar.
Very sad and disappointed...this restaurant is right around the corner from my house and we hoped we would have a new restaurant to frequent.
