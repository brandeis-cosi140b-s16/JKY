If Juan Jaime was from Mexico, he would be totally embarrassed to eat what they call Mexican in this Tacos and tequila joint. I ordered some tacos, one with carne asada, one with pork and one with chicken. You could not make a decent taco out of these three; no flavor, no juiciness,no taste whatsoever. The black beans were dry and tasteless so was the rice. Juan, if you can hear me , please tell your people they need to educate themselves on real Mexican food, after all it is your name that it is at stake!!!  A good place to go and familiarize with true authentic  Mexican food is Los Reyes de la torta. Mexican food at its best, I dare you Juan to check it out.
