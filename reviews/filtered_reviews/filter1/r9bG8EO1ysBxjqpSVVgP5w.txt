Terrible service. Manager (Omar) was unwilling to listen at all. Our food came out cold twice but the server never came back so we finally just ate the cold food. I'm local and I can tell you there are far better Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas. The prices were about double what I've seen and for that I would expect someone to care. We probably saw our server three times and we had to be the annoying people who asked other servers for drinks, forks, etc. I would suggest avoiding this place.
