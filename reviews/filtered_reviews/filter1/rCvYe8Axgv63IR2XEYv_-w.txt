If I could give this place zero stars, I would. This is by far the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Firstly, the horchata is made from a mix. As a result of this, it is chalky. Secondly, the nachos have that fake nacho cheese and round yellow chips, not anything remotely authentic or Mexican. The only okay thing was the meat. This was more like a cheap meal you would get at a theater; completely overpriced and shitty. I can see why it has late hours; only drunk people would classify this as a good meal. Anyone who has been to a real, authentic Mexican restaurant should proceed with caution.
