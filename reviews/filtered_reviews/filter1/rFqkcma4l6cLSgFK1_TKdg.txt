The atmosphere and service was nice, but the food was horrible. I had the #6 combo beef taco, beef enchilada and beef tostada. The salsa was nasty the chips had a burnt taste and the beef had no taste at all. After the third bite I was done. Hubby had the tacos al pastor. He made it through one taco and that was not good either. The soda and bean dip were good. The beans and rice on the combo plate were ok. Will not go back again
