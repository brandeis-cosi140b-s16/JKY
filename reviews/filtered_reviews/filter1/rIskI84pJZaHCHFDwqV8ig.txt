What a disappointment Javier's was. My family and I had dinner here this past Easter Sunday and although the decor was fabulous the food had no flavor and was cold on top of that. Like other reviews I've read the chips and salsa were definitely the only saving grace of Javier's. 
The service was neither here nor there just as our waiter. Although we didn't enjoy our experience at this vegas location we're planning on trying the ones in California and Cabo.
