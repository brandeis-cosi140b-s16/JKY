We ate here New Year's Day for dinner.  The server was rude when my daughter did not bring her id.  He told her if the "appetizer" she ordered was not enough as an entree, the soup could be brought out fast, but he never asked her again if she wanted the soup.  Her appetizer was over-cooked.  The rice that came with my chicken poblano was so over-cooked you could stick a fork in it and lift most of it up.  He brought me a new bowl of rice but I had to flag him down to get his attention.  The fried plantains were so over-cooked, they could not be cut with the knife.  I did not bother to ask for replacements.  My meal never should have left the kitchen. Some of the appetizer guacamole spilled on the table, but no one cleaned it up, although the server saw it, as did the water server.  The server was even cautious not to put the bill on it.  To top off the mediocre meal, they were out of the dessert we ordered, but the server didn't know it until he came back from the kitchen to tell us. It was just a disappointment.  We came from another resort to try this place because of the reviews. It just seemed like the place didn't care about the service or the food.
