I ordered a dozen tamales for Christmas a couple of days ahead of time and they did not have it ready. This was made worse by the fact that this was not for me but for the adopt-a-family program. The only thing the owner offered was for me to wait an hour or take my money back. She seemed annoyed that I was not happy with her options. Very, very disappointed with this restaurant
