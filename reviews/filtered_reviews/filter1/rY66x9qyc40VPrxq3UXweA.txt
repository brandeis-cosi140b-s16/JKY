So disappointed. This place is a robbery at gun point. Me and my boyfriend go out to eat once a week and we decided to choose this place for our New Years afternoon meal. First off, I should have taken warning to a Mexican food place with the name pub in it. The salsa tasted like bad pizza sauce. The decor is pathetic. And then the tamale I ordered was HORRID. I took 2 bites of it and couldn't believe how bad it was. I took it home and ended up giving it to a homeless person and felt bad he had to eat it. I can not figure out how this place has stayed in business and has 2 other locations. Once the check came the waitress rang up my order as a #4 instead of #14 which cost me $3 more. I was so over being there I just paid and left. I will never return here or recommend it.
