If you're looking for a Taco Bell like meal this is it... Only more expensive
Chili Rellanos greasy limp lacking flavor...
No blended frozen Margariras...Rice cold and  again no flavor....gacamole same no flavor....
Not worth the $$
Skip this restaurant Scottsdale has many more restaurants with a lot more going for them....
