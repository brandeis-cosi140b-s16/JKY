Never again! Paid way to much for 6 people. Over 100 dollars. 
First off, I've been here before this time and it was alright. The rice is gross. 
BUT decided to try it again because I like the albondigas. 
Secondly, we sit down and within TEN MINUTES my son has a HUGE black bug on his shoulder. We start freaking out and the waitress comes over and kills it and says oh it's just a light bug, we look up at the light and YUP there's a few bugs in there. Anyway we order because we already have all the kids settled and ready to eat. We get the food (not that great) eat and are ready for our receipts. Since we paid two ways, I was shocked to find out that for three people on one receipts was 53 dollars. No beers nothing, just food and soda. On the other receipts it was 54 dollars for three people. Crazy if you ask me. I'm so annoyed with this place after having a bug on my child I am shocked they wouldn't discount anything. THEN as we are leaving I ask the waitress for a refill on the 3 dollar small child sized apple juice and she said no, they don't refill juice. REALLY?!?!?! I'm never coming here EVER again, and refuse to let this go. Reported this to the health inspectors. YUCK!
