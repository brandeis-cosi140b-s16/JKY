The food is excellent in taste don't get me wrong... But let me tell you a little story about the incredible gastrointestinal pain you will go through after eating this. I hadn't eaten anything past its prime/ undercooked/ questionable for a long time before I've eaten there... I know because I had to trace my steps back with my doctors. I had eaten here and the next day I had the absolute WORST food poisoning I've ever gotten in my life hands down. I actually had to go to the hospital because I was in such pain and I had vomited all my fluids up. The doctors confirmed I'd eaten something pretty nasty. Friggin delicious food but definitely not if it means I'm going to be crouched over both a toilet and trash can for days.
