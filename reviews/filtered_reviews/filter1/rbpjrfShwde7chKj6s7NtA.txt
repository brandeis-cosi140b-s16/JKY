One star reviews are rare for me. This experience was horrible all around. It took 15 minutes to get a drink. I started to wonder if anyone was even working there after that amount of time. I ordered from the happy hour menu. The food arrived and it was incorrect. They eventually brought out the correct item. The side fries were caked in black pepper. The final bill was more expensive than the happy hour advertised online. Bummer.
