This place is a joke. My first and may I add only experience dinning here was revolting. Not only was my taco filled grisly fat, there was an added bonus the TIP OF A RUBBER GLOVE, I guess the chef thought it might add some much needed texture. My friend ordered fish tacos, but found it some what unappetizing that we were being served by a girl that resembled a Thai prostitute wearing nothing but a bathing suit, every time she spoke all I could just hear suckie suckie five dolla. When the drinks we ordered finally arrived I was surprised to find that the martini was nothing more than kool-aid with a splash of cheap bottom shelf vodka, something that would make even the cheapest college student gag. 

Conceptually this place is uninspired, Mexican Beach in the middle of the desert, in the middle of a strip mall. Genius, and let us open the doors the minute it is time to put on your jacket. 

Suffice it to say I did not order dessert since I had a belly full of rubber and povov, which quite possibly maybe a recipe for a gastro molotov cocktail.

As I made my much anticipated exit I had to make my way through a parade of under age girls in bathing suits and 10lbs of make-up. Who had been dancing erotically as i attempted to eat my meal. 

Word to the wise, if you find yourself in the vicinity of Coconuts, run and and never look back. Go to Yardhouse, or JIB(Jack in the Box) down the street. 


Tasteless, in every sense of the word.
