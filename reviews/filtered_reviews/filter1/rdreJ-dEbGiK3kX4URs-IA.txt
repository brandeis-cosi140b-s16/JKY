Would give less then a star if I knew how. my girlfriend had a meeting in the area so we decided to grab a quick dinner. chips and Salas were decent.  my girlfriends Margarita tasted like mountain dew and salt.  she got a cold Mexican pizza  and I got the chicken taco combination plate. My girlfriend didn't eat lunch, so she forced down a quarter of her frost bit meal. I took one bite of my taco, attempted to eat my rice and cheese soaked beans, but they tasted dirty.  I quickly ask for my check and 15 minutes later got to pay and leave.  Terrible Mexican food, terrible service, bar area or customers in bar area which I was force to sit in, although I stated I did not want to repeatedly, wreaked of smoke. Will never consider going back, would rather get a rat burrito from the taco bell across the street.
