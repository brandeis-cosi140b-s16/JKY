I ordered a carne asada burrito ($8) and it was terrible. A huge portion of the burrito was filled with rice!!! And a dab of tasteless refried beans with a few pieces of rough meat.. I'm not usually one to leave bad reviews, but in this case the constructive criticism is needed.. Everything else I ordered (some tacos and corn) was not good. 
Staff was friendly and attentive though..
