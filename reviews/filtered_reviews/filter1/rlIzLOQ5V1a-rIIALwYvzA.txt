If I could give this place zero stars I would. Walked in to place a to-go order. The lady who later said she was the manager took my order but told me she wouldn't send it to the kitchen until she took the payments of the people behind me. I patiently waited for 25 minutes. I ordered 2 burritos, a taco and a toatsda. I went up and asked about my order and it looked like she was getting someone to check on it. I asked why it was taking so long and she said it would take 15 MORE MINUTES!! She said they were busy but half their tables were empty. 

I told her 40 minutes is way too long for a togo order and I was leaving. She waved me off like she didn't care she was losing my business. No apology, nothing. 

DO NOT GO HERE
