Definitely a place to avoid.  Hopefully it is short lived.  Food actually used to be good, not any longer.  Prices are as other reviewers have noted, absurdly high.  Service is not good.  The salsa,,,bland.  And being the room is small and there were several business diners who have not the tact to keep their voices down, the place was deafening.  Guess one should take a clue as you walk in past dead and dying plants around the place that something has gone very wrong.  Hopefully, the next occupant will be observant of detail.
