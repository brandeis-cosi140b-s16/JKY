All in all an meh experience. The chicken was tasty and moist, but not really as flavorful as I would like.. The beef was just okay. I agree with everyone who says that the onions are way too salty. The beans are pretty bad actually, as is the salsa. It's worth it if you want to just come and pick up a chicken...
