For being a legend I would say that Ponchos is not up to par, nor do they have the best authentic Mexican food in south Phoenix. The albondigas soup that they make is always too salty, and the meatballs are never fully cooked. I've ordered the soup many times in hopes that it will be cooked and they fail every time. I always end up putting my soup in the microwave to completely cook the meatballs. The tacos are extremely greasy, and the restaurant needs renovating. The chips and salsa is about all I will eat. I've been asked by coworkers on where to go for great Mexican food and I always advise them to go to Comedor Guadalajara. Ponchos is NOT the bees knees and I would avoid it. Sorry but they just don't cut it.
