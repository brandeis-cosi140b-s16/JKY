Came here for a quick bite and got ice cold food with slow service and it was dead inside on a Friday night.  That should have told me something.  Nothing looked good on the menu but ordered anyways.  Wrong,  returned my food but lost my appetite by then and didn't want to try anything else.  Fyi, our food came out about 5 min after we ordered.  I don't think they actually cook it.  Must have been microwaved or in my case scooped out of the fridge. Good luck if you want to try it.
