Salsa taste like it was out of a can. Food had no favor. Didn't have soup on the lunch menu. I have never been to a Mexican restaurant where you couldn't order soup for lunch. Overpriced food. This place is a waste of time and money. Left this sorry place and went to Asian Fresh in the food court to get some good food. 

Rating: -5 stars and I wish that I had 4 hands so I could give it 4 thumbs down.
