Alright, I've been to Arribas before and it was always just "okay". However, this was the worst experience I have had before at any restaurant. 

I had a QT drink that I brought into the restaurant, not even thinking. Our server was getting off and we would have a new server. As I was in the restroom, I was informed by my friends that the new server tried reaching for my drink really awkwardly and they had no idea what was happening. They told him I was in the RR and would be back shortly. Right when I come out I'm getting bombarded by him telling me I can't have any outside food or drink. He was very flustered and you could tell he didn't really know how to handle the situation. I told him that it wasn't a big deal, handed over the drink and proceeded to sit down. 

Now, this wasn't the big deal. I felt that this situation was handled in the worst possible way. If this was such a big deal, the manager (who had greeted us and directed us where to sit) should have told me that I could not have the drink. By placing the responsibility and urgency on the server, he in turn got very flustered. I felt bad for the server.

We did not order any food and my friend paid for her drink. On our way out I talked to the manager.

This was the most unprofessional manager ever. He denied seeing us walk into the store. Would not listen to what I had to say, and turned the story so that it was the servers fault. This manager wouldn't even listen to me or my friends when we explained the situation! Very very horrible customer service. 

Needless to say, I will never be returning and I will not refer anyone here.

P.S. The menu has so many pictures nothing stands out. Everything looked the same and it was a very difficult menu to "read".
