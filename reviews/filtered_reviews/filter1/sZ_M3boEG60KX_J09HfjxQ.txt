Food is terrible - tastes like the cook is a smoker (too salty). Not very authentic either. Went one time for Happy Hour & figured I'd get a quesadilla along with my drink. Couldn't even finish that - it was just gross. Drinks are nothing to write home about either (although in all fairness, I don't usually do margaritas). Don't know why people come back here - we definitely won't!
