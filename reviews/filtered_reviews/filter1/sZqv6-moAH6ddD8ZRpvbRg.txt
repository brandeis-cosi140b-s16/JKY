I have wanted to try this place.  We went at 11:00 on Mother's Day.  The place was at least 80% empty.... both inside and outside.  We went to the hostess stand.  The woman said there would be at least a 30 minute wait because they were waiting for the 11 and 11:15 reservations to arrive.  Really??   They didn't know how many seats those reservations would take?  We will never go back.
