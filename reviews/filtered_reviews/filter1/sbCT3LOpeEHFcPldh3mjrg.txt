I gave it one star based on value for the money.  Had the Cuban sandwich that was very good but not 12 bucks worth of good and the fries were frozen so I got the plantain chips.  Red beans and rice were ok but nothing to write home about.   Wife got chicken cubano and it sure wasn't with 14 bucks with the fries. Very bland no garlic flavor as it stated on menu and slight lemon twang.  Pissed off about 40$ for lunch. Place was near empty during lunch so they are probably hurting.  But I can't get any idea of a reason to go back.  They seem to trying but it's not helping
