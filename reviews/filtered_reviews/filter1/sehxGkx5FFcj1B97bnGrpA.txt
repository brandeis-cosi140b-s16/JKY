I've been going here for years but have noticed in the past year or so a decline in the overall quality of the food and the service.

We asked the waiter to take it away and he came back to show us the can it came in? Okay. I know that can happen but if it does, the manager or owner should have come and something extra done, don't you think? It was taken off the bill. period. I had some of my husband's entree because I didn't want to slow down the rest of the meal.
My brother ordered a chicken dish and got enchiladas instead, by the time he had several bites and realized it-we were over it-
What happened Los Sombreros?
