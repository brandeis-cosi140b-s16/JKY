Terrible service. Mediocre food. Bad experience. Indifferent management. There are far too many good Mexican restaurants around to ever consider returning to this place. The waiter seemed to be dazed and confused. The manager could care less that we had an awful experience. Bottom line: we once liked it. Now, we wouldn't ever consider returning nor would we recommend it to anyone.
