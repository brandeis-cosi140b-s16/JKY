Food was okay nothing to rave about.  Sorry to say not authentic Mexican food.  Typical Mexican food served at a Mannys or Macayos.  Hostess not very friendly, servers said we could not order from her, it had to be from waitor/waitress.  Instead of saying "Let me get her/him for you" she walked away.  More attention needs to be paid to cleaning as restaurant was dirty, walls very dirty.  Pretty sure I will not be coming back.
