Second time at this place and the food is just lack luster as last time. The Piled High Nachos were dry as a bone and the chips were burnt! The small amount of cheese they provided had solidified by the time they got to the table. The shredded beef tasted of nothing and was dried the f**k out! How could they screw up such a simple dish. I'm trying to have a good time with friends and that sad pile of nachos was too depressing to look at. I told them to take it back. I won't even get into the service it wasn't terrible, but why bother.

I'm coming to realize that  Mexican food served on the Vegas Strip does not do any one any favors. Everyone thinks Mexican food should be good, priced fairly and served in an adequate portion. Fast service and free chips and salsa are just par for the course. El Segundo Sol never scores high in any of the categories. Ever!

I heard of a happy hour and the bartender said it's only outside at Stripburger (same company) in the cold, dreary rain. She actually recommended we sit outside in the cold rain by heat lamps! What's wrong with people?
