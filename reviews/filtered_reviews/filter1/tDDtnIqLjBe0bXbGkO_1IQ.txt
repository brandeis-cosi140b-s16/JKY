DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY $$

So it's My turn to pick where we would eat. Big frog grabbed my attention so we went for it. service was slow and restaurant wasn't that busy so dont know why it took 15 minutes for a server to come take our order. Finally ordered drinks and food. After waiting 15 minutes to order it took another 15 minutes just for our drinks to arrive because they decided to call up our server on stage to do some dances? Really? But anyways..finally got our Drinks and yes they were WAY overpriced for the amount of alcohol in em. And as for the Food it was gross,tasteless and left my stomach feeling not so great. In the end friends were upset i had chosen this lovely establishment.. and to top it off i just found out that they are the reason for the tequila bar ISLA closing down. So That upset me, but really its only a matter of time before something else is set to replace se√±or frog.

WONT BE BACK!
