Very disappointed in this restaurant. I took a friend here today for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. It was around 1:45. I was looking forward to a salad and she some mexican food. When we walked in there was a wait in the dining room. So we sat in the bar area. It wasn't busy but I could tell they were under staffed. (Should have been better prepared, after all the TPC tournament's only been here in Scottsdale for 30 years!)
So we sat. And we sat and we sat. I noticed that the couple across from us  hadn't been waited on but a couple that came in after us had chips and salsa and water on their table. The owner acknowledged the couple next to us and said "i'll be right with you folks" He then came over took their drink order, took their food order at the same time, grabbed their menu's and never said a word to us! The other servers walked past us as if we were invisible. For the owner to be so blatantly rude is inexcusable! He should have handed us the menu's from the table he just took the order from, apologized to us for the wait and at the very least gotten us our drinks! 
We got up and left and went to THE OFFICE BAR on 116th street . It was busy, we were waited on immediately, when it continued to get more busy the bartender came from behind the bar and helped out, took orders delivered food and drinks. Maybe Michael should take a lesson from The Office on customer service !  I quit going to the Blue adobe  about 5 years ago because of his rudeness, I recently started going back in when I had family in town. The food and service was good. But I've decided not to patronize this place ever again, there are too many nice restaurants in the area where you are welcomed and treated with respect.
