My burrito was not good. I had a wet burrito. No bueno. Fish tacos were so wet that it made the soft she'll like rubber. So much cilantro that you couldn't taste the fish. My fianc√© had a chicken quesadilla and she took 2 bites and tossed it. We had ours delivered so we couldn't send it back. The plus is that they deliver. I wouldn't recommend this place.
