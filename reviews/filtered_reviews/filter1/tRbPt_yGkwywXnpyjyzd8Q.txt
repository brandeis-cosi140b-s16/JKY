My husband and I usually LOVE senor frogs (whenever we go on vacation) so we decided to come here for his birthday.  WAY overpriced.  It was $400 for 3 people.  The "yard" glasses have a game in the bottom so they don't have to fill up.  The place is way too loud- even for senor frogs.  The waitstaff were not engaging.  I'd suggest going to Kahunaville downstairs instead.
