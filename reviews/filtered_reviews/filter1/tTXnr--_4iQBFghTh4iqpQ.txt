I used to love Cabo, but I think they've gotten too big for their britches.  Our most recent visit paired rude, lackluster service with mediocre food.

It started when they forgot about us for 45 minutes.  We were wondering why our food was taking so long, when our waitress popped over to tell us that "the printer hadn't printed" our order, so we had fallen behind.  I am not sure whether that was the truth or not, but when one of our party (half-jokingly) asked if they were going to adjust our bill, she made some snide little joke about all she could do was keep our water glasses filled.  And guess what--she didn't even do that!

When the food finally came, it was pretty bland, and the portions were very small for the price they charge.  I didn't want to pig out, but I left hungry. 

Other small annoyances: 
-the hostess who sat us was quite rude, at one point informing us that we needed to move because we were "in the way."  Ok, that's reasonable, but that's not how you talk to a customer.  You ask nicely or at least say excuse me.  
-The board listing their specials was a night old, so we tried to order things that weren't available.  The waitress looked at us like we were stupid before we pointed out their mistake.
-It's loud.  Almost too loud for a bar, and definitely too loud for a restaurant where, you know, you might want to be able to talk with your companions.

I was very disappointed with Cabo this time around... I don't think I'll be back.
