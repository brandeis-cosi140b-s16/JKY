I'm not a huge gambler but I'll put $100 in throughout the night when I go somewhere. Me and 2 friends went in and had a total of 6 drinks between all of us and two orders of tacos and a quesadilla. Tacos were good but the chicken quesadilla came out as all sauce and peppers, very little cheese or chicken. The bartender grabbed me another that was considerably better than the first. Because of this the bartender said,"This drink is on me"... I was appreciative of this... But other than this I saw the bartender on his personal phone taking a call 3 times and didn't seem to care when I had a cash out ticket waiting at all. Like I said, I'm not a huge gambler but I put in a total of $100 and playing blackjack went up and down quite a bit while playing. The check comes, all drinks were charged for except for the one,"He took care of..." Many better gaming spots to go to than this, good service and gaming is found elsewhere...
