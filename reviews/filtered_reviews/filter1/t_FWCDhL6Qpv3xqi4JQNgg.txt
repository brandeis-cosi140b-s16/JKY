I went there with my husband last night,  Saturday, may 15th. The restaurant ambiance is totally cool! Great southwest , mexican decor. After we were seated, we ordered a beer & a margarita. They finally arrived about 10- 15 minutes later! We had been enjoying their great salsa & chips, figuring we were really going to like this place!
   The menu is pretty limited. We ordered a bowl of chicken tortilla soup & the beef fajitas to share. I was not famished,  and figured there would be plenty. 
    Now, they came out together, which was okay, since we were sharing. But, they brought a cup of soup instead of a bowl. That cup of soup cost $4.99, and was smaller than a small coffee cup! Neither of us liked it, either.  The fajitas that were supposed to come sizzling were just warm, and the meat was dried and cooked pretty well. The meat would have actually been good if cooked right. The portion was very small, and the tortillas that came to wrap the food in, were about the size of a drink coaster!! Also, I was pretty bummed that my margarita had absolutely no alchohol in it. 
      The server was really nice, but we will not go back there.
