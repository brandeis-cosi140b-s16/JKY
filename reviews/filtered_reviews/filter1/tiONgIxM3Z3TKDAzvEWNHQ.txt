I don't know how this place got these reviews! Look at the tables graute how dirty and black it is. This place stinks really bad. The food is not authentic Mexican food, you can tell its out of a can or box. The tamales were reheated several times and did not have a good flavor. You can tell how old a Tamal by the leaf
