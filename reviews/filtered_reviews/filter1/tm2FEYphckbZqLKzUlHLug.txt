Came here before an ASU game, it was slammed.  Sat in the bar at a pub table and was not waited on, had to go to the bartender after 15 minutes and told him what pub table I was sitting at.  He was pleasant and under the circumstances, no fault to him the place was spread thin.  So he had to come out from the bar to help serve, it was a given our plates wouldn't be picked up cuz the bar was busy.  The carne asada tacos were just ok, not much flavor, I did like the beans veggies.  Horrible ownership and management for something like this to happen.  The service was as bad as I ever had, again not by the server, but there was not waitresses or waiters, never heard such a thing.
