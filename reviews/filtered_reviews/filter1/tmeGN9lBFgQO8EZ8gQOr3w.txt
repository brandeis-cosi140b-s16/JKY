1st off, the AC apparently does not work causing everyone there including the waitress to sweat profusely.   Then our service just topped off the bad experience.  Our waitress showed up within minutes of being seated and we ordered just waters to drink...sounded good since it was so hot in there.  Well, just over 10 minutes later a busboy notices we are still waiting for our waters so asks what we ordered and immediately gets them for us.  5 minutes later our waitress finally comes back and takes our order.  Another server then brings us our food.  It's not busy at all in the restaurant so not sure what our waitress is doing but it's definitely not helping us.  The 3rd and final time we saw her, was to bring us our bill.  The food was good but not good enough to go back get that service again.
