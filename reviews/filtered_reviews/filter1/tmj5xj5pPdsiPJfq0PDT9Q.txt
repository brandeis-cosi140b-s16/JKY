We've tried to find a decent margarita in the Pinnacle Peak area for 14 years and now  must finally conclude that one does not exist. We returned to Jalapeno's after avoiding it mostly over the years, choosing instead to head to Cantina Laredo to the south or to Carefree/Cave Creek. The house margarita was poured into a tumbler- sized glass and as a result you could barely taste any tequila. Their mix is pretty bad. We ordered a shot to share that spruced it up, but asked for "something affordable" suggesting Herradura, which is usually cheaper. The server was clueless and the small shot cost $9. We decided to try the Sangria Swirl instead and it was unbelievably bad and undrinkable. The server didn't care that we were not finding any satisfaction with the cocktails. I would say that if you like green corn tamales and don't need a margarita, this isn't a bad place to visit.  

Update - I see by the manager's response I just have my facts wrong! Well there you have it. I'm sure that the many tourists that frequent this place wouldn't know what a proper margarita is supposed to taste like.  Why not simply offer your customers to have those "almost two ounces of tequila" served in a smaller glass instead of swimming in a 16 oz tumbler of sweet mix?  How about...hold on...serving it in a margarita glass!
