The worst service - so slow - over 5 minutes just to get a menu, another 5 to get drinks then another 15 just to get food.  Oh wait we never got our food because the server said I had to be patient (translation: you're going to get your food whenever its ready).  We finally walked out since we never got anything.  Never again
