My wife and I were regular customers here( 2-3 per week) till a few months ago.  We were shocked to see signs being posted throughout the restaurant. The owner seems more concerned about pennies than dollars.  We have never felt so unwelcome to a place. We felt we would try again this weekend to see if things have gotten better. To our surprise, it has gotten worse! A red letter sign on the front door about outside drinks with the statement," and don't even ask."  It just turned us away. This place was almost always packed for breakfast. There was 4 cars in the parking lot this morn.  Sad to see a business slowly failing over trivial things. Food was always good. :-(
