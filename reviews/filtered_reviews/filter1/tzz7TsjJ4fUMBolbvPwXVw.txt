Great place if you like mushy, soggy, undercooked mexican food.  The tortillas are terrible.  You can find better at frys.  The enchiladas suck. The cheese inside wasnt even melted. The chili relleno plate, my favorite mexican dish, was soupy!  How the hell can chili relleno be SOUPY???  Literally when i was done there was an inch of juice on my plate.  Oh and drink your soda slowly because it will take 30 minutes to get refilled.
