Stop by this place on a Saturday night.  The place was nice, the atmosphere was good, and our waiter was on top of our refills.  

The bad, our waiter took our order but forgot to place it to the cook, so it took about 20mim to finally get our food.  When our food finally came out, my plate was totally the wrong plate.  At this point the waiter and manager offer to get me what I had order but I did not feel like waiting another 10-20 min for the plate I had originally order.  
I would try it again but this night I left very disappointed that I did not get the food I order.
