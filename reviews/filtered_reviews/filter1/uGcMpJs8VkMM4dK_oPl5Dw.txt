This restaurant is so close to home I thought I'd give it another chance. Had not been there in years. Now I remember why. The service was surly. My husband said something to the manager and now we both have stomach cramps. I wonder if he did something to our food? The pina colada was watered down and tasted bitter. The fish tacos were OK, but the roasted corn that came with it was odd. I don't think I'll be going back any time soon.
