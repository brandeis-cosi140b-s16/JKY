Seriously overrated! We have been to Richardson's once before and had a pleasant experience. This time around was completely different and have to say will not ever be back. A 2 hour 10 minute disaster! First server warned us of the 16 min garlic platter which was fine, we were excited to try it. Didn't realize she also waited to put our order in until after we ate it. With 11 people on the patio (4 kiddos) at 108 degrees with misters they turned off on us after sitting down for 10 mins...it's a no brainier to grab the manager for an explanation. Well, that didn't happen because the mgr left for the Dicks last Resort location??? It is Friday night, is it not??? So the kitchen lost our ticket was the explanation and when the mgr showed his face he decided to give us a 12% discount on our evening. Sorry, not good enough! Too many other great choices in the area to go back again. Blahhhh!!!! Server was sweet...not her fault...just inadequate management!
