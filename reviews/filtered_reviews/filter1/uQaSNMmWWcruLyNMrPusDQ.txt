I came here last week to try out the huevos rancheros that my dad and sister claimed to love. I had been to New Mexico Grill once before for an ok bean burrito so I figured the huevos rancheros would be a safe bet.

Much to my dismay, neither the red or green sauce was vegetarian. My only other options were a quesadilla or bean burrito so I went with another burrito. Again, it was ok. I used lots of the thin, red salsa to add some spice. I was very disappointed with their salsa verde though. Normally I prefer it to red, but theirs was so bland.

To my father's dismay, the rice wasn't ready yet so he couldn't sub the potatoes with it like he usually does. I don't blame him since the breakfast potatoes are just disgusting. I'd bet dollars to donuts that the flavorless cubes come straight from a freezer bag. I'm not sure why the rice wasn't ready yet just like I couldn't understand why they didn't have chips out either. 

What really angered me about this place is how I was treated when I asked for corn tortillas for my husband's chorizo scramble. My husband is newly gluten intolerant, and he forgot to ask for corn tortillas instead of flour (maybe it would have been helpful if the cashier asked). When I asked for the corn tortillas, the cashier wanted to charge me $2.59 for three small tortillas! It's ridiculous for two reasons: 1. I'm sure they buy them from Food City for $1/dozen like I do. They definitely aren't made in house. 2. Why can't they show a little customer courtesy by happily giving us a substitution? Instead, the manager demanded that I bring him back the unused flour ones before he would replace them. Why? Was he planning on serving them to someone else?

After this terrible treatment, I won't be the least bit sorry if this place goes out of business. They must be having financial troubles if they are cutting this many corners.
