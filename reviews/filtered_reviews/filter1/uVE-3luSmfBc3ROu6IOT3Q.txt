Ben here several times
I really love spicy food of any ethnicity
Use ghost chili sauce at home
However I could not eat the farmers burrito it was so spicy
The waitress removed from the bill and offered a replacement but the wife was already done
Probably won't go back and that's a shame because the ambiance is better than most Mexican restaurants
