Worst choice in Scottsdale! The server was beyond rude, it took us almost two hours to eat out dinner, the table side guacamole was gross and the server was one of the worst I have ever had. The food was overpriced for what you get, go to Baja Fresh and you get the same food... Actually twice as much for half the price.
