I wish I could give a zero star review...If you are looking for a local, small town business with an owner who appreciates the town and cares for her customers, RUN THE OTHER WAY!!!! As a long time customer, 25+ years to be exact, my family lived for Friday nights spent at Encanto.  After the wonderful owner passed, his money hungry daughter took the reins and lost our business forever. The food, atmosphere, and events have ALL lost their luster. As a customer, I've only seen the prices skyrocket while the quality of the food drops and the portions shrink. Also, if ever thinking of having an event at the restaurant in downtown Cave Creek, STOP, and think again. My brother had a horrible experience with the "event planner" who didn't even show up the night of his wedding. A cash bar was present when the bride asked for it to be only alcohol she purchased, and afterwards, the owner took it upon herself to degrade the groom's family and take their concerns personally, and lash out, rather than deal with them professionally. It saddens me to have lost a wonderful place to eat, however, the Encanto I knew and loved left with the original owner.
