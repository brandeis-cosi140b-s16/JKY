Way over-priced. I hate the feeling of being gypped. That's how I felt after eating at China Poblano. It's pricey and food was blah to say the least. We ordered the Happy Family Potstickers $13 for 6 pieces. The frozen bag from my local Asian market tasted way better. We also ordered the Ten Treasure Soup $18 - can you say bland? The last thing we ordered was When Pigs Fly - $14 for a small steamed bun with bbq pork - tasty but so small, it was gone in three bites. For these prices, I would have been OK if taste was good, but we were neither satisfied, nor happy. We actually had to eat a couple slices of pizza after just to feel full. I'm not a big girl - 5'2" and 110 pounds. Are you paying for the name of the chef or a meal?? Nope. We're not going back - EVER!
