The food may be good, but I wouldn't know since this place asked me to wait for over two hours to be seated for a table for three.  To be fair, we went in on a Friday night around 7:00 with no reservation.  There were quite a few people waiting for tables and the restaurant was overflowing with people.  I placed my name in with the hostess and was informed it would be a 45-55 minute wait.  Fair enough - seems like a reasonable amount of time to wait on a Friday with no reservations. We wasted time by walking around Scottsdale Quarter and having a juice drink at True Food. We ventured back to Sol and were able to find a spot at the bar.  I had the skinny margarita, which was tasty enough, but nothing special. My guy had the house margarita and he said it was average.  After an hour of waiting, I went to check on our table. The hostess said it would be another 25 minutes for our table to be ready.  We were enjoying the people watching, but growing hungry nonetheless. We decided to wait sice we had already waited this long.  After another 35 minutes, my beau, who is not as rational as I am, went to speak to the hostess and was told it would be yet another half hour. At this point we were looking at a two hour wait with no end in sight. How could we trust them not to ask us to wait another 30 minutes? We left, but not before my cranky guy chewed out the manager. Maybe you could chalk this up to the growing pains of a new restaurant, or the inability of a young staff to properly gauge the wait and manage their tables, but my experience left me thoroughly disappointed and I will not be going back to try the food any time soon.
