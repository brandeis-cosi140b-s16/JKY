So excited for the cute lil patio. Waited 40 minutes for a queso dip appetizer, another hour after for our chimichangas. They were just full of excuses too. Offered us a whopping 10 percent discount. Wow thanks. This was a second chance for my company who had the same problem the time before. Won't waste the time or money to come back. Every table on the patio was complaining. They weren't that busy and that kind of food is already prepped. Ugh.
