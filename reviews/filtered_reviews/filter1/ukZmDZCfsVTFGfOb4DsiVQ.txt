I ate there Friday, December10th, 2010 and went with friends who raved about the place and know the owner.  They were right -- the food was absolutely wonderful.  However, we were seated right beneath the speaker in the main room and when the two local musicians started singing and playing, it was PAINFULLY loud!  We couldn't hear each other talk.  We asked our nose-in-the-air waiter to have it turned down three different times, but he and the manager wouldn't do it.  The owner wasn't there that night and they weren't at all interested in helping us.  I don't care how good your damn food is, I'll never go back.  Your customer service is nonexistent.
