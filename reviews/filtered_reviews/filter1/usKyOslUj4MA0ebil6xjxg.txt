I give this place one star because it wasn't the absolute worst restaurant experience I've had. The bartender was cordial at least, once he realized we existed. We came in tonight , New Year's Eve and entered right as it was clearing out.  Ie: most had gotten or were finished with their meals.  They were not busy and being directly across from jobing.com, they should be prepared for game nights and new years.  (Having worked at a restaurant next to a sporting arena, I am aware of how this works.) Long story short, 1 order of not good chicken tacos took a half hour, our taquitos were completely forgotten, the employees were wandering around on their cell phones; that's if you can tell who works there, as they all wear street clothes. These people either don't know what they're doing, or they don't care because they're guaranteed business when all the edible places are busy.  I will never go here again and dissuade anyone I know to do so either.
