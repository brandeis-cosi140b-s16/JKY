This place is horrible unless all you want to do is drink alcohol.
Nothing but poor service and poorly cooked food. We were not greeted upon entering and had to tell them that we wanted to be seated. We were then brought to a dining room that had ball of the ambience of a school hall with plastic table clothes included. Our server was not even closely familiar with the food or food preparation. When asked how the fideo was prepared, she said, "they cook it".  Thanks captain obvious. My husband asked if there was anything spicy and she said the steak and jalapeño fajitas were. He then asked if anything else was and she said "Well, the steak and jalapeño fajitas are".....she does not belong waiting on people. 
So the food. The food is microwaved!! Soggy, gross enchilada, mushy and dry tamale, lackluster salsa, fideo that had been in a steam pan since yesterday. The highlight was the almost average fajitas. 
No bueno !
