The best thing and truest thing I can say about Nacho Daddy is that the food is consistently INCONSISTENT. 
You just don't know what you are gonna get especially when you alway order your favorite items. We stopped going there. Just got tired of not getting what you thought you went there for. 
We just came here tonight hoping that perhaps it had changed...but NO. It was a disappointment. Service is always good but the food really isn't.  Sorry to say.
