DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT EAT HERE!!This place is GOD AWFUL!!! The service was pathetic. Me and my friend came to get some food and a drink to kill time because Southwest (which is an awful airline as well) got delayed. We were seated and me and my friend waited 15 mins for a waiter/waitress to take our order.  We were purposely overlooked and when we got up to leave, the waitress snatched our menus off the table to seem as if she was making a a statement. We don't know what we did to piss her off, but I guess when you have shitty airports, with a shitty airlines I guess it must be accompanied by a shitty restaurant such as Barrio Cafe Airport. As For the costs of their food and the attitude displayed, it is not worth A DIME to eat here unless you are in to evil waitresses and expensive shitty burritos
