Biggest loss on the strip!

I was very frustrated when I visited Carlos and Charlies with my girlfriend last weekend. They were offering a $20 open bar wristband so we figured, Why not? We paid our 40 bucks to get in and were handed a red cup. As any young couple might, we headed straight to the bar. I ordered a margarita and she had a vodka pineapple. I almost gagged when I sipped mine and she couldn't finish hers either. Frustrated, I returned to the bar to try and recoup our combined losses by ordering shots, That was strike two. I totally get that bars have low budget, well drink specials but I didn't have the stomach to even attempt my second round. What was strike 3 you ask? The fact that the bartender took everyone elses order before mine once he saw that I hadn't left him a tip on top of our 40 entrance fee. I'm a great tipper usually, but not for failing service at a rock bottom level.

Carlos and Charlies= most you'll spend for the worst drinks imaginable. Don't gamble with this one, you'll lose...
