you know when you are buzzed and happy w/ your group and looking for some tasty mexican food....well lets just say not even being happy & buzzed made up for the food.
it started off w/bad  service a waitress who walked away while taking your order, never making eye contact, looking like she was trying to break a kgb code.  it is a simple menu with not much of a selection i paid $16 for hard rice, cold beans that tasted like they were sitting on a counter in a pot ALLLLLL day and two tacos that were also cold with tuff steak (if my dog delilah was there i would thrown the meat under the table) anyhow all i kept thinking was who ef ups a taco???? i would have paid $20 for 1 taco from King Taco or JackinBox.  i picked tacos because the rest of the menu wasnt even appealing, they try too hard to be "baja" they are way off  although it does smell like a bar on revolution boulevard in Tijuana,  the drinks are super expensive too but even if you have money dont expect a waitres to keep em coming. anyhow if you are looking for good mexican food, please dont go here.  but for those of you who are interested in tequila shots w/the worm go for it.....peace out
