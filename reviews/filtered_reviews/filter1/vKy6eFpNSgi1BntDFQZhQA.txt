Made reservations for a wedding reception a month and a half ago for a party of 40 at 9pm.  We arrived at 8:15pm and have been waiting to get seated!  The tables are not ready &  ow they are saying until 9:30pm!  This is ridiculous!  Never again will I come here and to top it off, the food is pricy & not even that great!
