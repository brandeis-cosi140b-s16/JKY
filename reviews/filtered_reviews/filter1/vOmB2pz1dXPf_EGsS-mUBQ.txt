Worst service ever!!! Took 20 minutes for the waitress to even get to our table. Bartender obviously doesn't know what a mojito is because she/he tried twice. Tamale bites were undercooked and had part of the husks in them. Also overheard 3 other tables around us that had their orders messed up. We were there over an hour and still hadn't even gotten our food so we left. We will never be going here again.
