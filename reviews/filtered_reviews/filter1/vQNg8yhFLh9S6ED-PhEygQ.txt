Saw this place on Yelp so thought I would give it a try, sorry I did. The salsa is one of the worst I have ever tried. People in the rest of my party were also very displeased with their entrees to say the least. Ordered a cocktail, which the waitress just raved about, why I don't know. Was basically a kool-aide drink in a cocktail glass. But here lies my biggest problem. Started with the guacamole, chips and salsa. Not the best but eatable. Here comes my entree, OMG. I thought I was going to die! Literally! Two bites or so and I start feeling queasy. And I mean this crap won't stop. So I take a trip to the rest room and figure I will let it pass. But my stomach says different. I started throwing up there proceeded to come home and couldn't stop until every little thing I had eaten at that God forsaken place was out of my system. Will I try it again? I say not. When I told the waitress about the incident she was very nice and quite apologetic. The other women that was called over never introduced herself and was quite rude. Offered to take it off my bill and that was that. By the way I ordered plate # 2 with a green tamale al a cart. I still feel queasy just thinking about it. Good thing there were no great smells or aromas or I probably would not be able to eat this combo any where else either. And to think I went there with such great expectations. I wish that woman, whom ever she may be, would have been courteous. Then maybe I might think of giving them another, try not. Lol.
