Really disappointed with this place. Walked in and waitress looked bugged That I even walked in. Not friendly at all. After a good while of sitting down (nobody telling me seat yourself) the waitress came over. When I was telling her my order she was trying to walk away. I ordered a steak burrito which was horrible. Wish I would have known it was this bad and should have gone to Burger King were the staff looks friendly.
