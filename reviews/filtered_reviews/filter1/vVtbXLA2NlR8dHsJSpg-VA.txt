The food is decent, albeit spicy. The Kick-Ass Margaritas pack a whollop! 

A few weeks ago we went there and it was a great experience. Reese was our waiter and he was attentive and friendly. I gave that visit a 5 star rating. 

However, last night was horrible and I'm pissed we spent $80 for two of us. We sat on the patio (because the live music inside was awful and too loud). They sat us on one side of the patio that was so dark I had to use my phone to light the menu and to see my meal. And the fun began- immediately adjacent to the patio there was a crew using a loud pressure washer to clean the kitchen floor mats. That lasted the entire time we were eating our meal. We had to yell over the motor noise. We told the waiter (as did other patrons) how obnoxious the noise was but there was nothing done to stop it. 

I agree with other reviewers- the iPad payment system is awkward and tacky.

Overall: Good food- if you like spicy- but get it to go. I won't be back.
