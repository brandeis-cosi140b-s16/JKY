We were treated rudely upon entering by one waitress, she seemed annoyed we had a nine year-old with us.

We had a ninety minute layover, had once been to Sammy's in Cabo, figured we had liked it in Mexico, how bad could it be?

It was worse than bad.

The burger patty was the quality you might expect at Smart 'N Final. We asked the waitress if the hot dog was "normal size" or one of those extra large varieties, she replied, "Oh, it's just a small, normal sized hot dog"

This thing was huge, would make John Holmes blush!

Bartender had no clue what was meant by a "vodka straight up". How the hell can you tend bar and not know what "straight up" means?

Two cocktails, one burger, one hot dog, one quesadilla, chips and guacamole, $108.00!!

Money would have been better spent in a slot machine and I don't gamble.
