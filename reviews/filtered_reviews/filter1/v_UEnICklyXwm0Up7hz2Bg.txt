Queso fundido was  plastic, tasteless mess.   Shrimp diablo was hot.   We were warned but it bordered on inedible and we like spicy food.  Shrimp fajitas,  in contrast,  had no spice.   Had me looking for the salt and pepper.  Empanadas were good.   Service was ok but had to ask repeatedly for sour cream.   Meal was not worth $25 per entree.
