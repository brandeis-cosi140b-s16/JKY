Very poor service and their tacos tasted like corn tortillas.  You had to load them up with salsa for flavor.  Salsa selection is nice as in the patio seating.  Makes sense for happy hour but the beer i had from the tap was pretty flat.  Really not much good to reference here except the salsas.  Unfortunately that is not something you can build a restaurant on.
