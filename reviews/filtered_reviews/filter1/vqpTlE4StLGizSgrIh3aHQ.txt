Sorry folks, this isn't working.  We tried a variety of dishes from the menu and nothing was more than meh.  Barely there, uninspired and overpriced for quality and quantity.  Plus, our server was one of those folks that maybe should be working in computers, not hospitality.  Beautiful patio, too bad the food doesn't measure up.  That said, we tried Barrio Cafe at the airport and had a rockin' meal with great, albeit slightly wack, service.  Quality control folks or maybe the Scottsdale crowd just doesn't know the difference :)...
