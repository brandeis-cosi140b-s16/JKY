The hostess was anything but nice. Wouldn't even acknowledge us while she counted money and receipts. There was a table open right in front of the door and she made us wait 15 minutes while she finished. 
The server was the best part she understood we were hungry and brought us food and drinks as fast as she could.  It's not her fault the music was loud and horrible, and that our food was greasy and gross. Left her a good tip even though our ears were ringing and our stomachs hurt when we left.
