We'd walked by the restaurant to peek in and talk to the girl out front about a menu and any questions we had. A friend asked if they used lard in their refried beans, but she said she didn't know. He asked about vegetarian/vegan options on the menu, she didn't know.

We made the mistake of going in the next day for lunch. Awful service and high prices and the music was a little loud. I was in with a large party that got seated fairly promptly and just as promptly ignored. No contact past the door. The restaurant was barely half full and there were clearly wait staff that weren't really all that busy. 

The food I saw around the room was tiny portions, especially for the high prices. I wasn't keen on paying ~$8 for a bottle of Corona. Go here if you hate service and yourself and if you like spending a lot of money on being cool. After about 15-20 minutes of no contact from the staff, our party marched out.
