We had a bachelorette and birthday party on Saturday. The food was awful!! Nothing like true authentic Mexican food at all!!! And the music was not Mariachi music! It was punk rock which is odd for a Mexican themed restaurant! I mean that is why people like to try different types of cuisine for the ambiance and atmosphere!!!! Not to mention one of my friends used her credit card and an hour later somebody had charged music on her account because she received 2 alerts from her bank!!!!! I won't be back!!!!
