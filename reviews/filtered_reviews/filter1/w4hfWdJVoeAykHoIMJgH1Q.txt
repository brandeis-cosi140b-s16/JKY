The worst nachos I have EVER had. I make better nachos at home. We were waiting for a band to start at the stage outside of the restaurant. So we found a great spot and decided to order food. My husband ordered chicken nachos and I ordered the "drunk shrimp" on the appetizers. There were 6 shrimp, deep fried in a basket with a dipping sauce. I am not sure what flavor the sauce was but it was kinda like an orange creamy something. Anyway, not much flavor. The shrimp werent bad. 
Our server was really attentive and nice. But the nachos were just awful. Hubby had two beers and I ordered a coke which was watered down. We also ordered chips and salsa. The salsa was nasty. Not flavorful or hot. And it was really thin, not like something you could actually dip your chips in. $31 later we left hungry. 
I would never choose this place again.
