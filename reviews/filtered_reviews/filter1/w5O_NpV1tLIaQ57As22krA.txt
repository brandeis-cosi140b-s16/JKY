The service was ok.  No refills because the server never came back after the meal was delivered.  Forgot our appetizer, but got it lickety split after we got our meal.  I had the Nogada.   Fabulous but not worth $24 for a chili relleno in white sauce.  My son had the Azteca..bad pork for $19.  The tortillas are the size of sand dollars.  I would recommend it if the price was cut in half.  Not worth the price.   Of course both dishes were the "recommended" dishes...also the most expensive.
