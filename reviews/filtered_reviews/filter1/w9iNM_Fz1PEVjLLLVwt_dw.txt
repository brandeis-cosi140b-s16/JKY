I wish I would've read the reviews before going last night with my friends. The place looked pretty cool and had an ok vibe, music was pretty good also but the service was HORRIBLE let me repeat my self it was HORRIBLE the waitress rolled her eyes at me when I order my drink. Did not smile once and gave me a really bad attitude. She looked like she didn't want to be there and to top it off my girlfriend came up and order a margarita and she didn't even acknowledge her. I went and told two other staff and they just said ok like they didn't even care. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER AND I COME TO VEGAS ONCE A MONTH. NEVER GOING BACK. HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED.
