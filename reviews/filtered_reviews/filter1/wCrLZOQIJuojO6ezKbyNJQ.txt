Don't waste your time! I have absolutely nothing positive to report about this restaurant. While it may have been only this location, the service, food and prices were atrocious!!! My server disappeared after taking my order, the replacement disappeared after bringing out our food. My order was wrong and I couldn't find my new server to get it fixed, much less a simple refill on my drink.
The hostess, blew me off when I asked for my server and said she should be out soon... 20 mins later I got the check... 35 bucks for two meals that were cold and soggy... Oh and never did get that refill..,

FYI I gave one star because it wouldn't let me give less....
