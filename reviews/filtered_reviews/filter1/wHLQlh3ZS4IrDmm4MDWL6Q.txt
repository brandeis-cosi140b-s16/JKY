Worst experience of my life. The food was delicious even though it was bite sized portions.  First we sat down on the couches and ordered, 45 minutes later our food came, we asked the runner for silverware, chips, and water since our waiter didn't bring us any. The runner never returned with anything so we flagged down another waiter. We asked the second waiter for our check. He told us that we couldn't use our groupon because it was happy hour, it was 8, and happy hour is from 4-6:30. He went to go talk to the manager for another 20 minutes,  he returns with a check that overcharges us 20 dollars, and once again had to send it back. 
just getting the check took 45 minutes.
