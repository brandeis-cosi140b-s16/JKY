This place is filthy.  It isn't just a dive, it makes a Tijuana jail look clean.  I travel often and I have eaten in dumps all over the planet and this place is in the top 5 most disgusting.

This food will mess up your stomach.  I still have it sitting in my stomach 21 hours later.  Not to mention the fact that I think the wife got food poisoning. 

The wife had the jade red chicken and the chile relleno with the jerk rice and refried beans.  The jade red chicken was dry, the chile relleno was covered in crackers and the chile was raw, and the beans tasted like they came from a can.

I had the diablo chicken, jade red chicken, jerk rice, and refried beans.  Like I said, I'm pretty sure the beans are canned.  The diablo chicken was a little gamy and dry and the jade red was dry.  The jerk rice was ok.

Long story short?  Don't bother.  I don't know what Guy Fieri saw in this place.
