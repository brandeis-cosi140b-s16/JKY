My feelings about Cafe Rio turned dubious when I saw prices higher than Chipotle or Qdoba, with fewer meat choices (no carnitas!). The dubiousness doubled down when  I got a look at the fixings.

It was a long look, as the large staff seemed utterly uninclined to wait on me. After a long while, one gal pointed me out to another, who smiled at her coworker and went back to whatever she was doing with the grill. At this point, I gave up and left.

The idea that checking off store tasks is way more important than waiting on customers probably comes from management, so I'm not going to blame the very young and probably inexperienced staff. But if it's your business model to figure that customers can damned well wait until somebody gets around to them and there's no hurry or need to even acknowledge them waiting, then you'd best be either way cheaper or way better quality than your competition. There is no reason I'd give Cafe Rio a second chance.

I went to one of the other restaurants in the same strip and had a very nice experience there.
