After agreeing to meet a friend here, as this was Her favorite spot. I showed up on the wrong "party" night. 
It was extremely loud and chaotic.
I attempted to order a drink at the bar while I wait for Her, and with NO luck. 
We decided to go next door to another space.
Perhaps you might want to try the space on a slower afternoon?
