Used to live near Rokerji and Richardson, loved it. When I read this was close to my new place and not chain, I was very excited. 

The bar is a dimpled copper and they do use hatch chili, but it pretty much stops there.  The waitress was present at first but slow. The stuffed poblano was tasty, but the corn was cold.  I ordered the green chili stew dinner next. The stew had chili but no salt or other seasoning at all. When the waitress stopped by to ask how it was and I commented about the lack of salt, she replied "that's why we put it on the table".  As I continued to eat it, I found chili skin after chili skin.  I finally gave up.  When I mentioned that I was disappointed due to the pepper skins, her response was "they are chili not peppers".  I simply smiled and asked her to take it back. She did and brought me the bill, with the stew on it, despite less than 1/4 of it gone.

Mediocre food, rotten service, even worse customer service. If you want good New Mexico food, drive the distance to Richardson's or if you don't want to drive, stick with Ariba's, but DO NOT go to Secreto.
