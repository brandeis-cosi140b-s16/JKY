wow this place is terrible in every way.  I feel bad for the people who work here.  I ordered a corn on the cob and some tacos.  The corn was undercooked, I asked for another one and they were amazed that I refused to eat it uncooked.  The tacos were cold, I complained about that too and they didn't understand what to do.  I should not have to tell you how to make your food right.  The ceiling was leaking all over from the rain.  I could not find a table that was not being leaked on.  The place smells disgusting.  It is a dingy gross old building.  I will never go to an America's again, disgusting!!
