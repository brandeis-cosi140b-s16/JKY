Gross. This is not fusion.  This is like "hey, your Korean condiments got in my Mexican food".  When we got there the place was empty.  The Server was not in the best of moods  she was NOT helpful with suggestions from the menu.  The food was gross. They served chips but gave us(group of five) one tiny basket to share with one tablespoon of Pico Dee Gallo....no offer to fill the chips. The Ambiance was not impressive..old walls covered with a bad paint job. I will not be returning or suggesting this place to anyone. I love Mexican food and I love Korean food so I can't even say how disappointing this place was.
