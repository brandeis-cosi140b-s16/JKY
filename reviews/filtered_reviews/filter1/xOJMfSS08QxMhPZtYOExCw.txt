Kids wanted Mexican......sooooo glad we got a discount offer for this place. I would've been UPSET if I had to pay full price for their "mexican food."  I know it's a chain, but it wasn't good at all.....  Service SUCKED!  Had to wait to be seated.......wait to get drinks ordered........wait to get food ordered.  Our server was MIA, someone else took our order & brough it out to us.  Other staff got our drinks....our server only checked on us once or twice.  We were starving.....ate what we could and left!  Never will we go back!! Sooooo many better places to try.....stay away!!
