FRIENDS DONT let friends eat at tee pee.

I take it all back. THIS is the worst Mexican joint in Phoenix. And that dubyuh ate here elevates it to one star. He probably loved it. Why do you think it's called Tex mex?

"Green sauce" was this dirty water with floating spice leaves. UGH. Rice typically too much pepper, tomatoes not fresh, salsa not fresh, low-grade cheese blech.

Tables too small and on top of each other. First-generation mini blinds saggy, bent, filthy and old. Dingy wall kitsch includes glowy virgin, fake and faded plastic greenery. Add to it screaming children who at some point seem to be trying to outscream each other and you've got the essence of the ambiance which is Tee Pee.

Service is very friendly and staff is dedicated to keeping the dinner moving. If only the food were edible and the surroundings a bit fresher.
