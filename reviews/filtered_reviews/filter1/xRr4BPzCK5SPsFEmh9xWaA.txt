Tried this place because of a groupon.  Good thing it was at a discount, because it was not worth the money.

While the location and building are very authentic and unique for the area, that is about all this place has going for it.

I can't give a mexican restaurant a good review when they charge for chips and salsa, especially when the salsa is below average.

I ordered the smoked chicken enchiladas and was disappointed.  First the waitress messed up my order.  I clearly said I wanted the beans and rice, this is a mexican restaurant, right?  For some reason my mexican food comes out with grilled seasonal vegetables and black beans.  Umm...ok.  I didn't complain, bc I didn't want to wait any longer for my food.  But this is definitely a first.  Overall, the enchiladas lacked flavor and the tortillas were hard.  

I will not return.
