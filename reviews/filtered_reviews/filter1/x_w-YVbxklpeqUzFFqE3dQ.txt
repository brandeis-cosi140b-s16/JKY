We decided to try this restaurant out because we got a smokin' deal from Restaurants.com.  It was a Tuesday night so the place was pretty empty.  We were asked if we wanted to sit on the patio, which we declined because the Non-Smoking Patio is immediately adjacent to a smoking bar.  Um... smoke travels and so the patio was out.  

We were seated in the 'dining' area.  The music was very loud, so the reviews that this was a good place for kids, not so much.  If you want to have a conversation, this is not the place to go.  Not to mention that considering the decor and the number of cowboy hats in the room, the hard rock/heavy metal was sharply out of place.

We were immediately greeted by our waitress who took our drink order.  She brought the drinks out fast and took our food order.  My husband and I both got the carnitas burrito and my in-laws got the chicken tortas.  The waitress promptly brought us some chips and salsa.  Which tasted horrible.  The chips were too thick and were bland.

Once the food arrived it looked good.  Which made the taste all the more disappointing.  While my pork was tender, it was bland.  The sauted peppers were completely raw and not cooked at all. The refried black beans were unseasoned and very bland as well.  The rice was 'eh'. Nothing special.  My in-laws said the tortas were very dry and had to ask for more sauce.  The bread for the torta was supposedly toasted, however there was no indication that it was actually toasted. 

We ordered chicken strips for the kids which were decent, but considering they were dripping with oil, not too healthy. There was so much oil that the breading slid off the chicken.

Over all the meal was extremely disappointing. The service was prompt and our server was very nice but unfortunately we won't be returning.
