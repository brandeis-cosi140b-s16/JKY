This place was terrible. I would give it -1 star if i could but i guess this 1 star would be for the only thing that was good, the tortilla soup. The chicken enchiladas were nasty and OVERPRICED. 3 people in my party ordered them and we all hated them. The spanish rice was not authentic spanish rice, dont know what it was but it was hard. The "refried beans" were not authentic either. The food was cold. The waiter took a while to bring our order, about an hr, and our check.
