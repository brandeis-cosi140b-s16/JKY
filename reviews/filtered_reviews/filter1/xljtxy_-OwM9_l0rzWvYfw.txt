The worst hostesses (your going to try and put a six year old in the bar??), compounded with surly and inattentive waiter + food not on par with their other locations. Big disappointment. This won't be a stop for us in the future and that stinks because I was so excited Arriba's opened a location on my side of town. I had the white sands chimi which has always been good, but there was no pork to the chili. Rice was like it was leftover and when my bean burrito loving little one wouldn't eat the "yucky tortilla and spicy beans", we were out.
