My father and I stopped in for lunch about a month ago the female bartender had no idea about their happy hour?? The hostess did not see does she said someone will bring you menu what?? So my father and I see did our cells are waiter Manny looked very upset since we had seated ourselves he was busy but he was way too rude and unprofessional he never came back to the table after taking our order he kept asking me are you ready to order are you ready to order the two bus boys helping him were better than him I finally had to get up and go get my own margarita that's how he was ignoring us the management from this place are idiots to keep Manny on any longer after that his attitude
