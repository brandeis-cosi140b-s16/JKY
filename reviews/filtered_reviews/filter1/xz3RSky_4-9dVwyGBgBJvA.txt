First off, any Mexican place worthy of mention has good beans.  The beans at N. are so dry and flavorless it's like eating chalk.  Secondly, cheddar cheese melted atop every dish and that is NOT Mexican!!!  3rd- I ordered chile verde.  WHAT???  It was a slab of dry pork covered in Green Sauce!!!! DISGUSTING.
