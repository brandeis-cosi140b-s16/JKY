We came here because of recommendations and when we walked in it was packed so we figured it would be good, I stood in like to order for 1 hour and about 15 to 20 minutes for my food to get ready then had to get in another line to pay. Honestly the food was not that good. Very disappointed. Asana tasted plain and the asada fries were gross. It's not worth it. I should have known when a lady in line said it was whatever nothing to brag about. And the employees are thieves, a lady sitting eating dropped money and an employee walked by and picked it up and put it right in her pocket! That is so dishonest. Smh. There is a first and last for everything
