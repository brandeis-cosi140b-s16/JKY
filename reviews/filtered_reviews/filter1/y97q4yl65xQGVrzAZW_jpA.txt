I was so disappointed in this place. The worst tacos I've ever tasted. Maybe it was just the night but it was terrible. Fish taco was so fishy and was cold. It's hard to mess up a carne asada taco, well they did. Tough meat, cold tortilla. Yuck. And the bbq taco... they don't make them for a reason.
