So much hype for such terrible results. Tacos were incredibly soggy, they had a lot of mismatched sauces that didn't compliment anything, and all of their meat is flavorless. Three tacos for 6 bucks is a deal, but I would rather go to Tacobell and get something crunchy and at least seasoned appropriately for the money. Not a lot of vegetarian options unless you like eating straight up cheese. Seriously, I would never go back.
