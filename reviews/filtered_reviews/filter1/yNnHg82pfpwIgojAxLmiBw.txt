I'm new in town and went to celebrate my birthday dinner with my boyfriend. The micheladas were nothing special. I had some shrimp, quesadillas and poppers.  Shrimp was good but rice was stale. It was hard even after she brought a different plate. The food is bland and I wouldn't pay to eat food like this. the food is definitely over priced compared to how good it is. I'm surprised this place has good reviews and they are still in business. Sorry abuelos two thumbs way down!
