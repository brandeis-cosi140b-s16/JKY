The reviews puzzle me - we went for happy hour, and I've never been more disappointed with a meal.  The tamales tasted like creamed corn (and JUST creamed corn), the quesadilla was fine, but it tasted only like mushrooms - there was no trace of the highly anticipated huitaloche that was in the description, and the tacos were bland and boring.  The Margaritas were just 'mix' - nothing authentic at all. I liked the chipoltle salsa, and the tomatillo salsa was good too - but that was the only redeeming quality.  

It tasted like really bad tex-mex - not Mexican food, and not even good Tex-Mex.  I don't get the hype!  Substantially disappointed - I'm very glad we returned our travelzoo coupon to try happy hour instead, or else I'd have been even more upset!
