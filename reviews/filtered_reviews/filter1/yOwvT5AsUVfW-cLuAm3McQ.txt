I wanted to like this place so much, I gave it 4 tries and just don't like it! I feel like they are trying waaaay to hard to fit in. They need to keep it to the basics and stop trying to be so trendy.

Last time we were there it was the last straw. I just ordered a quesadilla and asked for no cilantro on top because I just don't favor the taste of it. When it came it was covered in cilantro to the point where I could barely see the quesadilla, like they did it on purpose because I asked for none. And then a couple bites in, I found a long piece of hair melted into the quesadilla, so awful! 

It was our date night so we treated ourselves to some fancy drinks, YUCK! There was so much crap in these drinks! I've provided a picture. How about less of the garden and more of the drink! 

Like I said, I really wanted to like this place, the ambience is fun! I've only had one nice waitress (Gina), the other ones either were overwhelmed or didn't seem jazzed to be there.

If you are expecting good Traditional Mexican food, they do not have it! It is so hipster, the flavors don't even make sense together. DO LESS!
