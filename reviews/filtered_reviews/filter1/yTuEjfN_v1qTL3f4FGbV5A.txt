This restaurant by far has the worst service I have ever experienced!! I will NEVER go back!! Not only do they have bad service, but their manager and owner failed to even see the problem that an hour and a half wait time to receive our food was. The manager and owner were very rude, disrespectful, condescending, and unprofessional. They proceeded to tell our party that they accommodated us in seating our party of 12 because we took up table space in their patio. Not only this, but after hearing our complaints of our service the manager said that we had great service that our food only took 45 mins to get to our table. Basically calling all 12 of us liars. I cannot give this place a bad enough review. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone especially if you are visiting Chandler. If you go despite this review with a group larger than 8, make sure that you all take cash. They have a restaurant policy that they will NOT divide up the check, and you can only pay with one credit card or with cash. Apparently this policy is written in fine print on their menu. Therefore, the server did not disclose this information to our party. When it came time to pay we all had credit cards. It took us over 2 hours to speak with management and the owner about these issues. Nothing was resolved. In the end the server separated our bill and the manager and owner acted as though they did us a favor. Again I CANNOT give this restaurant a low enough rating! 

El Zocalo is El Suckalo!!!!
