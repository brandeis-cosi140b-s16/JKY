I was excited to get Mexican food while visiting Arizona and this restaurant is so cute it looked great. We were happy with the seating and it was packed. But the food did not live up to our expectations. The dishes ranged from mediocre (the meat dishes) to horrible. The vegetarian dish was the worst. Multiple dishes marked vegetarian (with their symbol system on the menu) actually weren't when I inquired about the sauce. I ordered a vegetarian burrito and ended up with a plate of rice and beans. Literally. Half the plate was refried beans and rice. The other half was an uncooked flour tortilla with the exact same rice and beans and a tiny bit of melted cheese. I asked for more salsa and some guacamole for some flavor but even the guacamole was rather tasteless. I literally could have made this dish with a tortilla and some refried beans from a can. So disappointed with this.
