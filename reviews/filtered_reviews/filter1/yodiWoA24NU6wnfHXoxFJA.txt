I'm pretty upset with my experience here. 

The first thing I did when I walked in was check out the the menu up front. 

I checked all the options and saw the Fast Break burrito for $5.95 and compared to the rest of the items, it seemed favorable. 

When I went to the register my girlfriend and I ordered the Fast Break burrito. When I was ready to pay it came out higher than I expected. I asked Irany why it was higher than advertised and she argued that's how much it was. My girl friend had to go to the menu up front just to point it out. Irany and her coworker just laughed it off and said that's an old price, her manager would take it down. That got me upset. 

When I got my food, the Fast Break Cajun Chicken burrito, It was OKAY. Although the chicken had a lot of flavor, the rest of the burrito was quite bland. It was only rice and little sauce. 

I will not be returning.
