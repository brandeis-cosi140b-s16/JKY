So. Confused. About. The. Rave. Reviews. Wandered in early Saturday evening for the first time. Smelled like a BATHROOM. Didn't try the signature green tamales so maybe those are secretly awesome. The salsa is just run of the mill. Tastes like supermarket salsa. Yeah there's a mix of chips (flour and corn) ... big whoop. The flour chips are way too oily and the corn chips also just taste like out of the bag chips from the grocery store. I ordered the Shrimp Anejo entree and my husband ordered shrimp tacos. Shrimp was seasoned well but salty. They also did not clean the shrimp - GROSS!!!They were sautéed in olive oil, but the veggies were sautéed in butter... makes sense (not). Onto the beans ... again tastes like out of the can. And my entree came with some weird corn cheese spicy thing which was not specified on the menu - it had just said corn. The best thing was a margarita we got with their signature #Batch91 tequila. Very delicious. But overwhelmed by all the other factors - topped off by the 3-4 FLIES that kept bothering us while eating. Won't be returning to this place.
