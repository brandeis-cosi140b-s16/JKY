Actual conversation:
Waitress: "And for you, what will you have?"
My daughter: "The nachos."
Waitress: "What kind of meat?"
Me (I'm the mom): "No, she just wants the nachos off the appetizer section."
Waitress: "It comes with it.  Beef, chicken, carne." 
daughter gives a happy look because it didn't say that on the menu
Daughter: "I'll have the chicken please"

Menu price $7.99
Billed $10.99 because it does not, in fact, "come with it."  

So, aside from that round of utter bullsh*t, we already were not pleased with this place. 

It was crowded. The tables were all kind of close together.  Not uncommon, and probably wouldn't ordinarily make me take away stars - but this is a Mormon establishment and when you have a table a foot away from you with children of any age you have to be extra careful what you say... and you want to be relaxed at dinner and not feel like you're going to hell because you said a random curse word, godda*n it!  (See what I mean?  If you're reading this and you are LDS you already feel uncomfortable...)

Onto the food.  Oh my gosh!  How are there so many good reviews on this places food? Do the Mormons really think this is good or are they supporting this place because it is Mormon owned??  Please, by all means, judge for yourself... but it's neither authentic nor run-of-the-mill.  It's just not good.  I also ordered nachos, vegetarian style, and they tasted smokey.  I don't want smoke in my nachos!  Who wants smoke in their traditional nachos?  Every person in my group reported their meal was ever so slightly smokey.  The salsas were weird, and not in a good way.  I cannot put my finger on it.     

Clearly, not going back.  Especially after blatant nacho fraud.
