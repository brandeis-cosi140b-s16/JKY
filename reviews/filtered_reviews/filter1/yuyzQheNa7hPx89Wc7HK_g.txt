I always go to this location right by my house.. I was very disappointed when I asked for my usual veggie enchiladas and the server told me they are no longer allowed to put beans inside any enchiladas, tacos etc and that their managers claim that it is a"waste of food"... How exactly is it a waste of food if I will be eating it? It makes no sense and I don't eat meat therefore I have to make other options for myself. I will be sticking with chipotle from now on they always make whatever I want!!
