I had a great time at Julia's UYE here!  I was not sure what to expect, and I had a really good time.  I was not impressed by the restaurant however.  The place in funky and fun, and I really liked the eclectic decor.  The people are very friendly, and the food was tasty.  I had a great soup that I enjoyed very much. HOWEVER, I feel that the staff took advantage of our entire group.  Two people ordered small appetizers in which the staff took the opportunity to turn into multiple, small, $25 appetizer plates. We were not expecting this, and it inflated our bill dramatically.  I would say there was a little bit of a language barrier between us, but the staff certainly was able to flatly say they had explained it to us.  I feel we were  treated rudely, and our bill was deliberately inflated as no one else was in the restaurant.  The food was good, but certainly not worth the price, and although I will forgive many breaks of service, when it is done deliberately, I will not go back.  All in all I had a wonderful time with the group (thank you all!!!!), but I will not return here on my own.
