Nothing has worked in this location which is convenient and has good parking because each horrific incarnation at this spot is trying to be some kind of snooty, trendy place to attract the "in" crowd. Word, the "in" crowd went bust on credit card debt. If you want to survive, cater to real people who care about what they are eating. 

I was dragged here against my better judgment while attending a meeting in Scottsdale. The place was empty at 7pm. That indicates there is usually a reason. The snooty hostess seated the group but I was already smelling something I did not like. It's an odor one finds in a Mexican restaurant that uses it's oil way too long and has other kitchen issues. The decor is bizarre for a Mexican place and the menu is trying too hard to impress. When I saw the runny plastic goo called chile con queso come out that several had ordered and smelled the stale chips, I actually faked a phone call to get out of there. I had my own car and headed to a bar I know downtown that has never let me down. 

The next day I polled my compadres about dinner and impressions ranged from "just ok" to "awful". I'm indigenous Mexican and pretty hard to please so I'll let those comments tell the story, but if you want real Mexican food, go to the deli at Food City at McKellips and get a green chile burrito and some salsa quemada. $1.29, smells good and tastes good. Skip the $18 entrees and Papi Chulos altogether.
