We went for Mother's Day 5/10/15 and we had to wait for one hour to order even though we had reservations. While we waited we had to refill our own drinks by getting up to see the bartender and get water from the mimosa bar. When we were finally served an hour later my meal was not not appetizing. I ordered the Parmesan, pecan encrusted chicken salad and the chicken was on the cold side, but I could tell it was supposed to be hot. My mother's sausage was under cooked and I'm worried because my 2 year old son ate some raw sausage. Two meals got switched and the person who doesn't eat tomatoes had to pick them out of the eggs. The part that made it really unfortunate was that our meals came at different times. At first people waited to eat and then after a half hour of waiting people started on their meals. After most people were done my sister-in-law was finally served. In the end the manager came to the table and took off some meals and the drinks and gave some gift certificates for us to give them another chance. But, the experience was marred and to add insult to injury they never brought the mothers their special free desert. 

All in all a very disappointing experience.
