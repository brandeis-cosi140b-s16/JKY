I don't even know where to begin to point out all the sucks about Macayo's.. they have NO redeeming qualities about them. Greasy chips, tasteless watery salsa and horrible food!

We ate at this location twice and both times we ordered the mini chimi's which BOTH times came to the table frozen in the middle! Uhg! Most learn from their mistakes, not here.. they make the same mistakes and obviously don't care enough to try to make things right.  Both entree's were served to us at room temperature. Chicken Quesadailla and the Baja Enchilada. 

If you want to have decent Mexican food please, go somewhere else! For this style of food I think I would prefer Carlos O'briens.
