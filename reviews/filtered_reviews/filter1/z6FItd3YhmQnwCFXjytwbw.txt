Went there Thursday for dinner with my wife. We asked for an outside seat and she said 30-35 minute wait, we said we would take an inside table. They took us to a seat that was outside as there were many empty table we said thanks. The waiter Mike came to our table and said even though you are not supposed to be seated here I will take care of you. He was rude, not our fault they sat us there. The service was terrible and the food was not good at all, a tourist restaurant. Never will go back
