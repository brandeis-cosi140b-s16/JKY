Ordered a chimi. The waitress brought me a burrito. I told the waitress I ordered a chimi. She said it was. I told her a chimi is deep fried. She looked like I just kicked her dog. She took it back and brought back the same thing acting like they did something different. I asked for the cook, he said it was deep fried. It wasn't, I gave up and ate it. All tortilla with a tablespoon of meat...horrible.
