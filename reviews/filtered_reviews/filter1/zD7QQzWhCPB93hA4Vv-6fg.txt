Not sure what experience former reviewers have with Mexican food but don't believe the positive reviews. This place was awful. Carnitas are stiff and smell like old feet, bland chicken tacos, bland enchiladas. Only positives were the shrimp which were decent at best and the homemade tortillas but what good is a tortilla if there's nothing tasty to put in it. 

If you're from la or sf skip and save your Mexican for cali. If you're from Vegas go anywhere else. There's no way it can be worse than this.
