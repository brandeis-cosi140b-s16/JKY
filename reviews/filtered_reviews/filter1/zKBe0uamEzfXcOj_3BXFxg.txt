On Saturday February 8,2014 at 2:45 we entered San Felipe's restaurant at Tempe Market Place with the intention of having a drink and appetizers before a movie. It was not particularly busy and there were only seven patrons sitting at the bar.In addition, there was a bartender and what I would perceive as a bar back working the large bar. Although he had clearly walked by us two times, the bartender never acknowledged our presence. He continued to ignore us from the other end of the bar even though we were in direct line with him. Finally we caught a female server walking by and asked if she could locate someone to help us and watched her walk to the other end of the bar and speak to the bartender.Apparently that made us all the more invisible ,since he continued to ignore us and served a couple that came in at that moment.
Finally twenty minutes later, as we were leaving, we accounted our bad experience to the young ,blonde hostess and where we received an "awww ".
Aww...not sure that I would recommend San Felipe's to anyone -
