A friend and I entered this restaurant, it has beautiful authentic Mexican American decor... The bar is decent looking - nothing to brag about... We were seated immediately... The place was empty, but it was 3pm on a weekday, so we thought nothing of it... Our waitress greeted us w/ tortilla chips that were cold and hard as a brick... Still didn't think much of it... you would think that they would be fresh and warm... but they weren't... We ordered our drinks... I had tea w/ honey and lemon, my friend had a original mojito... Very simple drinks right? Well not for this establishment the lemons that they gave me were sour and after I asked for more lemons she brought our more sour lemons. His mojito was the worst I had ever had... The lime that they decorated the glass w/ was dry and sour the mint used in the drink was either poor quality or used before... It taste like tonic water... It was so bad that it couldn't be finished... Our entrees were a different story the carne asada burrito that he  ordered was huge and he seemed to enjoy it... I only the other hand ordered a crispy chicken taco - only thing you could taste was the cheese and salsa on the taco -  the chicken taste like nothing - a cheese enchilada w/ green sauce - which was decent and a chicken tamale - it was the worst tamale  I have eve had in my life the red sauce was sweet, the masa they used was so dry and the chicken taste like nothing - it was awful... I was so disappointed... Would of been better to go to a small authentic Mexican restaurant and would of paid half of what we paid...
