Maybe I'm spoiled being that my home digs of Los Angeles has amazing Mexican food on nearly every street that costs a quarter as much as this food. 

1. Alberto the waiter was rude. Yes, the tap water in Vegas is bad but you don't need to get in an argument with your guest about it. Just say sorry and offer a bottle of sparkling to purchase. 

2. The rib eye - rare when we asked for medium. 

3. Fajitas were ok, looked like a mess on the plate. Beans are directly from a can and just reheated.  

4. The chicken enchiladas - frozen? Hot in the middle and very cold on the edges. The entire meal was basically luke warm. 

5.  The corn is just slathered on one side with salty slightly lime barely spicy dump in cheese. 

6. When asked what the guajillo sauce tasted liked the answer was "I couldn't even begin to describe it." Really?!?!

7. No refills on the Arnold Palmer. 

8. Took 10 minutes for the check to be picked up and our card run through. 

Don't bother with this place for a meal. It may just be good enough for booze and chips and salsa.
