Love the food, HATE their service. But it only seems like its at the  sahara and ft. apache location!  The other locations are so nice and friendly, this one questions you when you call to say your order is wrong. I called the other day to say my salad was wrong and the 5 mangers there couldn't answer the phone so I got some smart ass girl to ask me if I was sure I was wrong! I hate that its the only one near work so I have to go to it.
