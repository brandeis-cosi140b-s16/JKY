We came for happy hour on a Monday. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very rude. Multiple bartenders were forceful in trying to make us order food even though we were clear that we just wanted drinks. The gringorita was not drinkable and a disgrace to all margaritas. This place has a lot of potential, but the service won't allow it to reach it.
