I really have to say don't go here. A couple of our party stopped in to get buy 1 get 1 happy hour drinks, then decided to hang out and get food. Our server was nice, but completely overwhelmed. It took 20 minutes between when we were able to place a drink order then a food order because he was nowhere to be found. Once we had ordered our food, it took almost 45 minutes to arrive, which tells me the kitchen was slammed as well. Twice we had someone attempt to deliver the incorrect order to our table, which ended up being for the tables around us.

The food was just ok - shrimp quesadilla was a little undercooked (cheese not completely melted) and very overpriced at $16. The habanero sauce is legit though - super hot! That was nice. The "big mama" drinks are not much more than a pint - we tested refilling one from a water glass. It's mostly just thick plastic. Once we were done eating, it took forever to get the check and another forever for them to process the payment. Luckily we were with good company, but I'd definitely not come back by choice.
