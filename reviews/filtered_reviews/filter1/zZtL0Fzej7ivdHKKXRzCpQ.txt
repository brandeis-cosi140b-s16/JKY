It was really busy late night on Saturday. It took  over 30 minutes for the 3 of us to get 12 tacos because of their line system. That did not bother me very much though; it was the cashier who counted the number of tacos herself, overcharged me an extra taco, and failed to give my receipt when I paid for my food. After getting seated, I realized that had happened. I quickly went back to the cashier to let her know so I can get a free soda since I didn't want to wait in line for a taco.  Due to the language barrier, a coworker of hers explained the situation. The cashier refused to admit she overcharged me and did not do a single thing to make matters better, even after I did the math and showed her the amount I was charged in my credit card. If it were an accident, that's totally understandable. I think it was intentional. On the flip side, I really enjoyed the tacos despite the ordeal. Anyhow, just watch out for this kind of thing. I know it seems silly to trip about $2, but it is the way the situation was handled that can make any meal turn sour. Luckily, there is a Tacos El Gordo in San Diego.
