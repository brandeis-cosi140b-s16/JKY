Okay so I tried to attempt to surprise my husband by going here again after our first adventure there and did not have a pleasant experience. But once again we were disappointed we went on Feb 15th waited 45 minutes to come sit which was fine but when they called us to go sit  there was tons of seats open the nightly traffic had slowed down a bit so you could see they were not to busy especially in the section we were seated in. On to our waitress. Very unfriendly so unfriendly I can't even remember her name. It took her 15 minutes to even as us what we wanted to drink then we order the OH SO Yummy Guacamole but again it took 10 minutes to get that and she was in a hurry and added way to much lime juice but it wasn't even worth complaining about cause we never seen her around. And when ordering our food we had questions about the food and the waitress refused to even explain it was like she was in a hurry. I was very frustrated and just ended up ordering 2 taco's and my husband just a burro. We waited a very long time to even see our waitress to get our check . I don't know why we have twice now received this type of treatment from this place. I am not complaining about the food just the service treatment. Very disappointed again.
