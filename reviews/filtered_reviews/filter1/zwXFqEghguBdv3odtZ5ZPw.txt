Went to Senor Frogs for E-40 & Suga Free pass thtough. It was not a concert. Imagine being told by staff you can't wear a ball cap finally getting in and there are ball caps. Over-priced drinks and listening to the 97.5 dj trying to keep the energy up. We got there at 10 pm and the show was a lil late by 2 AM the crowd was enormous,  it was hella hot, packed in like sardines, no show. We left our folks there because hell it was 2 AM and we weren't gonna spend $200 plus for bottle service. Never saw E40 or Suga Free and I find out E40 didnt come on stage until 4 AM and did 3 songs and left. (Blank Stare). Rip off. Luckily we won these tickets, but for those who bought them, I'd be all over the sponsors for a poor product. Senor Frogs, I know you're in it for the money, but packing people in with no promised show until the frikkin morning is not cool. And if I could write a bad review to E40 on yelp, I would.
