Do NOT do the yelp deal. It's a scam if you plan on having lunch with someone else that has also purchased the deal. It clearly states on the coupon that the limit is one per person, but they tell you later that it is only one per table. So we bought 5 and ended up being able to use 5. What a joke. They need to be honest in their terms. The only reason I gave them 2 stars is because they were quick to fill our glasses and the food was mediocre. Won't go back
