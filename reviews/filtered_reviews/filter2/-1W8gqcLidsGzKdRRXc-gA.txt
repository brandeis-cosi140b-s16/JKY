We went on a Thursday night around 6 PM thinking it would not be busy.We were quoted 20 to 40 minute wait but ended up getting seated after an hour and 15 minutes. There were about 5 open tables when we got seated. Our server came by once and we ordered everything at that point. He never returned to see if we needed anything else not even another drink. We never got our waters we asked for as well. Then we had to hunt him down for our check which he brought 10 minutes later. I won't be returning. The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because my tacos were good.
