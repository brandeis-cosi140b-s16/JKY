I've given lots of high/low reviews. This one is towards the middle. You can't nail them on anything in particular, either good or bad. The menu is aiming high(er). The food (what I had) is not bad at all, but then it's not cheap. It certainly didn't blow my mind; nowhere close. I think this is just the place you go for a date or to drink alcohol and to see and be seen. If that's your priority, then you'll probably be plenty satisfied. Then again, that would make you a narcissistic bleach-blonde sock-puppet incapable of good taste. 

I certainly got the feeling from the waitstaff that I was being ranked, and when the bill was not adding up quickly enough, their attention drifted away from me. I kinda hate that, especially since I worked in restaurants, and I know that tips are a self-fulfilling prophecy most of the time. 

Anyway, not hitting them too hard, because everyone just managed to do what they had to within a slim margin of error. No real complaints. 

Enjoy those margaritas, sock-puppets!
