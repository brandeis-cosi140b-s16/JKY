Came here before an ASU football game and it was packed. The service was poor (slow, order came out wrong). Not sure if it was because of the volume of people or not, but management should staff more employees in anticipation of this on game days.

The food is nothing special and the prices average. The only positive aspec tis the atmosphere. It is partially outdoors and brightly decoratedon the inside.
