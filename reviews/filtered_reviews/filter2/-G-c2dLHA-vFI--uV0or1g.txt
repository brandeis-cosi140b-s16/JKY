Dined here for lunch on a weekday afternoon with a friend and thought we try this establishment since they served New Mexican cuisine. I would like to say that I am from New Mexico, and also in the food service industry, so I may be more critical. 1st of all I would like to say we had Ok service, a pitcher of water was placed at our table for us to self serve, and with prices as they are I would expect more attention placed on service.  2nd of all, food was lackluster. I ordered a pork tostada and pork taco entree which was very greasy and tasteless ( i taste more grease then anything else). Rice was bland and beans taste as though it came from a can. Definitely not what I remember of items I have enjoyed in New Mexico. Only item I did enjoy was their salsa. My friend ordered an entree which was Carne something, which he said had very little meat. It's now been 2 hours since we ate and we are hungry again.. Definitely would eat at another place next time...
