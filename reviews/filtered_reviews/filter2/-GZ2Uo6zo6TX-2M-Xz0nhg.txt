Been there three times, twice they didn't have guacamole.  Took the family on Thursday night to hear live reggae, which they had confirmed when I called earlier in the day.  Ordered guac...no guac.  Ordered beef with mole...we're out of mole.  Wife ordered carnitas, after long wait, waitress came back and informed her they were out of carnitas.  I think any problems relate to laissez faire management.  Service is slow because they don't pay for enough staff.  Food takes long b/c there is only room for one cook in the tiny kitchen.  Food definitely tasty, but don't plan on getting in and out in an hour.  Would be a good place to sit, spend time with friends, eat some tasty small plates, listen to reggae.  Oh yeah, the band never showed up that night, either!
