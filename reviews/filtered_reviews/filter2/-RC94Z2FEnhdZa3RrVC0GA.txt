Wow! It's gone downhill. 

It's just not the same... I order some Carne Asada and Enchilada plate.. After a few bites I was so confused. It was so bland and for some reason the enchilada had a weird powder texture. I unfortunately returned it, the server apologized and had it removedfrom the check but no manager came by?? 

So strange....
