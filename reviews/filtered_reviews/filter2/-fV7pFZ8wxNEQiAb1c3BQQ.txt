First tried Aunt Chilada's years ago . . . I've been to both locations and think this one is the lesser of the two.  Both locations have great atmosphere and are inviting although this one, less so as well.

I called ahead for reservations just in case and was told they don't take them.  Luckily, it was not very crowded when I showed up so reservations were not needed.  The restaurant however filled up within a half an hour so I'm glad I didn't have to wait for a table.

My dinner guest and I chose to sit in the outside patio area which is very colorful and spacious.  Service was pretty good.  We were greeted relatively quickly although there was a delay in taking our order.

I ordered what I typically order at a Mexican joint in order to compare it to similar dishes elsewhere . . . chille relleno and a tamale.  Sorry to say AC's relleno is average at best . . . it didn't jump my taste buds seeming rather bland and lifeless despite a mildly spicy green sauce.  The tamale was dry and had an unusual taste that was not particularly pleasant or familiar.

The upside was the service.  My dinner guest was an intellectually disabled woman I mentor for Special Olympics . . . she is somewhat child like and believed that her relleno which she also ordered, was "too spicy."  Our waiter graciously replaced it with a milder selection and did NOT charge us for the first dish.

With all the fabulous Mexican eateries in Arizona, I wouldn't waste my time or money with AC.  There is nothing special about it although the other location may have some historical significance.
