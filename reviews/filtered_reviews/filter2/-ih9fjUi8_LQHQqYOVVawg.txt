Only the decent food and drinks make up for the incompetent service at this place.  

I was ignored for 20 minutes before being acknowledged or having my order taken.  

All of the menus appeared to be torn and ripped from their menu holders? Really how much can it cost replace menus?

When my order was finally taken the server tried to deliver to me the wrong drink and food order TWICE!  

When I finally received my food, a quesadilla, now 30 minutes after ordered, it was served without a napkin or utensils!  It takes 30 minutes to make a quesadilla?! 

The quesadilla with pork was actually tasty - tender pork but sloppily served. 

Rude and lazy servers.  Not recommended.
