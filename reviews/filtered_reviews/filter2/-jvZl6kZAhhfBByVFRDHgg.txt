This restaurant is definitely not your top of the line, quality mexican food. Being a big fan of Mexican food, I was pretty disappointed, as my craving was not fully met. It was served cool, warm at best, and the flavors were just ok. The service, however, was good. I would not go out of my way to make a trip back here.
