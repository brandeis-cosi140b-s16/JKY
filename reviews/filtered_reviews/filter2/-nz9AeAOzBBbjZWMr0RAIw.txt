The entire experience was a giant "Meh" all around.  We reserved a table for six and were squished around a table for four.  It's wasn't terrible but it would behoove a dining establishment to make it larger-group-friendly.  

The happy hour house margaritas were okay.  They tasted pretty watered down.  We ordered a pitcher later (at full price, of course) and it tasted better.  That's major points lost for me - an inferior happy hour version or Restaurant Week version does not inspire me to return.  

Service was extremely slow although to their credit, it does say they're slow on the menu so they get points for honesty.  One of my dining companions noted that the menu says they charge $1 for a refill on chips.  That's a sad excuse for a Mexican joint in my opinion.  

My food was spicy but just okay.  I got the feeling they cover up the average-ness of the food with a lot of spice.  

It felt like one of those places where they nickel-and-dime you for everything.  I expect that at fast food restaurants but for a sit-down meal?  Where we would have likely lingered and spent money?  No thank you.
