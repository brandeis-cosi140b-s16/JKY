Meh, food was fine, but overpriced (even for airport food). There looks like a disconnect between the male and female servers: the male staff looks very professional in shirts and ties, but the females (even with "dress shirts" and ties) don't look professional at all, more like what a high school girl would consider "professional." (For more clarification, the men are dressed how you expect restaurant managers to dress, while the women were a tad on the sloppy or too-casual side). My server (well, most of the female servers) was inattentive, bringing me a refill for my drink when I was clearly finished with my meal, and all of the women seemed to congregate near the kitchen or next to the bar to chat and joke. There were far too many waiters and waitresses, and they could definitely make do with fewer.
