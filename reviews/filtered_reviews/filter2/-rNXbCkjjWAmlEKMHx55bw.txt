The reason this gets two stars is because their avocado bruschetta was interestingly good. And i like the idea of mexi/italian food! However, they need a new bar tender. My guests beer was poured all frothy and not only did it make the glass all sticky but when it settled there was half a beer left. They also forgot my drink but didn't forget to charge for it! I don't recommend going for drinks.
