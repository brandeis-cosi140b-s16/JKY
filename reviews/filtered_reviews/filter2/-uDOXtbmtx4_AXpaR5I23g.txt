We went there on 11/16 at 5:30pm, it was early, not sure our servers name but she was absolutely awful. Slow, a bit rude too. The food was okay. We have been there before and the food was better,  this time it was bad, served too cold. It took 45 minutes for our food to come even though the place was half empty- they were waiting for a very large party to come in that took up most of the restaurant.  I like the location and the drinks, but that waitress makes me hesitate to try them again.
