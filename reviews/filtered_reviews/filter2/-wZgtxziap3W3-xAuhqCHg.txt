It's my first time here.  You know the saying about first impression?  Well, I came here based on the reviews & sometimes the best gems are holes in the walls.  This is NOT one of them.  I ordered some kind of an imitation guacamole paste, hate when restaurant give fake food.  they delivered my spicy shrimp & never once checked on me.  When they gave me my check there was no thank you not even gracias!   I think a robot could be programmed to be more polite than the people here.
