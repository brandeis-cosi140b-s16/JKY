I hope David's Hamburgers & Mexican Food burgers are better than their Mexican food.  David's has a '50's theme that for some reason always raises the caution flag. Yet it was clean and very empty, however I arrived right in the dead zone between lunch and dinner. 

After a quick look at the menu I ordered the chicken enchiladas. The server then asked a strange question, "Would you like the free chips and salsa that come with the meal?"  "Well yes a would thank you.", I replied. My free chips soon arrived as did my salsa. The salsa was freshly made but about as bland as one can make salsa, not a good sign. After a short wait my enchiladas arrived. I must say they looked quite good. Yet after the first bite it all went down hill. Bland sauce, bland chicken, dry chicken did nothing to improve on the salsa. The refried beans that came with the enchiladas were too bad, not great, but good. The in house made guac was excellent. Service was average. My un-enjoyable didn't get finished which should tell you something. 

Enchiladas, soft drink and free chips $13 with tax.

Will I be back? Maybe, the reviews for the burgers are quite good. The in house made guac almost got it 3 stars. Just say a big NO for the Mexican.
