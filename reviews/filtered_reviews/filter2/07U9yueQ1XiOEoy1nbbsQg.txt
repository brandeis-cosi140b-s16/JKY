Clubby kind of place, especially for 5pm dining. Guy used a flash light to make a strobe light affect - Extremely tacky!  Plus, he was shining it in people's eyes, such as mine and I was clear across the room.  Waitresses stop & dance, so if you need service quickly, it will be hard to grab them at that time.  The chips and salsa were awesome!  However, it was too bad that it was not free w/dining.  The fajitas didn't really have any special or different flavoring.  It was kinda bland.  Overall experience was ok.  Would recommend this place more for dining before going to a club or another bar atmosphere.  We took our 2 year old son, not the greatest place for kids, but in some cases think the entertainment was a bit of a distraction-could go either way.

Pros: 
-Chips, Salsa 
-music, dancing, noise can be good for kids - distraction 
-Good place before going out - good party kinda atmosphere 


Cons: 
-Very loud 
-Strobe light effect with a flashlight 
-Can be bad for family 
-not good for business meetings or discussion 
-wait staff not very quick and stop and dance 
-chips/salsa and guacamole took a long time to bring out - have to pay for chips/salsa (not included) 
-More pricey than most places 
-Not conveniently located if you are driving to the Flamingo - parking there sucks and walking to restaurant is further 

If you are looking for more of a bar atmosphere before going out and getting some drinks maybe even chips/salsa, this may be a good place.  

4 people with 2 year old = $100/dinner price (did not include drinks) 
-2 hamburgers 
-chips and salsa
-guacamole 
-1 Fajitas beef/chicken combo (shared by 2) with shrimp
-side of corn

=little pricey 

Groupon helped and not sure if we would go back w/out it!
