Their pink tacos were not that good.  I went with two of my friends, and they werent that crazy about their food either.  I would give this place a second chance, but my first time wasn't as good as I thought it'd be.  Also, they had advertised some happy hour and when we went there they didn't have it.  The atmosphere here is cool, a lot of young people...oh, and I saw my brother's long lost twin! not related, but it was a spitting image of my brother...really weird.  Confronting this guy cause I thought it was my brother was prob the highlight of my experience here.
