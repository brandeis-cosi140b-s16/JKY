Mexican food and Chinese food under one roof and not a buffet?  The concept of this place is amazing, but the execution is something left to be desired.

My girl and I wanted to have a great culinary experience at this place, but we left disappointed.  The decor was pretty cool, taking pieces from both cultures.  However, for being more of a tapas place, the table was tiny (couldn't fit more than two or three plates) and the chairs were kind of uncomfortable.  The service was alright at best.  The prices were not very friendly at all.

The food was nothing spectacular.  Being from LA, I could get just as good a taco from several trucks straight off the street.  But, I did enjoy the lobster taco (way too pricey tho $10 for a small corn tortilla taco).  We also did like the queso fundido w/ chorizo.  That was definetly a tasty way to start of the meal!  The scallop shumai were alright and the other tacos were ehh.  Overall, we greatly overpaid for a mediocre brunch.

The place seems pretty cool, but once you sit down and start eating, the allure of the decorations and swankiness seem to just fade.  You leave with a lighter wallet and an unsatisfied belly.

Note: For being a new place you would expect decent facilities right?  Well my girlfriend comes back from the restroom and tells me that the lock wasn't working and that some girl had almost walked in on her using the restroom.  Ladies beware! Haha!
