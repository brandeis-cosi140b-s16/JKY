Had family in town and wanted to take them to one of my favorite places in The Valley. I should have gone with my gut and not taken the 9:15 reservation but they really wanted to eat here. We were seated at about 9:30 and they were definitely not ready for us. We received water right away and then were assured by the manager that we would be well taken care of. We didn't see our waitress for 15 minutes after that. She was good and very nice considering she was our bartender for an hour and a half while we were waiting for our table drinking. We wanted a pizza and they said they weren't serving them anymore?  Ordered our apps. and they were good. Ordered our dinners and the Caesar salads came out without dressing. Ouch. Dinners were OK. Just not as good as every time else I have been there. Oh well. Maybe it was too late in the evening.
