I went here on recommendation of friend of friend. I missed lunch and crave Mex carbs. Traveling to LV I know this town is a virtual wasteland when it comes to good Mexican food.

As I walked in I had the feeling of deja vu knowing I had been here many years ago but no recollection of the food. There's a reason I blocked it out. 

Decided to sit at bar. Bartender was attentive and best part of the experience. Great chitchat and good Margarita. 

I had the (recommended) enchilada and chili Verdi burrito. The burrito was ok. The pork was pretty tender but there was potato chunks as filler. The beef enchilada was cold. She took it away and said they would put it in the microwave... Says it all there.

Won some money in the bar slot machine and no charge for the drink. So the meal was cheap. No repeat
