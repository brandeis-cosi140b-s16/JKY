I stopped in to Senior Frogs Las Vegas with 3 of my colleagues while attending a business conference there. The decor was very 'I'm a college student on Spring Break - Let's Party'! We sat down and was waited on by a cute brunette/single mother who was polite. I ordered a chicken burrito with sauce.

When the burrito came it had 2 different kind of sauces (one was sort of sweet). Didn't really go with a burrito. The beans in the burrito seemed dried as if they had been sitting for a while. 

Overall, I was disappointed. Not traditional Mexican food by any definition of the word. Being a California native I've arguably have tasted some of the best Mexican food and Senior Frogs was not it!
