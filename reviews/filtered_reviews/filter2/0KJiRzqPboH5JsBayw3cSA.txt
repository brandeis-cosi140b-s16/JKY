I ate lunch a few times here this year when I worked nearby. I'd gotten a couple of breakfast burritos that were acceptable, with my major complaint being the nearly raw and flavorless tortilla. I guess I am spoiled by Carolina's tortillas. I also think it's baloney that they charge the to-go people for chips, but not those who sit and dirty their tables. How does that make sense?

The real travesty is the $5 fundido Wednesday special. My colleagues were so gaga over it for weeks, that I finally broke down and got one. When I expressed my *ahem* disappointment, I got labeled a "foodie snob."  If being a foodie snob means that I don't find bland, boiled, hard chicken surrounded by a messy pile of other sub-standard ingredients acceptable, then I am a proud foodie snob. I've had fundido at plenty of other Mexican places around town, and this is no fundido.
