Last time i took the kids here we loved it. This time was terrible. Food was expensive. Not worth it at all. My kids can eat almost anything and they didn't like it at all. 22 dollars for crap. 3 dollar quesadillas ok fine.  5 dollar burrito. add 1 dollar for beans. How you gonna charge me extra for what you add to my burrito.i don't want no damn beans in my burrito. .50 for cheese. .50 cents for sour creme ok. They nickle and  dime you to death. $2 chips and salsa. they gave me old ass chips and a bottle of hot sauce. Are you serious. Never again. I have no problem paying extra for good food. Just not crap.
