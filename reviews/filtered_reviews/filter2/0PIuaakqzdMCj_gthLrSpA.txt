So I went to this new location located off of Hayden in North Scottsdale.  They have had signs up for a while so I was pretty excited to have something new for a change.  

We came in at diner time, and went only for dinner, no drinks.

I looked at the menu and saw 10 dollars for three tacos, I thought it was kind of expensive, but maybe the tacos were really good.

I also ordered chips and salsa, and they weren't free. That was a joke.  

I ordered one steak, one chicken, and one Chorizo and Egg.

The steak and the Chorizo and Egg were just terrible.  I had one in a hard shell, and one in a soft shell.  They tasted pretty much the same, and the texture was rubbery.  

The Chicken was decent, and had a little flavor.  

My Fiancee ordered the Vegetarian Tacos, which consisted of beans and green peppers and a hell of a lot more grease than anything I ordered.  One was so grease filled she had to throw it out.

They also had a Salsa Bar that had 4 different Salsas.  One had no taste, one had no taste but was hot, one tasted of onions, and the Green Verde salsa had a lot of flavor and was really spicy.  So 1for 4 is above average, right?  It's good in baseball I guess.

The soft shell tacos were a lot better than the hard shells, I would recommend if you have to eat there,  go for the soft.  Chicken rather than steak.

But hey, I gave Rubios 1 star, so this is at least a step up, but for a lot more money.
