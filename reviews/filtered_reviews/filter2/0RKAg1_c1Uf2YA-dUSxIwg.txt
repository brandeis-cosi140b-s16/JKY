A small New Mexican place across Patrick from Home Depot.

The Good:
1. $1 Beers, well Carlito's speacial brew, tasted like Bud Light
2. Sopillas with honey
3. Very clean inside

The Bad
1. My friend and I both ordered chicken dishes, the chicken reminded me of Roberto's and that's not a good thing
2. There were some serioulsy weird people in there, not the staff but the other patrons, I won't be going back for that reason alone.
3. Add $3 to turn your ala carte item into a "plate"...I paid $3 to add rice, beans and a sopapilla?  Not a great deal, but it wound up being a lot of food and I took more than half of it home.
