I've been here many times for its convenience to the Mandalay Bay Convention Center and the gluten free friendly menu. The flavors are wonderful! Today, however, was my last visit. 

The chef refused to make a dish without a pepper cream garnish. The waiter relayed the chef's response that the enchiladas "must be covered." We asked to substitute his pepper cream with his in-house queso. Our waiter was very apologetic (and embarrassed) when he told us that his chef would not comply. 

The two people at the table with allergies had to eat elsewhere afterward. We have not had this problem with previous chefs at this location, who altered their set dishes to accommodate our food allergies.
