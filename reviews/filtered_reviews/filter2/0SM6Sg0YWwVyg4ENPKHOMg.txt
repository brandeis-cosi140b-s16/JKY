The decor is very well put together. Their chips and salsa are tasty, however, I would prefer unseasoned chips.

For the size of the portions and the (lack of) quality of ingredients, this place is way overpriced.

$3 for a soda?! 

$15.99 for a taco and two enchiladas filled with dry, tough, chicken, reminiscent of Dinty Moore or dog food.

There are too many other Mexican restaurants in town for a greater value. That being said, we won't be partaking in their menu again.
