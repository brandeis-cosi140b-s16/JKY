Stopped In to get a chicken salad for dinner, after waiting longer than usual I finally make it to the register to pay. Three  employees were standing there laughing and chatting like I wasn't there. The girl who takes the money asked if it was for there of to go? I said to go she didn't wash her hands and puts a lid on my salad as she is trying to fit it on I see her pushing my food with her fingers, after she throws it in a bag she comes to get my money and I said maybe the person who takes the money should not touch the food. I was so grossed out. She said "oh I'm sorry" she offer to make a new one but after the wait I said no. Got home looked in bag....no dressing no fork no napkins. Ended up tossing my salad in the trash.
