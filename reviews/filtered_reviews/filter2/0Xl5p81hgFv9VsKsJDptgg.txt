While in Scottsdale for Thanksgiving, the family opted to go out for Mexican Food one night. Not only was I excited to sample some of Arizona's notorious Mexican cuisine, but who am I to turn down a free meal?

Star 1 - How was the service and atmosphere?

While not overly packed on the Wednesday evening that my party of six visited, service seemed a bit on the rushed side. While our particular server (who appeared to possibly the the owner) was very nice, the she seemed to be ushering us along quite quickly. While not enough to warrant a star deduction, this should probably be noted. Star Granted.

Star 2 - How were the portions relative to the cost?

As far as the selection goes, La Fonda is pretty much on par with any of the basic Mexican joints that I've encountered in Colorado or Los Angeles. However, while the menu had a decent selection, mostly combinations of Tacos, Enchiladas, Burritos and Platters, prices were very much on the high side. I opted to go for the Machaca Dinner, and for $13.50 pre-tax, this is what I received:

Hm. Yes, that's a decent amount of meat, but I'd certainly say no more than $6 or $7 worth. That being the case, roughly $6 was spent on basic Spanish rice and beans? Yikes. Even for gourmet Mexican, that's too much. No Star Granted.

Stars 3/4 - How was the food?

While I wasn't disappointed with my meal, it was by no means the best Mexican I've ever had. The Machaca was very dry (overly crunchy at some points, and the rice and beans were nothing special. Especially paying $13.50? Quality needs to be bumped up a bit. Single Star Granted.

Star 5 - Would you eat it every day if you could?

With the truly vast number of Mexican options in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area, I can't say there's any way I could make La Fonda Del Sol a daily stop due to high prices and mediocre food and service. No Star Granted.
