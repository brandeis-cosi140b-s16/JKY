Unremarkable and expensive. $20 for 2 fish tacos that tasted like carp and a carne asada burrito that was mostly rice and beans.  Went here for a work lunch. No one liked the food. Maybe it was an off day, but we won't be back to find out. Add in service that lost one order and I don't know how this place stays in business.  Also, this place no longer offers free chips and salsa. That's an extra $4!

Not sure how this restaurant got their high ranking???  Mexican places are a dime a dozen out here.  This one isn't worthy of its (current) rank.  Look elsewhere for much better fare.
