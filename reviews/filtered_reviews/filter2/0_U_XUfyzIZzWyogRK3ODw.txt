I ate here on a whim because I was hungry for Mexican and wanted to eat next to the Canal in The Venetian.  This looked like it would fit the bill.  Despite no reservation, we were seated in short order next to the Canal.  Appetizer consisted of chips and salsa with guacamole (which more than tripled the price of the appetizer); the reader can decide if this is worth the cost.  It was perfectly adequate but nothing special.  I ordered the chicken burrito, which I assumed would be much like most standard burritos.  What I failed to discern were the words "barbecue sauce" in the description.  And yes, it was absolutely smothered in KC Masterpiece.   To me, this was totally inedible.   Fortunately my daughter's fajitas came with extra corn tortillas, so I could cobble together something salvageable with the innards of the BBQ burrito.  Needless to say, this was not a $30 quality meal.  With 50+ restaurants in The Venetian, you can eat far better than this.
