It's sad. I've been a loyal customer of Rito's Burritos since the Original on Garfield st. Since then I've been excited when they opened a location closer to me, the Orangewood location. When I tried that location it was like I was eating the same quality as the original. 

Now when this location opened, just a little closer to me, I was excited, thinking I'd get fat from visiting too much. That worry was soon solved as I took my first bite into their burros. It's missing a lot. First off, the chile is really thick, although this wouldn't be too bad a thing it's too obvious. It's clearly thickened with flour, because my mouth still feels gritty from eating it. There was so much flour that it was half the flavor of the burro. Second, if that wasn't enough flour for you. The burro is wrapped in a very thick tortilla, unlike their other locations which have a great balance of chile (and thickness), as well as the thickness of their tortillas.

I had high hopes for you guys but you let me down. To those who read this, don't be discouraged about Rito's. Their original and Orangewood locations still deliver the goods.
