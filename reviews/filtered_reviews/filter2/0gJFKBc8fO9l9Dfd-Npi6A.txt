Tried this place after the owners came to the YMCA community fair with free watermelon drink and chips and salsa samples. I will give any business who takes the time to support our community a spin. 

We went as a family and found the food of average quality for the price. The wait staff was attentive but the kitchen was slow. Then the karaoke started up and we just wanted to eat as quick as possible and leave. On a summer night starting the amateur songbirds at 8 sharp when families are still dining together felt chaotic. 

This place is close to our house so we will give it another spin when it is not karaoke night. Perhaps on a a Tuesday when I can't help but smell the fajitas they make on the patio when I drive by.
