I have been to this location several times, typically after attending Zumba events with friends, with decent experiences. On Friday, May 15, myself and a friend went here to grab a quick drink and snack following our workout. We each ordered a sangria (very good) and a Fiesta Platter appetizer plate (nachos, flautas, mini tacos, etc.) and we both specifically requested no tomatoes on it. after waiting 30 minutes, my friend had to leave, and I asked the server to make it to go, for me. The server stated that she had just put in a very large order before my one appetizer, and was sorry. My friend left, my styrofoam encased appetizer finally came, and I opened it to grab a piece to eat and noticed it....loaded with tomatoes. I gave it back to the server, who stated she would have the kitchen make "a new one". Waited another 10 mins for my "new" appetizer. Upon arriving at home about 10 mins later, I noted that the kitchen had merely picked off the tomatoes, since I noticed tomatoes scattered underneath the nachos, and the mini taco I had taken a single bite out of before the server took it back. Not to mention it was pretty cold, soggy, and unappetizing by then, after two trips to the kitchen and home. 

Server was apologetic and nice, but food and service terrible. Won't be frequenting this restaurant after special events with so many other places in the same area.

I wish there was a contact or email link on their website so I could have just written directly to the manager.
