My wife and I came in on a Saturday night around 7:45. Got seated immediately. Salsa was great,  chips on the other hand, not so much,  too thin and oily. My wife had the cheese enchiladas which she said were mediocre. I had the pulled pork plate with the chorizo beans. First off, you can tell the meat had been sitting for a few hours, it was hard and dry. The beans had no trace of chorizo. The only good part of the meal was the actual plain taco. On top of that tr server made us wait 20 minutes after our meal was done to get our bill. Will not return.
