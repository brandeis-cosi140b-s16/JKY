Got 2 dim sum offerings and the mushroom taco.

Shocked that a taco this small with mushrooms and nothing else was 5 bucks. It was nothing special or unique or fusion-y, but overpriced.

The dim sum was of the PF Chang variety --- not really dim sum, very un authentic, and at 11 bucks each, ridiculously overprieced.

The only reason this gets 2 stars and not 1 is that the setting (both hotel and restaurant itself) are gorgeous! But you can do far far better in Vegas, skip this place.
