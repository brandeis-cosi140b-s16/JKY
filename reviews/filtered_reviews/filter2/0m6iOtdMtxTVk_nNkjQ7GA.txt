Just say no!  That is to the endless over-suggestive selling of everything.   Don't get the rice at their suggestion, you have enough food.  Wildly anointing!  Here's the kicker -- one you get you food and don't want another drink, you will never see another server ever.  They obviously don't care if you need something else if it's not going to rack in extra income.  the food itself isn't bad, but you can do so much better in this town.
