This was my first time visiting and unfortunately I'm not a fan. I usually seek to give good reviews on restaurants and find as many positives as possible but I could not on this one. 

We ordered tacos, quesadillas, beans, and chips & salsa. 

The chicken and carne asada meats were delicious, but the rest of the taco didn't come with much else-just cabbage and a hint of red onion. This was mentioned on the menu. They do offer a salsa bar but it only had pico de gallo and a chipotle-type salsa. 

The chips and salsa come with a thin salsa and a thicker red salsa that is very tasty and these were not found on the salsa bar. It's unfortunate for customers who do not order the chips and salsa as they won't get these variations.

The quesadillas lacked quite a bit. They were basically a version of their tacos but larger. Cheese was certainly an afterthought and barely visible. Very disappointed. 

The beans were probably the worst I've had. Absolutely flavorless.  

The restaurant itself is really nice. It's too bad the food doesn't match the ambiance. At first glance of the menu, the prices seem very cheap but now I know the reason why. The menu is very simple, which I like, but they need to go back to the drawing board on a few things otherwise they won't have customers come back.
