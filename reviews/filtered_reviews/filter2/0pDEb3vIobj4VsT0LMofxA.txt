Came here for lunch on a Saturday Afternoon, the restaurant looks very inviting with plenty of seating. 

Decided to order the Margaritas which were very tasty but not $14 tasty. I started off with their "Yucca Fries" for $8, here I am expecting a plate full of "Brazilian Potato" fries like the waiter explained. Nope, it was a tin can with about 4 or 5 REGULAR steak fries (Lol)  Anyways, I ordered the 3 cheese Quesadillas with green sauce and handmade tortillas (I think), they were just decent. Also ordered a torta that did not compare to the taco trucks in East LA. (Sigh) 

Overall, the food here is your typical Mexican dishes that honestly my mom would probably cook better. Although, I did hear the enchiladas were decent ($28).

I would probably not come back here, it just didn't wow me enough, and if I do I would probably hit the bar. Restaurant should really consider revising their menu and prices.

The staff is friendly but you could notice some are brand new and have never worked at a restaurant before. The bartenders are very friendly and make pretty good drinks. 

Probably because I am Mexican I expected more out of this place, but I guess nothing beats Mom's cooking.

*If your in the mood for tacos, head down the strip to Tacos El Gordo and save yourself some money.*
