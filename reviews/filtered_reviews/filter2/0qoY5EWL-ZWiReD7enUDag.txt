I had a couple friends in town and we were drawn in by Buy one get one free margarita coupons. The coupon are only good for 12 oz frozen ones out of the machine but I was also told those were on happy hour too without asking for price. We also got the chicken nacho platter.
The nacho's were actually very good and enough toppings for every chip. 
The drinks however turned out to be $12 a piece on special. So for 3 12 oz (fat Tuesday style) really bad margaritas at a "tequila cantina" for Cabo Wabo it was $24. You would think they would take better pride in the drinks here since it carries the brand name of a Tequila company but no...

So, for all you tourists or locals... do not accept drink coupons from the strip because it will most likely be some type of scam.  The house always wins! I have learned this the hard way now from Rhumbar, Dick's Last Resort and now Cabo Wabo.
