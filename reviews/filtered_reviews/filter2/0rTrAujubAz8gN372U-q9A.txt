The wait downstairs at 10pm was 1 1/2 hours so my group of 6 and I went upstairs to the bar to try and sit down.  They told us it would be 30 mins yet there were tons of empty tables.  We sat at the bar and waited and finally got a seat.  It really wasn't too busy yet it took for-ever to get our food.  Fajitas for $17? NO WAY worth it.  Should have been $10 or 12.  The chips were fine but the 3 kinds of salsa were weak and not very good at all.  We got "free shots" aka 1/4 a shot of watered down vodka.  It seriously took forever for us to get our entrees and even longer to get the bill.  Nobody was impressed with their food and everything was too over priced.  

The view of the strip was beautiful though!
