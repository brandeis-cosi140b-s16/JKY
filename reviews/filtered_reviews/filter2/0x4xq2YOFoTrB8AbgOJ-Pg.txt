I will give this place two stars because the service was pretty good. The food was another story. 
Our waiter was very attentive and offered some great suggestions to start. One of which was the "drunken chicken nachos". We ordered a couple of them for our group and when it was brought over, one of the first comments was - " wtf is that smell?"
I really am not sure what was added to those nachos, but it looked like a pile of crap. It didnt taste any better. So for entrees I think the majority of us either ordered the short ribs or the filet mignon. I guess since this was a Mexican place I should've ordered something else, so maybe this was my fault. But the waiter who took our order described the steak to be comparable to some NYC quaility steakhouse cuts. Steak looked nice and plated well but it was lacking some seasoning. Overall I would not recommend this place or ever go again. Afterwards I began to understand the name YOLO, I felt pretty sick and thought I was going to die. You definitely only live once after eating here.
