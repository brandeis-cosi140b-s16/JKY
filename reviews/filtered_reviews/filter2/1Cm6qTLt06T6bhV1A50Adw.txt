Second visit to this location. Second time we absolutely loved the food. Unfortunately, also the second time we received absolutely terrible customer service by the surly staff. Could these people be any more disenchanted with their jobs? I have never witness a collection of such rude staff. I don't care how delicious your food is. It's not worth waiting thirty plus minutes in line for, only to be rushed through the ordering process while they make mistake after mistake causing the process to take even longer...all along being treated like garbage. We won't step foot into this establishment again. I can think of a number of other places with food equally as good, and a much more friendly atmosphere.
