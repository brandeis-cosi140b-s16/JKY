Hmmm... I should probably leave the review there, but there is just too much to say.

1. Is a margarita up an uncommon term? I use it all of the time at home and everyone seems to know what it means. Tonight the waitress looked at me as if I had 2 heads when I said it.

2. Do not serve me chips in a metal kitchen bowl. They were cold and oily and just not good.

3. I like cilantro just as much as the next person, but when the only thing I taste is cilantro... again, not good.

4. Mom ordered the baja chicken salad, which has to be the nastiest salad I have ever tasted. Too spicy and too much cilantro.

The good news is, that I do not live in Scottsdale and NEVER have to eat here again.  Next time, I will go to Del Taco.
