Two years ago, the food and prices were fantastic. Fast forward to 2015, the prices have gone from what was $1.25 a taco to $1.89. Yes, I understand it's less than $2, but the size of the taco is super small. The carne asada is what used to draw me in, however, it is now very coarse and dry. Super sad that this place with so much potential has deteriorated into a dirty shack without delicious food. We probably will not return.
