We visited again, like I said, we are 3 generations Carolina's fans. The order was not correct, the Carne Asada Burro was cold, the Pico de Gallo (sp?) was so salty it was inedible. come on Carolinas, let's get back to where we were.  The guacamole was fabulous as always, the lettuce on my beef taco was wet...  Ugh!!!
