Came in for late lunch and drinks 1/19 and although the hostess was incredibly sweet and helpful the rest of the staff wasn't fabulous. They were kind but not efficient. It was not busy at all maybe 1/8th full. We waited 15 mins for someone to greet us and another 15 for any form of a drink. Water was never refilled even after asking for it. Food was good we just had guacamole and chips. Drink was ok-not with the 14$. I won't be back unless service is improved a lot. Great decor however and COULD be a great spot.
