I gave David's 2 stars because the food is good, and delivery is generally very fast when we order in the office But... I would not actually recommend dining in. Today a coworker and I decided to give it a shot and dine in, we order in the office all the time and love the food. When we first arrived we were told we could seat ourselves but every table was dirty. an employee came by and cleaned the table we wanted to sit at and then took our drink order. The same girl then took our order a few minutes later we asked for  separate checks and ordered our lunch.  We waited close 30 min for our orders consisting of chicken Fajitas for my friend and, a slice of Cheese cake for me. She did not bring the extra plate my coworker requested or the side of sour cream she ordered, and beyond that she also did not refill our drinks. We finally asked the other employee working if he could bring us the requested items. He got our servers attention and she finally got the items. She had been busy talking on her cell phone and be bopping around she only had one other table it was pretty dead in there actually. When she did she finally noticed our cups needed to be refilled she refilled them with the wrong beverages my friend was drinking Coke and Got a refill of Ice tea. I finally asked for our check because if we didn't get it soon we would be late back to work, big Shocker she did not do separate checks as requested. Really she may have been the worst server I have ever had. I am beginning to wonder if that is just the way it is when you dine in at Scottsdale restaurants, two times this week I went out for lunch near my work and both times it was worse than the other.  

Now the food as always was really tasty but the service was so piss poor I can honestly say I will never dine in again.  delivery only !!!!
