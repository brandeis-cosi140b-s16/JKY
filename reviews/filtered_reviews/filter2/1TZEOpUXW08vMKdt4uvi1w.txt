We usually have gone to Jalapeno Inferno for lunch on Saturdays and one night a few weeks ago decided to go back and try it for dinner.  

I asked for my Margarita like I always do there - Top Shelf on the rocks and - strained.  I don't like the pulp in their home made margarita mix.  I got the first one with all this icky pulp and just asked to have it sent back and just to strain it.  The owner came back and was so rude to my -- in front of our 2 kids no less - saying that he gave us the regular margarita since we didn't appreciate the fact that their mix is homemade.  I told him they strained it for me all the time on Saturdays - bless Patrick's heart.  The owner then told me he did not know how that was done.  I said "Well there's a little thing most bars have called a "STRAINER".  He said he didn't have one.  What???

So forget the better tequila and the Gran Marnier that would normally be in my Top Shelf margarita.  I'm just some low life that didn't deserve that I guess.  

So I find out -- this guy is the OWNER that treated us this way.  We have been there every Saturday at lunch with the 4 of us spending easily $100 a week -- through the slow summer when no one was there and everything.  Yes, good tamales and food in general.  But I'd rather eat in a barn than pay for rude service and line that owners pockets with my money.  We've never been back...
