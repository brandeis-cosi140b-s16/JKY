I was terribly dissatisfied by the pitcher of margarita that we ordered. It was myself my sister and my husband and we got a pitcher to share. Basically we got margarita mix and a lime wedge. They were too sour to enjoy. I would not come here for margarita unless it's happy hour. The food was like warm even though we waited almost 20 mins. I'd look elsewhere for Mexican in Vegas. The stars are for the chips and guacamole and salsa.
