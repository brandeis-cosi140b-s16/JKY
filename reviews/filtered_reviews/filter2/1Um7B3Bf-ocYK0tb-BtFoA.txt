service was just slower than continental drift. never got our drinks or chips refilled. the waiter whispered to us every time he spoke. if you want to eat at the Silent Hill of Mexican restaurants, you can't do better than this place.

on the plus side, the distorted, ambient mariachi music and brightly lit fans kept my daughter occupied for the whole meal. +1 star
