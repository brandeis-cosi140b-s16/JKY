Ordered the guacamole and the first time it was too spicy even though we ordered mild. It came back better the next time and it included cilantro which gave it a good flavor. I like that they ask you if you want red onion in it, which we didn't. The service was very slow and an ice tea took forever to be brought out. Food was ok but with the slow service, will probably not come back. They have a nice outdoor patio with reggae music playing which made for a nice atmosphere, but the service needs to improve if they want to have repeat customers.
