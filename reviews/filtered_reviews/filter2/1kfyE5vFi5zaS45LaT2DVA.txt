This is a beautiful restaurant.  Too bad the management has let a good place slip down so far.  We have been eating here for several years.  When it first opened the service was good and the food was excellent.  It then transitioned to a place where the food was still excellent but the service diminished, but we would put up with the poor service because the food was so good.

Prior to this dinner on 10/12/12 we had eating there in August and the food was still very good.  Something happened between then and now and the food was just as bad as the service.

You are served three salsas with chips and all three were pretty awful.  It almost seemed like they had added sugar to all three. Pretty horrid.

Ordered nachos that were left in the broiler  too long and were burned on the edges. That wasn't the worst part however.  There seemed to be what might have been hormel chili con carne slathering about.  Pretty terrible nachos, which honestly, is not the hardest food to prepare.

We ordered rock shrimp enchiladas which were at the top of the price list. Instead of rock shrimp the enchilada was filled with bay shrimp, I kid you not. 

It seems more and more the restaurants in casinos are skimping quality hoping you don't notice. That recipe is not one that will keep a loyal clientele, which might explain why at 8:00 PM on Friday night the restaurant was no more than 1/3 full.
