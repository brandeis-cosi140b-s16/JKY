Living in the area, we had such high hopes for this restaurant, especially since there are few options.  Service is very slow, servers are pretty forgetful, and the food quality is lacking.  If you are in the area and hungry with no other choices, then at least you will be fed.  However, if you seek flavor as well as efficient servers, I would seek other options.  In my opinion (and I am a Chef) Mexican food is the easiest to prepare, so if you mess that up, I seldom hold out hope that I will return.  First impressions typically tell a story!
