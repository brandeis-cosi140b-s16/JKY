I was not impressed with the food!  It is not authentic Mexican food, which they don't necessarily advertise authentic Mexican food, but the salsa alone was disgusting, so I didn't touch my chips and salsa.  Their rice is gross as it tastes like paper.  Their beans tasted like can.  The chicken enchiladas were edible though, I did eat those.  The frozen strawberry was super yummy!  I think it bearly had alcohol though.
