I went in with some girlfriends on Friday night, we sat down at about 9:45pm and ordered a couple margarita's which were good and tasty. Unfortunately, that was the only good thing.  The female  wait staff all seemed like they were on drugs, just odd behavior and super fast and twitchy.  We ordered some tacos which were at best bland and really nothing to write home about.  The beans were good and the chips weren't bad.  It was also odd that the wait staff was using a table in the restaurant as their personal dining table.  Although it was winding down, it just seemed unprofessional.  I live downtown and won't be going back, So-Cal Fish Taco has way better food and service.
