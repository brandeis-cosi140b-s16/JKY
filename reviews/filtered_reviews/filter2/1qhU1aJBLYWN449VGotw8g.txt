Our hotel concierge recommended this place.  We sat outside under the heating lamps and the vibe was great.  The appetizers were quite tasty (seafood tacos were yummy while the chorizo fondue was not what we expected but still okay).   The entrees were not that great.  We only had to wait 5 minutes, but then it was also a Sunday night.   Portions are pretty large... we ended up doggy bagging half our entrees.
