Chips & Salsa were the only things that were good. Margarita on the rocks was ok, spinach dip was ok. Chese enchilada & chile relleno was ok. Husband had a chicken chimi, he did not like it but like the beans and rice. My friend from Canada like the beef enchilada & hard shredded beef taco.  Flan was tough.
