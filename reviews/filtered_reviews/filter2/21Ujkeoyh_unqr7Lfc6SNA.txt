This immensely popular and fun taqueria-esque restaurant in the South Side has no problem packing in the crowds.  It's amazing how many people they can squeeze into this small space.  It's a bit claustrophobic but people will put up with a lot to get their taco fix. 

The menu is fairly sized and there's a bit of something for everyone, yes, even vegetarians.  The short rib taco was surprisingly the weakest as the meat was a bit tough and rather bland tasting.  The chorizo taco was expectantly much more flavorful but a tad chewy.  My favorites were easily the duck taco and seitan taco both for texture and taste.  These are small little tacos and you certainly don't feel guilty about eating them.  Think taco tapas.  

The seemingly major drinks were their margaritas.  I'm not a tequila fan at all so I pretty much steered away from those concoctions.  The beer menu, albeit tiny, was adequate.  There were some interesting martinis though (thanks to Kevin Sousa's influence I'm sure).  There is always hope found in the form of a well made libation. 

Service can be painfully slow in between tacos.  They obviously need more servers to deal with the crowds and a waiting area especially.  They don't take any reservations either so you're left to chance in scoring a table coming here.  Luckily, prices are relatively low to moderate.  I'm not sure if I'd come back again.  The very idea of having to deal with that crazy line to have mediocre tacos just doesn't sit all that well with me.  Burrito anyone?
