I want to love Macayo's. At one time, I did. The service was below average, I think that the waiter was over loaded which I blame on the business, not him. The Chips were excellent, the guacamole was just average. The rest of the food was mediocre at best. i cannot, in good conscience recommend Macayo's anymore. There are much better choices for sit down mexican food in town.
