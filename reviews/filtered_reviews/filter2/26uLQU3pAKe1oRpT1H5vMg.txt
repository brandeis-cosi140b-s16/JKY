This place came as a recommendation from the hotel I was staying at. I should have trusted Yelp instead. I usually hit places that have 4+ stars on yelp when I'm out of town, this place had 3 1/2. And that was a little high. 

We showed up and were told the wait would be 15 minutes and they were dead on, no complaints there. Once we sat down we had to chase down a waitress for our waitress after sitting for 15m and having no one acknowledge us at our table. 

Once we got our service I found the food ehhh.
Salsa was good but I've had waaaay better in Chicago. The Tacos came highly recommended, again, ehhhh. Frankly, this close to Mexico I expected way better. I can go to a million restaurants in Chicago with better tacos and worse yet I've  been to Irish bars in Chicago that have better tacos. Sorry I'll skip this place next time.
