The restaurant decor is quite beautiful and eye-catching. Right away we were sat and greeted by the staff. The main dining room layout has an open kitchen, which can be entertaining but can be a downfall if you recognize your food sitting on the counter waiting to be served to your table. Happily, the service was exceptional! 
About the food itself: We ordered sushi, the mussel bowl, the soft-shell crab BTL, and the tacos al pastor. Here's the thing-- the presentation is gorgeous. But the food is lacking where it counts the most. EVERYTHING WAS BLAND! Granted, the sushi was tasty and well priced. A $65 bill was unjustified, in my opinion.
I've heard people rave about this place for months and I honestly cannot see why. Maybe it's because it is located in Scottsdale and the concept of a Japanese-Mexican fusion restaurant sounds new and exciting. When I heard people talking about it, I said, "Oh! Like Chino Bandido?" And the response I got was a snarky, "No. This place is not ghetto." Well, maybe I'm more attuned to a lower-class lifestyle. I would have rather gone to Chino Bandido.
