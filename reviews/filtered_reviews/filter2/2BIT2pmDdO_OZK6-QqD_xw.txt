The best I can say for this restaurant is that the service is friendly.    The food was so-so and very over priced for what you get.  I had the high desert pasta and there was barely anything in the bowl.  My husband had the stacked enchiladas and he got a lot of food.  When everything is said and done I would not recommend this restaurant, nor would I go back.
