So my fiance took me to Jaliscos tonight  and please believe me there was much to be desired. I started with a house Margarita which was good. I also ordered the Guacamole as an appetizer which had no salt  or flavor. For my entree I ordered the Street Tacos (one chicken and one steak) which again had no flavor. 

The staff is nice and attentive but, as for the food. I wont be back! The place was packed but I  truly have no clue why.
