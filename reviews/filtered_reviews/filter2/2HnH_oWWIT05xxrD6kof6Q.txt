I went here with a friend to try something besides Filiberto's for once.  We should have stuck to Filiberto's.  This place charges way more for a burrito that was nowhere near as large or delicious.  

We both got bean and cheese burritos, deciding against the guacamole because they charge $1 extra for it.  Most places it is half that.  We also found that rice is not an option.

When we got home, we found that our burritos were puny, floppy and understuffed.  They were reasonably tasty, but definitely not filling.  I could have eaten two of them, and I'm a light eater.

Definitely disappointing.  I wouldn't recommend it.
