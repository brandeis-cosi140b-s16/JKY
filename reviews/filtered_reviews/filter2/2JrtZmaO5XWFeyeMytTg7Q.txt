It was on Christmas evening and was my first experience I had to spit out the food, literally.  The scallops entree arrived more than half hour after the appetizers and were extremely salty and completely inedible.  I had to return it but decided to leave the restaurant as I had no patience to wait for another half hour for another dish.  The tacos appetizers however were very good, so was the service.
