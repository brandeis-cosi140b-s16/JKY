3 stars for the nice outdoor dining (when cool enough) area and the service but more importantly in this case 2 stars for most everything else.

Had one of their recommended margaritas and although the taste was nice and light for a warm evening there was a reason it was nice and light...I don't know if they pour extra warm ingredients over the ice then shake it up a lot for a watered down taste or if there is simply no booze in the drink but was extremely weak and my guest said his was the same.

I ordered the fish tacos of which there were three and they were just OK.  Served on tiny corn tortillas with a very small amount of jalapeno sauce and no roasted corn guacamole which it should have come with. My guest had the achiote ribs which surprisingly came as an entire slab. Neither he nor I were familiar with achiote sauce beyond knowing that achiote is a spice but even if we were we would have expected the "glazed with..." description to be an actual glaze and not a 1-inch thick bland paste. The ribs were tender just not as flavorful as one would have thought.

Overall the place was overpriced for the quality for food and beverage.  Disappointing.
