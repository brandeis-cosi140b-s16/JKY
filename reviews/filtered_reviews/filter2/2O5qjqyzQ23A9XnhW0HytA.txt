My inclination is to recommend avoiding at all costs. Draft beers - including swills such as Bud Light and what I not-so-affectionately refer to as that "headache in a can" Tecate - are $8(!!!), so unless you actually take advantage of the happy hour wheel offering drink "specials" or those $3 draft/"free margarita with an entree" cards (not to be confused with the hooker trading cards) handed out on the sidewalks along the Strip, don't expect to drink here on the cheap.

I can't, however, speak for the food, which I took a pass on for no other reason that I don't think tacos should cost $12. But maybe that's just me....
