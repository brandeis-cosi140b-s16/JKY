The only reason I am giving 2 stars, as opposed to 1, is that I have been here before and not had the problems I did on this visit.  The waiter was by far one of the worst I have ever had. It must have been at least 20 minutes between him taking our drink orders and coming back for our food order. When he finally did come back he acted annoyed at having to listen to our orders (no substitutions or special requests). It took 40 minutes for the first appetizer to come out, another 20 for the next and 20 more for the entr√©es to arrive. Not one time did he come by to ask if we needed condiments and we had to flag down a busboy to ask for silverware so we could eat. When he refilled our waters he actually slammed my girlfriend's glass on the table.  I know they were busy because of the beer festival but it wasn't exactly a surprise event, have people on staff that can handle a rush.

The chips and salsa was good though.
