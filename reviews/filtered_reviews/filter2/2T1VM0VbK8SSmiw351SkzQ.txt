Sooo much self loathing going on after eating here. Thank god for sweatpants and Tums.  This place is super gimmicky and the food was not good.  I couldn't believe the amount of people packed in here for subpar Mexican.  The portions are huge, which I guess is a plus for some... But I'd much rather have quality over quantity.
