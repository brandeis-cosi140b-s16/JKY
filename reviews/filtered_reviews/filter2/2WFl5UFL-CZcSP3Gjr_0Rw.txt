After hearing so much about Dos Molinos.. I was disappointed to say the least.  

First let me mention that the front door is on the side of the building.   Next, don't let them put you into that first table, which is incredibly tiny, especially if you're 7 months pregnant and eating with 3 men!  I'm only 5'2" but my belly was literally up against the table.  The guys were super squished too... so I had us move as there were plenty of other tables.  In trying to get out of the little booth, I sliced my finger on the staples that hold the fabric backing onto the wood chair back... nice.  They should fix that.  And... that should be the LAST table they sit people at.  

Let's move on...  Service was slow but we finally ordered.  I got the chicken chimichanga and a side of guac.  Well, I tried to get a side of guac but they brought us an appetizer of guac (which is more $$ of course).  That might have been ok since there were 4 of us but, it was terrible.  Really?  Yes... 4 hungry people and we didn't make a dent in our appetizer of guacamole.  It was somewhere in between an avocado (which I love) and guacamole (which I love) but somehow was still disappointing.

My chicken chimichanga had good flavor but there wasn't much to it.  The size was ok but it was basically just a deep-fried tortilla that was stuffed with chicken.  Meh... I'm over this place.  Maybe you have to come for the spicy food but I'm restricted on that right now because I'm preggo.

Won't see ya there!
