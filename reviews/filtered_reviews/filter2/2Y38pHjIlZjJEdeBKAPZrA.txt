I love Nando's we drove from Glendale to this location just to have the Pollo Rico and Let me say this the food was good but The service from the time we entered til we left was horrible.  No greeting from the rude hosts who kind of threw our menus at us because we were trying to sit down and she seemed like she was in a hurry. was not busy at the time we went 3 different waiters came to our table none took the order until about 15 minutes later then the waitress checked on us once the entire hour and half we were there. The food is always delish but this time the service sucked big time.
