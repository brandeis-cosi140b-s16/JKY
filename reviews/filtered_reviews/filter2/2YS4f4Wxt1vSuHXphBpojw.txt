This place bills itself as Mexican-Chinese fusion so I'm thinking yum!  Asian pork tacos?  Some yummy mexican egg rolls?  NO!  There is no fusion.  There is a mexican menu and a chinese menu.....blah.  Skip it!  However, my pomegranate margarita was delicious as was the salsa and guac so maybe just go for the snacks and cocktails!
