I was really looking forward to trying Leticia's after reading the other Yelp reviews, but our food was not good. There were 3 of us dining and 1 had the Milanese Chicken, which was absolutely horrible and almost inedible. The chicken was pounded so thin and pan seared that it was like a dried piece of chicken jerky.  The carne asada burrito was just okay (Cafe Rio is better and cheaper). I had the Taquito's, the potato and cheese was the only good thing about my dinner, the chicken taquito and the beef were both very dry and the meat was tough. Not including the tip dinner was over $60 (only 1 beer).  I would only go back for the potato and cheese taquitos.
