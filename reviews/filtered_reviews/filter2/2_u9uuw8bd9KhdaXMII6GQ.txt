The service was par and the food was far below.  I ordered a chimichanga and it was soggy, yet over cooked.  The salsa was average and the hot sauce was basically tomato sauce with red pepper flakes.  My gf had an enchilada which was average.  I will try it again but as for authentic Mexican I was very much disappointed.
