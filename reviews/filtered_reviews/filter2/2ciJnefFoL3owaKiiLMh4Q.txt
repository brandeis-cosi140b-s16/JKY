A disappointing slide over the past several months. The food is good. However, the poor service is what dominates the experience. You are clearly just part of the herd getting pushed through the line. The employees take no pride in keeping the restaurant clean or servicing their equipment-check out the drink machine that's been down for the past month. If you must eat Cafe Rio try one of the other locations-it will be worth the extra drive.
