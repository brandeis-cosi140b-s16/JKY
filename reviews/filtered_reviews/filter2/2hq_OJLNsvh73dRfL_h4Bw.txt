I was looking for the best Mexican in Vegas and this is what I got???
As every restaurant might say on the strip - we are the best! But lets classify the burrito as one of the worst I have ever had. I will have to say that the chips and guacamole was half decent, the rest of my meal failed to impress!
The burrito had more of a Texas / onion / ranch taste to it.  I was looking for more authentic, but I guess you get what you get in Vegas - imitation!
The service was OK, the bartender was more concerned about what she was doing later on in the night and her tip.
The ambiance was pretty good though - great lighting,good energy and slot machines on my table! 
Next time it's off the strip to find some "real" Mexican fare!
