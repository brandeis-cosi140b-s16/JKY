Pros:
- Beautiful architecture. The main room is very loud but if you sit in the front part of the former vestibule, it's much more pleasant.
- Good sangria.
- Friendly server.
- Tacos are good, the lamb was my favorite.

Cons:
- Expensive. I like America's Tacos just as much (and their corn is better) and my bill will be far less. Granted, not the same atmosphere, but come on, did Phoenix really need another place to get tacos? 
- Service was iffy. Our party of five was willing to overlook given the business is new, despite this being a concept restaurant from an established restaurant chain that one would presume has its act together. But the food did not come at the same time, served one plate at a time with about 5+ minutes wait  in between. Only the first person served (who politely waited and ate his food cold) got exactly what they ordered. Only I got my dinner delivered from our server. The rest was brought by mystery staff who weren't all that friendly.
- The charge for the bill was wrong. Our server blithely told us to pay however we wanted, so one of our party paid for two people and the entire tip. Two of us discovered the next day that the restaurant had charged each card 20% extra, effectively changing the amount from the signed slips.

The bottom line for me is, I would only go there again for an occasion. And I would take cash.
