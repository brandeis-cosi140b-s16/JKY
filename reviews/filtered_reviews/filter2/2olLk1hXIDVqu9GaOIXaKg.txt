The best aspect of Mundo is that it is inexpensive. You never need to leave a gratuity because the service is always terrible. 

The food is delicious, fresh, and well prepared. However, after the server takes your order you won't see them again until you ask the busser for the check. Then, the server drops it in front of you and doesn't say a word. 

I would like to say that this is a one-time occurrence, however, after three visits, we cannot be wrong. 

I wish they had take-out.
