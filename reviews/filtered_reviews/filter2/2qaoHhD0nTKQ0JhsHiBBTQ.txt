I grew up in AZ. I remember when it was Woody's! This place as a chain has been on a slow decline for a long time. Like a lot of places, it got a bit more pricey. But hey they have to make money so I get it. Then the plates got a little smaller. Well hey they got to make money I get it. The food got a little less spicey, a little more "gringo". I thought well yeah all the people from Ohio who moved here probably complained. But they finally did something that makes me say ENOUGH. We went here today and like always I ask for the hotter sauce right away. The kid brought some. Well that's what he said. He had a blank look on his face and NO PERSONALITY, so I was not sure if he messed up or was just slow or stoned. ANYWAY I kept looking at it. He finally said, "oh you think I brought the wrong stuff, no they changed the formula a few weeks ago." It looked EXACTLY like the regular sauce. He admitted it was not hot at all and he didn't like it either. I can not stand it. If you are going to make the food more bland you CAN NOT make the hot sauce the same. That was the ONLY stuff that made the food better than Taco Bell. So for two of us, with no appetizer and no alcohol it was 45 bucks with tax and tip. NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!
