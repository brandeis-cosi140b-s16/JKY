This place has a really cool concept going, it's an awesome layout and cool beachy vibe. Unfortunately, although the food is okay, the specialty drinks are no bueno-- way too sweet and hardly a hint of tequila... a downer for a place with a separate tequila menu!  The house margarita was a smidge better, but the rrrreeeaally loud music in there (especially for a social bar / restaurant, not a dance party) made for a place I'd recommend skipping entirely.
