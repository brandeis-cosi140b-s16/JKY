Expensive bland very Americanized Mexican food. Probably good for tourist who like mile Pace salsa FRM the grocery store. Probably what bothered me the most was all the rescued on expenses fur adding things like green chiles $1 onions $1 cheese $1.75. Our iced tea was $3. Not to of this works prices but kinda high. Service was ok, they got us what we asked for but without a smile or any enthusiasm. Beautiful location though!
