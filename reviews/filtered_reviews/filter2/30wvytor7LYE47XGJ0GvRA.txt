Came here on a Friday for drinks and had a great experience. Was looking forward to trying out the food so brought the whole family for Sunday lunch. Bottom line, no one will be going back a second time. The chicken and the steak tacos (corn tacos which are homemade)  were so soggy they fell apart on the first bite. The carne asada was burnt and the beans were filled with loads of fatty pork.  Chips and salsa were average but you are charged $3. I hope they are still tweaking the menu and will change the "family style" serving style. The portions are definitely not big enough to share and people get confused on who's food belongs to who.
