If only the service matched the food. Every time I go I feel like I am just bothering the employees. They show a lack of interest or excitement. The food is fantastic; don't get me wrong, but Backyard Taco needs some reconstruction on how to treat their clients. I once went up for a refill, waited 6 minutes just to be told "it's extra". I had no idea. I also don't feel like I should have been turned down and embarrassed. There are better ways to serve your customers and I just feel Backyard Taco doesn't know it yet.
