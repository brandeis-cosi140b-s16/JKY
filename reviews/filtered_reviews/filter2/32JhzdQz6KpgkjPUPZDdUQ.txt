Man, was I disappointed in this restaurant. 

I love On the Border.  Usually when I have gone here in other states, I love it. Not this spot. I always love the salsa and get the XX fish tacos. 

First, the wait staff was not very good.  When our food came, we asked for more salsa. That never came.  So we asked another guy and he brought it.  

We ordered the queso and guacamole. The queso tastes like cheap velvetta cheese. The guacamole was ok, but too many onions for my taste.  The salsa was still pretty good. 

The fish tacos were just not that good.  Too much cabbage and veggies and not enough sauce. They were bland. The rice was very good, but the refried beans were not. 

The waiter did ask how the food was and I made a sour face and said, meh...it was ok. He talked right past it to go get our check. LOL!  Guess he really didn't care. 

The manager came by because I had a groupon and when he asked, I told him we wouldn't be back.  I told him what was wrong and he apologized and gave us an additional $10 off. 

So I will give 2 stars since the manager, rice and salsa were all good. :) 
The rest wasn't. :(
