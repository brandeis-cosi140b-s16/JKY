Perhaps I had too high of expectations, but Tee Pee is no bueno. The only saving grace was the salsa, spicy and delicious. I ordered a bean and cheese burrito, enchilada style with extra garnish. The plate i was given spent way too much time under the broiler and the garnish (roughly chopped lettuce) was was wilted by the time it got to the table. The enchilada sauce was pretty bland, the beans runny and an overall grease taste superseded any other flavors. 

Aside from the food the booths are really uncomfortable. Maybe we should have sat in the restaurant area in stead of the bar, but looking around all the booths seemed about the same - lumpy lump. Meh.
