The girl who sat us wasn't too friendly she tried to sit us on the patio area without even asking, the Steeler game was on which is the only reason we picked this place (TV's, and Margaritas) and she acted like it was a sin to sit us in eye shot of a television smh...the hostess is the first contact a patron has if she's rude that kinda sux 

The food was okay for hotel mexican food 
Sampler platter, nachos (eeeh), chimi's (good), guac (yum), wings (blah), ceviche (worst I've ever had, sweet, kinda tasted like they put Italian dressing on it, very curious dish)
Americanized beef taco, rice n beans were cool, el pollo loco's seasonal tamales are better, beef and cheese enchiladas were okay. The chips n salsa, iced tea, and Cadillac margaritas were all very good, the bar service for our drinks was kinda slow ... but our server CHRIS was awesome all the way just super attentive sweet and patient... he went above and beyond for our party. Also i'd like to note we wen't against our servers suggestion of the fajitas or the tacos el carbon and went with something else so thats our fault (always listen to the server)

This place was okay i probably wouldn't come back there are so many good places in New York New York hotel let alone Vegas but i don't regret trying Gonzalez Y Gonzalez either
