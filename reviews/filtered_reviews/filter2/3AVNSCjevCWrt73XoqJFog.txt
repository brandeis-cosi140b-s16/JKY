Came in after the half marathon on 12/2/12 to celebrate and was very disappointed. The service wasn't that great, took forever to receive our drinks and food, and neither were very good. It was a fun atmosphere for the most part and that's why I am giving 2 stars. I was really hoping for more out of this place.
