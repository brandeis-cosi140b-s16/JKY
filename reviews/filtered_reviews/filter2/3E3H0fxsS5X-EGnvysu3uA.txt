This restaurant confuses me. Perfect example of bad fusion. It's not even really fusion since it's just 2 concepts in the same restaurant (you can get a taco and noodles). 

I had the open sesame which was ok. Not bad, not good but definitely not worth the $14. Friend has the pork sandwich ($10) that was TINY. And he got his meal 5 minutes before us and has already finished it before we got our noodles. Bad timing. 

The customer service was good, everyone was nice but overall was a weird experience. Just not worth the money.
