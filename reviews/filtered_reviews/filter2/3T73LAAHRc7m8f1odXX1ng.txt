Oh Mr. Frog,

I wanted to love you. I really did. 

I ate here for dinner with my parents today. The atmosphere was fun, the view  outside is great! We enjoyed the live band, and the friendly staff. Sadly, its the food that just wont afford me that third star. The venue and the atmosphere itself could've received three stars. But, sadly, here I am in my hotel room in Vegas, damn near curled up in a ball because I am retaining SO MUCH WATER from all the sodium in your food. My mom and I each ordered a chicken fajita plate, my sister a fettuccini alfredo plate, and my step dad a fish taco plate. My poor step dad didnt get to enjoy much of his meal because the rest of us defaulted to his plate because we couldnt stand the saltiness of our meals.

It didnt seem so much of an over-seasoning of a single plate or a mistake made in the kitchen, but that their food/seasoning is just crazy-salty. 

And to ice that with a $96.00 bill where none of us even ordered an alcoholic beverage....no thank you. I wont be returning. Sad too because it really does seem like a fun place, but...this is Vegas...
