I've only done take-out from this location and each time has been good.
I've always constructed the Pick 3 which seems to be the best deal going on the menu.
The Chimi is good with Chorizo (Mexican Sausage), you cant beat the enchiladas, tacos are good and the chips n' salsa are great.
This place does offer outdoor seating; its not a very big patio, but looks like it could be fun on a nice weekend night.
The portions are plenty big and the service at the bar has always been great for pick up.
