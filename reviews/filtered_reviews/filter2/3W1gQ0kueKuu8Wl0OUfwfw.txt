I understand this is the PHX Airport location, but it was NOT impressive.  I had the Taco Pescado  (fish taco) and it was very good.  
My wife had the Burrito, and it had pieces of PAPER inside! She ate about 1/3 of it before seeing the paper. Her 1st glass of water had a hair in it!!!

No reflection on the waiter because he handled the situation perfectly.  He knows how to treat a dissatisfied customer.  Thanks for your good service and understanding.   

The kitchen staff obviously needs to clean up!
