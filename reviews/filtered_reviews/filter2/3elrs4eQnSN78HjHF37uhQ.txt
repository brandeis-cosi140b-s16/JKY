Service dropped this from a 4-star all the way down to a generous 2-star review. 

The fajitas and fish tacos were average (could use a bit of zest), however,  the guacamole was delicious...once we could actually eat it. It took multiple servers at least 15 minutes before one of them brought us chips (we had to ask three different employees). Imagine the torture! It was a beautiful mountain of avocado, onions, cilantro, and lime juice in a stone bowl sitting right in front of us. Besides being "forgetful" about the chips, we had to ask two different people for napkins and silverware and our drinks took over 10 minutes. I considered giving them the benefit of the doubt, but it wasn't a packed house. On the contrary, it was 3pm and only a handful of parties on the patio. Overall, the service left us feeling neglected. Our server didn't come around to check on us and never asked how our entrees were (which we could have used limes). Side note, the salsa was great and you can make it hot to order.

The patio is a sweet place to be. Just be flexible to move your chair around your table as the sun sets on the Ritz Carlton. Open seating, spacious, and in the center of it all...nice!

If Vida can greatly improve communication between the waitstaff and train their servers to be more attentive and friendly this place would be a 4-star due to the location, the price, and the atmosphere.

The floors are cool looking, but beware if you arrive in tall heels, you may slip...yes, yes I did.
