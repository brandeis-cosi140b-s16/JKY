Thought this might be fun to try on a our trip to Vegas but I would definitely give this a miss. We ordered a lot of the dumplings (not great, and I know dumplings!), plus some noodle dishes, a soup (bland broth) and the Mongolian lettuce salad (the vinegar was overpowering and the sauce gluggy, as if it was out of a bottle).

We then had some tacos and these were much better (especially the carnitas and duck tongue). The Cosmopolitan seems to be full of hen's weekends so the restaurant was full of big bridal shower groups, not our scene.
