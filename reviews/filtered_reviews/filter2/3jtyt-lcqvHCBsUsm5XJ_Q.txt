Love the food but the service is alway slow. Got seated @ 5:39pm and the waiter didn't come to the table till 5:47. And we are seated at a booth right next to another one of his tables. He took the other parties order looked at us and left. Assuming he went to put their order in. Then came over to us. If it wasn't for the food I wouldn't come here. Never had good service here ever.
