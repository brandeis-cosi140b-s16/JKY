Not impressed. 

I got the shredded beef chimichanga with red chili for the 1st time, long wait (about 20 min, with only a couple of people waiting) and it was really good.  Went back a second time and was not expressed with the green chili, had to many big pieces of onions in my chimichanga.  I really liked minced onions and these were Not minced.  Maybe they should warn you about the onions!!  

The last time we went back the lady at the take out counter was not in a good mood.  we ordered a chimichanga with red chili and a smothered chicken burrito.  She told us it will be 45 minutes.  So we patiently waited for what we hoped was going to be good Mexican food.  45 minutes later we got our food and ordered was all wrong.  She gave us a chicken chimichanga instead of smothered chicken burrito and a plain bean burrito.  We referenced back to our receipt and it was not itemized, no details of what we ordered or what we were charged for.  It took another 30 minutes to have them retake and fix our order and then another 30 minutes to get our food. We waited 1hr 45min.  service was horrible and 8 dollars for a burrito that we waited almost 2 hours to take back home and eat... Will not be driving all the way to south phoenix for Ponchos.
