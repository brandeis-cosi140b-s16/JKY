Sat in the patio (soaking up the nice AZ weather)....  We had a retirement lunch here.  It was roomy and we can be noisy!  :)  The chips were good and crispy.  I got the chicken chimy, it was ok.  Almost flavorless.  I so wanted to LOVE this place but the food was just not that good.  The staff was nice!
