I've tried all kinds of mexican food from New Mexico, regular Mexico, back home in San Diego and many places in between. This is not any of that. This is crazy psuedo-mex from Miami or something. The only people they could fool are east-coasters and Las Vegas convention goers who get lured in by passing through all the time.

Everything tasted like lime. The corn tortillas were a pasty, dry mess and terribly under salted or not salted whatsoever. It's hard to imagine a mexican place that can screw that up. The truth is, however, real mexicans could not have had anything to do with concocting the food served here. This place exists to sell cocktails and $6 lime ades. 

If you're going to eat at Mandalay, head over to Burger Bar not too far away. If you're looking for mexican, go elsewhere.
