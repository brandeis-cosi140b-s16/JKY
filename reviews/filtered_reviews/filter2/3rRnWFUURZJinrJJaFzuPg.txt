Mass-produced mediocrity. I am not normally so blunt and so negative right at the start of a review, and yet this establishment seems best-described by this three-word opener. Crab cake appetizer was a cold bit of crab blended with a cold mass of filler, heaped on a confused mish-mash of greens, the best parts of which were the pseudo-Remoulade sauce and pumpkin seeds. Navajo taco special consisted of a few shrimp plopped into a mush of rice and cold black beans, all piled atop a cold and greasy slab of Indian fry bread. Hamburger ordered medium-well arrived rare. One good point, our server was very efficient and friendly, which made up in some part for the coldness of the greeter. Will not return.
