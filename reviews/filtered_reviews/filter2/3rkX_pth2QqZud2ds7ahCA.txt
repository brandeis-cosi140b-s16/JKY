I really wanted to love Cafe Rio, as so many people have told me how wonderful it is.  The line really took me aback, and they had only one cashier.  We went at 1:45 on a Friday.  The guys on making the food did a fantastic job.  Paying was a nightmare.  Food was cold by the time we were able to eat, even though we live only 10 minutes away.  Finally, they forgot my salad dressing, so my salad was bland and dry.  I will give Cafe Rio another try someday, so that I can discover what all of my friends are raving about.
