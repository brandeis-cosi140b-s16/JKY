I got the salad with steak, my husband got a steak burrito....."OVER PRICED", when we were ordering, we felt like we were being hustled! Everything you ad extra, is an extra charge.  more guacamole, extra charge, more salsa, extra charge, and extra dressing extra charge!  and they rush you through the line!  Feels like a cafeteria kitchen, the way you order.  It was ok, but not worth what there asking.  We ended up paying about $23.00 for a buritto and a salad w/ 2 drinks!  REALLY!  Noooooo sweetie, it's not that good.  El Pollo Loco, is just as good for alot less!  I think I will ask my co-worker that recommended this place to me, to give me my money back!  ROTF!
