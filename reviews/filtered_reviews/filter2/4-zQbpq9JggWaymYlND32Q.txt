I get the Roberto's craving from time to time and my weakness is their breakfast  burrito with bacon, extra bacon. I always get it with no potato or pico and little cheese and add guacamole. Though this is not my local store it is closest to work. On a two occasions they messed up my order. The line at the drive through is always slow. I have given up on this store and need to find a new morning fix.
