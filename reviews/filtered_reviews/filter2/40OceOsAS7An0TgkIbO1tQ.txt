I am giving 2 stars for the Free chips and salsa which were great. Service also was good. But the bad points fish tacos 3 small tacos lets say miniture best part was fresh tortilla fish was tasteless best part pico on it. Chicken and cheese enchiladas best part tortilla and maybe sauce on top not bad. But Chicken tasted like it came out of a can no flavor, no seasoning,no cheese or actual enchilada sauce on it inside the tortilla. My friend would not even eat his and he loves enchilladas, thats why we went there. We had a pitcher of Sangria's 45 dollars for the pitcher no fruit in pitcher one strawberry in each glass bitter tasting wine. One reason I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because they did not charge for my friends enchilada dinner. Prices are high but it is Las Vegas if the food had taste and flavor don't mind paying for it.
