First, let me say we loved the Aria. It was my second stay there within the year and it was a great hotel. But,  this restaurant we did not enjoy. The food arrived within mins of being ordered and quickly cooled, there is no way it was cooked to order. That coupled with $150 tab for two people (granted that included a couple of drinks each...still) was too much. The waiter was good/kind poor food not his fault and the chips and salsa were tasty and fresh - but not worth the price.
