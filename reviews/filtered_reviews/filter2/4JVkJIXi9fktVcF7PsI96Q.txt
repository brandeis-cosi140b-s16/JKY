The food was just eh. I only ordered a bean and cheese burrito, but it was just satisfactory.

The service was the worst part about this place. Our server, for some reason, was extremely rude to us the entire time we were there. She rolled her eyes at us a few times, and was very quick to respond (and at times didn't respond at all). The only time she said something halfway friendly was just before we were about to write in our tips. Go figure.

We won't be returning.
