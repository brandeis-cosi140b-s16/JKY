Drinks were ok. I asked for not very sweet but a spicy Cucumber Serrano so my drink was quite sweet w no heat.  I just got tequila  for the second one for 10 bucks. I ordered the veggie burrito to go with no aioli , put it on the side. Nothing came out on the side so I confirmed w my server there was no white magic (lime aioli ugh mayo) but I got home and it was smothered with it. So disappointing. I ate it and now feel ill because it just taste like mayo on a burrito. Exactly what I did not want. Also our bill was padded with an extra drink we didn't have. I won't be back. 

Nice atmosphere cool vibe.
