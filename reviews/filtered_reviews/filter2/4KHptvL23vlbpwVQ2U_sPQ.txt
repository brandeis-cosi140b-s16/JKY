This was our "go to" Mexican spot for the last few years, but they're slipping.  Went last night and the service was slow and confused...the noisy drunks at the bar were annoying...and the food wasn't nearly up to par...flavorless carnitas and the rice and beans were dried out and seemed to have been sitting on the plate for a while.  Very disappointing from a place we had reaaly enjoyed in the past.
