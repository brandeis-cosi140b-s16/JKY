I really want to rave about this place because there were some big positives. The patio seating was beautiful, the decor and art was awesome, and the whole place has this kind of upscale trendy fusion vibe. The burrito my husband ordered was seriously amazing--some kind of pulled pork that had fresh flavor and delicious sauce. 

However, our service was seriously lacking. We waited forever for everything, and she forgot out $11 table-side made guacamole. She wasn't around, so we had to ask a server at a nearby table where it was, and when she finally came to make it, she just kind of rushed through it and slammed it on the table. We asked for moderate spice and the guac was totally flavorless. The ingredients were of good quality, and I actually thought the addition of pomegranate would have been nice if we weren't essentially given a flavorless bowl of avacado hunks. 
I ordered the fried shrimp tacos, which were completely average. I ate one of the three and gave the rest to my husband.  

I should have known better than to order dessert, but I did it anyway--mostly because I was still hungry from not eating my tacos. I ordered churros, and it took half an hour to get one. freaking. churro. The server came up to us to tell us she was scared to come to our table because she knew it was taking way too long, and complained that she didn't know why they weren't done because all it took was for them to dump it in the fryer. When it actually got to the table, it was completely overdone. I didn't finish it. 

Hubby's food and margarita were solid, mine was mediocre at best, and the service was bad. I would give this place one more try, but I was pretty disappointed because it was recommended by several people.
