The only reason this restaurant gets 2 stars from me is because, the flan was delicious!

The food on the other hand, is terrible. The flatbread pizza is a burnt, very thin pizza with scattered vegetables with NO cheese. It was like bitting into a dry piece of wood.
We also tried the crispy shrimp tacos and they were OK. When you bit into it, you really got the taste of mayonnaise, which i do not like. 
The guacamole was surprisingly not good. It was kinda watery and too lemony/limey.

The actual restaurant was very pretty though. It was like a nice beach party house.
