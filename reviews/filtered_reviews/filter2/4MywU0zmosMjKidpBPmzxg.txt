my parents have taken me to coyotes ever since I was in my mothers stomach she craved Mexican food when she was pregnant. coyotes is so close to my house that it was perfect, my parents would always kick back and have a couple margaritas while I enjoyed my root beer and bean and cheese burrito. but unfortunately business started to go down the drain for coyotes, and their prices shot up. my family stopped attending. 

I went a few weeks ago with my bestfriend and the food I ate with my friend was mediocre at best. it was nothing like what it was when I was growing up. very disappointing.
