The pros of this place was our bartender with red hair that made us a great margarita pitcher!!! The food was good. 

The cons were that I was over charged by about $50 that was very inconvenient. I went here on a weekend and it didn't refund my money until mid week during the next week ! So BE AWARE that you are not over charged I had signed for one amount and they charged and my bank statement showed something different .
