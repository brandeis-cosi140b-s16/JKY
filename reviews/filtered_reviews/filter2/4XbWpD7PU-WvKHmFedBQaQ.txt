I was overly excited about this place, but the price doesn't reflect what you get. I mean what are two of the cheapest most common foods in the US? Chinese and Mexican.....and what two kinds of food can you usually get a lot of food for under $10? Chinese and Mexican.... so why would I pay $2 for chips, $2 for salsa, $2 for rice, and at least $15 for every other dish? I DONT KNOW!

I mean the service was great but the food was lackluster.

Over all a cool looking place that looks like it would fit between the South America and China expos at Epcot.
