Work in downtown area.  Happy to give La Comida a try for lunch.  Good food.  Price is about the norm for lunch around $15.  It is a nice place, looks good, service was great.

Problem is the music.  Really hard to enjoy lunch when you can't hear the people you are with.  The music was just really loud.  It might be great at night or on weekend, but during lunch there is a lot of talking between friends.  

The server was quick to agree and pointed out that the speaker was very close to the table.  She was able to get it turned down, but it creeped back up.  We were almost yelling by the end of lunch.

I liked the food, but it is not a great lunch place because it was just to hard to enjoy my companions and frankly that is really important.  We all agreed we might give it another shot, but if the music makes it hard to enjoy the company, we will just go elsewhere and save La Comida for nighttime.
