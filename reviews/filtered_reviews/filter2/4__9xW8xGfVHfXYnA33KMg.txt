Very dissatisfied with food.   The chips served with chips and salsa were stale.  We ordered the taco appetizer which was extremely greasy and the meat had no flavor.  I ordered carne adovado which had too much of a smokey flavor and wasn't spicy.  The only good things were that our waiter was very attentive and the happy hour margaritas were great.  We went there with a groupon and will never go back.
