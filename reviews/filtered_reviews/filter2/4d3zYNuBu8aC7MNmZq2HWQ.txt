I'm surprised by all of the great reviews on the food at Joyride. I visited last week with my son. I love the atmosphere, the service was great. The food however, was terrible. We had the nachos. very little cheese (not melted) and too much of a white sauce with a very strange flavor, did not enjoy them at all.  Also tried the carne asada tacos. The meat has a very sweet flavor, very noticeably sweet. When I asked about it, they told me the meat is marinated in orange juice and does have a sweet flavor. They traded them out for the shredded beef tacos which I also did not enjoy. The corn tortillas on all the tacos are soft and quickly become soggy so the whole thing falls apart when you try to pick it up. My son had the red chile tamales. Besides red chile, they also had strips of carrots and zucchini inside (not indicated on the menu). The beans had no flavor. We love mexican food but were so disappointed. Despite the fun decor and atmosphere, we would not go back. If you are looking for good, authentic mexican, this is not the place. It's nothing like Carolina's or La Canasta (very good simple authentic mexican food) - they can't even compete with Macayos. The chips were ok, didn't like the salsa though. In addition, our bill was over $30. I don't mind paying for good food but expensive for terrible food? Seems like the kind of place that gets a lot of one time customers.
