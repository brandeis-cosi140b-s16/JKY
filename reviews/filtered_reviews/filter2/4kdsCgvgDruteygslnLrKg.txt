This place is good but they're shady on the ingredients.  I'm a business owner, and giving a little extra to a buying customer is nothing compared to a bad customer experience.  The guacamole is $2 extra and they give you a tablespoon.  Really?  Wtf is that?  A whole avocado isn't $2.  I swear employees can be so retarded at times. 
The taco guy touched tortillas with his bare hands and then puts on gloves to cut the al pastor with a knife.  Are you dumb bro?  Put your gloves on before you touch the food.
I understand Mexicans are hard workers but their common sense lacks like a possum.

Might as well go to chipotle next time.  Their portions are bigger and ingredients taste better.  Plus the service is better.  
 
The only person smiling here was the broad cleaning tables.
