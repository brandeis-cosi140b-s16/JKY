Don't waste your money on this place.  It is grossly overpriced mediocre food.  This is not authentic Mexican food more like Americanized Mexican food gone wrong. The chicken enchilada were made of some shredded chicken mixed an odd tomato sauce/seasoning. It was NOT good and the portions were too small for  the price. The fideo that came with the enchiladas was a disaster.  

I will say that the kids menu portions were huge.  A really large taco and a really big bean burro were the best deal there.  The kids price was definitely cheap considering the size.

We didn't have any alcohol so I can't comment on that but either way stay away from  this place it's not worth your money.  We ordered a fajita plate, two enchilada plates, two kids meals, and 5 sodas and our check was almost $ 90. Considering food was NOT good this was a waste of money. Our server was very nice though.
