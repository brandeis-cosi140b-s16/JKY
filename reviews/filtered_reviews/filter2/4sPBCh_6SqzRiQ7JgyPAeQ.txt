First off, where are you supposed to park? We found a spot in the back in a tiny parking lot, which then put us in the back entrance of the restaurant which is set up like a long narrow house. We had a group of 7 - and they put us in what I guess would be the living room with bookshelves, a fireplace and a few small tables. Which is unique, but where are we supposed to eat? 

I ordered a $10 margarita - it was ok. A little tart for my liking. And we all shared the trio which was guac, queso & salsa. This would have been better to share if we were sitting at a table! We all ordered some tacos and honestly no one was impressed! They were fine, but Ive had better. The prices were a little on the high side so not sure we'll be back.
