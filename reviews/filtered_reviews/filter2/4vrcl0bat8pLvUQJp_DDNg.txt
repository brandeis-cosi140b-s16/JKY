I'll start with the good- the tortillas and the nice ladies at the checkout. Now the bad- really fatty meat in the carne asada tacos; you might have a few decent bites, but eventually you're going to get a chunk of fat that you'll have try to discretely spit out in front of your friends and family. The al pastor has a bizarre too-red color that I've never seen in al pastor tacos in Mexico. I'm not sure if it's dye or something better, but I'm a little afraid of it. The line/ordering system- this is truly terrible. There are three lines for the different kinds of tacos. You can't get all three in one line and the lines are REALLY long. People shamelessly try to cut in front of you in line. Not really a pleasant experiences and the place isn't cheap.
