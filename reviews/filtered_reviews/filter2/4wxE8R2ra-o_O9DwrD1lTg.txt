Great margarita and chips. Delish corn app. The rest of the food and service was subpar, unfortunately. Our order was taken to the wrong table, apparently, but no one thought to tell us. We waited and waited, and finally were able to snag our waitress to inquire about our order. She said she'd just inquired and that it would be right out. Waited and waited, still no food. Waitress avoiding us, finally go find her & ask again. She says she has no idea why food not out but manager will speak with us. During all this, we have food from 3 other tables brought to us in error. Our food finally comes out. Salad warm, beans and rice cold.  Manager finally comes over to sort of apologize. Has an attitude even though we had been only waiting for food - not fussing or getting mad. Waitress still avoids us and we have to flag her down for bill.  Frustrating and not particularly good. They did comp 2 desserts.
