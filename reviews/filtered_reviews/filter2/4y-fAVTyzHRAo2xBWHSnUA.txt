The salad at Chipotle is something that I crave often, and the salad dressing is amazing.  However, if you go to this location you will probably not get salad dressing-because they will be out and they do not want to take the time to make more.  Also, don't expect a lot of lettuce in your salad. At this location they are often either out of lettuce or getting so low they do not want to give you too much or they may have to go get more from the back.  This is the closest location to my house, so I went back tonight after staying away for a few months.  I ordered two salads and had to ask three times for more lettuce.  Then after my order was pushed down to the next person, they told me I had to wait while the filled all the other condiments in their area-there was no one behind me so I am not sure what the rush to fill all of those was about.  Then I get to the end to pay and ask for the salad dressing that they were supposed to give me at the beginning of the line.  They only had one salad dressing left.  I was told it would take a LONG time to make more, but they did not even offer to make it if I was willing to wait.  The cashier seemed incredulous that I only wanted to take one of the salads since there was only one salad dressing. Apparently I look like the type who is so healthy that I eat salad without dressing-not.  It isn't like there are any other options for dressing-they only have the one kind.  So I left with one salad for my daughter, and I went and gave another establishment my business.
