Two things,First  I will NEVER understand a restaurant when you tell them "it's my first time here" and it just flies by their head. Please, check back, "did you like the food?" "Come back." "Here is a sample of something you didn't try." Nada! Off my soapbox.

Ok, if your a Mexican food place the spicy thing on your menu should not be the potatoes. Food was very bland, mushy, and seemed to have been sitting there awhile. Comparisons to chipotle for ambiance are accurate. 

I will go back in a few months to see if its gotten better, it's a great concept. 

Side note: upon walking up, you are smacked in the face with the smell of fish. It's from a pond nearby, come mid summer it's going to STINK!
