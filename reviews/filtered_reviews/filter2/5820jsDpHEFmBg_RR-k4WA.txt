Hungry after clubbing.  Whole group wanted tacos.  We asked the taxi people at Encore and they told us to go here, but to be aware that it's next to Sapphire.  Not inside, but literally next door.

Came in, sat down and got waters all around.  We then got chips and salsa.  We wanted more chips and salsa since we got two baskets for 9 people.  It would be an extra 2 dollars.  No, thanks.

I got the Chicken Milanesa.  Others got burritos and tacos.  Some liked it, most didn't.  Pretty pricey for okay Mexican food.

Finding a taxi was difficult leaving because of all the people wanting to leave next door at Sapphire.  Other than that, eh.  Go elsewhere.
