Our group reserved a large number of tables, and for the number of people we had dining at once, the waiting staff did an awesome job. Decor was great, fast service, top notch customer care. With that being said...

...I really, really, REALLY was disappointed with my food. The chips and salsa are great, but I ordered one of the "Favorite" enchilada plates, and couldn't force myself to finish it. My friend ordered the  la parrilla dish so I snagged a quick bite. The chorizo was really spicy and the steak was good, so I must have just gotten the bad luck of the draw with ordering something new.

All in all, I wouldn't mind coming back, but this time I know to order whatever food that the restaurant is named after.
