This place is only for cocktails on the patio for the nice local. The menu was nothing but heavy-heavy dishes in the heat of Spring they need to lighten the menu options. I mean really- Rack of Ribs, Steak, Stuffed Chicken and some other options that weren't very good. 

Don't get me started on the staff!  Our waiter was arrogant and uninformative. If you don't want to be known as a Mexican restaurant maybe you should change the name....last I looked tortilla's were strictly a Mexican dish. So what kind of restaurant is it?  Over priced and living on it's historic name and local. 

So if you go for drinks, I'm with Noah the house margarita is the best and it packs a kick so be careful!  My friend had the fancier version and didn't like it as well as the house.
