Soooo disappointed this time around.Paid $5.25 for guacamole and chips...thinking an authentic Mexican restaurant can succeed in this...nope...I rather go to Chipotle for chips and guac for $1.50 with better quality. 
To start the guacamole was watered down slush.
As I continued to eat it I found something in my guacamole and a burnt French fry in my chips...eww.
