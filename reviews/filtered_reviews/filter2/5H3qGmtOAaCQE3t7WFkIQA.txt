My daughter and I went a month or two ago. 

1. It's way out of our way but we went because we love burritos, we were in the neighborhood, and the place has some pretty good reviews here on Yelp.

2. I got a chicken burrito and she had a bean or veggie burrito. The burritos were good but not fantastic. (Maybe it's why I forgot to Yelp about it until now...)

3. Neighborhood parking was hit or miss. I drove around the block a few times before we spied a space in the lot near the outdoor seating area. The parking lot is fairly small and maneuvering in it gave me the jitters. 

4. The place didn't appear to be the cleanest. We had to wipe our table and seats before sitting. Several tables had trash and food strewn on them...
