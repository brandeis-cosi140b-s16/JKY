I don't know if I'd ever go to Macayo's if it didn't have $2 Dos Equis and a free buffet on Fridays. The food is your typical Mexican chain food. The patio is huge which is a plus between 75 and 95 degrees after that it gets pretty torturous. All in all, it's an alright spot to crash out with friends after work on Fridays.
