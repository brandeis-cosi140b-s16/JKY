I will admit, the Clarendon has done a good job with updating their hotel, but my restaurant experience kind of killed it for me. I was very surprised to see how busy it was because the last time I was there, it was completely dead. You can tell that they renovated and updated their restaurant area. Upon being seated, my husband and friend and I ordered some beers to get it started. We perused the menu to make our selections, and I was torn between getting the chicken burrito or the Naco Torta. I found out later that I should've gotten the Torta as that is what my husband got and when I had a bite it was delicious. Upon eating my chicken burrito, I found that whoever had cooked it had charred it so bad that the only thing I could taste when eating it was the char. There was no chicken flavor at all. The first part of the burrito was good, but the middle and later half of it I didn't even touch because of the charred taste. The menu also said that there was going to be salsa on it but I didn't taste any salsa. It was beans, avocado, cheese and charred chicken. I even tried to tell our waiter about my issue with the burrito, but all he said was "okay" and took the plate away. There was no apology, or correction on our bill for my meal at all. That was disappointing. We were very excited to try this place and while my husband and friend's meal were fabulous according to them, my burrito was pretty terrible. Also I got a side of rice and all they did was stick it on a plate which made it colder quicker as were sitting outside. I don't know why they wouldn't put it in a small bowl to keep it warm but for some reason that is the way that they choose to display their food. I am definitely not impressed and I will definitely not be returning. I was also bummed to see that they charge $3.50 for chips and salsa. Call me old fashioned but free chips and salsa are a pretty standard staple in many if not most Mexican restaurants in Phoenix!
