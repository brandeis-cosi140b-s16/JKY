I came with a group during Sunday brunch to avoid the lengthy waits at some of the other Scottsdale restaurants and was unimpressed.  It's a trendy little spot in the Saguaro hotel. Our service was very slow which I normally wouldn't complain about but we were one of 3 tables in the entire restaurant. 

They had a $30 buffet going but we decided to order off of the menu. I would say the food was decent. This restaurant seems like a good place for hotel guests that don't want to stray too far from their stay but there are a lot of other options in the Oldtown area.
