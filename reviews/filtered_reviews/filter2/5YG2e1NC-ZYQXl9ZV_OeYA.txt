Go with someone who speaks spanish. Food was good but had no idea what the heck was going on. I didn't even know where to stand. What the hell did i  even order. Greasy greasy greasy food. I love greasy fries and burgers, but this was extreme. I mean your mouth gets a grease coat every time you bite into the carnitas. Gnar man... super gnar.

Expect Stomach problems if you don't eat a lot of greasy food.
