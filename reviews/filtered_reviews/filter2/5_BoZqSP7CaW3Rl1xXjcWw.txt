This place is a real feast for the eyes. We sat right in front of a water feature that ran the full length of the front dining room. And the service was exceptional. But the food? A solid meh. I'd give them a meh+ for the great, friendly service.

They do tableside guacamole which was pretty good. I expected a little more presentation however. If you aren't going to do that, just schlep it out from the kitchen like everything else. 

Carnitas were rather tasty but no real depth of flavor. For a "signature dish" my level of expectation was much higher. Churros! Get them!! Served warm with banana ice cream and caramel sauce. You don't want to miss these. Do like we did and stop in just for the churros. You'll thank me.

Compared to most of the restaurants in Vegas their prices weren't too high. But there's way too much great food in Vegas these days. I can't imagine this is Diego's A-game.
