Probably the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Couldn't make through half of the chile relleno. Also the service was not great. She didn't inquire at all why we hadn't finished. The margarita had no alcohol in it. 45 dollars for sub par food, bad service, and a weak drink. 
The only redeemable aspect was the very sweet and kind hostess.
