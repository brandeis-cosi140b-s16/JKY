This place was strange. One area super bright like an operating room and the other area super dark. We sat in the dark area. 

I had the fajita burrito which tasted more like a pot roast burrito. Pretty gross considering I wanted a fajita burrito. 

Chips and table side guac +salsa were good. My recommendation would be to come here for a beer and a snack. Not for a meal.
