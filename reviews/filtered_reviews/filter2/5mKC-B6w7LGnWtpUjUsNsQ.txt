Im rating this on a vegetarian stand point so for you meat eaters the experience will probably be different. That being said, i also thought that the overall quality of the food is not so great. For vegetarians there is only one filling option, sauteed spinach and mushroom and it is kind of like baby food in texture. The red sauce has chicken broth init. I got 2 corn enchiladas. The enchiladas themselves were bland. Ifi hadnt added extra quacomole, coleslaw, cheese, crema, and salsa to it, it would have been very boring. Pretty much youre paying for the toppings. If youre vegan you are even more limited. You could only have salsa and guacomole and onions. The chips and salsa though were really good. I could have made a whole meal out of the chips. The service was great. The person serving me was very kind about taking me through it step by step and making sure i got vegetarian items. So i wont be going back. No point in paying for guacomole and salsa and cheese and chips and stuf when I could make that all myself or get it all from safeway or something in bulk for the same price.
