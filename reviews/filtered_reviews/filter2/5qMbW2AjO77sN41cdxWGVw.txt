Came with a party of 8 to watch a baseball game. Food was alright, vibe was good, but when it came time to checkout we waited for over 45 minutes. I have never experienced anything like it. We weren't given an explanation and were left to sit haplessly waiting. Eventually a manager came out and said the machine was broken, at which point We should have asked for our cards back and left without paying. I won't be back and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
