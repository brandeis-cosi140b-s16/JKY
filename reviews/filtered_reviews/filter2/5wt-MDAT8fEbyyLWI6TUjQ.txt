This Loco Patron location just opened this week so take this review with a grain of margarita salt. They could very well improve.

I'm a sucker for good margaritas and have seen the signs announcing this joint for months, so when I saw it open I had to take a look.

My first impression is that they've built a nice little sports bar, but furnished it like a Mexican food joint. TVs all over the wall and bar, saccharine pop/rock playing over the speakers, and a rustic cabinet where they keep straws, napkins, and the servers' purses. It's a medium-sized place, not big enough for a huge crowd, but it'd likely handle about half an hour of a pub crawl stop before the place got uncomfortable and folks moved on.

I sidled up to the bar and asked for a house margarita and a menu, both came back quickly along with a free mini-basket of chips and salsa. The salsa was actually really good, mild for the gringos but just a little kick on the backend. The margarita, on the other hand, was pretty awful. It had the right color, but the guy at the bar used way too much sweet and not nearly enough sour. It tasted like a flat sprite. I also couldn't tell if there was actually alcohol in there, which is never a good sign.

I ordered fajitas and those were also a little sweet for some odd reason. Maybe not enough salt when they cooked it up, I don't know. In any case, it was edible but not at all remarkable. 

When the bill came the barman rang me up for the wrong dish, overcharging me, but when I pointed out the mistake he quickly fixed it so no real harm done.

Mill Avenue has a bunch of existing Mexican food places, all with their own charms, and I don't understand why a business owner thought Mill Ave. needed another. So far these folks aren't doing anything which sets them apart from the others and I'd be surprised to see them still open this time next year. That said, I'd welcome improvements that prove me wrong. The ball is in your court, Loco Patron.
