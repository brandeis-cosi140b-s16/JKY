This was the worst Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. We had to buy our chips and salsa ($4.99) and the chips were cold and stale. I ordered the fish tacos and asked for flour tortillas, our waitress explained the only flour tortillas they have are the larger ones and warned me that the fish will look small on it. Really? A tortilla factory and you only make flour tortillas in one size?! She was right the fish was small, each of the three tacos came with a small strip of fish...worst fish tacos I've ever had. My daughter had the mixed tacos that came with steak, shrimp and chicken and she enjoyed them...which is my only reason that I didn't rate this place just one star. Not only was the food a disappointment but the place was a dump. Skip this place and Old Town all together.
