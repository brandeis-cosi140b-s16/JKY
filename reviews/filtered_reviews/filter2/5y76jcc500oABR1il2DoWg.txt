As a former Dallas-Fort Worth resident, I was ecstatic to see one of my all-time favorite restaurants come to my new home of Phoenix.  Sadly, this is not the Fuzzy's I knew and loved.  The menu and ingredients were the same, but the somehow the execution was just off.

I had my usual order with a shredded pork soft taco, shrimp tempura soft taco, and a corizo/egg/cheese breakfast taco.  The main ingredients, pork, shrimp, and chorizo and egg were as I remembered, cooked just right and very flavorful.  That's where the similarity ends, the fresh tortillas I remember were either leftovers or have been replaced with mass produced.  The toppings that should be a perfect mix of lettuce, feta, cilantro, sauce, etc. were reduced to 99% lettuce and added nothing to the tacos.

The second star is earned only for the fact that the hot sauce hasn't changed, (it's fantastic but I should have bought a bottle so I wouldn't have to go back there again) and it appeared they still serve beer in the frosted goblet (although it was lunchtime and I had to go back to work so I did not partake).

I hope this is just growing pains for the franchise and that they can bring this place up to the standards of the DFW locations.
