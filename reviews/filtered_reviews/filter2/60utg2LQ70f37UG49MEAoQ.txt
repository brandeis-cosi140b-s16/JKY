Why oh why isn't their decent food in the SW Valley? I really wanted to like this place- went for lunch today. Service was not good at all. The wait staff was inattentive and lazy. They don't give you dishes for chips and salsa. The waitress brought our food out and was holding our hot plates with a dirty blue towel. The food was tasteless which was a big disappointment because the menu choices were decent. The food was bland- I had the chile relleno and the spinach enchilada- no flavor. House margarita was watered down and too sweet. Won't be back.
