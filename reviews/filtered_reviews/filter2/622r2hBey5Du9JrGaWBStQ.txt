After reading the reviews on yelp and then eating there I am losing my faith in the collective wisdom of yelp.
First the chips and salsa; very bland and watered down salsa. Next the chille relleno; tasteless. I have had better tasting Mexican food in Berlin, Germany. 
Service was friendly and a good Margarita. Inecpensive as well.
