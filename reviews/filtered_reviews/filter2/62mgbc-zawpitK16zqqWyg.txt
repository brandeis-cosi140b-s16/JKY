We've eaten at Casa Reyna on four occasions and the food has always been pretty good. The tacos are pretty good, as well as their various salsas. Explore the salsa sampler and you won't be disappointed. As expected, the chips and tortillas are both excellent.

For atmosphere, Casa Reyna is also a nice place. You can tell that they took their time getting the restaurant ready. The murals, the decor, the vibe...awesome. The only downside? Don't be surprised when you get zero cell service in the restaurant. The plus side? You'll finally be able to focus on your actual restaurant experience since you won't have the outside distraction. Unfortunately, the lack of distractions also means that you'll KNOW when something is off...and that's why this rating is so low.

Service may have only been bad on our last experience, but it was infuriating enough to make me not want to return, despite the other decent experiences. When we order a skinny margarita on our first four visits, it's safe to say we MIGHT know how they taste. We MIGHT have been told how they make them by the previous waitstaff upon asking. As customers, we MIGHT be "right," regardless of whether the bartenders agree or not. The simplest approach is to work with us to make our drinks enjoyable. Make your customer happy...you know...so we stick around and want to return again and again. Not argue with us. Not try to act like we may be stuck paying for a drinks that we barely took sips from. We stopped in to watch the World Cup, get a few drinks during the game, and enjoy some tacos. Instead, the arrogance of the bartenders made us walk out the door, disappointed, and with our money remaining in our pockets.

Hopefully Casa Reyna tightens up the bar service, but I don't see us checking back in to see if it's improved.
