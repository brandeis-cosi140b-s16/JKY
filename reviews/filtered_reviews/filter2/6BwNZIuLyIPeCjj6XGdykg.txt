I'm feeling generous today, so I'll give two stars.  Probably closer to one.

I was flying back to the LA area and hadn't eaten anything all day, so when I got to the airport with lots of time to kill, this was the first sit-down option available with a table.

I ordered a coke with a taco salad with steak.  The coke was OK but crazy expensive ($3.60).  The salad came and had some scary looking steak in it.  I took a picture with my iPhone ,but haven't uploaded it to Yelp yet.  I will later.

The flavor was rather bland.  The guacamole looked packaged and overall it wasn't very good.  The entire meal was kind of nasty.  I should have gone to burger king!

Just say no to Jose Cuervo.
