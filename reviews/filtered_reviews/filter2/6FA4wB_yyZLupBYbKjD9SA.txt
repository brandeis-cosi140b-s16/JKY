Cafe rio has great food, but they can never seem to get my order right when I place it through the phone. They don't listen to your specifications and when I ask for extra of anything, they charge but don't provide. I let the manager know that this was the third time they had made my order incorrectly, but she only offered to remake it, when I had told her I was in a rush, hence why I placed the order over the phone. My coworkers also complained that theirs were made incorrectly. You would think they would comp you a meal or something of the sort rather than trying to make you wait for something that should've been made right the first time. If their food didn't taste so good, when made correctly, I probably would not return or recommend it to anyone else.
They definitely have poor management.
