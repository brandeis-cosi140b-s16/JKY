The pictures on here were kind of deceiving for me, which is disappointing! I was looking for a new place to get a veggie or bean and cheese burrito that was open somewhat late, it was between here or trying the new Senor Taco. Wish I would have tried the other place, because this didn't really meet my expectations.
There are a few things I did like about SomeBurros. For example, it was very clean, and the interior looked much nicer than I had anticipated. I also liked that it was inexpensive and they gave us chips and salsa.
The people working there were not all that friendly. They were not awful or anything, just not the friendliest. I ordered a Veggie Burro, was glad that it was inexpensive. Chips and salsa were ok, the salsa tasted a bit like tomato sauce to me which seemed strange, but it was not terrible. When my burro came out I was not too pleased. I mean, shouldn't expect much for a $5 burro, but I did expect better! The lettuce and tomato that was served with it was looking kind of gross. The burro was super bland. Like even the salsa did not help much. Just lacked flavor. Also I do not think it was big enough to be considered a 'burro'. I ate it all and was still kind of hungry afterwards. I did like that the avocado was fresh though, there was one positive.
Overall, my experience was meh. Probably would not go back here to meet my Mexican fast food needs, but it was not the worst culinary experience.
