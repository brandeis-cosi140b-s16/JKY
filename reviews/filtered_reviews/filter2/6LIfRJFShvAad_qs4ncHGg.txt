The plus side... open late. Do not go there if your expecting Mexican. Our food came out quickly, but still managed to taste like it was under a heat lamp for 15 min. The chips were definitely out of a bag, and the salsa was an effort on their part. Almost everything was an effort to eat. The only things standing between them and TGIFriday is the "flare" and the cactus for a door handle. Oh, and I guess TGIFriday probably wouldn't be playing any Fujia & Miagi - you know, the typical Mariachi.
