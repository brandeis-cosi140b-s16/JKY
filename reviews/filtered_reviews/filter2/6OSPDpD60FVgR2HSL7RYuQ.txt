This is the first AZ location for this chain and it just opened a couple of days ago. Unfortunately, I'm left with mixed impressions about my first experience here.

It's a casual restaurant where you order at the front and then you can either eat inside or get it to-go. I went the to-go route and ordered their taco plate. Prices are pretty good, with the taco plate running around $7 for 2 tacos and your choice of 2 sides. I got the grilled fish taco and grilled shrimp taco, both in the soft option (which means you get a soft corn tortilla). For my sides I got their rice and black beans.

First off, the tacos were good. They're unique in that they use feta cheese which adds a nice saltiness. The shrimp taco was my favorite of the two -the shrimp were seasoned nicely and weren't overcooked.

Where they missed the mark though was on the sides. The rice was undercooked to the point where some of it was still hard, which completely distracted from any decent flavor it had. The beans were good flavor wise, just watery, which I don't love... but this would have still been ok except for the fact that I found a hair in my beans :(

Their hot sauce is good though and was a nice surprise. I would have loved it on my rice if the rice wasn't undercooked. The hot sauce has a tangy, almost-buffalo style quality to it, with just the right amount of heat.

Since this is only their first week being open though, I would be willing to go back and give it another try and hopefully some of the issues will have been worked out.
