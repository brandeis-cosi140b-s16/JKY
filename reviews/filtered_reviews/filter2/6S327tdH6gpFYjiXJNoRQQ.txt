I'm agitated by the time I sit down with my food. 

So many different eateries I go to, I understand the delivery system. Self-serve, buffet, seat yourself, order/pay at counter then take that thingamajig number to your table, and of course my favorite, full wait help service! But at Taco y Taco, I look at the menu board, see the different ordering stations, the cashier to the side, and I don't understand! I do understand, I just don't see how it's a good system. 

So if I wanted an Al Pastor taco, I stand and wait in that line, then if I want a quesadilla for my son, I wait in this other line, order, and wait for that.  Which line is to order the corn? Each station has a couple of guys back in that general area, but you don't know who takes what order, you just wait till someone asks you or make eye contact with one. So finally, I pile all my food onto a tray and make it to the cashier line, wait, pay, then wait at the salsa bar line. Yes, I'm serious. Hallelujah, I finally get to sit, only to realize I forgot my napkins. Where's the napkins line?

I've tried this location twice. I won't review the food, because I don't think I've tasted enough of these tacos elsewhere to know how good they are comparatively. Food was ok, I don't crave any to go back in a hurry. Plus, I've heard about their recent health demerits. 

I appreciate  the music and the vibe, and that they offer vegetarian options. I liked sitting upstairs and prices are reasonable. Will I be back? Probably not. I'm not on the Taco y Taco bandwagon, but I'm ok with that.  I'll go look for a taco shop where there's only one line.
