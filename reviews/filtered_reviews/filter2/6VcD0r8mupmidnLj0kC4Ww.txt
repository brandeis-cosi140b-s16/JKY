My wife and I are Vegas locals and Mexican food is a favourite. When South Point opened its new Mexican restaurant we had to give it a try, especially as it is only a short drive.

The first thing I noticed about Baja Miguel's is that it looks more like a cafe than a Mexican restaurant. The colours, decor and layout of the tables doesn't make for the most intimate setting.

Before our meal we were given Salsa, bean dip and guacamole. I can't comment on the guac since neither of us like it - The salsa was good but the bean dip was revolting.

I ordered the shredded beef nachos and my wife had cheese enchiladas.  The best way I can describe the food is "Pedestrian" - sort of like what you would expect at a chain restaurant.  The beef on my nachos was a bit sloppy and my wife described her food as "ok, but nothing id ever crave again".

In a city with so many cheap Mexican options, give Baja Miguel's a big miss. The food is OK, but when you have similarly cheap fare all over town, usually of much higher quality, I don't see any reason to go here again.

On the plus-side, drink service was sensational and the staff looked after us well.
