Chino Bandido.  Very unique restaurant.  You wont find anything else like it.  Fusion between Mexican and Chinese cuisine.  And with practically all the entrees or combinations available, you will be aware of the mixtures of tastes when you eat.  Maybe I appreciate the concept in a personal way, as I am a creation of a Jewish father and Indonesian mother.

When you first walk in - you will quickly note that ordering procedure is goofy.  Fear not because they have a special side station where they take in new people, offer tasters of all the dishes and help you with the process.  Thinking like a good process engineer, I can envision better efficiency but I suppose this works for the staff who I'm sure have been working there for a long time.  Rather than thinking about a thousand possibilities, I figured out that I will take #1 & #7 (jade red) with some sort of fried rice w/o beans, every single time.  And I suppose there isnt too much Mexican about that choice.

So why do I give it a 2/5 star rating?  First, I can always count on enduring an MSG bomb moments after absorbing the meal.  I hate that.  Second, after seeing the Food Network "Diners Dives Drive-ins" special about the restaurant, I now have seen what makes the food taste so good.  Lets just say lots of the saturated fat content that I typcically try to avoid.  Finally,  its not cheap.  On the positive, at least after eating the entire contents of the silver pie tin, no one leaves hungry.

ps.  If big, cheese, greasy, and tasty is what you are thinking - I suggest having the #2 chile rellano.  You wont be disappointed.
