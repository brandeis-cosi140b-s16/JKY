Wow. 
SO...Finally getting a chance to visit this spot since the change over from Firefly. Ok, here's what was good. The food tasted right, nothing muddied in the flavors and clean executions with seasoning. "Mexican" style food can often get a lil crammed in with too much going on. You can tell that quality marinades, and proper prep work went into the grub here. The beer selection is really good. Always a steady rotation of quality beer and good drinks. 

Here's what's often not good : the service. I have actually had servers that have been employed there since it was the previous restaurant - Firefly - tell me that they were new employees. They did this because they had forgotten orders. Not ordered our food .. And in one event, the server was dancing in front of the Dj while we waited for our check for over 15 minutes. 

Telling the manager about the issue did nothing. The manager was combative with us trying to defend the servers mistakes when we asked for nothing other than the check.  The tall Latino, male night manager we dealt with, went so far as to lie and say we had been using profanity against the server - as if to say that any other mistake made by the server - was invalid. No such thing happened. 

I want to support local business and I wanted to be a regular diner at this establishment. That kind of behavior is unacceptable. 

So if you go check it out - maybe lunch is a better option. Happy eating to you !!
