This used to be one of my favorite mexican restaurants in Vegas. And I'm not coming back for a long time. 
My last experience was baaad. Not only the food was less than good, the service was horrible.

The guacamole tasted ok, the ceviche was fishy and too sour. We ordered 2 margaritas and a mojito. One of the margaritas wasn't good so my friend returned it.
The waitress was slow and never around. We asked her for more chips and she just literally dropped the new basket into the old empty one, also, nobody was clearing the table from dirty plates, when the food runner came to drop our entrees he left me holding the dirty plates! He looked at me holding them with no more room on the table to put them down and just walked away! 
At the end of our dinner we asked to talk to a manager, so this woman (manager) comes to our table not being very nice, we told her about everything that happened and she just said, "ok I'll talk to my staff, thank you". Well now you see why I'm probably never coming back. Management sucks! And food is not the same anymore, very disappointed.
