the service was great, the food was'nt all that good...AT ALL!!! 

it was a group of six and our waiter was a really cool guy named carlos, he was very attentive and honestly if the service wasnt good i would be really upset!!! i ordered a meal that included grilled chicken, asparagus and mashed potatoes and it hardley had any flavor at all!!! i also tasted the shrimp cuesadilla that my b.f had and tasted the chicken wings that his brother had and nothing impresed me.
i was pretty disappointed!!! 
so the drinks were good, the servive was awesome (thanks to carlos) but the food sucked which is the whole reason why we go to a restaraunt and pay people to feed us right? so not a happy camper.
