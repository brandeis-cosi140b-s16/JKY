Came here expecting it to be great from the reviews and the picture of the Corn on the cob. Ended up paying $16 for 3 tacos, corn, and a Mexican soda. After spending that much money I expected it to turn out great but meat ended up tasting sweet and funny compared to the meat on the tacos. Friend had the carne Asada fries and picked out all the meat from it. Corn on the cob didn't even look or tasted well at all what a shame
