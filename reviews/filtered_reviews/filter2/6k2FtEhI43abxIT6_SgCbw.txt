Peeps of Yelp - We saw the review of Chino  Bandito on Check Please AZ, and were intrigued. Chinese and Mexican - My two favorite cuisines.  I gotta go to this place - STAT!  I persuaded the spousal unit to join me on the 18 mile trek (36 round trip).

First off - The menu -  You need a tutorial to understand the ordering procedure - confusing and very off putting.

The highly touted black beans were strange tasting.  The carnitas were either not carnitas or like no carnitas I've ever experienced - with shredded  veggies in it?  Really? - very meh.  Pork fried Rice was good.  Egg Foo Yung was good.  

Net - Net:  Been There - Done That.  Going back?  Highly doubtful.
