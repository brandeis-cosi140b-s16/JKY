Let's just say the night started off miserably slow. After waiting five minutes for someone to greet our table and at least take a drink order I finally approached the host stand. The host said he would let our server know. After waiting another five minutes someone finally approached the table. The intro was well I guess I'm your server...after dropping off the drink he didn't leave straws. My chimichanga wasn't even a little crunchy and was drenched in a weird tasting red sauce my friend said his quesadilla tasted like cat pee. Needless to say we won't be back ever again. Sad because I really wanted to like this place. The only plus is the waiter noticed I didn't eat any of my meal and had the manager take it off.
