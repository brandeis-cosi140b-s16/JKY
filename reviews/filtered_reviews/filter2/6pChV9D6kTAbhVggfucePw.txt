This was attached to our hotel (the Monte Carlo) and looks pretty cool from the outside.  However, if you are going to lure people in with drink cards for $3 margaritas, it's my experience that if you want them to stay for more, these should be pretty good even if you are giving them away cheap.  Not the case here.  Probably one of the worst margaritas I've had, it was almost like their sweet and sour mix had gone bad.  Tasted very strange.  The view of the strip from their upstairs deck is cool, and we probably would have stayed for another, had the drinks been decent, but they were not.  Decent service.  There were at least 2 bachelor parties here at the time, also.
