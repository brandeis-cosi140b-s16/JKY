The food here is so-so. We have tried the place a few times, and the Sonoran hot dog and fries are delish. My husband loves menudo and was looking forward to trying theirs, but the first time he ordered a (huge) bowl it was so salty he couldn't eat it. He has tried it since and it was not so salty but only fair compared to other places. 

We felt put off when we were charged recently for a second tiny dish of salsa and an extra 75 cents for onions in an enchilada. Their prices are not especially low, so why are they nickeling and diming their customers? Especially for salsa and onions! We'll stick to Jim's Burros.
