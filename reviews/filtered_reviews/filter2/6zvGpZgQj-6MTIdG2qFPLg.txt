Last week my neighbors and my husband and I enjoyed a few quick beers at Jacks???, then went to have a bite at Yo Rita;s, Service was a little off, thought we were upsetting the waitress? The Taco's were really good, but when all the chips and salsa were gone I really do not think a Taco is quite enough, I know, we all say less food but if we were informed to order a salad or app we sure would of. Just sayin.
