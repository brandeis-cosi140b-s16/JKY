I was so high on this place by all the great reviews, sad to say is that the majority of these people don't know great tasting meat, well, whatever small portion I received. I ordered the al pastor burro and was disappointed, little meat with alot of al pastor sauce, and to much secret sauce. I like the whole concept of mixing spicy with sweet as I got chunks of pineapple in my burro, as stated on the menu. And my michelada also came with a sweet and spicy rim, which i loved. The michelada was delicious but a bit pricy, $18.00 for two. Overall I was disappointed, would I go back? Sure, just for a couple drinks.
