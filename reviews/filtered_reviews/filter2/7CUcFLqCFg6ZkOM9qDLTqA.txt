First off the Service was excellent the food was also pretty tasty but I should have seen this coming what gives you diarrhea most the time Mexican food or Chinese food so maybe a mix of of two would cancel each other out right well I was wrong if your constipated I recommend the food  it will clear you out  it's not just me I grew up going to tj for tacos and San Diego's taco shops and never got sick but this place did me in maybe it's cause I came in late maybe just a bad batch of chicken I don't know I wont be be back though
