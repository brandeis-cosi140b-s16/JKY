Gawwwd... I hate going here. I went today for my Mom's bday but it only reminded me of how this place sucks. 

First off, I will give credit to where credit is deserved. 
There service, bussers, waiters, and so on are excellent. they are fast, friendly and have lots of character. The live music is excellent too. 

Now, for the bad. 

The hostess, are TERRIBLE, three of them told me that my wait would have only been 20 minutes. 45 minutes later I was pissed, don't tell me a ballpark number if it isn't even close. I tried to talk to one to see what the issue was and in the middle of explaining the situation, she cuts me off to talk to someone who just walked in threw the door... These hosts don't do Sh**t. I was there almost an hour and I didn't see one of them sit anyone, all they did was write incoming guests names on a piece of paper and that's it. 

There food is blehhh... I don't think it has flavor...
