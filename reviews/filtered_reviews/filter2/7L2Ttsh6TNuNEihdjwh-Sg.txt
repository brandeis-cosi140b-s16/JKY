I ordered the Michoacan Cobb Salad. It came out with no bacon nor tortilla strips as described on the menu. I asked the waiter for the bacon, apparently he did not understand. He returned 10 minutes later (this is during a work lunch break) with a new salad, this time, without the chorizo and still no bacon. My coworker translated to him in Spanish that I wanted bacon. He then told me after going to the kitchen that the chefs were cooking it. Well, the bacon never came and no explanation either. When it was time for the bill I told one of the drink servers to have the price of my salad reduced by $2.25 (the cheapest cost for sides at the restaurant) because the bacon never came. He did not understand, so my coworker had to translate to this fellow too. The original server then tried to offer me a free dessert which I declined- the whole point of getting a salad was to have a healthy lunch. I asked for the manager. The server tried to give me a free dessert again, so I asked to speak to the manager myself. The manager never came but did reduce the bill by 25%, which was fine with me because I did eat some of the salad and I wasn't trying to get a free meal, but it kind of sucked because of the whole situation I didn't even eat most of it (plus, the salad was not really that good). The rating is based on the salad but the service might as well be the same.
