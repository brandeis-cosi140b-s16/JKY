Ate here on a short business trip to Phoenix.  This restaurant is in a relatively poor part of town, but that doesn't stop them from charging Scottsdale prices. The door opens to a tiny bar, make a left onto the dining area to see the decor is cheap and dated.  All the diners were white, which gives one the feeling that all the Mexicans are somewhere else, eating better food and paying reasonable prices. Guacamole is over $12, it's the same as you can get anywhere else except the put a few pomegranate seeds. It was good.  I had the carne asada tacos which were fine but no different than you can get at any fast casual mexican place.  The service was fast and courteous.  It was unsettling to find barrio cafe at the airport right in my terminal,  and the prices were nearly the same.   The owners of this chain are building their wealth one over priced taco at a time.  Throwing in a few almonds and pomegranates into standard mexican fare and charging 50% more doesn't make you an innovator,  it makes you another greedy restauranteur who doesn't care to reinvest in their business.  No wonder the menus online don't list any prices.  I will not be back.
