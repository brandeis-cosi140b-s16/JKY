I give the place 2 stars total.  

The place gets 5 stars for the atmosphere.  It's a good spot to meet people or take a date.  There is music playing and after awhile it starts to get a little loud.  The place was busy on a Thursday night.  The whole area was busy, gilbert is making their own little busy down town.

The food I give a 1 star.  The taste was ok but for the price it should have been better.  The beef had some fatty stuff.  The chicken and pork was ok.  The waitress bragged about the tacos and that they made the tortillas in house.  The tortillas were soft on the inside and edges were dehydrated.  The horchata was not that great, too much cinnamon. 

The bill for 2 of us was $40 which i thought was over priced.   I will not be going back.
