The vibe of the restaurant was pretty cool, however, our waitress was either new or had something bothering her... she showed almost no emotion, she just seemed sad? 

Aside from that, wifey and I ordered some chicken nachos and a chicken sandwich to split. The nachos are HUGE, but that's pretty much all they had going for them because the chicken was SO dry. I want to say the chicken sandwich was okay, but I think the fries got cold like within two minutes... 

It was their "happy hour", which I believe was a BOGO deal on their $33-ish yard drinks at the bar... I would've bought one to split between wifey and I, but apparently sharing the free drink is frowned upon because they'll try and make you pay $40 for the drink if they catch you doing that. Which I think is BS... if I pay for a drink, it's mine and I can share with whomever I want, just like my food also... 

Needless to say, it really was just "A-OK"and I honestly see no reason to ever come back given that there are so many other solid locations to try...
