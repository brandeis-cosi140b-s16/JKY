Portion sizes are like tapas. Prices are like standard entrees. Tastes are nothing to remember. You're basically paying for flashy street food, but the prices are 3-4x more. I initially went to China Poblano because I heard that the tacos were insanely good. I must have misheard that conversation.

We started off with a pot of Golden Monkey tea, which was pretty good. They hand you a Perfect Tea Timer with your pot, so you can enjoy your brew just how you like it. I was impressed, so far. Then, I ordered some food.

Appetizesr:
-Shu Mai Scallops (6 pcs) - Shu mai was more gooey than the usual plumpness that I expect from shu mai. It wasn't that great, especially for the $12 price.
-Steamed oat noodles:  noodles were a little overcooked. Dipping sauce was average. Regretted ordering after first bite.

Food:
-Pancita al Pastor (pork belly + pineapple tacos) (2 pcs) -  This was ok. Didn't blow my mind or anything. I'll take real $2 street tacos over these $9 tacos any day.
-Viva China Tacos (beef tendon + oyster + scallions) -  a taco recommended by the waiter.  Again, nothing special.
-Rou Jia Mo Street Sandwich - A tasty, juicy pork sandwich. By far the best tasting food on our table. You only get one per order. And, it's tiny.

Overall, the apps were mediocre. The food is puny, bland, and pricey. Ended up spending over $30 a person and we were still hungry.

We stopped ordering food after receiving plate after plate of disappointment. We ended up going to the hidden pizza shop upstairs to make up for this mediocrity. Spent $4 there and enjoyed that meal that made my stomach and wallet happy.
