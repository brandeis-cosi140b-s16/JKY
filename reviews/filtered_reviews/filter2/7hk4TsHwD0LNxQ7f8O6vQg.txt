Can 14 years make a difference in the life of a restaurant?  At Cabo Fish Taco the answer is a resounding NO!

The last time before this week that I had a meal there was 2000.  At the end of my meal I remarked that the fish was overcooked, tasteless and served barely above room temperature.  The service was at best mediocre.

As we were in the area, a friend suggested we go there for lunch.  I hesitated for a moment, but then figured they had to get better after 14 years.  WRONG!  Someone please tell me how/why this place is still in business!

Whatever that corn stuff they bring to the table is was horrible.  None of the condiments at the table could make it much better.

Our waitress (in training) was pleasant enough.  She recommended a daily special - Curried Fish (trout I believe) Taco.  I had actually been in the mood for Indian food that day, so a Curried Fish Taco sounded like just the thing.  WRONG!  The curry flavor was so diluted that it tasted as though someone sprinkled just a dash of cheap curry powder on the fish while cooking.

Jenny's Cabo's Signature Taco (beer battered white fish) was dry, overcooked, and EXTRA crunchy.  I surely would not want my signature on that!

Perhaps I will wait another 14 years to see if they are able to earn that third star....
