Pink Taco certainly went down hill this year.  My friend and I had been dying to return since our fabulous experience back in 2009, but we were sadly disappointed with our stale tortilla chips and wilted Vegetable Tostada Salads.  

The worst part was that we had missed out on a 4* Japanese meal to dine here instead.  Our hopes of reliving the enjoyable Mexican experience were sadly squashed.
