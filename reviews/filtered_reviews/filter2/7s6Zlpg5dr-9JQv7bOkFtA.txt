We came here for lunch with a group from work. Service was subpar, the hostess just walked over to a table and put menus down and walked away; she didn't say anything like "follow me" or "here's your table". 

The overall atmosphere wasn't my favorite. It feels like a cheap bar in Mexico, very focused on alcohol. I don't drink so definitely not my thing. Even worse is that it smelled like urine, not very appetizing. 

The server was ok, but not really friendly. 

Only reason it got two stars instead of one is because the food wasn't bad. 

Won't be coming back.
