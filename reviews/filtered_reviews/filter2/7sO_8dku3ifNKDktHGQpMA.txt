isn't there only one "L" in tequila ?????

i usually make a point of avoiding airport food but astoundingly poor service from US AIRWAYS and we found ourselves stranded at SKY HARBOR long enough we couldn't avoid getting something in our tummies without risking the kids having a feed-me-now meltdown at thirty-eight thousand feet.

walked by the nearly full seating area at BLANCO TACOS and TEQUILA and most of the plates looked enticing enough to give the place a try.

ordered the SHORT RIB QUESADILLA and CHIPS and GUACAMOLE. the quesadilla was pretty much a greasy mess. the short ribs were grossly under seasoned and moist enough that the tortilla required a spoon and pile of napkins to eat and not in a good way.  

the CHIPS were pretty standard like something from the snack aisle at the local mega-mart but the guacamole was actually pretty good.

i was trying to accommodate the kid's appetites and suspect the food would have been better with a different menu choices. i guess if you go to a place called TACOS and TEQUILLA and have neither you gotta assume some of the responsibility for a less than stellar experience ...
