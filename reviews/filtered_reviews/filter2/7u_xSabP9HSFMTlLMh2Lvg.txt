Yuck.  I've been here so many times because my family loves it, but I cringe every time I have to attend a family event here.

Typical overly fried or sauced or cheesed gross generic Mexican food with no flavor or personality.

I've literally tried just about everything on the menu and have been completely underwhelmed.  Now when I have to go there, I just order a plain bean and cheese burrito because it's simple enough to not be flavorless and boring.

The chips and salsa are pretty cool, though I don't care for their red salsa.  The other ones, including the bean and ranch dip, are good though.
