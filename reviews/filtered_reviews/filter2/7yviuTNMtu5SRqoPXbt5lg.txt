HATE  The not-so-helpful first hostess who stated that there was a wait for tables but that I can't put my name down to be next in line for one (when in actuality, I could have with a second hostess).

DISLIKE  Pricing is slightly high for what you're actually getting. Server was aloof. Had to ask for napkins for the table even after entrees were dropped off. They "ran out" of one of their few specialty cocktails. There's a charge for chips and salsa. $14 drink was served in a plastic cup. One of my ribeye tacos had a piece of meat that had not been cut so I almost choked on it.

LIKE  The guacamole with pork rinds. The decor. The upstairs patio view of The Linq.

LOVE  Nothing.
