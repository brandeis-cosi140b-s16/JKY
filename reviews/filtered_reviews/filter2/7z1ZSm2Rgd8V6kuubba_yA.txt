This place is garbage. 2 stars instead of one because I didn't have to pay, the manager took care of it.

We start by asking what their signature drink is. It's a frozen drink that apparently has no alcohol in it for $13.

I figure maybe I can't taste any alcohol because it's frozen. Lets try a margarita. Pure mix. No tequila. We ask the bartender if they wouldn't mind adding some tequila and they did.

Finally, the food comes out. The beans look like they have been sitting 15 minutes. The temperature confirms this. The middle enchilada was still warm because his buddies insulated him. So we had that going for us!

Steer clear. This place has bad reviews for a reason.
