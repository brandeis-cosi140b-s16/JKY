We saw that "Cabo Fish Taco" in Charlotte, NC was on the Food Network so we decided to check it out.

I ordered the Mahi BBQ Taco and it was very good.  Filling delicious flavor.  I really liked the taco shell.  Everything about it was delicious.

My side was the vegetable medley and it looked and tasted old.  It was not steamed recently or if it was it sat for a while.  
 
I also got a the Tavarua Tuna Tacos which I was not happy with.  Dont get me wrong I love me some Tuna.. I love fresh sushi, grilled tuna (salt & pepper), and even tuna fish holds a special place in my heart.  The Tuna from Cabo Fish Taco really tasted off.  I was really disappointed since I though this was going to be the highlight of my dinner.  It was very fishy tasting so much so that I did not finish the Tuna.  

My friend John got the Lemon Grilled Shrimp Tacos and was not happy.  I tried the shrimp and it did not taste fresh.  Very Bland... 

The salsa that is brought to the table was refreshing and had a good amount of corn in it.  We really enjoyed it.  

Overall a decent restaurant but the management may want to taste the seafood without all the sauces on it.  If it doesn't taste fresh all on its own its not going to taste fresh mixed in a taco.
