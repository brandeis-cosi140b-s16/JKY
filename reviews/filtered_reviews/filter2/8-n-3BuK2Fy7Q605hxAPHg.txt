Food is visually pleasing, beyond that I can't say too much good.  The food is extremely bland, no taste what so ever. I have no idea how they get any reviews above 2 stars, I give the taste a 1 star, but the presentation a 4.  The meats taste like they are boiled with no spices at all, the beans and rice are totally blah.  The cheese enchilada and cheese crisp are quite good but again the Hatch chilies are not spicy at all, how does that happen? The chips are cold, they have 3 salsas, the mild is full of corn and horrible , the red is okay and a bit spicy, the green is pretty good and has a bite to it. Just not enough good to make us want to go back .
