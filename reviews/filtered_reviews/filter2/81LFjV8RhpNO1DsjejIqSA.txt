Went for Friday night dinner.   I have been to the one in Old Town Sdale and didn't think that experience was good.  Well, Norte was about the same.   Chips & salsa were fine.  My Cadillac Margarita was okay and had a kick of alcohol but just tasted like a premade mix.   Steak fajitas were a big disappointment.  Beef was way overcooked and was really tough and tasteless.   My friend ordered the chicken chimi and didn't care for his too.   Mariachi band was kind of fun playing in the background.  Service was fine.   Won't be coming back to either Los with so many other good Mexican places in the Valley to choose from.   Honestly, we should have just gone to Chipotle for carry out and made our own margaritas at home.
