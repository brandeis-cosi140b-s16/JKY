I've been here twice now, once during a Yelp event and once on my own. I had two different experiences. During the Yelp event, we were served delicious small plates of different items, and we were able to taste several different margaritas that were all really good. I couldn't wait to come back again, I was talking this place up non stop to my friend, so finally we made here one night for dinner. Wow, what an entirely different experience. 

We stood at the bar while waiting for a table, the female bartender didn't even acknowledge us. We were then seated, at my least favorite area, the pass. So as we watched servers go back and forth with food, not once did anyone acknowledge us again. For a good 10 minutes. Finally we place a cocktail order, I get a Paloma and my friend a margarita. I take one sip of my drink and all I taste is Squirt. Who puts Squirt in a Paloma? I didn't even know they stilll had that soda around. So then we order a couple items. The elote was dry and the queso fundido wasn't as good as the first time I had it. We finished up the chip & salsa because we were starving and couldn't wrangle a server back around to place an entree order. We both left disappointed. 

Michael Morton fail.
