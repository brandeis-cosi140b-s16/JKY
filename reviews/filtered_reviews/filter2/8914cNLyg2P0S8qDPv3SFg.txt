I have actually been to this restaurant a few times, and have yet to write a review, so here goes....

I love the decorations! The place looks really fun and cool, but I think they have some improvements to work on.

I like to start my meal here with a drink.... a blood orange margarita or a prickly pear margarita are both great choices! And of course the downtown margarita is also a classic! The drinks are about the only things I can say are consistently good - that is if you can get one, cause the service here is consistently bad!

To the food.... I have tried the tostada de atun and the beef fajitas, the food is alright, nothing that I could recommend as a must try.

I would love to see this place succeed, I think the decoration and concept are great, but each time I have been here the service has been awfully bad, the wait staff has an overall attitude as though you are a bother to them, and they do not hesitate to say it and show it. As mentioned the food is mediocre, and could use some flavor and flare improvements.  I do have many well wishes for this restaurant as the downtown area is flourishing with many great new and upcoming places and continuing to grow.
