I came back to this restaurant for dinner and I was very disappointed with the food and the service! Per the reviews most people recommended the lobster tacos but truly they weren't that good. The tacos were very small and nothing extraordinary. The drinks were good but a bit overpriced and the service, well the service was terrible. The restaurant had enough staff to take care of everyone but the employees were just talking to each other! The restaurant has a nice decor and great location but i would not recommend it
