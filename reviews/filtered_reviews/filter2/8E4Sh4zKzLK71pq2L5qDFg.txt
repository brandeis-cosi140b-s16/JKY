Good food, shady service. We were there during happy hour and asked if we could get the HH margarita made "skinny" and the waiter said sure. We ordered 2 and when the bill came we were charged $25 for 2 drinks! The waiter said it was an upcharge to make them w/ fresh lime juice and they used organic tequila. He didn't tell us any of that upon ordering, we thought we were getting HH prices. We asked to see the manager and he tooks a few bucks off...really? Maybe they just don't like gringos, IDK.
