Really really really wanted to love this. I came in with high expectations, especially because I am a fan of Jose Andres's style. He is creative and has a vision that is unique in the restaurant world. The kitchen needs to see his same vision. 

The layout of the restaurant is stunning. Two bars upon entry (left and right) and your in direct sight of the dimsum preparation and steamers. There are creative cocktails to choose from, & the bar has an embedded part of the design to hold a spoon...then dissapointment began. 
Without being longwinded,  Salty! Over priced! Really dissapointing! 

This was the order: Viva China* soft beef tendon/ Kumamoto oysters/scallions/ Sichuan peppercorn sauce -- it was one tiny taco, this was my only tasty thing but the price was a serious turn off for the size. Pescado Frito fried fish/ ancho chile pickled onions taco-- again just OKAY, doesn't justify the cost. Beef 6pc beef/lime/ daikon/ watermelon radish --DIMSUM, I've had better. AND the clincher Shrimp Mojo 8 pc shrimp/sweet black garlic/roasted poblano peppers--Salty

I don't know if the kitchen was off that day but I rarely send things back and the salt content was so powerful we just had to say something. We got the dish made fresh again and sad to say, nothing changed.

Our bill was approximately $110 and it left us starved for a second meal that wasn't going to leave us with high blood pressure. I understand that good quality will justify higher priced cuisine but these portion sizes were abnoxious. They should even slightly up the price and give us two tacos instead! Eating with your eyes is the first step to the dining experience and that left us hungry. 

I will definitely continue to visit Jose Andres's other projects but will stay away from China Poblano in the Cosmo when Blue Ribbon sushi satisfies me a lot more in the same price range!!
