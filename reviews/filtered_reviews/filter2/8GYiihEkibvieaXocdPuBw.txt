We went to Barrio Queen yesterday for lunch. The decor is really cool, and I liked the art work and old school barrio feeling. However, the dining experience overall was average. At the price point and with all the hype that Barrio Cafe gets, I was expecting more. We started with the Bloody Mary's - with no garnishes - as the the bartender told us he was out of them at the bar (but never went to the kitchen or asked other waitstaff for more. BTW - we were the only ones at the bar). 

We moved from the bar outside to the patio where we ordered guacamole. It was basically 8 chips and two tablespoons of guac on a tiny salad plate - not sized to share for an appetizer in my opinion. The menu was extensive and taco "sushi-style" menu was cool but pricey. We went instead with the carnitas burrito. It was drier than expected and lacked flavor. It sure doesn't stand up to the carnitas burritos at America's Taco Shop or Gallo Blanco. 

I hope this restaurant improves as it is a nice addition to the Scottsdale waterfront area. But we unfortunately won't be rushing back or recommending it.
