This review is only for the drinks.
Lived in Shadyside for years in grad school and was in town from LA for a grad school reunion/bachelorette party. Stopped in for some drinks in our old stomping ground and we were excited to try a new place with a rooftop. Well, we were having a great night until we came here. Got pitchers of regular margaritas and they were absolutely disgusting. Too tart. Between that and the hot box that the glass roof creates, people were getting overheated and sick. I had to write this bc over a week later I can still remember the taste of the margarita and it makes me sick thinking about it. This place has such potential with the idea and location, but if you are Mexican place and the margarita is not drinkable- you should be ashamed!
