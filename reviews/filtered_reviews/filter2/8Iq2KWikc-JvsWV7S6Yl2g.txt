I remember trying Rosita's a long time ago and being pretty disappointed after a number of my friends had hyped it up pretty heavily...so today, as my co-worker and I debated over which Mexican place to try, I decided to give Rosita's another opportunity to win me over. For starters, the chips and salsa were pretty average. The chips were a little thicker than I prefer, and the salsa (at least in my opinion) tasted like a thin tomato base mixed with water. Very little spice, and not much taste at all. I ordered a shredded beef burro and a chicken taco combo plate because it was one of the best deals on the menu at $7.50, and I enjoyed the shredded beef...perhaps a bit dry, but it still had a decent flavor to it. The chicken, however, gave me flashbacks to my bad experience at Manuel's...although not quite as awful, it was very bland and lacked any real redeeming qualities. I still don't get how a place can f-up chicken! Jeeez. The spanish rice I had on the side was pretty standard, but all in all this was another pretty "bleh" dining experience. My dining companion just sent me an email to inform me that his bean burrito was already trying to make a comeback, I'm just glad I went double rice verus rice and beans. I give it two stars because we had a good waitress who was fairly attentive and because the shredded beef was passable.
