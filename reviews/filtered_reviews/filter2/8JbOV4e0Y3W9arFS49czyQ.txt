So, this place is just all right. My wife liked the atmosphere, but I found it to be a bit too bar-ish for my taste. The dining room is extremely small, so if you don't want to inadvertently eavesdrop on everybody in there you'd better go elsewhere. Also, the bathroom's "outside and around the corner;" kinda inconvenient.

The food's not too bad. The salsa served with the chips is tasty; more savory than most places. Food portions are good, and I was surprised to see my chimichanga overfilled with beef- so it's a reasonable value.

Service is "eh." We were acknowledged and all our needs met, but just kinda felt like they could care less if we were there or not.

Not really sure why "Old Mexico" is in the title of the restaurant, though; like I said, it's a very bar-ish atmosphere playing mostly modern music and serving the general Mexican bill o' fare.

Still looking for the Mexican place that will knock my socks off in the Phoenix area.
