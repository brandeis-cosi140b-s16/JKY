The food was just okay. The taco chips were tasteless and too thick. The menu is very limited and although we were there early on a Saturday night, the waitress came back to tell me my meal was sold out. She should have known that before I ordered. The d√©cor is very pretty, but the acoustics made conversation difficult.
