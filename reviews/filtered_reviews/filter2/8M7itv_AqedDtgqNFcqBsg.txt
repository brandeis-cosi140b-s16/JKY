Buffet line wayyyy too long to even thing about getting into.  (seniors eat for five dollars monday nights)  So we walked to the next restaurant over which was Mi Casa.  The food is worse than chilli's, and its more expensive.  I got a carnitas chimmi, it tasted fine, but way too much salt for my liking (and I really like salt).  

Two stars because it was clean, service was ok, and the iced tea was a step above average.  Probably wont ever eat here again.
