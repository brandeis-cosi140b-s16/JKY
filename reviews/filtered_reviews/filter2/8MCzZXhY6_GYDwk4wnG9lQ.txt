Service was good but the food was blah.  I had stacked enchiladas and my husband had combo plate.  The chicken in both the enchilada and burrito were plentiful but essential tasted the same.  The enchilada had cheese but the burrito was just chicken!  No lettuce, pico, nothing but chicken.  My stacked enchilada was essentially the same too, lots of chicken and cheese.  I think the food is better at Taco Bell were at least you get some garnish.  I have no idea why people are rating this place so highly!
