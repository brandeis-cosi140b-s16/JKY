Macayo's has never been one of my go-to Mexican restaurants. It's always been just OK but not exceptional. My wife swears by the Margaritas and they do have Negra Modelo on draft. But the food is, as I've already said, just OK. They have recently added al pastor tacos to the menu. These are pretty good. I've also tried the carne asada burrito, which is decent.
