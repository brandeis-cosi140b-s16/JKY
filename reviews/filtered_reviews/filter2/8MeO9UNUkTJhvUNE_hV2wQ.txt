I read the reviews on yelp prior to going, yet I could not get over the slow service and marginal food.  We had a party of 16 and it would appear that the staff was just out to lunch for the 3 hour dinner party.  It was Saturday night and it wasn't a full house so I was unsure what the staff was focused on.  I had a bunch of small tacos which were ok, the Salsa was good, just not chunky and hard to enjoy for all because we were not given spoons. The corona was served cold.
