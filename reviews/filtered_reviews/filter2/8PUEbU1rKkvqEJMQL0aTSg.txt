It has been a while since I visited this place but it left a definite impression on me. Now weather it was a good one or bad one, I have not decided yet! This is their second location and boy did it impress. This mega large laboratory as I see it allows the cooks in the back to mix up all kinds of Mexican/chinese combos all for your feasting pleasure. 

My trip to this place resulted from a mini maraton of Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. Being that I am a Arizona native and big man who loves to eat I decided to give this place a shot. After all how many places other than a buffet can you get different types of cuisine all on one plate? Not many.  From the moment I walked in I was greeted and offered a tour of all the different items and ways they could be combined. I swear it felt like I was taking a test LOL. 

(OK you said I can get the spicy chicken made into what now?) I mean honestly if it is necessary for you to spend over 12 minutes explaining how to order food from your restaurant you may want to think about changing a few things around. But after taking the time to study I felt I was ready for my final exam, time to order. 

OK let me say that for those who expect this place to turn out real homemade Mexican food, they will be disappointed. What they do offer is the chance to try things in new and different ways. Are they all a success? No! But with so many choices, an empty belly and a sense of culinary adventure I am sure you will want to try this place at least once in your life time. Who knows you may like a jerk chicken burrito or a jade chicken quesadilla but for me I will stick with the local takeout Chinese food joint. Why because when it comes to food you should not have to choose between simple and good, it should be simply good period. Case closed, class dismissed.
