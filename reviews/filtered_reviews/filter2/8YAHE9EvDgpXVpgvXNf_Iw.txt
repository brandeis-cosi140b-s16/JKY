Honestly- don't waste your time. Way overpriced & even the water tastes bad.  I had a veggie burger- the only thing good about it was the onion I had added on .
Sodas are $3.50. Really? My brother says the nachos are mediocre (Rubio's nachos are better). My mom was non plussed by the enchiladas! Keep on movin past this one!
