Every once in a while yelp is just flat out wrong and that is the case with la santisima taco shop.  Every review makes you think it will be amazing, but the reality is that the food is ok, but there are much better places to eat in Phoenix.  

So what is wrong with this place?  First off, what the heck kind of quesadilla are the making?  I am still not sure.  Why fry a tortilla and throw some cheese in the middle, it just doesn't make any sense to me.  I love quesadillas, but this one was not good.

Second, the "carne asada" was not good.   It just didn't have much flavor.  The only burrito that I liked was the shrimp burrito, although I didn't realize that it had mushrooms in it, which was disappointing. 

The salsa bar is very good.  The tortilla chips are ok.  The location leaves a little bit to be desired and so does the food.  

I am sure many will go to this place based on yelp, but I was not impressed.
