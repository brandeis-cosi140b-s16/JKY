I think this is a very generous 3 stars since I would prefer to give this place 2.5 stars...and rounded up because I think my review may have been biased by my strong jonesin' for a burger...and our server was actually quite excellent.  Besides that, the food receives 1.5 stars.

BUT when you're poolside at Mandalay Bay and you actually want to sit down and eat (not eat on your deck chair...if you're lucky but on the ground if you didn't get a chair), the Border Grill is the closest option.  I was starving, famished...and I couldn't find anything on the menu that looked appealing.  I thought a burrito would be the next best thing to a burger...but no burritos!  Tacos - too small!  Carnitas platter - for some reason - bleh!  So, I got the chilaquiles.  That was probably a bad call - it was essentially a bunch of chips baked into a "casserole" which waslayered with cheese and a little bit of meat.  Really, it just ended up being a big mess of soggy chips and a teeeeny bit of chicken.  I was so sad...  I left feeling full but not the good kind of full - the kind of full that feels gross because you know you just ate a bunch of icky food.  I'd a salad before which was just chicken on top of iceberg lettuce, so I thought something more legitimately "Mexican" might be better...but not so much!
