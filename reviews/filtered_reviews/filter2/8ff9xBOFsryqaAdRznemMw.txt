We had a family dinner here. The service was horrible. The waiter kept letting drinks go dry and would miss when we would reorder cocktails...FAIL!. The food was mediocre at best. Pretty bland. The space felt so temporary. I was just disappointed in this place all around. the only good thing was the chips and salsa came with guacamole and the bean dip was pretty tasty. Downside...a few of the group members got a little ill after eating here. 

The prices were a little high for what you got.
