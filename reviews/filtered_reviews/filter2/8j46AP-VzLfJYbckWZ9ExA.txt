Very average Mexican food catering for people w hypersensitive pallets. Ah! That's right! It's the MGM! That speaks volumes. With all the people milling around one would think they would step it up a notch w the food scene. Au contraire. Ate w a group of people and we all thought the same. Nothing i would run back for but the margaritas were good.
