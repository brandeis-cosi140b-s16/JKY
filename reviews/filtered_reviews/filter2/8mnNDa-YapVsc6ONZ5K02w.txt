Food is decent but WAY overpriced. Two very small street tacos for around $12. For how slow they are, they are surprisingly understaffed. We had to constantly flag someone down for refills or even to place food orders. The best things on the menu are the desserts. Every single one is great. Great atmosphere. It's a super cute restaurant. Just poorly ran and overpriced.
