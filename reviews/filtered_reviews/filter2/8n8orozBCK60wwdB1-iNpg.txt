Based on Yelp we decided to try this place. I can't figure out how this place has 699 reviews and an average of 4.5 stars?? I am not sure what the hype is about!! Simply because Guy Fieri graced this place with his presence; I love him as much as the next person but that doesn't make this place entitled to 4.5 stars. Everyone else who rates it 1 or 2 stars nails it!! The atmosphere is down right disturbing, a twilight zone experience! I kept thinking the entire time "How does this place have 4.5 stars and 699 reviews?" "How?" "I just don't get it?" "Please explain, somebody explain it!!" 
Service: They have the approach of we have an outstanding reputation and you can take it or leave it attitude. 
Food: The salsa bar is unique in that there are a variety of combinations, some strange, peanut, some good, pecan, most have a good kick! But the salsa cups are so small you can barely dip your chip! I got the cheese quesadilla, just not my idea of good, at all! Looked beautiful but too much cheese and I LOVE cheese; cheese is one of my top two favorite foods! That should say a lot! I ordered a side of beans and rice and the beans were really good! That is why I gave two stars for the beans and beans alone!!! 
Atmosphere: The tables are not level, extremely dirty, the chairs are upholstered and covered in stains and filth! I am not hard to please, I'd be up for a good hole in the wall joint, as long as you felt like it was clean and they cared about you being there! But this place is just down right weird! I love the other girl that said this place is schizophrenic! Pure craziness!
