My post might be a bit biased since I spent the entire night and next day in front my of toilet.  Not 100% sure the cause was the food here but aside from that, there was nothing here that would make me come back for.  The food is over priced and not special.

Ordered the al pastor tacos, which were just mediocre and when I had asked the waitress about whether the meat came from that huge vertical roasting stick she had no clue. (dont think it did since the meat was more of pulled pork style)
