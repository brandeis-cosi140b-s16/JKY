This is some kind of joke. Isabel's Amor is the EXACT SAME FOOD as Some Burro's down the road. The only difference is you're going to pay $4 a plate more and have to leave a tip. What we get at Some Burro's for around $22, we paid just over $30 at this place. There is literally no difference in the food. 
The restaurant is small and noisy. Our table and chairs were dirty, but the waitress was nice enough to walk away as I cleaned it and waited until I was done to come back and take out drink orders. Sweet girl. The only reason I gave this place two stars is because I like the food (when I'm in the mood for Mexican fast food). Whoever thinks this is anywhere close to authentic Mexican food had to have grown up between a Taco Bell and Taco Cabana. Go to Some Burro's and save yourself a few bucks.
