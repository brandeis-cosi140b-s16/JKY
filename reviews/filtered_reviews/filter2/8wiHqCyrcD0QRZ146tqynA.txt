I gave this place a thumbs down and it deserves a thumbs down.  I think I would understand better what I was getting if I went back.  We went on a Wednesday night.  The place had some people but not busy.  You order from a line, not waitress service, which is fine.  The girl who took our order was not friendly and even though she could tell it was our first visit, didn't help us in any way (there are lots of ordering options here).  She got two of the 4 orders wrong.  It took over 20 minutes for us to get our food which is ridiculous considering it was nothing more than taking prepared meats and putting them in a tortilla.  They completely lost the order of the guy who ordered in front of me.  The girl who took our order and then left the order station and began running food, all the time chatting on her cellphone.  When we finally got our food, the tortillas were very tough as though they had been sitting out all day.  The fillings (meats) were pretty good.  This place has tons of potential but lacks in leadership and caring about the product they deliver.  It looks like a decent place to sit and drink though.  Nice outdoor seating.
