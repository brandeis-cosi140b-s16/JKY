So we finaly got a chance to try Los Dos Molinos, and I was a bit disappointed. Now the service was fantastic and I did have the single best glass of sangria that i've ever had. It's housed in what used to be Padres, great location around 10th and Camelback. 

I ordered the Carne adobada ribs with beans and rice and my wife got the posole. When I'm thinking ribs, I'm wanting a decent portion of meat on or off the bone. What I got was 2 very small pieces of pork that totaled probably less than one total pork rib, covered in sauce so spicy that you couldn't taste anything else on the plate. The beans were teh same way. They were simmered with the same burn your face off red chili, and pretty tough to get through. the rice was dry and it seemed bland (but I coudlnt' taste very much after eating the red sauce, so who knows). My wife ordered the posole with green chile and it too was too spicy for her to eat. After our mea, we had asked the server about the ability to put the chile on the side and said that was an option for next time..but I can't say there will be a next time. While I'm all for some good spicy food, don't burn my face off and call that tasty. I was really wanting to love this place but the food just fell flat for me.
