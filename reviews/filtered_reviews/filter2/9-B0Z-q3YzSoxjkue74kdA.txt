"Yelp fail!!" - Everyone at my table

Unfortunately, my family's experience at Casa Don Juan was not the greatest.  While the free chips, salsa and bean dip were great (it's kind hard to screw that up), the food we paid for was not very good.

I ordered an a la carte Al Pastor Taco and the Pork and Red Sauce Tamale.  The taco was, truly, the worst taco I've ever had. EVER.  My mother, who also ordered the same taco, spat it out and pushed the plate away.  The flavor and texture of the meat was all off.  Rubbery would be a good adjective -- Tacos El Gordo, this is not.  

My tamale was dry, dry, dry and the advertised "red sauce" was barely noticeable.  There was really no flavor to the pork and, overall, was a really bland dish.  Definitely would not order this again. 

I'm probably going to give the Casa a second chance.  I enjoyed the ambiance and the service was friendly. Maybe I just ordered the wrong things.
