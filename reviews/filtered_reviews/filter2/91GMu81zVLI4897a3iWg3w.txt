My experience was not a pleasent one.
Location - plenty of parking
Atmosphere- a little cramped, but efficient use of space in number of tables. Went early lunch 11:30 no one else there (customers)
Service- took awhile to be attended, only one person. He was busy doing something else. Upon ordering some enchiladas the gentleman proceeds to tell me that there are no tortillas.  I personally was in shock to here this, since it is a mexican restaurant and tortillas are a staple ingridient to the cuisine. After waiting for 15 min to receive my food. The gentleman sais that they found some. And after another 15 min get my food.
Food-it was ok. Nothing great to talk about.
