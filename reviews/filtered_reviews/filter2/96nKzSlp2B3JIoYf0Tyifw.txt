Very stingy on Taco Tuesday. They only offer you three choices of tacos and force you to purchase three at once. The chicken they use is dark and white meat - an obvious sign of throwing the public the scraps left over for taco Tuesday. The chips and salsa were free, but both were so salt laden that only a handful of chips could be ingested. We ended up just having a few drinks and heading elsewhere to dine. The menu is mostly tacos, appetizers and salads. Patio and bar are still heated and this is probably a good place for drinking on Monday and all day sunday happy hour.
