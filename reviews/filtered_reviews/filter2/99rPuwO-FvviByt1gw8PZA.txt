Came here for a taco, quesadilla, and margarita.  The cashier said we're out of margaritas until Monday.  Unfortunately, she didn't think it was that big of a deal.  I decided to leave, based on her response.  Rating is not reflective of the food, because I've eaten at another location and it was good that time.  Unfortunately, I was just very disappointed with the service at this location.
