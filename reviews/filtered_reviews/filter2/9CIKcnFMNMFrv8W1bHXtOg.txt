Rosita's is better than Macayo's (that's not saying much), less commercial and more traditional AZ mex.. It is decent, but they over-cheese everything. Their food tends to be a bit greasy and overpriced, however the salsa is excellent. The menu is humongous and they cater which is nice when you forget it's mexican potluck day at work :) The service has always been fast, friendly and very attentive. 
I'm knocking it down to 2 stars because on last two visits the sewer smell (remember that smell from Long Wong's..) permeated the entire restaurant and I just about lost my appetite (which is not good when you are paying $8.95 for a freaking burrito).
