My friend and I arrived at 7pm and the place was empty.  Our server came almost immediately and took our drink order which was 2 frozen margaritas.  It took about 10 minutes for the drinks to come and they were 85% ice and maybe 10% margarita.  Our dinner was chicken fajitas and carne asada fajitas with rice and beans which were $2 extra.  Forget the rice and beans cause there was no taste to the beans and the rice was the worst rice I have ever had! (Hard, crunchy and no flavor).  The fajitas were ok, lots of chicken, onions and peppers. The carne asada meat was way over cooked and very bland.

I won't go back there and wouldn't recommend it.  The only thing that was good was the service!
