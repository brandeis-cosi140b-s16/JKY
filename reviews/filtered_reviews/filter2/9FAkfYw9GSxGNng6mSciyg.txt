Ambiance is great and bar has a lot of potential.  What needs to be fixed is the level of service with ordering and bringing back food and drinks.  Takes too long for drinks orders and quite often we could not wait for our server and had to go to the bar ourselves (along with several other patrons).

I bet this place would make some serious cash if properly staffed.  The wait times is seriously something that needs to improve.
