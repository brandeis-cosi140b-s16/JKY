Ugh, I wanted to like this place so since I was hankering for Mexican food. It is a nice-looking restaurant with attractive and attentive staff. Our server Courtney was a doll! The chips were good, but I let Darren have the guac to himself since I never liked the stuff. I really didn't know what to get as this fusion, trendy kind of Mexican is not my thing (I prefer traditional Mexican), so I went with the Primavera Tamales, and was underwhelmed. My chocolate rice pudding dessert was lame and had no taste even if the cinnamon chips were pretty good. Darren loved everything he had (he ordered better). Sorry guys.
