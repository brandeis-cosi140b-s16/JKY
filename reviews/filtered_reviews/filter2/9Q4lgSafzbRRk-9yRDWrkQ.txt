We are both Ariba's fans but have always gone to the Camelback location. First time at this location. Food was bland and over done.  Kind of think it sat under a heat lamp for a while. Tortillas were tough and dried out. I do like the bean dip. Probably will stick with the Camelback location. Never had a bad meal there.
