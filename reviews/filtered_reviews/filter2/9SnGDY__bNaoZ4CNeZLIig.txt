Overrated. I was looking for a place with great nachos and saw this shop had high ratings. Cold unmelted cheese, guacamole extra,  all for more than $10 with drink. The salsa bar had containers that only allowed you to take a tablespoon at a time. The beans were good but overall the meal wasn't flavorful. I'm baffled why this place has such high ratings. I noticed there wasn't any Hispanic people in the restaurant,  it looked like a bunch of college kids.
