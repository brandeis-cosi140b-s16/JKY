Oh Barrio. How I wanted to love your food. 1 app, 1 entree, 1 margarita = 55.00. The guac was good niice addition  of the Pom. The halibut veracruz was not seasoned well and the side of seasonal veggies was just half cook thick planks of zucchini. I like to try places Guy Fieri visits this was miss for me.
