Meh.  Service was friendly, and the atmosphere is bright and festive, but it's pretty Americanized Mexican food.  I had a California burro ($9.49), which was a large size, and tasted OK, but for about 1/3 of the price and for about the same size, I can get a better tasting burro with the same type of ingredients at Los Favoritos.  I've also had dishes with their Baja sauce, which tends to be too heavy tasting for me.
