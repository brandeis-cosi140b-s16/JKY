The service is great here. They really do check on you and make sure everything is good. The reason I gave it 2 stars though is because the food taste also has to be good in my opinion. The food was pretty bad. I had a chimichanga and I felt like it was so lemony I had to force every bite down. I never ever write reviews this is my first but the burrito was so bad I had to write one. I felt like throwing up the burrito towards the end. Service is great but the food is terrible.
