This place is SO overrated. Everyone always raves about the authenticity of this restaurant and that its a Phoenix Gem - far from it. I'm okay with the orange vinyl seats and the 70s vibe - no problem, you don't have to be fancy to get my vote. This review is based only on the fact that the food is awful. My chips are always stale. The salsa is from a can and the food is always "okay" and I leave feeling gross and wondering "why did I eat that?" 

I have no idea why this place gets so much credit.
