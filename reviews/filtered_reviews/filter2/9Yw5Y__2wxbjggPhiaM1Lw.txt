The menu is okay but the food is VERY SALTY. I'm not that sensitive to salt but this food was almost inedible. 

The service was very slow and I had to contantly flag down a waitress for more ice tea (remember, I was eating a salt mine!). When it came time to get the check, yep, you guessed it. I had to get up and look for the waitress to ask for my check. 

The atmosphere was casual and decent but the salty food and poor service will keep me from returning.
