I have to echo a previous comment, this place has gotten worse over the past year or so. Friends and I would love coming here for lunch - great food, good service. The past three times I've been here I've been really turned off. We were seated on the patio and waited well over ten minutes to even get a water. Our server constantly ignored us (had to waive him down to get coffee and soda) and we waited well over a half hour for breakfast burritos which came out cold and bland. I'm planning on avoiding this place from now on, which is a shame. This used to be a local spot I really enjoyed
