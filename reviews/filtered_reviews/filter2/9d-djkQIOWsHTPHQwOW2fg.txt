I'm from Vegas, and growing up we used to visit MacAyo ALL of the time. It was amazingly good mexican food. On a trip to Scottsdale over the summer, my mom insisted we give it a whirl. 

I thought it was very basic, quick, chain mexican food. Not horrible, Not great. It was decent, especially considering it's pretty cheap. The manager said the one in Vegas is a lot different than the one in Scottsdale. 

Next time, I will definitely go somewhere else, somewhere more authentic.
