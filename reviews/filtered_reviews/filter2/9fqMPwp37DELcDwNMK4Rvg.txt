I've been here twice now for Happy Hour and both times left feeling very unimpressed. The first time we were there was for Happy hour since we were told that it was $2 wells and half off of some food. Score! right?!...  kind of. I had ordered a blood orange vodka premium drink that was $4 and okay tasting, while my friends got wells. Our waitress appeared to be out of it, rarely checked on us and over charged us on our bill ($4 for wells and premiums? that just doesn't make sense) and when we questioned it, she said she was not sure and asked her manager. The manager i guess had squared away the bill, we paid and went on our way. My friends who bill was wrong ended up having the original pricing charged to her card.

Why we decided to return baffled me but friends were there so we met up again. I think it was the allure of $2 wells and us thinking that maybe by then they had their servers better educated for happy hour service. Plus i was hungry,...Wrong! Our server this time was better, but again when it came to the bill had charged us $4 for wells, and had to talk to the manager, again, who thankfully took care of us. 

Now for the food. I ordered the pork tacos with mango salsa. The tortillas were delicious but i had wished there was a bit more pork on there and more salsa, it just wasn't very much. but for $3 i wasn't really complaining either! I'd probably get it again and ask for more of the mango salsa on the side.
