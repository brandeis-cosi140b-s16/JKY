Went to Guedos for the first time today and was really disappointed.  The food was terribly over priced and all normal sides are ala carte to your entree.  Rice and beans are an expensive add-on and are  served in styrofoam dishes.  You have to pay extra for chips and salsa as well.  I spent $20 for a meal that would have been no more than $11 at a  better quality restaurant.  The burro I had was fairly bland and tasteless, the beans were alright but nothing special and the rice not good at all.  I would have enjoyed taco bell much more at 1/3rd the price.  Glad some like this place.  The owner seems like a nice guy, but Imho, the prices and food quality are a deal breaker.
