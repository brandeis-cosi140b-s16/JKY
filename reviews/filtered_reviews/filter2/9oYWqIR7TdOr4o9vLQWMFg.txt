We sat at the bar and had drinks.  I had red wine and my friend had a frozen machine drink.  It was fine.  Not much Spanish selection as I would expect from the decor  but some decent CA ones.  The theme  reminds me of Javier's.  I usually really like the feel of places like this. The staff was attractive and attentive.  But there was something I couldn't quite put my finger on so I asked and found out it is a chain from Florida.  That corporate was what I was feeling.  All look with no soul.  Understandable for the LINQ but meah for me.
