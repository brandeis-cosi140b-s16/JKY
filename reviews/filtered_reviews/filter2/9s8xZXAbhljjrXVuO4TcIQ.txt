I really had high hopes for this place. I LOVE margaritas, and that hibiscus tequila looked totally bomb... but I never actually got to try anything the last time.

Went in a long time ago with a group of friends for some steak tacos which were pretty good. Didn't have any drinks at the time since it was business friends, but we got great service since my husband's coworker was a regular and very friendly with the waitresses.

I came in alone hoping to catch a friend at the end of her shift, but she'd already left. Whatever, I figure I'll sit and get a drink. It's happy hour, no big. I go to the open seating area. A bunch of waitresses walk by, give me weird looks but no one comes by for 20 minutes.

Finally, waitress comes up and asks me to move to another seat. Okay, I'm cool with that. I move, wait ANOTHER 20 minutes or so. Still no waitress,. Happy hour is almost over.

Again, girl comes up, asks me to move. I do, but ask the girl, Hey, can YOU get me a margarita? I'm dying over here and Happy Hour's almost up. Sure thing, she says. I wait another 15 minutes. No drink. Waitress hasn't sent in the order, she's giggling and flipping her hair at the (admittedly attractive) guy working behind the bar.

I head out. This girl's game is obviously more important than her patron. The hostess looks concerned as I leave. At least SHE was paying attention.

I might stop by there again if I was with a group of my good-looking male buddies, but probably not on my own as a mildly attractive female.
