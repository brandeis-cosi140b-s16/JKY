Our dinner here last night was extremely average. Ordered guacamole, tacos and enchiladas. Nothing wowed. Even a little. The guac had no flavor - seemed to be pur√©ed avocadoes and nothing else. The beans tasted like they came straight from a can. 
The restaurant is beautiful and service was good but this didn't make up for the disappointing food.
