I really wanted to really like this place.  Alas, it's just average.  I ordered the shrimp tacos, fish tacos, kimchee fried rice with shrimp, and nachos.  It was all fair.  The rice had a nice egg on top and tasted reminiscent of kimchee, but the shrimp (for which I paid extra) were non-existent.  Also, it lacked flavor and the rice was flabby.  When I think of Korean food, never does flabby rice darken my thoughts...

The tacos were pretty good, although the tortilla was too thick for my liking.  The nachos were good, but forgettable.  Also the area of town, and specifically the parking lot, are nightmares.  

So I likely won't go back, but OTOH I wouldn't speak ill of the place either if someone suggested going....
