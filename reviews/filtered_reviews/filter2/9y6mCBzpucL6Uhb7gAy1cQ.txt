Ive heard tons of great things about this place. I decided to get the #1 Two Chicken Enchiladas with beans and rice and it was bleeeeeeegh. I got a spoonful of so-so rice, beans that tasted like they had just come from a can and the enchiladas were even worse. 

Normally I dont give places second chances, but the service was good, and the place was very clean. I might try the chorizo or the carne asada next time. Definitely will avoid the enchiladas.
