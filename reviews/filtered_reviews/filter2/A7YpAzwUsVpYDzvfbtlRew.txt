Unlike other reviewers, I found the service to be good which is the reason for two stars.  The food, however, was not good.  The burrito tasted like campbell's chicken soup or probably a lot of corn starch and chicken bouillion mixed with water - really.  I know food and I love food and did not expect high end based on the prices but did expect good taste - did not get it.  The menu needs a lot of work.  People who go to mexican food restaurants REALLY DO want mexican food but it seems this restaurant thinks it needs to cater to an american neighborhood grill with bland taste and NO authentic taste whatsoever.
