First off, the good:
- Atmosphere and decor 
- Maybe the margaritas (from what I've heard)

I hate to be the "Debbie downer" on reviews, but this place is way overrated. The location is its only saving grace. I would've given a 3 star if not for the rude and incompetent staff. Trying to get a water refill could be equated to pulling teeth and ordering 2 tacos resulted in a 30-40 minute wait time. The chicken was chewy and cold and tortillas tasted awful.

I'm all about second chances, so I gave it another go, which resulted in an equally bad experience. The prices are ok, but the service is crap. If you go in buzzed/drunk and only get margaritas at the bar, you might give this place a 5 star rating.
