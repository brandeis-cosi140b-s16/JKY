First time. Not impressive when compared to other "dive" Mexican restaurants that the valley has around. Prices were higher than I would expect for a hole in the wall place. It seems to cater more to the neighborhood regulars than anyone else. The food was average. Not bad, not good, just average. I left feeling not hungry, which was my goal but for $13.00 for a cheese enchilada, beans and small taco I wish I would have tried the Chinese place a few yards to the north.
