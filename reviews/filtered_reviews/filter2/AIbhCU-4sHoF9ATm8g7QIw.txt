This place was okay. My tacos were the best thing I had here. I'm from California so when I eat Mexican food I can be picky. The sauce they used for my enchilada and the actual salsa was this sweet tangy taste that wasn't appealing at all. However,  our waiter was very nice and was on top of everything. So that's a plus.
