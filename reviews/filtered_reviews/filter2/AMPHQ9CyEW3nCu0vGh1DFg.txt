Being from San Diego, I know my Mexican food.  Even the Americanized Mexican food.  While on business, the group decided to order from here.

I ordered a carne asada burrito combo.  First bite and I knew this meal was not going to tantalize my taste buds.  The meat was very bland.  I was expecting a little, maybe even a lot, more seasoning.  Although, the meat was cooked to a medium/medium-well.  There were still pink.  I don't mind that, but I'm sure many don't like seeing pink in their steak.

The burrito was just lacking.  It could definitely use some other ingredients to boost the flavor up a notch or two or three or ten.

As for the black beans on the side, that actually had more flavor than the burrito.

The creamy white rice?  I couldn't even understand how people would think this was good.  It's bland.  The whole "creamy" thing from some heavy cream may make it creamy, but not necessarily tasty.

A healthier option this place is, but lacks flavor.
