Extremely small restaurant. First thing I saw while waiting for a table was the servers scooping tea and salsa out of a dirty cooler. They keep water in plastic containers which I found strange. The salsa was not spicy at all and lacked overall flavor. I ordered a combination and the server failed to tell me that a burrito is the size of my head so getting more than one is unnecessary! Overall I was not impressed at all.
