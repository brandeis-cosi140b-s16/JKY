Terribly acidic margaritas.  Chicken tortilla soup was good but way too high priced for a small cup of soup.  Waitress was nice, but she seemed to lose our order and blamed it on the computers.  Believed her until she came back to ask what kind of meet for one of the dishes even after she wrote it down.  We asked for the margaritas to be free (it was happy hour) and she only brought out 4 for 5 people and didn't even offer to bring out the 5th.   You could probably guess I was the 5th person in our party!  Will not go back.
