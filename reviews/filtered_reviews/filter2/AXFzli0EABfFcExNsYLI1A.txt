The food here was just fine, average American Mexican food. The frozen margaritas also were fine, although they were from a machine.  The service, however, was subpar. Our waitress was so so rude.  She never introduced herself, never said hello, and never smiled.  She came over twice and just basically said "what do you want to order" without any pleasantries at all.  Later she swept by and asked how is your food, very perfunctorily and didn't wait for an answer.  She just acted like we were inconveniencing her.  She grabbed check a minute after she brought it back and was annoyed that it hadn't been signed yet.  Then she began cleaning the bar and turned out the lights out while we - and another table - were still there.
