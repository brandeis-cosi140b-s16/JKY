General public: please stop opening restaurants until your staff is fully trained and your food is killer!!  

I gave two stars because the taco I ordered was pretty good.  Everything else was lacking in flavor, size and presentation.  The only thing full during my visit was my diet coke.  The server brought me three and tried to bring me a fourth when our food was taking FOREVER.  

The computer system crashed during our visit.  The food was overpriced.  Our server was overwhelmed and undertrained.  Will not go back.
