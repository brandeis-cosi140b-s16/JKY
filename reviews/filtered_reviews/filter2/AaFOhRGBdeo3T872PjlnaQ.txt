I read all the great reviews on here and in the 'Phoenix's 23 of the Valleys best new places to chow down' and was excited - both my sister and I love street tacos.
Maybe I missed something, but I have never been more dissappointed in my culinary adventures. The chips were alright...the array of salsas was impressive and all the ones I sampled were quite good. We ordered 5 different tacos a la carte - Cabo Shrimp Taco, Sonoran Carne Asada Taco, Aztec Tinga Taco, Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, La Condesa Shrimp taco. 
The Cabo was tasty, but nothing to write home about, the carne asada was tasteless and overdone, the Aztec Tinga was not bad... but very one note and we were over it after the first bite. The Condesa Shrimp taco had  WAAAY too much garlic and the shrimp had zero flavor - I came across at least 10 full slices and I still have the taste of garlic in my mouth hours later. 
Overall it wasn't horrible - it just wasn't good - definately not 25 dollars worth -  this is not a place I would return to nor would I recommend it to anyone else
