Heard a lot of good things about this place I just had to go try it to believe it. Unfortunately I was disappointed with the food. The service was great. Friendly waitress. Fast service. But the food tastes like any other Americanized Mexican restaurant like "Arribas" or "Makayos" there's really nothing authentic about it. Even Filibertos or Salsitas offer fresher food. I don't encourage anyone to go. I just didn't felt the authenticity of their food. The pricing on the food was good.
