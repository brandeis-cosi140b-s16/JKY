So I have been at both the DT and the North Las Vegas local. 

There are a couple of things that are really good---the chips are awesome, the shrimp wrapped in bacon (leave the sauce off) and the  coffee are fabulous! 

The rest is the same as throwing a Patio dinner in the microwave. Tamales...I hear they are good but I was not taking any chances. The service is also hit or miss. 

If this is the only option...stay home
