Went here to celebrate a birthday a couple days back with family and was pretty disappointed in the food. I would give this place one star but the atmosphere is pretty hip and I appreciate that so I'll add a star but ONLY for that. There were 5 of us and not one of us liked the food unfortunately. The "medium" burger we ordered was rock hard, and the salads were not very flavorful. Another one of us ordered tacos and they were bland and couldn't be finished due to the taste (or lack thereof). The salsas for this place were decent and then I find out after the fact that they charge $6 for chips with the trio of salsas (what?). The server should have mentioned that they charge for chips. The moscow mule I ordered was too sweet (think melted lime-flavored Otter Pop) -- I'll  be back here but only for drinks that come out of a bottle from a manufacturer.. Sorry MM, I really wanted to like you guys and the manager was super-cool (comped a couple of dishes) and friendly but there are too many other places to go around here that have great food and cocktails for the price you're charging! I'm sad because I'm really rooting for City North too! :[
