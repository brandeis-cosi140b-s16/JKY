Sandbar has a lot going for it but a few shortcomings. 

First off, we seated ourselves because the hostess was absent. The waitress did not offer the happy hour specials because we were 5 minutes early.. (bad policy). The waitress then asked me to throw away my brand new coffee because their policy says customers cannot bring their own beverages in.. (terrible policy). 

I ordered a burger and a water. The food took quite a while (around 40 minutes), even though it was very slow. I was fine with that but then the burger was very dry and sort of flat tasting. 

The waitress seemed to be in a sour mood as well, maybe because she sensed my disappointment. This was the first time I have tried Sandbar but I would not return unless all I wanted to do was drink. The place seemed cool for a large drunk get together but that is all. Bad service, bad policies, and so far bad food.
