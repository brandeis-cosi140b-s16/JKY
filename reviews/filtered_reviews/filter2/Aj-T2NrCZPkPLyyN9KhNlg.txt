Reasonably priced menu. I was not very impressed with the food or service on my visit. I have been to some of their other restaurants and like it so I decided to give this place a go. Food was very bland; Guacamole had no seasoning.  Asked for some sort of hot sauce when my tacos arrived but their selection was limited; no "home made" hot sauce.  I will try again later and see if they got any of the issues resolved.
