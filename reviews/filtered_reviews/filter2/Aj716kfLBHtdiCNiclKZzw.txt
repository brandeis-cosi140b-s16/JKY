Bleh...seriously that's all I want to say but I won't.

Food was terrible. Ordered chicken tacos and the chicken tasted FUNNNKKKYY... I don't know what was up with that. Drinks were pretty yummy and I thought this could be dangerous! :)

Came here late Saturday night and they turn the inside into a club (maybe 3 people were in there) and it's all Latin Music BLARING!! Super annoying and the DJ sucked. If they turned it down a little bit, we would be able to talk to each other and I honestly wouldn't have minded the music that much. It doesn't need to be that loud unless your in an actual club.  Probably won't be back.
