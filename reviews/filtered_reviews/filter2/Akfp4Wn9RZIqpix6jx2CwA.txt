2.5 stars

Unfortunately, I was ultimately disappointed.  The service was actually quite excellent, but the food ultimately fell short, considering the price.  

It was interesting to see that in the front of house, there were two kitchens.  A Mexican kitchen and a Chinese kitchen on opposite ends.  I was hoping for more fusion entr√©es, but there were only a few.  The menu was predominantly Mexican or Chinese.  

Setas Tacos: Mushroom tacos.  Nothing special.  It felt it needed some kind of fresh vegetable in there to add some crunch.

Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice: Actually pretty good with an amazing variety of vegetables in it.  Good flavors, season well.  Is it worth paying $16 for fried rice...however good it may be?  Questionable.

The Unruly Monk: Hand-cut noodle soup.  When it came out, it smelled absolutely amazing and then it went downhill from there.  The hand-cut noodles were overcooked and mushy.  The broth lacked flavor.

Beijing Glass: My friend had this one.  It actually had a nice crunch and was refreshing.  I'd call this dish a success.

Guacamole: This was really good guacamole with just a hint of heat.  But $12 for only one cup of guac????  C'mon...that's crazy talk. 

Papas Fritas with XO Sauce: Interesting concept, but WOW...that XO sauce is extremely overpowering and extremely greasy.  I had about 4 fries, but after that, it was too much.

Happy Buddha Giggling Taking a Bath: It seemed like a pretty fun dessert.  How can you not like a jello mold of Buddha sitting in lychee foam??  It was fun to squeeze his cheeks to make his mouth move, but it was pure novelty and not worth the $10. 

All-in-all, it was some hits, but more misses.  Great service kinda made up for it.
