Overall not impressed with this dining experience. We tried a chicken taco, steak burrito (enchilada style) and the chicken tamales. The chicken taco tasted like fast food, and the steak burrito was mediocre. The chicken tamales were the highlight of the meal, absolutely fantastic. To top it off, service was slow and food is over priced for what you get.
