Let's say you have four hungry, noisy, picky eaters... This would NOT be the right place to bring them. Noisy is ok, because the acoustics inside made it hard to hear myself think, so kids who squabble, sing, and push each other out of their chairs (we are still talking hypothetically) don't bug any of the other patrons. But someone, and the waitress assured me it wasn't her, couldn't get the orders straight.  On the first attempt, 5 out of 6 of the meals were so wrong they had to go back. It was like they brought the wrong table's grub. Second try, only two were wrong. They got them all right on the 3rd attempt, and comped everything. I think that if we had ordered as is from the menu without all of our hold-the-cheeses, it would not have been a teary disaster.  The food was pretty good when we got it. On weeknights, they have a free nacho bar from 4-7.
