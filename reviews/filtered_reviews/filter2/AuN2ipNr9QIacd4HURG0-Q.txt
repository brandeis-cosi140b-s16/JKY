So I have been here a few times. I am not crazy about bad reviews but I couldn't even eat my lunch the last time I went. Its always just one thing that is not good BUT that one thing is enough to give me a reason to stick with my Taco Trucks for a while. Sometimes its the soggy chips. Sometimes the salsa tastes like marinara sauce. It's just not my cup of tea. The service is good. The beer specials are good. I just need to break from the disappointment for a bit. I will go it again in a few months I'm sure as it is close to my office. In the meantime I need to brush up on my spanish - no one at the Taco Truck on South Blvd speaks english!
