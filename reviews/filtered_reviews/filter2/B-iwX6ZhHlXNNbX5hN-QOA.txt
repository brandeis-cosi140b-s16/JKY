Food was mediocre.  Margs were decent.  Service was so-so.  Nothing really all that special to Yelp about.  Just another mediocre food experience.  Being surrounded by good friends made the night.  We sat on patio and sweated our asses off.  The misters didn't help but the margs did.  I wanted water but they never re-filled it so I came home really thirsty.  The food looked better than it tasted. I had the tacos and I wanted the shells to be better than the store bought ones but that is all they had.  My husband had the fish tacos-- it was more like a civeche in a soggy corn tortilla.  

Just, you know, not the best you can get that is for sure.
