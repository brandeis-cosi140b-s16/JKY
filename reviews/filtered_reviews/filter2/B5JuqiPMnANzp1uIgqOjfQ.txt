I've been several times to Cantina Laredo.  I'd give the bar 3 stars, the restaurant 2.
Last night was probably the last time I'll attempt the restaurant.

Like others, we were seated outside on the front patio when the side patio had no tables large enough.  The front patio was loud due to outdoor entertainment nearby.  This wouldn't be bad for a loud party, but we were not, so we asked to be moved inside, and were accommodated.

Service was a disappearing act.  Polite, but tense.  Although we each ordered different entrees, 4 of us received exactly the same thing - fajita tacos with beans and rice.  It having taken too long to deal with changing, we stuck with it.  Overpriced, not much food.  

The music inside is loud and disjointed, playing from what seems to be a poorly engineered sound system.  We all found it overbearing.  

SUGGESTIONS:

1.  Put large tables on the side patio where people can talk.  Leave small tables where it's noisy, except for one or two for noisy parties;

2.  Train staff on the menu.  If your menu is in Spanish, they need to be able to comprehend enough of the language to know what people are ordering;

3.  Turn down the music.  We don't want to dance.  Grownups like to talk when they dine out.  Grownups pay the bills.  In case there is confusion, it is on this side of the bread that the butter resides.

4.  Maintain a consistent bar menu.  What happened to the Tanqueray?
