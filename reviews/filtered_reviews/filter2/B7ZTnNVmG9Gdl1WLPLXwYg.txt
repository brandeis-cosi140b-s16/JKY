While recently in Vegas, I decided to go back to and try an old love. No, not a strip club or girlfriend, Macayo's Mexican Restaurant.

And just like trying to resurrect an old flame, it fizzled and was extremely disappointing. Sometimes it's just better to remember the good times and move on.

Like love, our tastes change. Like love, one person matures, the other doesn't move forward. Macayo's is just bland. No spice. No atmosphere. Baby, you've lost that loving feeling.

Friendly service? Oh yeah...enthusiastic server? Oh yeah. But now, this place is better suited for those palates who prefer plain. Period.
