We've been here a bunch but I feel like it's a little bit overpriced and most recently found a big long black hair in the hot sauce. The server apologized and said the manager would come over but he never did.  It's like they could care less about their customers.  I'm sticking with Los Olivos in Old Town Scottsdale for the best ever tacos!
