I started out extremely hopeful because the basket of chips placed on the table were so good that I probably would have been satisfied not ordering an actual entree. As it turned our, I should have listened to my stomach. The basket of chips included blue corn, yellow corn, sweet potato and surprisingly the best of the bunch, fried won ton skins with Navajo spices. The salsa was pretty good though when my friend asked for something spicier, all they did was dump some cayenne pepper into the same salsa and serve it in a different shaped bowl.

We started with the cheap happy hour margarita, which was better than expected to their special Commemorativo margarita, which was served to us in the shaker. For the price, it was a lot of margarita with a lot of tequila and it was tasty. Can't beat that...except maybe with a couple of rounds of Patron.

 I knew I was in trouble, though, when I asked the waiter to recommend a vegetarian dish and he suggested the veggie pasta with black beans and ginger soy sauce. Not sure why I listened to him when every part of my being told me not to order pasta at a Mexican restaurant. But I did. My pasta came with three toothpick thin pieces of asparagus, one mushroom, two pieces of zucchini and a little pile of spinach. There were a few black beans hiding in the noodles which were slightly tinted brown, supposedly the Ginger soy sauce. It was the worst meal I have had in a very longtime and a total disappointment to say the least. I tried a piece of my friend's tuna and it was overbooked, try and bland.

All in all, this place got one star for their margaritas and one star for their chips. I may go back for drinks but will think twice, and probably even three times before I eat there again.
