Terrible, horrible, awful service. The servers were nice enough, but they were so incompetently slow that had I not been with classy people I wanted to impress, I'd have thrown a full-blown fit.

We sat down for a "quick" breakfast three hours before our car to the airport was scheduled to pick us up. The place was dead, and we figured we'd get in and out with time left to throw the last of our self-respect desperately into a slot machine. Heavens, were we horribly wrong. This gorram breakfast took 2.5 hours due to (1) the awful waitresses who kept disappearing for half-hours at a time and (2) the sssuuupppeeerrr ssssllloooowww kitchen. We never, ever got drink refills because the waitresses never bothered to come check on us. We had to ask for our check. We almost ate our arms off waiting for our food. The food, when it did arrive, was ok and it was cheap, so the place won't get one start on those merits.
