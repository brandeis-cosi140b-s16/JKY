Don't expect free chips and salsa at this Mexican restaurant. (I knows it's Mexican/Asian infusion so even free wontons and salsa would have provided some saving grace!) 

Expensive but doesn't deliver! Small portions come with hefty price tag. One small (not even Taco Bell sized) taco is $5.50. Extra $1 for dipping sauces. Expect to pay at least $30 for two drinks and at least $50 for two entrees.  

Waiter was rude; he asked if I actually had a food allergy or was just trying to cut weight. Seriously?
