The experience here was so overwhelmingly sucky that I didn't even want to exhaust myself further by writing a review. Weighing only 110 pounds I'll probably lose 3 writing a review on La Comida, but I love YELP. Being that I wouldn't want anyone else to waste their hard earned money after dining at this establishment, I decided to do the good deed anyway! First of all the ambiance is really nice, I won't knock that at all. I will however dive right on in to say that the service stunk to high heaven. The waitress was combative and had more attitude than the law should allow, and this place couldn't get an order right to save their lives. What's more, they jacked up the billing transactions and overcharged my parties debit cards after we told them 3 times how we wanted the pricing broke down. (Screaming: LORD HAVE MERCY KELLY CLARKSON EDDIE MURPHY!!!) Needless to say, my visit here to celebrate a small bachelorette gathering left me livid by the end of the night. Of course I brought it to the manager's attention, and he in return threw in some extra desserts. Though, I would have preferred to have a much sweeter waitress than under-sweetened flan and tres leches cake. I say don't waste the time or energy on this place.  Just keep walking....and go on to Casa Don Juan, their authentic Mexican Cuisine is the truth baby!
