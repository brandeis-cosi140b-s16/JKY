I have never been to Braddah's before, but I have always heard great things about it.

Being a local boy, growing up in Hawaii, I always loved the cuisine. From Kalua pork cabbage, to Lomi Salmon I am very picky when it comes to the flavors of my food.

For starters, the decor in the restaurant was very Pacific Island-y. The appeal of the restaurant and the atmosphere created a great starting point as we eat with our eyes first.

The service style is exactly like a Chipotle or a Subway. You choose your base, your meats, your veggies, and go. Liked the concept that the restaurant was going for, but I feel as if it was lacking in the *umph* factor. In other words, it lacked the value that makes me want to return to it.

I myself had the steak bowl, and my girlfriend the Kalua pig bowl. The quantity that they put in the bowl was very inconsistent as I had a full bowl, and my girlfriend barely had a thing in hers. It's those little things that really ad up to the value of the food and restaurant.

Overall, I gave it a 2-Star for it's concept, it's ambiance, and the location from UNLV.
