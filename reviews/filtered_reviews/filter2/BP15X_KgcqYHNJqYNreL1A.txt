Expect to pay casino prices for decent Mexican food. Had the fajitas and shrimp burrito.  Lots of shrimp in the burrito is a plus. 

I took away a star because one shouldn't have to pay for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant.  They also charged for a side of pico de gallo. Don't nickel and dime patrons paying $20 for a burrito.
