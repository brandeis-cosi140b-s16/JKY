First, the food was 'homemade' good................

The service, not so much.

Wednesday night, 7PM. Several parties in the waiting area. Bartender and another person saw us and Ignored us. I finally went and asked, and they said a server would be right there. Server comes and tells all of us, seat yourself where ever you want. 

Ordered margarita's and took the waitresses advice. We took our time with the menu as there a lot of choices, and not the normal fare. 

Finally ordered, still no drinks, and then waitress suggests an appetizer to try next time we are there as I told her it was our first time. So we ordered the appetizer, yellow peppers, wrapped in bacon and stuffed with Shrimp!! GOOD!!!!

Margarita's finally came as the bartender had to deliver (apologized for the delay), as the waitress was under age. 

The apps come, no silverware. We had  stopped a bus boy to get water and napkins. Of course we had JUST gotten our drinks.

Then 20-25 minutes later the main course. Again good, but I ordered a burro and got a chimi version which I did not want, but did not want to wait anymore and did not take them up on the offer to redo it..

Again, food was great!! 

Bill comes and not only did they STILL charge for the Chimi instead of the burro I ordered, but we realize they brought us one LARGE Marg, which we did not ask for. So apparently you HAVE to specific to get a normal size.

SO although we enjoyed the unusual and tasty fare (We saw Guacamole made table side and their Chipolte sauce is made there too.) 90 minutes and two mistakes later it just was NOT worth it. At the VERY least she should have NOT charged for the Chimi that was more expensive than what I ordered.
