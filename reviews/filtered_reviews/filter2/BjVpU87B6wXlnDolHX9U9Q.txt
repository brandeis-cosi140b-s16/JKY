I was visiting Phoenix and we came here for my brother's birthday. We had heard great things about the restaurant, so we were really looking forward to trying this place! We had a very unsatisfactory experience to say the least. While the drinks, appetizers, and main course meals were GREAT, the service was awful. Our waiter was spacey and not helpful at all. We even had to ask to speak to the manager because of how bad the service was. The manager apologized and took care of us; however, I don't think I would come back to this restaurant due to the service experience.
