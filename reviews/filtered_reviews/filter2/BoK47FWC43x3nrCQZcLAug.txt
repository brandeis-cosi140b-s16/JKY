Oh, Macayo's you used to be so great.     I have been to Depot Cantina many times and it used to be my favorite place to get dinner and drinks before heading out on Mill Ave. But over the years it has really started to decline. Our server was nice but not very informed or attentive.    I was extremely disappointed in the food. The salsa tasted like someone accidentally dumped a bag of salt in it and my  veggie fajitas only had broccoli, carrots and zucchini. It wouldn't have been so bad if there were saut√©ed onions and bell peppers to go with but nothing about it said "Mexican food."  Food aside, I have to say that the entertainment was really good. It was one guy and a guitar who sang Boys In The Hood by Easy E and Lovesong by Cure (or Adele depending on how old you are).  I am sure that I will be back at least for drinks but I hope that they work on improving the evening service, Depot Cantina is a staple in Tempe and I would hate to see it go any further downhill.
