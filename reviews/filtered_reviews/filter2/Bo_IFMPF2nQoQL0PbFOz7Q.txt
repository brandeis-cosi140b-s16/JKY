Bachelor party decided to eat here on the 2nd day we were in town since the Bachelor felt like noodles and we all flew in so we didn't have a car to drive around. It's pretty much a Chinese Mexican fusion restaurant. But the portions are very very small at Las Vegas prices. It's anywhere between $7-10 for 1-2 pieces of taco if you're lucky enough and all the portions are tapas style...meaning to fill up the average person, you'll need at least 3 dishes.

Their waiting staff is fantastic when it comes to the explanation of how the restaurant works and the dishes as well as being very attentive. In addition, all the tortilla's are made fresh which can be seen in a daily basis. I'd rather eat at Holsteins, at  least I know I can get full off of a burger and  shake...but we go where the bachelor wants to go.
