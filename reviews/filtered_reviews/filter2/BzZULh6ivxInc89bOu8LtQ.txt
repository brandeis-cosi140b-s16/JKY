On the plus side: service was excellent and the chips/salsa, bean dip and guacamole was good. 
On the opportunity for improvement side: The interior is cheesy, and the food was uninspiring. It's almost as if they served warmed over frozen meals. The margarita I had was expensive and smacked of sugary syrup. My chicken tacos were greasy and sort of bland. My husband's chimichanga was nothing special. 
As another reviewer mentioned: there are so many other alternatives for Mexican food in Gilbert, why come here?
