Not impressive at ALL! Cute place, looks cool... Food and service-not so much! They are definitely proud of their mediocre food, judging by the over inflated prices and small portions....VERY small portions for the price.
 Service took forever to come take our order. Actually we were on the verge of leaving when she actually showed up. It was fairly busy, but not that busy! This place probably falls apart when it's really crowded, I imagine. The waitress was cute and nice but really wanted to be elsewhere and it showed. Her infrequent visits just screamed for a measly tip! We accommodated! 
I would not recommend this place...maybe for the drinks?! Just like most places in and around Freemont Street a tourist trap! Welcome to the Freemont Experience!
