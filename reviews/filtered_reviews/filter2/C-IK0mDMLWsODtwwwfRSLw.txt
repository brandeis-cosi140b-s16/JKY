I used to love the queso. I think I can do better with a jar of tostitos cheese. It just isn't worth coming here. The noise level is astronomical,  with all the screaming rugrats on top of the kitchen noise, phone ringing incessantly, and horrendous music. The line is long. The prices are high. There was no cheese in my burrito, yet I had to spend an extra dollar for cheese on top. Plus the extra dollar for the stringy steak. Can't stand any of the salsas or pico...very tomato-y with no other flavors. Chipotle is better, and that says a lot. Oh, and they use the evil evil styrofoam.
