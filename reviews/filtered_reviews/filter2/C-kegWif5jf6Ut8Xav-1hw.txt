This hole in the wall place had an authentic vibe to it. Although, the service was not that great. When I went in and dined in with several other people, it was very busy and loud. I was told usually it is not that busy and you can hear people's footsteps, but this time it was busy. Our service took a very long time. Each time we needed something we needed to yell out for our waiter. And when we saw the manager he said "hold on let me get your waiter". As a manager you should be able to assist guests, it's not just a waiters job, especially when a guest asks you directly for something. We only had one round of drinks and our waiter never even bothered to refill our drinks. I was not fond of the bread on top of the chile relleno, but the carne asada inside was good.
