The only reason I'm giving this place more than one star is because the chips and salsa were appetizing! Downside though is that you have to pay for them unlike most Mexican restaurants that serve them complimentary! The three types of salsas were tasteful but I would've like to have more so I could actually dip my chips in them. 

Enough of the chips and salsa though...on to the service and food. I sat at a table that was part booth part chairs, I sat on the chair side. When the waiter arrived he popped up right by my shoulder that I was afraid to turn and talk to him since he was so close to my face! He was pretty creepy the rest of the meal too not just when ordering. 

I ordered the flautas and my friend got tacos. She said her tacos were mediocre and my flautas were also not anything special. I was however disappointed that when I specifically said no cheese multiple times it of course showed up with cheese on top. I hate being one to return food but due to religious reasons I absolutely could not have cheese and I was specific about it when I returned the food. Not long after they returned with my food and the plate clearly had the cheese scraped off because there were still remnants of cheese on the plate. I was so irked and my friend was waiting for me to eat that I just didn't want to send my plate back again. I sucked it up and ate around the small remnants of cheese. 

I will not be back though! They should be ashamed of themselves for not taking a religious dietary restriction more seriously! I would only go back to enjoy some chips and salsa and some drinks out on the patio even though the service wasn't that great.
