Been going to this establishment for years; since 1987.  Albeit mostly the original location in NW Phoenix, but I have been to this Mesa location 4 times.  This restaurant is going downhill.  Food is getting worse and the portions smaller.  Further, customer service sucks!  Although the prices are reasonable, the food is mediocre at best.  You are better off eating at the food courts of the Mexican oriented grocery markets - at least the foods there are more authentic and tasty.
