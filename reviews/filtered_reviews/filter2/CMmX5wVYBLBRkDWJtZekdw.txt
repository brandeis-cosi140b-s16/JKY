I'm going to review this place and try keep it simple . 

- 30 - 40 minute wait to get there only to wait a bit more since the table wasn't quite ready yet (why send me a text and let me know its ready when its not) and the fact that it was during mid week is mind boggling
- Chips/Salsa came late - in fact I didn't even know we were going to get it so we ordered an appetizer. Some chips were stale as if they mixed it in with fresh ones. Salsa was ok , nothing to rave about though.. 
+ Ordered the Nacho's Chingones for our appetizer and it was good (Yay!) Made up for the stale chips and crappy service so far but wait.....  time to order food!
- I ordered the Pollo in Mole Poblano and the wife got some Tacos (1 of each kind, most expensive tacos every for something so small ) and then we ordered the El Clasico hot dogs "To Go". My meal was not flavorful at all and I didn't enjoy it , I tasted my some of my wife's tacos - again no flavor.  Surely, I would assume there would be some effort into this as this place just opened up, right? WRONG! The El Clasico Hot Dog was given to us when we got our food?  I mean if we say it's "ToGo" wouldn't you make an executive decision to put in the order til we are almost done?? OH that's right... You hardly came to visit to ask us how everything was --- Thanks for the refill on he water though! Appreciate that ... 

In all our experience there was not so good. We are a sucker for customer service and first impressions - it was definitely not even close to par. The food is not even mexican to say the least. Another "wannabe" mexican place with all the hype.  Took home the food and fed the dogs.
