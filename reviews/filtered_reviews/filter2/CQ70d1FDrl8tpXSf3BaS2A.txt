A nice joint with high tables, provided that you like TVs in every direction - I assume a good place to watch sport. Foodwise, it's not very impressive. My pulled pork tacos were not bad, but they were bland. The beer menu is decent, but not very large (so I went for a dogfish). I may be back, perhaps for a drink.
