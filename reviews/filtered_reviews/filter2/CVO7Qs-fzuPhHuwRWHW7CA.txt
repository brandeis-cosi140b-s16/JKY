Ate at the bar. Things were going well until my boyfriend asked the female bartender to change the channel to ESPN. She was having trouble and my boyfriend joked that she was about 400 channels off. She was not amused and when she finally figured it out, her mood changed. She proceeded to tell all her male coworkers of the "incident." I could read her lips. At least do that in the kitchen, not right in front of the customer.

Oh, the food was mediocre. Tacos were bland. Chips, salsa, and guacamole were nothing special. No need to return.
