Well, I would probably give 2 and  a half  stars because the floor manager was great at trying  to take care of me- my waitress was very busy and a table of one was not a big tip. Or could it have been???

I waited 8  minutes and he saw I had no water or chips yet and brought them to me.

I ordered a chicken taco (crispy) and a spinach and mushroom enchilada.

The  tortilla  soup never came.
I was charged for the combo though. When I asked her she explained I needed to order a combo of three items to get the soup- but it doesn't say that.

The crispy taco was great. Delicious shell, moist chicken and good flavor. I really anticipated that spicy ( it was marked as such) enchilada.
 It was... Sweet! They added their corn in the enchilada. The corn is sweet.
Ugh... A sweet enchilada. I asked to replace it with a regular cheese enchilada- which I took s photo of,
It was good.  Chain restaurant good. 

I wish we had those hole in the wall authentic restaurants here in the Foothills. 

The menu looked good- lots of choices. And they have a home made tortilla station.
That's cool- but I didn't try them.
Can't decide if I'll give this another shot or not. Depends on how desperate for Mexican food I get!
