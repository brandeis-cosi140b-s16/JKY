Wow, after hearing so much we went for lunch and left disappointed.  I always ding if I don't get asked two questions:  "How is your food?" (shortly after it's served) and "how was everything?"  I didn't get either of these questions and were done with our meals before the server came by to clear the plates.  The rice was horribly undercooked and the carnita's were tough.  My masa tamales were decent.  The salsas served with the chips were decent but as a whole I've eaten at a lot better mexican joints than this.
