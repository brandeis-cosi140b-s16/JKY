My friends, who live in Arizona, brought me here promising me a great dining experience with fantastic authentic Mexican food. Being from Alaska, I don't get the chance for authentic Mexican food very often. I was severely disappointed.

The service was horrible. We waited too long to get a table, too long to get our order taken, and way too long for boxes for our food. The staff was friendly, just incredibly slow. Granted, the restaurant was full.

The food, however, was also a letdown. I've had better Mexican food in Alaska. Won't be going here again.
