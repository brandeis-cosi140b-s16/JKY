Tee Pee was recommended to me by a friend as the best Mexican food in town.  My boyfriend and I went there on a Sunday night and were very disappointed.

The restaurant was noisy and crowded.  The salsa was spicy, but lacked flavor beyond the heat.  

The guacamole was generally flavorless and had the consistency of baby food.  There were, occasionally, big chunks of avocado, which were nice but they seemed out of place in the puree.  The chips were fresh but, again, had no real taste.

I had chicken tacos, my 'baseline' meal for new Mexican restaurants.  My boyfriend had enchiladas.  Again... everything was simply so-so.  My taco shells seemed slightly stale and tasted like what I would get out of a taco kit from the store.  The chicken was tough.  My boyfriend was similarly underwhelmed by his meal.

The rice, however, was tasty.  I'll give them that much.

Overall, we will not be back.  There are too many excellent Mexican restaurants in the area to revisit mediocre ones.
