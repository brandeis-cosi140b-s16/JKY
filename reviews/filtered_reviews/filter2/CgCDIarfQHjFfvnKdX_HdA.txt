This is the third time I've visited this restaurant for lunch and this is the first time I've been disappointed. Your new menu is fine, but now you have to pay extra to experience the chips and salsa. The waitress will bring you a flavorless version salsa that resembles ketchup with spices, but it doesn't compare to the pineapple salsa, or verde salsa you now have to pay for. This is not good customer service. Having to pay extra for your good salsa seems cheap. Just take it off the menu if you're not going to allow people to try it. 

As for the food: Burritos are tasty, Relleno is okay, the beef, shrimp and pork tacos are yummy. I tried the Baja taco today ... Icky! It resembled battered frozen fish from  a grocery store. It's far from Baja! 

The service has been good and the beer is cold, chips are crunchy and hot, but again, don't get your hopes up on the salsa. If you want good, free salsa, go to Blue Adobe Grill on Frank Lloyd Wright. It's delicious and complimentary.
