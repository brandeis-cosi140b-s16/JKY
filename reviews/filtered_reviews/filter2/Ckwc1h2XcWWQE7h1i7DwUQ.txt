I don't get the great reviews. While not bad, I wouldn't go out of my way to go here again . The chips are cold, salsa is blah to the max. The food is very pretty but lacking flavor except for the cheese crisp which is very tasty.  If you do go and have a choice between the red or green sauce, go red , the red has some good flavor to it, the green again is very blah
