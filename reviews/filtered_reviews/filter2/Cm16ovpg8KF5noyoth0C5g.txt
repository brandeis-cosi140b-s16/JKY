pro: chix nachos good taste and a good price. guacamole fresh with good flavor.

cons: staff inefficient, sloppy looking
slow to bus tables, dirty dishes etc sitting on tables
busser threw rag he used to clean tables over his shoulder. didn't wash hands after cleaning table, then touched all the new silverware, as he went from table to table

wont be going back
