Come here expecting a bar with bar food, and you will not be disappointed. Don't come here and expect legit Mexican food. The queso tastes like what you'd buy at the store, and the chips were stale. The. Chips. Were. Stale. That's almost hard to do. The only reason I'm even giving two stars is because the outdoor area is cool, and they allow dogs.
