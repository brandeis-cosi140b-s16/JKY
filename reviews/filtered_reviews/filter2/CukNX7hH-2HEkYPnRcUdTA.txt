Not impressed! My chicken fajita was mediocre. I was expecting my chicken fajita to arrive sizzling but it arrived cold and overcooked. The food must of been sitting on the counter too long waiting to be picked up. The runner was careless and still delivered my food knowing that it was cold. Our waiter finally arrived and placed a new order. I don't plan on returning for an overpriced chicken fajita and poor service.
