I went there with my fiancee and we went in as hungry patrons and came out satisfied.  The odor when you go in is not pleasing and the set up feels odd.  The first round of chips were complimentary and the salsa was hot but good.  We ordered sodas and found out that only one extra refill is free which is not good when you're eating some spicy salsa.  

The food was okay, not great.  We had a chicken chimichanga, flautas, and Spanish rice.  The chimi was hot and really crispy and the guac and sour cream on the side were good. The Spanish rice was very light and fluffy.  The fiancee wasn't overly impressed with the flautas and that is coming from a flauta/taquito expert.  

The bathrooms were about on par with all the bathrooms I've used on Mill Ave, which means you don't want to spend much time in there.  

All in all, if you really want Mexican on Mill and you want more than Del Mar burritos or quasi-Mexican Z Tejas, hit it up, but I'd rather walk an extra few blocks and go to Macayo's Depot Cantina.
