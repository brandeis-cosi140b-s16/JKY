I apologize to my fellow Yelper's but this place has unfortunately really gotten cheap. The nachos are a good size but the chips tasted like they were fried in old oil.  

The tostada is not even close to what a tostada should be.  They don't have refried beans, really?  What happened to the authenticity?

 The burrito is a good size but the chicken was dry and they guy forgot about it once he put in on the oven press.  He gave me the nachos and walked away.  I stood there & when he came back he looked at me and asked me what else I needed?  I looked at him, I pointed to the oven press and said my burrito?  Needless to say it came out burnt.  

The dining room had a lot of empty tables all dirty and the entire place just felt less then impressive.

I ordered a house margarita with salt, not only was it in a very small glass which I have never seen here before, there was no salt on the rim and to charge $9 for that is way more then it was worth.

This is not the first bad experience I have had here but I can say it will probably be my last as this is an experience we did not enjoy.
