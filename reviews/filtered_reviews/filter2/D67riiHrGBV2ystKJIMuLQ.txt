As a new Arizona resident and a Chef of 30 years from Seattle WA in search of new favorite places to dine. I often trust in the Yelp reviews. This place had good reviews so we tried it out. First off the layout of the place was not conducive to the customer. A lot of the customers seemed to be regulars and loved the place. We both had the shredded beef tacos which were mediocre at best but our rice was stone cold! It was alright but we won't be going back. May I suggest you all try Backyard Taco in Mesa.
