Wifey and I dined here in Nov., 2008, and we found this joint to be very overpriced and very average. The place was dead on a weeknight, a bad sign. The room looked like it could hold 300 people, and there were only about 7 of us total. Service was good, but chips and salsa was mediocre, food (nachos and enchiladas) was average, even below average. We found it to be more expensive than other, similar Mexican restaurants in the area. I would not go here again.
