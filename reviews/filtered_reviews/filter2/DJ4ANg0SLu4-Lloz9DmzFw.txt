I decided to give this place a try because I was hungry and it was right across the street from where I was shopping. Even though I should have know better by now that most of "authentic" Mexican food in Charlotte has not been good or authentic. I ordered the enchiladas Tejanos because the description sounded good. However, the best part of the meal were the beans. The "oaxaca' cheese tasted nothing like real oaxaca but reminded me of gooey monterrey jack. I have never tasted barbacoa that is these sweet. In my opinion, Chipotle's barbacoa is more authentic. I just can not like the flavors that I've found in the so called Mexican food joints around here. I will stick to the few hole-in-the-wall spots for my Mexican food.
