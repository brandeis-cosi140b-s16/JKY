Lunch for 2 costs $36 here not including tip.  

The place is corporate mexican restaurant...

- The servers were okay but you can tell they hate their job.
- The table was all gummed and sticky.
- The place is "stale" - hard to explain - but that is the best description I can come up with.
- I had 2 chicken enchiladas.  Meh..  Rice and beans. meh...  I would say this is below average mexican food.

I would skip this place.  No Bueno.
