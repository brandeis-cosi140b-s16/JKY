I enjoyed the stylish atmosphere, however the food was okay.

The music and decor created an upbeat, enjoyable atmosphere. Although seating is limited in the dining room, they do offer seats at the bar(s). They have two sets of bars. 

The menu is broken into two different sections: Chinese and Mexican. I chose two Chinese items. 

The lamb pot stickers were okay. The pot stickers presentation was nice. All four of the pot stickers were elegantly made together to appear like a pizza with four perforations that made separation from each other much easier. They had an odd smell and no real flavor. The pot stickers were simple there to eat. Would I order them again? No. 

The second item I ordered was the Ocean's Nest. It had a wonderful medley of vegetables and seafood nestled on top of the crispy, fried noodles. Although I expected soft noodles for the dish, the crispy noodles become soft as the lightly sauced dish saturated some of the noodles. I wasn't a big fan of the crispness of the noodles particularly when trying to cut the noodles so it was easier for me to eat. I thought the dish wasn't bad. I would have been happier with soft noodles, but the vegetables and seafood were tasty. Would I order the item again? Probably not.

I did think the menu prices were quite reasonable for what I ordered. Overall, the atmosphere makes for nice conversation, but better food can be found elsewhere.
