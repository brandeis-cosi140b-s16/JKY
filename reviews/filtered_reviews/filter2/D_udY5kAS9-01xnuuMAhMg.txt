The only good things about La Comida were our amazing server and the cozy atmosphere. 

La Comida is the quintessential tourist trap that's ironically located in a not-so-touristy, local hot spot area of downtown Vegas.

I had been dying to try this place, even after reading all of the crappy reviews, because I'm optimistic and I'm not overly critical of new restaurants. I know what it's like to be on the other side, have an "off" day, etc. 

I don't want to get into all of the things that are wrong with La Comida because other Yelpers have done a good job of summing it up. My experience can be pinned down to the same experience everyone else seems to have - extremely small servings, high prices, watered down drinks and lack of flavor.

I love Mexican food. LOVE. And it's really hard to disappoint me. I've had great meals and average meals at so many different Mexican restaurants in Vegas.  So, I am not expecting 5 star quality food or the best meal of my life.  But, I am expecting decent flavor - especially if I'm paying $15 for two tiny tacos and the smallest plate of rice and beans brought to a table of 4 to SHARE. 

La Comida has a lot of potential - if management would pay attention to the reviews and make some changes in the kitchen -  I think it could be very successful.
