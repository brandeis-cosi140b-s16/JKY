Pretty surprised by how many good reviews this place has. First of all no one really mentioned it is sort of attached to the strip club sapphire so getting there/parking was a bit confusing. As for the food, I wasn't really impressed by anything. The carne asada tacos tasted pretty dry so I didn't finish them,  the queso dip was ok but not as flavorful as I would've thought for the way it looks, the carnitas tacos were ok but boring in terms of flavor. Maybe if I would have added a lot of toppings to each taco it would've been better but I shouldn't really have to. The best tacos for me were the cochinita because of the pickled habanero/onions on top adding to it's flavor and texture. The salsas were also good.
But overall pretty disappointed.
