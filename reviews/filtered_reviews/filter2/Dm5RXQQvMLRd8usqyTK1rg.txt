Bullet point summary:

- Prices are not terribly expensive for airport food
- Don't expect great service. Remember, it's airport fast food
- Chicken based burritos are awful here. 
- Tofu veggie burrito and shrimp burrito are better, get those
- Small. Chipotle has spoiled us all. This is a "normal" sized burrito which is about 70% of the size of a Chipotle one
- Pre ready and packed salsas are nice to grab quickly. But, there is a catch: they all are terrible. 

Remember also that this airport has so few decent food options that relative to others, so I cannot say "avoid, go elsewhere" since the going elsewhere is actually pretty hard to do.

Overall, not terrible, not good, so 2 stars.
