The food at Carlito's is OK.  I can't think of anything better to say about it.  

The green chile is New Mexico chile, cooked a little untraditionally, but close enough to the real thing, that someone who has lived in New Mexico finds it somewhat familiar, but lacking the gustatory punch of really well-prepared New Mexican green chile.

The flour tortillas are of poor quality and have a tendency to fall apart.  The refried beans are so bland they border on baby food.  And the atmosphere, well, it's like a taqueria: noisy, cheap, crowded.

It's good for someone looking for a green chile fix, but probably not the place to eat for really good New Mexican food
