Not very impressed. I've been to the Valle Luna in the West Valley several times and thought it was good, so I finally went to the East Valley location. When I am rating a Mexican food restaurant always base it on chips, tacos, and enchiladas. First, the chips tasted over done. Second, the tacos were fairly tasteless and fell apart because the shell was drenched. Third, the enchiladas has black olives. I'm an Arizona native and have had Mexican food a couple of times and I don't recall of many places putting olives in their enchiladas. 

In the end I may go back, but it won't be for a while.
