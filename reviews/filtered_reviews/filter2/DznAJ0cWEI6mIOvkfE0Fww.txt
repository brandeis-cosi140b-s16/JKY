I used to come here often...both with the kids for food and also with the guys for drinks at the bar.  Tough to beat $2 Pacificos all night long.  

We visited last Friday night for dinner at around 7pm and the restaurant was empty.  I believe there was one other table of diners and about 7-8 rowdy drinkers at the bar.  One of the reasons we stopped coming to the bar was they attract a rough crowd.  Tattoos, smoking pot in the parking lot... Not passing judgment... Just not my scene.  

So tonight we order and sit at our table.  They had one guy working the cashier.  A young guy with black spiky hair.  The same guy was also delivering food to the tables.  Even though the restaurant was empty, he provided such poor service we'll never return to a Vegas Wahoos again.  We'll just wait until we go to Huntington Beach where they do it right.  

When he delivered the first portion of our food, I asked him for the green sauce.  He gave me a look as if I was being a pain, but he returned with the sauce.  When he returned with the rest of our order, my son asked for a knife.  He literally rolled his eyes and went straight to the bathroom.  

Now I know it's annoying when guests asked for things...especially when they don't ask for them at the same time, but our whole table was shocked at his response.  We looked at each other and waited to see whether he was going to come back.  Finally my 12 year old son got up and went behind the kitchen area to get his own knife!!!   Hahaha.  Unbelievable.

When the guy returned from the bathroom, I figured he would deliver the knife.   Nope...he stood in front of the TV and watched sports!!!  Check out the photo!!!  

The founder of Wahoo's was here at the grand opening.  He should reconsider his choice for area developer.  They know nothing about customer service.
