I would round up to 2.5, but "A-OK" is a bit too strong.

Here's the deal: it's a place to grab food and/or drinks while waiting for your flight.  There's no way the food is going to be great, the ambience will be amazing, or the service to be stellar.  I'd be a bit happier if the tables were slightly more clean, but hey, maybe I'm asking for too much.  

What I did appreciate is that there actually was some flavor in the food.  Jim G. and I shared the Eggs with Queso Fresco and, while the amount of said queso left me wondering why it was part of the name of the dish, the flavor of the jalapenos and the spicy tomato salsa on top surprised me.  There was plenty of food there, as they give you a ton of these lukewarm potatoes and a tortilla.  

Our server was nice, but too busy and therefore not all that attentive.  Food took a bit longer than I'd like (especially at an airport) and it took a bit too long to get our check.  

It's in the airport; I don't expect a ton. You shouldn't either.
