The hostesses are not good... They are teenage girls that don't even know where open tables are or if they have any. When asking a question about the out door seating one who was dressed very inappropriately chimed in with a snide remark. The wait staff is hit and miss. Sometimes you get a good one some times you don't. The atmosphere is good, nice television set up for watching sports. The music is good, but even during the day don't expect to have a conversation over it. The food is pretty good. I would highly recommend the nachos. This seems to be a prime example of an establishment that can't descide if it wants to be a restaurant or a night club.
