This was my 3rd time here and very disappointed!! They had NO salsa bar, no one ordering food but it took about 10 min to have some one come and ask what i wanted. The counters were dirty like they caught something on fire and the ambers blew on to them. Ordered 3 Carne Asada Tacos and a Carne Asada burrito. Also chips and guacamole. It was $4.15 for chips and guacamole and it wasn't worth it. The chips were hard, stale and the guacamole was flavorless. The Carne Asada tasted like it wAs cooked with fish! Awful!! I was in love with the Carne Asada but now i have to rethink it. Customer service was not great all they cared about is sitting watching tv or talking about what there plans were in Spanish. Not satisfied!!
