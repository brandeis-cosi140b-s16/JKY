Atmosphere =F
Wait Staff and Greeter Girl=D
Bus boy/chip boy=A+

I went to dinner with  my kids tonight and the girl who sat us couldn't even smile just a little...she almost seemed annoyed that we walked in the front door.  We were seated and weren't acknowledged for a good 6 o 7 minutes.  The bus boy saw this and immediately brought chips...still no waiter.  After my son tried the hot salsa he was gasping and turning red dying for some water that the bus boy came over and took our drink order and gave us a menu
The waiter came over 2 seconds after that and asked if we were ready to order...we only had the menu for 2 to 3 seconds so no we weren't ready to order.  He said he come back....we waited for him to come back for over 10 minutes.  By the way, there was only 5 other tables being sat at...the restaurant was empty.  Our waiter NEVER smiled...seemed grumpy that he was working.  

Did I tell you the bus boy/chip boy was great!!!  If it wasn't for him I would have left 1 star!  The food was just OK.  My sons got chicken tenders and fries and it tasted like the fryer hadn't been cleaned in weeks...UGH...soggy flat fries and the tenders turned a dark brown color from dirty fryer oil.

Needless to say I won't be coming back.  Hope the owner looks at these reviews and does something positive....the restaurant needs some spunk/life to it.  Just very drab and plain like the wait staff!
