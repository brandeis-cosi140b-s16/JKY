I am probably wasting my time with this review, seeing as there are well over 100 reviews.
But, I have to because I really wonder why all the hype.
Yeah, the food is really good. But, the portions are small and really, really pricey. You get half as much as you would expect at twice the price.
Not to mention they tout the chef and menu being inspired by her childhood in southern Mexico. So when I ordered my entree and the waitress asked me would I like fries or salad with it, needless to say I was more than a bit surprised. What? Did she grow up in Mexico having fries with her tacos? 
The place is tiny and incredibly noisy. You don't have a conversation there, you have a shouting match. And it is full of forty and fifty-something urban and hip upper middle class. (Although, is there a middle class anymore?) Not that there is anything wrong with that, I think it just speaks to the the food, prices and atmosphere.There is barely enough room to navigate and the near misses between the staff and the customers are something to see.
Again, the place is not bad. I would probably like it a lot more if it were a lot less expensive. But, I think the Barrio Cafe is more hype than anything else and I don't think they deliver.
