Weak Mexican food. Along the lines of Chevy's. I may be a bit biased when it comes to mexican food having grown up in SoCal, went to school in SD and now have access to the Mission in SF. 


I didn't necessarily need/expect a great meal here, but this stuff was just flat out bad. I was STARVING when when I got there, ordered fish tacos and couldn't even finish them...not because I was full, they were just that bad.

The service was decent and the ambience is about what you would expect with a name like "Loco Patron". 

Go here for beers/shots only.
