I feel like everyone goes nuts for this place. But I don't really see why. It's over-priced mediocre food that you can get at a more charming mom & pop business that's less expensive and with better quality. 

The Good:
-fried ice cream
-giant sombrero that they make you wear while they sing the happy birthday song
-the shot of tequila that they slam on the table after they sing to you (better drink that sucker fast!)
-the soup that you get at the beginning of each meal (which is a little bit of a stretch putting it in the 'good' category since I think it's a little too salty)

The Bad:
-over hyped salty food
-prices
