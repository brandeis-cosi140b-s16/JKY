Went there for lunch today with my wife since we saw a good review in the paper.  We were kind of disappointed.  I had the menudo--while a big bowl, it was not very flavorful.  And we also ordered three of the standard (small) tacos - fish, canitas, and carne asada.  Fish was very skimpy and not good.  The carnitas and carne asada tacos were also poor -- meat chopped into itsy-bitsy pieces and overcooked.  It was like eating bits of dried and flavorless cardboard.  We prefer the meals at the place on the Southern and Mesa Drive -- a Mexican bakery that also has good food.
