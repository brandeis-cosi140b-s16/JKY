I'll admit I was glad to have Guinness with my meal, but how weird is it to have an Irish bar serving Mexican food?  Answer:  very!   And, unfortunately, they don't pull it off.  The decor is a little odd with the discordant theme, but it was comfortable enough inside.

The most important characteristic of any restaurant is the food, and the food here is average to poor.  Maybe I'm biased coming from Tejas, but I expect more than clammy refried beans and bland shredded lettuce with almost flavorless cheese.  Chips and salsa were OK but the meal went downhill from there.  Really, I could have done better at one of those lifeless Rodiberto/Edilberto/Filiberto kind of joints.  It seemed very similar in taste and quality.

I wanted to like this place because I am a Mexican food junkie.  But....
