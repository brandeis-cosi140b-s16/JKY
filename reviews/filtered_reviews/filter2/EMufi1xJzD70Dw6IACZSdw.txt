Just went here today. Used to be one of my usual lunch spots and they will get an opportunity to redeem themselves, however, today was ridiculous. They gave me someone else's burrito and charged me twice for it. The little chick in the red shirt seemed like she was high or something and totally messed up at least 4 people's orders because she lost track of who ordered what. 

Saddest part, this was at 11:00 am... They were not busy and I was starving. I ate my wrong, burnt burrito because I was starving. I am sorely disappointed in this trip. I've come to expect much better from you, Caf√© Rio!
