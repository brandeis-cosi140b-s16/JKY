Not impressed with this place.  The view was gorgeous but I've had better fajitas at chili's!  The busser was on top of it, but the waiter was a little weird.  The horchata was about the only thing that I can say was really good, which is sad because I've heard so many good things about this place.  We probably won't be going back, if it wasn't for the ambiance.
