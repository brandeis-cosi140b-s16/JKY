We've been going to this rest. Since opening, but yesterday had the first bad meal & worst service. Had avocado dip done at table-it had so much lime juice in it that's all you tasted. The waiter acted like he had a real problem-three times we asked for the table side guacamole. I also bought dinner (take out) for my husband. The only person who got the order right was the side waiter or bus boy. Had ordered two chili reanios $ three flans. The waiter brought 1 flan-thank heaven we checked the bag. We've always had excellent service, the food has come out perfect, hot & in a timely manor. But that was lacking yesterday. My friend even commented that the waiter acted like he was on something. Sorry to have to write this, but hope we don't have this kind of experience again. Thank you. Patricia Haggerty
