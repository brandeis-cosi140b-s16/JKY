This is basically only for the elote aka Mexican corn on the cob.

After beer fest we came to container park, to sober up basically, haha. I saw some lady with an elote so I came here, and waited almost 20mins in the line.

The price is 3.95, which to me is a little steep. The corn itself seems steamed, and I'm used to the grilled or boiled. It was prepared with your traditional fixings.. I think... mayo, cheese, and chile. To me the taste was super bland and for the price it was not worth it at all. 

It may be because I'm used to the legit eloteros, they slather it with high cholesterol! I mean, butter, mayo, queso, and some tajin. This place fell hella short... the 2 stars is again based off the corn.

Customer service is just ok, the guy gave me crap about the part of Mexico I'm from and I wanted to show him what we do to people who run their lip in my area :)

I may come back to try their other offerings... or I can just go to my kitchen and make it myself, but it will actually be delicious.
