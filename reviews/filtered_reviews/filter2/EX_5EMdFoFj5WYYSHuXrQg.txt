This place gets two stars because the interior decor is gorgeous (for the most part) and the chips are nommy.  The waitstaff is good about filling beverages and chips. That's it.  You are paying for the decor and construction costs, and not getting quality or tasty food in return. 

I ate here last week for lunch, after being told there was a two hour wait on opening day (despite the restaurant not being full).  I was seated immediately this time, after the hostess rudely remarking that she remembered me from the previous week.  I was brought to a table near the base of the stairs... So far so good.  Although the water in the fountain was green and cloudy.

I ordered a chicken chimi and iced tea. This was around 2:30 pm and it still took about 45 minutes for my food to come out.  By that time I'd eaten way too many chips (yeah they're good although the salsa is just meh) and wasn't very hungry.  Which is good because my chimi was the smallest burrito I've ever seen.  It was dry and lacking in flavor and I left half of it and the beans and rice (also meh) on my plate.  Definitely not impressed.

I've had better food for a fifth of the price at Roberto's Taco Shop, and that's saying something, since I think Roberto's is also crap!
