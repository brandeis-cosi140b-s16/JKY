Quality has gone down. I've been coming here since 2011 and unfortunately it's all about profit now.

My favorite no.37 Chimichanga has shrunk in size. Our party of four had three and all were alot smaller than it used to.

Limes served with drinks were precut and extremely dry. Our party saw five dry lime slices. Not good.

I would say Roberto's is better and cheaper :( owners: please fix the quality.
