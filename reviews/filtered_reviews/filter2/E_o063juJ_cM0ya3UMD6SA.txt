Hate doing this but for a 13$ margarita after tip I had to. I came in for a Cadillac margarita with hornitos and grand marnier like I did last week. I got a different glass and a different liquor. I asked if it had grand manier, since I seen what looked like a citrus patron bottle on the counter. She said they were out of grand marnier! How Do you run out of grand marnier at a Mexican restaurant?  I seen three bottles of grand marnier sitting on the shelf a foot away from me.
