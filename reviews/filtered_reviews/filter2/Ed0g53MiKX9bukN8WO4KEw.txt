The tables in the bar area are super small, so don't plan on getting much food. It won't fit. The tacos were pretty good, except the veggie one. They are going out of business, so they don't have all of the liquors listed on the menu. Slow service. Ambience is somewhere between modern and college with color changing bar lights.
