Service is slow and relaxed. If you are not patient or are in a rush maybe not the best place. We weren't greeted for 7 minutes. 3 tacos took 25 minutes. But they were delicious. Our server told us nothing. The server at the table behind us explained the menu and threw out some special facts. Glad I listened in. There Are 10 selections of tacos from carne asada skirt steak, chicken, beef, pork, veggie, mahi mahi, shrimp, bean and cheese, and ground beef. Tacos come 1 to an order and are $3.25-$4.25 a piece. There are 10 selections of "other stuff" from tamales to enchiladas to ceviche. 8 selections of side dishes and 3 deserts. 8 specialty cocktails that are all $9 and 19 beers on tap from $5-$12. Happy hour is 3-6 mon to fri. Happy hour specials are 5 food selections from $2-$3 and 5 drinks for $2.50-$4. 12 simple bottled beer ranging from $4-$5 and a more complex selection of bottled beer from $6-$12. There are some really exquisite options of beer from $13 -$22. 12 dark malt beers from $7-$22 and hoppy-bitter beers from $6-$18. Same owner as firefly apparently. Hopefully it works out and they add more to the menu for food.  I ordered another carne asada taco because I liked it so much and it came out totally different. Same trip :/ wtf.  First week so I guess they gotta get their groove but woah work it out quick y'all. Manger checked on all the tables around us. Never checked on us. Not the best first impression.
