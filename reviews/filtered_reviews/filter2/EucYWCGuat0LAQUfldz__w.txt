I came here with my friend on a friday night and the place was busy but we were seated quickley. The decor inside is really cool! But that maybe the only good thing about this place. 
The fish and shrimp tacos were good but way over priced. They brought out one plate of beans and rice for my friend and I to share. If Im gonna pay this much for three little tacos I should get my own damn plate of beans and rice, but then again they were extremley bland and tasteless, so on second thought no thanks,

I had the jalisco margarita which was very good, but also really expensive. My friend asked the waiter if she could just get a beer with a glass of lime juice, (like a michelada) but with out the clamato, and he basically said no because there was a "lime shortage" hmmm.....I dont know about that but ok. 

The place seemed to be filled with tourists, and im sure for them this place was great, a little funky mexican restaurant off of downtown. But this local girl knows a million better less expensive mexican spots to go to.
