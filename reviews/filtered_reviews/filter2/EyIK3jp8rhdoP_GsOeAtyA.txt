Deifintely not what I had expected after giving this place a 3rd try..... never was any better than the 1st or 2nd times..... burger was way over-cooked, green chili was weak, I have had better out of a jar from El Pinto that is True New Mexico Quality... supposed Fries were potato cubes fried and no flavor other than the oil they were sitting in on the plate...  3X times and still not any better..... hard to believe the Family is the same as the real New Mexico Los Dos Molinos... that at least is excellent real New Mexican food... I walked out the 2nd time with my wife and youngest child due to poor service as well....
