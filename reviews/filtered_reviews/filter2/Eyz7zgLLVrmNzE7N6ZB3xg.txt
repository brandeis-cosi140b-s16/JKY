Awwww man! Was super pumped to finally have tacos el gordo again (after moving from San Diego to LA I've been deprived) but this location does NOT live up to it's name. The one in San Diego is so, so perfect... :'(

Basically came here last night after clubbing with my girlfriends and was having the munchies late, and happily found that this place was still open at 2am. Ordered the adobada (spicy pork) and beef tongue (langua) tacos, and shared a $10 carne Asada fries with my friend. 

The tacos were pretty good, meat was moist and good amount of cilantro & onions. 

But when I asked for salsa sauce they told me "we don't have anymore" twice (after disbelief & shock). I believed them-- only to realize moments later that plenty of people seemed to have salsa on their tables. -__- so my friend had to get it for me, because goodness knows why they hate me and won't give me any sauces. 

The carne Asada fries were baaaaad. The beef was way too dry and SUPER smokey tasting. It's like they accidentally left it to smoke for hours ... 

Basically the San Diego location trumps this one.
