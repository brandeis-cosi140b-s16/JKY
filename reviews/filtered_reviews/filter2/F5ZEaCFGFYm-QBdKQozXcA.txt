Ok so this place is probably not the best but its pretty decent. The reason we stopped here was becasue it was 10am and we were hungry. The thing that caught our eyes was the $3.49 breakfast and .99 bloody mary's. Our waitress was pretty awesome and so was the host. The food here though is not that great. DO NOT TRY THE .99 BLOODY MARYS!!! Those things are so gross but then again for .99 cents there's not much to expect. The $3.49 breakfast was just ok. The portions were super tiny though. The burritos were just ok as well. Not sure i'll be back but we'll see.
