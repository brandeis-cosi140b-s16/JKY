After hearing so much about this restaurant, I just had to try it. The decoration inside is very nice and is much better than the white exterior. Kudos to the designer for such a drab building.

The food was a C. The salsa, guacamole and a lobster green chili dip are all must haves! Terrific flavors. The crab cake is boring and doesn't have much taste. The sauce on top of it though is good and has a nice little kick. The shrimp...excellent. That's by themselves or in an enchilada! Great flavor. 

The blue seafood enchilada is ok. The halibut is sparse, tortilla dry and salmon overbearing. The shrimp though saved the dish...See, I told you the shrimp dishes were the best. 

The Taos Trio was ok as well. It could have been better if it didn't sit out for 20 minutes before being reheated because they forgot one of our dishes.  The pork tamale was decent. The red sauce overpowered the tamale, but that could have been from soaking on too for so long before service. The tenderloin relleno would have been great if delivered on time. Unfortunately, it was soggy and therefore was a C-. It could have been an A though! The best part of the Taos, you got it, the shrimp enchilada. Very good!!! Even overdone. 

Overall, decent New New Mexican food. I should have gone with the stacked enchiladas!!  It could be a 3-star Mexican restaurant, but gets a 2 this time due to the delayed service and over-cooked food. May have to try again to certify proper ranking.
