As a someone who regularly goes to Loco paton in Scottsdale, I have been to this location a few times and the service really sucks, the guys behind the bar spend all their time talking to whatever girls are on the other side of the bar. It is no wondering that this place is always pretty quite even for happy hour with this kind of thing going on. It's pretty frustrating to have to deal with. I went back as I wanted to make sure it wasn't me but the others in my group also noticed this issue. The food is only so so also.
