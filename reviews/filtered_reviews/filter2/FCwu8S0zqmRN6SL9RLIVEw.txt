We went there on Sunday for lunch. The entire experience was awkward and the service was terrible. Two of us ordered from the taco menu. When the tacos finally arrived the person who delivered them informed that one of the tacos (pork carnitas) which is one of their specialties was not available and that I needed to reorder with my server. By this time everyone in my party had their food. The server told us the kitchen did not inform her they were out of the carnitas. I reordered but 30 minutes later I still did not have my order and so we cancelled it. Took another 15 minutes to get the check. Very poor management! No teamwork! The server is the victim of poor management. The food that we did get was good. Several people were asking for their servers and two managers were running around trying to respond, but they were very disorganized!
