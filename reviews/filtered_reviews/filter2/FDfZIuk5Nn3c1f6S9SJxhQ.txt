Being at the heart of the Vegas strip this place has the chance to absolutely kill it.  Has a chance....Based on my recent visit I would have tell anyone thinking of trying this place to think twice and try something else.  There are a lot of choices when it comes to eating and drinking on the strip.  The fact that Sammy Hagar has his name attached to this place will put people in the seats, but I won't be back.

Service was poor.  Our server was much more interested in the water gun fight going on with his co-workers than he was in any of the tables.  It's Vegas you should have a good time, but the patrons should have a better time.  Everyone that was seated around us was also frustrated.

The food was a little bit below average.  For the money I was not impressed.  We had ordered some nachos, chicken enchiladas, and a Jack and Coke burger. 

The real tragedy here were the drinks.  Until the day that I ate here I had never not finished a drink.  It was so sweet that it might have actually ruined my meal.  For $10 dollars or more this was the worst margarita that I have ever had, and I have had hundreds in my life.  Nobody at the table was able to finish their margaritas, and we all had a different flavor.  I said something to our server and he said "I don't know what to tell you."  Something tells me they get that all of the time.

If I remember right there is a Fat Tuesdays down the hall inside of Planet Hollywood.  Stop there and enjoy the buzz.
