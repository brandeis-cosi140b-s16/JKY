I came to this place on a date as my date wanted something to eat and she mentioned this restaurant was in the area. I am very picky with Mexican food and I knew as soon as I walked in this was not authentic Mexican food even if it had Mexican people working there. It's you typical "Americanized" Mexican food place, I ordered the chimichanga and for the price (nearly $13) it was overpriced. I could of gone to a juliobertos or polibertos and gotten that same dish with guacamole and sour cream which the Los Olivos plate did not come with for about $9 including the drink and I would of been better off. My date had the flautas as which were bland to say the least. The service was descent which is why I gave them 2 stars, the salsa was bland and their spicy salsa was a joke. I think I was the only Mexican person eating there which was a red flag.
