Decided to try El Torito Cafe for the first time tonight because of the reviews. Here we go:
Margaritas are strong. Albondigas soup was great. The Chips are broken up store bought Tostada Shells and the House Salsa was kinda bland in flavor with a little spice. I had the Carnitas Plate which was extremely dry but tasty. My wife had (1) Soft Carnitas Taco (which was also dry) and (1) Hard Shell Carne Taco which she said was just OK. My Daughter had the A La Carte Taquitos which she thought were delicious.  If you do end up here, ask for the "other" Salsa, much better than the regular one. BTW, the Address is 2126 S Boulder Hwy, Henderson, NV 89002.
