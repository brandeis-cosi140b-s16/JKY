This place is loud, has obnoxious servers, pretty lousy food, and thinks it's clever because of bad puns on the menu. 

That said, some of the food is good and it's better than most other Oakland options (which is damning with faint praise). Things that are okay: carnitas burrito, mahi-mahi salad (w/o the chipoltle aioli), pineapple habanero salsa. The margaritas are okay, but if you claim to be anything "mex", you better have okay margaritas.

On the whole, this place needs to turn down the music, turn up the lights, make the menu a little less colorful and focus on having consistent service and food prep. Oh, and while I'm at it, that blue cornbread is disgusting.

Oh, and to say that it's not good for kids is an understatement. They play very loud music with explicit lyrics and have drunk people stumbling around at 5pm. Leave junior at home.
