I recently told a friend that I cant figure out why there is no good Mexican restaurants in Tempe. His response was what about MacAyo's? I responded with "why are there no good Mexican food restaurants in Tempe?"

Seriously if anyone out there knows of any legit Mexican in Tempe let me know. And don't say restaurant Mexico!
