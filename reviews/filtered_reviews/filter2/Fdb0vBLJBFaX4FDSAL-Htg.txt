The food is good, well prepared and very well presented.  The atmosphere is like eating inside a disco coliseum with the giant ceiling of the Luxor overhead and the house beats throbbing.  The service is attentive and neat.  The speed at which the food arrives is very good...which brings me to my main problem with this place.

I have lived in San Diego for a Loooong time and traditional Mexican food is a standard part of my diet.  The same core ingredients (in the correct proportions) make up the majority of the menu at virtually every Mexican food joint.  Good beans.  Nice rice.  Slow cooked Pork, Chicken, and Beef.  Add a few sauces, salsas, cheeses and tortillas and you just covered the entire menu...which is why your food comes out fast.  So when you tell me three street style tacos cost $17, you already lost me.

Are they good tacos?  Yes.  

Are they magic tacos?  No.

Will the beans grow a magic beanstalk? Not to my knowledge.

Is paying $20 for $9 plate of food a good bet?  I'll leave that for you to decide.  After all, this is Vegas.
