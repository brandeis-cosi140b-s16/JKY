Food was ok but this was a disappointing experience. The Margaritas were very good. The Guacamole was tasty but the menu description very misleading. The menu said the guacamole was created table side, but the truth is that you have to order the large size or it just arrives already put together from the kitchen. It arrived with ridiculously large chunks of avocado which meant we either got a chunk of avocado on our chip or all of the other ingredients, but it was too difficult to get both combined on a chip. They charge for chips and they were very average - not worth paying for.  My chicken enchilada was tasty but arrived with some chunks of chicken parts I prefer not to see let alone put in my mouth. The serving staff is friendly, but our server was inattentive despite the fact the restaurant was fairly empty. I saw one of the staff act like he was going to kick a tray filled with glasses out of another server's hand - not very professional! I live in Scottsdale Old Town and love to find local places to dine, This might be fine for a tourist just passing through, but I will not be returning as there are too many other restaurants in town that deserve my support.
