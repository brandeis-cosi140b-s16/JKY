The two stars are just for service and ambiance, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the view of Las Vegas is beautiful, the food lacks in taste and quality though.  I had high hopes when we pulled in to meet another couple for dinner as the parking lot was full.  The food is on the mild side which cater to milder palettes.  My friend ordered the marinated pork chops, expecting 3 succulent chops only to find 3 thin slices of pork chops, which looked as if a pork chop was sliced into three.  Her fiance ordered the green chili burrito combo asking for just beans, cheese, rice, and sauce since he is a vegetarian, but they added pork into it.  My bf ordered a cobb salad and enchilada a la carte and did not enjoy his meal.  I ordered the Carnitas Fajitas and did not enjoy the taste.  It did not taste fresh and it lacked flavor...tasted like it was never marinated and came out of a slow cooker.  I actually took it back to the hotel room and doused it with the salsa I had leftover from the catering truck we purchased our breakfast from earlier, which was much cheaper and had more flavor.  Since some other reviewers raved about the "delicious and different corn tortillas", I ordered those with my meal to find stale corn tortillas that were most likely store bought, not homemade at all.  While I was packing my takeout container, they staff quickly took the tortillas...maybe to reuse since mine tasted old and stale?  As far as the salsa and beans served with chips prior to ordering the meal, the chips were cold, salsa was very bland, beans were nothing remarkable.  The fideo soup actually did have good flavor, but lacked substance.  The atmosphere was also very loud with music, so it is not a place to gather for people who are trying to catch up.  They were very busy so I am sure they will not miss our business.  I have had much better Mexican food in other restaurants and taco shops/stands.
