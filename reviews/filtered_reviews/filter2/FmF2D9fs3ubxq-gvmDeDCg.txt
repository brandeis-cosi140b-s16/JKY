Asked for apples on side...they still put them in the syrup.  No butter...ordered French toast.  Deliver driver couldn't even give me a $5 back for change.  Last time, I ordered a milk shake with my burger...no straw.  

I won't order from them until I'm told they have tightened up a bit.  Considering the lackadaisical effort, the $1 delivery charge is a crock of shit. 

Food is usually alright from what I remember.  Was alright this time.  I'm still all set with them.
