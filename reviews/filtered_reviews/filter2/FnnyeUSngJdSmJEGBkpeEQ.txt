I felt like I was eating at a bar/lounge instead of a nice restaurant. But I paid like I was at a nice restaurant.

Perhaps like some others have said I'm spoiled with Mexican food back in California but it was simply okay. One person at our table ordered a $20 quesadilla which we assumed would be spectacular for $20... Nope. Just a quesadilla with a small amount of guac and sour cream on the side.

The worst part was the $18 margaritas. They basically tasted like sour mix and weren't large. I might as well have gone into the casino just out the door (remember it's a lounge as much as a restaurant) and gamble away my $18 and gotten a free house margarita with the 1% chance of winning something.

The service was good which was a bummer because I felt compelled to tip well since the expensive crappy food wasn't there fault. Oh the two stars are for the decent unlimited chips and salsa!!
