I've been here a few times, but my last visit is the one that warranted a review. I won't compare their tacos to a real Baja fish taco, as they are two different animals - so here is an unbiased review...hopefully 

I was going to give them a 3, as the experience with the waitress was very strange. After we got through our meal though, she seemed to warm up a lil' and had a change of heart. But then I just remembered #6 so back to 2 it is. 

Ya ready? 

1. I asked for corn tortillas and the reply was simply "no" followed by silence.....ooooookaaaay awkward, moving on, forget I ever asked. 

2. Queso dip = yuck. Chips were cold and stale and the dip was very watery. 

3. Black bean soup = double yuck. Pureed black beans. Dark black soup is not appealing, lol. Even worse when it's bland. 

4. White Fish Tacos = Okay, not bad. Lightly battered, but fairly crispy. 
a. But they sprinkled parsley on the taco. Parsley??? Parsley is NOT a substitute for cilantro. 

5. Baja rice. Really? It was rice pilaf with a mango salsa puree on top. Pilaf, and baja rice are two very different flavors. Plus the rice was crunchy and kinda bland. It was called Baja, so I expected some type of Spanish rice, lol. 

6. My rice had hair in it. 

I'll come back though.... 

for drinks. It's a pretty cool spot, minus the food. And As TR P mentioned, you can tell, you can taste that the food just wasn't made with any love or care. Quality was nonexistent. 

On the positive side though, it is in Noda.
