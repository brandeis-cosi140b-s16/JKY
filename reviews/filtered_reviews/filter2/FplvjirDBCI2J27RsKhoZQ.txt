2 stars is being generous for my overall experience today.  I hadn't been to a Cantina 1511 since it's East Blvd days so when I was in South Charlotte to meet my husband and mother-in-law for lunch, I was all in when she suggested we meet at the Rea Road location.  We met at 11:30 and were one of about 3-4 tables.  My husband and MIL had ordered queso dip before I had arrived.  They do their own interperation of queso dip, its not the delicious goodness you find at all other Mex restaurants and it was just ok.  Service was decent, a polite young girl took our order after I arrived but that quickly went downhill after more people started coming in, though it was far from busy.  Towards the end of our meal, I ended up going to the waitress station and grabbing a water pitcher as both my husband and I were completely out of water and hadn't been checked on in quite some time.  My MIL had the cobb salad and didn't have any complaints.  My husband had the Enchiladas Tejanos.  He thought it was oily and overall not enjoyable (the man rarely complains about anything.)  I had the Enchiladas De Pollo.  It completely lacked ANY kind of flavor and was drowned in the queso dip.  Literally tasted like a plain rolled up tortilla covered in cheese and not in a good way.  Our waitress didn't even ask if everything was ok when I clearly hadn't eaten half of what was on my plate and obviously didn't ask for it to be boxed up.  Wanted to like this place as a location opened a short while ago at Park Road Shopping Center, just .25 miles from my house.  VERY DISAPPOINTED and wouldn't go back.
