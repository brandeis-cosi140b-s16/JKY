Lets start with what I liked... the horchata, tortillas, guacamole, salsa, and cheese is nice! I also liked the interior design.

Now, customer service sucked. The girl at the register (receipt said "cindy") had an attitude,  didnt smile or have any facial expression for that matter and she had too much makeup on which, as a chef, I dont like to see in a kitchen.

As far as the rest of the staff goes I was disappointed to see none of them wear hats or hair nets. There were numerous employees eating on the line in plane site of customers, there were 2 little kids working as well that didnt appear to be washing their hands after touching their face or hair or after going outside.

The lady handling the drinks took forever. We actually received our food before we got our drinks, and I had to remind her at that point of what we ordered because the receipt only showed the sizes and not which beverage. 

So as excited as I was to go here for the first time, I must say it was a bad experience, and will not be going back for a second visit...
