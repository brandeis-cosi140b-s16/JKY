I have been here twice.  The food is really good...the service, not so much.  The first time, the waitress was swamped, so we gave her some leeway.  This time, the server looked like he'd rather be anywhere but serving our table.  My friend ordered a drink which he had to remind the server twice to bring.  He rarely came to our table and when we asked him about desserts, he just about rolled his eyes and sighed.

But...the part that will cause me to not go back to Frank and Lupes -- There were ants on the rim of my water glass.  Dead, but still ants.  I showed it to the busboy who promptly took it away, but still...ants.

While the food is good (the salsa is yummy!), I am disappointed in the service and the cleanliness.
