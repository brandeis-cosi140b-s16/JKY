My family and I were trekking all over last night and I made them come here based on the great Yelp reviews. I now feel extremely guilty for dragging them there. The food was ok, the Yucatan pork was good and my carne asada tacos were ok but small and overpriced. My kids hated their kids meals and my husband said it was the worst carne asada quesadilla he has ever had. Our bill was over $100 (we all had water) and we all left feeling completely unsatisfied.
