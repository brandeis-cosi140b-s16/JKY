Very slow service which is not ideal for an airport setting. It took the waiter 10 minutes to even take my drink order. Then, when I was in the middle of ordering... he walked away mid sentence. The food was decent but it was overpriced for one margarita and a plate of chicken nachos. My total was $28. Too much for terrible service and sub par service. Pass!
