I came here looking to cure my hangover looking for some great tacos. Well I dropped by on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. They offered all you can eat for 24.99 or so so I went ahead and went with it. I tried a few things on there menu but all of it just didn't hit the spot. I am a huge Mexican Food snob especially coming from New Mexico but all of this food was just "Gringo" food there was no spice to anything and all of it was pretty bland.  Even if the food was bad the service should of made up for it but I was wrong. I sat at the bar area and was ignored the majority of the time. I kept having to get up and ask the hostess for things as well as to pay. I really wouldn't recommend coming to this place at all.
