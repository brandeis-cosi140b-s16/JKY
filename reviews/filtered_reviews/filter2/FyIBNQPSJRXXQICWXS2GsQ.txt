We ate at Leticia's for the third and last time. We had a party of six with two children We ordered 3 soups, 2 flautas and one plate of street tacos so not an over abundance of food that should take a lot of time.  It took over 45 minutes for our food to arrive It was 2 in the afternoon and it seems like a normal afternoon crowd. The food was okay but when you wait that long with children it is unacceptable. My son in law ordered a side of jalapenos and onions and the waitress brought them out 10 minutes before his food..we didn't have to pay for them because he sent them back.  Tres leche cake was terrible ..only pineapple was used and canned at that. I recommend finding somewhere else to go..
