Let's start with starters! Chips and salsa are 1.99! Not cool! Food was mediocre  at best!! $40 for two people for lunch is ridicules. No lunch specials! Place was half empty and service was horrible!! Lemonade was watered down! Would never go back! I'm a regular at Lindo Michochan and taco taco so I may be bias but this place doesn't even come close to those places!! How this place has 4 stars is beyond me!!! Horrible!!
