Came here for a sponsored event that included open bar and some free food.

There were only two servers at the one food station which caused the food line to be incredibly long.  The food options were also pretty limited (not sure if it was due to the sponsorship).  At one point of the night, the top bar had run out of Dos Equis, without a sign they were going to replenish.  

The atmosphere and amenities are geared towards a younger crowd - unfinished wood tables and chairs.

Though the service a bit off, everyone was very nice.
