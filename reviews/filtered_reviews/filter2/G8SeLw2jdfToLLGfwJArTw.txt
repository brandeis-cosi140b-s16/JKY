Well to say the least the place is dated 80's 90's look. It has a dirty feel to it. As for food... The chips they brought us tasted bland and were t my favorite. The spinach enchiladas was palatable but nothing to write him about. My partner had the Pollo fondido was dry inside and wasn't  fried long enough either as it was mushy.   We won't be back again as there are many other Mexican places that are much better.
