Errr.. This place is sort of like me I guess - am i Chinese, Indonesian or American? China Poblano is having an identity crisis. The place is built and decorated quite nicely. It's very attractive. However, their menu is confusing. Yes, fusion can be great but this place is not fusing anything together. The menu is basically divided into either Mexican or Chinese. There's nothing thats Mexican AND Chinese - nothing like carnitas filled steamed buns or wonton tacos. You know what I mean....
The only thing that was edible is the Twenty Vegetables fried rice. 
Their wonton noodle soup is meh. My friend's Mongolian beef is so strange - it's more like salad with little pieces of beef tossed over it. Ha ha 
Anyways, service is okay and I still need to figure out why they overcharged my debit card...not very happy with this. Tsk
