Great spot for drinks and it has a great vibe. Hostess often aloof and chilly, but wait staff was outstanding and friendly. Chips and salsa are good.

My major critique here is that the focus seems to be on making the food 'interesting' instead of simply 'good'. 

Don't get me wrong, I applaud culinary creativity, and some of the fixings offered a nice touch to some of the dishes, but it's just not what you think of when imagine "going out for Mexican food". And worse, you have to eat all your chips and salsa to get full because the plates are a little small-ish.

The tequila menu is very nice. As I mentioned, this a great spot for drinks, but the food is not the highlight of La Comida.
