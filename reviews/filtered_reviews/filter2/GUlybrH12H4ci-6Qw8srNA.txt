I never judge a restaurant negatively from just one visit.  I given this restaurant 3 opportunities to earn my satisfaction when I go out for Jazz on the Lke.  It just doesn't seem like it's going to happen.  The food is just okay but the service is just far below standards and super slow, especially given where it's located.
