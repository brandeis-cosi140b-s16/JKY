I had a layover and needed to grab and low carb bite.  Wasn't a lot of selection at the airport until  I ran into this place.  INitially I thought it was comparable to Chipotle...boy was I wrong...They offer more options but the quality and quantity failed.  I ordered the salad bowl with steak (garlic lime dressing) and added guacamole.  The food was prepped fast.  My first biggest disappointment was the size.  For over $8.00, it came in a tiny bowl.  The steaks were really small.  My guac (whiched I paid extra for)  actually took up most of the top.  The dressing flavor was good.  Just wished it was a bigger portion.
