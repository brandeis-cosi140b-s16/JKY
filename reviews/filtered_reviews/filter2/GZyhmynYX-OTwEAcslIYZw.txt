I'm from New Mexico and maybe I was hoping that it would be like the New Mexican food I am used to.  I had the Frito pie which is a New Mexico staple.  I found it a little strange that the ground beef was not cooked in the red chile.   I understand that they try and cater to everyone including vegetarians but it seemed like there wasn't enough chile on the dish so it seemed a little dry.  I will say that the sopapillas are delicious.  I will give it another try to see if I can find something on the menu to remind me of home.
