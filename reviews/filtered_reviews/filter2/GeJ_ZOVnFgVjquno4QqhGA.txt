T&T Tummy and Trauma.
after about 5 minutes the busboy showed up with chip ad salsa (not that good, old chips and salsa was bottle stuff)  and i ordered an Ice Tea from him, which came pretty quick. i did have time to look over the menu so i had the kid take my order 3 taco combo plate. chicken, carnitas and carne asada with rice & black beans. i did ask  the kid if they all came on corn tortillas. (told me he would check) within 2 minutes the kid has back and said yes all corn, ok put the order in. he did tell me that he was just a busboy, i told him will now your my waiter thanks. 
1) Rice and Black Beans.
Neither of them had any good flavor, rice was overcooked and the black beans was just uneatable. horrible
2) The Tacos.
the Asada and Chicken tacos had no flavor  over cooked chicken, the asada taco meat was also over cooked with no flavor. The Carnitas taco was pretty good, if i knew i would of just had 3 of them. Carnitas had seasoned pork and a little heat to them was by far the best of the 3 tacos. One other problem with the tacos you only get 1 tortilla on each taco, so after the first bite the bottom drops out and your eating them with a fork.
Only time a saw the waiter was when he brought the check..LOL yeah sure dick head i'm going to tip you. LOL Idiot. 
The Kid got a good tip, the waiter wannabe .25 cents. 
Food is way over priced for what you get. mini tacos  with rice and beans $18. Ice Tea $3.99. Yep $22 for a $5 Del Taco Meal. This is easily a 1 star but i gave 2 because of the kid.
