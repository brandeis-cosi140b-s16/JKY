I was very unimpressed with this place. Food blah and atmosphere felt like I was in the cafeteria back in school. The only food that was good we're the sides. I enjoyed the jerk fried rice, black beans and the free snickerdoodle cookie was yummy. I ordered the combination of Diablo chicken- gross and jerk chicken- also gross. It's flavorless grilled chicken with some toppings(seasoning) thrown on right before they bring it out. This was my first time here and I see no reason to give it a second chance. I was disappointed because my mom and brother rave about this place. Don't think I'll be following any more suggestions from them.
