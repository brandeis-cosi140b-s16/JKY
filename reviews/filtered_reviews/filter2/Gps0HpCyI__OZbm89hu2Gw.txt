Ruru's has a great patio, but good luck getting a seat out there. I'm not sure why this place is all the rave. The service sucked (only got to order one drink, food runner brought the silverware, had to flag the server down for the check),the food was ok (nothing to get excited about) and the other patrons were very uppity (if you live in this neighborhood you're expected to eat at this restaurant). Don't go to Rurus if you're looking for the creative crowd in CLT. If you'd like delicious tacos, fun atmosphere and a great patio go to Chuy's.
