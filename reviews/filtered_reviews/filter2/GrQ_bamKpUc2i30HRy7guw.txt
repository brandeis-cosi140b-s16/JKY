Four years ago, this Mad Mex was one of the first local restaurants we had tried in Pittsburgh while family was in town. The service had been mediocre, the food was underwhelming, and the margaritas were poor. My margarita was so terrible that I sent it back. (That's the one and only time that I have ever sent a drink back.) I avoided eating at Mad Mex for two years until I gave the Monroeville location a try. After drinking and dining at the Monroeville location multiple times over the last couple years, I fell in love with this local Mexican chain.  

While in the middle of some bar hopping last night, my group and I made Mad Mex our last stop. I had such high hopes after our Monroeville experience... but I was disappointed yet again. We started with appetizers which were pretty good. However, our waitress was not the nicest. We arrived at 9:30, and several people at the table ordered beer while I anxiously waited for the Big Azz Margarita special to begin at 10:00. At 9:58, I asked the waitress if it was 10:00 yet, and she curtly answered "no" and walked away, not returning for at least 10-15 minutes. I was so frustrated by her that none of us ordered margaritas, and we all ended up leaving the restaurant shortly after. 

My advice would be to drive out to the suburbs and dine at the Mad Mex in Monroeville, where I have consistently had a completely opposite experience.
