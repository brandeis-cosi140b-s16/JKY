With all the places in Vegas to chose from, this place definitely needs to kick it up a notch.  The atmosphere and ambiance are great...so if you were looking for a place to grab a basket of chips and some drinks at the bar, I'd be down.  But the food was just OK.  It could be that I am spoiled when it comes to awesome Mexican food seeing that I am from So Cal where authentic and awesome Mexican joints are on every corner.  

Since it was just "OK" for me, I really don't have much to say about the place.  Don't get me wrong...the food was edible and tasted decent, it just wasn't memorable or anything to write home about.  If you are in the casino and hungry, give it a try.  Everyones taste buds are a little different anyway.
