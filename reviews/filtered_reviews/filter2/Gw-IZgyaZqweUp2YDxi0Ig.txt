My husband and I went Friday night happy hour.  The service was great, they were very busy.  It is a very nice place, good crowd, we sat outside.  Everyone has different taste.  Just saying.  We had the Cocktel De Elote aka street corn, delish.  We both went through that.  Also the Cartinas En Chile Verde.  The decription sounded yummy, but was not very good, we left most of it.  And then also we had the Carne Asada street tacos, bland, not alot of flavor.  The chips were good and the salsa was good.  My husband loved the salsa, for me it had a late burn that cought up with me.  We might try it again, try something else on the menu, always willing to give a place a second try.
Happy hour, three apps and we each had two drinks / beer and wine - $40 plus tip
