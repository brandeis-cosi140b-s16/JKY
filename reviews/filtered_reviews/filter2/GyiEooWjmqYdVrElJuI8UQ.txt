Went in for lunch and ordered a carne asada torta.  For some reason they actually serve it with fries...I'm still trying to figure that one out.  As for the torta, it wasn't bad but the meat tasted more stewed than grilled.

One thing that's not good at all is the parking...forewarned is forearmed.  

Overall, serviceable Mexican food but nothing special.
