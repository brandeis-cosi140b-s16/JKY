If you want nice patio dining where you can  people watch and feel like you're in some cute European city with cobbled streets and the "wheel" as a backdrop, this is the place. But the food is overpriced and disappointing. Shrimp fajitas were covered in a messy red sauce and texture of shrimp was spongy and frozen tasting. Lobster tacos were pieces of fried batter, had to hunt for the lobster. I give it 2 stars only because the chips and salsa were good. Would not come here again.
