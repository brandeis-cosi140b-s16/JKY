I think this place could be better if you do not order take out food from there.  I work about a half mile from this place, which should allow more than enough time to get your food back to work without it being cold when you get there.  This was not the case today.  I am not a fan of cold, soggy french fries.  The fries had the potential to be good but when they are cold and soggy I just can't do it.  The BIGGER issue was the burger I ordered.  This burger was RARE.  I don't eat burgers unless they are well done.  I bit into this burger and the taste was of raw meat.  I went in to the kitchen at work to cook it further and had to cook it through our little oven TWICE to get all the red out of the center of the burger.  There is no excuse in my book for serving someone a burger that has barely touched a grill unless someone specifically orders it that way, and I most certainly did not.  I really don't think I will eat here again but if you do get food here, eat at the restaurant, do not order to go.  You will be disappointed.
