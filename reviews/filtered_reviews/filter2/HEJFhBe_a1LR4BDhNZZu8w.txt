My husband and I have been looking for good Mexican food since we moved here 9 months ago. We have yet to find it...
We both ordered the super steak burritos which were just ok. The quesadilla was super greasy, but kinda yummy. Super spicy red salsa was great. Horchatas were ok from what I've experienced. The cleaning crew was using some chemical that caused most everyone to sneeze. They continued to mop around everyone for the entire time that we were there. It was extremely unappetizing. 
All in all it was just ok and we won't be going back.
