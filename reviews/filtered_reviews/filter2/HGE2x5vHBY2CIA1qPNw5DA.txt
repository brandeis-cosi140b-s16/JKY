We've been coming here since we moved to Phoenix and it was great.
Never had any problems with the food , or service or the restaurant.
Mind you, we've been here weekends and week days. Busy or slow time and no issues.
I have enjoyed "brunch" time on Sunday's sitting on the patio sipping a mimosa and eating Huevos Ranchero.
But this past year the quality has just seemed to have gone down. The food is not as tasty as it used to be , the quality seems as if they have changed suppliers to save on cost since the textures on some of our choices has been a bit off.
Two months or so we went in for dinner and the enchiladas just seemed like the cheese was thrown in and microwaved. The spicy "Mexican" flavors were non existent. And my husband kept pointing out the lack of cleanliness inside as well. The decorations are dusty and there were cobwebs! Ouch!
Last night we went in and there was just no flavor and the tortillas for the enchiladas tasted old :(
There are other places to try. 
I'm still looking that great Mexican food!
