Am I ordering wrong? Been here a few times just to make sure, but all visits left me craving real Mexican food even more. Roberto's didn't do it for me :-( Tried several items on different occasions and all were pretty boring - nothing special.

Tried: Chicken enchiladas,  chicken tacquitos, chicken quesadilla, crunchy chicken and beef tacos, rice & beans etc.

I've never had their burritos,  so maybe that is the ticket??
