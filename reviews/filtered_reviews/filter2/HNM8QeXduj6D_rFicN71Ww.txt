Food great. Drinks great. Hostess amazing. Bus boy amazing. Although our waitress wouldn't say a word or aknowledge that we were there. The bus boy did all the work. She was the tall dark skinned woman with short curly hair and wore glasses. Working the evning shift 6/24/2015 she clearly hates her job. But we still said thank you and tipped her.
