My first visit to Carolina's is now my last.  Not impressed with this place, whatsoever.  Prices were low but so was the quality of the food.  My green chili burro was bland and the beef chunks were tough as nails.  The green corn tamale was a mushy mess.   The chips were over cooked and tasted like cardboard.  The salsa was nothing to write home about.  However the tortilla on the burrito was awesome.  If you're looking for a GREAT green chili burro...go to RITO's.
