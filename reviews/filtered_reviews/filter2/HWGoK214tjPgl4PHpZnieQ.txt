After eating here, it all boils down to one term, mediocre. Me and my fiancee both purchased a torta, and while service was excellent, the food was just, well, average. One thing that hit me was how low quality the ingredients were, the meats tasted like they were purchased in the lunch meat aisle at a supermarket, and brand X meat at that. It didn't taste fresh, and in my sandwich's case (the La Reyna) like they used the cheapest sausage they could find. The breaded chicken on the sandwich had extremely sweet and cheap tasting batter on it. Even the egg tasted like it came out of a carton. Perhaps I just picked a poor sandwich, but my fiancee was not a fan of the Del Ray either, one of their favorite menu items.

Since I do not want to focus on the bad, our drinks were constantly attended to, the food came quickly, and for the price vs filling your belly was positive. Then again when you use such, apparently, cheap ingredients it is no wonder they can keep prices low!

It was a unique experience, just to see the massive sandwiches but we will not be going back.
