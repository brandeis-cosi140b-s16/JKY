Came on a Saturday afternoon with my family of five. We were seated right away (as the place was empty) and given a trio of salsa. Pace yourself because any refills are a charge. Kids meals came out quickly. Corn dog and chicken strips were fine but my daughter's beef taco was not edible. Not only was the meat completely void of taste but the shell was stale. We got chicken nachos for the table. Not sure what the other food tasted like because the combo of oil, dried out chicken, and canned chilies, my stomach hurt too bad to eat anything else. My husband did seem pleased with his carne asada grill entree. 

The restaurant layout was fine and the waiter was nice but I would not return.
