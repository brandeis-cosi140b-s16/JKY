The people who patronize this establishment are the kind of people that bring their babies and/or children to the bar on Friday night. 

Just stop and think about that for a moment.

You have a baby.................. in a bar???

To add insult to injury, the Chupacabra margarita tastes like dirty, soapy ass. How dare they insult my precious X Files by naming this horrific drink after the mystical character that Fox and Dana chased after in one of my favorite episodes ever? Blasphemy. 

Finally, I will close this review with the tweet I sent whilst using the ladies restroom (yes, I tweet and pee at the same time):

"If you are ever looking for a dirty, sloppy, drunken lay then head to the womens restroom at salty senorita peoria"


Oh, PS... Thanks to Andrew K I just realized I missed the most important text of the night:

"I'm too drunk to be alive. Sincerely, in hell in Peoria"
