I just heard about this new addition to the area and made it in for a Friday night dinner.  While a bit tough to find from the Providence Road entrance, a subtle entry opens way to an impressively laid out restaurant.  The spacious bar and seating promotes a good atmosphere within the confines of the building but, untested is the elaborate outside bar setup which looks to be a must-go for warmer weather drinks.

The drinks were, simply, fantastic.  The food, however, was fantastically simple.  I'll lend some leniency given it's time on the scene, and give them credit for managing easy-to-miss operational issues like service quality and time.  As other reviews note, no freebees here, but the chips trio was great with very generously portioned guac/salsa/queso.  Calling it like it is, the food needs works.  The taste is short and I think the restaurant knows it as they appear to try to compensate with over serving taco-sauces (aioli, ranch-blah, etc.).  

Quite frankly, I'll be back b/c I loved the bar, loved the atmosphere and the food wasn't inedible, it just wasn't that good.  So I'll manage expectations accordingly.  I'm hoping that I can review the review upward in time to come.
