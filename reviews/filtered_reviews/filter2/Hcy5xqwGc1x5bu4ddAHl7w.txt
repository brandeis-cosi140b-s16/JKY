What I had: Pork Barbacoa Tostada (Taco Salad), Papaya/Mango Agua Fresca

Price Total: $11.08
 
The Good: Fresh Ingredients, Lots of topping choices

The Bad: WAY TOO EXPENSIVE! Essentially this place is doing the exact same thing Chipotle and Zaba's does only Chipotle and Zaba's do it better for cheaper. A single Taco here costs $5 to start with. My tostada (which was more like a Taco Salad) was $9 BEFORE I even ordered a drink! They don't fry the shell like most other places would. You could get 2 HUGE Taco Salads from Roberto's Taco Shop for the price of 1 REGULAR one here. This place prides itself on the idea that they make their own tortillas and the fact they have pork barbacoa. (1) Their tortillas are bland and there is NOTHING special about them. (2) Their pork barbacoa is tangy and tasty but it tastes like that cheap BBQ you would get at a buffet. "Tacos El Gordo" makes MUCH BETTER Barbacoa for only $2/taco. The Agua Fresca I had here was $2.50 but "La Flor de Michoacan Artisinal" makes MUCH BETTER Agua Fresca and gives you a HUGE cup for the same price or less. When I got to the register, the manager asked me if I want the "house dressing" which looked like guacamole. I said no and then he said something weird like "Well, since he didn't get the house dressing, don't charge him for the sour cream" (implying that normally I would have to pay EXTRA for the sour cream), which was NOT explained to me as I ordered it.

The Ugly: There seems to be a racial divide in this place. It seems to be run by Mormons. There are NO BLACK PEOPLE on the staff and there's 20-30 people working there (Note: Mormons don't like Black people). There are some Mexicans working there but they get the crappy kitchen jobs while the Mormons get the cushy easy jobs.

They offer "curb side service" instead of having a drive-thru. This actually screws traffic and the parking lot up.
