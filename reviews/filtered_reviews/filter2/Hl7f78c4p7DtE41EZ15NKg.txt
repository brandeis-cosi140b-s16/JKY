After reading the reviews of this restaurant's other locations, I am at a complete loss for words -- is this supposed to be some great local gem or something? What it seemed like to me was a big old Mexican chain restaurant full of overpriced cheddar-filled enchiladas. It wasn't *bad* food, but it was unremarkable.
I came here for lunch and was seated promptly. The chips and salsa were quite tasty. I was surprised to see the prices on the lunch menu, though -- $10-$11 for vegetarian dishes like cheese enchiladas or a veggie burrito seemed really high. I went with the burrito, enchilada style. It tasted good. The tortilla was a bit chewy but the veggies were nice. 
Ok.
That's it.
I get that this is supposed to be "Mexican city" style food, whatever that means. I didn't really notice that it had unique flavors to Mexico city, or any other region of Mexico, for that matter.
Sigh.

I STILL haven't found a fantastic Mexican restaurant in this city of, what, 5 million people? I'm getting really frustrated. It's been three years! On to the next one...
