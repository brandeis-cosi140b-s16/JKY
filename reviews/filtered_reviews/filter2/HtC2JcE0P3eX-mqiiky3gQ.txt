Has anyone noticed that the quality has gone WAY down recently? The carne asada has almost no flavor. The chips taste like they've been cooked in old, stale oil. The meat is either undercooked, or past its prime. Chicken in the tacos tasted like jerky, with a stale shell. I LOVE this place. I love the people that work there. This needs to get better.
