Two co-workers and I stopped for lunch after hitting Bass Pro. We weren't expecting much, but the decor wasn't bad overall, and the chips and salsa were quite good.

All three of our meals looked pretty tasty, but were all but flavorless. I bit into an inch-long rib bone in my chicken enchiladas. Not a great experience. Service wasn't bad, but I think there was one other table in the place.
