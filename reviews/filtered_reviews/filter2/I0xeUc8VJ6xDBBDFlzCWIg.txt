stopped in for dinner on a quick trip through phoenix with high expectations of quality Mexican food.  instead, I got overpriced, overcooked and underseasoned food combined with absent-minded service.  we started with the guacamole "prepared" table side.  the server brought out a bowl of pre-chunked avocado while dragging a cart of ingredients behind him.  "you want everything?"  sure.  he then slopped spoonfuls of each ingredient into the bowl, gave it a quick toss and laid it on our table.  I did like the pomegranate seeds but the flavors were bland and the avocado chunks were too big.  in a word, service was exceptionally lazy.  for dinner I had chicken mole enchiladas.  the mole was good but the chicken was way overcooked and very dry.  my guess is it was cooked well before dinner service started.  the globs of cheese underneath the enchiladas were not melted and not very appetizing.  I also tried a taste of the pork taco.  the pork was tender but also lacked flavor.
