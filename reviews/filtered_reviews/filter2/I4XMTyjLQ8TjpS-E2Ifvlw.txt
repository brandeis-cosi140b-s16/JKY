have been going to all the Mexican restaurant in town last couple of weeks to see where I would like to go for cinco de mayo. my take on Javier's is that while the food was decent the prices are crazy. the guacamole is very good but their salsa is no. drinks were ok. I would go back but only if I had a groupon 1/2 off.
