Meh. That's exactly how I feel about this place. The complimentary chips and salsa are good. In fact, the red salsa is really good. But the food kind of sucks. I'm not even trying to be mean. The beans taste alright. The rice sucks. I ordered the Shrimp Ajo (garlic shrimp). It was rubbery and didn't even taste like garlic. I've had Camarones al mojo de Ajo plenty of times. This was by far the worst. 

My friend had the combo plate with two tacos, which was also terrible. They use cheap, packaged taco shells. They're not even fresh. I rather go to Del Taco or Taco Bell. 

BUT... Despite that, we had a nice time on the patio. There was this dude playing acoustic songs. The Beerita wasn't too bad. A little tangy at first but the tequila allowed us to enjoy the afternoon here.

I doubt I'll ever come here again. Unless it's for drinks, chips and salsa while listening to live acoustic music on the patio. Nothing else.
