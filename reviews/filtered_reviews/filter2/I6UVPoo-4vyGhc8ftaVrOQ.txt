I want to say that I kept an open mind. The atmosphere is very comfy and warm. We wanted to give Viva Mercados another chance as we ate there a few years back and the quality was not good. My experience is this...
the ceviche is wonderful but the salsa is very watered down and the beans are not fresh. The fideo soup was good. I ordered a corona light and it took a long time to get it, lets say our entrees came out first. My husbands drink was mountain dew and they refilled it 3 times with water. I never like ice tea nor water as most people don't know it sits. The A grade was not visible,  very questionable about temps and cleanliness.
Me and my husband ordered fajitas and they were overdone and not sizzling and worse is that the meat was very chewy and our rice was not hot. We got a new one remade that was better with more broth and it came out sizzling this time but the rice was not hot again. The albondiga soup I took home was not good. The albondigas fell apart and it looked like minestrone soup, I threw it away. Now, the churros are excellent!!! I work in the F & B industry and I hate sending food back but as a paying customer I was disappointed and have a right. I personally feel it is overpriced for the dining experience.
