Walked in and was greeted by MONIQUE, with a smiling face and seated us quickly at a high top. The table was dirty and the 2 girls next to us weren't happy with their service. We asked for someone to wipe off the table which was excited promptly. We still have not been served by a server. Then, Jered, scowled at us and rudely commented that we, "get your bag out of the walk way! It's a danger to public!" No excuse me ma'am. No hey this Is a hazard to our server can you please move your bag. We mentioned that he was rude and it was uncalled for and he scoffed at us and shrugged his shoulders with a whatever remark! I get it! You rotate customers and never see them again. I am a Manager at a very Corporate restaurant in California. If my servers did this I would have them suspended until further training! Tye, the Manager, was sweet and tried to resolve the issue. But, even with that I will ensure that none of our clients or my restaurant friends return to your establishment! The two stars was for Tye and Monique. I will be sure to spread the word about the service here!
