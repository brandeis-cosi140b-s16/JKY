I really didn't expect much from this place as it seems to be really a bar before restaurant. I also did get a groupon deal for $30 for $15 which eased the pain. Food was blah and boring. My wife had Fajitas which had old looking tortillas and entirely too much onion. I had enchiladas which were just boring. 
They did have alot of outdoor seating and must systems which leans towards bar not restaurant.
The staff was friendly and courteous though.
