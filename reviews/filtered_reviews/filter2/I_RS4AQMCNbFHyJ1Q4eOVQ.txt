Over-priced, mediocre food. Over-priced under-poured drinks. Terrible service. The only thing this place has going for it is atmosphere.  Frankly, I don't understand why this place is so jam-packed with people.  Trendiness I guess. I am pretty sure we will not be not be going back.

The saving grace for this place came near the end. As we were finishing for the evening the bar manager came by and he was very friendly. I explained the irritation I had with the fact that their burgers do not come with cheese and that the waitress did not suggest cheese options.   This was a mild irritation made worse by the fact that when I asked the waitress about it earlier she had said, "It's in the menu" which, of course, if I had seen that, I would have ordered appropriately.  

Well anyhow, without expecting it, requesting it, or even actually wanting it, the bar manager did comp my burger. So, for that I guess we will be back at least once.  But we gotta get there during happy hour cause the drink prices are half-off then.

UPDATE: 8/22/13 As you can see from the comment from Leah below, it is this level of leadership commitment that will bring us back to the restaurant for another go.  I will post a brand new review once we do and update this one if our experience is better.
