I come from a family who were all born and raised in New Mexico. My standard for New Mexican food is extremely high. The rolled tacos were pretty good, the green salsa was on point, but the red chili with cumin lost me. It killed all the delicious natural flavor of red hatch chili. It also took forever to get helped.
