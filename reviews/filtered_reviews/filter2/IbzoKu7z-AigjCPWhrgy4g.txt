Food was good. Service was horrible. If it wasn't for the food quality it would not be a two star. They didn't have our reservation...,after arguing they magically did. They messed up all areas of our order. Had to repeat requests multiple times. Had to request attention on refills. Meal comes out and then they let one in my party know what had they ordered was not available. Then gave them the wrong order even after substitution- blamed them for touching the food that wasn't meant for them after delivered. Ridiculous event the whole way through. Going back to Michoacan. Never coming back here. They made us feel like the problem and when leaving was informed they were understaffed that day.
