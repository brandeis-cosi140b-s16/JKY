Oh, brother.  We live nearby and friends invited us to join them.  We had a reservation and did not have to wait on a Saturday evening.   The place was PACKED and SO LOUD we couldn't even carry on a conversation.   The prices are outrageous and the food average.  The drink prices are crazy-high as well.  We will never return.  There are SO many good Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas I really don't see why anyone would go here, but to each his own, as "they" say...
