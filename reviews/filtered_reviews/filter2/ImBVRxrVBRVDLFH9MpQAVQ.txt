With so many dining options in Las Vegas I am astounded this place is as busy as it is. Drinks were OK, nothing special. I ordered the ahi tuna and was extremely disappointed that it did not come as described on the menu. The menu stated it came with chipotle polenta but arrived with white rice. Server made no mention of the substitution and had I known, I would have ordered another dish. My boyfriend ordered the chicken fajitas and said they were terrible. Our other friends said their food was OK. Disappointed we wasted a meal here.
