Macayo's is serving up the most white-washed Mexican food I've ever tasted. Bleh. The food was entirely bland and lacked any distinguishing flavors. Let it be known that it was not my choice to eat here in the first place. (I blame you, husband, for feeding me mediocre food!). ;-)

CHIPS & SALSA: Chips were average but goodness gracious, that watered down salsa is the worst (to include store-bought) I've ever had. Zero flavor. It's basically red water. 1/5

CALIFORNIA BURRITO ($10.49): Way too much sour cream and forgettable in every way. Presentation was very boring as well. 1/5

BAJA BURRITO ($10.99): My husband said his "wasn't that bad" but agreed we would not be coming back. 3/5

SERVICE: Our waiter was the one bright spot on our visit. He kept up on refills and cleared up plates quick like. He also got our check ASAP when asked. Food was out in a jiffy and we were seated right when we walked in. 4/5

ATMOSPHERE: Kind of sad and nothing special. Decor is drab and the layout is weird. They tried to seat us in this domed auditorium area with A/C fans blasting on us at first. Nope, not happening. We moved to a different section and were much happier. 2/5

Return Visit?
Yeah, um no. Macayo's needs to make REAL salsa and step up the flavor in their dishes!
