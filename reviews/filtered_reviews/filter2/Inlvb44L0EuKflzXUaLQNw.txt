I was excited to try this place after living in the area for a few months, but I was unfortunately left disappointed. 

The pros: friendly staff, flavorful salsas (ask to try the habanero sauce!) and the queso was delish. 

The cons: the burrito was incredibly bland. It seemed like most of it was rice and beans, which would be ok if they had actually put the time into seasoning those components. The best part if the burrito was that I put salsa on it. Without that, it would've tasted of nothing.
