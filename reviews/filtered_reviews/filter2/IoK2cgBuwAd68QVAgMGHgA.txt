I was working at the Hard Rock Hotel for five days and ended up eating at almost every establishment there.

The service at Pink Taco was terrible! I was placing an order for take out and the girl at the counter was so rude. She acted as though I was really bothering her and that I was stupid. This is completely unacceptable.

The food at Pink Taco was alright. Not terrible, not that good either. I had the Baja Fish tacos. The plate included three street sized tacos, rice, and beans.

The tacos tasted fine, but the fish inside was measly. Also, the texture on one was totally overcooked and tough.

If you can, skip this place. There are better options at Hard Rock (e.g. Culinary Dropout, Nobu) and much much better options at other hotels.
