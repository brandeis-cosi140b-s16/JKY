Definitely not the sort of Mexican restaurant I was expecting. 

* we ordered mild guacamole. It tasted strangely sweet... Sweet guac??? Ew. 
* On the flip side, whatever sauce was on the enchiladas were RIDICULOUSLY spicy. Like, can't even enjoy my food spicy. I had two bites & then just asked for it to be put in a doggie bag. 
* server was... Impatient? Rude? In some sort of hurry to get us out of there, which is surprising since we were the only ones on the patio. 
* food portions were small for the price. 
* the salsa served with our chips was so watery. I like my salsa chunky. 

On a more positive note, the restaurant was spacious & it was a nice atmosphere. Oh & the chocolate brownie was good. 

Most likely won't be going back. There are better restaurants within the area.
