Mucho Macho Sucko. 

This trendy taco shop doesn't try too hard to feel authentic, nor does it insult your intelligence by pretending to be trendy and upscale while charging 2x what anyone with a triple-digit IQ would pay for a taco. It's got a real stoner, SoCal vibe to it, as though it were partially modeled after Wahoo's. 

I will be straightforward and join the other 20 or so negative reviews that indicate this place has a major seasoning issue. For real, the carne asada here is some of the most flavorless I've had anywhere, ever. I decided on the "macho burrito", what I assume to be their signature item. It had asada, tater tots, green chili, and...mayonnaise. Texture was definitely interesting, but literally the only source of flavor was the chili, which was severely lacking. Let's save the mayo for seafood tacos next time. :-/ 

As for the shrimp tacos, they were well-dressed with some refreshing toppings, but the shrimp tasted as though there was zero effort put into them. Like...you could at least cook this with some pepper, please. 

On the bright side, the horchata was great! 5/5, would drink again. 

What troubles me most is how the owner has such a cult following. Despite jeopardizing one of the most critically acclaimed lunch spots on Yelp, absolutely failing to fill the shoes of Gallo Blanco and, when left to his own devices, squanders his alleged talent on tired themes suited for tourist beaches, he is somehow the most well-known purveyor of Mexican food in Phoenix.  It's not fair. 

That being said, I won't totally disregard returning to this place, as they've got some unique items. Ideally, I'd love to have flavorful Mexican and American favorites in the same place. Unfortunately, Mucho Macho messed up some of the fundamentals, and I'm not so sure it should have come as a surprise.
