The food is awful. If you haven't tried real mexican food you may like it, otherwise you will be disappointed as I was.
The place seems to have a good atmosphere but then you will realize that it is as any other restaurant.
The worst was Chicharron de Queso and the Bloody Mary. The ingredients were not fresh.
We waited like an hour to get a table inside on Sunday afternoon. Then, the hostess asked us to accept the table outside, otherwise we should wait more time.
