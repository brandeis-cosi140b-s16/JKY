I've been here before but this is the first time I'm yelping about a recent dining experience (last night).

It was late and we just wanted a bite to eat and since we happened to be at Luxor picking up tickets for a show for a friend .... T&T was convenient.

Service: Slow and seemed like we were putting him out.  He didn't write down our order and had to repeat it to us 4 times coming back twice to verify.  All we ordered was veggie tacos and the combo tostado app.  It's not like it was complicated.

Food: Chips and Salsa were awesome. 
Combo tostado was good and the right size for just wanting something small to eat.  The veggie taco plate was good... but the beans and rice were cold when they were served.  Tacos are small so if you're super hungry you won't get filled up on them.  But if you just need something small, these are perfect sized.

Didn't have Margaritas this time but in the past they have been fantastic.

Overall.... if I'm going here again.... I'm having the Margaritas and chips and salsa.
