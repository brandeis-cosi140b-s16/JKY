Los Compadres has pretty good food. However, the customer service is seriously lacking! When I called in an order to pick up my lunch today - the lady I spoke with was very short and unfriendly. I ordered a Carne Asada burrito and some chips and salsa. I told her specifically I did NOT want beans and rice - She responded with "Okay".
When I arrived (not greeted/welcomed) and received my food, it was more expensive than the menu lead me to believe. I mentioned it to her after she took my card (in a hurry) and she told me it's because I ordered rice and beans. I was instantly irritated and said calmly that I told her over the phone I did not want B&R. She didn't seem to care, and responded with "Oh, I didn't hear you say that" She also told me that my Chips & Salsa were in the bag - I should have checked!

I just decided to take the hit and go. When I got to work and opened the bag, there were no chips. I thought about calling. However, since I said something earlier about being charged for something I DID NOT order and she didn't offer a refund or anything else. I decided it was pointless to call.
I will not be returning to or recommending this restaurant.
