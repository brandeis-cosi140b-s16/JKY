Music way too loud, had to yell at my server and my friend sitting right next to me, but food was amazing. People watching is always fun too, sat in the outside patio overlooking bellagio fountains and lots of people walking on the street. Very high traffic spot. In the middle of all the action. Margaritas were watered down.. Overall not bad, but far from an intimate setting.  This atmosphere reminded me of a club.
