We were visiting family in AZ and it seems that this is everybody's favorite meeting spot for dinner and drinks in the area. Sure enough, the place looks super busy, with friendly service and a solicitous hostess. We sat on the patio and admired the world going by, had good conversation going and ordered some drinks. The margarita special was served in tall water glasses, filled to the brim with ice and very light on the tequila - at least to my East Coast palate (I've had drinks in TX, CA and Mexico that put everything else to shame, so...). Chips and salsa appeared quickly and they are nothing special, but okay. Now to the food. It is in one word terrible! This is not Southwestern Mex, Tex or any kind of Mex, it is just awful! The Shrimp Tequila Ceviche had canned Thai mini-shrimp in it, and was watered down a lot. I had no time to finish it since the main dishes came out practically 2 minutes later. On the advice of several family members I ordered the Chile Rellenos and another of us visitors ordered one of Kelli's combos, I think it had the green corn something or other. Okay, those chiles were flat, flat, flat, were swimming in grease, had a thick blanket of cheese on them and had probably spent some time in the microwave and under the lamps. The refried beans looked like they had been diluted with water and whizzed in a blender and the rice was close to inedible. The green corn tamales were nothing to write home about. Only the steak fajitas were somewhat palatable. Our local family appeared to be faithful patrons, so we kept mum, but I doubt that this restaurant would warrant a return visit unless they get their act together in terms of expediting the food properly, not watering down drinks and definitely in the food quality sector.
