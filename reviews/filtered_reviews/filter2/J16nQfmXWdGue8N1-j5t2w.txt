After the original cafe we had scheduled our book club at was closed, we decided to do brunch at Z'Tejas. The brunch options were kind of blah. I wanted to get peanut butter (or Jam) for my english muffin, but they didn't have any. I thought I'd try the french toast but didn't when they let me know that they didn't have syrup. 

There are so many AMAZING breakfast and brunch spots in AZ, there really is no reason at all to go to Z Tejas for brunch. Maybe they should stick to lunch and dinner.
