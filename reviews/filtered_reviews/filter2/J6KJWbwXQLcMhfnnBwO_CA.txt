Well just having spent the past weekend at the valley Ho, it was interesting to compare the two hotel concepts and restaurants . Both being old outdated hotels remodeled into somewhat trendy urban hot spots. I walked into the lobby and was pleasantly surprised by the decor. Artsy in a "raw" sort of way. Exposed ceilings, cheap local art for purchase on the walls, a view of the really cool pool area, then walked into the "gallo blanco". I was 1 of 2 people there. I sat at the bar
I sat down and scanned the menu that was on the chalkborarded walls. The server handed me a wine list. I had vino blanco from Argentina. It was ice cold and served in what appeared to be a Riedel "o" glassware.I  Liked this. Things are going well at this point. Then I ordered just one Fish Taco. I wasn't real hunger so this small taco was the perfect size. It was served on a small corn tortilla, the fish was halibut and it was nicely grilled. If I ordered it again I would have them hold the white sauce that tasted like "miracle whip"?? the fish was so fresh, it would have been perfect with just the avocado, and lettuce. Conversation was going fine with the server unitl for some reason he asked my age, which I thought was odd. then from there the conversation digressed into some political and philosophical debate?? I was just looking to unwind with some vino and food and to relax. I guess I may give Gallo Blanco  another shot to try some other things on the menu, but I would probably bring a friend along next time, and avoid the politics :)
