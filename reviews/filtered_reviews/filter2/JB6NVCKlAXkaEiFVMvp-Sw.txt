Went for lunch the other day because I had a coupon and I love Mexican food, so I was excited to give it a try. I have to say, I was disappointed. I had the shredded beef chimichanga- it was so-so. I've definitely had a more flavorful chimichanga at a cheaper price elsewhere. I was also not impressed by the service. Our waiter never came to check on us, other than taking our order and bringing the food, which meant we had empty water glasses most of the time. Not cool. But on the plus side, they have a killer bean dip. I'd go back just to eat the chips and bean dip, but probably sit in the bar for (hopefully) better service.
