Searching for a lunch option after a hard shop at Costco we deiced to check this place since it was just around the corner. This place is a little bit dirty, the first table we were sat at was covered in ants.. we told the waiter and he shrugged and I asked if we wanted to move?! Hello?! No I want to sit with the ants.. maybe they will like some chips and salsa also? Dipshit. 

Anyway, the service and kitchen were pretty quick. Ordered a cheese crisp which was actually really good.. super crispy, melty cheesy goodness.. the Mr ordered a Grilled Chicken Ceasar Salad.. Im like WTF?! I ordered the pollo chicken something.. you know the one with the deep fried chicken burrito smothered in cheddar cheese and cream cheese.. it was pretty good I suppose but the rice was so dry I thought it was uncooked.. the Mr's Salad was WAY over dressed.. well duh!

All in all this was place was just so so.. the ants were a real turn off.. for this style of Mexican Id say that there are other places who do it better and cheaper. 

I wonder how those ants would have tasted deep fried?
