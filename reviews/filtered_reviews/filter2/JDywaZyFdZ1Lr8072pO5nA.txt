Just wanted to get my pre-game on and grab some drinks after picking someone up from the airport so we came here... seemed okay at first, then it went downhill after our server started talking.

Not that he was rude or anything, he looked like he came into work hungover and he really didn't seem to know what he was doing anyway. I asked him for some hefeweizen and he told me he didn't know what that was. Chips and salsa weren't that great either. Uh...next.
