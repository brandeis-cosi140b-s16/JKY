Met friends for dinner last night as had been interested in trying one of the Barrio restaurants for quite awhile. The restaurant has a nicely shaded patio which was great to be able to sit outside in June! Really enjoyed the guacamole made table side as it had the cranberries that really gave it a twist!

Servicewise?? Beers took forever to get to the table and once delivered, were incorrect. The patio misters were on full blast and by the time we left, the back of my shirt  and my head was soaked with water. I have never blow dried my head at a restaurant before but cant say that now! Several tables made mention of the heavy mist that was to go off at 8p but we were still in a London fog a 815pm.

The chicken burrito was good but I rushed through it so I could leave and dry off. Guess we should have changed tables and moved inside but not all of us were getting the free shower and that was never offered to us.
