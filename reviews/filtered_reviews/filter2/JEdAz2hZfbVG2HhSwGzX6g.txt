Came here with my wife for a casual, low-key dinner...

Pros:  Service was excellent, our waiter was a super nice guy and made sure we were taken care of during our dining experience.  Wish more waiters were like him....The restaurant also has a sizable bar and outdoor seating available.  Located in a shopping plaza with plenty of parking.

Cons:  Food was OK.  I ordered the chimichanga and wife got the burrito rice bowl along with spinach queso dip.  The salsa for the chip was far below average, almost like a thickened ketchup.  I wish I had more  positive things to say about the food.  

Disappointed with the food and cannot recommend as a place to go.
