Went to ztejas today for lunch. The server was great, I got the happy hour margarita, which are super strong and always delish. Then I ordered the salmon miso with rice and veggies. It was a $19 plate. I asked for the salmon medium rare. As I was eating it I got to the thicker part and it was pretty much uncooked. It wasn't even warm in the middle. Told the waiter and he took the plate back to fix it. When it came back it was my exact same plate with my partial bites in the same place, conclusion they popped it in the microwave! I sucked it up and ate it to realize the rice was hard as well! Awful. When we finished the manager came by to ask how it was. I let him know my salmon was way undercooked and the rice was hard! He said sorry and that he would let the kitchen know. Didn't offer reduced check, dessert or anything. Besides the marg and cornbread it was awful and I can't believe I spent 30 dollars here today. Never going back.
