Really great atmosphere. Sub par food. Excellent service. Typical Vegas prices. 

The boyfriend was hungover and we were having a late lunch with some friends. Chile Verde, Shrimp Quesadilla, Carne Asada Quesadilla, and ceviche. The boyfriend also ordered a bloody mary, it was disgusting so we sent it back and ordered a shot of tequila instead. 

Chile Verde, was passable. No thanks, two bites and we called it quits. The Carne Asada quesadilla was oily but I suppose perfect for the hangover he was nursing. The Shrimp Quesadilla was probably the only thing that we would order again. It was a decent enough size for the price. Lastly, the ceviche, eh. I'm from California, and I've had street ceviche that tasted much better. 

Also, they do not have fountain sodas, so be prepared to pay 5 bucks for a bottled soda. 

I understand that this is not the only location of Javier's and because the atmosphere was so nice, and the waitstaff super attentive, I would be willing to try this place again. Obviously, we were in Vegas so we weren't too upset about the prices, but if you're looking for quality food in Vegas, I'd pass on Javier's.
