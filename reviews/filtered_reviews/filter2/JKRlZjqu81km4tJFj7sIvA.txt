A rare yelp disappointment!  Just a touch about Filiberto's and that's a very generous compliment.  

I ordered the two carne asada burrito combo with rice and beans.  The rice was bland and room temperature as was the beans.  My wife chewed on something that definitely wasn't carne asada and had to spit it out.  My carne asada was rubbery and just average at best. Everything about this place was a disappointment, even the prices which I thought were actually high for a hole-in-the-wall that you have to look hard to find.  

Do yourself a favor and get a carne asada somewhere else.
