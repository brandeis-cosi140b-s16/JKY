Went in for lunch and the place was quiet. Ordered two of their specialty margaritas. 1 was great and the other was not for me. Thought for $10 a drink they'd be a little more impressive in size and flavor. Server was friendly and spent the right amount of time with my friend and I. Ordered a light lunch and opted for the bowl of the Posole. Mmm! Lightly spiced but full of smoked chicken and hominy. Chips and salsa were tasty as well.
