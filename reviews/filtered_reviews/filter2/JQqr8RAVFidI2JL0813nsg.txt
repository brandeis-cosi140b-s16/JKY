Visited Juan's after reading the numerous complementary reviews. Unfortunately, our experience did not come close to that of more enthusiastic reviewers. The service left something to be desired, primarily because we had to wait over thirty minutes for our food to arrive, even though the restaurant was not packed until after we received our food. Additionally, I was not impressed by the tamale on my plate and found the cheese enchilada cold. My husband was also less than impressed by his chile relleno, but found it more edible than my food. Overall, we have had much better Mexican food at numerous other establishments in the Phoenix area and will not be returning.
