Like many other reviewers, we tried Padre's because of a Groupon. 

Wait staff was competent, and our drinks stayed mostly full.

We had the calamari as an appetizer: very overpriced at $10.95, I liked the flavor (its got a little chili mixed in with the breading). I like one of the three dipping sauces, and my wife liked a different one. When the waitress asked if we liked it, my wife indicated it was greasy and chewy. She apologized, but not really convincingly.

For entrees, I had the garlic shrimp tacos and my wife had the "Tia's Enchiladas" with spinach and cheese. My tacos were 3 small tacos with a decent amount of shrimp, cilantro, lettuce, and a pineapple salsa. They weren't bad, but were not very garlicy. My wife's enchiladas were good, nothing special. The ever-present sides of refried beans were typical of the variety, and the rice was well done with good flavor. Contrary to some other reviews, I would have called the plate sizes ordinary and not "huge".

For desert, my wife and I were going to split the banana epanadas with brandy caramel, but asked for it to be served without the brandy, as my wife has a severe alcohol allergy. The server checked with the manager and said they could do it, but that the caramel would lose a lot of its flavor without the brandy, and said it all burned off in the cooking. Well, from experience, my wife and I know it isn't true (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions#Food_and_cooking), so we asked for it anyway.

Then the server went to place the order and the cooks said the brandy was pre-mixed with the caramel. We cancelled the desert order. It was a bit frustrating that the manager didn't know how the dishes were prepped in the kitchen.
 
Overall, it was typical mexican food with a "modern" take (apparently if you put pineapple salsa on shrimp tacos and a fancy swirl of sauce on the enchiladas its "modern") -- personally, there are much better Mexican restaurants in town.
