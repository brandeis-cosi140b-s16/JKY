We have been trying to branch out lately. I've really been into fish tacos so we thought we'd give them a try. 
When we walked in it took a little to be noticed. I'm used to being greeted right away and "I'll be with you" but that didn't happen. When we were greeted, they said to sit anywhere. 
Someone then brought us menus, and plastic forks. The plastic forks were placed right on top of the menu with no napkins.... That seemed unsanitary and really turned off my husband. 
We got the crab cakes and the beer battered mahi tacos. It states on the menu that you get beans and rice for sides. 
We waited a little but they were pretty busy so the wait was what was expected. When we got our food, we were both surprised by how tiny the sides were for the tacos! It was in a small cup the size of the cups you put ketchup or mustard in! 
Our waitress said she would bring us napkins, and never did. Again, it was busy... But still.
The crab cakes were good. Not anything special. The tarter sauce that came with it tasted like ranch dressing. Again nothing special. 
The fish tacos were bigger then most I've seen. They had an odd taste though. We think it may be the cheese they choose. 
At the end when we got our check and saw that for the small amount of food we got cost $20, we both decided we will not be going back based on the price for the quality and portion size.
