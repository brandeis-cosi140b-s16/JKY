just had lunch here today and boy this is a sad excuse for Mexican restaurant.  in fact it really fails on both fronts..no real mexican flavors and the service is earnest at times but overall weak..big green pond big deal, who cares!! It is an old and tired spot that does have really good chips and salsa..it's a long way to drive for way average food and bad service
