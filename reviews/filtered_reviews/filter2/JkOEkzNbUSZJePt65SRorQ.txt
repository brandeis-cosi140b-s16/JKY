I went here with much optimism because of the great reviews on here. But when I walked it, it was nothing of what I expected. My sister and I were craving some shrimp tacos, so we went to the taco line. It was very disorganized for the amount of people in there. I like the idea of the street taco, but maybe they should have made a longer buffet line. After waiting for about 10 minutes before we could be helped (even though several employees were standing around and talking), they said the shrimp would be another 2 minutes, and that we should sit down. That turned into 15 minutes, and we decided to get some chips and pico de gallo. My sister and I went up to see if they were done, and to our dismay everything that we wanted on the tacos were wrong. They put cheese on shrimp tacos, and being the foodie I am that is a big no no. We decided to ignore it and went to pay. The whole thing cost $15! That isn't a bad price, but on the menu tacos cost around $4 and we got two orders... So chips and pico de gallo cost $7?! Anyway the food was mediocre, but not good enough to come back again.
