Went to Cabo Wabo tonight for a Vegas Young Professionals event, at first I thought I was in the wrong place because hidden far in the miracle mile shops it can be a bit confusing. The outside looks like any other "frozen" bar you would encounter on the strip. I walked up to the hostess stand and asked "where is the restaurant" she pointed down a long hallway. 

The restaurant itself is pretty small but it does have two levels. The second level seems to be a banquet/rental area and this is where our event was held. I had a margarita and while it was decent it was way too sweet and syrup-y for my tastes. A friend ordered a vodka soda and we were both shocked to find out the tiny little 8oz cup w/one shot costs $14!!! I have paid less at a nightclub! That's where the place lost two stars, I understand you're a strip bar but come on! $10 would even be an insult. 

I tried a piece of pizza and some taquitos, they were pretty good but I didn't sample the actual menu. The music was way too loud for a networking event or even sitting down to dinner. Overall this place has potential if they lower their prices.
