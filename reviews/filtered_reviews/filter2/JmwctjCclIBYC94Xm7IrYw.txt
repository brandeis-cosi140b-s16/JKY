I recently went to La Santisma when I saw that their Pacific White Fish taco was on the list of "Top 100 Dishes to try in Phoenix". This taco was one of the worat tacos I have ever tried. The fish was covered in a thick beer batter and was so dark and smelled awful. I should have known better when the server said she'd never tried it because "she's very picky about her fish". We also tried their Gaucho quesdadilla based on a suggestion from the server. The quesadilla tasted like a deep fried blob of cheese with some pieces of steak.  The strawberry salsa from the salsa bar was the only thing that made the quesadilla palatable. The salsa bar should be labeled by spiciness. There are tons of options, but most of the salsa is so spicy, that you couldn't taste anything else (I imagine that whoever said the fish taco was a "top 100 dish" smothered the fish in a salsa that made tasting the actual fish impossible).  The horchata was very good with fresh fruit and nuts, hence the 2 star rating.
