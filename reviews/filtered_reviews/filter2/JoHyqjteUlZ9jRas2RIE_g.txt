It's too bad with so few good Mexican restaurants, what passes for good now is just very ordinary. The food at Lindo is plentiful on the plate and not outrageously priced... it's just that it does not make you say, I must return here. 
For folks in Henderson, it's a long trip up to the World Market Center, but that's where you'll find interesting and very creative Mexican fare... at  Mundo Restaurant. ..(moving from their previous location over on Ft Apache, wish they decided to come to Henderson instead).
