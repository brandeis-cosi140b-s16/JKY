This place was ehhh...not impressed. The campechana was really small for 15.00.  The oysters were very small and dirrty. They didn't taste fresh either. 3 Carne Asada tacos plate has no flavor and it really didn't look like Carne Asada either. 
I don't get all these 4-5 star reviews.  The only thing good there was the waitress, who was attentive. 
Disappointed.
