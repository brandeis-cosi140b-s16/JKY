It was our first time at sandbar, me and a friend got the jalepeno mac n cheese. And my boyfriend got the calamari. The jalepeno mac was missing the cheese and jalepeno...it was tateless. And my bf had a hair in his calamari! The waitress we had seemed to have an attitude, and when I told her it was our first time here she didn't even explain the menu. I don't think she even introduced herself. The only reason I gave this place two stars is because the manager was very sweet and gave my bf a new plate of calamari and took it off our bill. She was very apologetic! Other than that, my experience was not great and I would rate it less.
