This place is a bit overrated, sorry folks!  Do they have an awesome DJ nightly that keeps people having fun?  Yes!  Do they make awesomely inappropriate balloon hats for patrons?  Yes!  Is there food INCREDIBLY over-priced?  YES!!!  $17.00 for a very regular cheeseburger and fries is a bit out of line.  Go for the atmosphere and possibly a drink, skip dinner!

They have a Groupon right now, need I say more?
