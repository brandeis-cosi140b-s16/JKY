We really wanted to love it here.  We loved the Satisfied Frog and were sad to see it go.  When we heard this was a local guy, we especially wanted to love it.  

The cheese appetizer, the salsa (yum!) and the hamburgers are all pretty good.  The rest, not so much.  

We invited some friends to join us for lunch and burgers and ribs.  The ribs were stuck to the bone, chewy and just not very flavorful.  Another friend had lamb and said it was OK.  The beef/veggie wrap was not bad.  

The staff is very young, but they're enthusiastic and want to please.  I don't mind the misspelling on the menu - it makes it more "home-grown" somehow.  The owner came out both times we visited to talk to us about the dishes.  We just didn't have the heart to tell him they really weren't great.
