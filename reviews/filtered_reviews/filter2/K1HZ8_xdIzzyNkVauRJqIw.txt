We dropped in for dinner; excellent service.  The mojito was also very good - left me wanting another!   

BUT DH didn't enjoy his Kobe burger - the ciabatta bun was too dense to enjoy the tender beef...   They don't yet have a kids' menu, and the burrito we "special ordered" for our son didn't live up to expectations - we asked for guacamole and sour cream (among other things) and it contained neither.  Bah!  Also, I'm told there was an "inappropriate" picture in the men's room, if you're planning to take your kids to the toilet. 

Overall a disappointing visit - almost entirely due to problems w/ the food.  Not good if you're in the business of feeding people!
