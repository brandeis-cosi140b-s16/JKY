Well, 
All we have heard is nothing but good things about this place. The only reason we tried it because Garcia's is much further away! Looking at their menu it really looked like they specialize in spinach, and looks like they have some other food that other restaurants do not offer. I just had a simple carnitas? Not to hard to screw it up, but they did. Seem like they over did the marinating! The beans were good, their spanish rice tasted like rice pilaf? Place just doesn't do it for us.
