I have coworkers who swear by this place but I honestly cannot stand it. I thought that something was wrong with me and I wasn't giving it a fair chance, so I went with them at least six or seven times. Not a fan.

I am a vegetarian and it's not their fault that I have a limited selection, but the selections I have chosen just weren't up to par. The tostada special on Wednesday is just not impressive at all, though my coworkers love it. I think both sauces they offer are disgusting and the overall taste is just...bleh. So I decided to try the cheese quesadilla two times.....bleh. It was undercooked and greasy! 

Lastly, the place is just too damn loud! The employees are always yelling something when someone orders extra this or extra that. I can barely participate in the conversations my coworkers are having because I can't hear over the noise.

Don't get me wrong, they must be doing something right, because that place is always jam packed when we come in during lunch hour and my coworkers LOVE it! It's just not my bag. The food isn't as good as people say it is. I'd rather go to Qdoba, in which I find is it's closest comparison. Can't compare to Chipotle nor Zabas as I find they are way different as far as taste and selection. Bon apetite!
