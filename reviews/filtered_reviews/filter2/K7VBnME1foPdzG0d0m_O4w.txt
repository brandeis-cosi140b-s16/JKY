I am a true taco fanatic!  Born and raised in AZ, your going to eat Mexican food.  I'm always searching for a good taco.  Visited backyard taco about a week ago because of the reviews on Yelp.  Lucky for me I went on a Tuesday AFTER 2 pm to get the $1.25 tacos.  First, the taco's are VERY SMALL and on my visit the carna sada meet was a little salty.  Nevertheless, they were ok.  I decided that I wanted to return to try the Crazy potatoe.  Today, I visit again and this time I ordered the Crazy potatoe and a chicken quesadilla.  Although the crazy potatoe was ok, it is not worth the $6.00 that they charge you for it.  The chicken quesadilla was AWFUL.  By the time I made it back to work (10 minute drive) the tortilla was soggy, there was fat in the chicken and I just threw it away.  I will NOT be returning to this establishment.  Too too too expensive for the quality of food given out.  It seems to stay packed, but I honestly do not know why?  Maybe there isn't anything else just as good in the area.  Don't know!
