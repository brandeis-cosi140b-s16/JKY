Chips and salsa were really good. Especially for $3. $4 more dollars to add the guac! I didn't add the guac. I got 2 tacos. One carne asada and one shrimp. There were 3 shrimp that were on the taco butterflied to lool like 6. It was ok tasting... Kinda burnt tasting. The carne asada taco would have been good but that too was burnt tasting. Probably won't eat here again. Also note: no Budwiser products for a Mexican Restaurant!!!
