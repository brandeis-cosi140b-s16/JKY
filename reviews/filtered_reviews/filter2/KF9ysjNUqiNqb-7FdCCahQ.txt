This is the third time I've eaten here, and I'm sorry to say, but they really flubbed it this time.
PLUS: Portions are generous.  Chips and salsa as soon as you sit down are really tasty.  Service is solid.  Prices reasonable.  Food is tasty.
MINUS: Way too salty.  Everything except the salad had far more salt than necessary or even reasonable.  Music was too loud for the few other diners and was some terrible mix that had nothing to do with the Tex/Mex theme that was so carefully planned everywhere throughout the entire restaurant.  And final problem was probably just bad luck, but the chili rubbed sirloin, while fantastically yummy to taste, was the most gristly piece of meat I've ever been served anywhere (including the IHOP).  Also managed to deliver an almost well-done dish when I had asked for medium-rare.  Would have given 3-4 stars if more appropriate music and volume, less salt, and properly prepared steak.
