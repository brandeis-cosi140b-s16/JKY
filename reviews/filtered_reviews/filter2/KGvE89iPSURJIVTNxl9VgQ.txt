I've been to this place a few times, I don't know why. There is much better Mexican in the Valley. It's kid friendly at least. Very noise and cramped sitting. The service was bad. I had to waive down the waiter to get our check so we could leave (he was talking to another employee and it did not look like he was talking about work related stuff). 

Food is OK. Ordered the enchilada and Beef Taco #3. The taco was crispy just how I like it. Enchilada was very bad and smothered with sauce and CHEESE, It was a shredded beef enchilada, it was more like a cheese enchilada, could not taste the beef at all. 

It was embarrassing, we were entertaining a guess from out of town (Hawaii) and she said she had better in Hawaii. You have to know there is not many places to eat Mexican in Hawaii. 

Kids did not enjoy their food either. 

Definitely will be my last visit.
