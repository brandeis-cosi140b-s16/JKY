The food was alright; I shared a shrimp cocktail and make-your-own taco plate with my boyfriend.
And the waitress didn't provide ME with any good service; she rather took a liking to my boyfriend. Only talked to him, only smiled at him, and tried to be all seductive. Too bad for her, I was the one paying. I'm sure if she gave ALL the customers present good service (cough cough) she would've made a better tip.
