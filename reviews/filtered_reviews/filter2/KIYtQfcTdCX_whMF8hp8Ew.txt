Wooooow. The yelp reviews weren't kidding. We went here during IMAZ, since we didn't want to stray too far from the finish. I understand being busy, but they had run out of both refried AND black beans, and seemed to be running out of lettuce, too. Our food took a long time to come out, and when it did, it was strewn on the plate, my friend's tortillas were literally refrigerated (just throw then on the grill, dudes!) and my other friend's taco had cheese on it, even though she asked for it without. 

The saving grace of the place were the drink specials... there's absolutely nothing wrong with $2 draft beers, especially when you have a good selection. And the mangorita was delicious. So, in conclusion, you can come here to drink, but my god, that food was not good. As my friend says, "this is what happens to taco joints when you run all your mexicans out of town."
