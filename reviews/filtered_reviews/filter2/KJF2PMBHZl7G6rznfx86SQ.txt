I really enjoy the ambiance and decor here. But that's about all I enjoyed during a big birthday dinner that I attended here....
The food was mediocre, and overpriced for what you get. The drinks were also quite expensive. I came here on a busy Friday night, and it was totally PACKED, which is probably a good sign, but I was overall very underwhelmed by the entire experience. I kinda prefer Roberto's Taco Shop food-wise :/

Okay, I lied. I did like our server. He was very friendly and had a great personality. But the service overall was VERY slow and inaccurate. He also made a huge deal out of trying to split the check...and in the end we just split it for him.
