We went to Z Tejas for dinner Saturday night after cocktails at the sandbar. We should've eaten at sandbar!! We don't live close to a tejas so we don't frequent the joint-- but we've had brunch several times and we're pleased. This dinner was low scale. It was like Olive Garden -- clearly pre-made and flavorless. I had chicken stuffed with spinach, mushrooms and se bland sauce And my hubby had the paper thin ribeye with bland sauce. The vegetables and potatoes looked the same on every plate (pet peeve). Boooo! Service was decent... That's why you got two stars. We won't return!
