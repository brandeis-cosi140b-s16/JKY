Ambiance was fantastic, even better was the Horchata Margarita!  However, I could not eat the food as it was so salty.  Why don't restaurants realize us baby boomers are a good portion of the people going out to dinner and we all try to keep our blood pressure down?  Carnitas Street Tacos were tasteless and the tortillas were dripping with steam table juice...  Never again!  Wait staff was excellent...
