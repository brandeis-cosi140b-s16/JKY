Good service, nice atmosphere, but below average food. Four of us in our group and we all agreed there was something off about their enchiladas. So maybe avoid that. Afterwards we all feel unsettled and have the "Mexican burps" .. The chips seemed over oily. The four of us won't be returning. (Mid 20's and we love Mexican)
