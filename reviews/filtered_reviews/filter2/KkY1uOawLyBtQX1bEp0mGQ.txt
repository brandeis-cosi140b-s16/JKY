Ordered the nachos and the veggie enchiladas, and 2 margaritas.  The beans on the nachos were incredibly salty - could not eat without drowning them in sour cream.  The dinner plate was loaded with so much cheese you could choke from it... unhealthy and fattening meal, and unfortunately the taste, quality of food, or flavor did not justify the calories.   The atmosphere is very nice, unfortunately the food made it such that I'll never return.  Service was good overall.  The manager walked over to ask us how we were doing, but didn't stay long enough to hear the answer.  Enjoyed the 80's alternative music.
