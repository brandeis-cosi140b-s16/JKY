The staff you currently have on Tuesday nights is lackluster at best.   I kept waiting to say something hoping it was just a fluke but unfortunately that is not the case. It just keeps repeating itself.  Example: The gal working at the register at 400PM yesterday acted as though customers were interrupting her.  She stood at the bar (customer side) talking to one of her departing co-workers (seated at bar) for several minutes.  This left an older woman standing at the counter with no one even acknowledging her.  A big order needed to be packed up and she just stood staring into outer space while the other gal pack up all the food.  It appears she couldn't even help put 1 lid on a bowl.   No teamwork in a place this small is apparent to all of the customers.  We ordered items that were forgotten and then given the "evil eye" when we stated we were  missing the item.  After waiting several more minutes I walked up to the counter and was asked "have you already placed an order" in a rude tone. Customer orders all come out at the same time regardless of when tplaced.  Example I got my order at the same time as a customer ordering 10 minutes later.  We have been loyal customers for quite sometime and sing your praises to all we can but don't know if I can continue to do that. This never happened when Eileen was there on Tuesday nights.  Perhaps you need to have a strong team leader on duty for Tuesday nights when I know it gets hectic.  As a member of the staff there please don't treat customers as though they are a nuisance and that you shouldn't have to be bothered.  
Thanks!
