We came here for a bday party and on a consistent level, the service was terrible. I guess we had a server AND a food runner because after being completely ignored for 20 mins we finally flagged down (we later found out) the food runner. She said she wasn't our waitress but would take our order. When we asked her opinion about the food she told us, "the food here sucks". So we just picked a cheese crisp. After waiting 15 minutes for the beer we ordered, we flagged down the server who said, "oh, don't order from her, she's just the food runner" WTH? It took forever to get any kind of service and everyone walks around there like they are lost. The only time we go there is if someone is having a party which is too bad because the concept is good but the food and service always sucks. Stop hiring the girls for their looks and get someone in there with a brain.
