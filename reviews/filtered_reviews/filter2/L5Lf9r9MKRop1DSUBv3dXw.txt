Came to Los Reyes de las tortas because of all the good reviews, but I was kind of disappointed. Te place was clean an it was full but they REALLY need more servers service was very slow and the food came one plate at a time. We had the "del Rey" torta because of how famous it is but it OVER RATED! It was bland and super greasy. The queso fundido and the aguas frescas were the BEST thing very good !!! Tacos NOT good at all and the refried beans I won't even go there. But they do serve a LOT of food for the price!
