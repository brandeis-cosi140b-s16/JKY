Experienced  A LOT better.  We decided to try it.  Rosa's, or Mango's are 100000 times better.  In regards to flavor.   

The building is nice, but it does not make bland food.  

If you want amazing Mexican food go to Rosa's or Mango's.  Skip the mainstream Mexican food and go to local "mom and pop" restaurants.
