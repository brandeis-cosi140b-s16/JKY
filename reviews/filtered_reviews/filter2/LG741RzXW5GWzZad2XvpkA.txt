The food was good but service was awful. We walk in and were ignored by 2 employees all while the restaurant was filled with one table. Yes, one table with a family of 6. If they can't even greet a customer when they have one table, I can't imagine what it's like when they're actually busy. 

The atmosphere was also extremely weird from the moment you walk in the door. It was 6pm on a weekday and they had the music bumping, lights down, and strobe/laser lights going. Didn't know if I was in a restaurant or club. I usually don't care too much about atmosphere as long as it's clean and service/food is good but this place just bothered me. It's also tucked away in a really ghetto shopping center where the Parking lot is filled with the local mini mart's sketchy shoppers. I honestly didn't feel safe and I've been to all kinds of places in not to so good parts of town. 

So, the food... It was descent. Wouldn't say it was exceptional. Honestly the service and atmosphere ruined the meal. The dumplings were bland and oily. The chicken schnitzel was okay and the potatoes were okay as well. 

Honestly, I won't be going back though I don't live far from here.
