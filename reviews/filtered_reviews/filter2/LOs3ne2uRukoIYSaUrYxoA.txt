I should have read the yelp warnings. The chips were pieces and the salsa was runny and not very flavorful. I had the small chimichanga with a side of rice. The plate came out burning hot, but the rice was luke warm. The chimichanga was good maybe a little more cheese. Very pricey for the mediocre food. Four meals for $80 with the tip. We won't be back.
