Although they provide great service, I have always thought this place is overrated. I tried it a second time a couple of weeks ago to give it another chance. My first experience with their food left me questioning how they can get away with these outrageously high prices and the food being just average. 

This time around we opted out of ordering tacos as I get way better tacos at Tacos El Gordo for half the price. I was craving soup so we ordered posole as a starter as well as chips & salsa, chicken flautas, 20 vegetable fried rice, and dan dan noodles. The posole was salty and the soup thick. I had to ask for more lime to offset the saltiness. The vegetable fried rice is good but not at $19. 

I don't think I can see myself coming back unless there is nothing else available if I'm staying at the Cosmopolitan.
