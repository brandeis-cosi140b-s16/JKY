We went here on a Friday night, hearing from someone that it has great authentic Mexican food AND seeing in New Times that they received Best Margarita in Phoenix 2011... Um, No. Yelpers are totally right when they say the service isn't very good. This location is very small and we waited at least an hour for the two of us. If the food was outstanding, then it wouldn't really matter, but that's a big if. The green corn tamale was so utterly spicey I couldn't even taste it. The beef taco was boring. It was a just a plain crispy taco shell like you'd get at Taco Bell! I expected a Filibertos style taco shell, mmm. Most importantly, and most disappointing, was the margarita! New Times was bought off to put this place as the best margarita in Phoenix. It totally sucked! Strong, but bad. I can think of four places off the top of my head with the best margaritas: Z Tejas, Sidebar, Four Peaks, and La Grande Orange Pizzaria. I give the place 2 stars cause the rice was good and for people who love spicey food, this place would probably be satisfying.
