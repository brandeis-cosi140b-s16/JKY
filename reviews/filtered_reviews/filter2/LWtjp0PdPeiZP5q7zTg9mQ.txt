I don't really know what the big hype is. I've had better Mexican food- and their portion sizes are just ridiculously small for what you pay. Bowl was about $6 and filled barely half of the plate (w/ a tiny scoop of rice). The Mexican corn was basically corn sitting in lukewarm water, lathered w/ margarine and sprinkled w/ parm and chili powder on it. NOT worth it. 
The 2nd time I went for just tacos (Al pastor) and they were decent but definitely not worth the price of 2.25/taco. It's a taco stand disguised as a "nice sit down restaurant" which it isn't.
