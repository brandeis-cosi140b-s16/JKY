Saw a bunch of reviews of Yayo Taco, both good and bad, and decided to stop in and and experience this place for myself.  There are student specials there and being that me and my fiance are students, we took advantage of the deals.  I also heard from a few friends that the vegetarian/vegan tacos were pretty good and decided to try those as well.  The cashier (who also doubled as the owner/manager?) had really dry humor and pined himself on being a smart-ass, which I really didn't mind too much at first.  After placing our order, we sat down and waited for our food.  The food took a little over 20 minutes to come out so luckily I wasn't too hungry haha!  The regular tacos (I had vegetarian ones and a fish one as well) were actually pretty good but the vegan taco I has was less than alright (I tried the 'adobo' vegan taco to be specific..just didn't taste right).  The smart-ass manager kept pestering us while we ate as well and started using obscenities to supplement his sarcasm.  Now, had I been by myself, I wouldn't have minded it too much and probably would have joined in on the sarcasm.  But, he started cursing at my fiance and told her to "sit your ass down and stop f&*%ing moving around damnit" when she went to switch seats on our table to get out of the sunlight.  What's up with that?  Sure we're students, but jesting us with condescending quips all night isn't really what we wanted to hear especially when we we nowhere near rude or sarcastic.  Definitely didn't appreciate the vulgarities and talking that way probably is the reason why there was no one there (on a friday night nonetheless).  The food was pretty good and I appreciated the student special, but being told 'F%$k you' all night long, even if it was a stale attempt at humor, definitely weaned away my chances from returning to eat there again.   2 stars for the good food and the less-than-welcoming attitude.
