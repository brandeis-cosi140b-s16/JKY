I moved to Pittsburgh from the Southwest and have not yet found any decent Mexican food. While I was wary of Mad Mex due to reading reviews, some coworkers insisted that I try it anyway and spoke highly of it, so I did. We ordered nachos and a carnitas burrito. The nachos were just not made well, structurally speaking. They were big and had lots of toppings, but the cheese wasn't distributed evenly at all, and wasn't a nice melty cheese sauce. It was also overcooked so it was just kind of like dried cheese on some chips with lots of cheese-less chips. The other toppings were okay but nothing amazing. The burrito was really sad. It looked like a square on the plate, not like any burrito I've ever seen before. The filling was almost entirely rice, which was okay tasting by itself, but there was way too much in the burrito. The carnitas were extremely salty to the point that I didn't even finish the meat. There were a few trace amounts of green in the bottom of the tortilla (I guess that was the advertised "green chile"), but they had almost no flavor or spice so it was hard to distinguish them. On the side was a flavorless pico de gallo and slaw, and some cornbread that was really mushy in the middle (undercooked). Overall, not impressed and not going back unless it's just for drinks.
