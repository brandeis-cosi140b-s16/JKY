Now, I'm going to give this restaurant a poor review not because of the food (because we all know that it's the bomb.com), but I'm specifically referring to my most recent experience. 

I ordered a to-go order, as I live right around the corner. I was quoted 15 minutes. This was a Tuesday evening. Apparently, they were slammed and this wasn't usual. However, I came 20 minutes later and my food wasn't ready. This is excusable, it was busy. 

However, I waited to simply be acknowledged standing at the cash register for almost 5 minutes. It's a small restaurant, I'm not invisible in the place. I finally pay, and then my food is handed to me. No big deal, right?

I get home, and realize that both of the precious deep fried quesadillas are barely edible. They had been so overcooked that they were mostly solid dark matter on the inside. I was heartbroken, but decided that I would call back the next morning to mention it, because they were busy. 

That was a mistake, I was told that the owner is only there on two specific days of the week, and of course, that wouldn't be there until the following week. They wouldn't provide me a number for the owner (nor a name now that I think about it). I left my name and phone number, and still haven't received a phone call. This was two weeks ago. 

So...I'm not happy, and I probably won't eat there again based off of the principle. Which sucks, because I like the food, but hate the service thus far.
