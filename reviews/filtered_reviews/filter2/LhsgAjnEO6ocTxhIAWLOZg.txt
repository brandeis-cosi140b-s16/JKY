Pros
- Mexican food directly across the street from our hotel ( The Wynn )
- Chips & salsa had 3 different salsas. They were all pretty good and none of them were way too hot.
-The frozen margaritas were awesome ! 
-The plastic to-go cup for my frozen cocktail
-Quaisadia's !  They were awesome both times

 Cons
-The SERVICE ! It was horrible !
First time it was our servers attitude - she was a bitch. 
Second time - i sat alone waiting for someone to come by and take my drink order- I had a magazine And was on page 39 before someone came by. I was pissed ! 
I would of left but I was starving, hot & thirsty. 
Finally she came over, didn't even apologize for my wait ! 
Then I waited some more .....

Bottom
Line / food and drinks were good ( except the organic margarita/ it was nasty And my GF sent it back ) 
So if you think its worth shit service for pretty good food / then check it out.

Otherwise go to one of thousands of Other food places in Vegas / places that have both good food & great service .
