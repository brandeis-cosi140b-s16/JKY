I came here on a Sunday night around 12:30 give or take. I ordered a yard of some flavor margarita, and a friend ordered a pina colada. Everyone else just had beer.

Let me first say that my drink was too strong to be close to enjoyable. It was a truly disgusting drink and I can honestly say I've never had anything worse. 
Next, my friend's pina colada was in the same condition, though in a smaller cup. She asked if the bartender could fix it, and he added something - not sure what, to sweeten it and it tasted the exact same. He had a bit of an attitude about it and eventually she just got a beer and the awful concoction she had was thrown out.

I might give this place a try for their food next time, but never again will I order anything but a beer (you can't screw that up). Though chances are I'll never be back all together.
