Went there tonight.  My wife ordered the fajitas and I ordered a 3 item combo.  The fajitas were good.  My 3 item combo was lackluster.  The chicken taco had a weird taste, and the tamale had enchilada sauce on it.  All items were very bland and we had to add salt.  The beans and rice on the other hand were amazing.  The service was typical counter food.  The tables were clean.  The TVs were annoying - luckily there was no volume, so it was bearable.
