We went as a family and each of us purchased a different combo. It looked like and interesting concept but we did not finish the meals. The chicken had a boiled texture that was rubbery. The pork was tendure and had a good flavor but overall we did not enjoy the meals. The mixture of latin and asian was not something that mixed well with us. The service was good and they were friendly.
