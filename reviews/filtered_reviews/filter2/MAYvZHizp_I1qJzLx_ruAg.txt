The food at Cafe Rio is good, very good. The atmosphere is nice and well executed, and feels kinda indie and cool for a chain restaurant.

However, The place is always packed and the service staff is probably one of the rudest staffs I've encountered. I've probably eaten there 20 times in the last year. and I have only ever had one friendly experience with staff, they hate giving suggestions or answering questions about the food.

It's rather frustrating. The staff at similar restaurants that are just as busy in the area are quite a bit friendlier and open to giving suggestions and answering questions.

I made the decision not to return a few months ago due to the long wait to be treated poorly.
