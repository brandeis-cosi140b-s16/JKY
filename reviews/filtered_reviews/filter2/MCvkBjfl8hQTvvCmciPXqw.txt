Went here for dinner a month ago while staying at New York New York.  It was relatively early Saturday night (6ish) and got seated right away.  

The food was mediocre at best.  I had a barbacoa burrito, which was decent in flavor and quality of meat. However, all of the food almost felt like it had been pre-made and then microwaved to order.  

It wasn't horrible, but there's definitely better options to be had.
