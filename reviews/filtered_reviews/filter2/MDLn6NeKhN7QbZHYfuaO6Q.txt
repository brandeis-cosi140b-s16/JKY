The novelty of Chinese/Mexican and the TV appearance must be the explanation for why this place is so popular.  Everything I had was very, very average.  Menu items were reasonably priced, but then when my portions arrived it was a little disappointing (1 burrito is not going to fill your stomach at lunch).  So, keep in mind you'll be ordering several items, or going home hungry.

Cleanliness was somewhat of an issue, but I think it's partly beause it is in a run-down strip mall and seems like a run down atmosphere inside.  There was an employee actively cleaning tables but it just didn't feel right in there.
