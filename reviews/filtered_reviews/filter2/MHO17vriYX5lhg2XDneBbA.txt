My buddy and I stopped in here for lunch because it was convenient.  My expectations were low, and damn if El Segundo Sol didn't disappoint.  It just wasn't very good.  I ordered the cane asada tacos at $19.95.  When the plates arrived, I realized for the first time you have to assemble the tacos yourself.  The menu omits that little detail.  The asada was "ok" but the tacos still sucked.  Onions, and perhaps a little cheese to put on them would have been nice.  Salsa?  Well, you have to dip into the salsa for the chips for that.  I tasted the rice and beans, but didn't bother with either beyond that.  The words "tourist trap" come to mind.
