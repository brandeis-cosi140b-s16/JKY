Not impressed at all. Beautiful place inside and out but the food not so much. Our two dishes were the Chilean sea bass with cilantro lime rice and asparagus and the beef enchiladas. The bass dish was tasty but I'm not so sure the fish was cooked through. The enchiladas were terrible. The meat had no flavor and the sauce taste like it came from a can.  The flan for dessert however was awesome. We also had the ahi tuna tacos and they were delicious. So I guess it's hit or miss. Not worth the high prices to gamble. I won't be back. The sign outside says "Modern Mexican Food" what does that mean anyway?
