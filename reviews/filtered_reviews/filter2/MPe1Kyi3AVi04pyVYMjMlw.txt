Wanna be Pink Taco. Bad service at the bar, the manager explained my friends meal at "beef" even though she is a vegetarian and it wasn't that taco. Juke box is a horrible idea. Had to listen to eminem and heavy metal. They send out meals according to when it's ready and prepared so it doesn't get cold in the back, yet it gets cold because you don't want to be rude and start eating without your company having their food. The place itself is very cute and could be really cool, unfortunately I was let down. Save your money and go to chipotle
