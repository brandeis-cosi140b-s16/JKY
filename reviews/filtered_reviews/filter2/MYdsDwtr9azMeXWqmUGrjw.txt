Let me preface this by saying that I grew up on the border, so when it comes to Mexican food my expectations are pretty high. However, I keep that in mind, and try to temper them any time I'm trying something new.

We went on a Saturday evening, lured by all of the great Yelp recommendations, and yikes. I'm hoping that the chef had the night off.

The restaurant was pretty much empty when we got there. We sat outside, which was nice aside from being so close to the road. Our table started off with the ("award-winning") guacamole that our server suggested. It was fresh, but very basic. If they seasoned it or added anything to the avocados at all, none of us could tell (which makes it a bowl of avocados by the way... you gotta do something to them if you're going to call it guac). It turned out to be our favorite part of the meal.

We all got three different tacos for our entrees, so we got to taste almost all of them. All three of us were disappointed. There was no flavor to any of them! Nothing was seasoned, it tasted like nothing at all was done to the food in the cooking process. It was like they spent more time putting it on the plates than cooking it. You couldn't even taste the individual ingredients; everything was just... bland. It was definitely not what I would expect from an upscale Mexican restaurant. I was a little embarrassed to have recommended the place. 

Milagro's food is expensive. It looks expensive. Unfortunately, the taste just wasn't there.
