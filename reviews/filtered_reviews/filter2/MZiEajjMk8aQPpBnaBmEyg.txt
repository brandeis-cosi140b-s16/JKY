It was dead on a Friday night, across the street from a hoppin' movie theater. That alone should have told me to temper down my expectations. The staff were super friendly, but the menu in place differs from what their website and Yelp show: new menu has more items but is more expensive too.

The asada fries I was originally considering are now up to $11- nevermind.
Ordered their tacos azules: one fish, one shrimp; and a basic carnitas taco. Salsa bar is pretty basic with a hot, a mild, and a spicy option, and limes.

 Opened my takeout order to find three azules-style tacos- the carnitas was topped with cabbage and a cream sauce instead of cilantro and onions. 
Carnitas was dry and crispy, fish and shrimp were mediocre: fish was baked and flavorless instead of baja style; bay shrimp were tiny and bland.
 
Not thrilled that I spent $10 for three tiny street tacos,  ate 1.5 before tossing the rest. Poor value- I suspect the management raised prices to accommodate for their lack of traffic. 
Maybe cut your staff instead: friendly or not, it doesn't take four people to run this place. I was the only customer, and somehow managed to they overcharge me and mess up my order.
