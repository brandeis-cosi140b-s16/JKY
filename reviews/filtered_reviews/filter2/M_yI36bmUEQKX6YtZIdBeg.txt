So this recent trip took off one star for me.

The sangria was like kool-aid, the guac had zero flavor and hostess got mad when we wanted to choose our own table near the window after discovering it was too windy to enjoy the patio. 

When you choose to spend money and calories on a dinner out- you don't want it to be a MEH experience. I think they rely heavily on the location, out of towners and people who don't know what Mexican food should be like.

Oh the plus side:

Our server was nice.
The plantains were good.
