Received free margarita for checking in, so decided to go here for Cinco De Mayo. The margarita was served on the rocks in a very small glass. We could not taste any liquor in the drink,  and noticed other folks paying for their drinks had full size glasses. We've been traveling the southwest (new mexico, arizona, california and west tx) for a month eating at a different Mexican restaurant every day and this place is nothing out of the ordinary. The flour tortillas tasted store bought and the green chili verde was gross, pork rubbery not falling apart like we are used to. The chips, salsa and bean dip are served complimentary, but did not wow us. Our server Lorenzo was arrogant and acted as if we inconvenienced him. Worst food we have had in a month. We will not be back. Go to Yuma or Tucson for some really great authentic Mexican cuisine.
