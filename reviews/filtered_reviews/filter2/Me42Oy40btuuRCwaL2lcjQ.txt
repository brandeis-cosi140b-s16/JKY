I went to Senor Frog's on a weeknight. There were not many people there. I sat at the bar and ordered my food and drink. The service at the bar was prompt and my food came out quickly so no complaints for bar service. I ordered a beef burrito that cost 19 dollars. I ordered chips and queso and two margaritas. I expected to get a burrito with rice and beans like most Mexican plates. The burrito came out, it was very big but it had no sauce on it and no rice and beans For the price, it should have rice and beans. The food was not bad, just ok and the burrito was a little bland. The two margaritas came in small plastic cups and tasted like a fruit slushy, they were watery, very sweet  and very weak on the alcohol. All in all, my bill for one burrito, one chips and queso and two tiny, weak margaritas in a small plastic cup came to a whopping 55 dollars before tip. I realize that prices are higher on the strip but this was way too high priced for what you get.
