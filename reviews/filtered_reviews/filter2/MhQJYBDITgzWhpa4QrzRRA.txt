Ok... So if things come out one at a time...with the intention of sharing... Then let us know... 1 plate of tacos... 3 minutes... 2nd... 15 minutes....    then the price...Lets talk for a moment about value...     Tacos...   nothing else just tacos...salsa extra....chips extra.....    2 doors down at yard house 40% less costly for more and better food.   sat us in a table the size of elementary project table.... Not a fan.     Seriously with Yard House right next door and the price and value....  

Maybe they just opened and this experience was a flook, but it would take some convincing to go back.    Dissapoining
