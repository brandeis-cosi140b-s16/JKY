1st off I wanna say the people that work there were very nice and polite. The store location is nice and it's clean. My problem was the food. Ive eaten so much mexican food in my life that i feel im part mexican. We got chicken street tacos. They were ok. Nothing special really. We also ordered mexican corn, which wasn't bad. I also ordered a carne asada burrito. It wasn't good at all. There was rice in the burrito which was new to me. I didn't like the taste. The burrito barely had meat in it. A carne asada burrito is supposed to be full of meat. There was more meat in the chicken taco then the carne asada burrito. I'll be honest I was disappointed, we went out our way to come here.
