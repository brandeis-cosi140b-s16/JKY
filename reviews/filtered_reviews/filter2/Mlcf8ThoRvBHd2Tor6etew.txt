I came in for a quick bite to eat after my sister told me they had good tacos and burritos and vegetarian-friendly. 

I thought I'd try a variety and order one fish, one cactus and one veggie/bean. 

First strike? I got attitude for a asking a few questions and asking that they leave the cheese and sour cream off. Then after ordering I realized they use flour tortilla (listed NO WHERE on the board) and asked that they use corn tortilla instead of their flour since I am gluten-free. 

Ok, whatever. I get it. I am complicated and so are my orders. This isn't new.

Second strike? They were slower than hell! 

Their fish tacos were delicious. Oh so messy and oh so yummy.
But the cactus tacos? It was just OK. And the black bean taco? Not so much. It was bland and dry. 

Maybe I just had high-expectations for a Taco joint in Phoenix?

I'd try them again just for their fish tacos if I was nearby, but I wouldn't go out of my way.
