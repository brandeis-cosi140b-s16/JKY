We go to OTB about 4 - 5 times per month....always sit in the bar area.  Usually there for a light dinner.  Was always happy (we had a "regular" waitress whom I cannot recall her name, but she was awesome)...lately, it seems to be someone different each time.  The past few visits have been a comedy of errors.  One dinner completely forgotten and was brought out after the other person was completely finished with theirs and three times (including last night) cold food that should have been hot had to be sent back.  Last night, it was something simple...French fries.  They were COLD...who knows when they came out of the fryer.  Waitress was nice....guy who brought the food out and then took the French fries back for fresh ones was a jerk.  OTB is convenient, but definitely thinking of finding a new place.  Wondering if the management has changed.
