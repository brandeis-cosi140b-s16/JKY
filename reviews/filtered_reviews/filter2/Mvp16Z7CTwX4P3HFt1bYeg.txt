sorry... my least fav of the Michoacan restaurants. Love love love the original one on Desert Inn. The one on Decatur is good, and like the one on Flamingo. This one is not up to par.... it is the closest to my house, but I will drive to another location because this one is just not the same level of food.
Service is good, thats why I am giving them the 2 stars, and the chips beans and salsa are good no matter what location you pick.
I have eaten here 5 or 6 times, just not the same as the other locations......
