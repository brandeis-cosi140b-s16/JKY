We went for dinner in early Sept, 2012.  The vegetarian salads were loaded with romaine and white rice and black beans mixed together.  The bean mixture had a pasty consistency.  The tortilla underneath the salad is cold by the time you can get to it.  The noise level was quite loud both in the volume of music and overall acoustics.  The evening sun poured in to the entire restaurant and people were walking around shielding their eyes.  Not a great first impression.
