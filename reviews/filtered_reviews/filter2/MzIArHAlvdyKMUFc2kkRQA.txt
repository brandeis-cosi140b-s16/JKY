This place has potential but needs a lot of work. The flavor of the meat is good but other than that it is not worth the money. The kids menu is ridiculous. The kids taco plate consists of ONE taco and nothing else. For an extra $1.50 you can add a soda to it. I don't know about anybody else's kids but mine can eat more than just one taco. The employees were all lost and confused. None of them knew what came in the kids meal also after we paid we were informed that tacos are $2 on Tuesdays. How did the employees not know this? I would not come back it was not worth it at all.
