Definitely an airport restaurant - no mistaking that! I got the Shrimp Tacos and we shared the Nachos with Pork. The Nachos were better than I had anticipated, but the Shrimp Tacos were just plain silly - they came with some sort of pathetic 1000 Island dressing trying to cop a Chipotle accent. Stop it!
