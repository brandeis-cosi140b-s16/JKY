Tequila Bar, I came here after reading reviews on yelp. I was looking for a cheap bar with decent drinks. When I saw they had a 128oz Blue Fishbowl for $20 I YELPed! But was disappointed to hear they had no 
"fishbowls" and would service it in two large cups. The two cups turned out to be 64oz Plastic pitchers, which was pretty fun. What wasn't fun was that 1. It has no "fishies" in it (like the picture) and 2. It was 90% Soda. Boo! But hey, for the novelty- the price wasn't bad!

The Nacho's at the next table did look pretty delectable, but I just came from a big dinner so I just ordered the "southwestern corn on the cob". I was curious. What made it southwestern? I should have known when I ordered it and the waiter said, corn- you want the corn? ok. And Corn is exactly what I got. Just boiled corn with a square of butter... for $3 - FAIL
