Being a local, I frequent the Palms for eats and drinks and take friends there visiting from out of town.  If those friends happen to be from So Cal, don't bother taking them here.  BELOW AVERAGE FOOD and no even close to authentic.  The last and final time I was there, Oct 2010, the table-side guacamole was pathetic.  The fruit was not ripe, so the waitress actually had difficulty making it!  I should have sent it back, especially because my daughter wouldn't touch it and she inhales the stuff at home and at other establishments like Agave and Lindo.  Agree with other comments, this place USED TO BE GOOD, but it sucks now.  Even their management was apathetic to my comments and complaints.  Done.
