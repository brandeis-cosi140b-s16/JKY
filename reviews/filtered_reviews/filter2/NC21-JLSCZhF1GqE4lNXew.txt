Boring, expensive, and now I know why I've not eaten here after 22 years in the valley. 

The salsa and chips were the highlight. Enchilada tasted like nothing, enchilada sauce would have been better if it came out of a can, chili rellanos were OK, maybe less than OK. Prices were high for the quality and quantity. Do yourself a favor and visit Juan's instead. 

Quite a crowd here for a Friday night, and why? El Rey in Globe has much better Mexican food, the rest of the Globe-Miami area isn't exactly a mecca of Mexican food so the review of best of Globe-Miami isn't a ringing endorsement.
