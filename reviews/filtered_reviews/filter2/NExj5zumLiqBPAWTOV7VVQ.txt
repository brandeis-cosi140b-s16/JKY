Been here twice so far.  

Best:
- Salsa is addictive,  much spicier than anywhere else around,  which I love. 
-Enchilada sauce is great as well. 
-They are fairly cheap. 

Worst:
-The service is soooooo slooooooow. It takes forever for them to take your order or bring your food out.  The first time we went we were there over an hour. 
-The food is not that great in my opinion,  Serranos is much better & faster. 
-The decor is awful!  

Overall I don't think I would go back.
