Nice bar to go in for lunch or watch the game.  They have a separate restaurant area but menu is the same.  The nachos are pretty good, good ceviche.  I also tried the Chimichanga Burrito, was tasty but nothing to do cartwheels over.  The service is pretty good & waitresses/waiters attentive.  This is not a mexican restaurant, so go somewhere else if that's what you're in the mood for.
I'll go back but it's not high on my favorites list.
