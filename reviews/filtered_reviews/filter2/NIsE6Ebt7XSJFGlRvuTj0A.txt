Sorry kids, after hearing many people raving about this place, my girlfriend and i finally decided that we needed our Mexican fix. We love Mexican food, but apparently we have become too accustomed to the run of the mill 'authentic' Mexican food. Not the Chipotle or Moes, but the sit-down  restaurant with menus with wet burritos and a listing of 30+ numbered dishes. 
i had a traditional Mexican dish, while she had  a Tex Mex burrito. Her burrito was huge, but she only eat a few bites, It just wasn't good. i had the traditional enchiladas and they were slightly more edible, however, we wouldn't go back for either dish. The beans were like a bad bean soup, the rice didn't have much taste (other than the peas mixed in), 

The atmosphere was great and the server was very attentive and i really wanted to like the place, but i can't say i'll be back.
