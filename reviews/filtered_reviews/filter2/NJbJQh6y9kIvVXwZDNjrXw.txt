Robertos was on my food list for my October trip.  I tried it and well, meh.

First, let me say I like the set up of the serve yourself salsa bar.  I like that they have three kinds of salsa and that lovely melange of spicy carrots and onions .  That was the highlight.  The food left me disappointed.  I ordered:

1. 3 Rolled Chicken Tacos- they were the skinniest, hardest, blandest things I tried to eat.  I had them add guac to go on top.  I stopped after eating one and a half.  They were sad.  And that "guac"?  Someone ought to be arrested selling that as guac.  It was like eating sour cream with green food coloring.  
2.  Steak Tacos - I have never had steak tacos so bland.  I doused them with the tomatillo sauce giving it much needed help.

The only thing that tasted fresh and was hot?

3.  Cheese Quesadilla - imagine that.  A simple quesadilla was the only thing I finished and enjoyed.

If I could make a meal from cheese quesadillas and the salsa bar, I'll be back.
