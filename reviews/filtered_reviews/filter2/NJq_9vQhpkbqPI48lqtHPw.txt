Pedro's has been around for over 60 years, and tends to get rave reviews! I have tried it twice over the last year, and was underwhelmed each time. Hey, I may have been on an off day...twice. haha. Both times the food was mediocre at best. I am Mexican, so I may be basing their food off authentic mexican food, which this was not. Very true what other reviews have said, that the food was Americanized, but truly how can you make MEXICAN food American? The service was alright, but I almost felt rushed both times, how they drop the bill at the table. Also, after the drop off of food I felt like I had to chase down the server for more salsa. 

This is great for people who want a fairly cheap quick lunch, but not somewhere I will be returning to. I would much rather go right up the road to La Perla for authentic Mexican cuisine!
