I used to frequent this particular Sylvia's La Canasta a few years ago, and today decided to meet a friend there for lunch. My, how things have changed. In addition to completely revamping the inside decor, the menu has evidently undergone a big overhaul, along with the quality of the food. My machaca taco was "meh" at best, and the rice and beans were such a small portion on my plate, I almost didn't find them. The service was acceptable, but I was taken aback that the flour tortilla chips are no longer standard fare with the salsa, and if we wanted those, it would be $4.00 dollars more! WTF?? Sorry....food was not very good and they are charging for things that were once standard fare. Won't be back.
