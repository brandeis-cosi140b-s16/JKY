This place has great food...... However, I've ordered online five separate times. Each time I received the wrong order and each time was a different wrong order. Do yourself a favor and just go stand in line, don't order online. The other problem I have is the last time I picked up food there, there was a homeless person with a sign begging for food/money asleep with a of his belongings at a table in the dining area. In the end, it's good if you just go there, order your food there, and take it to go. Otherwise you'll be sorely disappointed.
