Met a friend there for Christmas as we had a gift card.  Glad we had it because the food wasn't worth the prices by a LONG shot.  Nothing met our expectations.  The chicken fajitas were merely a stock chicken breast sliced up on a bed of greasy grilled onions and peppers with way too much garlic on top.  The beans were tepid and should not have been served, the coffee was certainly not premium and seemed to be cheap restaurant blend coffee.  My wife was disappointed as all of her food was too spicy with nothing available to relieve the heat (and she enjoys hot food!) Our friend had the gelatinous soup discussed in earlier posts.  Sorry to say this restaurant is occupying prime space in my neighborhood that could be occupied my a much better restaurant.  Won't go back.
