All we were looking for was an outdoor patio to enjoy a drink or two before heading to the airport but unfortunately, we chose Cabo Wabo.  The outdoor patio is great but the service was pretty bad and the food was nothing special.  There was a sign by the hostess stand that said pitchers of beer for $15 - a steal in Vegas for sure!  We asked our waiter what beers qualified and he listed off a few decent Mexican beers so we took him up on the offer and ordered a pitcher of Dos XX Lager.  About 5 minutes later he came back and told us they were out of that one so we ordered the Tecate instead.  5 minutes more he came back and said all they had was Coors Light, WTF?? How do you advertise a special and not carry anything that's supposed to be on the special??  Someone must be terrible at ordering product or they just don't give a crap, not sure which.  Our waiter was really nice about it though and he was embarrassed as well so I can't place all of the blame on him.  We decided to go with margaritas and then some bottled Mexican beers to follow and when we got our check, we really wished that $15 beer special would have been available, such a rip off!  The chips and salsa were pretty lame and the taquitos were ok but my friend said her tacos were bad.  Overall, come for the beers specials and that's it...but make sure they're available first!!
