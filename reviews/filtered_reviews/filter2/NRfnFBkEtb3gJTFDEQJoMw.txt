Went here for late lunch one Saturday with a friend and i was decidedly underwhelmed. The Cozumel Burrito looked very promising, but was pretty "meh" when I got it. It was OK, but the sauce was a little ketchupy. My friend was reasonably satisfied with whatever it was he ordered, but neither of us was blown away.

The biggest gripe I had with this place was the service! We'd just come from a 20 mile bike ride on a hot day, and although I'd been guzzling down and refilling my water constantly, I was perpetually thirsty. I left my water bottle outside on my bike assuming I could get a nice cold glass of water on entering. I literally asked our waiter for water at least 3 times before we got it, including once getting up and walking across the restaurant to the bar. When he finally brought us water, he was not in the least bit apologetic for the delay. Were they busy I'dve been more understanding, but as I said this was post lunch-time rush and there weren't a lot of other tables. This was, however, during the world cup, so maybe the football was decidedly more important than his customers.
