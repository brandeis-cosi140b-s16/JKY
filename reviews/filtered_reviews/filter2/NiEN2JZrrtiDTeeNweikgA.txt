Went to this place after arriving at Tacos el Gordo and seeing a loooooong line (it was understandable since it was noon on a Sunday).  Had high hopes with the reviews I had seen on Yelp.

Let me tell you, HUGE disappointment.  I ordered a carne asada taco (3.50) with avocado (1.00) and no beans (1.00, yes i had to pay a dollar to have beans excluded from my taco!!!).  Overall, taco had no flavor. Tortillas were nothing special, Pico de Gallo was bland and the taco does not come with cilantro or onion.  The ONLY reason I gave them 2 stars is because the quality of the carne asada was good (no yucky fatty pieces) and the avocado was freshly made without any filler (some places add tomato or sour cream to make the avocado go further).

I also got a plain cheese quesadilla (maize/corn) and that was garbage.  Tortilla was drenched in oil and you can tell they use the cheapest quality cheese.  Quesadilla was so bad it is not worth another word from me.

There were people in my group that said the lengua and chorizo tacos were pretty good so I would try those instead if that is your fort√©.
