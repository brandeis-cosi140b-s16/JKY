Green Dacha was my favorite restaurant the first 7 times I ordered from them.  The food is amazing, everyone was helpful, and then I don't know what happened.  I tried to order something very simple (Hummus w/Ground Beef) and 2.5 hrs later my food didn't come.  Then they tell me they are closing and can't deliver my food now but they are sorry and I can call back and speak with Alexander and get a discount.   Then I call back and the owner is someone else, Julia, and they don't know what I'm talking about.  So all in all I'd say I'm never coming back here again but it was good while it lasted, kinda like a relationship in your 20s - Anthony
