Went to Border Grill to sit on the patio so we can enjoy Maroon 5 live performing at Mandalay Bay LV! First of all the hostess forgot about us, even tho we were waiting at the bar, next the server took forever, she did take the order, but haven't seen her since! Food has been broad by other people which is ok, she never returned to refill the drinks, or ask for another round, took at least 30 minutes just to ask for a check (i did ask other servers and passing by employees for one) and pay out!l Couple that was sitting at the table next to us was pissed too, cuz their drinks came out after the food, so is the One's next to them! Server blamed the bar, but there were only 5 people at the bar! I work as a server myself so I don't ever complain about service, I know how difficult it can be sometimes, but this particular place was horrible! Although food was good! Pretty basic Mexican food!
