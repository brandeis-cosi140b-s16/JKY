We came to dinner at Javier's on February 2, 2013, to celebrate a 60th birthday.  Upon, arrival we were seated promptly and our server arrived at our table within a few minutes to take our drink order; however, the pleasantries ended shortly thereafter.  After waiting over 45 minutes for our dinner entrees and unable to locate our waiter, we approached the  manager, who was extremely rude to ask if there was a problem with our order.  After a few minutes she located our server, he stated that our food was almost ready and would be at the table within five minutes, but we still did not get our food until approximately 40 minutes later.  The food itself was good, although some of the items were cold.  When we received our bill, it stated we were a party of eight so they added an 18% gratuity to the bill when we were actually a party of seven. 

I believe strongly in giving a good tip when it is warranted, but due to the inadequate service provided by our waiter, it should have been our option to decide what amount to give to him.

The manager at Javier's should also improve her attitude and be more courteous to the customers.  Her impolite and discourteous behavior is as poor example of how to conduct one's self in a cusdtomer-seviced based industry.
