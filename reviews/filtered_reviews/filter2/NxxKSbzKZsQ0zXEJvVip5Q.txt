I went here for a lunch with a big group of girls. Not my favorite restaurant in Vegas. The service was great, and our waitress was friendly, helpful, and chatted with us and our bachelorette of honor a little. No complaints there.

The food is expeeeeeeensive. Even the chips and salsa are $5, shouldn't that be free? I guess they have a prime location and can charge these exorbitant prices, but when I saw the prices, I expected great food. I ordered the chicken taquitos because everything else was over $15 and it was just lunch, and there was no way in hell I could live with myself after ordering a $17 burrito or quesadilla. 

The food came fast but my taquitos were filled with some sort of chicken paste. They were covered in a sour cream squiggle and some lettuce, nothing special. I only ate one. Those who know me know I'm cheap and will take home any food I can, but I didn't even want to box it up. I wish I had ordered the traditional elote, which was $5 and looked hard to mess up.

Our waitress encouraged us all to order Sancho margaritas, in huge, take-home cups, for $24. The blended strawberry was decent, but my mango on the rocks was overly sweet, artificial tasting, and not good. No one else really liked theirs either, but we felt guilty not drinking them because of how much we paid. Bridget P not finishing her alcohol is unheard of, but it happened today. 

I guess this place continues to draw crowds because of its awesome location. I don't think I'll be back.
