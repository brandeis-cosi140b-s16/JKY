Eater LV brought me here with "The 24 Hottest Restaurants in Las Vegas Right Now, January 2015"

If you want subpar, expensive Mexican food, Border Grill is perfect.
The Border Grill inside Cesar's Palace is supposed to have a completely different menu than other locations, equipped with a ceviche bar.

We got the Guacamole, Grilled Catfish Tacos, Short Rib Enchiladas, and Chicken Enchiladas. My grilled catfish was kind of bitter and even MORE bitter with a grapefruit garnish. While my green and red rice were a bit hard and undercooked.
Nothing really was absolutely delicious, and didn't stand out to the point where I felt like it was worth $30 a plate. 

I really liked the decor and the plates with the cute little drawings. Some chicken and meat products are free-range and organic.  

But on a serious note, if i re-plated Chipotle food on these dishes and decor, I would have had a better experience.
