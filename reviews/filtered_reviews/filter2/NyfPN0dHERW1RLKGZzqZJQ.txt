My husband and I came in here during a recent trip to Vegas. We had:

* Chips and Salsa (two salsas - one red and smoky, the other spicy and green).
* The "Salsa" Trio - guacamole, queso, and sour cream. Oddly enough, no salsa?
* Chicken Tortilla Soup.
* Oven-Roasted Broccoflower Soup with Green Chile Puree and Sweet Corn Dumpling.
* Chili-Lime Chicken Fajitas.
* Combo - chili rellenos, chicken tamale, barbacoa burrito.

We really weren't impressed with the food here at all. It started out good though. We both enjoyed the salsas that were brought to the table. The broccoflower soup was a little watery but had great flavor. Everything else was terrible. The chicken tortilla soup was bland. The entrees took far too long and were definitely not worth the wait. The chile lime chicken fajitas tasted like store brought chicken strips. They were pretty much flavorless, with no tasteable chile or lime anywhere. The sauteed peppers were the best thing on the plate. The combo plate was buried in sour cream. It looked bad and tasted bad. The tamale was dry and flavorless, the chili rellenos were soggy and the barbacoa was dry. 

Not to mention that there was some emergency light flashing over our head for half the meal, and the constant slot machine sounds. If I ever return to Vegas, I won't be making a stop in here.
