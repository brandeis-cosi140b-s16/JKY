Just an overall disappointing experience. Sunday around 7:30pm. The food was just ok. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat it again. The servers were decent when they actually acknowledged our presence. As we waited and waited and waited for our bill and our server to come back in the building we counted the employees. Including kitchen staff and bar tenders there were approximately 15 employees onsite. They seemed to be more interested in each other than the customers. Some looked like they may have been off the clock or just hanging out but still went back and forth behind the bar and in the kitchen so it's hard to say. It was painfully difficult to get someone's attention. Mind you there were only about 20 or so customers in the place. We finally got our bill and waited another 10 minutes or so for someone to pick it up.  We even joked that it felt like a prank show to see how long we could keep our cool! Again, disappointing!
