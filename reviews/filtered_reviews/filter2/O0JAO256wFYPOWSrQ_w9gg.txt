For the most part, I really like their  food. However, I went there this past weekend and ordered some of the guacamole with my meal. It tasted stale/old and I mentioned it to my waitress. Instead of taking it off the table (I did not eat it) and taking it off my bill, she came back to explain that the kitchen said that it all depended on the quality of the avocados from day to day and that I had the bad luck of getting the bad avacodos. Not her exact words, but her sentiment.  Wrong answer! Her tip reflected it.  I will be hesitant to go back in the near furture and will definitely not have the guacamole again, which is an upsale because I always order extra with my meal.
