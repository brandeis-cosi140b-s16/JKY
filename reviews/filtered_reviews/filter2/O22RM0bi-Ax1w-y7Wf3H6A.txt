Food is average, it is a bit pricey for what you get and I'm not sure why. The salsas are really good. 

3.95 for a small taco....they charge you 2.95 after one basket of chips. And the chips are sub par. My mom & other famliy members love & frequent this place so i've tried it on several occasions & it's just as bland every time.
