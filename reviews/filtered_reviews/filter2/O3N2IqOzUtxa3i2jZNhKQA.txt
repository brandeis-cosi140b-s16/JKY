To me, Blanco was just fair Mexican food, with a tiny bit of inspiration, however they try to pass it off as if this restaurant is the greatest thing since the scoop chip.

First things first, they have a michelada on their drink menu, but don't order it!  Even if you've had wonderful micheladas in the past, Blanco's is terrible, with WAY TOO MUCH worchester sauce and not enough lime...yucky!  

The chips and salsa were actually really good, as well as the guacamole.  I had the ahi tacos, which were overseasoned, presumably to cover up the not-so-fresh taste of the fish.  My wife had a veggie burrito, which was huge in size, but not in taste.  The rice they serve with the dishes is to, die, for!  Next time I visit, if ever again, I am ordering just a bowl of the buttered rice...delicious. 

The service at this restaurant was borderline terrible, from needing to ask for everything, including more chips and water refills, to waiting too long for food, which then came out on an extremely hot plate, as if it had been sitting under a window for far too long!

And again Blanco, why the attitude? The food is not that great, your servers aren't that hot and your drinks are weak, get over yourselves.
