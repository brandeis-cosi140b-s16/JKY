I love Mexican food!!! One of the first things I always try when I go to a new place is the Chiles Rellenos.  Its a great benchmark for the overall quality, "tastyness", and value of most everything on the menu.

Is the chili fresh and prepared well? (Hatch or not Hatch).
Is the chili stuffed with a delectable Mexican cheese mix (or just  jack cheese)?
What kind of batter? egg? breading?  (One place I went had a deep fried, crumpled saltine cracker crust that was surprisingly good).
Are sides included?

Habanero's Chiles Rellenos wasn't all that great.  Far to many seeds left in the chili for my taste.  Just melted jack on the inside.  Mostly egg battered outside (not very thick).  I don't think the chili was roasted in any special way or given any other kind of seasoning...Overall it was Meh.

The chili came with a side of beans that were authentic yet a little boring.  Also included:  A little Spanish rice (also boring).  Pico was yucky.  They are very generous with the sour cream.  (I noticed that sour cream and guacamole are included in most dishes so you don't have to pay extra).  Cool.
