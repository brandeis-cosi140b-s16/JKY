I was very excited to try this place. My friends have raved about it. The food was pretty good , I tried the puffy tacos with chorizo and chile verde, very good. The service on the other hand, was horrible. Having worked. The service industry( ok Dairy Queen ) I appreciate good service . I am diabetic.. The waitress came within 10 minutes which was fine.. and I was sitting outside. But I felt like I was ignored. But as soon as I went in another 15 minutes later I was promptly served my drink and chips and salsa. I would recommend hiring busboys.. or maybe you have them. Anyway, service is big to me , so  disappointing, 
I won't be back .
