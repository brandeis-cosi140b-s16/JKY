I was hoping for some really delicious Latin American food, but ended up being sorely disappointed. I ordered an arepa (which normally I love), and it was too cheesy, saucy, and not heated through all the way. My buddy had tacos, which he seemed to like okay, but said they weren't anything special. I unlocked the Yelp deal for free chips and they were pooled in grease. I felt guilty and wasteful throwing them away, but by then, I'd lost my appetite. Bummer.
