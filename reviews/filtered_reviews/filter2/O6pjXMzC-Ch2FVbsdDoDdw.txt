Im rating this location only. I've been to a number of Roberto's in Vegas this one is not great. If you like going to a taco shop and being stared at as you wait for your food this is your place. I ordered my usual Roberto's... Bean and cheese burrito and tamales. I was highly disappointed! The cheese on the bean and cheese was overwhelming. There was more cheese then beans and it was in one big clump. The tamales were decent but were kind of dry and hard/over cooked. 

I usually get a cup so I can get water well apparently this place doesn't believe in water because they have no water button on their fountain thing. The guys behind the counter were gawking so uncomfortably I was very relieved when my food finally came up. I probably won't be going back to this location.
