Sadly, I was not impressed with this place. I was excited to see a full service Mexican Rest. in this Chandler area besides bar food, seafood, steak and italian.  My husband and I stopped in for lunch during their opening week. I was not impressed with the food. The floor had food droppings on carpet. The staff was friendly however, the hostess/worker (?)  had her family (small children) running all around. The place was not busy but it still was annoying!  We have dinned here before under previous Steak house ownership, all they have done was took down the rustic pictures and painted walls with BRIGHT colors. Thought it would be more upscale Mexican food...but I will go to  Chipotle across street it is fresher!
