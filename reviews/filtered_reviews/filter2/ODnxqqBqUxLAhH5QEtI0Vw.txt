The men's bathroom is always a mess with multiple toilets out of order and a layer of some sort of liquid covering the whole bathroom floor. The two patio bars usually only have two bartenders and take forever to get a drink. Also if you buy a table no matter how much money you spend they will kick you off your table right when you finish all the bottles you paid for.
