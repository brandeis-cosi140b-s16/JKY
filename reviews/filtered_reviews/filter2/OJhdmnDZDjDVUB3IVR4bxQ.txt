The food was OK just but the great burgers we were craving. We ordered David's burger and a Patty Melt and the fries deserved 5 stars but the David's Burger was overcooked, the lettuce was soggy, and way to many onions. The patty melt was more bread than patty, but the grilled onions were tasty. 

When we walked in we seated ourself but the table was dirty. The food took about 20 minutes to get do be prepared if your in a hurry. Very nice old town feel but the food didn't seem to live up to the reviews.
