I took my  pregnant daughter to lunch she was craving Mexican. The restaurant wasnt busy at all and almost all tables were available. I ordered vegetarian burrito. The server we couldn't understand would go to kitchen and carry one item to one table at a time...also barely spoke English. We both ate our food and waited for over 30 minutes to get our bill. I thought that my tomato in the burrito had a weird taste, but ate it anyway. I got so sick on the way home and continued to BARF all evening and part of the next day....never again will I eat there. My daughter had no tomatoes!
