Margaritas have no alcohol in them - and you are seriously still charging over $5?

The tortilla chips and salsa were the tastiest part of the meal.

The service was very efficient and friendly but the waiter had a thick accent that was hard to understand.

I ordered the torta with steak, guacamole and sauce on the side.  The bread was the worst torta bread I ever had.  Doughy and white and not grilled.  The steak was flavorless.  The guacamole was to thin - would have preferred big chunks of avocado and the sauce wasn't good either.  My sandwich was served with Ruffles potato chips!  Yuck!

Friend ordered the carne asada mini tacos and wasn't that impressed either.  Hers looked better than mine though!
