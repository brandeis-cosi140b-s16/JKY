I will start by saying that since I'm half Mexican I'm notoriously hard on Mexican food places.

We visited Hussong's because we needed to get a quick bite before The Lion King.  Our first choice, The Burger Bar, had a wait so we decided  to go next door to Hussongs.

I found it to be extremely overpriced.  I understand it's on the Strip but I can see paying almost $20 for a rice and beans dish.

We decided to get appetizers.  My daughter ordered the chicken quesadillas and said they were good but greasy.  I ordered the taquitos and got three very small tacos.  The tortillas were small than El Pastor sized tortillas.  The tacquitos were good but nothing to be excited about.  My friend ordered the Queso Fundido with chorizo.  I get that chorizo is a very greasy sausage but she literally spooned a couple of tablespoons of grease out of the bowl before being able to eat it.  Draining the chorizo wouldn't have affected the taste of the dish at all.

Service was quick and friendly but all in all it was pretty unimpressive.  I'll stay off the Strip and stick to El Sombrero or something similar
