This place is just okay. The food is medium-good, the drinks are moderately priced, and the decor is somewhat interesting. It's a good idea to get out here and TRY a Yinzerita, but expect a heavy sugar headache afterwards. The best part about steel cactus is probably their happy hours on weekdays from 5-7, featuring half-priced appetizers and $5 cocktails. Pro tip: Try their mojito without simple sugars.
