I've already written a glowing review about Cafe Rio's coconut shrimp tacos from another location. I happily made my way in for some tacos yesterday at this particular location. As always, the tacos are a winner!

The overall experience is key to a happy customer. Although the food was on point, their women's bathroom smells like sewage. Sewage may be an understatement. How about sewage with a side of trash and a dash of pig's pen with a sprinkle of BO. It was enough to make me a queasy before devouring my coconut shrimp tacos. 

I hope they get this issue fixed in a hot minute.
