I will summarize my wife and I's experience with Aunt Chilada's in one word: BLAND.  It was pretty forgettable.  I will say that their flour nachos were scrumptious, and if you find yourself there, grab some.  

Our food was nothing but soggy tortillas slathered with melty cheese.  No seasoning whatsoever.  We were on vacation from New York and we had better Tex-Mex there.  I only hope we can find the real Tex-Mex or actual Latin food in this area.  

Also worth noting the wait staff was not very good.  Our hostess and waitress both served us in regular old street clothes and did not look professional at all, and their  demeanor more or less matched it.  They checked in on us only as etiquette required and disappeared as soon as we wanted something.  The only saving grace was a nice youngish waiter who helped us out even though we weren't his table.  

The rating says it all: don't settle for Aunt Chilada's,  at least not on Monday nights.
