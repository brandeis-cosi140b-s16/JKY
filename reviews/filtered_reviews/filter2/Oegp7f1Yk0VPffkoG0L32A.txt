good margaritas, mediocre food.  came here cause rositas (mcdowell/24st) was closed.  the chicken in my chimichanga was dry, rice was hard and the beans were from a can.  charged extra (2.45) for a tiny scoop of rice because the plate only comes with either or (what?).  one step above taco bell.  gf asked for a single tamale and dude said it would be $5
