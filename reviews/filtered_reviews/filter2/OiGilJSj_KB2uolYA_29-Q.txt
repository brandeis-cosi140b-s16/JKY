Bland.  That is the single term I would use to describe this meal.  Even the "spicy" table side guac was bland.  The chile colorado wasn't that great.  A few pieces of the meat were really fatty, and they do the version which is cooked to order and not the version in which the meat simmers in the chile sauce for hours.  To make it worse, they must have had some "bring your screaming young child" promotion or something.  For that I blame the parents for not giving enough of a shit about teaching their kids about proper public/restaurant etiquette.
