Not like it used to be. :(
Ate here often many years back, and recently decided to revisit...totally disappointed. The food was decent, but so is Taco Bell. The major difference is that you get some chips and salsa with your meal here. 
Not the experience I recall, and not a great deal either. Save yourself the money. Bummer!
