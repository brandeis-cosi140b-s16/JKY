I went in really wanting to like this place. We were heading to a show. Feeling fun. And hungry. And really thirsty. The three of us were seated on the back patio, which I think was nice, but dark. Oddly dark. We each ordered beers, and I asked nicely for a very large glass of water. Beers arrive, no water.
Our waitress returned to take our order. No water. We had some questions about the menu, which she answered, and then asked for her personal recommendation out of a couple options, to which she replied "oh it's all really good". Okay. and about that water...?
Our tacos came, no silverware, no water. 
She brought the silverware, and yes, the food was "all really good", but a little small. The pork and shrimp were a little too sweet for me-- I would have liked some more spice to balance it out-- but my friends liked them. The carne asada with chimichurri was the unanimous winner.
The server cleared our plates, and gave us our cheque (no water, as I'm sure you've guessed). We asked her if there was dessert, since we were still hungry. She seemed shocked, but took our cheque away and told us the desserts. We ordered the rice pudding with sopapillas and horchata ice cream, because how could you not order that?
We waited maybe 20 minutes for the dessert. No one came to check on us to see if we wanted another round of drinks, and we didn't even see our waitress to be able to flag her down. Meanwhile the girl at the table next to us started to do her best Snookie impersonation, although I don't think she was joking. By this point I just wanted to leave. Actually, I had the impression everyone who worked there just wanted to leave too, even though it was only about 8:30....
When the dessert finally came, it was very good, but after we finished it was another seeming eternity before we saw anyone to bring us our cheque.
