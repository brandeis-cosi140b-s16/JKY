I wish it were better!  I really really wanted it to be fantastic!  

The service was medicore at best.  My lunch arrived a full ten minutes before the rest of the table's food arrived - and don't blame it on the crowd - there wasn't one! Monday lunch at 12:45 shouldn't be a challenge.  

The salsa was fresh and the chips were hot but when you have to ask for refills of water - something isn't right!  

Lunch for three (without drinks) was $50 which is pricey since the portions were tasty but small and the rice was so dried out it was enedible! 

 When our server was present she was friendly and knowledgeable but she was often MIA.  Overall skip it - there are too many great choices to spend the time and energy here.  I would have rated it two stars but the salsa and chips moved it up to 2.5!
