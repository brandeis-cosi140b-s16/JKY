Not very efficient. If you are in a hurry I don't recommend this place. It took roughly 25 minutes last night to get 2 burgers, fries, and a shake in the drive-thru. 

Small menu. Not a lot of options. The burger is good but the tacos aren't consistent. 2 out of 3 attempts, the meat has been very dry. 

The motivating factor for this review was the bugs all over the window and wall where you receive the food from the drive-thru. Easily 150 black bugs on the white wall kind of makes you lose your appetite and probably a health code violation.
