Service was friendly and attentive and chips and salsa when we sat down were good, but the rest of the food was not very good.  The meat in my shredded beef taco tasted like it had gone bad.  My tamale needed firmer masa and more flavor, and the red sauce covering it was so bland and tasted like the last can of Rosarita enchilada sauce I regretted cooking with.  Rice and beans both lacked flavor.  I won't be back.
