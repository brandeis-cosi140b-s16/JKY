I keep going back to this place because I love their salad bowl; however, I hate how every time I go my salad gets smaller. Also, I do not like that they move so fast even if I am the only person in line...give me some time to be able to tell you what I want on my order without rushing me like there is no tomorrow. 

The staff is friendly do not get me wrong, but they just need to chill a little....
