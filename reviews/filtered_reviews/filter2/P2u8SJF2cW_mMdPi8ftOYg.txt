Friendly employees, clean restaurant, decent prices... So why 2 stars? If you live in Arizona you probably have had authentic or even homemade Sonoran Mexican food.  There is a reason at lunch today it was filled with "gringos". The food was gross in my opinion, didn't taste fresh or made from scratch. Rice & beans had no flavor. Gobs of melted cheese (not real Mexican cojita/queso fresco) was smothered all over the food, with a side of limp yellow iceberg lettuce. $1.99 margarita was cheap for a reason, it was all ice and pre made mix, could not taste the tequila. Some people enjoy this trash, I on the other hand have higher expectations. This was my 5th visit. I'll stop giving this place anymore chances.
