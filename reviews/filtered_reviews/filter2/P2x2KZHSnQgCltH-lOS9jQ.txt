We were asked by our server if we wanted anything off the 2 for $12 app menu. Sure, we said. Any margaritas? Sure. But when our bill came, we had been charged $7 for each app and the margaritas had been upgraded without asking or offering. To try and up our check without asking for a few bucks, even if he heard we were both servers, he should be ashamed. The food was good, which is why I'm giving it 2 stars. I won't be back.
