Meh....

Yesterday, my fella and I had planned to go to a reopening of a popular restaurant, but they've pushed their opening back, so we had to find something else for dinner.

We finally decided on Ricardo's, which I'd never had.  

Walking in, the inside is a little run down, and shabby.  Its a little on the dark side, and each booth in the bar area we were seated in had a TV IN the booth.  I don't like this...If I wanted to watch TV, I'd sit at the bar.  

We got there in time for happy hour, and so I had a "small" regular margarita for $4.50.  
This wasn't small!  I'm glad I only got the small, because it was so big I couldn't finish it.  This was my favorite part of the evening.  It was a good, strong margarita, and I'd go back for happy hour just to have a couple of these, for sure.  

For dinner, I ordered the nachos, no meat (also on the happy hour menu: $7).  
Morgan had the combo carnitas taco and shredded beef enchilada, served with rice and beans. 

Meh. 

The portions were enormous.  I ate a ton of food, and it looked like I didn't touch my nachos.  The waitress actually came over and said "You didn't like them?"  No...there's just WAY too much food on the plate!  They tasted ok, but I've had better at Qdoba. 

Morgan wasn't impressed with his, either.  The enchilada was good, but we make better at home.  The carnitas taco was bland.  

Service was awkward too...our waitress was nice, but had 0 personality.  She disappeared at random times, and the checked on us twice within about 3 minutes...space it out! Its ok to let us eat for a minute.  Really.

Food was pricey for the quality.   I don't know that I'd come back for anything other than a margarita during happy hour.
