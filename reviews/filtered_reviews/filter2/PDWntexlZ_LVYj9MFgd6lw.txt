I couldn't agree more with some of the reviews I've seen on here. This is not the Wahoo's you grew up with in Cali. The fish is very dry and the green sauce stuff they serve is like some gross watery sour cream and herb combo. 

I've been here a few times for drinks and there is a particular bartender that's horrible. (Sorry, I don't remember her name!) When watching a fight in a mostly empty bar she came on shift and turned down the volume on the television and then changed the channel to some reality show. I asked for it back on and was ignored.  

I've also been here on at least two other nights where her service was lacking because she was too busy chatting up a customer to serve us or even bring us the bill to get paid. I finally had to tell her we were walking out without paying to get her to do her job.

Avoid this location unless you want a mediocre fish taco with crappy service.
