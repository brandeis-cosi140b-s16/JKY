If you've ever been to Mexico and experienced a real fish taco (which usually runs around 50Â¢) then you know Cabo is a giant poser.

They charge mucho dollars for crappy food. The seafood is ALWAYS overcooked. Seafood is delicate and should be flaky and light. Not fried hard as sh!t. I've been there thrice, all for lunch, and it's very inconsistent. Sometimes bland, sometimes very salty, sometimes seared, sometimes forgotten on the stove. The tacos are always drowning in some mystery grease, everything gets some kind of f%@king mayonnaise on it, and the complementary salsa is canned corn with NO FLAVOR.

The place is in a great location, with a great atmosphere, but the food is  just not that good.

Hey Cabo Fish Taco! Go to Mexico and do a work study...
