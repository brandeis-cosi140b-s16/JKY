Paco's Tacos, like most Mexican restaurants, brings you out a big bowl of chips and salsa to start with.  This is great, but unfortunately the salsa tastes like marinara sauce spiked with hot sauce..  We tried the No Name Margarita and another one which I forget the name, but it was fruity with some orange flavor.  We honestly did not like either flavors but they were definitely strong.

The homemade guacamole is pretty good and we ordered quesedillas which were good as well, but the food came out much too quickly.  If we wanted fast food we would have gone to taco bell!  We were hardly able to enjoy the chips and drinks before they brought our meals out.

Overall I really don't recommend, there are much better Mexican places out there!
