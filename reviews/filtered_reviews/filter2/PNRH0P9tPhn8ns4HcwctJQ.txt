Warning! Look at your bill carefully and compare the prices to the ones on the menu. 
I went into this restaurant on a whim for lunch because I was in the area. They gave me a menu with fairly expensive items so I asked for the lunch specials and was told that was the lunch menu! 
Not wanting to take out a 2nd mortgage, I just ordered some albondigas soup (my favorite).  The menu said it was $5.95 for a bowl which is actually one of the few reasonably priced items on the menu. It took some time to be brought out even though there were only a few customers in the place. To be honest, I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because of the soup. It was fresh and delicious. probably one of the best I've had. It's when I got the bill that the problem began. I checked my bill to pay and noticed that the price of the soup on the bill was $6.95, a dollar more than the menu stated. I asked to see the menu again just to make sure. I called the hostess over and pointed out the mistake. It took almost 15 minutes to come back with a new bill. This bill was computer generated which means the price in the system is wrong.  Maybe this is an anomaly with this one item. I can't be sure. Again, the food was great!
