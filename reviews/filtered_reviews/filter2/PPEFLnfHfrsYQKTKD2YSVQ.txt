Bland and boring.  Whats with the fries?! No body in the world wants mexican food with fries.  A bad representation of Phoenix in an impressionable location.  Besides the sub average flavor the tradion of bad attitudes and slowness from the employees carries on from the 16th st location to the airport.  Never again Barrio. Dont believe the hype.
