I'll start this review by saying we've heard from friends that this Mexican restaurant was a great place to get a good margarita bigger then your head and some decent Mexican fare. As we're always looking to try out new restaurants, we thought this would become one of our new favs...and decided in the end that, sadly, it will not be on our list to revisit. 

Now, I will say I did not try the margarita (it was a "school night," so-to-speak), so I can't vouch for how delicioso it is. What we did end up ordering was the guacamole, which underwhelmed, and both the enchiladas and the tacos were mediocre. The service was quite slow (not sure if that was due to a lack of sufficient staffing or the fact that our server was more interested in the telenovela then us). 

Overall, would say for a stellar Mexican restaurant experience, we'll head back to Cantina 1511. Prices are a bit higher, but food, drinks, and service are always fantastic.

UPDATE: shortly after posting this I received a note from the manager asking for additional details and requesting that we give Three Amigos one more try. On that alone we will go back and see if our experience was just a fluke. Responding to my review that quickly makes me think that they ARE serious about customer service. I'll post again once we've had a chance to check it out.
