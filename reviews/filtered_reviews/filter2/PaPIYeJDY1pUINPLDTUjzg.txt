The two stars are for the good waitstaff and the fantastic decor.  The food was not so good.    I got a pork fundido and dinner companion got the steak fundido.   The meat in both was awful.  Pork was hard and chewy. According to companion the steak was not much better than hamburger.  And beans and rice came with the meal.however there were literally just 2 teaspoons worth of beans.  Although the decor is nice and the waitstaff were good the food not too good.  Would not go back
