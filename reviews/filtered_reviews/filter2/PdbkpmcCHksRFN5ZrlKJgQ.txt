Ewwwww


Are people just giving this place good reviews bc they want to pretend like they're super cool and are totally down with hole in the wall places in the hood?? 

Bc this was seriously nast. We ordered the queso w chorizo and that was bomb, I'll give them that.

Our food came out, I had one bite of my chilaquiles and was like ready to spit it out. The green sauce was creepy and the steak was very off in flavor and not seasoned at all. I asked for a to go box and boxed up the steak to feed my dogs. 

My friend ordered their torta. She was like 'I can't tell if I don't like this bc it's gross or bc I'm full' I tasted it and was like 'bc it's gross.' she called me today to tell me she tried eating it for breakfast but threw it out bc it was nasty. 

We'll be sticking to the torta from Gallo Blanco, bc even though their service sucks, at least their torta is amazeballs. 

Seriously some of the grossest food I've tasted. The staff was friendly and the place was clean and packed. I just personally find the food super nasty.
