No. Just, no. 

We went on a slow day and had no idea what we were in for. Our server was nonexistent for the first 30 minutes, when she finally did show she took another 30 to get our beers. Did I mention the place was 1/4 full? Ridiculous. The coronas were 4 bucks which is crazy when you can walk over to Dos and get them for $2.50. The tables around us were also complaining at the lack of attention. The food here is bland at best. Just don't do it.
