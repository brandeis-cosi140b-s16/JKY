Saw this place on Food Network so decided to try it when in town. Ordered the red jade chicken and fried rice. The place was packed with loud redneck hicks with no manners...thought I was on Honey Boo Boo. As for the food...it was ok. It would have been better if it was made to order which mine seemed to be reheated. Youre not missing  much here...even if I was a local I doubt I would come back.
