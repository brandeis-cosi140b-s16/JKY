Ehhhh...

I was luvin up on the vibez with all the bat deco and waterfall but I wouldn't go out of my way for the food. The rice was undercooked, chicken was flavorless, and the beans looked like bat skat. The chimi was average and a tad spicy. 

Their bat brew was alright... A bit sour. My friend had a random ass vegetable in his burrito (broccoli). Maybe they thought the bat brew would help us forget but nah boo. 

Leaving the restaurant felt like exiting a Disneyland ride. Maybe if they put forth more effort towards the food than the atmosphere then maybe I'll try it again.
