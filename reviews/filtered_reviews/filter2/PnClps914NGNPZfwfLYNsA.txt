Unfortunately, Chapala's was closed the day after Thanksgiving, so we ended up here as a plan B.

5 stars for the $4.95 grande margarita during happy hour, which was also honored in the dining room!!! That's the one and only redeeming quality about this place.

Chips and salsa: Standard, slightly greasy chips. Tomato based salsa with not much flavor or heat.

Dinner: Ordered the #29 combination (taco, enchilada, rice and beans with a green salad.) 

Green salad: Not saying much, but best part of the meal. How can you really mess up lettuce, cheese and ranch dressing?

Cheese enchilada: Overcooked tough and crispy tortilla. Enchilada sauce was bland

Shredded beef taco: As Clara Peller would say, "Where's the BEEF?"  Not much to this taco at all and what little meat was in there, was the consistency of baby food.

Rice:  Dry and flavorless

Beans: Impossible to review, since there were only two teaspoons at most on the plate.

Value for the money: Non-existent. $13 for the combo and I left hungry.

The only reason I would come back here is for happy hour, then hit a Roberto's Taco Shop or Dimas Tacos afterwards!
