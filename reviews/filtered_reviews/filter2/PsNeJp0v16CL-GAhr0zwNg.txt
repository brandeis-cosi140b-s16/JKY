Baja offers so-so tacos, but the establishment is plagued by lack of cleanliness. Ambiance has this hole-in-the-wall feel. Decked out in wood paneling, aluminum ceiling, and brown (faux?) leather seating, they really strive for this beach and laid back atmosphere. But I was little grossed out (as Misti remarked) about the stained trashcan right next to the tables and bar stools. The fountain station was leaking and the cup covers were not replenished. The area was also littered with boxes and dirty straw covers. That aside, the owner was really nice and explained the menu and recommended the fish, and notified me the 3 tacos + drink= $4.99 deal. So I ordered the chicken, pork, and fish taco.

Tacos are served on foam plates and they're a bit small and kinda skimpy on the meat portions. My favorite was the chicken taco. It had the best flavor and it wasn't oily. Pork (I don't know why they don't just call it carnitas) was fine, nothing special. The fish is grilled which I loved. But it was actually disappointing. Instead of a nice and firm filet, the fish was masticated to bits. The flavor tasted liked old bay seasoning and where was my citrus lime? Even though they had a massive selection of hot sauces, I grabbed one that was already expired. Ugh. I prefer a smaller selection of freshly made salsas and hot sauces over this massive collection. Quality over quantity, man.  

With a little scrub down and a better fish taco, Baja could be a college staple. In the meantime, I'll stick to Yayo.
