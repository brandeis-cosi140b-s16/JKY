I was super excited to try this place.  My dear friend and his girlfriend love this place, but my experience wasn't that great.  First of all, this place is in old town Gilbert and the location is poppin... They don't take reservations and we had about 45 minute wait.  The hostess was super friendly and typed my number and name into her ipad for a text message reminder of when my table was ready.  After waiting for only about 20 minutes, we were seated.  

We had had 2 bowls of chips for a table of six waiting for us when we got to the table.  Our waiter came to the table and got our drink order, however forgot to write down one of the drink orders and we had to remind him of that drink twice before it came out.  Once our waiter took our drink order it took him about 15 minutes to get back to us with our drinks.  Then another 15 minutes went by before he took our dinner order.  Our dinner order took awhile to get made and when the food came out, our tacos were cold.  The tacos are served "family style", which means they are all on the same taco holder and if you're allergic to fish or shrimp, sorry your carne asada taco will be served right next to the fish taco.  

All of the meat tacos lacked flavor, I would recommend trying the fish taco.  It had the best flavor out of all the options we ordered.  The waiter forgot to write down a few things that we ordered and those things never came out with our food.  We decided not to remind him about those missing sides as he would visit our table once every 15 minutes.

I don't think I will be back here again.  There are other taco restaurants that I perfer over this place.
