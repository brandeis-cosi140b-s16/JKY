They have a good HH menu. Half off margaritas and well drinks, and a few options for starters. I got the skinny margarita and my friend got the classic. Both of us had to send them back because they were so hard to drink. I understand that they use fresh lime juice to make these, but I'm not kidding when I say I left there with the beginnings of a canker sore in my mouth due to the high acidity of that margarita. And my friend needed alka seltzer after we left from getting an upset stomach. Wish they had wine on their HH, I would have opted for that instead. 
On a positive note, they have a great salsa and good atmosphere. The manager did try to help us remedy the margarita issue by getting more agave added, but they were still nearly undrinkable. 
I'll Probably go back at some point for a small bite off the HH menu, but will be avoiding the margaritas.
