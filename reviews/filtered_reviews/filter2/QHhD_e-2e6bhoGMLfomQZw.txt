I went here once with a group from the office for lunch, and I liked the food, but the server was arrogant and annoying.  I went here again with my wife for dinner, and everything was awful, and we had the same arrogant server. He belittled us for not ordering alcohol and he was in such a hurry that he asked bad questions that caused us to get one of our orders wrong.

The fajitas were overcooked and under-seasoned and my wife's food tasted really bad. It just seemed like the quality of the ingredients used in the food was poor.

If you really want good Mexican food that is the polar opposite of Arriba, then go down the street and visit Abuelo's.
