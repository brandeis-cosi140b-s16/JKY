Just a shame. The food is good but service is horrible. I've had nothing but bad servers with no concern for my experience. If you plan to sit at the bar downstairs you better block out 3 hours for lunch. They haven't figured out a way for the kitchen to fire out food for that part of the restaurant. There are too many good restaurants in this area to tolerate the Rokerij.
