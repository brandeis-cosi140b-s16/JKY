I literally never write reviews but this is seriously THE worst Chipotle I've ever been to. Unfortunately it's a minute away from my house which is why I've been there a few times. On more than one occasion they have been out of ingredients. 20 minutes for corn? Are you kidding me?  It shouldn't be that hard to keep 15 or so ingredients filled.  Not only do they suffer from the inability to do their job- that is keeping items restocked in a timely manner, they also lack in any sort of customer service. On my most recent visit the cashier was too busy filling tobasco bottles to check out the girl in front of me who was also missing the corn. And apparently the one on the line couldn't do anything but stand there and bark at the cook about how long for brown rice (which was also out). Management, please get it together because this is my neighborhood Chipotle and it's not living up to how Chipotle should be!
