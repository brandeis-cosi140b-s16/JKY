Chips and salsa were really good, but beware the chips cost $1. Not a big deal, they make them fresh to order too. I had been looking forward to trying Rositas for a long time based on the Yelp reviews. My mom ordered the chicken enchiladas and I ordered the machaca chimi both came with rice and beans. My mom enjoyed the enchiladas, and I thought the chimi was okay...nothing spectacular. About halfway through our meal, a baby cockroach crawled across the table. We both lost our appetite and asked for the check. I got my food to go, but just couldn't bring myself to finish it. Definitely disappointed..
