This is my second time here after not having a good first experience & giving a huge amount of time away from the moment to come back again to give it another try. First time was a hair in the food. Which I have to say they took off of the menu (Ceviche apt.) This time just didn't do anything to make me go back again. I would rather go to an On The Border. 
Nice bar selection, but it doesn't make a difference if the bartender can't make a drink. We sent back our drinks 2 times & then I just gave up. Food wasn't anything special either. The quesadilla that should have chicken in it was mostly just filled with cheese. Hubby ordered the beef beef brisket. It was way to salty & cold. I had the fajitas which were tasty. The one great thing is the salsas they offer. Great flavor & heat! Unfortunately it's not enough for me to return.
I think this place gets such a high rating for it being in South Park. 

No Thanks!
