Uh, number 7B, no, 7Q, no, uh um..... Whaaaa?????? Just totally stupid. And I have tried this place 3 times to try and figure out why the hell anyone would want to eat chinese mexican fusion???? I even brought people with me to try to figure out if it is me..... Its not, this place blows on all levels.... That allspice or whatever they put in the jerk chicken that everyone raves about is terrible...... An now its chinese mexican jamaican fusion?????? WTF is this crap? Fried rice and black beans??????
