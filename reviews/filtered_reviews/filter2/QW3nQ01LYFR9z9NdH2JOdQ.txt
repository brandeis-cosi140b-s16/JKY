I have been to Emilianos 3-5 times over the past several years. The service, food, and margaritas have always been OK or good, never terrible or great. I dined here most recently on Friday night with friends and ordered a margarita and chicken quesadilla. The margarita was all right, but I believe that Mad Mex serves up a much tastier margarita. The chicken quesadilla was pretty tasty, though I personally prefer slices of chicken to the shredded chicken in these quesadillas. Our waiter was nice enough but could have offered better service. Our chips and salsa were quickly eaten but never replaced, and I was never offered a second margarita. Overall, I don't dislike this restaurant but would select to dine at a Mad Mex instead any day.
