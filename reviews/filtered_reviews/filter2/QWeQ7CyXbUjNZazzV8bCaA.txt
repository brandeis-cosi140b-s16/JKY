Haven't been here in almost 20 years, thought I'd give it a second try. Wish I hadn't. It took forever for the food to come out, and the salsa tasted like ketchup. Our server was nice. When the food finally came out, they forgot components of some of the dishes. Street tacos were boring - had better tacos at any of the 'bertos. My buddy had the fajitas and he said the chicken was so dry and tasteless he couldn't even eat it. To boot, it was way overpriced, probably because they are connected to the Arizona Grand resort. Half my party got sick later that night. Horrible experience, and not much has changed in 20 years.
