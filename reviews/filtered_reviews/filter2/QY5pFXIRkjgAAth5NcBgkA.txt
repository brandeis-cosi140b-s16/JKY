Not impressed.  I had the huevos rancheros with green sauce.  The sauce was bland - tasted like it came out of an 89 cent can.  Eggs were overcooked, and the potatoes were greasy.  With all of the reviews I read on this site, I was expecting something authentic and excellent.  I've had better food (and I mean this sincerely) off of a taco truck.  Habaneros: work on your textures, add a salsa bar, and trim the menu down-you can't be great at everything.  On the plus side, the service was good.
