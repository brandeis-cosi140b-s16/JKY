The salsa was fresh and quite good. We came on a Sunday night and it was packed! We decided to try another Mexican restaurant after trying Rita's. We went to Rita's because it was not a chain. After reading the reviews, we decided to try Garcia's. We decided to sit in the bar area to avoid the wait. As large as the bar area was, I was surprised to find one bartender taking care of everyone. The restaurant is pretty big so I would think that they'd be used to having a full house, considering there aren't many other choices in the area! All we kept  hearing was how busy they were from the employees! I have to say the drinks were pretty stiff (thus the 2 star rating)! I should have known not to order any appetizers because I was afraid they would be served with the entrees. Well I was right! Needless to say I wasn't hungry anymore after two baskets of chips and salsa! I ordered the burro ranchero, expecting pork since it was served with verde sauce. The meat was beef, and it was chewy and tough (damn, two nights in a row)! We also had the mini appetizer platter with taquitos, tacos, and chimis...all beef. My friend doesn't eat beef so that was a waste. The menu didn't specify what kind of "minis" they were. He also had spinach enchilada platter with chicken. He compared it to cream of spinach soup. I took a to go box only to end up dumping the food when I got back to my hotel. Another disappointing Mexican food experience in Phoenix! The drinks were bomb! Couldn't even finish my margarita azul!
