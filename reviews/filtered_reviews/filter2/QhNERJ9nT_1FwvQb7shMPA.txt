Mexican food here does not deliver value for price. Luckily we had a groupon so don't feel ripped off. Chips & salsa not complimentary and just OK. My partner had the Chicken Taco Salad and I ordered Chicken Enchiladas that came with beans & rice. Portions were satisfying but enchilada plate arrived lukewarm and chicken cubes inside looked like packaged supermarket type and not what you would expect from a Mexican restaurant. Probably a better place to buy overpriced cocktails if you are a drinker but not a good choice for decent Mexican food.
