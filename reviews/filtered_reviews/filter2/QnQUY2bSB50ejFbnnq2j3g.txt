Not sure why I'm even giving two stars, history maybe? I've been coming to cafe Rio for years, I lived in St George Utah and went to Cafe Rio on a daily basis for lunch. I move back to Phoenix a few years back and was so excited when they opened a Cafe Rio here. They are pretty close to my house so a few times a week I would be here and in the beginning quality was good but slowly and surely it has become a place I might go to once a month in hopes that it has gotten better. Today might be my last day here, this place has really hit a low. Is there ever even a manager here? I'm sitting here and the place is dead! Yet there isn't a clean table in the entire place, something I've noticed my last few visits. nobody is doing anything. The strawberry lemonade and horchata I used to love are now completely watered down and no longer the yummy drinks I loved. The food is mediocre at best. This is sad. I think I'll just keep cafe Rio a special occasion thing for when I visit Utah. Here is to hoping st George cafe Rio is still what I remember
