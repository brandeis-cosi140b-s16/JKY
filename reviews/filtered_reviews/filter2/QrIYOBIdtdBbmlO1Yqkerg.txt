Can only recommend this place for a great ice cold beer but nothing more. Had the Nitro Nachos...eek, me thinks not! Poor quality ingredients. If they mess up nachos with simple ingredients what other harm can they do w/ the rest of their menu. Restaurant its self needs a little sanitizing & sweeping. I would feel bad about the glass my beer came in but they serve in red solo cups. First time I'm happy to see them.
