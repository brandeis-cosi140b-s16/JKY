This chipotle gets three stars for friendliness when you walk in the door but the food is not good so I'm giving it two stars. I keep eating there wanting to like it since it is my neighborhood Chipotle, but I'm going to have to give it up. The food is bland. At most Chipotle restaurants usually the barbacoa meat is full of flavor - not at this one. The beans that came with my burrito yesterday not only had no flavor, but instead of the tan color you expect, these were gray. The flavorful cilantro lime rice that chipotle is famous for was dry and unflavorful with no lime flavoring. When I asked for cheese to be put on my big burrito the guy sprinkled about a quarter of a teaspoonful on it and slid my burrito down the line. I had to ask the girl for more. My daughter got a burrito bowl that was also blech. She asked me that we never eat there again. The bill was $23 so I suppose I won't be eating there again because it was not what you would expect for that price.
