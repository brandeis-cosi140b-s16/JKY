I recently went to SOL for happy hour. The items on the menu sound excellent, but none of them were very good. I tried both shrimp items on the happy hour menu. The shrimp cocktail and the pan seared shrimp. They give you nothing to peel the pan seared shrimp with and they are burning hot when you get them. However, the flavor was good. As for the shrimp cocktail the taste is very bitter and it was watery. 

The salsa and guacamole were nice, but I wouldn't go back unless it was just for drinks and chips.
