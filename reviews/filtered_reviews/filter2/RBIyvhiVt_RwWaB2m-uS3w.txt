I heard really great things about this place and I was willing to overlook the fact that it took them 10 minutes to seat me (a party of two!) when there were about 5 empty tables...except that the food just was not very good.  I went on a friday when they have the "amazing" chile relleno for their special of the day, and I love a good chile relleno, so I ordered that.  Wow, was I disappointed.  There was pretty much just a solid mass of cheese inside, it wasn't melted or even warm!  The batter was greasy and the sauce was more of a tomatillo sauce.  I give them two stars instead of one because the beans and rice were good.  Even the chips and salsa were just meh.  My dining companion had a chimichanga that just had meat in it, and he said it was pretty boring.  

The only good thing about going here is that it's right next door to Paletas Betty, which is always delicious!
