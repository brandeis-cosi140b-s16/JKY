Interested in visiting a new-ish Mexican restaurant in Gilbert? GO FAST, because this place won't be around long. 

As other have described, the pros are that it's decently priced, you do get chips and salsa pretty quickly and the busser/chips guy was totally on top of his gig. No problems with the other servers/staff... pretty non-descript.

Here's the problem... the stuff you go to find at a Mexican restaurant- margaritas, enchiladas, great sauces, etc., none of that was any good. The margarita tasted like something served at an 18 year old's frat party: no balance, cheap tequila and the best part, the "rocks" were pretty much non-existent and/or melted in the first 10 minutes. How can that happen? My wife got something to the effect of "Mexican Flag," which was supposed to be three enchiladas. Not a single one was good to either of us. The sauces were not even Las Palmas quality and the filling was pretty scarce. Waste of $10. By the way- that's the entr√©e the waitress "LOVES." Yikes. 

We live 2 miles away and have decided that was our one and only trip there... Hopefully, they can turn it around and re-attract some people. Lots of houses being built around there - they could have a chance to save themselves....
