We went here last night for our first night out in Vegas. The good was mediocre and definitely overpriced. The drinks seemed like a good idea but again those were overpriced. The waiter seemed to try and get us a good deal and picked out our drinks for us. The only reason I'm giving a 2 star is because when we returned later on, it was a fun party atmosphere and they do really try to get the party started.
