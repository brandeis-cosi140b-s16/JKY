First the service.  We asked for a kids menu for our 12 year old daughter, and the server thought we were kidding, ok.  
I asked our server a second time and then the manager came by and informed us that the kids menu was for 10 and younger, making a joke that  fell flat about how my daughter needed to grow up and be a big girl and order from the regular menu.
Why would a restaurant not allow her to order from the kids menu?  
The food is priced acording to portion size any way, so whats in it for them to say no?
The service was adequate but the experience was soured by the kids menu thing.  As for food its ok, i feel the food from robertos is far superior and less expensive.  Ricardos is a nice atmosphere for a meal, just dont bring your kids.
