We've eaten here a few times and enjoyed the food.  In the past, we were the only people in the place.  So service wasn't an issue.

This weekend was a nightmare.  We told our waitress that we just wanted some light appetizers and some drinks as we were catching a movie next door.  She seemed upset or frustrated that we were not ordering a full dinner.  We each got our drinks pretty quick - but after an hour, our two appetizers still hadn't arrived.  While sitting for that long I did find the Groupon deal and bought it while I was sitting there.

Now we were up against the clock and we couldn't wait any longer.  I told my family to go check into the movie and I would let them know we're going to leave.  After 15 minutes, I still couldn't find my waitress. (The place isn't that big and there must have been a half a dozen food servers in a small and moderately busy restaurant ). FINALLY  she came out - with my food packaged to go. When I told her this was ridiculous - she snapped back at me and said they were busy in the kitchen.  Now I have $50 check and I get to go put it in my car for a few hours.  

I asked to see the manager and suddenly her English was not all that great.  I tried to show her my Groupon deal and she just walked away with my credit card and the check - with an attitude.

If I wasn't late and my family already sitting in the theater I would have complained further.  So I was late for my show, the food simply went in a trash can and dinner consisted of one drink and some bread drenched in butter.  So now I am stuck with this groupon because I am not sure i really want to go back.  Maybe the manager will try to make it right.

I gave two stars simply because of mediocre visits in the past.  I really WANT TO like this place.  I just don't know if I can get past the service.
