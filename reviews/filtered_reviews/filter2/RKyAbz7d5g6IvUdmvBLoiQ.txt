Strange layout that makes you think you got the worst table in the house no matter what table you're at.  Wait staff and the General Manager (WTF?) standing around doing nothing in a mostly empty restaurant while customers wait and wait.  It all comes off as the biggest tourist trap on Stetson Ave, even though the original Barrio Cafe is a local institution, and the prices are actually very reasonable.  Food and margaritas were all amazing, but  when the front of the house doesn't seem to care if I'm there I won't be back.
