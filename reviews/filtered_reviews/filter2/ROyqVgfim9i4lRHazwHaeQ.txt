This place isn't what it's cracked up to be. We were downtown and decided to go. We heard from some friends that this place was really good. They said they have the best carne asada but it's actually just mediocre. 

If you want really good Mexican food you should try out Los Taquitos, they have the best Mexican food in the valley. They were also featured on diners drive-ins and dives, so that gives them a little bit of cred.
