Well, my search for good Mexican food in Las Vegas continues.  I really wanted to like this place because the service was so friendly.  Unfortunately, my San Diego taste buds will not be returning.  

The Good:
+Great Service
+Fresh chips
+Complimentary bean dip
+Carne Asada flavor
+Large side of sour cream for only $1

The not-so-good:
-Iced tea
-Salsa
-Mushy rice
-Dried out tortillas
-Prices
-Refried beans flavor and texture
