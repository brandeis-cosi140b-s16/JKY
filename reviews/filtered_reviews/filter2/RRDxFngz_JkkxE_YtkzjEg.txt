I've been here a few times for drinks, but have never been impressed with the quality of drinks or service.  The drinks have been on the weaker side, and seem overpriced outside of happy hour.  I've had the margaritas, and they aren't as good as the ones at Mad Mex.  I believe they do offer free chips and salsa, and they haven't been remarkable.  I haven't ordered other food here, so I can't comment on its quality.

Obviously, the main draw here is the rooftop bar, which can be a fun place to hang out on weekend nights, and offers a nice view of Walnut Street.  Be forewarned, however, that it gets busy at these times.  For rooftop dining and drinks, I recommend BRGR in East Liberty, which offers a more relaxed atmosphere, and better food/drinks.  The Chinese restaurant across the street also has a rooftop deck, though I've never been there, so I can't offer an opinion.  Overall, not a place I'd go out of my way to patronize--there are many other places in Shadyside and East Liberty offering better drinks, service, and ambiance, and many better, more genuine Mexican places.
