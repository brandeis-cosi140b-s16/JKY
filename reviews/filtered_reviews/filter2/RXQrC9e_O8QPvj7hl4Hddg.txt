I've been to Tortilla Factory several times with mixed reviews.  The food is solid, but tourist Mexican with no real hot food options on menu.  Beware of the "Chile Verde", it's a tomatillo based water sauce that is a joke.  Drive over to New Mexico to get proper Chile Verde.  

Last night we were seated in the beautiful courtyard Nextel fire and waterfall. Unfortunately our server was more d in the girl waiter he was flirting with than our service.  I've heard that the kitchen takes forever and this trip was the worse of all.  Sat with our kids for an hour to get our meal.  Restaurants that don't work to the end of the evening are just poorly managed and this place is obviously very bad in that department.

It's a cool Scottsdale location, but beware unless you are patient enough to put up with poor service and a long wait.
