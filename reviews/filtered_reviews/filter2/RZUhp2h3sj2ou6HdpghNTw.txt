This place is family-owned. It's tucked in the corner of an L-shaped plaza by the Fry's. It's quiet and dark. They try to make it seem like a romantic dinner place, I understand, but the darkness doesn't hide the fact that it's an old place that probably needs renovating. Service and food taste is OK. I must give this place two stars because the cheese enchiladas gave me a small case of food poisoning. My husband had something else and he was fine. So I wonder if maybe the cheese wasn't kept at the proper temp. Thankfully, I didn't vomit. I passed it by laying down for two hours. The map Yelp provides isn't accurate. It's located on the left side further south.
