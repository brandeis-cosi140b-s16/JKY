Service here was absolutely horrible. After 15 minutes, we got up and retrieved menus ourselves, and after 20, we had to flag a server down to bring us water. The restaurant was probably about 60% full with plenty of staff and servers.

They were out of chips and several other menu items, so we couldn't order their famous salsa. Food was fine, but they brought my soup out with my meal instead of beforehand (I asked for it as a starter). Jamaican jerk sauce was good, but the consistency of the tofu wasn't good.

I will not return for a long time, except maybe for take out.
