Went here for dinner with a group of 11. The service was great, the food was okay. I had the blackened fish tacos and the flavor was good, but it was nothing more than fish in a tortilla, nothing special. My favorite thing about this restaurant was the basket of chips they put on your table. They had everything from regular tortilla, deep fried, sweet pototao and blue corn chips. The margaritas were great too. I'd go back again because they do have a great outdoor patio, but the food is nothing memorable.
