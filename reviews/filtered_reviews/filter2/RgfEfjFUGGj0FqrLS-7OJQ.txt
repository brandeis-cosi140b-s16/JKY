There's nothing spectacular about this place. We stopped in before the Jabbawockeez show, because it's right in front of the theater. The food we all ordered was sub par Mexican, like Casa Ole-ish (for the Texas folks). And it's all overpriced, but this is Vegas so...

Nothing to brag about , but it's worth a stop if you wanna get a bite and drink before a show.
