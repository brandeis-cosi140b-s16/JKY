Okay I have been putting off this review for almost 2 weeks but I've finally got the time to explain why my rating for this place is only 3 stars! I came here with a co worker on a lunch break a little over a week ago. Greeting from the hostess was pleasant as well as the customer service from our waiter! Good we ordered was the tacos lengua(cow tongue) and my fish tacos! Everything tastes okay UNTIL I went to go eat my last tacos and noticed a baby ant hop off my plate O_o yeah and we all know ants just don't roll solo now do they? Know what this means right? There's clearly more and to what wasn't a surprise I glance over at the window seal and it's plenty more under this vase! YUCK! We immediately got our server who apologized and told us this wasn't likely well we decided to kill one of them and save it in a napkin for management and surely she came out thinking that it couldn't be possible.. She explained that they always clean very good.. Well apparently not because these ants been shacking up for a while. She apologized and gave us HALF off our bill which actually should've been completely comp'd and maybe even a gift certificate to try them again. After being grossed out I didn't even want a to-go box..not sure if i would've wanted anymore ants to bring home (a lot of pun intended)..
