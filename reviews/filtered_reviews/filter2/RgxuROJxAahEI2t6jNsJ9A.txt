It's rare that my Yelpers let me down, but this was one of the few times. Was searching for a new Mexican restaurant just to change things up - this place had overall good reviews, so took the family and my parents here on a Saturday afternoon.

Service was slow and not friendly: Place was overall dead - only about 5 tables occupied. Several wait-staff present. First I had to stare down the waiter to get his attention and get our drink order placed, when we were ignored by the waitress serving the next table, who walked by us several times in the 10+ minutes we waited after sitting. He seemed in a rush when servicing us, not sure what else he had to do. In the car while discussing our thoughts of the place, my son told me the waiter had rolled his eyes when he changed his order WHILE he took our initial order. Wish he would have pointed that out then.

Margarita was fine, nothing better or worse than anywhere else I've had - not good enough for a second. But the food was why I came. It was soon apparent that this is a "gringo" Mexican place, so I'm rating it based on that. 

The queso dip was a pretty good start. But when I got my main dish, the Chile Relleno had more batter than I've seen in a long time. Looked and tasted reheated. Rice was very bland and beans had some weird aftertaste and were not fully cooked (al dente). My dad had Chili Verde and was pretty unimpressed with that. Others had fajitas and those seemed to be ok but not as good as other chains. We discussed in car afterward and agreed it was boring, bland and not worth a repeat.

All-in-all probably a decent place for happy hour (I noticed they had some pretty good looking specials / pricing). But not a place I'd go for Mexican food. Not authentic and not cheap enough to justify bad Mexican food (our bill for 6 was over $120, including 2 kids and one margarita). The service I'll chalk up to our waiter but definitely deducted a star for that.
