I've been to the Chandler location a few times for lunch and I really enjoyed it. Chips and Salsa were good, food was good and my iced tea was good.. I was disappointed with the Scottsdale location. The food wasn't as good, my tacos were bland (I poured all of my salsa on them for flavor.) My margarita tasted like dish soap (I only drank a 1/4 of it and no one asked why I wasn't drinking it) My iced tea was thick and seemed like it was week old iced tea, I didn't drink it and no one bothered to ask why I my drinks were still full. I feel like I threw away money by going there. I won't be going back. But if you like a loud atmosphere and watered down drinks then that might be the place for you.
