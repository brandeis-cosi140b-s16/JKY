Not what I expected. The food was nothing special, especially compared to other Fox restaurants. The restaurant itself is a nice place to go with a group of people. The margaritas and mojitos were alright, but there are definitely places to find better in the area. I was not crazy about the food either. 

Overall this is not a horrible restaurant by any means, I just went in expecting better food and drink. They do have outside seating which could make the ambiance much better for a larger group of people.
