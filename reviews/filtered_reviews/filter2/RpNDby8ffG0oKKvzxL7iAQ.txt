With all the kudos this place gets, I was super excited to find a good taco joint just down the street from home. 
The service was ok. Standard counter service, though I did have to have another person help me check out because not all the cashiers speak English. That didn't really bother me, in fact it made me feel like I was in for a superb, authentic taco experience. Maybe I was hyping myself up, but I was really starting to look forward to inhaling the half dozen street tacos I ordered. 
Instead, what I bit into was dry, underseasoned carne. Smh. The salsas were good. The carne, however, could not be salvaged. Beef jerky is more tender. 
Next time I will try the potato goodness everyone raves about.
