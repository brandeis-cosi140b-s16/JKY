I'm in Phx this week to visit the male parental unit. I couldn't wait to get some good Mexican food in during my visit, because we all know what extremely limited selection there is on the East Coast. Upon Yelping it, I was surprised to see how low many of the Mexican places were rated in the Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale area! I settled on this place out of convenience and it had the least fluctuation in ratings. 

Now there were 4 of us vegetarians here, and I did not for a second think this would be an issue. Mexican food is probably one of the easiest to make "vegetarian-ish", and most places I have been to have several veggie options on the menu. Not so for this place!! The only veggie entree on the entire menu was chille relenos, and they were able to concoct cheese enchiladas and a 'veggie plate' (which we did not end up getting, why would we pay all that money for a plate of vegetables!?). 

Between the 4 of us, we got a large order of guac, 2 cheese enchiladas, and a chille relenos. My dad and I each got Patron Silver magaritas too. Here's the breakdown:

Great:
-The guac was superb and I would attribute one of the stars just to that. I love guac anyways though, so it's really difficult to rate poorly for me.
-The enchiladas were also great and you could tell the tortillas were homemade - yum!!

Good:
-Margaritas. Pretty good, and pretty strong (had only 1/2 of mine and could feel it!). Tasty marg mix.
-Patio with heat lamps was a fun ambiance, although it looked a bit chaotic (too many chairs at our table, heat lamps scattered all over the place, etc).
-Accoutrements such as black beans, rice, and veggies. Standard fare, decent taste.

Meh:
-The chille relenos were bleh. Soggy in their sauce, and really really cheesy (like too much so. tasted rubbery.)
-Salsa that came with the chips was not that good! That's usually one of my fave parts about Mexican restaurants is the fresh and delish salsa. Not so with this place!

Double Meh: 
-Service!! Sheesh the place wasn't THAT busy it was a Tuesday night, but after our waitress took our order we didn't see her at all, even after we had already asked for more chips and salsa and my dad had asked for habenero salsa (he has taste bud issues in that he has none). It practially took my round-ish dad flying out of his seat and tackling the waitress in order to have her come by again just so we could *remind* her of what we had already asked for 10 minutes earlier! And we could tell when the food came out that it may have been sitting there for a bit; it was just meh warm not piping hot as it should have been. 
-Price. I thought for this meal, $105 (incl tip) was a bit ridiculous, especially since the cheese enchiladas, while they were good, were just glorified quesadillas (which were $5.95 on the app menu). 

Wouldn't go back here, but we did leave full (mainly due to chips/salsa/guac).
