I had been once before today and on the journey I was charged twice for my meal. I alerted the person on the phone when I called ans they said it would be taken care of, it never was

But this after noon we the office went to say goodbye to an agent going on to another office. We had a few plates of assorted appetizers and of course chips. The chips were so very bland as was everything else, except for the corn tamale which was freakishly sweet. I think most of my office enjoyed. But who knows no one really said.

The wait persons are very attentive and nice.
