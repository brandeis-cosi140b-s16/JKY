For a city that has limited Mexican cuisine this place is worth trying but it's far from the best I've ever had. The entrees are inventive but fall short when it comes to construction. The drinks are decent but overpriced. Staff is mediocre. Happy hour is a good time to visit as the standard margarita's are the best.  I like tacos and Yo Rita and every truck in southern Cali trumps this place. That being said I am vegetarian and my meat eating friends said the fish here was great.
