Location is nice and near other shopping so it's convenient enough.
Atmosphere is is kind of vacant of life. The only employees who seemed happy were the bar tenders. A lot of brickabrack adorning the walls. We were surprised there could possibly be another location bc this one looked so thrown together and accumulated over a million years.
Chips were thick salsa was so hot you can't taste it. The Verde had some nice flavor behind the fire. I even asked for a milder salsa, which I never do, I usually want the hot. However she never brought it. My stomach burned before my food came.
Food options seemed boring. I always get a combo plate to test a place out. I ordered a beef hardshell taco and a chicken enchilada. I don't know if the food was also on fire or if my mouth was still from the salsa but it was difficult to finish my food.  The beans and rice were good. not spicy. My son (15 months) was able to eat them just fine. My stomach was burnin' before we even left and I'm no stranger to mexican or spicy food.
Our server was sweet but seemed terrified (maybe she was new) My order was wrong and she didn't bring the salsa I requested but other wise she was just fine, nothing amazing. The bartender offered my some crayons and tried to interact with him which was nice.
I have heard great things about this place but we didn't hit the bar scene or the patio so maybe thats where the magic happens. but as far as family dining and what my palette prefers, I wont go back. For the bill they brought is an iPad to sign off on that only have 18, 20 and 22% tip options...and the waitress stood there as we chose her tip...it was super tacky.

For perspective I prefer Garcias/Abuelos/Villa Luna for chain style and Los Tequitos for hole in the wall.
