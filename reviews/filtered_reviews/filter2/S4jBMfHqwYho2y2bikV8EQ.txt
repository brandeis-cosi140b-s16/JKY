Ok so I had high expectations when we found this place. We had heard great things about the margaritas and those were nearly accurate. My girlfriend had the house blended lime margarita and loved it. This restaurant definitely caters to the Arizonians who are looking for americanized Mexican food. I ordered a chicken Burro which came with the red and green enchilada sauce. I love spicy food so this was very disappointing. The worst part of the whole experience was that the menu said to "be patient" while waiting for the food to come out, and we should have known then. It took FOR EVER to get our food, had to beg our bro'd out waiter for more chips and never had our waters refilled. It was definitely not worth the high prices and we won't be coming back here.
