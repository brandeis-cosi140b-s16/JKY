Bleh. That's how I feel about my most visit to El Encanto this past weekend. The service and overall experience was a huge disappointment, which left a yucky taste in my mouth. 

First of all, we had a reservation- unfortunately for our party of seven, we had to wait 30 minutes past our reservation to be seated inside, after requesting to sit outside. Now I know the restaurant can't help the fact that the patrons sitting at our table wouldn't leave after their meal was complete, but what the restaurant could have done would have been to come up with a solution faster than 30 minutes. We were finally sat in a mostly empty back room, with no ambiance, which felt awkward and unsatisfying. The restaurant manager was very friendly (kind of overly friendly) and offered to buy us guacamole as compensation. Had the guac been more flavorful and bigger this might have been nice, but instead was a very little consolation prize for the long wait and the disappointment of where we were sat. 

The food overall wasn't great. No one LOVED what they got. We found the chips to be greasy and the salsa just off. I did like my tamales, but wasn't blown away. I really feel if we had gotten to sit outside our experience would have been better, but really the food is mediocre at best. There are plenty of good mexican restaurants in the valley, I will opt for one of them next time.
