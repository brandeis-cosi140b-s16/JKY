Perhaps 2.5 stars.  I went here twice, and I was satisfied with the chicken fajita burrito.  It's pretty much a chicken fajita already but in a burrito for you.  Grilled chicken, lightly cooked peppers, etc.  Little bland for my tastes but this meal was decent enough.  Besides, not a lot that could go wrong there.  The green chile burrito is reminiscent of your school lunch burrito.  So if you want to know what your high school bully's victory tasted like after he stole your lunch money, rest assured that you had the last laugh.

And the chips....banging.  They do do chips very well here.
