The food is outstanding and deserved 4 stars but the poor service makes the experience truly negative. The staff is lazy and I my table had to request to be served! It went down hill from there totally unfriendly, no drink refills, no food descriptions, everything was a bother. The place was less than half full as it was 4pm on a Sunday. The restroom needed soap and cleaning, I brought this to the attention if the hostess. No action taken. Lots of staff standing around.
As great as the food was my party of 4 won't be back I will take my business somewhere else.
