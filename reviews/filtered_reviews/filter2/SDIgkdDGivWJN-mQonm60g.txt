I hate to give you guys such a low score cause the food is fresh. Service was good. But I just don't like your tacos. Guess I like simpler flavors. I don't get the salsa. At first I was excited to have 4 kinds. Two kinds tasted like tabaco. The corn on the cob was interesting. I didnt love the sauces on it but I didnt enjoy the corn.  Now on the other hand if you like gastro pubs this place is cool. If you want tacos not great. If you want an adult beverage this is a very good place to hang. Sorry for the low stars. Cool bar. Not great for tacos.  Some I am sure will disagree with my review. I recommend trying for you self.
