My husband and I had dinner on the patio.  Tableside guacamole was good, but it definitely wasn't made at our tableside.  Service was just so-so and when we told the manager there were mice at our feet, he seemed unconcerned as he moved us to a different table and then disappeared.  Food was okay but the whole experience was gross.
