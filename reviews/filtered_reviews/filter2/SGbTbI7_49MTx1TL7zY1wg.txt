Like my first visit a few months ago, service was lacking once again (-1) The waiters (both times) had to return to our table to ask what we had just ordered a few minutes earlier. Our half dozen oyster appetizer was fresh. The ceviche de Camaron was flavorless (-1), and the Lengua was a bit overcooked (-1). The ambience is good though, beautiful decor. Wait staff just seems to disappear a lot!
