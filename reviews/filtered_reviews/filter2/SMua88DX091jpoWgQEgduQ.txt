Ok. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing here. I dunno. But I was NOT pleased. Not at all. 

I am from LA and I know Mexican. And this place is not Mexican. It's something like what Midwesterners want Mexican to be. I knew I was in trouble when I saw that the the Fish tacos were served with a Chipotle Mayo type thing. Yuck. That is not authentic. 

So I ordered the Sopa de Tortilla. A dish I love to order in Mexican restaurants. Not terrible, but not balanced and it really tasted only like a bowl of chili. Eh.

Then my friend ordered the 6 taco platter and I tried the Rajas and Mushroom tacos. Blech. No flavor. Plus (and I hate when restaurants do this) although the menu stated the Rajas Tacos came with Queso Fresco (versus just queso), when it came it was melted Jack Cheese.   That is not Queso Fresco. I guess they don't expect people to know the difference!

The only reason I am giving the 2 stars and not 1 is because their house  made salsa was pretty good. Thank god for that, because it was the only way to flavor the tacos!
