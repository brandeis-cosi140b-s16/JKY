Instead of writing a review for a chain that I'm familiar with and typically enjoy, I'm going to write the dialogue of my experience.  Setting the stage with me and 3 colleagues waiting in line:

Colleague 1:  I'd like a beef burrito
Loud guy behind counter:  We don't have beef!  We have steak!
Colleague 1:  Okay..steak.  Corn tortilla please
Loud guy behind counter:  Steak burrito!  Beans?
Colleague 1:  Yes, black beans.  Corn tortilla please
Loud guy:  Hot or mild?
Colleague 1:  I'll have that one (points), the fresh salsa
Loud guy:  That's pico de gallo!
Collague 1:  Okay..that
(by the way...he ended up with a flour tortilla anyway)

Loud guy:  NEXT!  (extra loud as if I'm not standing 29 inches in front of him)
Me:  Can I have salmon in a burrito?
Loud guy:  YES!  We have salmon!
Me:  Okay...salmon burrito please
Loud guy:  salmon-ay por favor!  (I'm pretty sure Spanish for salmon is salm√≥n...no "ay")
Loud guy:  BEANS?!!!!!
Me:  yes, white please
Loud guy:  WE DON'T HAVE WHITE BEANS, WE HAVE
Me, interrupting loud guy:  PINTO BEANS! (and I pronounced it PEEN-toe in my best Spanish accent)
Loud guy:  Hot or mild (now not as loud)
Me:  Salsa roja and pico de gallo
Loud guy:  wet style right?  (then just pours enchilada sauce on before I answer)
Me:  Sure (as if I have a choice at this point)

By then, I think he was annoyed with me and just sent my burrito down to the next gal to add lettuce, sour cream and rice.

Look...I get it that some of us come from culturally diverse backgrounds and enjoy bringing the heritage to the workplace where it's appropriate.  But c'mon dude... Caucasians in the Southwest typically understand the ingredient list at Latin cuisine establishments.

I like Cafe Rio, but I think I'll pass on this one next time and get a sub sandwich where they don't care if you ask for yellow peppers, banana peppers, hot peppers, or just point.  They get it.  Just make my food!
