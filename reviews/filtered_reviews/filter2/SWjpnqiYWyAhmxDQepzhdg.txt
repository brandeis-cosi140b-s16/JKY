I came here for lunch with work for the first time last week. The place was packed and the inside looked pretty fun, so I was expecting everything to be amazing.

Nothing here was bad, just lackluster. 

In the restaurant's defense, I ordered a salad... which I guess is pretty boring most places, but I think it's a restaurant's time to shine. Anyway, I ordered the Chopped Salad, which is vegetarian EXCEPT for the dressing. So I substituted the Chipolte Bacon Ranch for the Honey Cilantro Lime dressing. Otherwise the salad was good, just boring and VERY skimpy on the toppings.

Highlight of my experience? The chips and salsa were good! 

Even though the place was slammed, we did have really great, quick service. Well, except for my friend asked for no sour cream on his salad and it was there anyway.. but that's a kitchen problem I suppose.

I would be willing to try Paco's again, but can't say I'm terribly thrilled to do so at this point.
