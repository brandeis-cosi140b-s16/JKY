Service and atmosphere are a definite 5, but the food kinda sucked.
I have to believe that we ate there on a bad night with a new cook who I hope was promptly thrown out of the building by a torch wielding mob. The salsa was spicy, but had no other flavor. The chips were standard. We wanted to have some queso dip with jalapenos, but they don't serve that, but whatever, not a big deal. We got some sort of combo dinner which started with soup. The soup tasted like a can of condensed tomato soup with some noodles thrown in. my entree was incredibly bland. I had some sort of burrito and enchilada, neither of which had any flavor at all. My boyfriend's food was bland as well. The only thing that was any good, was the refried beans... and even that wasn't all that great, because, well.. They're refried beans. :P
Will not be returning unless they get a new cook.
Service however, was perfect.
