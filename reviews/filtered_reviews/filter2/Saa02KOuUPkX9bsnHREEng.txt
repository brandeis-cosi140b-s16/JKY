I remember always going to Roberto's Taco shop off of Nellis Blvd when it was attached to a gas station. Really good stuff and I even had friend's willing to drive all the way from The Strip just to get to it because it was so delicious. Can't say the same for this location.

The food was very filling but not very appetizing. The carne asada was a bit bland and though the al pastor was better, it could still use a bit more seasoning. The best thing the al pastor had going for it was the portion...the taco is stuffed with meat.

I also visited another location last year where the food was a little better than this location but didn't meet the standards of the Roberto's I mentioned early on. Therefore this leaves me to believe Roberto's is hit or miss depending on the location you visit.
