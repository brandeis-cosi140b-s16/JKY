I was craving Mexican food so I decided to try phat phranks. I thought the food was overpriced and extremely bland. I got the chicken burrito and chips and guacamole, chicken had absolutely no favor. Tasted like someone boiled it with no seasoning or anything and shredded it then placed it in a tortilla. Then the chips and guacamole, this is the first time I've ever had gross guacamole from a Mexican restaurant. Tasted like plain smashed up avocado, I was expected to bite in avocado goodness with tomato, onion, like juice, salt, and maybe cilantro.. But nope bland disappointment. It's right across the street from my job and I will not go there again. It was busy when I went but I'm guessing those people lack tastebuds.
