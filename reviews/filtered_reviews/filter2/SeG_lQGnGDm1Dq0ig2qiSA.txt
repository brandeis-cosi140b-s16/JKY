if you like salt as a primary flavor than this is the place. after reading many good things I ate there  my last trip to LV,  the Chili Verde was  so salty i had to cut it with a average Margaretta. no taste of tomitios or green chilli  lack luster rice and beans. even the stuffed pepper had non melted cheese  (couldn't call it a chilli rellno )in said this place was needing a reboot,
