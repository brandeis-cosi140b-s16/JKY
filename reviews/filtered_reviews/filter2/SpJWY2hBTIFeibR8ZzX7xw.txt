I ordered a Asada Quesadilla. I got a very small quesadilla. No salsa available. Was not fresh and who knows what kind of meat that was. I don't know, but it tasted awful and certainly wasn't steak. I don't know what qualifies them to be a Mexican restaurant, but I was not impressed. Your best tip will be to skip this place.
