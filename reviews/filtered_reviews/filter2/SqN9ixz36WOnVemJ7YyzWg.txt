Ugh. I want to love this place like some of my friends, but going to the original one and waiting for hours just to get some special "Hot" food has left me feeling not positive for the visit to this new location. 

Went on a Wednesday with the Mrs and a friend that pushed me through the door. Same Padre's feel... I was feeling better. Got seated right away and got chips and salsa and waters pretty quick... alright! and then we sat, and sat, and sat. We were in a little room in the front where the entrance to the patio was and could see all the servers headed in and out with drinks and food. I knew it was too good to be true. Finally got a drink order in and he was def hurried. no small talk, just wanted you to order. I think the the place was maybe 1/3 full. 

Got drinks and then waited for about 15 minutes. WTF! Finally ordered with not even a "Eff You!" from the waiter. At least it gave us time to catch up and take in the decor. Food came and looked better than i remembered. But the food was the same... Meh. (see other LDM review) Meh NM style food. My family is from NM. I grew up on the stuff! This is just hot to tasteless, salty plate of rice and beans! 

I would come back to have HH at the bar. area At least Padre's left that to still be enjoyed.
