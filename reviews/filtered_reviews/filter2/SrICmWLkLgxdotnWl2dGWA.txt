"Meh..I've experienced better" pretty much sums this place up for me. It's not that the food is bad, but I don't think it's great either. The quality of the ingredients seems fairly fresh, but my complaint was more in flavor. It just seems bland. And for the price, I honestly feel I can go somewhere else and get more bang for my buck.

I know lots of people who love this place, but it just isn't for me. I've tried this place a few times and never felt impressed, so I give it 2 stars because I don't plan on going back.
