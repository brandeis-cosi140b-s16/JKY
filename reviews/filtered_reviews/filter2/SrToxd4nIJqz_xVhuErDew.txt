On my return trip to Casa don Juan I have been somewhat let down. My first visit seemed magical and quirky because I went to eat Mexican on St. Patrick's Day. But alas, it was not meant to be!

On a Monday afternoon I took an out of town friend to the thrift/antique store district downtown. We just wanted to kill some time and thought it would be fun. Well, we also were in need of a late afternoon lunch and Casa don Juan was just right there, so we headed over!

I was singing their praises - and then we got a basket of cold chips. Boo! They still brought out bean dip with the chips though, along with salsa, so they have that going for them. Then we put in our drink order, and waited, and waited, and waited. Finally the bus boy came with my iced tea and my friend's water. Already my praises were looking bad.

My friend went for the chimichanga, and I was torn between getting a torta or the wet burrito. I went for the wet burrito. It certainly was not as good as I remember it. I'm not sure what was wrong, but there was just something mediocre about it. There wasn't much carne asada, the rice and beans were slopped all around inside the burrito and not very well put together. The guac they just unceremoniously slopped on the top of the burrito was halfway spilling off my plate when I got the meal. It just looked like whoever was back there in the kitchen was not paying attention. I mean, it was still good, and yes, my friend did like his chimichanga, but I felt so bad about hyping this place up so much to be so very disappointed.

Maybe on St. Patrick's Day they were much more on their game and perhaps the chef wasn't being such a slop that day. I'm not sure. But now I'm not so sure I would go back to Casa don Juan. So sad.
