I don't get chain restaurants.  Can a chain restaurant really serve authentic ethnic food?  Or is there such a strict code of uniformity that authenticity must be sacrificed for the masses?
I will admit there are times when a chain place can be comforting and even welcomed.  But I know full well what to expect (or not expect) at those times.
I don't think this place is a chain but it sure does have that chain feel to it.
The food was good but there wasn't enough to be filling and not worth what we paid for.  The same story goes with the margaritas.  It was refreshing but lacked a punch.  We kept waiting for a slight buzz to hit after guzzling down a pitcher.  But nada.  You can image what we said when our waitress asked if we wanted another.
Overall, it's as good if not slightly better than Chevy's or El Torito. 
And until I yelp or find something better, I'm sticking with Roberto's Taco Shop.
