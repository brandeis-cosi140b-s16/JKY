So here's the breakdown:

Service: Average. We sat with empty drinks and an empty chip basket for longer than I'd like. 

Food: I had fish tacos (I get them at so many places that I can get a feel for a place just from the tacos!). The tacos were large and filled with tasty things. The fish was salmon, which I've never encountered in a fish taco before, but it was good. Rice and black beans were tasty. This probably would have gotten another star had it not been for Boyfriend's food. He got the "Grande Chimichanga". First off, not so grande. His words: "it was a greasy tortilla filled with badly seasoned ground beef." He said he would have been better off at Taco Bell. Ouch. Now, never in the 5+ years of our relationship have I seen him stop eating a meal before he was full. Today, that changed. He left probably a quarter of the chimichanga on the plate; he said it was just too bad to finish. Frankly, I'm still a bit shocked. 

The lesson: "You're better off at Taco Bell."
