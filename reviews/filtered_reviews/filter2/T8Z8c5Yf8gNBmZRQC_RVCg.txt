The service was weak (it took a long time to be served even though that place was three quarters empty and our server was not very responsive to our needs), the food was not that great , even the guacamole tasted like store bought . Good tortilla chips but the salsa was weak. The tacos were fair, some of the food tasted under done. The atmosphere was fair to poor. I would not recommend this place.
