Oiliest corn chips I've had in years, and the two salsas had no spice level to speak of, including the "hot sauce".  Huevos Rancheros was a rather small portion for the price, and the hasbrowns were simple shredded variety.  Tortillas were nice, and wife's burrito was much better.  They are full service now, and the service was just ok.  Place looks sketchy and somewhat run down during the day.  I probably would not have stopped if I hadn't heard a few good things about this restaurant.
