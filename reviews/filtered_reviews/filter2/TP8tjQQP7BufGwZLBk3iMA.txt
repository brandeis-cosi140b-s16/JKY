I was hesitant to go since I'm not really into chains, but when the guacamole calls theres nothing you can do to stop it.
Service was good except for the fact our first server told us he was leaving and had a bad day before he asked up for our drink order...  I got the barbacoa tacos, the meat was dry, but I get what they were going for. I asked for spicy salsa and the server brought me out 3 different kinds to try, so that was nice. Takes a bit more to impress me so I doubt I'd go back, unless they have a tequila happy hour!
