I was really looking for a strong margarita and didn't find it here. The first sip was, but that was all.. 
The food is rather generic. Nothing really stood out to me here.
The service was very slow, had to wave someone down to get another drink. 
It's typical Mexican fare. No real authentic flare outside if the Mexican music blaring. 
Won't be back. It wasn't terrible, it just didn't stand out as anything to come back for.
