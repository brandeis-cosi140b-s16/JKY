Tubbs is a mixed bag, drinks are ok, service is usually ok and the food is ok.

In particular the new menu is an improvement with several of the new tacos (BBQ comes to mind, as does the Friday fish fry) being tasty but the salsa and chips are really crummy.  Even the generic-ish midwestern Mexican places in Madison have better salsa and the chips are unappetizing with a strange lime-popcorn flavor.  The salsas were always not to my taste but the quality really seems down on them now.

If I recall the ambiance used to be Austin funky, alt country bands, records on the walls.  Recently it was more generic.

Pretty much the place to go when you want an interesting Taco and don't feel like driving out of the near east side.
