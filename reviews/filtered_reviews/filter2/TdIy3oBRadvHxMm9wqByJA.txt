I tried this place for the first time this past weekend for lunch and it was just ok. I might be spoiled with really good taquerias here in the bay area but the food was as good as mexican food at apple bees or something.

The salsa and chips they served were good. nothing special to write about except they were bottomless so it was a good appetizer. We did order some guac which was nice and smooth texture wise and stated creamy. It was pretty delicious.

A friend and I split / shared an order of shrimp enchiladas and an order of crab enchiladas. They were served wit refried beans, rice, and 2 enchiladas. The portions for rice and beans was small but they tasted just fine. The shrimp and crab meat was delicious but i think what threw me off was the favor of the enchilada sauce. The sauce tasted "off" but I can't really pin point what it was about the sauce but it just didn't taste right. 

Comparing this place to almost any hole in the wall taqueria, this place had ok Mexican food but it was no where near the quality of a taqueria but costs double the price. 

Overall, If you really want some mexican food, find a taqueria near by off the strip and you'll be better off. If you're really hungry and you're in the aria, I'd just go over to the aria cafe and order something there. While its not much cheaper, you have better options  for food at the cafe. Even if they had mexican food at the Aria Cafe, I'm sure the quality would be the same as Javier's.
