Taco Tueaday... Cool, clean taco shop'ish atmosphere - good for those who are skittish of your typical taco 'slop shops'.  Had two Carne Asada, one chicken and one Al Pastor. Though all were fairly unremarkable the chicken and Carne Asada were by far my least favorite. Very bland. Bummed as a good buddy highly recommended. Probably won't return.
