Maybe I'm just a crazy New Englander, but this place was nothing special...

First of all, they serve stale bread and some sort of roasted red pepper spread at your table.  Sorry, but it just doesn't go...

Inside is super loud...they've got speakers all over the place and it's not a big restaurant.  Live music is a nice thought, but it's literally deafening. 

Food is just not good.  Tacos were bland.  Table side guacamole has a "kitchen sink" recipe and uses avacados that aren't even ripe.  Also had a vegetarian dish that was just roasted veggies covered with a ton of cheese.  

Service was not good either.  Waiter forgot what we ordered (writing stuff down would be OK by me...) and stuff came out slow.  

Definitely wouldnt go back...
