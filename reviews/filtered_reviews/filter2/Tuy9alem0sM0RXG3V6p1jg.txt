I was recommended  to come  by on Tuesday for tacos . Not sure if our waitress was tired from a long shift .but we wete never given silverware we had to ask more than once for them and napkins .we had a table for 4 and added two more maybe that was the reason for the lackluster service received . We also noticed That maybe it was because we were not Caucasian that our service was not  that great .seems  like the tables with the Caucasian  had silverware and faster service .The young lady  who sat us and took our reservation was great and the bus boys were on there game . I was disappointed  because  I am  latino and expected a bit more but I will give it another chance just with a male waiter.work on your wait staff .
