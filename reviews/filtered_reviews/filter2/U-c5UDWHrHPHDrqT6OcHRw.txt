Got a $14 chile relleno (vegan so just veggies) and that's ALL you get for $14!!! A huge plate with a tiny veggie chile relleno in the middle and a small side of beans. I expected a full meal for that price. 

Also ordered 2 veggie tacos. They were fine in terms of taste but it was literally only 4 bites worth! They use the tiny corn tortillas. For $3.50 each I would save $1 and come on taco Tuesday. 

Table side guac is 1 avocado with tons of tomatoes for $10. 

Save your money and go down the street to Joyride Taco Shop. Waaaaaay better food for the $$$!  This place is a rip off for mediocre mexican food. I won't be back.
