I've heard awesome things about this place so my husband and I tried it yesterday. First off i'd like to say that Samantha, our cashier was really abrasive and seemed pretty peeved that we didn't know what to order, but hey it was our first time there! We both had one of each taco, (steak and chicken). The steak was really tasty, HOWEVER the chicken was salty. The tacos are about the size of my palm and are $1.80 each. Not a bargain if you ask me. Their salsa is very fresh and tastes amazing, but the guacamole at the salsa bar is just pureed avocado with a lot of water. Beans were great and you get a lot for your money too! Two stars for poor customer service and a pretty good steak taco. Overall I personally wouldn't recommend it. 

Peace.
