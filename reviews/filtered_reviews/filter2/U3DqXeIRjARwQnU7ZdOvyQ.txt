Sorry..not much here I can give a plus to.. I do like the margaritas..so I can give a star or two.. I do love the chips...the little dips that you get prior to ordering...My one thing is that.. is that the dip crock is so small..that you have to continuously try and catch the waiter...I a bit of a chip muncher..salsa, and dip lover... So I have had the cheese crisp with a few extras on the side.. My parents were here and wanting some 'good ' mexican food... My mom, hated it... oops! Guess Ill pay attention to yelp before I do that again... I like that the food is New Mexican 'style' with green chile type dishes...but I have yet to be impressed with the enchiladas...or the tacos...or the food, in general. Service is blah..and inconsistent... starting from the moment you walk in to the 'dressed up' hostesses with attitude..but margs are good, strong..and the chips and salsas are good.. not great..good
