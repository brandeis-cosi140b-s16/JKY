I wanted to watch some football games while eating and ESPN zone was SUPERPACKED, so I wandered into this dive in the New York - New York.  Now I don't get what it is about places like this that have multiple TV's and have all the TV's on the same game while there are multiple games on different channels.  I mean, stagger some TV's between different games yanno people?  We don't all want to watch the same commercials on every TV.

Anyhow, the food.

I sat at the bar and got a margarita that was pretty good.  I got some chips and salsa.  After reading some other reviews here, I'm kinda miffed.  They only brought me the red salsa, I didn't even get to try the green one!  Bastards!  The chips were HOT when they brought them out, and were light and flavorful, good chips.  The red salsa was adequate in flavor but lacked a little heat, so nothing outstanding there.

The bartender asked if I was 'really hungry' while I perused the menu.  I said sure I guess, so he suggested the Fajita burrito.  That choice sounded fine so that's what I got.  It was served fairly quickly and yeah it was a good sized burrito served with rice and beans.  The meat was not bad, heavy taste on the marinade, but did seem to be cooked alright.  The burrito itself was heavy, the guacamole did not taste fresh, and the sauce they put on the burrito seemed distracting to the taste of the fajitas.

My biggest peeve was the the side rice and beans were not good at all.  The rice lacked flavor and seemed stale, and the beans were horrid.  I've tasted better beans right out of a can of Rosarito.  I only ate about half of what was on the plate and that's highly unusual for me. 

So overall this seemed a decent place to grab a margie and a tequila shot, but I don't plan on eating here again.
