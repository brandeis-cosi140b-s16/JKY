First time, not impressed. Seating is mostly outdoors and with the weather these days not comfortable at all. Water drips on you and your food from the misters. Food is good, but not expectacular for the  prices; chips n salsa are extra. Overall it lacks ambiance and the manger needs to put a smile even during cahos. Orders get mixed up, too many hands taking food to tables.
