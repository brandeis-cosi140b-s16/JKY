This was our third time eating at Yolos.  The guacamole is very good!  The chips are thick and they are plentiful.  This is our second time in trying the coconut shrimp.  It has really been overcooked both times.  This time, it was almost black.  I believe it is more a case of Yolos not changing their oil (this was a Sunday night) as compared to overcooking.  They need new management.  $13 for 4 black shrimp which don't really taste of coconut is ridiculous.  Sitting at the bar, the service is okay, the bartenders seem more excited  to talking with girls at the bar than waiting on people who are willing to tip 20% for good service.

This place is a last resort to eat at.
