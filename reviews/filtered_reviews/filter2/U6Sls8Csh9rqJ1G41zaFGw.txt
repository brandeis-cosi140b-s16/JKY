My husband and I went here for lunch last week, as we were in the area and had read all of the wonderful reviews.  People are correct in that this place is a total dumpy dive.  But, that means nothing when it comes to food quality, usually you find wonderful places that look like this, so that didn't deter us from checking it out.  The reason for the 2 star review is that, frankly, the food isn't good. I honestly have no idea how this place has such high ratings.  We ordered the fish taco (way too salty), carne asada burro (meat was ok, I've had much better), chicken taco (bland) and carne asada tacos (meat same as burro).  We were both underwhelmed and have no plans to return.  The avocado salsa was good, I will give them that.  The other salsa, I am thinking it was a roasted tomatillo or something was decent, although DH didn't care for it. The tacos are cheap, but you have to order a bunch to fill up.  Again, not sure how this place gets 5 star reviews all day, just wasn't for us...
