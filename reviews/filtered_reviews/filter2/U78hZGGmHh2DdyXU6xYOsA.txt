Let me start off by saying before today, I've been here multiple times, and each time it takes at least 2-3 hours to have a meal. Even if it's not busy, the service is just terribly slow. So anyway, the only reason I ended up here again is because my brother from out of town loves their Southwestern Chicken Tacos. So we go on a Saturday night, it was pretty dead, seated promptly. Got queso and avocado fries to start with, queso tasted like melted Velveeta and Rotel tomatoes. The avocado fries were surprisingly tastey, I'll give them that. Also their salsa is very good and fresh, they're good about keeping the chips full. I got the Tortilla Soup, thinking it was the safest bet, considering I never like their food, and it was terrible. Lukewarm, plain chicken broth, One side of avocado, little bits of gross chicken, soggy a tortilla chip, and a big lump of melted jack cheese at the bottom. Never coming back. 2 stars for avocado fries and yummy salsa.
