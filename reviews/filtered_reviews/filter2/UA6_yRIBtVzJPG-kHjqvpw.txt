NOT FOR VEGGIES!

I was super eager to try this infamous place. I met my family (5 adults and 2 toddlers) here at 6 pm on a Saturday after hiking South Mountain. The wait was about 20 minutes, which was fine. The d√©cor was fun and festive, far from fancy. 
All 7 of us squished into a booth. The service was fair, though they handed us the check without asking if we wanted dessert (we did). For some reason this caused our server tons of confusion.
The chips and salsa were good. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas, which was just okay. 
My family seemed to really like their meals. The sopapilla was good, just simple. My family liked the flan. 
However, the menu had NOTHING vegetarian-- the beans are made with lard and the rice and enchilada sauce has chicken stalk. The tortillas likely had lard too. 
I ate chips and salsa for my meal. I was deeply saddened, as I was starving for a cheese enchilada or a bean burrito after a 2 hour hike.
In this day and age it baffles me that a restaurant can't put together ONE vegetarian option. Plenty of other authentic Mexican places are able, why not Los Dos?
I'll never return :(
