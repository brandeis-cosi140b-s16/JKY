Definite dive but the food was good.  They dont have carne Asada??!  That is weird to me...  Only green chile or red chile on the menu.  I was thinking- maybe they dont serve it becuase the meats too expensive- but then; there was tons of people in there so how can they NOT afford the meat when Filibertos has it??  Lots of cars in the parking lot and after we ordered it took like 20 minutes for our 1 BURRITO and 5 rolled taquitos/flautas... Im sorry- but that's way too long for simple taco truck orders.  The salsa cups are like the size of a THIMBLE so I had to like use a tray to carry over 7 thimbles of salsa to our table.  The restaurant is in a sketchy part of town. The gauc is good.  It was all good but  the menu isn't something to RAVE about.  Im mexican so I could have made all the items on the menu by the time my ticket was called.
