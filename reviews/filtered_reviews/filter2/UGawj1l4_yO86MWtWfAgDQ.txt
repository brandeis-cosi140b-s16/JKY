After missing out on trying the Bacchanal buffet with my friends (I got in a few hours later than they did), I was determined to try something new so that I would still have something else to write about.  Fortunately/unfortunately, that "something new" ended up being Cabo Wabo...which always seemed like more of a drinking spot than as a place to eat at.  Now I know why!

Although Cabo Wabo isn't a mainstream type of chain restaurant, it's still pretty much a chain, and the food really reflected that.  I kept expectations to a minimum for my CARNITAS TACOS, and what I got was pretty mediocre...and overpriced.  Two tacos, Spanish rice, and beans for $15?  I know it's The Strip and all, but damn (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cabo-wabo-cantina-las-vegas?select=vguZqf4mTUutzMe9wgw8Sw#J9PUAWgzOp0UnrzmnXG4bg).  The taste of the carnitas was driven heavily by their generic sauce rather than the savory, seasoned flavors you'd get from something authentic, but at least the tacos were fairly full...so yay?

As far as our drinks went, my friends seemed mostly satisfied with what they had.  I ordered the CHUPA CHUPA cocktail, which was kind of fun to drink but not particularly amazing.  Essentially, they flip a mini Corona into a regular margarita at your table, and you have to quickly drink it before it all overflows (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cabo-wabo-cantina-las-vegas?select=vguZqf4mTUutzMe9wgw8Sw#RV-cRSWcsgg5ITs4n6OcAQ).  Creative and unique, but pricey considering it wasn't that heavy on the alcohol.
 
Amazingly though, what hurt more than overpaying for generic and medicore food was my lack of reception stopping me from checking in on Yelp when we first sat down.  As petty and trivial as that sounds, I would have seen the "Free margarita with the purchase of an entr√©e" deal before I ordered, and I could have saved myself $12 on that Chupa Chupa!  Ugh...
