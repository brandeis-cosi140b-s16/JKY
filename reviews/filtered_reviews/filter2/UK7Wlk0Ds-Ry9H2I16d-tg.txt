I've been eating here once a month for a few years now.  Recently went in and I think they changed the chef.  The food was sooo salty.  Way over salted.  I know what it usually tastes like, so this was a bit of a surprise.  The beef in my burrito tasted like ocean water...plus.  I'll give them another try but they need to get a grip on this or I wont be back.
