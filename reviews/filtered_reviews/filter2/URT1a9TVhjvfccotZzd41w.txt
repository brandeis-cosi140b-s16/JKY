I really like the fact that Wahoo's will wrap any of their tacos in lettuce (low carb style) but I just can't get over how filthy their bathrooms were here. I mean, disgusting, public bus station levels of dirty (see my photo). I kept hearing my Gradmama's voice in my head saying "if the bathrooms are dirty, imagine how dirty the kitchen is," something she would always say. Even after I alerted three employees to the dire situation in the toilets (no paper, no hand soap -- GROSS), nobody cared to do anything about it. Because of this, I am not sure I will return because if people aren't washing their hands...well, you know what can happen! Luckily I had my emergency bottle of hand sanitizer in my handbag.

Back to the food: the chips and guacamole were really bad. Don't waste your money paying for either. The shrimp and fish tacos were tasty. Nothing great but a good alternative to steak or chicken. The low carb tacos were served in big lettuce leaves that looked and felt like you were eating a "real" taco shell but they were topped with so much cabbage and lettuce "filler" that you only got a little spoonful of protein. I left here hungry and disgusted with the lack of cleanliness.
