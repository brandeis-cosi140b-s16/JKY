I have been to this location one time before and the experience was not memorable, so we decided to try it again.  We walked into the bar and at least half the stools were empty, but there were still checks and dirty plates scattered all over.  It took about 10 minutes for that to be cleaned up.  When I received the chicken taco I ordered, the meat wasn't even lukewarm.  I asked for a new taco and got beef instead because I was worried that the chicken was being held at the wrong temperature and I didn't want to chance getting sick.   My hubby's dish was barely hot as well.  The cheese enchilada was also lukewarm.    The server delivering our plates told us to be careful because the plates were hot, but when we touched them, the plates weren't really hot at all.  Eating at this Macayo's was a so-so experience at best.
