So, i dont expect much when i dine at these types of establishments and try not to make habbit out of it but when its late and you are hungry you find Fiesta Burrito.  I keep it really simple with a chicken burrito but EVERY time i order the same thing i get something different, and get upcharged for someting...Staff is pretty cool but when i get my beans on the side instead of in the burrito..$3...or the next time $.75... or during the day..free.  Quality is bad but again, i dont expect much out of these places.
