After doing some shopping nearby, I was lured into ATS by their slogan: "Best Carne Asada in Phoenix".  When ordering at the counter, the staff seemed very disinterested in helping customers.  When I finally did order my carne asada burrito, I was given a number and asked to take a seat.  While I waited, I noticed a few other customers wondering what was going on with the bad service at the counter.  When my carne asada arrived at the table, I was starving.  However, the burrito that sat in front of me was tiny.  I'm not really one to complain about small portion sizes, as I feel that most portions are too big, but this portion was just comical.  The burrito was served with a lime wedge that was dry and looked like it had been sliced the day before.  The flavor of the carne asada was bland, as was the texture.

Overall, this was a pretty disappointing meal.   "Best Carne Asada in Phoenix" is a really misleading phrase to have on their sign.  This place is not even close.
