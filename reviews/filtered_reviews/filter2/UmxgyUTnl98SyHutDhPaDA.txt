Was a little drunk hungry, so this should have been set up as a great experience - but we just ended up disappointed. Everything was really expensive and the portions were small. Very tasty, yes, but a rip off on cost. I've eaten at a few of Andres' restaurants, and had some amazing meals, so I'm not sure what didn't click here this time. I know he commands some higher prices, but I just didn't feel like I was getting a good value. 

On a side note, the pop culture worship of famine-era Mao on the wall juxtaposed with the $50 a person dinner struck me as a little insensitive, but then again enough time has passed since the Cultural Revolution, so, what are you gonna do?
