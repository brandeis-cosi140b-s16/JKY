Chuy's unfortunately does not live up to the hype. The food was just okay and didn't seem fresh at all. The fish tacos were honestly the worst fish tacos I've ever had. The appetizer sampler wasn't bad but wasn't any better than a South Blvd Mexican restaurant. Chips and salsa were good. Our server was very nice and tried really hard but I would be surprised if she had ever worked in a restaurant before. Overall not a great experience.
