We stopped here for the first time after a day on the boat and none of us were in the mood to be picky.  Even with this being the case, we were all quite disappointed with the food here.  This certainly is NOT Tex-Mex.  It's the type of mexican food you would expect from a school or nursing home cafeteria.

The salsa is little more than pureed tomatoes with a little chili pepper to give it some heat.  There's no flavor to it except raw tomato.  Adding a lot of Cholula made it tolerable at best.

We ordered the Cadillac Fajita's,  The steak itself was quite tasty, but it was disappointing that $25 fajita's only come with tortillas, sour cream, pico de gallo, and cheese.   Guacamole, Rice, or Beans are all extra.  The tortillas were inconsistent in shape & thickness.  They were all some sort of oblong and a little crunchy on the outside edges.  The onions and peppers were served completely raw with only the heat of the fajita plate partially cooking a small portion of them.

Spanish Rice was made with converted rice giving it the texture of rice pilaf.  This is a gross way to make rice that can sit around for a LONG time.

One of the gals in our group ordered chicken soft tacos... they were so bad she only ate 1 and left the rest.

The only thing that gave them 2 stars was the service.  Our waitress was very friendly and there when we needed her.
