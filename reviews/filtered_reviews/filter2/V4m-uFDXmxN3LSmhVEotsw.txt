Where oh where do I start ? Went in for dinner last night expecting to eat some delicious Mexican food ! It was pretty dead and server greeted us very nicely! Got our drink orders in and enjoyed the delicious Paloma margarita . That is pretty much where the good for the night ended . We ordered the guacamole and it is made table side so I was expecting awesomeness ! She put all the ingredients in and stated mushing everything around with a spoon and served it to us with huge chunks of avocado still in there not mushed ! I proceeded to try to mush it myself as much as possible . Flavor of guacamole was mediocre . Way too much lime and just tasted bland. I should have just held off on ordering entrees at that point but we decided to order anyway. WRONG CHOICE! I ordered brisket burrito. Super salty and the meat had zero flavor . They drench it in sauce and it still doesn't mask that meat taste. My partner ordered the mole enchiladas and also were not good! The drinks were good and that's about it! Worst 70 dollars ever spent! Server was really nice though !!
