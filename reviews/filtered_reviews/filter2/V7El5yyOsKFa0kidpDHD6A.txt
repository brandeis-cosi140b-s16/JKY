The only reason I'm giving this an extra star is because I didn't get a chance to try their food. I'm keeping an open mind.

This place was listed under "late night food" at the Mandalay Bay's selection of restaurants. We arrived at 12am expecting to satisfy our hunger after coming back to our hotel. Their "late night" menu only runs from 11pm-close, which was at 12am. Not only do you get only 1 hour to eat your food, but doesn't late night usually go until at least 2am??

Also, when we arrived at the restaurant, there were no workers on the floor, so we decided to seat ourselves. The TVs were all still on and the small place still had quite some tables eating their food. I figured they were just a little busy, being that they had "late night specials". When a staff member finally spotted us, he didn't say anything. We had to ask if we could get menus, only to find out that the restaurant had already closed.

They need to make a "WE ARE CLOSED!" sign.
