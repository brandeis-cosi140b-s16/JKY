Meh is right. Have been here before (2 yrs ago) and was back tonight. This was a solo visit, eating here early enough (8pm on a Friday) before heading off on a flight. 

Let's do the good first: the service was really good, the ambience the same as I remembered (it's a kinda modern vibe), and there was nothing actually wrong with the food I had (salad to start, fish tacos as main, and a few Negro Modelo's to wash it down). They also bring chips and salsa out as part of the deal - and they're good! 

The bad: the food is.....ok. My salad suffered from that US tendency the sweeten everything up, so while the core ingredients were top notch, the overall salad was a little too much to handle in terms of its sweetness (the dressing). Reluctantly, I could only eat half of it.  After which my soft fish tacos arrived. These were the biggest disappointment. Why? Flavour (or should I say, flavor). There was none. Seriously. I ended up lumping some salsa and drizzling some lime juice from my chips'n'salsa on to the fish tacos to "brighten them up". 

Total bill for this (2 beers, starter salad and main tacos) was $49 before tip. So this is the reason I'm rating this a two star in the review. Meh indeed! At $30 all-in it would have been disappointing but kinda ok from value-for-money point of view. At $50 plus a $10 tip (service was good, so 20% seemed appropriate) it's a rip. 

Not going again until something changes.
