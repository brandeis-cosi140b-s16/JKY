Not sure what all the hype is about.

Handmade tortillas are always a plus, but the asada meat had such a smoky taste from the grill and it overpowered the other flavors. Even the guacomole and salsa couldn't save it. 

The sope was good because they melted some cheese onto the sope itself. I'd forgo the tacos and get a sope.
