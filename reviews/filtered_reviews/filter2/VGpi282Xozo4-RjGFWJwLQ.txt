I've eaten here 5 times or so, the last few times because friends picked it and I went along. The last visit was because we decided to give it a try. The food is okay, and the Margaritas are surprisingly inconsistent - sometimes great, sometimes tasting of strong sours mix.

I really wish hygiene were more of a priority. On my last visit, we were greeted by a courteous young lady who sat us down at a booth. That booth, however, had sticky seats and table. And it wasn't the type of stickiness that comes from forgetting to clean a table... nay, it was that stickiness of a table, seat and menus diligently wiped down with a dubious rag, thus homogenizing the film of subtle but persistent stick factor over all these things. Perhaps I was being too squeamish. I wanted to like this place, to reassure myself that it was still okay to eat here: I put the menu down and picked up the plates in the table setting to inspect them... and there was stickiness on those too, along with dried food stuck on one of them. At that point, my wife and I decided to not eat here, and started heading out. The hostess asked us why we wouldn't stay and I discreetly told her and showed her. She agreed that it was terrible and sought to make things better, even offered to give us a soft drink on the house to go, but we declined and thanked her.

Since I am the king of not letting go, I will probably give Arriba's another try in the future. I urge you to give them another chance as well, although it's hard to justify with so many interesting places to eat in the area.

And sadly, I must say that the same pervasive stickiness was found in all my visits, but I kept overlooking it, and I kept coming back to meet up with friends. Well, now I suggest an alternate spot.

This is a great location and a substantial investment. I really hope management turns this around... it could really be great, but it is such a missed opportunity.
