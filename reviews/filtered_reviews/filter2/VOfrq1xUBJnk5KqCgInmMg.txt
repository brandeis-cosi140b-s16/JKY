Got the tuna salad for dinner Sunday night.  Asked for it to be cooked medium, came out well done. Was completely delicious, but I have been very VERY sick to my stomach since then (two days now). Was heartbroken to throw away my leftovers, but didn't want to risk exacerbating my situation. Most likely going to avoid Cabo from now on, and I'm hoping that I feel better soon. :(
