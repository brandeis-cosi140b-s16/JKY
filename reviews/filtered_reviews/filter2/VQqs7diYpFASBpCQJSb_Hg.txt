I really expected to like Cantina Laredo - upscale mexican food, darkly intimate interior, nice outdoor patio with a fire pit & lights, interesting menu options, and prices that would indicate good food. My issue with Cantina Laredo is their ingredients - everything in our meal came out of a can or a freezer bag which resulted in really stale food. I go out to eat to get food I can't make as well as home, but I'll settle for food that's as good as I make at home...Cantina Laredo couldn't even meet that. The dish concepts really sounded so good, if only they used fresh and good ingredients. We had:

- Chili con queso: I was expecting a queso fundido like dip but instead it was canned nacho cheese with a can of rotel diced tomato/chillis. This would be fine if it was HH & bar food & priced at something around $3...not appropriate to charge $8 for this crap. It really was bad canned nacho cheese.
- Spinach Enchiladas: The spinach filling very clearly tasted like frozen spinach (without any fresh garlic or other flavors to dress it up) and the green bean vegetables on the side were very clearly frozen green beans (awful). The roasted poblano cream sauce just tasted like sour cream without any chili flavor.
- Chicken Enchiladas: My boyfriend got this dish & enjoyed his enchiladas. However he had the same issue with the green beans, and the rice tasted like boxed rice from the grocery store (which isn't terrible but I would expect an upscale restaurant to do better).
- Mango Margarita: Yummy. Easily the tastiest thing I had all night.

The atmosphere in Catina Laredo is nice & enjoyable, but the food is absolutely terrible and they charge way too much for it. Had their food even been average, I'm sure I would go back again, but their food was so bad that I'll never eat here again.
