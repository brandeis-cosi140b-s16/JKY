The reviews for here are spot on. The food was okay. Yummy margaritas! Okay salsa, but not great. Overcooked chips. But considering we live in Phoenix there is no need to waste your time eating here. There are hundreds of better Mexican food restaurants that you don't have to wait to be seated and way better priced.
