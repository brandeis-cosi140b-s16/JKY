Disappointed. Usually I enjoy Jose Andres restaurants. 

The tacos were pretty good. Nice flavor with interesting ingredients. Tried oyster with beef tendon, duck tongue, lobster. All with fresh ingredients with good flavors. 

Quail Egg Siu Mai was ok. All we tasted were the mushrooms. Nothing else. 

Wonton noodle was disappointing. No flavor. 

Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes? I think the Mexican dishes were better.
