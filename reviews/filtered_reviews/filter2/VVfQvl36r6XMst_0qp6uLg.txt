The staff were incredibly nice but the food is not worth it. Not one person at my table liked their meal. The chicken was bland, the rice tasted sour (like they mixed it with a cream or some kind of seasoning that made it taste like it went bad). The posole was overly salty - as if someone took a salt shaker and opened it over the bowl and emptied it. 

The guacamole and salsas were good, and the homemade tortillas were good, but to me it's not worth a visit for that little that was on the good side. So, I wouldn't recommend it.
