It's hard to fail at nachos, and I had the blandest nachos I've ever had, despite the beans, cheese, jalape√±os, guac, sour cream, and pico de gallo piled on top. I'm not even sure which topping it was that tasted like cardboard because it ALL kinda tasted like variations of paper. 

The space is small, and you order and then stand around blocking everybody else while you wait for your number to be called so then you can nudge your way back to the front. 

I'm only adding a star because they seemed to have a decent beer variety on tap, although I didn't get any because there was no place to eat inside the premises.
