We were three celebrating a birthday and ordered at least eight or nine items to share. Each time the server came over with a dish they stood there trying to figure out where to put it. Only Margaritas on ice, not blended. My Chardonnay was tepid. The glass was dirty and sticky. Not remarkable especially with alarms going off three times and someone whistling like they were hailing a cab.
Not a great evening out. We could barely understand our server, Paola, who was not very helpful in making choices. 
My advice is to read the menu before you arrive so that you know the ingredients and what appeals to you. I would not order the chili relleno again but the flautas were great. The carne tacos were full of fat and not pleasant.
Don't think we shall be returning, especially due to the noise level.
