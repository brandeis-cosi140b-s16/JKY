This place was disappointing! The service was fine and our waiter was friendly, but nothing spectacular. We went to dinner as a group of four and were promptly seated. The ambience wasn't bad, but we all hated how dark it was in the booth area we were in. We are all fairly young (mid-twenties to early thirties), yet felt like we had aged because it was so dark we couldn't read the menus printed on black paper. Turns out we weren't the only ones having issues as we saw other waiters turn on mini flash flights for other patrons to read their menus! Ridiculous. 

We each had different margaritas and didn't think much of them. We didn't bother ordering additional rounds as we had all planned to. Can't remember the specific name of my dish, but the description in the menu sounded great so I ordered it. My friends had the beef fajitas. We got our plates and well... mine looked EXACTLY like theirs with the exception of having a small side of rice. A little frustrating when the descriptions AND prices were different. On top of that, the food was bland. I pretty much just poured the rest of the salsa (from the chips and salsa to start) to have some sort of taste. There was no flavor in anything and the steak pieces were dry and overcooked. It was truly a disappointing meal, especially given the price. 

The only saving grace in this place were the chips and salsa. Those were definitely tasty, but that is not enough to return to this place.
