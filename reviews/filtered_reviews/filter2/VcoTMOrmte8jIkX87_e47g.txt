As a local we don't spend a lot time in the casinos but we're here for a concert so thought we'd try it. We were seated in a booth pool side of the bar quickly. But we're told that happy hour was only at the bar. We changed seats to the bar and then told no happy hour on concert night. We ordered any way and had the StreetTacos tried the fish, Al Pastor, and the special with chicken. The fish was ok, Al Pastor good, chicken bland. . Nothing like the street tacos in Mexico. There are much better places to get Tacos or Mexican in Las Vegas or Henderson. Over priced not the best food on or off the strip.
