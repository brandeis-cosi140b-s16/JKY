The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is because the food was good like usual from arribas.  As soon as you walk in to this location you can immediately smell the sewage smell.  Our server at first was OK but gradually lost any sort of customer service etiquette.   Reaching over your food,  getting the bill all mixed up and an apparent look of frustration.   Won't be visiting this location again!
