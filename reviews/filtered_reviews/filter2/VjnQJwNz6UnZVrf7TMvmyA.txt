I was severely disappointed by this place in MGM. We wanted to eat somewhere different and worthwhile for our first night in Vegas and chose Hecho. Customer service was terrible. The menus are gigantic, size wise that is definitely not in terms of the options. Tables were uncomfortable. We ordered some enchiladas and quesadillas as well as sangria. Both entrees were underwhelming and the $12 sangria was basically a cup of ice with ginger ale. I've had better Mexican food at Chipotle. Not worth the time or money.
