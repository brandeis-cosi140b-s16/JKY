This place sounded awesome: half mexican food half chinese. 

They also have a noodle show where you see  some guy pull a piece of dough into noodles. 

According to everything, hand pulled noodles are supposed to have excellent texture compared to machine made noodles and should be awesome. So i was super excited about the idea that maybe i won't have to fly to china to enjoy hand pulled noodle anymore. 

Well I should've taken it as a bad sign when I asked the waitress for the dish with the hand pulled noodles and she looked at me like it was the first time she's heard of it.  She tells me the Unruly Monk dish should be the one that has it. 

Next I also ordered a beef tongue taco.

As I waited for the food I watched the chef pull the noodles and then another bad sign. I realized he never once successfully finish pulling the noodles. Half way he would quit cause he messed up. For my entire meal he "finished" making noodles twice but he never brought them to the kitchen. They just sat there. Which made me wonder if the noodle show was just a show.

When the food arrived I was very sad. For 16 dollars you get the saddest amount of super soggy noodles. The texture would be described as noodles left in broth overnight. 

The tacos were okay but you can totally have better ones in  downtown LA and at a wayyy better price. 9$ for two mini tacos?! that taste average?! 

SAD SAD SAD whether or not the noodles were pulled in restaurant or not it was an all around disappointing meal.
