I've been talked to go there for several weeks and I refused until yesterday. Being a Mexican food expert makes me pretty reluctant to go to Mexican restaurants outside Mexico. But oh well, I did it.

Let's start with the positive. 

Great patio and dining room. A pretty cool door in the bathroom-although there's rust in the sink and it's not that clean. Service was just OK (there you go, the 2 stars right there).

What i didn't like:

1. Labeling. It's a pet peeve of mine when restaurants call food a name that it's not accurate. Tortilla soup is more a Caldo Xochitl (tortilla soup has a tomato base broth). Rompope has no tequila.

2. Food. Cuitlacoche crepes tasted good but they had an after taste of burned oil. Tortilla soup was lame and well, not a tortilla soup. Mole was thin. Chiles rellenos had like pound and a half or cheese. It was just offensive the amount of cheese stuffed in this things. Bean & cheese tacos (kids menu) were bad. Guacamole was packed with onions and serrano chile, too overwhelming (I belive it was serrano). Rompope was just alcohol with milk, it tasted ok, but nothing impressive. 

The only dish I really liked was the chocolate cake. That was tasteful. 

3. Price. The price is ridiculous, specially what you get for it.

Most likely, I won't go back.

The best (worst) part is that they rather not accept American Express. They try to push you to use something else. wow
