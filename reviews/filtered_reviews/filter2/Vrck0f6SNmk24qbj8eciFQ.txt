I went into this with an open mind.

I'm not looking for Mexican food- I'm looking for Mexican inspired food. If I want Mexican food- I can go to many other places right down the street for the real thing.

I'm not judging the tacky decor or the awkward Cinco de Mayo celebration. I'm able to ignore these things. I can ignore that the food is not really Mexican (like I said, I'm not going to "Loco Lime" for an authentic experience)

However...I cannot tolerate and I cannot ignore bland food. Incredibly dull. All of my friends who hate spicy food seem to like it- so that might be what the big divide is about Loco Lime. I simply think it is too bland. I have tried it 3 times. I want to like it.
