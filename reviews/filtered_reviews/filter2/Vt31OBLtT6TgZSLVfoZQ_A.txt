I've been wanting to try Mercadito for awhile, so I went with my mom the other night. Well, I haven't been missing out on much.

First off - It wasn't that busy, and they sat us in a corner crammed in with other guests. I could see plenty more open places where I wouldn't have to feel like I was sitting in a cafeteria. 

I ordered the pastor tacos, mom got the shrimp tacos. The pastor was alright, a tad too salty. My mom said her tacos were fine, nothing special. We also ordered the traditional guacamole which was more like a mush of avocado and way too much garlic. 

The cost of two orders of tacos, one margarita, and guacamole? $60. You have to be kidding. 

I'd honestly rather go to Tacos El Gordo. Probably won't come back here.
