Lets just say it kind of sucked. Stayed at the Pointe across the street and heard good things.  The beer was the best part.. which was bottled.. not here. I do not even remember what I had it was so good. Puffy chips? Who the hell wants wierd puffy chips!? Go somewhere else. On The Border is almost better Mexican food... and that place is terrible!
