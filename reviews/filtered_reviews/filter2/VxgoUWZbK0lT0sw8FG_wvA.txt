I really wanted to like Macayo's.  The open layout was festively decorated and had a fun vibe.  It has a great location near the light rail stop.  Unfortunately the food and drink didn't measure up.  I sampled the spinach con queso, sour cream chicken enchiladas, cheese enchiladas, fajita quesadilla and beef taquitos.  Generally, the food was heavy and dull, with little in the way of interesting spices or flavors to liven it up.  Macayo's take on the quesadilla will disappoint cheese lovers, as it is mostly filled with meat and peppers.

I made the mistake of ordering the "special" blue margarita, which had a splash of blue curacao.  The server assured me it would taste just like a regular margarita, but it was dreadful - the cloying sweetness completely smothered the lime tartness I was craving. 

 If  you go, enjoy the fun interior but don't expect a breakout Mexican food experience.
