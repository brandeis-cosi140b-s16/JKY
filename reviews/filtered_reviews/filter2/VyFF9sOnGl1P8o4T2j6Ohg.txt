Not sure why all the reviews about this being a 'legit' Mexican place... because it's not. Filibertos is more authentic than Nando's. 

We went there for dinner and ordered a house margarita, a cheese crisp for the little one and a mini combo platter. The margarita tasted like soap, no lie it had bubbles, the cheese crisp was good, our son ate sufficiently and the mini combo platter, yeah that sucked big time. The meat and tortillas tasted funny, it had cheese overload and the only thing good from it were the mini tacos. Their chips and salsa are good and service was pretty good. Our waitress took off the combo platter, even after we told her not to (so she deserved her tip above and beyond).
