Go here for the drinks but not the food. The food is actually pretty disgusting but it works as a bar. My watermelon margarita was delicious and the chips and salsa that came with it were pretty good. Our meals were another story. The carnitas tacos had zero garnish and were DRIPPINg with grease. I had a stomach ache after eating them. My friend got the (fried) lobster tacos and they tasted like rubber. We split a mango and watercress salad which sounded a lot better than it was. It was slathered in honey mustard dressing. Hmmm, last time I went to Mexico, I don't recall that being a popular condiment. When I complained to the waiter that we hated the salad, he just shrugged. A better waiter and a better restaurant would have offered to take it off our bill.
