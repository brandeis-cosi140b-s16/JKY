Not very good. I ordered the daily special, 2 hard tacos with beans. The hard taco shells may have been Old El Paso, I'm not 100% sure but they sure tasted like cheap store-brand shells. Very little meat that was way over-cooked to the point that it lost it's identity. About 2 shreds of lettuce (seriously), 1tsp of cheese (which I swear was a supermarket blend like Mexican Cheese Blend), and 2-3 tomato pieces. Very unappetizing.

The beans has an odd taste of beef tallow. Not the good kind of fat like lard, but an off-putting taste that didn't compliment the beans runny consistency.

My friend ordered the street tacos which looked better. But they said they were nothing special. My other friend had a torta and wouldn't finish it.

Oh, and they lost our order, and other customers that were there as well. I had to remind them of our order and show them our receipt as they had no record of our purchase. Over 20 minutes to get our food.

On the plus side the decor was very mexi-hipster.
