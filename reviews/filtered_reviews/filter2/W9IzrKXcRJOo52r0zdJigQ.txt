I live right down the street, so I have been watching the renovation progress for some time now.  Needless to say, I've been looking forward to this place opening up.  I was born and raised in New Mexico, so homemade Mexican food was always a staple at our house.

Let me start with saying that the food was good.  The sauces were very flavorful, and I was mostly pleased with the end product.  The experience as a whole is what was disappointing for me.  The menu....it is not your regular run-of-the-mill order the item as it reads.  You build your own meal based on many different varieties.  While the staff wasn't rude, they were not very helpful with helping the guests through the process.  Bottom line, ordering was extremely awkward.  On top of that, they were out of a few things that I would consider staples to the experience, such as corn tortillas, pico de gallo, and one of the red salsas.  

I expected the whole ordering to paying time to be somewhat comparable to that of a Chipotle or Subway experience, but it took much MUCH longer...even though the restaurant was relatively empty.  My boyfriend and I ordered to go, and at the very end of it all our meals in tin containers were simply wrapped in tissue paper and string.  The cheese and sauce was all stuck to the top by the time we got home, a mere mile away.  Not to mention you couldn't stack them on top of eachother because there wasn't a more rigid surface on top of the container.  My advice would be to sell the expensive string wrapping machine, and spend a little money on some plain old take out lids.

In the end, the taste of the food was jaded by our overall experience.  I am still undecided as to whether or not to go back.  Needless to say, after months of waiting for this place to come to fruition, I was definitely disappointed with it....total bummer.
