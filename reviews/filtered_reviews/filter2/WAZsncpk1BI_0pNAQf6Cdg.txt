It's been a couple years since we've been here.  Immediately seated & given warm chips & salsa.  Ordered the night's special: 2 pork tamales enchilada style = smothered in red sauce. Wife ordered 2 tamales (1 chicken 1 cheese). Both combo plates came with salad, rice & beans. Pork tamales filling was dry. Wife said chicken with green chili sauce too hot for her. Her original margarita so thick straw stood up by itself & frosted over. My mango margarita was ehhh. Remember having better there. It was just OK.
