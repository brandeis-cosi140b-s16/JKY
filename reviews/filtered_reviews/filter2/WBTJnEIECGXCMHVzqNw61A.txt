Was drawn by the pretty decor of the restaurant and purchased a groupon. The service was good but the food was awful. The waiter's recommendation was fajitas. I ordered the filet mignon fajitas and a cadillac margarita. While waited I was brought chips and 3 different salsas, they were okay. The margarita was good - just wished I had specified blended. The fajitas came with a side of rice and beans. This was one of the most horrible entrees I have ever had. I doubt that it was really filet mignon and wasn't asked how I wanted it cooked. The fajitas were doused in black pepper and that was all I could taste - even when I added sour cream, guacamole and salsa to mask the black pepper, it didn't work. The beans were sweet and the rice bland and dry. Since the food was horrible I spent of the rest of the groupon on desert. The coconut flan was heavenly and the chocolate creme brulee was okay (chocolately and nutty flavor). I don't think I'll ever go back for the food but maybe for desert and drinks.

p.s. The light fixtures in the bar area are beautiful - just wish they would replace the burnt out bulbs. It would add to the ambiance.
