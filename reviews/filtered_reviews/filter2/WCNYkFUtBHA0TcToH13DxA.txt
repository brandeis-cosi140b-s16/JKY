Went here for lunch.  Was a little confused where the entrance was.  The entire restaurant is open so you can see out onto the street and people walking or driving by can see in.  It's sort of roped off and you walk around the side of the building to get in.  I like the fact that you can see the cooks preparing the food but I hated the dinning area.  It is very small and they cram as many tables as possible into a tiny area.  It was 2 of us and they sat us at a 2 person table next to a table of four.  The tables were so close together we might as well have been siting with them.  If I stuck my elbow out it would have touched the person sitting at the next table.  To me that is ridiculous.  Thankfully they were wrapping up so we asked to be moved over after they left.  Now the menu, first thing I noticed was that the food is EXTREMELY over priced and there are no lunch specials.  I specifically asked the waiter did the meals come with sides and he said beans and rice.  The fish tacos were good but tiny.  We also ordered chicken enchiladas and asked for double rice, no beans with that dish. When the meals came the server only brought 1 small plate of beans and rice which were cold.  The other side of rice never came, I know they didn't expect us to share!  I called the waiter over and told him the beans and rice were cold and he was like "Really" and told him the double rice never came.  The chicken enchiladas were good besides the sauce on top, it was a very sweet sauce.  The service was a little slow but okay and the waiter did eventually bring out more beans and rice but by that time we were practically done with our main dish.   The music is loud and the place really busy.  Don't think I'll be back.  The food and ambiance is not worth the price.
