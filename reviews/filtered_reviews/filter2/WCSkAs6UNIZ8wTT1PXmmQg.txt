I usually love this place. Really good breakfast burritos and tacos. However today I found a short curly black hair nestled in my machaca burrito and had to throw it away immediately and now I feel ill. This really sucks since I liked this place a lot and its the closest burrito place but now I cannot eat there anymore. I did see someone not wearing a hairnet in the kitchen, please up your health standards.
