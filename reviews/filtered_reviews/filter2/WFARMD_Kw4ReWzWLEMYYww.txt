I didn't enjoy Komex. My girl dragged me here after a day full of errands, so I already wasn't in the mood to flip the coin in hopes of a good meal. We ordered a burrito and some nachos. The portions were really big and cheap, but I just didn't like the food. Too many combinations of flavors. I just didn't like having so many strong flavors all fighting for attention. I probably won't be back to give them another try.
