A typical meat market bar with lots of people milling about checking each other out, super loud music, Hooters type waitresses and candy-like shots in plastic test tubes. The food is just bar food - meh. If that's your thing you'll love it here. Otherwise give it a miss.

I should add I hate the sand idea. Nothing is less sexy than having sand in your sandals while walking around the bar.
