Today was my first time trying Elmer's. It was ok. I wasn't wowed or anything. 

I had a shredded beef taco. It seemed on the small side. The meat was pretty dry. Nothing special.

I also had a been burrito and I asked for no cheese because I like a side of cheese and then I add just the amount of cheese I like to the inside. Well my burrito had cheese in it anyway.  I've had better burritos. It was ok, but not great. 

My side of strips were good. I really did like those. 

Also when I picked up my order, my taco was missing so I had to go back and tell them that they had forgotten that.  Good thing I checked before I left.

Overall I just wasn't impressed.  Probably won't go back.
