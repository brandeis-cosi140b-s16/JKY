The bartenders were awesome and very helpful but the manager was kind of a jerk. I ordered the nachos and they put chicken on them (extra charge). I didn't know it got added until my check came. I tried to tell the manager that it was a mistake and he called me a lier. He fixed it in the end but wasn't nice about it. Just make sure you get exactly  what you ordered.
