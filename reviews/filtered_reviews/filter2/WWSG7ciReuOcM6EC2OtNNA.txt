"Oh wow, what did I get myself into?" was all I thought as I pulled up to La Condesa.  I'm not familiar with Phoenix or the surrounding neighborhoods, so I was a little taken aback at first.  The business looks like an old house, as most of the businesses in the area do, i noticed lots of bars on the windows, and the majority of the business signs in the area were in Spanish.  THE ONLY reason I noticed this is because I'm unfamiliar with Phoenix and was traveling alone.

First impression, the restaurant is tiny! I would say that at capacity, the restaurant is pretty loud and I had a difficult time hearing my server. The tables were very close together, all the chairs were mismatched, and the lighting was really dim.  It was very difficult to get to the back of the restaurant where they put the salsa bar.  

The house margaritas were made with fresh grapefruit and lime, and that was perfect for me. Unfortunately, the food wasn't as good.  I had the shrimp burro, and it was really sloppy.  It melted out of the sleeve and fell apart while I was trying to eat it.  Plus, some of the tails were left on the shrimp... let me tell you about shocking!

The service was sub-par, in my opinion.  My server was inattentive and didn't ask how my food was.  I had to flag down the server like an air traffic controller in order to get my bill, and it took a while to get my bill back.  

This one is not a revisit for me.
