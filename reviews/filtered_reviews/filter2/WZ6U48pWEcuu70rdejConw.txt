For some reason my family comes back here fairly regularly once every 2-3 months or so.  It's one of those things where we go and eat, say "well, we don't need to come back here again," and then forget that we've said that and go back.

The food is just ok.  Average.  I like tacos, and their carne tacos are decent, but no better than you'd get anywhere else.  The bean dip at the start of the meal is my favorite thing here.  If I could order a bowl of that with tortillas, I'd like this place better.  The beans that actually come with your meal are not nearly as good--they always have that dried-out, stale look that you expect from a fast-food restaurant.  My mom likes the enchilada sauce, but says that it's not really much better than anyplace else.

The service is pretty uniformly bad.  We once had a run-in with a manager who freaked out at our waitress for no apparent reason, but usually it's just a problem of inattentive waitstaff.  It almost always takes forever to get the check, but they always seem in a hurry to get us out of there once we've managed to pay.

I have to say, though, that my least favorite thing is the giant TV screens in the back dining room.  I absolutely hate TVs in restaurants, and although I'm willing to look past that if the food is stellar, this food just doesn't make up for the atmosphere.

Maybe this time we'll remember we don't need to go back.
