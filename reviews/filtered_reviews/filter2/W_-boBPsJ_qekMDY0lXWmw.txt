This was my first time at Baja Joes and I'm afraid I was unimpressed.

We ordered Shrimp cocktail, Garlic shrimp and Ceviche. - three staple Mexican dishes.

The cocktail was watery and has frozen shrimp

The garlic shrimp was swimming in oil, the four slices of potato were undercooked and the rice was burnt - also the shrimp was still in its shell whilst swimming in oil which made it virtually impossible to de-shell.

The ceviche was average at best.

The house lemonade was lovely and the service was pretty good but the meal was not worth $50

I'm afraid I won't be going back.
