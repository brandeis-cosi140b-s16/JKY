On my grand return to the valley, I was craving Mexican. However, by the time my friends and I got around to eating and stopped chatting, we knew there would be a long line at Los Dos, so we swung by Aunt Chiladas. While it was good, it wasn't fantastic, and I'm not sure I'd do it again.

The first foul was getting there and not realizing the entire front area was a bar/bar seating and not places you can order food (speaking of which, why can't you order food at the bar... ugh). We were then thrown with a 50 minute wait for what seemed like a practically empty parking lot. As starving as we were, we probably ate way more chips than we should have and started in on a pitcher of sangria. By the way, the sangria had no fruit in it.. I think they removed it before they put it in the pitcher. VERY disappointing. 

After we were finally allowed to leave the cougar area and head to the main establishment, the food was just meh in my opinion. Interestingly enough when our food came, our waitress brought it out and then just walked away leaving it on the fold out serving tray and not delivering it to our table. The tacos a friend ordered were taunting him horrendously. Mine came with the wrong side dish which meant I had to constantly push it out of the way. 

The fried ice cream was good, but not the best I've had.

In the end, this was just a good learning experience...but it was great to be back amongst friends.
