Let me start by saying the food here had always been good.  The service,  however,  is hit and miss depending on who's working that day! Sometimes the staff acts like they just don't care. Many times I am the only person in the restaurant and when my food is ready the same person that took my order will yell out my number instead of walking 20 feet and delivering it to my table. Restaurants don't get it sometimes... business is so competitive that they must go the extra mile (or in this case 20feet) for the guest!
