We went twice and had okay-poor experiences both times and haven't been back.  Both times the hostesses seemed generally uninterested and couldn't even manage a smile.  Both times the service at the bar was slow, I get it when the bar is busy but you have to acknowledge a customer when they arrive at the bar; ie, "I see you, I'll be right with you".  The food was okay, the fish and shrimp tacos were good, the chicken tacos had no flavor and everything is pretty pricey for what you get.  I did not like their signature drinks (maybe it's just my taste) they were very sweet and had the consistency of pur√©ed fruit.
