While the atmosphere is nice and the decor is comprised of stuff I'd like to see in my own home, the food is greatly over rated (and over priced) here. The enchiladas were sub-par and the tacos "were the worst I'd ever had" according to my boyfriend's review of the pork tacos (and he's a man who knows his pork tacos). For about $17 (including tip) you can get one margarita (I've had better) and somewhat crappy Mexican food. Ouch. I will say their appetizer size spare rib Chile taquitos were alright, but they were not a full meal nor were they worth the nine dollars we spent on them. Wonderful, attentive service though so bravo to the staff!
