Mediocre...for the price

For years I have kept trying to like Blanco.  I love the decor and the overall scene but aside from the short rib dishes, I find this place simply lacking in the food department.  Sam Fox usually has the Midas touch but this is on e menu that regularly disappoints.  

The popular cheese crisps are unimaginative and shallow with the flavor profiles.  They are basic grocery-store quality flour tortillas with lackluster cheese coverage.  Unfortunately, I have had better at Taco Bell on road trips.

The street tacos are ok.  But for some reason the kitchen insists on dousing the plate with lettuce shred and bowls of can-quality black beans.  Even if the tacos come out flavorful (which is hit or miss on any given day), the execution of the whole plate is simply on par with school lunch lines.

Lastly, the classically solid Sam Fox service has been neglected.  I cant say I have been ignored but additionally, I cant say I have been impressed.

There are simply better restaurants in this class.  Modern Margarita in High Street up north by Desert Ridge is a classic example of one to watch.
