It kills me to give a Food Fight establishment 2.5 stars.  But the food was not very good.  I mean, it was fresh, but the flavor was kinda gross.  Had chips, guac, and queso.  Pretty standard, no real complaints except that I would expect more creativity from this restaurant brand.  The tacos though...I don't know what was up with the shell.  They were supposed to be soft shell corn tortillas, I thought mine were flour until I started on the second one, then thought maybe they were corn.  Whatever they were, they were so gross.  Now, the inside of the tacos were fine (portabella and spinach).  It was just hard to get past the weird-tasting shell.  I also had the jicama slaw, which was spicy yet flavorless.  I had to put a ton of salt and pepper on them.  I'd be willing to give this place one more try, but I'm not super confident that it will be better next time.  I think that's just how the food tastes.  On a side note, I used to frequent a quirky tex-mex place (not in Madison) that had the same vibe, but incredible food.  So it can be done.
