Do not bring your children here expecting to see a great view of the TI pirate show.  You can't see the girls on their ship at all.  
With that said...  My husband had the best fish tacos of his life.  Our server was overwhelmed on a Wednesday night and the service was ultra slow.  He was nice and apologized a lot.  Two of were there for an hour and a half.  
We also had the Groupon and he took my iPod with him.  Sketchy. Once is enough for me.
