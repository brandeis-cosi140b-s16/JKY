Caution: ordering tortilla soup "incorrectly" will get you bitched at here.

I added a tortilla soup to my order, and the girl who has the easiest job on the assembly line copped major attitude. She popped her hand to her hip and asked if I'd ordered it at the front of the line- nope, because they didn't ask. "You're SUPPOSED to order it at the FRONT of the line!", she barked at me before dramatically rolling her eyes, glaring at me, and getting it herself. 

After dealing with the sassy pint-size brat, I was a bit more critical of the food. Salmon burrito, $10, overpriced and under-seasoned, large portion is soggy and bland. I'd intended to eat this for lunch and dinner, but tossed it halfway through.

Best purchase was the tortilla soup I suffered for, which came with crispy tortilla strips, fresh cilantro, and lime for garnish, was packed with tons of veggies, avocado, and cheese, and served with a  tortilla to make it a meal for just shy of $5. I'll take mine sans attitude next time.

EDIT: Dropping a star. I've been back 2 more times and the line has been insanely slow all times, and there's always a major issue with my order. On the plus side, after you point out their error, they usually remake it correctly and give you both. But there's a ton of eye rolling and/or excuses before that happens.
