This place was seriously disappointing.

We waited for our names to be called at a table in the bar. There appeared to be only one server for the bar and she kept saying she'd be right there to take our drink order. 10-15 min. later, our name was called and we still hadn't had our drink order taken.

Our table service was better, but not by much. We waited a long time to have our order taken, and the server didn't come to check on us more than twice. 

The food was fine for the price, but it certainly doesn't stand out among the best Mexican restaurants. Seemed cheesy/gimmicky to me (it is Vegas, though!).
