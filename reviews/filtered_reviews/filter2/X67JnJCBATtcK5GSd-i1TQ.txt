"Meh" just about sums it up. The menu looks good but the food is below average. We ordered the queso fundido- the cheese wasn't the kind usually used in queso fundido and the chorizo tasted sweet rather than spicy. The street corn was OK- the corn was a little overcooked. The rice and beans were not good at all and the shrimp and butternut squash had only 4 small shrimp but was priced at a whopping $18.00! One would think that for that price, the tortillas would be made in house, but no, they're the same crap you get at the grocery store. The red snapper tacos were the most well received item at the table. As far as decor, the building itself is great, but the overdone Mexican kitsch is just annoying. The fake flowers in the pots on the wall in the entry could be replaced with real aloe and other succulents- that would be beautiful and actually more authentically Mexican. I did like the leather wrapped plastic chairs and the tables were nice too. And finally, it's too loud in there.
