Vegetarians, move along. No much to see or eat here. (Vegan - NO.)  I got the veggie quesadilla and it came with (actually, under, if you can picture that) raw broccoli bites and some iceberg lettuce. Mr. Amalia C got the chile relleno, which he peeled the cornflake-like breading off and then ate (said it was good), with side of rice and beans. The rice had meat in it, not sure if that was advertised or not. Interesting local color in the place for sure, and friendly staff, but not worth a repeat visit for vegetarians. I gave them that second star on account of the complimentary snickerdoodles. Yeah!
