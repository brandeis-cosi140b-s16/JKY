Casual cantina/ restaurant on a hotel property. Nothing fancy about this place!  Needs a face-lift and an improvement in standards. The food is like Denny's and there is a truck stop feel to it... Not exactly a place ya wanna go unless you need to.  The unfiltered tap water tastes like pool water there is so much chlorine in it (from the water or the dishwasher, I dunno!)  They are really hung up on the misogynistic "papi" thing too. From corny shirts saying "Who's Your Papi?" to flat out hateful ones saying "Papi Says No Gorditas" which translates to NO FAT CHICKS!!!  I am healthy and fit, but they are offending 50% of our overweight Nation!
Probably the most redeeming aspect of this place is as a good place for cheap drinks at night.  
The staff was all nice, but it needs help at the top.
