A friend of mine texted me regarding a persistent nacho craving. Nacho Daddy seemed to be the best solution.

We were seated very quickly upon arrival and had drinks not too long after that. I had the Fajita Salad, Boyfriend had the carne asada tacos and our nacho-craving buddy had the Spicy Buffalo Nachos (entree size). 

The food took quite a while to materialize, but we were plied with some absolutely delicious jalapeno corn muffins. I was pretty pleased with my salad. It was big, served in a tortilla bowl and had plenty of non-lettuce bits. I will ask for it with no cheese next time (tasted remarkably like feta and there was *way* too much of it). The carne asada tacos were on the smaller side, served with rice and beans. Probably enough food for the average person, but did not get any rave reviews from Boyfriend (did not satisfy his constant Mexican food craving). The nachos seemed unimpressive to me. The pile was certainly large, but there was a poor chip:topping ratio; I expected there to be much more in the way of toppings. Having sampled some of the other nacho flavors there, I suspect that this was just a poor menu choice. The other nachos are great (seems like the "fancier" you go, the tastier they are),

The service definitely left something to be desired. Every interaction with the waitress was almost painfully awkward. I'm not sure we will return.
