I don't even know how the food and drinks are but they can't be good enough to make up for the fact that the music is ear splitting. It's so loud that we can't hear our waitress or each other at our small four top booth. Absolutely obnoxious.  The manager needs to reconsider the volume of the music. Are you a club or a restaurant? You can't be both.  They earn points for decor. Service so far is kind of slow but our waitress has been really nice. We'll see if the food earns them a star. 

Ordered margaritas and left. It's a shame because we were looking forward to trying this place.
