We have been to the Silverton many times while visiting Vegas. We usally go to the  Twin Creek  restaraunt  but decided to try Mi Casa Grill Cantina. Huge mistake!!!
The atmosphere was very nice, but the food was very poor as was the service.
The comb fajitas was 2 small pieces of each item with ice cold rice. At $18 a plate.
Our other two entrees came with rice also ice cold. The waiter made a comment that we should have said something about  the rice right away. But he was not around to complain. They did keep our water glass full because the bus boy was doing his job. Now I will be fare, I did order the Red Snapper and it was perfect.
We don't mind spending money on our dinners while on vacation, and we do spend a lot, but we will not return back to this restaraunt because they had both bad food and service with an attitude. 
I hope the owner/manger reads these reviews because they need to make some major changes if they want repeat business.
