Our new waiter was not familiar enough with the menu to talk about what was gluten free but said he would get a manager. The waiter circled back around trying to take an order until he comprehended the four of us would not give him our order until I had information about what was gluten free - or not. So finally, the front of house manager shows up with an allergen menu and proceeds to explain the items on this very short list were gluten free which I knew immediately had to be backwards. If Tres Leches cake is on the list, its the gluten list, seriously. Scarey! But scarey became laughable when he proceeded to tell me that so many of their items were not gluten free because they contained dairy and the chef could not guarantee the dairy was gluten free because, after all, " certified gluten free milk would cost them $12 a gallon." Fellow celiacs, you know jiggery pokery (I believe that's the latest for supreme BS) when you hear it. The manager went on to recommend a salad which contained blue cheese, an iffy cheese in the world of celiacs. I gave up on the gluten free menu, ordered a plain side salad, and plain corn which turned out to be an overcooked greasy soggy mess. My partner really liked the salsa!
