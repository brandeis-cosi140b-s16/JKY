Used to go to this place at least once a month for the last 5 years.. Loved their menu and the different flavors it was always a great experience,last Friday I decided to visit after a couple of months of absence and to my surprise the awesome taste that always distinguish their meat is nowhere to be found... Everything from the meat to the tostones lacked flavor; I asked the waitress if the restaurant had changed management but she said that no that everything was the same as before. So I'm sorry to say that I won't be coming back for a while even the leftovers ended up in the trash which in my house is extremely rare.
