My friends go to the free buffet most Fridays after classes so I joined them.
I was excited because they rave about how good the food is and the drinks are cheap!

HOWEVER....the buffet was set outside on the patio where it was freezing so the food was cold and gross. 

Why would you put uncovered hot dishes outside. Sternos cant keep up with that.
I guess starving students are less likely to notice cold food??

I would rather pay than eat that buffet again.

Makes me wonder how their regular quality and care to food temps is.

Not excited to try that again.
Cute outside space, games and places for dogs.
Spring may be a better time to enjoy this venue
