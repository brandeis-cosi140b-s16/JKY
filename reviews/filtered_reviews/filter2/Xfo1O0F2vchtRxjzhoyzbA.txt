I wanted to like this place - I really did!  But alas, mediocre at best - coming from California, a high bar has been set for Mexican food and this doesn't even come close - enchilada sauce was strangely sweet, our order of guacamole never arrived at our table and our waitress seemed more interested is looking at the window than waiting on us.  Meat (skirt steak) had a nice flavor but was tough - there is a fine line to cooking this cut of meat correctly and it just didn't happen.  Rice and beans just average.  My still favorite place is Senior Tequila's.
