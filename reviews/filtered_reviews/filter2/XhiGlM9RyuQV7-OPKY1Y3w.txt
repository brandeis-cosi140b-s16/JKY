I been here before and I really don't remember much from the first time, but I was looking for a place for lunch and decided to come back.  First thing that I noticed was that they had a special running, 4 tacos chicken or al pastor for 6.99.  Wow that is like 1.75 a taco, not much of a deal.  I came in and didn't see much on the abbreviated menu.  No meals with beans and rice, just tacos, burritos, and tortas if I remember right.  I decided I would get the special and split between 2 chicken and 2 al pastor.  I also asked for chips and was surprised to see that I had to pay for a small basket with salsa.  Well I wanted chips so I forked my money over.  The tacos were not bad, but this is the weird part.  I have had al pastor many times, and for some reason this one tasted like Chinese BBQ pork.  I swear if I didn't know better it might have been.  Over all the place was not that bad, but 2 blocks either way , you can get way better food.
