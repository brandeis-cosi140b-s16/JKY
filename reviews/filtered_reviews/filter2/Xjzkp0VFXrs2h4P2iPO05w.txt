A group of 8 of us went on Saturday. The sever didn't look very happy and he wasn't very nice. He took about 15 mins to come back to our table after he dropped of the food. I had 3 tiny potatoe tacos as an appetizer and they were ok. We also had the queso fundido which was very tasty. My husband had a margarita which wasn't good at all and I had a michelada that had no lime and didn't taste very good either.
