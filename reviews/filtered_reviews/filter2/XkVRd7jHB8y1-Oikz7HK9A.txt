It truly breaks my heart to write this review. I am squirming in my seat as I speak, or type I guess. I really really really want to love Phat Burrito, I mean, really. It just isn't the same anymore and I can't hold on any longer. 

I love the location, I love the decor, I love the murals, or "pieces" in urban terms, and the overall charm that emits from this place. The restaurant is super cool, hip, eclectic and is a spot where regulars don't need a menu (if you can find it). Phat Burrito brings me back to the days of b-boying and ya know, my ghetto youth. 

It's just, what's all that charm without good food? I'm not all superficial. I appreciate a little substance and I've given Phat Burrito enough chances to love me back. Each visit just seems to get worse, and today's lunch was a kick in the nuts. 

Now, the fish taco was good; grouper, charbroiled on an optional CORN tortilla (yay) and topped with a mango salsa. Yep pretty yumm. Tortillas are grilled rather than steamed, which I adore. The burrito though was another utter disappointment. 

The beans were al dente - hard. Rice was bland and soggy, thus making my burrito wet and causing it to crack in half. The chicken was bland and dry. Every other bite was hard with a few burnt pieces. While the portions are nice, the burrito as a whole was just lacking something; flavor. Mediocre IMO. 

I've practically tried everything on the menu (not hard to do), but my heart belongs to chicken. But when the chicken continually does you wrong, whats a fellow to do now but move on to the next one.
