This place...just wasn't for me.  

The company I work for took us on a mini-retreat to Scottsdale for a weekend, and a crew of us made our way over to El Hefe.  And...it was just....how do I put this nicely?

Just not the Midwest.  All the women with fake tans, fake boobs spilling out of tanks, faux sexy hipsters mixed Men wearing tight Ed Hardy's with overly gelled hair & possible steriod use?  Just not my thing.

And it wasn't just the crowd of people there.  I ordered two gin & tonics (same gin) and they tasted VASTLY different.  On top of that, there were the overly surly cocktailers who seemed to be pissed off that people were there drinking.  

I mean, I get that you want to finish your side-work and get home, but when a bar is open (and it's not even midnight), you can't get pissed off at your customers for putting down a drink on a table in an open section.

My favorite part of the night?  Leaving.  Sorry Boss.
