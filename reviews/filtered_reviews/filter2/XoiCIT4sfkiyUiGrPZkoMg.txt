I needed a quick bite and stopped here.

I had the chicken Blue Burrito, their specialty. It was shredded chicken, black beans, rice, guacamole, sour cream, lettuce and tomato in a flour tortilla. It was okay. It was actually very bland yet it was filling.

The beer I washed it down with was actually better than the burrito. 

It's okay in a pinch but there are better places around.
