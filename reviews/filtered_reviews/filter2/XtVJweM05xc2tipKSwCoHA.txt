I used to go to this place when the food was good, so it's disappointing to have to write a bad review about it. The customer service has always been bad, but I was able to overlook that when I enjoyed the food. Now, however, the food quality has gone down drastically. They used to have the best green salsa that I would always get to go with the burritos. They must have changed that recipe...one part salsa with 3 parts water? Its awful!! Their rolled tacos are pretty much taquitos that you buy at the grocery store in the frozen foods. 

The customer service is nonexistent! I always go through the drive-thru and every time I order and all they say is "Thank You"...no "pull around", no total, no repeating of the order for any mistakes. It's extremely awkward!! Then when you actually encounter humans the awkwardness increases tenfold when there is still no talking except to ask if you want the watery salsa, and to tell you the price (which changes EVERY TIME you go there, even if its twice in two days!). Fiesta I used to brag about you to all my friends, now I think the only person I would tell is my worst enemy so I could laugh about the awkwardness they will go through interacting with your restaurant.
