We frequent the restaurant next door to Nando's, saw this restaurant and thought to give it a try for lunch, especially after seeing reviews. We were greeting with a very friendly staff, but our actual waitress not so friendly, felt a bit of an attitude. Chips, Salsa, and drinks came right away. Atmosphere was nice. We ordered a lunch special: Chile Relleno, Rice and Beans. I thought it was very bland and CHEESE on EVERYTHING, the portions of rice and beans and cheese were huge and the chili Rellenos absolutely no taste. We also ordered the beef Burrito, which was OK tasting, the disappointment was for all the nickle and dimming for the extra charges for sour cream, jalapenos and cheese etc...

OK maybe it was just the Chandler location, but we were not impressed at all, considering there are so many other Mexican restaurants to choose from. If all you care about is portion size (which is huge) and cheese and don't care much about taste then this is the place for you.
