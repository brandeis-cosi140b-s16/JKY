I prefer the El Hefe on Mill for having more space and nicer staff. This place is pretty packed most of the time with a line that doesn't seem efficiently taken care of. The front men aren't the nicest, and had an affectation of authority, basically they were very pretentious - making them unprofessional. I know people complain about the front men at Maya, but at least they do their job professionally. Also, at Mint, they're very professional as well. 

Once inside, it's pretty messy, the crowd and patrons there aren't the ideal crowd you want to be around, neither at the El Hefe on Mill, it must be an El Hefe thing. :P An obnoxious, and irresponsible atmosphere. 

The drinks weren't bad though, and the food might be good. Might come back for that.
