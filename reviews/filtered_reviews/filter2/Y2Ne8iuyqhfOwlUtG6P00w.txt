My husband and I are new to Charlotte and visited this restaurant as recommended by a friend.  The service was terrible and we will never return for the following reasons:

When we arrived the restaurant was packed. We were invited to sit at the bar and wait for a table which was perfectly fine. However none of your waitresses offered to take our drink order. Once my husband waived one lady down she responded without a smile, served us as though we were a bother to her. While we waited no one else said anything. Another couple comes inside. Immediately their drink order is taken and they are offered chips and salsa while they waited. We were offered nothing. No drink or chips. Next we were informed that our table was ready. But when we got up from the bar not one waitress showed to the table or where it was.So we were just standing there. We were seated. After that the service was ok. Others in the establishment seemed to get smiles and excellent service. But we did not.
