I had lunch here earlier today and while the food is decent, something really turned me off.  I usually order water to go with my food and when I did, the server brought back 2 water bottles (for me & my wife).  I asked for just regular water but the server replied that his manager can only provide water bottle unless we also order drinks.   This nickel & dime-ing by the restaurant manager really put us in a bad mood.  The service was good (not the server fault) and the food came out fast enough.   

We order the Chips & Guac, Chicken Salad & Enfrijoladas (I think).  The food was decent. The total bill for 2 lunch with tips came out to about $31 and that includes the $2 charges for 2 bottle water.

Congrats to the manager for forced selling bottle waters to the customers.
We won't be back to this place in the future.  I should've drove a bit further to Barrio Cafe.
