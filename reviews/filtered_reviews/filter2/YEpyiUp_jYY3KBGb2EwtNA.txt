Expected more from the likes of  Frank Scibelli. I am a rabid fan of his other establishments but Paco's just fell flat for me. 

Chips and Salsa = forgettable
The margaritas were strong, but the food was just like that appetizer - forgettable. 

Worth giving them a few weeks and checking it out again, but the location was odd and along with a pretty uninspiring meal, I won't be rushing back.
