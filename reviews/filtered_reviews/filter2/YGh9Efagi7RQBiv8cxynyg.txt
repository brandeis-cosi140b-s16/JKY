This place is very meh for me. I went there the other night for the first time and was severely unimpressed with the food. One of my favorite things about going to a Mexican restaurant is the chips and salsa, but was soooooo let down with how bad theirs was. Just a nasty chip with a dark red sauce that you can tell is just chili powder. My GF and I tried several items on two combo plates, and nothing stood out. Just all very mediocre. 

The one good thing about our experience was the service. The service was amazing. The guys watching our group were on their game, and really impressed us. So if I could, I would give 5 stars for service and 1 star for food. If I could give my rating an over all 2.5 stars I would.
