I have tried the Chapala's on the west side of town before it closed several years ago and I didn't remember it being too memorable. On this occasion, my fella insisted we try this place and I gave in.

Our server was friendly and we ordered the carne asada to share and snacked on chips and salsa while we waited. The chips weren't anything special and I found the salsas to be particularly unappealing. They were watery and had a sweetness that I didn't enjoy. 

Our meal came and it was plenty large enough to share. The meat was tough and had lots of fat bits I had to eat around. The rice and beans were decent, though.

The server was very attentive and refills were plentiful. I don't think I would be interested in coming back, but they seem to have faithful clientele.
