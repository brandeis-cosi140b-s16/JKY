This used to be one of my favorite restaurants.  Even before I moved here, when I would visit, it was always a "must go to". Then the last two times we have been there the food has been terrible.  I mean completely awful. Soggy fish, undercooked, cold food.  The only reason that I would give it two stars is because both times our servers were outstanding.  I don't know if they have a different chef, or what the case may be, but I certainly would not waste any time, or money, going there. Truly a disappointment.
