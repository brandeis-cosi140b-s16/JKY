The food was outstanding. Unfortunately, the service sucked.

 Group of 7 on a Monday night at 6:30 and it took 10 minutes to find us a table. Then 15 minutes to get us menus, water, and chips. Wanted to take our order about a minute after delivering our menus. Then, almost 40 minutes to get the food out. The bartender wasn't our waiter, but he was stuck delivering water, chips, and our food. Needless to say, we didn't get refills on much of anything during the 40 minute wait for our food. Would have complained to the manager, but couldn't figure out who to ask, or if it would have done any good. 

Let me repeat, the food was spectacularly good. And, had I been with a group of drinking friends, the wait would have been tolerable. But, I was with my children on a school night.  

The icing on the cake of craptastic service was the 15 minutes we had to wait to get our bill. I'm not sure they would have actually noticed if we had left without paying, they were that disorganized. As good as the food was, I'm hard pressed to find a reason to return anytime soon. With the competition for my dining dollar at an all time high, Frank and Lupe's doesn't seem to be in the race.
