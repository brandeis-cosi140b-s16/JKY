Went there after realizing that Brugo's was not open as advertised. I liked, just liked the food,but the service is terrible! We were a party do 4 that went in for dinner at about 415. There were only about 5 people in the place so when we entered we were quickly greeted and sat down and were the only party at the dining area. 
Water was poured quickly and we were told our server would be with us soon. So after at least 10 minutes and not seeing anyone but the hostesses, bus staff and bartender,who all were engrossed in television at the bar, I went to FIND A SERVER. She arrived and seemed a bit perturbed and argumentative but took our orders. The food arrived quickly and was just ok, but very overpriced for the servings.
Probably won't be going back here, there are too many great restaurants in the area with great service.
