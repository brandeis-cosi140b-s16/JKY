I'll start with the only positives I have... Great chips and salsa, glad they finally expanded the beer selection to add some decent craft brews, and the patio is nice as long as it isn't wall to wall and that crappy DJ doesn't have his less than desirable music to loud.

The rest, I could take or leave. The food is very average, bordering on poor, compared to other Mexican places. Based on that point, very over priced for the quality. When they first got the craft brews, the good Happy Hour prices applied, now they don't. What gives? Every other place in town will honor Happy Hour prices for all drinks, including crafts.  Weekend evenings are way to crowded, for my taste. 

Overall, a mediocre place to hang out, unless you get their early and choose to drink something that the Happy Hour will actually apply.
