Went to Rokerij last week to celebrate my and my boyfriends sisters birthdays while family was in town.  As always it was my job to scout out a place (I usually do so well thanks to y'all on yelp!).  I was really excited when we pulled up because it was a free standing building that appeared to have a bit of history!

We walked in to a VERY dark bar.  I think that during another occasion this would be fine but a family dinner...ehh.  (Keep this in mind...)

Thank god we had a reservation because there was only 1 server on the floor and we sure knew it.  She reminded us every moment as we stared at our empty water and drink glasses.  Awful service!


As for the food, they serve small plates, salads, entrees, etc...  A wonderful menu with specials posted on the wall that I wish I knew about.  Our server spit them off so fast that we believed she was on some kind of drug!  I went with the ahi salad which was a slip I think.  The tuna was good but lacking some flavor.  The fish was served on a bed of greens but no other veggies at all.  I love a good salad and any good salad has more than 2 ingredients...  Everyone else actually seemed pretty pleased with their food but this could have been because we did not get served until 1.5 hours after our reservation.

Bad service
okay food
bad service

Won't be back...
