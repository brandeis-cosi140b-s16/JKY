I hate to do this, but I can honestly say I'll never go back. I've had a lot of fish tacos in my time, and they've run the gamut, from stellar to absolutely forgettable. And even the forgettable ones are okay as repeats if I'm really in the mood for fish tacos. But the Cabo tacos are just in a whole nother level of bad. The mahi mahi was so overcooked and dried out I could barely press my fork though it. Eating it felt like chewing through paper. The coleslaw was totally boring. And the cilantro cream was "meh." 

I also ordered the nopalito salad which was unexceptional (more like a chickpea salad). The chips were stale. The salsa was extremely bland. 

Yes, I'm from California where you can find the absolute best tacos, so I have to admit that small bias. HOWEVER the carelessness and uninventiveness with which Cabo is approaching their staple meal is unacceptable.

I just read in another review that the Food Network came here. What?!
