For Mexican food, this is just okay.  For Scottsdale mexican food, I guess it could be considered good.

The chips and salsa are very good.  Everything after that was just okay. I ordered the Chili Rellenos and for the most part they were bland and a bit mushy.  The green chili sauce that it was smothered in lacked real flavor. The pork it is was very, very salty.

I hope our waitress was fairly new because she did not know what items were considered vegetarian and then brought out the wrong dish to one of our table mates.
