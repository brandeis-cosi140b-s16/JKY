Not good for vegetarians. They put meat in EVERYTHING. There is nothing like getting a "vegetarian" meal to find meat chucks floating in the sauce. In addition, every time I eat there I get sick. Seriously, the chain Mexican food restaurants need to be banned from Arizona. There are so many great authentic Sonoran Mexican food places around town, the chains just ruin it. Unfortunately none of them are by my house, so I am forced to try these crappy chains... When will I ever learn?
