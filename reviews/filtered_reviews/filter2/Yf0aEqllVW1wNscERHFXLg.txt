I went back for a second time- 

My husband liked the building- I noted again, all the different great details:
Mismatched china, fantastic ambiance, amazing chips and salsa.

Food is pretty good.
But the service just sucks.

A dry, uninterested waitress sort of helped us. 
The margarita I remember being delicious is now made from a mix.

The music mixer was ridiculously loud, so it was hard to talk.
Kind of a bummer how badly those things ruin everything else
