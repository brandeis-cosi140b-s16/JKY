I'm a total downtown hipster-hater, so of course I eyed this place with huge trepidation for a month or so after it opened. It LOOKED like an overpriced, annoyingly pretentious place...but I'm trying not to be so judgy, so I finally went in to see what was up.

Honestly, I feel like there's no excuse to charge these prices for Mexican food. I mean, wtf. It's guacamole and corn chips and tequila, for pete's sake! It wasn't reCOCKulously expensive -- not as bad as I'd feared -- but was still pricey for what it was.

Food-wise, everything was ok. The free chips & salsa are fine, nothing out of the ordinary, but they did replenish our basket without even asking, so I give them points for that. I ordered the cheapest margarita on the list, which at $9 was OK... not bad by Strip standards, but this isn't the Strip!! Then I had the street corn appetizer, which was good, but...any better than real street corn at Valley View & Sahara for a fraction of the price? Then the snapper tacos, which were ok, but again...two smallish tacos for $12 or whatever it was? Really? 

Ambiance-wise, the place was not NEARLY as annoying as I'd expected. It was actually kinda low-key, and I give them points for having plentiful outdoor seating.

Overall, the place was OK, but... too expensive for me to consider going back there.
