Service was great when we arrive. Very tasty frozen margarita and the chips and salsa was excellent.  But all downhill after that. Food was sub-par. Tacos were not very good. My son had chimichanga which was stuffed with cheap cheddar cheese. Beans were horrible.  Taco salad was not good either.   Cheap ingredients.  Would not go back
