The best part of this place is the peppers and onions they give you with the chips and salsa.  I understand that this is the same general staff from Viva Mercados (rip) , that is why Ihave given this place many tries now.  The food is very very bland.  Meat has no seasonings or so it seems.  They put on a go show for the  fajitas, but the fajitas are barely average.    Mole sauce is better then some in town, but it still tastes out of a jar.  Tamales are sub-par, tacos...well who can f-up taco, their tacos were good.  Chili verde was aweful but not great.   I could go on and on. 

 Like I said I really wanted this place to follow the legacy of Bobby's Viva Mercados, but it really falls short.
