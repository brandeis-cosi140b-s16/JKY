To me this was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! I know the difference between GRINGO MEXICAN, and New Mexico FOOD! To me, this could have been lights outs, but the Manager on Duty was our server. Well, time was very slow, refills very slow, and I had five others with them and they must use the same spice(s) in many dishes. Being in the RESTAURANT BUSINESS for over 35 years, I DO NOT LIKE TO GIVE A NEGATIVE REVIEW!! I want to give this place another try, but sampling others, this brings me back to the taste of the food! The PEPPER POT in Hatch New Mexico is the BEST NEW MEXICAN FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD, and this might be a BARRIER on my JUDGEMENT. Just telling it like it is, and sorry if this is a downer!!!
