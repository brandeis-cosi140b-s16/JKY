This is more about the price of liquor than the food, which is just average on a good day. My wife and I had dinner there this last weekend and ordered two margarita's. I asked about the sizes and made a cup with my hands and was told by the waiter that was a small. My wife asked for the large as did I. There were no prices on the menu for liquor and the waiter didn't offer up any and we didn't think to ask. When we got the bill, the prices were as follows....1 strawberry $26.95 and 1 regular margarita $24.95. My complaint is this, if you're not going to post prices then at least have the waiter or waitress inform you of the prices. What's to stop them at $26.95? Why not $30, $40 or even $50 a pop? After that "hand-in-my-wallet" experience, we won't be going back to Garduno's. Ridiculous prices for alcohol and average Mexican food. NOT RECOMMENDED.
