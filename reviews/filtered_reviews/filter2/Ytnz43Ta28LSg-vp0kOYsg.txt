The food tasted decent. I had the brussel sprout nachos. Hubby had plantain tacos the spin oh and mushrooms served with it had not taste. I am surprised the waitress let us order so much food. In my opinion they should inform you about sizes, then again large portions are good right? I the prices were fair. The sauces were brought to us and were warm and almost all empty. Luckily the bus boy got is cold ones since our waitress didn't seem to care. The sauces for the tacos were a nice variety but I don't like the idea of cream sauces that are warm. Especially when we were there for an early dinner 5pm. Can't imagine they kept all Evening. The coconut rice was way too sweet! We will probably try other Mexican places before returning to this one.
