The food here was cheap and awful. The restaurant itself is poorly kept and uncomfortable. I will never eat here again. I would suggest only getting tortillas here if anything. Avoid the burritos and enchiladas honestly just a salty goopy consistency mediocre at best. I would not recommend this food to anyone.
