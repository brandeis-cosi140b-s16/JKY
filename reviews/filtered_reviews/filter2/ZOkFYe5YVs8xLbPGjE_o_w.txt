Went here for lunch with high hopes. Happy to report the management, service and kitchen staff were models of efficiency and quite personable...however, the food was just plain disappointing. I don't mind paying more for high quality food with bold flavor, but what we were served was an epic fail.

Ordered guacamole as an appetizer...it was bland and chopped way too chunky. Chips were fine. We shared Carne tacos and a Polo torte...both were utterly unremarkable. I don't understand what all the hype is about (or what justifies four bucks for a soda with your lunch). Zero desire to return.
