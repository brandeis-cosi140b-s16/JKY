This restaurant probably served me the worst steak picado I have ever eaten in my life, and I have tried this plate at a lot of establishments. The steak chucks were hard, and were super tough to chew. The meat seemed old, and if not old then just cheap and tough. The sauce that the meat was cooked in was rather bland and flavorless. I had to ask for their extra spicy sauce in order to add some "pizzaz" to the food. The soup appetizer that came with the meal was pretty good though, so I give them some credit for that. If it wasn't for the soup this place would get 1 star vs. the 2 stars that I am giving them for this experience. 

The menu seems to be more tailored to the tourists and is not the traditional Michoacan dishes that I have eaten at other places. For someone who isn't up on what "real" Mexican food should taste like, they may like it here, but for me I give this place two thumbs down and a big ol' YUCK!. Never again. This place is totally over rated!
