We came out for Taco Tuesday.  There was a group of 12 of us and the restaurant still had some open seats.  It took 45 minutes to get our first order of Taco's.  While the food was good and the server felt bad they should have had a better grasp on getting the food out the door faster to the tables (everything on the tacos is the same and can be pre done except the meat).
