I wanted to love this place, I really did. It's cute and the food smelled really good. Unfortunately my take - out order really didn't hit the mark. My coworkers and I ordered a bunch of stuff to go. I had the shredded beef burrito and a cheese crisp. The burrito was in an extremely soggy tortilla. Like soggy to the point of being inedible mush. The beef is riddled with onions and tomatoes. The cheese crisp was buried under a huge pile of onions and tomatoes. The biggest upset was our takeout order did not come with chips. We were told we had to purchase those separately. Yet if you sit down in the restaurant and order the exact same food at the exact same price chips are included. Why is that? I really don't get it. Overall, really disappointing. I can't imagine the need to return here.
