Get ready for a cheesy south-of-the-border inauthentic experience, with sexist, insulting quotes hanging above the bar (like - the more you drink, the better she'll look). Because this is what you get in Vegas. A nice spot on the strip for people watching, but don't expect much from the food. The food was mostly bland, except for the "spicy" dishes which were just doused in hot sauce. I'm sure there is good Mexican or Texmex in Vegas, but you'll probably have to get further from the strip.
