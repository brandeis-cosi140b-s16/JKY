For a first time customer I was a little surprised and disappointed with my group of 6. We came at the beginning of happy hour (3PM) and sat on the patio. We ordered multiple appetizers, dessert, and multiple rounds of drinks. Our first round took 10 minutes and once the server saw us looking around she told us the bartender was short handed so drinks would be out soon. During our visit we had 4 different servers, one of them told us their name, and the others proceeded to help when they could. Once we received our tabs they were out of order and not correct. 

-I asked the server why we were continuing to get different people, she said we came at an awkward time so everyone will be taking care of us. I am not sure if that was an appropriate answer. 
-There was no visible manager on staff checking on tables.
-The server laid our checks down before we were even done, one of the girls said are you trying to make us leave? The server replied with no I'm just giving you your checks, sorry. (When do you drop checks if we still have half of a beer?) 

I do not plan on coming back any time soon due to the poor customer service and unfriendly staff. But thank you for good quality food and a great menu. Also, maybe consider getting beer that is allergy friendly.
