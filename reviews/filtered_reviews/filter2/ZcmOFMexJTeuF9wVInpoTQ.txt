Nothing special about this food at all. A person I work with highly recommended this place for their bean and cheese burritos. Also, there have been some ranting raving reviews on Yelp about how awesome it is. What-everrr! 

I ordered the bean and cheese burrito and 2 tacos. When I got my food, the order was totally wrong, with like sausage, and all this other strange stuff. So when I got the correct food I ordered, it was no big thing. The bean burrito was just a bean burrito, and the tortilla was sort of hard to bite into, stale I guess. The tacos were okay, they were the el carbon style like you get at any California taco truck. 

I traveled super far to eat here too because it was supposedly so great. Maybe people just aren't used to great Mexican food in AZ. It was just a dumpy little place, kind of looked like an old Taco Johns or taco bell from the early 80's. 

Next door, there was a fortune teller/palm reader. I should have stopped by there first to learn how lacking this food was going to be, and then not go.
