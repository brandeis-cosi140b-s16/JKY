I saw this place on Dinners, Drive in's and Dives and thought it was local and I'd like to try it. Staff was good, place was cool. But for what I got, 3 small carne asada taco's and french fries... and it was like $18 or about. My wife's pork was good and it was plentiful, but over all, its pretty expensive for small portions of Mexican food. I did not get the Guacamole which I found out later is just awesome. But from my experience... I'll go elsewhere for Mexican food.
