This was very disappointing!  We came for breakfast right after they opened up for the morning on a Sunday, and the entire place smelled like cheap cleaning supplies which really did not help my appetite.  The smell was almost overwhelming the whole time we were there.  

The service was very good and fast, definitely above average service.  However, the food was mediocre to just bad and it was way overpriced for the quality.  I had a spinach enchilada with beans and rice.  The spinach enchilada tasted good, as things that are 1/2 sour cream can't help but do.  It was low quality, high calorie and not very subtle.  

The rice was probably my biggest complaint.  While it had a pleasant orange color, it tasted like...  plain white rice that was a little too old.  Sort of crunchy where it shouldn't be.  The tortillas, salsa and chips tasted like they came  from a grocery store.  

So all this would have been just fine if it hadn't cost like $11 each for our breakfasts.  This being Arizona, I have higher standards for Mexican food and this was way too expensive.
