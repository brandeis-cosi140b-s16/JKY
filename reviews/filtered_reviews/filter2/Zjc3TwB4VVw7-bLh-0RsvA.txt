I love my Mexican food but I don't love overpriced Mexican food. 

Recently on a Vegas trip with some girl friends, we stayed at the Luxor. As we were still recovering from the night before, we decided to make dinner easy and just head downstairs to T&T. I understand that we were on The Strip in Vegas but $13 (before tax and tip) for a chicken quesadilla is pretty ridiculous. There was nothing special about it and I only ate about half before I couldn't choke down any more cheese.

The chips and salsa were slightly better but I would have preferred a traditional red salsa instead of the green salsa and the chipotle (I think?) salsa. 

I'll save a few bucks and pass on T&T in the future.
