Having been favorably impressed by other of the Upward restaurants, I looked forward to my first visit to this new addition in north central Phoenix. I was not much impresssed.  The service was more aggressive than attentive without really being service-oriented.  Servers and bussers were quick to remove drink glasses, for instance, but not to inquire if we wanted another drink.  When the food arrived, our order was incorrect.  The salad we had ordered was replaced by a side of rice, and it took an inordinate amount of time to correct this. Companion and I were halfway through our entrees when the correct salad finally arrived.  I really like Mexican food,  but I was not impressed with the selections we ordered. The oranges in the orange and cucumber salad tasted canned.  The tacos were small and bland.  The chicken burrito was barely warm, tasted like boiled chicken in mayonnaise sauce.  I got the impression of Mexican food for people who do not like Mexican food.  We will give it another chance, maybe just for drinks after work, but not for the food.
