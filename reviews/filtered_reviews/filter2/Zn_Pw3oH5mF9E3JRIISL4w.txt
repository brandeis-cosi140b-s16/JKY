We heard that this food was good from our family members, so we decided to try it out. When we walked in no one greeted us or was at the hostess table. We waited for around 10 minutes before someone seated us, and we were the only people in line to be seated. Our waitress did not know the menu and had to look off of our menus to explain the details. We ordered 3 waters and they took awhile to get here, while our mouths were on fire from the spicy salsa. I ordered the Tex-Mex salad and asked for the dressing on the side when she brought them out the dressing was in the salad, but she said she would have them make another one if I wanted her to. The salad was okay, nothing special. Overall, the experience was mediocre.
