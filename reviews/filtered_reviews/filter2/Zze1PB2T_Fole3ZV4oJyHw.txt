Unfortunately, this place doesn't do it for me.....and that seems to be the case for many other reviewers here.

Four of us came here and ordered different things. Overall and thoroughly, the food quality and taste is just not particularly great. My mom actually, literally hated it.

Service wasn't bad, decor kinda divey......

Ironically, we were looking for a Mexican place and it seemed this was the first one we found after driving for a while. Phoenix is fairly close to Mexico and yet......(??).
