Oh no!  Me thinks not.  Food is bland and lacks creativity.  Service is also not attentive either.  I received a soda refill with a hole in the glass which I discovered a stream forming on the table.  The waitress didn't understand leaking glass so I had to explain HOLE in glass.  I received another soda but the stream was still alive and well.  She did not come back to soak up the spill.   Our plates were surfing Baja style.  Ten minutes later,  gut bomb has been set off.  They may have an extensive menu, but I would pass even on the table of contents.
