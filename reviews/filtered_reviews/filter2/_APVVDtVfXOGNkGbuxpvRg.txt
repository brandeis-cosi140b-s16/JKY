After an hour of frustrated searching for the kind of Mexican joint I'm used to going to in Atlanta, I asked the clerk at Frys and he suggested this place as a second option (his first choice was closed). 

I want relatively inexpensive, tasty, sit-down and REAL guacamole (not that stuff out of a bag). AGAIN and sadly, this place is not it. :( 

First of all, why is every Mexican restaurant in Vegas DEAD when you walk in? It's depressing! 

Second, the burritos are just meat in a tortilla? No. Luckily for me, the service was excellent and the server tried to accommodate my needs. He added lettuce and cheese to the inside of my burrito free of charge. Why does it not come with that stuff automatically? 

Steak inside the burrito WAS tasty, but everything else was mediocre to bad. Guac was the fake bag kind. Gross. 

Salsa was craptacular, but the chips were good. 

And no black beans, just refried beans? No thanks. 

I guess the search continues. :/
