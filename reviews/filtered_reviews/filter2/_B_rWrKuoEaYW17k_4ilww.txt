I was warned against it, but I had a coupon and it was close by. This is by far the most Un-Mexican food I have ever tasted. Bland is a complement. Taco Bell has more seasonings. A combo plate which came with a tostada with canned refried beans, some lettuce, and a sprinkling of cheese (completely flavorless), a cheese enchilada, again tasting of canned sauce, and a bone dry shredded beef taco. Not even an onion or piece of cilantro to be found. If you want a place to take your great-grandma who thinks a little black pepper is too spicy, this is the place for you.
