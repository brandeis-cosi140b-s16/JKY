went here on taco tuesday right before happy hour was ending 
Tacos are small and mehhhhhh all three of us thought the tacos were gross and TINY! 
Drinks were nasty !!!!! 
the outdoor area is super cool looking but the place is just not that great probably wont be back ..there are much better places to go
