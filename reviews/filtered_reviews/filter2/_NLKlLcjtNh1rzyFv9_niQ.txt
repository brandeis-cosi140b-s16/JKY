"Hey everybody, let's go cram ourselves into a patio until we can't feel our extremities!"

"Ummm, that sounds awful, but maybe I'd save some money because I wouldn't be able to get to the bar."

"Save money! No don't worry, you won't do that either. You're pre-mixed margaritas and jack and cokes are going to be at least 8 bucks, so it's impossible to spend an hour cramped elbow to elbow with a bunch of douche bags without at least blowing a couple of sawbucks for no discernible reason!"

"Why in the hell would I spend 8 dollars on a lame pre-mixed margarita that tastes like Hi-C?"

"Because its pre-mixed and poured by authentic amateur weight lifters whose awesome margarita powers can't be contained in shirts with sleeves even on a 50 degree night!"

"Ummm, are there are at least some people in the kitchen who know how to make some decent Mexican food?"

"Who knows! With all the douche bags that take over the tables to play drinking games with soiled sugar packets, no one other then tourists actually orders food sober here!"

"No offense, I'd rather just get loaded at a Manuel's or something."

"Manuel's! You don't need to drive out to Manuel's when you have top-notch Scottsdale doorman that know all the best restaurants within 40 feet of Loco Patron like My Big Fat Greek to recommend to out-of-towners in case it's too busy in there to hear your children crying!"

"Shouldn't a doorman recommend something more authentic and regional to an out-of-towner obviously trying to do something native on their vacation?"

"What's more native to Scottsdale then shallow restaurants and people willing to pay anything to crowd together and feel important!"
