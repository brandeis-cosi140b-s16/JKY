I really want to like this place because the service is very good...sadly the quantity and quality of the food is not...seems like I'm being up sold too.
The chicken taco was very dry and not big enough for a lunch portion on its own...had to add on the empanada to make it a "meal". Empanada was tasty enough but served on a bed of lettuce seemed uninspired. Was charged for chips and salsa too.
$8 for this lunch was too much
