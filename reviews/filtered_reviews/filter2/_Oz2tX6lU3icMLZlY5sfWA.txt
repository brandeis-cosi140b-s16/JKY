In keeping with "Poor Review after one visit (why would I go again?) and a Good Review after at least two visits" I regret having to write this one after only one Review.
I approached the experience with VERY high hopes. I let the "Server," who was extraordinarily helpful and very upbeat, decide what I should "try" on my first visit. He suggested:

              One Green Chili Pork Shoulder Enchilada

              One  Short Rib Enchilada

My Server covered it and after a bit of time in the Brick Over, added Guacamole and Crema (again his recommendation).

One problem, they both tasted identical. Couldn't tell the difference. I believe this stems form everything hot being kept in a steam table (ugh!) and obviously NOT freshly prepared. The taste was spicy but considering the amount of meat (a fairly good portion) I was surprised that the meat taste didn't come through.

The cost of over $9 for two relatively small Enchiladas I thought was a bit steep, but if the quality was better, maybe okay.

With so many good to great "Mexican" alternatives, wouldn't rank in my Top Ten by any stretch.

VERY disappointed!
