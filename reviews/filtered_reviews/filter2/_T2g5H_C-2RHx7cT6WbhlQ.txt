No, no no.  I went here last night with some of my husband's work buddies.  If you have ever been to PB in San Diego on a Saturday night, it's pretty much like that.

First off, all the waitresses are dressed in bikinis and have body paint all over them and have huge boobs.  Hence the name "Coconuts" I guess.  The hostesses, of which there are about 30, dress in short jean shorts and ripped up T-shirts.  As one friend put it, "What the hell are these people going to do in the winter?"  When the hostesses aren't all jammed by the door preening, they climb up on top of the booths and "dance."  At least I think that's what they were doing.  Seriously...it looked like the bad day shift at a strip club.

There was also a guy wearing a sombrero/lifeguard hat, with a pancho tied around his shoulders, and a painted on mustache.  He was walking around blowing a damn vuvuzela and asking who wants to do a beer bong.  I thought his get up was a bit racist, to be honest.  And, yeah, you read that correctly about the beer bong.  They bring in people out of the mall to do beer bong contests and shot contests.  And they also use water guns to shoot alcohol into your mouth.  Classy.

Drinks were pretty pricey and we ordered chips and guacamole for $7...the guac came in a teeny tiny bowl that barely was enough for 2 people to share.

But listen, if you like to look at boobs, enjoy beer bongs, shots, people shooting alcohol into your mouth with water guns, and basically bad college-like experiences, by all means come to Coconuts.  But I'm warning you, it's like going to Tijuana.
