Not Asian, not Mexican, not a great blend of both either. Lackluster combinations don't make fusion cuisine. Best thing here was probably the guacamole. 

Okay, so it's tapas style. Plates are super small, prices add up quickly. Tacos were about $5 each, so yikes. They also advertise an original hot sauce, but I'm under the impression that it's actually Guilin hot sauce.

You're probably looking to spend $25+ per person here for not-so-inspirational food. I recommend you go somewhere else.
