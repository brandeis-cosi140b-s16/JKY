We used to love Lindo Michoacan! My go-to food is mexican.

It was Thursday night and we arrived around 11. Someone greeted us, and took us over to a table with a spectacular view.

We were starving so I ordered table side guac. It was fun to watch them prepare it. I am about to start to dig in the guac when I notice a HAIR in it. So grossed out I tell our bald waiter there's a hair in this guac. He grabs it to examine, and simply shrugs and says, "oh that is just from the avocado peel." 

REALLY? Since when do avocados have hair?

He hastily goes to make another. He really just seemed annoyed at the fact that I even asked. The rest of the dinner I sit there inspecting every bite. 

I understand that sometimes small mistakes like this happen, but I felt the waiter (or manager, I couldn't tell who he was) could have handled this better. He seemed really annoyed that we asked them to re-make it.

Worst part of it all is that we had an $90 dollar meal, and they didn't even comp the guacamole.I'm not expecting a free meal but at least don't charge me for that hairy guacamole. 

This dinner just left a bad taste in my mouth. I most likely will NOT return to that establishment.
