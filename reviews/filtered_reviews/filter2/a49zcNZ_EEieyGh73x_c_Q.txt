Honestly, not that exciting. I heard a lot of hype about it from ASU friends of mine but I wasn't impressed. It was just your run of the mill Mexican food. And I didn't like that you ordered at the counter and got your chips in a paper gravy boat. The whole concept of the resturant would flow so much easier if it was set up like a regular sit down Mexican resturant.
But appreantly it makes wonderful hangover food. I dunno.
