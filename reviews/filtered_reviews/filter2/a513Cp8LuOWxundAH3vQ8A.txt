First of all my take on the food is it is Awesome!  We have always liked the food.  BUT the service really really really is very very very BAD.  They left us at the table with glasses empty fo longer then they should have especially after having spicy mexican food.  Also when it was time to get the check or pay they just completely disappeared.  Service has steadly went down hill.
