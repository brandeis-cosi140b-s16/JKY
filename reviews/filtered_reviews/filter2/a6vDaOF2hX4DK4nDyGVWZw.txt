This place is another Chipotle styled fast food Mexican restaurant brought to you by the owners of Delux and Zen32. Decor and styling are very similar to the other restaurants (eclectic) and is very vibrant. There is a very cool vibe when you walk in and some very original decorations. 

Food. I was very disappointed, since I like Delux quite a bit, I had very high expectations for Revo. The portions were a bit on the small side and the flavors were very lacking. I expected a full flavored carne asada and got a very bland meat burrito with a guacamole that might as well have been just avocado puree. The rice was pretty decent and had a creamy texture similar to a risotto, but needed salt and spices. The only redeeming factors were the amazing lemonade and the salsa. I'm not sure a place this bland will survive with so many other better options around that area, but I know I won't be going back without some major changes.
