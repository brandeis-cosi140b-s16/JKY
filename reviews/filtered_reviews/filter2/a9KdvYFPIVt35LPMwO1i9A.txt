I'll PASS this place, next time I'm driving by. Between the inattentive, uncaring servers and the definite need for the place to be powerwashed inside, I got the feeling that they assume that they will do fine without you or me. Really just a local dive bar that has too many TV's and serves food to some:  this joint needs to rethink their idea of restauranteurism.

I have eaten here twice (never let a bad experience go unpunished), so when I returned last week, I tried the chile relleno. Having eaten rellenos hundreds of places, the promise of a unique experience intrigued me. It was unique, all right!..... Two chiles laying on top of some cheap american cheese with a Baked Alaska top (eggs whites puffed up  and browned to look like a football) over the whole thing. This was not a relleno, It was a FUMBLE! Maybe the WORST relleno of my life. 

Perhaps this is your kind of bar, which is why it got a second star from me, but it doesn't cut it as a restaurant, in my opinion. The photos they provide show a kitchen that seems a lot cleaner than where you eat............ maybe they should keep the food there.
