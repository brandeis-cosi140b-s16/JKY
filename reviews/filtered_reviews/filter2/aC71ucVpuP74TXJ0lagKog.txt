The food i ordered was delish.  Bacon wrapped shrimp. Everyone else also enjoyed the items also. Except for the soggy cheese crisps.
The biggest problem I had was thier salsas are not up to par. I LOVE salsa and theirs was less than mediocre. The people who recommended this place to me told me the same about the salsas. So if any changes could be made that would be one I'd definitely change.
I also had to go find our server twice.
