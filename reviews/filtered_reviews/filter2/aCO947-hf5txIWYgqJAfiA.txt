"I can't move the sun." 

Second time here. First time we just had very rude service. This time it was one of the worst I've ever experienced.

We were seated in the bar area. Restaurant not too busy. Plenty of other seats. The sun was blinding my friend's wife and it finally was too much. We very politely asked to be moved and it was an ordeal. 5 or 6 people involved and ultimately the short haired blonde woman said rudely, 

"We can't move the sun. It will be gone in 5 minutes."   Wow. I know, right? I can't believe we stayed after that. There were so many empty seats not in the sun. Just her attitude was really unusually bad and I'm as laid back a guy as they come.

Then one of the 4 entrees was wrong. Not a huge deal. They were nice and quickly brought out the correct dish.

At the beginning of our meal I ordered a jalape√±o cucumber margarita. Supposed to be delicious. Once our meal was over I figured they just forgot about it. No big deal. As we were about to get the check, the same short haired blonde women brought the drink. This is 15 minutes later mind you. She knew I was going to ask her to take it back.

"Really???" she said as rude as they come with a loud gasp and a sigh. 

She did take the drink back.

Then I asked the same short haired blonde woman for our check. She said ... "GOOD." - Wow, I know. She said good when I asked nicely for our check. I said, "Excuse me?" and she then said quietly, "Sure."

I can't believe it. Still left 20% tip as the main waitress was nice and it wasn't her fault that her surrounding staff were all the rudest people you'll meet. 

The food is great , but I will never go back there again. You couldn't pay me to go back again. I love mexican food , like to tip nicely, and live up the street. What a shame they couldn't put people in the restaurant who even had a mild interest in being there.
