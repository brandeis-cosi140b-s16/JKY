The best part about this place is the patio during the nice months here in AZ its a great place to grab a drink for happy hour. The lunch specials are reasonable they have items from $6.99, 7.99, 8.99 and up. With the free chips and salsa i find that a $6.99 item and a water is just enough. Their menu had advertised $2.00 bottle beer which was a nice treat for lunch. I've tried their nachos and Bravo burro which both were decent, nothing special some of the $6.99 items don't come w rice and beans so pay attn. The service is good if your in a hurry for lunch it wont be a issue to get in and out plus the place is located a block off Mill ave and close to a light rail stop.
