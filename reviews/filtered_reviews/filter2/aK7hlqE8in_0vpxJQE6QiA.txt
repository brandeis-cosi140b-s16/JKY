I was excited to try this place after reading a review elsewhere of the "El Flaco" vegetarian burrito. I found it to be very bland and flavorless. I'm pretty sure it was just saut√©ed vegetables in a bland flour tortilla. The burrito was also surprisingly small, I've had burritos that were easily 3x this size. I asked for hot sauce and several minutes later the waiter/bartender came back with what appeared to be a house made hot sauce. The sauce did help add some kick and flavor to the burrito, but the sauce itself was equally disappointing. A good bit of heat but very little flavor.

And then there's the service. I came on what I would assume was a slow Sunday night. I sat by myself at the bar, there was also a couple seated there. I was not offered chips and salsa, but I figured I'd pass since I wasn't super hungry and was anticipating the burrito. This is probably the only time that I've left a Mexican restaurant feeling hungry!

I ordered the dark Mexican draft beer, which was served way too warm. So there you have it, even the beer was disappointing!
