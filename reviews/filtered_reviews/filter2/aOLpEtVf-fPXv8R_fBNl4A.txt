Lately my dad has been on a Tia Rosa's kick.  And when my dad gets on a restaurant kick, he likes to eat at that restaurant over, and over, and over.  And sometimes I get invited and come along.

After eating here a few times, I decided that it is simply just not deserving of the hype and traffic it gets.  The food is bland.  The salsa they give you is bland...even the "hot" one.  The quesadillas I got are bland.  The rice and beans?  You guessed it, bland.

They're definitely catering to the North Mesa crowd, whose Mormon pioneer ancestors apparently couldn't fit any spice in their wagons when they crossed the plains.

And would it kill you guys to put some cinnamon in the horchata?  Seriously...

Just go to their tacqueria across the parking lot and order the crab tacos with a Mexican Coke or Senorial Sangria... Much better option.
