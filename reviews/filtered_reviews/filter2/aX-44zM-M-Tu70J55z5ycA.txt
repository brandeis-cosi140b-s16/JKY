That's the size portion I'm used to from Chino Bandido.  What we got last week was about 3/4 of that.  


My husband and I have been ordering the combo of jerk chicken, jade red chicken, chicken fried rice and black beans ever since this location opened in Chandler. And have always been satisfied.   

I was so shocked at the portion that I asked the employees what happened.  Their explanation is that they "have not downsized the portions, because the portions were being over-sized incorrectly before.   So, now the portions are the right size."  And looking through the other yelper photos, i see one from '08 that looks similar to (but still more than) the portions size we got last weekend.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/l-D0uS-tgmhkFpHKBXvPQA?select=kGQgU8IelC8DABJQSdIYoQ  So, oK, well, I can understand what the employee was talking about, but, it still is rather disappointing.   Considering that we've ordered the combo more times than I can count, and have never had the "mini/correct" portion-size ever before until last weekend. 

They also used to give my daughter a small cup of rice with a little bit of plain chicken.  this time, when I asked for a little kiddie cup, they gave me the same size cup, but it was empty...

The one thing they give generously still are those big huge sugar cookies.  Unfortunately, we can only ever finish half of those.  I'd rather get a free cup of rice for my daughter, than three big sugar cookies.  If ever we go back, i'll ask if they'll do that for me.  But, we're not likely to come back again even though we like the food, it's just not affordable for our family anymore.  One combo wouldn't even satisfy me as it is now.  For my husband and I, I'd say if we ordered three combo meals, that would be filling.
