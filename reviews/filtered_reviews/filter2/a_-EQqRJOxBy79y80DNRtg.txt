We had dinner here this past week and I have to say that service is amazing but the food is just bleh. We had a guacamole appetizer: I've bought better tasting guacamole from the grocery store. I ordered a roasted half chicken with tortillas rice and beans. For $15 i could have ordered 3 times as much at El Pollo Loco and received way better food. The chicken was dry and tasteless, smothered with some kind of bland red sauce. The homemade tortillas that came with it were pretty good. My hubby got a tamale and it tasted way better than my chicken. My kids ordered the kids meal of chicken fingers and fries, and they liked theirs. It was just disappointing to pay for a $100 meal (including tip), for something I could have got for 1/3 of the price.
