Bland.  That's how I will remember Sol in Scottsdale.  After an hour wait, we expected this place to be great.  I would have even settled for good. But poor is how I rate this place. We had the Carne Asada tacos and the Carnitas tacos. The carne asada tacos had a little more flavor than the carnitas, but both lacked flavor.  The black beans were terrible. I gave the restaurant two stars because the salsa was good and the meat was very tender.  We used the salsa to give flavor to the tacos and beans.
