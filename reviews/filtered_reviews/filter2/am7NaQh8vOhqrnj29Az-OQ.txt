Oh Dear Aunt Chilada, where did you go?

When I was young we would go out to eat on very special occasions.  I remember the excitement of going to Aunt Chilada's for birthday dinners and having a great time.  

I'm not sure if it's the childhood memories not holding up, or the change in management, but Aunt Chilada's truly disappointed me.

We went with a part of four, and I was the only person who had been there before.  The interior and d√©cor was EXACTLY as I remembered it, meaning that in 15 years, I don't think they've even touched up the paint.  Once seated, we found that the room was very noisy, with only 3 parties in the room.  It was also extremely crowded, with tables much closer than they needed to be.

The service was adequate, other than sitting dry waiting for more drinks.  They did bring chips and salsa quickly, and the staff was polite.

Now, to the part that was so heartbreaking for me.  The food.  Meh about sums up what I thought.  I tried a little off of everyone's plate, and across the board it was so-so.  Nothing inspired me, nothing stood out.  While it's still better than Taco Bell, it really seemed like they were phoning it in.  There was no symphony of flavors, nothing unexpected. 

All in all, this is a good place to take your East Coast relatives who can't handle spice, for a stereotypical Mexican meal.  It's kind of like the Disney version of Mexico.  For natives like myself, especially those who either cook their own food, or love a little spice and excitement, don't waste your time.
