Though the service is very good, and owner, Gus, is a great guy, this place is a "Rich Man's" Taco Bell.

Food is very, very Gringo. That would explain why there is always a wait, and why you won't find one real Mexican eating there. 

Portions are large, but so is the price. It is way over priced for Mexican Food. 

Quality is just ok. 

I have a friend who is obsessed with the place, so I will go back if "he's buying".

I did take my neice and nephew, from Korea, who never ate Mexican Food. Gus was nice enough to spice up their food, and they did like the Carne Asada Soft Tacos.

So, if 'it's someone who's never eaten Mexican Food, sure. 

If you want quality and value for your dollar, go to an authenic Hole in the Wall.
