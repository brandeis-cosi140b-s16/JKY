Must have hit it on a bad night. Super bummed with the service and the food. The black bean display is quite odd and I ordered a 15 dollar shrimp dish that left me wondering what id just ate. Beautiful decor and authentic vibes, the food just flopped. We had four different servers, one for drinks one took our food order, one brought the food and one server once I stared and tried to make eye contact refilled my water. I love supporting small places, family places and rly dislike leaving less than stellar reviews, especially one w such great ones. I wanted to love my dinner and rave about it, instead I write this as my disappointment was that big.
