If you like over priced, bougie Mexican food, this place is the place for you.  I don't even really know how Mexican food can be bougie but this place figured it out.  Their menus had convoluted descriptions for very basic Mexican dishes.  

Their tamale appetizer was crap.  It was supposed to be a baked tamale but it ended up being mush.  It wasn't even cooked properly.  If that is the way it's served than don't call it a tamale, call it corn tamalito or corn mush.  And btw, if I wanted corn mush, I would go to Chevy's not a "fine dining" Mexican restaurant.

They don't set the table with salt or pepper, which I think is really weird.  When I asked for salt, the waitress said, "What is it for?  Your chips?"  Like I couldn't have it otherwise.  When the salt arrived, they served it in a side dish.  Not a shaker.

YET, they sell cookbooks. "Don't come back to our restaurant, cook your own food with these books."  BAD marketing.

This place isn't worth it when there are so many other restaurants that don't need to try as hard as Border Grill does.  And, they will offer you salt.
