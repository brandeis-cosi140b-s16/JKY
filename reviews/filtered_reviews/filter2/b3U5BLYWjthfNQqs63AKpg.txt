My boyfriend and I went for the all you can eat (aka 10 tacos) night.  He of course ate all 10. 

 I wanted to like Loco Lime, I really did.  I love supporting neighborhood restaurants but I just wasn't all that impressed.  The only thing with any flavour is the salsa verde.  I didn't like the soft taco shells, there was something bizarrely sweet about them that I wasn't a fan of.  We tried the barbacoa, carne molida and shredded chicken, which were fine but just not anything special.  Loco Lime really is only Mexican inspired.  Fine for people who don't like real spicy Mexican food but not for those of us who love wet burritos and flaming hot salsa.
