hated it.... waiter was a douche pretty hot but definitely knew it tried to pull the whole winking thing then dissapear for 20 minutes and expect us to be ok with it puhhhlease bud.  The whole place is overpriced i mean i know its vegas but still 15 dollars for a margarita in a martini glass?! wtf... we get the chips and salsa and they are pretty good chipotle salsa decent chips.  I ordered the cheviche and it shows up made out of oj and has mandarin oranges in it blecccck way to sweet cant even taste the shrimp laaame.  My friend got the veggie enchiladas and the veggies tasted like oil not even butter which would have been better they did use cotija cheese though.  We high tailed it out of there after that thank goodness
