Loved Richardson's and have loved Rokerij in the past. The downstairs cave bar is still a cool hangout!!!  But their food has really dropped off. I've been there twice in last 2 months with large groups and both times the apps have been disappointing as have the entrees. I think management just isn't paying attention. However, Mondays are half price wine night and with enough wine everybody is happy.  We just won't be coming back.
