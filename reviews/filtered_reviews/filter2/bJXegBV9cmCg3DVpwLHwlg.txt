Frank and Eve (the owners), I hope you or someone who cares reads this!
This is a review of the Chandler location.

I've been a long time patron of Chino Bandido, starting with their first location at 19th Ave and Greenway in North Phoenix.
Quality, care and portions have always been the first priority.
My last three experiences with the Chandler location over the past 4 months have gotten progressively worse each time.
The most recent was this past Sunday evening around 6:30 for a carry out order.  The person who handled the order was very nice.  No issue here.  Although concern arose when she mentioned that the current kitchen staff was making the Egg Foo Yung we ordered for the first time.
The Egg Foo Yung ended up being the best part of the meal, as well as the complimentary Snicker Doodle cookie.
The Hengrenade Chicken was dry and leathery with little flavor left on or in it.  The Diablo chicken was also not their best effort, overcooked and dry as well.
The fried rice tasted as though it had been in a steam pan for hours...crunchy, dry and flavorless.  The kind of thing I might expect at the end of the night from a lesser establishment.
I'm not going to dwell on this, but unless some things change at the Chandler location, I really am not motivated to return at this point.
If I'm up North, I'll try the 19th Ave location in hopes that the same issues are not occurring there.
Frank and Eve (the owners) are wonderful people, so I am hopeful they take action and can get Chandler back to the really good Chinese /  Mexican fusion restaurant they once were.
