I visited this place on Easter Sunday night, and this place was packed with bros sporting their best pastels and girls wearing bunny ears. The mission statement of this restaurant is clear, get their customers as drunk as possible and let them do whatever they want. Let off party poppers in the middle of the restaurant, why not? Dance on the table next to customers that are eating, sure! Only visit if you're three sheets to the wind and want to go to a place where no one cares if you embarrass yourself. 

They're only getting two stars because the margarita I had was quite good, and I'm picky when it comes to margaritas.
