The design of the restaurant is very winning. I love the metal Buddha entrance way. It is a seriously cool looking place to eat.

BUT ... and this is a freaking ginormous BUT ... the prices for what you get at China Poblano are downright ridiculous. Although above average on taste and presentation, the foods themselves do not merit the prices they charge.

$12 for 4 "When Pigs Fly" which are basically roast pork buns. The dough is very light and the filling is tasteful. BUT it is SPARSE. There was barely any actual filling in the bun. Ludicrous.

A typical roast pork bun costs $1.50 at a Chinese bakery on Spring Mountain and it is FILLED with roast pork.

Go. Go yourself and see. It is like a FREAK show. The most freakishly priced DIM SUM you have every seen. Then go to a normal Chinese restaurant and get five times the amount of food for the same amount of money.
