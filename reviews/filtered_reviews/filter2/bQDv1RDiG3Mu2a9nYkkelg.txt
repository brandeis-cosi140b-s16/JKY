La Salsa in California is a take out fast food type place that at least has a self serve salsa bar with a few 'fresh' salsa choices. My friends and I ate at La Salsa Cantina on the strip and couldn't believe our quesadillas came with chips and sour cream...but no salsa. We asked for salsa and it appeared we had asked for shredded black truffles so we said we'll take an order of chips and salsa; that seemed to compute better and btw also costs $2.95. Problem solved? No! We finally got salsa and we all ate it at the same time and said the same thing....' It tastes like a jar of salsa from the supermarket'. Come on now! The name of the establishment has the word salsa in it!!!!
