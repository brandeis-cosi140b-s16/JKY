Disappointing experience on New Years Day. After we were seated, it took 11 minutes for the waiter to take our order. As I was ordering my food, I noticed that the heavy-set man also happened to be sagging exposing his briefs. Not very appetizing. The fajitas were simple with a low quality meat. The fiesta platter was literally thrown together and not appetizing. The salsa was the only thing good. This place has promise, but given the number of stars on Yelp, it's time for the owners to fire the manager before it's too late. If only Jon Taffer rescued restaurants....
