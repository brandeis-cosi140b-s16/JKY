I am surprised that this place received so many positive reviews. I am originally from New Mexico, and was so excited to find this place while traveling thru Vegas. 
To begin with, the place is filthy. Grime cakes almost every surface. The food is perhaps the worst approximation of New Mexican cuisine I have ever encountered. I ordered a chicken burrito, smothered with red and green chile, and was sad to find that the tortillas are not hand made. Also, the chicken inside was dry and rubbery. Any NM restaurant worth it's salt would have slow cooked the meat in red or green chile sauce until it was tender and juicy. The chile sauce was ok, but it was reduced to nothing but a dry crust on top of the dry tortilla. 
My daughter's cheese enchilada was much better, but was swimming in a soup-like sauce. 
I do have to say that the sopapillas were excellent, however. Very authentic and delicious. That is why I gave 2 stars instead of one.
