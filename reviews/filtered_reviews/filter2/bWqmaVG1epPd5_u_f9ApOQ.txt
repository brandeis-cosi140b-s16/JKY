The food is good.  where this place falls down is with the the service.  Our waitress acted like she'd was doing us a favor that she would not rather be doing.  I asked if they served plain black or green iced tea, no added flavors.  She replied, "No, I will bring you some water" and turned and walked away.  No I'm sorry or asking if I'd like an alternative.  Unfortunate, this type of crappy service has been the norm on the 3 times I've been there. The food is really deserving of a 4 (minus the fact that you can't get unflavored iced tea - what is the deal with that?).  However, the put upon attitude of the wait staff is a real problem.
