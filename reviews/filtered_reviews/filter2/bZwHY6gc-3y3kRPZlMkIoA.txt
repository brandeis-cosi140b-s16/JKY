I'm giving this place 2 stars because of the value. It was good Mexican but not for the prices they charge. The total for 2 entrees and a few beers was $70. I don't feel like the meal was worth any where near that. We had the pork Chile Verde and the carne de fuego. Pork Verde was very average, carne de fuego was delicious. Again, overall not a bad place, but I would not eat here again.
