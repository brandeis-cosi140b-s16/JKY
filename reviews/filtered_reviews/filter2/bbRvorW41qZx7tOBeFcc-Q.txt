Nothing special. Unimpressed with the salsa (I've had jarred that is better). The four people in our party tried the Sour Cream Chicken Enchiladas, the Chicken and Beef Enchiladas, the Burrito special, and the Tacos El Carbon. Nothing terrible, but nothing to write home about either. Tasted bland and pre-packaged.
