First and last time. Just moved in down the road and was looking for a new regular place.

Ordered two Platter Meals and two beers totalling $35 only to then be told it would $2 more if we wanted chips. I feel like $12 for a platter should include chips. 

They also charge a 75 cent fee if you want to use a card. I was under the impression that was illegal. I could be wrong. It's a rip off either way.

Apparently they run their kitchen better than they run the business. The food was decent overall however it fell short the price tag. Rice was bit bland and the beans were too thin. 

The Shrimp Endiablados was actually pretty good. Salsa bar was average. Nothing to really stand out.

Staff was extremely polite and the storefront was clean but I left feeling like I had been taken advantage of. You got my two bucks for chips Lu Lu's, but you lost my business.
