I read all the great comments thinking this place would be a great find. To my disappointment, I was not pleased. 

The service was very slow, even though it wasn't very busy. There were even other customers complaining asking where their food was. Come to find out, the food was just sitting on top of the counter waiting to be served. Another couple next to us paid for their drinks and left after waiting way too long for their food. 

We finally got our food after about 30 mins. We ordered the bulgogi fries, combination fried rice and the bulgogi burrito. Everything just tasted average. Nothing to rave about. 

I will not be coming back.
