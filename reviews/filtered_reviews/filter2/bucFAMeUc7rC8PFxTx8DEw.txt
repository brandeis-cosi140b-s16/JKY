Ok, so this place is getting such high reviews and I'm sorry to burst your bubbles, but it's not my thing. The staff were extremely friendly, but the food wasn't the greatest. They turned Hawaiian food into a Hispanic fusion which is a neat idea, but I guess what I'm trying to get to the meat was REALLY REALLY salty. The salt took all the flavor away from the meal. I had to toss my burrito out after two bites. I'd recommend you to try it for yourself, but it's not somewhere that I would go back to.
