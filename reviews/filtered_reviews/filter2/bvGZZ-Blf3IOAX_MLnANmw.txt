I admit I didn't have very high expectations walking into this place. My girlfriends were meeting there for Happy Hour and after reviewing other Yelp reviews, I wasn't too excited. I was right...

The food: I got Mahi Mahi platter. The fish was pretty gross and bland. The menu said that it was grilled, but it tasted mushy and boiled. Like someone just defrosted it and threw on the griddle right before the order.  The only item that was nearly edible on the plate were the black beans, but even they tasted right out of a can to the plate style.

Drinks: I actually was not planning on drinking that night, but asked what kind of wine they had. The waitress said house. I asked if they had a wine list, she literally rolled her eyes and said that they only have house white and red. I decided to skip it and stick with water.

Service: I worked as a server for 5 years throughout college years and I usually have a lot of patience for servers as I know their job is very hard. Our waitress literally had a smart remark to everything we said or rolled her eyes. When we finally asked for the bill, she took 20 minutes to bring it to us and spilled a sweet drink all over our credit cards while checking us out. She didn't even bother to wipe the mess when she brought us our bills back. Everything was covered in a sticky mess!!

Unfortunately, will not be going back to this place.
