Disappointed given the otherwise positive reviews. 

Fish tacos aren't that hard but when I ordered three, I was told it would be another ten minutes. No problem but when I see what looks like a bag of frozen tilapia (I think it may have been fresh) being pulled out, cut into three minuscule pieces, and slapped on a grill, I'm not excited. Throw in white rice and very plain black beans and I've really lost interest. 

Then, when I'm ready to pay, the price is increased by $1.50 because I ordered the fish. I'm fine with that, but at least put it in your menu board so it is clear. It definitely isn't worth an up charge. 

Bottom line: the flavors of the food were decent (green spicy salsa was good), but I'd rather have La Salsa or Baja Fresh for a cheap taco on the Strip. Also lacked any atmosphere.
