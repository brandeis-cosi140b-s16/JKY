The food was really good, but the service was horrible for a non-busy time. I got the carne asada tacos with guacamole, which were delicious, but it took my family almost an hour to get our food from the time we sat down at our table! Then it took about 20 minutes after we ate to get our checks! If the service was better, I would've really enjoyed this restaurant.
