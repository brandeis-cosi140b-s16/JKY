I went to this place like a month ago. It was awesome. I couldn't wait to go back. I had the beer battered shrimp which were huge and their beans and rice were so flavorful. I subsequently went back last week and it was not the same at all. The beans were runny (like they were watered down when they were really thick before). The shrimp went from being huge to about the size of a quarter. I was really disappointed. I'm hoping they just had a bad day and this will not be the norm.
