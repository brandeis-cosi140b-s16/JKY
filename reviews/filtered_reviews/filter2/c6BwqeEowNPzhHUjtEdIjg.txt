We visit our son in Phoenix fairly often and when we go up there, we enjoy trying new places to add to our repertoire of ethnic delicacies. Whether, Chinese, Mexican, Greek.  We are open for anything.   I checked out this place on Yelp for reviews and all of them were great.   I was looking forward to finding a "gem" of a Mexican restaurant.  We all agreed that the dishes were mediocre.  It wasn't the cleanest place either.  I ordered my usual chicken enchilladas  with green sauce.  Very tasty and a little different.  They marinate the chicken, pork, and beef which makes the chicken, pork and beef a little bit mushy.  The rice was tasty though.  My other half ordered the chille relleno which was also a little bit different from what we are used to.  It was served in a brown sauce with cheese, onions, and diced potatoes.  Pretty tasty. He also had a lengua (tongue) taco. Small but also very tasty. There is no waiter service.  You go up to the counter and order.  I'm not crazy about the plastic plates, but no tipping is a good plus.  We went for lunch about 2.00PM and the place was crowded.  So obviously lots of people enjoy this place.  The menu was plentiful with lots of choices.   I understand the place was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins-and Dives.  I guess you could label this place in the Dive category.  Prices were quite reasonable.  All and all, if you like Mexican Street food, Los Taquitos might fit the bill. I'm not sure if we will return or not.  We will still try other places to finally find Mexican Food Heaven.  Even if nothing is perfect, the journey to get to it is the best part.
