This place isn't all that, the food was low quality for high prices and the whole place really needs to be deep cleaned. The outside of it is really cool, kind of a beachy atmosphere with beach volley ball and horse shoes. The tables inside were dirty the TV inside looks like there was dried on blood running down. The only reason I went was because of Groupon, that's the last time I do that. I went last winter on a Wednesday for happy hour and got 10 cents wings, I guess if I ever go back it'll only be on a Wednesday.
