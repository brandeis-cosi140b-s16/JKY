Been here a few times now because it's very convenient to our house. I've tried both breakfast and lunch and really wasn't impressed at all with any of it.  The place is always packed for lunch and dinner, but I'm not really sure what the fuss is all about.

The chips and salsa are just ok. Not very fresh tasting.  The sauces on the burritos and enchiladas taste like it's canned (or just old).  I've had much better for a lot less money.  The dishes are spendy and the portion sizes are small.

On the good side, the service each time was great!
