I started to browse a menu from my table after sitting down for breakfast, and was immediately grossed out by what appeared to be avocado smeared on the first page. I grabbed the other one... Grease stains. Maybe chorizo. Let's try the next table over... Definitely salsa on this one.  As I'm sitting there squinting at other tables trying to spot a new-looking menu, a female server whooshes over to my table with a scowl and snatches one of the grimy menus and returns it to the table that I took it from. No welcome, no hello... Just a hit and run menu snatching.  Luckily she was not my server; I don't think that we would have gotten along.  My server turned out to be Maggie, who was prompt and friendly.  Thanks to her my day got started with about 4 glasses of coffee and a smile.  

No help from the food though, or the prices. I got the huevos, scrambled, with chorizo, home fries, and tortillas. The plate lacked any sort of garnish (cheese?  Sour cream? Pico de gallo?) and the side of salsa I asked for was 3 bucks. 3 bucks for a couple spoonfuls of salsa!!?  Good thing I didn't know about that charge til I got my bill, or I might have had a salsa free breakfast. The 'home fries' reminded me of the chewy cubes of frozen potatoes you used to get in middle school cafeteria with your French Toast sticks and oj with a peel back aluminum lid.  

3 bucks for a side of salsa??!?  You kidding me?!  

You'd be better off getting a Naked Juice protein shake from the Hudson's News store and coming here for booze if you feel so inclined.
