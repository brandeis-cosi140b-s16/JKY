Food
$10 lunch special.
The tacos were ok. It didn't have that much meat but it was tasty enough. I would've like a variety of tacos instead of getting three of the same tacos. It came with beans and rice. The salsa and chips had no flavor and the salsa was too watery.

Decor
Reminds me of a Hooters.

Service
Excellent service. Then again there were only a few of us here.

Would I come here again?
Probably not.
