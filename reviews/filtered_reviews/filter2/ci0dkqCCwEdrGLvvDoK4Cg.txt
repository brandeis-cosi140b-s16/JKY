If you want GOOD food by the LinQ, go to Brooklyn Bowl.   If you want GOOD Mexican food with great service and a patio....there's a place at Fashion Show Mall that's awesome.....or you can go here if  you don't care about much.

Food was okay....a lot of filling the portion size with cheap ingredients like onions (the fajitas were 40% onion) or cabbage (the shrimp tacos were 50% cabbage even though the cabbage wasn't mentioned on the menu while the sprinkle of green onions was).

The service.....don't come here if you're hungry.  You'll wait a Loong time.  If your server gets your order wrong because the music is so loud that she can't understand you,  your friends will be done eating by the time your meal arrives.   The only reason this isn't a 1 star was because the manager comped the meal that was wrong.....but it still came with fries instead of rice.
