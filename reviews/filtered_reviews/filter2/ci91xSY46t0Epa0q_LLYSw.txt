Wasn't too impressed.
Pros: 
Free wifi
Close to UNLV
Has TV for entertainment while eating
Shrimp cocktail was good

Cons:
Ice machine was broken, but they still were serving drinks from the machine.
Also, there was no syrup in the soda machine, they should have placed a "not in service" sign and only sold bottled drinks instead of wasting people's money.
Air conditioning didn't seem to be working, it was very hot in there.
There was a junk mess where the seating area was.

Honestly, we probably won't return here, I think I'm being generous with the stars.
