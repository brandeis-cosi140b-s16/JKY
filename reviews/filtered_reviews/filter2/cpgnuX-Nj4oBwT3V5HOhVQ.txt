Being a lover of Mexican food, living only a couple blocks from here, and being someone who generally has everything comped at Red Rock, I really wanted to love this place.

The buildout of the space is gorgeous. The staff friendly and attractive. The food though, is dismal.

I had hoped for a more high-end fine dining Mexican food experience. Unfortunately, this food doesn't even rise to the level of the fast food Mexican joint in the food court of the same hotel.

The trio of guacamoles is interesting and probably the best thing here, but none is exceptional. Our enchiladas were overcooked to the point they were just mush. My wife had the fish tacos which were unexceptional. 

The steak tacos deserve a special mention. If you ever find yourself in need of material to repair your shoe, I would recommend the meat from these tacos since it would take a chainsaw to permeate it. I called the server over and demonstrated how you could stretch the meat to 3x its size and it would snap back into its original shape. The server asked the chef who told her he only uses whatever cut he uses. My guess is that it was the lowest grade approved for human consumption. This is odd since the best beef to be found in the city is less than 1,000 feet southeast of this restaurant. If we had paid, we would have asked not to - something that has happened maybe once in 3 years.

This is too bad. They have everything they need here to make a landmark restaurant... Location, staff, buildout... (That's why it gets two stars instead of one), but the food sucks. It doesn't even rise to "taco truck" level. I feel nothing but sorrow and despair for those that have given this restaurant 4 and 5 star reviews - it is baffling. I've been here twice. I love Mexican food, but I can't do it again, even if it is free.
