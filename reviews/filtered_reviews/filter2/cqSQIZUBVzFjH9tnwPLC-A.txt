Wow, Mexican food as good as I get in Vancouver.....

I have been trying to get my fill on Mexican food while here in AZ and got drawn in to Cafe Rio by their fresh homemade tortilla sign. It is kind of sad when the tortilla is the highlight of the meal. 

I ordered the Maria Enchilada with medium salsa and had pico de gallo on the side. It was so devoid of flavor, spice or heat that I would consider it the equivalent of Mexican baby food. There are so many other better places to go.
