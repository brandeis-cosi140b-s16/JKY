I really try to judge restaurants on their food when I am writing a review, but I've been to Distrito 3 times and twice the service was just not up to par. I'm from Philly and still have family there and Jose Garcis is a big name in the restaurant industry in that city. I've been lucky enough to go to multiple eateries of his and have loved every one of them. It's a shame the people running his restaurants in the valley aren't able to do his name justice. 

Old Town Whiskey has already closed, which was another restaurant of his located in the same hotel. I went once and thought it was very good, but the service there was sub par as well. Distrito's issues are just too much for me to want to go back again, even if I do enjoy their food. The last time I went a friend and I sat outside and ordered drinks and tacos. The drinks came, but after 30 minutes we realized the tacos were not. We asked for the bill and our waiter gladly got it for us, didn't mention the tacos that we ordered and we left. I understand that some jobs can be difficult, but if you can't do your job correctly then you don't deserve to have it. 

The previous time I went was for dinner and we waited for a server, then waited for drinks, waited to order food and waited for refills. There are too many other restaurants in walking distance that I enjoy to waste my time, and money, at Distrito.
