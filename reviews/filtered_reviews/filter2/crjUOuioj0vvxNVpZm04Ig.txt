So. Much. Potential. With a long history in the food service industry, I am always sure to give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt, but Bakersfield has swung very hard, come very close, and missed. 

I've had a taco before, believe it or not, and this particular taco was certainly above average. The problem here lies with the atmosphere and service. My party placed their orders... Actually... Screamed their orders over the music (which was cranked to 11). When the food finally arrived, it was presented on one large tray and left to us to decipher what was what and whose was whose. 

I didn't mind the food, but the margarita was pretty weak, and the overall experience lacked polish and enthusiasm.

I wish I could say I'll be back, as the restaurant's concept and mission are something I look for in a dining experience. However, the overall experience was a huge letdown... My future Mexican outings will be to Paco's Tacos.
