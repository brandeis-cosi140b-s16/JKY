New to the area, we've driven by La Ristra several times and always say that we should stop. Craving a "Mexican style" dinner last night, we decided to give it a shot, to go. $46 for three entrees and a side of guacamole seems a little high for this style of restaurant. We were still hopeful, despite feeling that the price was too hi for take out. When we opened our $15 steak fajita entree, there were three small pieces of steak and a few pieces of green pepper. It only filled the main portion of a to go styrofoam tray halfway.  There was a small bit of rice and a small portion of beans. My husband barely made two small wraps out of what was provided. The guacamole was bland, no flavor. Our other two entrees were just mediocre. We won't be back and do not recommend this place to anyone. I feel it's important to let places like this know that just because you order take out doesn't mean you deserve sub-par food. If we'd have been in the restaurant, I would have sent this food back. Don't waste your money here when there are so many other great places close by.
