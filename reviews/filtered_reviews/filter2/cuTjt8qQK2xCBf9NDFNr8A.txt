I found this place on yelp, I was craving some mariscos close to the hospital where I was visiting. I really wanted to love this place because unlike other Mexican mom and pops restaurants they had excellent service. We were greeted and seated quickly, the waitress quickly took our drink order and brought them right out. After she took the food order we were given complimentary tostadas de ceviche. As for the food the chips and salsa were on point. But the beans and rice were terrible. The camarones culiche were not spicey at all and just lacked flavor. I'll go back for drinks but not food.
