This restaurant is SUPER loud.  While we were there, there was karaoke, music trivia and a congo line.  There are also ballon animal makers and photographers.  It's a great atmosphere for the kids and twenty-somthings...not so much for those of us who are older.

We had margaritas which are supposed to be a specialty.  They were just OK.

We ordered tortilla soups as an appetizer and steak fajitas to share.

The soup was fantastic!  The fajitas were not great.  The steak was very tough and there wasn't much of it.

They many signs are fun to read.
