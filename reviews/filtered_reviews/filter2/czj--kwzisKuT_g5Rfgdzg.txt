I have eaten here before and at the Central Phoenix location and was a little surprised how rude the staff were.

My friends and I went in Friday night for drinks and appetizers and asked to be seated outside. She took us to a far corner table off by ourselves on the front patio that was covered in dirt. We then asked to move inside and she shoved us in the very corner booth by the kitchen where we were almost hidden from the entire restaurant when there were plenty of other booths and tables open. 

Our actual server was very nice but it honestly took incredibly long to simply get a drink refill on our water, chips and salsa. They were not that busy, it just seemed due to the seating location we were so hidden and off by ourselves he kept forgetting about us. 

After we finished the food the plan was to hang out and order a few drinks until we decided where else to go. Another server came over immediatley and dropped the bill. He then came back three or four times to check and see if we had placed the cards in there yet. I dont get why servers do this. IT IS SO RUDE. We werent in a hurry, they werent busy at all, we werent bothering anyone but yet they made us feel like we were a complete burden by being there. Ordering $7.00 drinks x4 and food and minding our own business I wouldnt think to be a hassle of a table. 

Im only giving them two stars for the food because thats been on point every time I have been there. I used to work for this company when it was jointly owned with the folks from Chelseas Kitchen.. I remember first hand how seriously customer satisfaction was taken while employed with them and am sad to say, they are not carrying on that same mindset to this new concept.
