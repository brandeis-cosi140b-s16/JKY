The food wasn't terrible but was bland. The service wasn't bad, just slow. We were seated pretty quickly and even had our order taken quickly. The numerous amount of staff kept our drinks on full. Even often times refilling or brining new drinks when our drinks were still 75% full. In the end we felt that it was a cover up to how slow their food serving was. It took forever for our food to get to the table. We have been told that the timing is solely about taste and delivery but when we received our plates we wondered why they still lacked taste. My two cheese enchilada in red sauce plate was disappointing in all areas. The cheese was cluttered and not melted and the red sauce was overbearing. My husbands fajita plate was alright to his taste yet he said it was a little bland. All he received was a tablespoon of guacamole and when he asked if he could get a little more we joked about how he better not be charged for the additional tablespoon sized guacamole they brought to the table yet we were charged $2.50 which was ridiculous. Only saving grace to my disappointment was the two child plates. We ordered a child chicken enchilada meal and a child beef taco meal. Granted my kids both skipped on the rice and beans, they both ate their main dish which was a plus for me seeing as how my WHOLE plate went untouched and I was still charged and had to pay for mine. Definitely not worth it and won't be back. Which is really disappointing because upon being seated, another couple was raving about how they've been driving from Boulder City to come to this place for awhile....
