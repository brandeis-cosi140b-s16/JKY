I don't get this place. As it was my first time in there, I like to ask the employees what they recommend. They recommended their green chili burro. OK, I'm game for anything. 
Once it arrived, I was unimpressed. It already had lots of "juice" (water?) leaking out of it. I asked if they had hot sauce, and they said they did, for .75 - Ummmmmm, seriously? A Mexican place that charges for salsa? Well, I had to get it just to give the thing some sort of flavor! It didn't help much. I also asked for salt, which they said they didn't currently have, well that could explain some of the lack of flavor!
At the time I was there they were only accepting cash, which I told them I attempted to come in prior to that visit, but had no cash on me. For what I got, I thought it was overpriced, and bland.
I haven't been back for awhile, but with the hit and miss reviews, it doesn't look like I'll be rushing back anytime soon either.
