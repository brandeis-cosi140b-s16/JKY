Went there sat with high hopes of finally finding a decent place to eat..as we were looking over menu..Juan the owner came over..we told him it's our 1st time here..he said order the fajitas..it's the best you'll ever taste..and he said if we didn't like them..he would buy our meal..so we ordered chicken fajitas for 2..and I ordered 1 crispy beef taco..server was horrible..had no knowledge of the menu or ingredients..the food came out..of course the fajitas smelled awesome..that's from the liquid they pour on to make sizzle..after the sizzle dies down..I could really tell the chicken had no flavor at all..hardly no bell peppers or onions like they should..didn't like my taco..I want shredded cheddar cheese..but it came with the white crumbly cheese that I don't like..I couldn't even send it back..because after the server..which had no personality whatsoever..dropped off our food..he never checked back not once..so I finally got someone to get the manager..he felt really bad..and he bought our lunch..which we hardly touched..which was nice..he then gave me his card with a 10% discount for us to come back and give it another try.. the salsa had no flavor..and it wasn't even a little spicy..tortillas were overcooked..I have no idea how this place got 5 stars..I honestly think people dont know good mexican food...
