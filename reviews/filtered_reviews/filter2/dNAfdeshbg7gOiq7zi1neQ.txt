I was seated at the patio, very tiny place, with cramped seating. Did not enjoy my dinner, because the food looks great but it didn't taste that good. It's definetly not authentic Mexican food, would rate it the best bar food so far. Regardless of the food I found my dinner experience here unenjoyable due to my seating. Most annoying seat ever. People kept constantly walking behind me bumping into my chair. I just wanted to enjoy my view of the Ballagio fountains but this ruined it for me. The food is pricy for what your getting. I get it's on the strip but not worth it. Won't be back unless its just to drink. service was bad the waitress kept ignoring us and being distracted when speaking to her. She also took 30min just to get us cashed out.
