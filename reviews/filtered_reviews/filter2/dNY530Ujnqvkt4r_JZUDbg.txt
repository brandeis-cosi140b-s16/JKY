I want to give this place 5 stars so badly because I know a lot of my friends enjoy these tacos and the atmosphere is really awesome (like a modern-day cave with writings all over the wall), but being the picky vegan that I am, I just can't do it. I've had all 4 types of vegan tacos available here and each one tastes almost exactly like the last. The vegetables are greasy and unpleasant and I struggled to find the tofu in most of the tacos. I also ordered the sweet potato fries and they were puny, shriveled remnants of what probably used to look like fries before they were cooked to death. 
Maybe the tacos with meat are much better, but overall I wouldn't recommend this place to vegetarians.
