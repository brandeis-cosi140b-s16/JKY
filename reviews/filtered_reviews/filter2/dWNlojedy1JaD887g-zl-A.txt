The food is okay.  I ate there last night with my girlfriend and four of her friends.  I had the shrimp burrito.  I wasn't spectacular, but it was okay.  It was not worth the $19 I paid for it, but those are Strip prices.

My main reason for the two star rating is their unwillingness to accommodate their customers.  Apparently, they have a policy of not doing separate checks. There were six of us at our table, most of us using credit cards to pay.  The waitress basically said we had to figure out how much each of us owed and she could run each card one at a time, subtracting what we told her from the bill each time.  After ten minutes of trying to figure out the bill and how we would deal with the tax we finally got the manager and complained about the policy.  He ultimately agreed to do it for us and it took another ten minutes to separate everything in their computer with one of the members of our party helping him sort out the bill.

I have worked in three different restaurants in the past, not to mention have eaten in dozens of restaurants here in Vegas and never have I had a restaurant tell me they won't do separate checks.  Las Vegas is a top tourist destination in the entire world.  People come here in groups.  Why on earth would any restaurant have a policy like that in a city like this?  It defies logic and it's extremely inconvenient.  As someone who has waited tables and bartended in the past I do understand how annoying it can be to be asked to split a check for a large group at the end of the meal, but our waitress was asked up front and I didn't even show up until everyone else had finished eating so my check should have been easy to split off. 

I was not happy about us having to jerk around with this for twenty minutes when we were ready to leave.  Change your policy, folks.
