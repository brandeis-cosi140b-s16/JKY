After walking thru the miracle mile shopping center in Planet Hollywood I was starving. Mexican food sounded good so I shared steak and chicken fajitas with my boyfriend. 

The food was actually pretty decent but getting the food took forever! We waited for forever just to get our drinks and pretty much had to hunt someone down to order our food. Even after getting our food the waiter forgot about us, so then I had to hunt him down again to get more drinks. The service was horrible! Every person from the lady seating us to our waiter must have been having a horrible day because they were anything but friendly!

They had a photographer walking around who would take pictures of each table and give you a post card of the picture for free. She would then offer other pictures that of course cost money and boy oh boy! Beware, if you don't want these photos she gets upset! It's hard to have a nice lunch with such negative people surrounding you!

On the plus side, we sat outside which was great for people watching! Overall I would probably pass on eating at this place again. There are so many other restaurants in Vegas that have better service and even tastier food.
