Mel rose St Fair was jammin' and gave us the opportunity to duck into Los Compadres for eats. Previous reviewers helped me out and I went straight for the cheese crisp with chili strips. Their kitchen was great and delivered the crisp light on cheese, as ordered. My beau tried the remaining of the menu; taco, tamale, and green chili enchilada. His dishes were OK.  Tamales don't compete with local fare.  Beans are definitely good. Restaurant is clean. Just not spicy enough for us.
