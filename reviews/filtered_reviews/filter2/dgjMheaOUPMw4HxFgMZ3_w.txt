I don't understand how this restaurant is so busy and so highly rated on Yelp.

Positives: The restaurant, decor, and atmosphere is gorgeous! The wait staff was friendly, and I feel they did a decent job serving considering how busy the restaurant was. Those are the reasons I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of one.

Room for Improvement: The food was SOOO far from authentic Mexican it was shocking considering we live so close to the border. The food my husband and I received was the type of Mexican you'd expect in a random east coast town that had no clue; what is sometimes referred to as "White Mexican."

The carne asada was bland and greasy and resembled more of a pot roast. The rice was bland and downright soupy it was sitting in so much liquid.  The refried beans had a barbeque, smokey flavor to them that was more reminiscent of baked beans than refried beans which was odd to me. The salsa had an overwhelming barbeque flavor to it as well, and hardly any spice to it. 

You also won't find your traditional "combo plates" on the menu. While they have their own "unique" version of combo plates, you will not find hard shell beef tacos with rice and beans on the menu. 

Bottom Line: Although this restaurant tries to create a unique perspective on Mexican, they miss the mark when it comes to flavor and quality. It's not a good sign when practically the only people eating in your "Mexican" restaurant are of the Caucasian persuasion. I'll stick with Baja Joes and even Serranos a block down.
