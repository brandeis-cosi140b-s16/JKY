The food compared to other Vegas restaurants is mediocre... As a group of 8, our biggest complaint was that they could not split up the bill. It took over 40 minutes to figure out our bill so the semi disrespectful manager then split it up for us and took about 15 minutes. I guess their computers must be obsolete.
