We came here for the USA vs Portugal World Cup match. It was packed for the match.My friend ordered the nachos for everyone to share. It took forever to get them. I'd say close to an hour. I understand it was busy, but things were a bit chaotic it seemed. When it finally came out they were a bit soggy and we had to use forks to eat them. It made me wonder how long they sat waiting to be delivered to our table. We expected better from a $16 nacho.

The service here was slow. Our table didn't have a server so we had to go directly to the bar. On a busy Sunday there was only 1 bartender so it took a while to get a drink.
