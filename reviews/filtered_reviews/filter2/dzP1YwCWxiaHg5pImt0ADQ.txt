Fiesta Burrito is meh. As an Arizona native I'm picky with my Mexican food. I am always skeptical of drive-thru Mexican restaurants but I was so hungry and the reviews looked good.....

I ordered the carnitas burrito and a medium hortchata. For the record, the hortchata is excellent! Sugary and sweet, but lighter than most. The burrito was huge - definitely a meal and a half. I didn't like the burrito at all, unfortunately. Everything was fresh and the tortilla, quac, and pico were on point. The carnitas, however, was dry and fatty. I couldn't even chew through some bites.

I'm not really surprised with my experience at Fiesta Burrito. It's cheap and quick and similar to most fast food Mexican joints. I might come back here in the future. If I do, I will be ordering vegetarian! Cheese enchiladas, bean and rice burrito, quesadillas, and don't forget the hortchata!
