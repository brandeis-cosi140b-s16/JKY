The only thing "authentic" about El Zocalo is the patio and live music by Freddie Duran.  The restaurant had a strikingly great vibe the moment I walked in.  Once we were seated I felt as though I was in Mexico- until the waiter came. Short story: The other IMPORTANT aspects of El Zocalo  need some revising.  To start, the waiter was less than enthused to be there. I think he only said 5 words to us the entire night.  Our drinks,the Cadillac Margarita, tasted like fruit juice, the guacamole appeared to frozen prior, and they CHARGE $1.50 for a side of El Tapatio!!!!  I will admit the shrimp enchiladas were tasty. But not worth going back for. 

I saw this restaurant in a magazine which listed it as being one of the top 85 restaurants in the Phoenix area.  I don't know who critiqued it, but they have obviously never  been to Mexico.  I gave the restaurant 2 stars.  Being a restaurant in downtown historic Chandler, with the name El Zocalo, you would think they have more to offer on a dessert menu than the Americanized Deep fried ice cream. When I hear the word "Zocalo" I think : busy, all encompassing, and D.F.  El Zocalo embodies the heart of Mexico City.  Hence such a big name for a restaurant with such a little taste.  The waiter told me they "used to have Tres Leches" for a week.  Then he said that no one ordered it.  ??
