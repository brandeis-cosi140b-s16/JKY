Meh is correct. One of the worst margaritas I couldn't finish. I think you could get better Mexican food from the freezer section at a grocery store. I'm not sure how this could really have 3.5 stars. Maybe these Yelpers are drunk and need to go home.The nachos were at least edible, so I'll give them that. But those empinadas, nice try, Gonzales. Yuck-O!
