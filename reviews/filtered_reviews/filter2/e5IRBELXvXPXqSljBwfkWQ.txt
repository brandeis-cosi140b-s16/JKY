Ok so I guess I'm the odd one out here. The service was great the happy hour deal with imported beers for $2.50 was excellent but the food was just average. Well the chips were ok with the salsas, beans and sour cream but both of our meais were disappointing. It almost tasted like the food was premade and then heated up though I wouldn't accuse them of this it just sort of tasted that way. I had the veggie combo - the chile releno was mostly breading and kind of bland, the enchilada was decent but nothing that made it stand out and the taco was almost all lettuce with some beans but not much flavor.  They do charge for extra chips but to me for two people that's not a big deal since the portions are more than enough with one basket of chips. I will give it a second shot since everyone here says it's very good.
