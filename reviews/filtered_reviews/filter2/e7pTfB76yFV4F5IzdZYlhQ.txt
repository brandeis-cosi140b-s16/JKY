Aiyaaah. $15 for a burrito...my wallet was sighing.

Came here expecting a pretty easy process to grab a burrito to go. Guess you should go somewhere else for that. My friend and I wanted to escape the overpriced food court next door w/ $8 Subway footlongs and $4 Wendy's chicken. We decided on burritos, and just shelled out the money hoping for a legit burrito. After waiting 15-20 mins, we were less than satisfied for the amount we paid but at least we got beans and rice on the side which was nice. Perhaps I am too used to Chipotle and other legit Mexican places...well now I know.
