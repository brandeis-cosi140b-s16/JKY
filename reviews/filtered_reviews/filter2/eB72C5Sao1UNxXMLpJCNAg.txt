Dirty. Alright Valle Luna I feel like it is finally time to speak out. I am sick of defending this establishment to others. I've come here about 100 times over the past decade  and never once has the food ever been bad. Everything has always been tasty, but the lack of effort to keep your restaurant clean is unacceptable. This had to be why your restaurant was given a B rating. I always come here with my girlfriend and every time we come one thing is always guaranteed. That thing is that the plates and silverware on the table are always dirty. I'm not just talking every once in a while. I'm talking about every single time. We go out of our way every time we come to see if you guys finally learned how to clean. Unfortunately every time we are equally disappointed. Finally I came to the realization today while eating some of your food that if this is how your presentation is on the front end side I can only imagine the practices you have on the back end side. Immediately I dropped the food down on the table and felt sick to my stomach. This is completely unacceptable. This isn't a one time thing. This is an every time thing not just every once in a while. I will continue to pass along my message until this issue is fixed. Unfortunately the good food isn't going to be enough anymore to save my view on this restaurant. How hard can it be to clean your dishes?
