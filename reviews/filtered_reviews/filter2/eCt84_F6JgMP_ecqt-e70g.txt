Stopped in on a Saturday afternoon for happy hour.  In the bar - ordered two REGULAR margaritas at the happy hour price. Server delivered GRANDE margaritas instead (probably because we ordered just one appetizer - when we ordered she said "just that?").  Server had an attitude problem from the get-go.

Not a very pleasant experience.
