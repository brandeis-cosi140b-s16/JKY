Me and a friend ate lunch here... The food was good when it finally came out! Our waiter was consistent on us ordering smaller portions and taco... Our entree took about 40mins to come out... I talk to a manager "Oliver" that was extremely rude, he was giving us attitude and seamed like he wasn't happy to be there.... The staff was being reprimanded by him after the incident! extremely unprofessional the food was great! But this manager made everything uncomfortable.
