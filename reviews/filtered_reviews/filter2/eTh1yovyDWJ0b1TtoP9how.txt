Just not all that impressive from our POV..... ambiance was cozy, comfortable and welcoming but service and food ... meh .  The prime rib was good... halibut was not that fresh tasting (disappointing since the "knowledgeable" server suggested it). The green chili potato .... hmmm.  Well, if you think an uncooked, crunchy pepper the size of a jalapeno filled with a couple of tablespoons of paprika laden mashed potatoes is divine ... then you would be in the right place .  Me? Not so much.

The salad was fine - but then again, you really have to suck to screw up a salad.  The kicker was when I ordered a glass of Chardonnay... then the server returned with a Pinot Noir ....  

We took a couple from out of town who were here on their anniversary.  I told the host when I called to check on the reservation (I made it thru Open Table) and then told the host again when we arrived.  They did absolutely nothing with this information but yet I saw some other table get the special acknowledgement.  What a disappointment, all around.  

Would I go back?  Dunno.... There are many other places here in the valley that we need to experience prior to ever giving these folks our hard-earned casheroo....
