Went to Joyride hoping for a casual taco and a good marg. The restaurant was packed and super noisey. The food was very mediocre. I ordered the beast burritto which sounded tasty on the menu- carne asada, beans, avacado, and two types of salsa.  What they delivered to my table was not so appealing. It was a burrito consisting of 99.9% dry, unflavorful meat, hardly any salsa, beans, or avacado. I ordered a margarita which was very ordinary. The biggest reason I am rating the restaurant so low is because of the rediculously loud music blaring in the restaurant. The place was packed and noisey to begin with and then add the crazy loud music and it made the place almost unbearable. The decor and renovation were done very well. Unfortunately the medicore food and horrible atmosphere will keep me from coming back.
