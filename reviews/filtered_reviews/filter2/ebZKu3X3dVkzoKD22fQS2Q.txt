After a hard couple hours at the tables at the beautiful MGM, my buddy and I needed some food. I was famished. Vegas has this crazy spell it puts on me and I totally forget to eat. I think I get distracted by the shiny objects. But back to Diego's. 
The restaurant was beautiful! It had this modern Spanish style to it. Bright colors and once again those shiny objects that get me all the time! After a quick glance of the menu we decided this will do. During prime business hours we were able to get right in! Always a plus for me. 
The wait staff was very nice and I had myself a margarita. I don't enjoy margaritas to often, but I love them so much! However this margarita was more sour on the rocks then a margarita. Very disappointing. Next, on my slow spiral into Mexican sadness we were offered guacamole. Guac is free at the restaurant I work at, so silly me says sure! Little did I know I'd be paying top dollar for a mashed avocado with out flavor. You live, you learn. 
When our food came we were about ready to die from starvation. It took a little longer then I had anticipated. I was shocked! Not only did my cheese enchiladas look like two sad cheese logs in a pond of enchilada sauce, but all of our food looked so sad. I think they put it under the heat lamp way to long. 
The bill came and being the gentleman my friend is he paid. However I did sneak a peak and was amazed at how much the bill was for how dismal the product was. 
You might want to skip this place if at the MGM. You'll find better food at Chipolte. 
My experience here can be summed up in a quote from David Sedaris, "The food was awful, and there was so little of it".
