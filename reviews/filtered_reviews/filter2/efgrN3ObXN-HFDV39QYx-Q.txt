The customer service was great. I entered and was offered samples of the proteins. I enjoyed all of them. I picked the pork in a burrito. I got home and dug in. Then I was sadly disappointed.  The pork did not have the same flavor. The rice was soggy and not fresh. I didn't finish it. I will not return.
