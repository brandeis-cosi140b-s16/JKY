Boyfriend and I came here on a Friday afternoon around 2pm. The place was pretty empty and the server seated us at a booth. We noticed immediately that there was something weird about the table--it was huge [we couldn't touch hands with our backs against the seats, which isn't conducive to conversations], it came up to the middle of my chest, and it curved. Boyfriend thought the table was just warped, but all the booths were like that! My silverware kept sliding off my plate and into the middle of the table, so we moved. 

The food was fine. I wasn't like blown away by the burrito packed with cheese and veggies. Skip the guacamole--it's super oily. Our beers were served in giant margarita glasses, which I kinda liked. 

The service wasn't great. She didn't come by very often and we never got water. It also took quite a while to get the bill.

We were back in here an hour later because Boyfriend's group of pals showed up. This time we were seated on the patio. The nachos are ridiculously huge, which seems like something that they would point out in the menu. They're definitely meant for sharing as an appetizer and not for a single person to sit down and eat! Haha, it was a mountain of chips, real cheese, nacho cheese, and meant. The 2-for-1 margaritas were decent [strawberry was VERY strong, but I couldn't taste much alcohol in the mango so perhaps it hid the flavor]. 

Our waitress didn't come by very often and we had to go chase after her to get more drinks and our bills. When one of the guys in the group went to go talk to a manager about it, he was given an it's-not-my-problem response. 

Oh, and apparently this place turns into a weird night club. We sent a friend through [she reported back as it being partially filled with mostly dudes] and decided to go elsewhere.
