Pretty disappointed and I really wanted to like this place.  I had the carnitas tacos and the meat had almost no flavor, same for the tortillas which completely fall apart as soon as I picked up the taco.  The beans and rice were just OK. The service and atmosphere were decent, but so what if the food is bland.
