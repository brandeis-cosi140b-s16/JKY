We came to Frijoles hoping to have found a good Mexican place to have a meal, and we found dissapointment! I found Frijoles on yelp and don't believe the hype. This place is not good. My bf had a burrito meal and I had the mini tacos meal. The burrito was dry and so were my tacos. I could've made better tasting tacos at home, they were also bland...The meat had no flavor and it was dry as well. The only good things about our meal were my horchata drink, which wasn't too sweet, it was perfect! The chips were also good and crunchy. Other than that our experience was far from great. Last thing...overly expensive. We could've paid the $20 and would've had a better meal at Los Tacos.
