I try to love Los Tacos, I really do.  It's always packed, which is generally a good sign. But....why is it always packed?  To me, it's kind of "meh."

The Good: They're great because they have so many options.  Seafood, chicken, burritos, chips and salsa -- awesome if you're not in the mood for a street-taco-centric meal (aka Tacos El Gordo).  

The "Meh:" . . . the meat they're cookin' up, at least in my experience, is dry, dry, dry.  I recently ordered the beef combo plate (which comes with 4 corn tortillas, a hefty serving of carne asada, rice, refried beans, lettuce, tomato, avocado, and limes) and was really disappointed. The rice, the beans, the meat, all "blah." The burritos and tacos, however, tend to be better because they're smothered in guacamole and sour cream.

I've never ordered the seafood primarily because the restaurant is a tad dirty and hot.  If you're daring enough, let me know if I'm missing out (or if you got food poisoning)!
