We went to Carlos and Charlies on our last day in Las Vegas. I got there in time for breakfast right before they switched to lunch. I ordered the Mexican Omelette with came with salsa, chorizo, cheese, etc. I ordered the omelette without tomatoes and onions and with a side of potatoes. The waitress brought out my food and it came with beans - so i ordered a side of potatoes. I then went to eat it and realized it was loaded with tomatoes and onions. The restaurant wasn't busy, so I find this frustrating. Because at this point, they were no longer serving breakfast. 

It was okay overall and I ate most of. My friends weren't the biggest fans of their burritos, but they said it was "okay." They only ate half of them. It was a very expensive brunch and we ended up spending about $35 a piece with tip. This did include a $5 bloody mary which was really good. That was the highlight of the meal!

I'd recommend checking out a different place while in Vegas. Sorry Carlos and Charlies, not for me.
