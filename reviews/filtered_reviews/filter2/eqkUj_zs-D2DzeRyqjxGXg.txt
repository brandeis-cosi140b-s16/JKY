It was a very lively atmosphere, but got a little loud and we found it hard to carry on a conversation even when we were sitting right next to each other.  Our waiter was very nice, and attentive, and our food and drinks came quickly.  The margaritas were a little sweet for my taste, and we were disappointed that we couldn't get a frozen margarita in any flavor except mango...not even a classic lime.  The salsa and queso was delicious, and the chicken tacos were good, but my food was lukewarm when it got to the table.  Overall, I'd go back for an early evening happy hour, or try out the lunch menu.
