This was my first visit to Ricardo's as this was where my Mom decided to take me for my birthday dinner.

I had heard both good and bad reviews so I kept an open mind to decide for myself.

It kind of reminds me of the American style Mexican food of El Torito's from back in the day.

I decided to get the steak fajitas and my Mom decided on a combination plate that included an enchilada, taco and chile relleno. The taco was horrible, she took two bites and was done with it, the enchilada was sad however she liked the chile relleno.

I enjoyed the chips and dips they bring out to enjoy prior to your meal being served.

My iced tea was good and I like that they give you a carafe so that you can refill yourself, maybe because the food is a bit dry?

My steak fajitas was not that great, dry and almost too much of that charred burnt taste as I think they really let them sizzle for way to long prior to serving them. The rice and beans were bland and cold. 

I really wanted to like Ricardo's more than I did and it was actually disappointing to say the least.

Well I can scratch this restaurant off my list for places to try and revisit. 

It was my birthday, not sure how they found out but they did bring me a tasty piece of complimentary flan with a candle and sung to me. However as sweet as that was, it was not enough to salvage the poor quality of fake Mexican/Spanish food they serve.

When the complimentary chips and dip is better than the meal, that is not a good sign!
