I feel that I was misled by the high rating of this establishment. I was very disappointed, and rarely say such a thing.... I hate to be the one to do it, but other Yelpers need to know what they are getting into with this place.

The concept sounds great on paper, and I'm certain that it could work well if executed properly, but they have a great deal of culinary improvements to make before they will get any approval from me.

The employees who explained the menu were very friendly people, but the quality of the food, was completely lacking in my opinion.

The majority of the chicken dishes seem to consist of breaded, deep fried, chicked bites, each with a different choice of sauce, and then served over rice which is cooked in a choice of styles or sauces. It is similar to the orange Chicken at Panda Express, but extremely dry and very low quality.

We ordered three diffferent types of their employee recommended chicken and rice dishes, and they all tasted very similar for obvious reasons, but most of the chicken was too dry to eat. It was by no means a satisfying meal.

The mexican side, we had a couple of different tostadas, and i remember one of them being ok, but was nothing special. The quesadillas that we ordered were terrible as well.  I can't remember the last time that we threw away our food at a restaurant, but we left very unsatisfied and ended up happier, eating nachos at the Horse Track..lol

I can see this as being a fun gimmick for little kids who like the idea and have no guage of quality food, but for it being a must try for a Yelper, I give it a two thumbs down. It looks like a school cafeteria in the seating area.

I would be willing to give this place another shot if they step up the quality of their food. I do like the concept and would love to see this concept done right.

Cheers and best wishes!
