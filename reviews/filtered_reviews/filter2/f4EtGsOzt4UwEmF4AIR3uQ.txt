To begin with, I don't understand Cantina 1511's apparent fetish for playing Mexican music at ear-bleeding sound levels. My wife and I were in one mid-week evening after the crowd had departed and were one of only a handful of tables occupied in the entire place. We literally could not hold a conversation sitting 90 degrees from one another at a square table. When we placed our order, we also asked that the music be turned down to a moderate level, and I swear our server was overjoyed to have an excuse to turn it down.

That said, the food was OK, not great. As transplanted Californians, perhaps our standard for "great" is a little higher than someone else's, but the food was serviceable. I just don't think it justified the prices charged. The brutal truth about Mexican food is that, for the staples (enchiladas, burritos, etc), the costs are minimal, the degree of difficulty in preparation is  minuscule, the time required to plate up an order shouldn't take 20-30 minutes, and it shouldn't cost $8 to $10.

That night, the service was rather prompt but other visits we have seen very slow service. And at all times, the damn music was just obnoxious.

I'd return, but only to sit outside, and not anytime soon. To those of you who love Cantina 1511, mazel tov. I'm happy for you. I know there is a better job being done in Charlotte, though.
