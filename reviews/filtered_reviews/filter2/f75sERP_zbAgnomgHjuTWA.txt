Great concept, but way overpriced, tiny portions, and meh flavor.  I ordered 3 dishes with my friends (glass noodles, tuna cerviche, tacos) and were shocked by how small the dishes were.  We would have needed to order 15 items to get even 1/4 full.  The dishes were expensive too.  Each one was $10-$15, and drinks are also pricey.  My 8oz. diet coke was $5!  8oz is smaller than a can!  Our tiny snack ended up costing $65.  

This place is supposed to be chinese/mexican fusion, but we couldn't taste the fusion.  It seems like they just add avocado to any chinese dish and call it chinese mexican fusion.  We were really disappointed.  Skip.
