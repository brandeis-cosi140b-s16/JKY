Mediocre Mexican food. The only thing that I really enjoy here are the sopapias hot and fresh with a little bit of honey. Other than that the food is just your typical concoction of rice,beans,guacamole, tortilla (corn and flour) and some form of meat. This place is located inside the Palms Hotel and Casino which makes it trendy and jacks up the prices significantly.
