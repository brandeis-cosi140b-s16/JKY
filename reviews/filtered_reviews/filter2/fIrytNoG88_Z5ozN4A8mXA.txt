We went there this past weekend.  There are always private parties going on during weekends, so be prepared to wait to get seated.  Once we got seated, we were right in the middle of traffic, which was not very pleasant.  My husband ordered a chimichanga, which he was not impressed with.  I ordered the fish tacos, which were really good.  We do love their salsa and chips.  

In the past we used to come to Aunt Chiladas frequently.  The atmosphere is fun and laid back.  We felt like something had changed this past trip, aside from the menu.  We didn't get that warm fuzzy feeling we used to get while visiting.  I don't think we will be back.
