We've been regulars for a few months now. Have to say the new menu is disappointing. Many of our favorites have been removed. The large plates are overpriced for the amount and quality of food you get. Husband had the duck which he thought was extremely bland. The shrimp entree was ok but would not order again. Overall very disappointing.  In addition to lacklustre food, the service was poor, we waited over 20 mins for our drinks and over 30 mins for our entrees.  We will not be back which is sad because this used to be our go to place. Oh, but the house margarita was still fabulous so if anything this is the place to go for a drink or two.
