Went on Thursday around 6 pm and there was hardly anyone there.  The beer was cold, the guacamole burger was good but I found the rest of the food to be a little bland.  There was a mistake on the order and they fixed it right away.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was friendly.  The seats/tables could use some TLC.  Probably would not return.
