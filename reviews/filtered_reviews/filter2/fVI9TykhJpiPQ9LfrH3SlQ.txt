UGH--the name of this place is just awful.  I would not have chosen this place if I were choosing, but I did not get to choose.  I was in a large group and we waited for EVER to get in--even with a reservation.

I am very picky with Mexican food and to me this was very sub-par.  It is in the Hard Rock hotel which is cool and it is close to the gift shop--so there is some really cool shopping to be done in there.

The chips and salsa were good, but my meal was blah.  I would not go back to the Pink Taco---I just do not swing that way.
