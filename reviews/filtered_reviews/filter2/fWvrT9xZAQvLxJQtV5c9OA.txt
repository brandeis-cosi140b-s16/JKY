This is basically a sports bar with great drinks and plenty of TV 's but if you are looking for good Mexican food, forgetaboutit. The food is barely adequate and quite Americanized. I must say, the chips are great b it the salsa was a little too spicy and they should offer a milder version. It's a good bar but lossy restaurant!
