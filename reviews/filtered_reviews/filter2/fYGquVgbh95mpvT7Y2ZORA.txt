Visited the Old Pueblo for lunch. I had high expectations as was told this was a great place to eat. I ordered the Machaca with rice and beans. I received what looked like a small piece of shoe leather. The taste was ok - but I have had better. Since I am an artist and feast with my eyes first, the appearance of the meat really affected my ability to eat it. It it weren't for the rice and beans helping to cover it up I don't think I could have eaten it. The price was pretty high for lunch - both of my children also ordered lunch and they only ate part of each meal. I don't allow my kids to be picky eaters - the rule is if they order it they have to eat it. I tasted both of the dishes they ordered and both were bland with hot chili sauce the main ingredient. 

The best part of our meal was my friend's margarita (which I sipped on). I could not have one of my own because I was driving.
