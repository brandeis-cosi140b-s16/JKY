Very meh. So let me lead with my bias - I used to live in a heavily Mexican/Salvadorean part of Baltimore city (Highlandtown), and while there ate some of the best Mexican and Latin American food I've ever had. I have also traveled around Mexico, and have experienced both street food and Mexican fine dining. Verde failed at both. Their food lacks flavor, and is not at all true to the spirit of Mexican food. 

I went for lunch one day with a friend, and was sorely saddened by the showing. Their chips were okay, but the salsa was something I could have made much more flavorfully at home. They offered an appetizer with huitlacoche (a flavorful corn mushroom prized in Mexico that has a powerful aroma and strong mushroom flavor). The app did not have even the faintest flavor, whiff, or speck of this mushroom included to my taste. Everything on the menu was overpriced. The sauces reminded me of Boyardee more than the billed fiery tomato and tomatillo I had hoped for. The fillings were either bland or prepared without any understanding of Mexican flavors. Our tacos were acceptable, but I would compare the food quality more to Chili's than Mexican fine dining, which it seems Verde is trying for. 

The mixed drinks we ordered were pretty good, but expensive, and not good enough to improve our overall poor impression.  I guess I expected more at this price range. Won't be returning, at least not for their dinner prices.

If you're looking for tasty Mexican or Latin American food, try anything from Los Palmas to Los Cabos to Reyna's for a better option. Just don't go here and think you're experiencing Latin cuisine.
