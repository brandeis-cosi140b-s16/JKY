Food was very bland. Ordered the breakfast burritos(steak and chorizo) and the blackened chicken nachos. The burritos came with about an 80% ratio of potato to steak and eggs. Don't really think even if the ratios were proportionate that the taste would have been any different. Even adding sauce did not make the meal any more appetizing. The blackened chicken nachos were decent only because of the fresh guac. Gave two stars solely for the guacamole, otherwise water has more flavor then their breakfast burritos.
