Had breakfast here, the food was alright... Over priced and under cooked. I had an omelette... It wasn't very good, super runny. The potatoes and beens however were awesome!!! The service was mediocre at best, not attentive and took forever to get drinks. Not the worst I've ever had, but you're better off spending your money elsewhere.
