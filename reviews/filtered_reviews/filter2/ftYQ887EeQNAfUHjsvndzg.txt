I think this is my first review with less than 3 stars... rough... but i must be honest... It was a lively eatery that caught my eye so I decided to give it a go since my flight was delayed. I ordered the Blue Corn chicken Quesadilla. It was... unsatisfying... the portion was large but I just didn't get the flavor... I also found it a a little odd that if you wanted your order taken you had to flag down someone that worked there that was zipping by. To be fair it was really busy inside.

.::Overall::.

Blue corn Chicken Quesadilla - chicken was dry and didn't have much flavor... the guacamole was kinda bland as well...

.::Recommendation??::.

Maybe the other dishes in the place are better... IMO i would have probably been happier getting a Jr Whopper w/cheese at Burger King haha
