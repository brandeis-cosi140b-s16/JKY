My wife and I have passed this place numerous times this past year and the parking lot was always full,  Well today I purchased a $10 coupon for $1.60 and decided to try the food.  What we have found in our travels is that Mexican food varies greatly from the Chicago area to North Dakota to Denver and now Phoenix.  I really enjoy seafood soup, but have not found it yet, and not here.  I settled for the veggie and meatball soup which was only fair.  THe street tacos were steak and mexican sausage.  Taste was very good, yet they were extremely greasy,  My wife ordered a chimmichanga which had the sour cream and quacamole she loves.  Everything was smothered in sauce and topped with a mound of sour cream.  THe rice and beans were the standard fare served at every Mexican restaurant.  She said it was okay but not great, The best part of our experience was our service.  THe staff was very attentive and our drinks were kept full without asking,  Even now I don't know why the place is always packed after eating there,  One thing I am learning about the Phoenix food scene is that overall food seems to be not on par with what I've had back both in the east and midwest and is generally overpriced,  Overall I'd give Phoenix 2 stars so far for food, but our search continues for good food at fair prices.
