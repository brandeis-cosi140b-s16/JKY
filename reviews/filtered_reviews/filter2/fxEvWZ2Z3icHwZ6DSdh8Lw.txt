Not much needs to be said about a bar devoted to being besotted.

The various signs with catch phrases and college colloquialisms attest to this.  "I like your pants. Especially on my floor," says it all.  

Perhaps a devoted patron of this bar would respond with " Don't take life too seriously, you're not going to make it out alive," another turn of phrase that can be found mounted with Rocky Point pride in this establishment.

The atmosphere is meant to be very casual, laid back - like you were spending your spring break in Puerto Penasco.  But the similarities end there.  Quite possibly home of the worst house margarita - so full of the synthetic and syrupy sweet and sour mix that there is nothing more discernible.  Despite there being a full bar, the bartenders have little knowledge of cocktail recipes - I would recommend ordering beer by the bottle.

Although a full menu is available, there is no better word to describe the food than...bad.  If you have ever had a bonafide street taco in Mexico, then you will be dismally disappointed by their poor imitation.  One would assume that it is quite difficult to mess up a taco, but here they got everything wrong in both the preparation of the meat and the salsa that shamefully tried to mask the poor taste of the meat.  

There is no need to dissect the menu or its gustatory offerings any further, as Dos is quite frankly a place to play beer pong and get wasted.

It does offer a variety of entertainments such as Tuesday comedy nights and Wednesday's Texas hold 'em.  Bean bag tournaments are also held here.

Dos certainly caters to a specific crowd, I am not one of those that feel as though they still want to be on spring break.
