Food taste was great but disappointed in the serving size and server.  Came here with three friends and sat outside.  At the same time we got our chips and salsa, another guy asked if wanted some guacamole.  We looked at each other and said sure.  We thought it was part of the chips and salsa.  When we got the bill they charged us $12.  We all thought they were a little deceptive in how that transaction worked.  Each of us ordered a different taco.  All tasted great BUT in my case the short rib taco had a tiny nugget of meat on it.  I guess when they smoked it for 12 hours it shrunk to nothing.  It was a small taco to begin with but it was stacked high with the garnish.  I would have like more meat on it.  Yah it is probably a cool place to go but next time I would rather go somewhere where the taco's are more substantial.  For what we got it was pricey.
