A bunch of my friends went out on the town one evening and decided to give this new restaurant a chance since we were craving Mexican food. Let me just say it was a disaster! First we started of with table side guacamole made by a lady named Trini. She was very rude and unfriendly. I didn't think you could mess up guacamole but it was just very salty and not very tasty. 

Our server was Daniel and pardon my French but he was a douche. He was not very informative about the menu and rolled his eyes at us quite a few times. His personality was just very rude. The only standout of this place was Eric who delivered our food and even came back to check on us even though he wasn't our server. He's the only one who seemed to care about our table. Definitely keep Eric but the other 2 you could do without. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the food was mediocre.
