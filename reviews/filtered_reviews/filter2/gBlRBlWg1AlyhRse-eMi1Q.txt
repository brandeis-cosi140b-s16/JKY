WaYYYY overpriced! Food is ok nothing to great. The menu was terrible to describe the Chinese food. I ordered the Open Sesame. Was pretty good. The atmosphere gives asian fusion a bad name. If your looking for a place to eat at in the Cosmo, do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else. Your wallet and taste buds will thank you. I will say the customer service was excellent. Nice staff.
