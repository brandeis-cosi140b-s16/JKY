Gave it an extra star for the atmosphere, I like the bar area it's open and relaxing.  Bad service, bad food and overpriced- drinks included.  Ordered the mini chimis and they are very dry and salty, your supposed to dip it in their flavored butter what ever it is that's not good.  I'd rather just get sour cream with it.  The margarita for two is huge, but got it over ice and that's what you get, ice.  Their food doesn't come close to anything that resembles mexican.
