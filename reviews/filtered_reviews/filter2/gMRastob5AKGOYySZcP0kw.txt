Husband and I had lunch on the patio. It was a beautiful day outside and we had a very nice server. I was considering ordering a dozen of their green corn tamales for my holiday dinner but wanted to try them first. I had not had tamales since I was a child and remembered them being served in corn husks. I ordered the tamales as an appetizer and my husband ordered carne asada fajitas to share. It took a little time for the food to come . When it did the server warned us that the plates were scalding hot. I had read on Yelp that the plates were hot but the food was not. So I touched my tamale with my finger and sure enough it was room temperature. I mentioned it to the server and she apologized and whisked it away. In the meantime my husband's fajitas were dried out and flavorless. The steak had been grilled but was absolutely tasteless with no seasoning. The green peppers and onions had been over cooked almost to a pulp. The guacamole was delicious. The tortillas were gummy and the homemade chips were doughy and a bit greasy.

The server returned with my tamales in less than 5 minutes and they were piping hot. They had obviously been microwaved. To my disappointment they were not wrapped in corn husks and steamed as I remembered tamales. They were like little cakes with a very small amount of green chili and corn stuffing. Very sweet and tasted more like a dessert than an appetizer. 

Overall a bad dining experience. The only nice things were the patio and the server. The food sucked!
