Bland. Overpriced. Great vibe and cool spot for drinks, and I mean cold, so bring a jacket.

#carne asada burro was a bean burro with a few a slivers of meat. At $15 I expected more.
##red rice bland and boring. 
#black beans same.
#fish tacos mush. Were they fried? Breaded? Who knows!
#house margarita boring, too much ice.
Not sure why (probably because it was just so boring), but I was distracted by the ice-machine ice. Very firm, doesnt melt, decreases the drink volume, done in 4 gulps. Taffer would be proud.

Rubio's easily puts Sol to shame.

Ho hum.
