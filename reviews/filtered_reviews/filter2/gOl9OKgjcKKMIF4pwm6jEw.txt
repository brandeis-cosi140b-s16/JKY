These aren't the best tacos around, but they are open 24 hours and I prefer them to Roberto's. The night we dined in the restaurant was packed. There was one cook, one cashier and one other lady attending to odds and ends. There must have been a dozen people waiting for their order before we received ours. We sampled a trio of carnitas, carne asada and al pastor. Each held up and no tough pieces were found. The dining area is awkward and it was pretty dirty on our visit. It's not a place to go out of your way for, but it is not a bad late night option.
