First time at Frank & Lupes in old town Scottsdale, heard this place can make a mean margarita, but I did not see any being made tonight....to say the least I was sort of stuck here, due to some prick of a cop....but that's another story.

Walked into this place and it was quite busy, was actually quite surprised on how busy it was for 7pm on a Weds night. Lots of College football fans in their gear due to the game between the ducks and Auburn the day before, so I am assuming most of them were tourist.

There was no hostess, and after looking around I decided to mosey up to an empty stool at the bar, took the bartender/waiter a minute to see me, but once he did he was on top of things. 

Got a Corona and my chip and salsa on, not a big fan of the authentic chips, and the salsa was a bit watery, I got an extra side of sour cream and guacamole, the guacamole was good, large chunks of avocado in it. Sour cream was your run of the mill, after looking over the unimpressive and hard to read lettering on the menu...due to poor design.

I decided after the chips maybe just to stick with what I had, so I got the nacho supreme with chicken. To say the least I was not impresses with any part of this dish except for the fact that it was huge...and the chicken was good...but there was not enough of it. 

Total tab came to almost $25.00 for one beer and nacho supreme and a little extra sour cream and guacamole...RIP OFF!!!

Could of got better nacho's at Filberto's in Phoenix for way cheaper.

I would be willing to give this place another shot but to say the least I was not very impressed with it on this visit due to the lackluster food and high prices!
