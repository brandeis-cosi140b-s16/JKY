Went here with my family. The service was slow and horrible. The bus person came by to take our drink order. When she returned, our drink order was incorrect. When our waiter came by to take our order, he was testy with us. We all ordered combination platters. The food was on the bland side and my enchiladas were over cooked. I took my eyes off my margarita for a moment and the bus person removed it (I wasn't done with it). When the waiter came by with the check, he hovered over my mom while she was getting her credit card out of her wallet. I've never had a server do that ever!! Then my mom was finishing her margarita and the waiter swooped in like a vulture to grab the signed check from her. The service was extremely slow in here, but come time to pay your bill, they're on top of you and practically pushing you out the door. The only positives to this place are the margaritas and "complimentary" chips, salsa, bean dip, and guac. The food is overpriced for what you get. I am disgusted by how we were treated by the staff and have no desire to return ever!!
