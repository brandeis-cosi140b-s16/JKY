This is not even based on the food, but the fact that a grown man behind the counter said to his staff at least 6 different times out loud "I'd appreciate it if you all would shut the f#$& up", speaking to everyone working behind him. This all while myself and another person ordered and waited for our food. Disrespectful to those he's working with and they don't deserve that.
