My slow initiation into Phoenix and slowly Arizona as a whole is progressing, what better way to do that than to check out this Guy Fieri "Triple D" hot spot.

Sketchy lot, run down interior, decent pricing and variety of samples at the counter. Sounds like a legit place in my book especially when it comes to Mexican, however this pride and joy of Phoenix left a lot to be desired.

As suggested by many on Yelp and a fellow Arizonian friend  I got the Red Jade Chicken, Pork Fried Rice and Refried Beans. 

Red Jade Chicken- like orange chicken, just more tomato flavor
Pork Fried Rice- Nothing special
Carnitas- Good texture of pork, seasoned well, but lacking in flavor dimension
Refried Beans- Wasn't a big fan
Snickerdoodle- everything!

Just an A-OK for me because of the Red Jade Chicken and free, amazing Snickerdoodle cookie given with the meal. Pricing seems a bit steep for just two entrees, beans and rice plus a fountain drink ~$10 I'd honestly just go to Panda Express, where it's about the same price, cleaner and have an easier ordering system. 

However, if you're looking for a place that will fill you up and to go crazy on the endless combinations you can make- you'll be able to do that here. Would I come back? Most likely not.
