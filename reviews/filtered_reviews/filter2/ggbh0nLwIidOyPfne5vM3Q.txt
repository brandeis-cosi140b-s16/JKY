I dragged some friends here as I have been a long time fan of the Two Hot Tamales. Unfortunately, we were let down with atrocious service and forgettable food. My carnitas would have been acceptable for $7.95 at a chain restaurant, but for $23 a plate I should get something at least as good as a taco truck. After we had been there for over twenty minutes our server literally forgot about us - he actually began to reintroduce himself and ask for our orders.

Two stars only because our drinks were terrific. The cucumber mojito was done perfectly and my companions' strawberry margaritas got rave reviews.
