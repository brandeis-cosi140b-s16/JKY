We visited Border Grill this past week while in Las Vegas for a quick family getaway.  We were there for dinner on a Thursday night, we had reservations. We have two teenage kids and found it odd instead of seating us in the main dining room, (with several empty tables) we were escorted down a flight of stairs to a large room.  There was a large party, as well as another family with one child.  Perhaps this is reserved for families?  Not sure.  We were seated in a corner, so not the best seating.  The hostess handed our teenage kids crayons and paper.  Kids were amused, but found it odd.  As far as the food, my husband enjoyed his skirt steak.  It was over-priced, but expected.  I ordered a caesar salad and the plantain empanadas.  The salad was stale, and mostly croutons.  Also stale.  The empanadas were good, but not great.  I think my son had the best meal.  He raved about the fresh tortillas with his burrito.  Service was also subpar.  Never saw the server.  Tried to find her at one point so we could get a refill on our tea.  We had a great experience (food & service) a few years back at Border Grill, this is why we returned.  After this experience, I do not think we will return.
