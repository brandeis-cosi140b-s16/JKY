My mom goes do dialysis next door to this place three times a week. I have only ordered food once but what I got wasn't even close to what I ordered. I do go in to grab a soda every now and then. Almost 3 bucks seems a bit high but whatever. I wish they would let me at least grab a free refill or something but the rule is "once you go outside you have to pay for more drink". Rules are rules I guess. The girl at the counter could have been nicer about it.
