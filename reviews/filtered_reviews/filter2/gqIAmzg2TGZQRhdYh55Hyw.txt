We only came here because everyone was hungry and the prices at Cheeseburger (a close by restaurant) looked a little high.

Turns out the prices at this place are higher and the food was probably not as good as it would have been if we went somewhere else!
I wasn't very hungry so I just got a Mexican Pizza (appetizer).  I paid way too much (over $10) for a burnt, flavorless pizza.  

Taco Bell has better food than this place!!

I wouldn't go back!!!  And I don't recommend anyone else go!
