Overpriced food. Overpriced drinks. EVEN DURING HAPPY HOUR! The servers tell you you're getting a good deal on the happy hour because its 2 for 1 and then you find out the yards are cheaper... GREAT.

My friends and I split two appetizer platters since it was half off and they were meh. I mean $15 dollars half off is STILL expensive.. I can't even believe that the appetizer platter is $30 regularly... Maybe I'm not a big fan of fried food or cheese, but I definitely have had better. Definitely won't be coming back here again.

Don't fall into the happy hour trap! Go get a fat tuesday instead!
