Gave them another chance since the meatball soup, salmon, and leche cake were solid. How they screwed up fajitas and guac is beyond me, but we wanted to like it and gave it another try.

Mistake. 30 min wait With a reservation. Chicken dry as a bone. Quesadilla awful. Ground beef burrito ok. And our main reason for coming back, the leche cake... An epic fail! Dry cake! So disappointed since it was truly life changing last time.
