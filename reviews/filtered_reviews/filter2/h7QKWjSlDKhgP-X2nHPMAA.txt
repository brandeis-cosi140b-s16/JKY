It's just kinda ok. Drinks aren't that great. I mean stick to beer. A bartender can't mess up a beer. Mixed drinks were weak. Seemed like the place was too busy for on hands to deal with. Mixed drinks are too pricey for what u get. It's not good Mexican food either. Its just ok Americanized Mexican food. When u walk into a Mexican restaurant and the lady working there gives u attitude cuz she needs to serve you during her novelas that's a Mexican restaurant.  But its locations cool. There's just too many places too eat in Vegas. Not worth it bros.
