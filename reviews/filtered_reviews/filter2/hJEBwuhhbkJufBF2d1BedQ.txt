I was on my way to the strip last friday night, and ran into some traffic.  As I was passing the Palm, I saw the sign for Gardunos, so I decided to check it out.  The wait was about 20 minutes, which wasn't too long, and the food came out quickly.  

Our server was attentive until the food came, and then she disappeared for about an hour.  I wouldn't consider this the best Mexican restaurant, but it's ok.  The fajitas were of sirloin instead of the usual flat iron steak, so I was a little disappointed when it tasted more like stir-fry.  The machaca tacos and the handmade chicken tamales were good.

It's about as good as a Chevy's, Don Pablos, or On the Border
