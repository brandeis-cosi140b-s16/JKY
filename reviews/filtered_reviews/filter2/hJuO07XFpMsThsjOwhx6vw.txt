Although the place is beautiful, the food was horrible. Worst salsa EVER, it tasted store bought. The fish taco was barely edible, poor quality fish and it was $11. I ordered a Patron margarita, since I like tequila, and it tasted like water! We told the waitress, and she got me a new one, but it was only slightly better and I still don't think it was Patron. They charge for chips & salsa...the food is expensive and they charge for chips too?? Would not go back!!!
