Used to like this place a lot because it was a convenient spot to eat between classes and is pretty healthy. Yesterday I went there and ordered my usual fish rice bowl and unfortunately I got terrible food poisoning from it. This is obviously a sign that either freshness of the meat or hygiene is not up to par. It will never be worth it for me to go again after going through the sickness that I have in the oases 24 hours
