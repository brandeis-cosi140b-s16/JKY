We decided to try there food on Sunday ,we ordered our food and the waiter was really nice no complaints at all. The food took a long time to come out and was cold and soggy .We send it back sent the second time a steak taco came out ice cold. The prices were to expensive and I won't go back. I felt bad for the server he really tried.
