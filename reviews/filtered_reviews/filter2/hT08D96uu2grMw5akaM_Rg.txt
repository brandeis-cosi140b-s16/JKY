I had been excited to try this new restaurant and had read good reviews of the Scottsdale location.  It's a cute room and because my companion and I went for lunch mid-week, we only waited about 10 minutes.  While I saw numerous staff around, our poor waitress was clearly spread too thin and was scrambling to get to each of her tables.  Having the waitress prepare the table-side guacamole at three tables during the time were were there didn't help the situation and further slowed down service.  We waited about 15 minutes before our waitress took a drink order.  We had to ask twice for chips and salsa, not to mention water.  The chips were stale, thick and cold (I prefer thin, fresh,warm and crispy).   The salsa had absolutely no flavor or heat.  It couldn't have been more bland.  My companion ordered three tacos.  They were the small street taco size and he said they were good.  I had the Queen enchiladas with shrimp and, although the shrimp were smaller than the waitress described, the dish was delicious.  I also ordered a pineapple agua fresca which was tasty.  My companion found the beer selection to be limited to only relatively cheap Mexican beers.  I will return to give Barrio Queen another chance but I have a feeling this may not be my favorite Mexican restaurant.
