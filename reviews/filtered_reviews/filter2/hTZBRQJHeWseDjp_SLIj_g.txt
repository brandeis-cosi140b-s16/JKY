I've tried.  I hate not positively giving love to a business but I have tried Nacho Daddy at least 5 times for various reasons.  I have attended shows at the Henderson location.  I have had a business meeting there.  I've simply gone there on Date night.  I just cannot say I have ever liked any of the food that I have tried.  I've everything from the Nachos to the enchiladas and it just wasn't for me.  It's a hair pricier.  Not terribly, but a hair.  Maybe I just think that because I would have rather not spent the money on something I didn't like.  

But I did try.  The reason it gets at least another star is because the staff has always been good to me, the atmosphere, the look of the place, and even just the cleanliness of the restaurants, are important to me.  I won't be rushing back at all, but with all the advertising and billboards they have, they must be doing something right.  I'm just not a fan.
