I would have given this place 3 stars but they don't advertise on their website or menu that you only get one complimentary basket of chips and one small dish of salsa. If you want more that'll be $2.00 each time they bring you more. This was pretty much the theme of the night. I ordered the fajitas which didn't come with any cheese or lettuce, so I ordered some on the side at a cost of $1.00 each for these little cups of it. The fajita entree was $15.00 to begin with so I seriously think they could give you some cheese and lettuce to put on your tortilla. They brought me 4 tortillas with the entree and when I asked for more our waitress brought 2 for another $1.00. It might just be me but $1.00 for two corn tortillas is a bit steep. Besides for the prices this place was pretty good. It was a bit noisy but clean and the food was good just not for the price. For 3 people the bill ended up being $65.00 with one appetizer, three entrees and no drinks since we all drank water.
