I had the carnitas burrito, my husband had the carnitas bowl. Both with the hot sauce, but not the hottest sauce. Service was really friendly, and portions were good but the food itself was greasy and not very flavourful. I've eaten a lot of good and bad Mexican food all over North America and this place is neither. Probably pretty good if you're drunk and it's open late, and again the staff was so nice. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, but I would if I was hungry and someone I was with wanted to go. I'd just try something different, and a hotter (and extra) sauce. 

For late night on that part of the strip I would recommend secret pizza at the cosmopolitan.
