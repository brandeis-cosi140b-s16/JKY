Mixed review: chips and salsa were good, atmosphere good. I was told by my party that the chicken was good in the enchilada. My food, vegetarian burrito/cheese enchilada combo, was really basic and had no imagination in flavor. I was hoping to get a taqueria style burrito but what I got was small and boring flavor. The guacamole was tasteless and frozen, previously made. It was shameful that they serve that. Outdoor seating option was cool and it was very popular.
