My husband and I are locals and bought a groupon and decided to try this place out. We were quickly seated at the bar stools that overlook the strip. Perfect since my husband loves to people watch. First, we ordered a margarita. I asked her if there were any drinks they were special for and she said everything so I got strawberry. Probably the worst margarita I've had lately. Then, we ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer. Again, awful. The chips were really hard and tasted stale. We got some type of quesadilla that was pretty good. Overall the service and food was pretty decent. I'm a pretty harsh critic. I would have given 3 stars but it was getting cold and we asked for the bill and she said she would be right back for the groupon. It took about 5 minutes for her return. She finally took my phone and disappeared for another 10 minutes. She didn't give me a book with my receipt so there was nowhere to put my money. So this place was ok, but I definitely will not be going there again. But if you have a groupon, it's worth it if you don't feel like traveling far and you're in that area.
