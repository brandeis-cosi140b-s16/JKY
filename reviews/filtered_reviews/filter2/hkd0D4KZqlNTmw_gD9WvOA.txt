Purchased a Groupon ($20 for $40 deal) for Milagro Grill. I've been wanting to try this place out for awhile now. 

Came here for dinner with my husband on a Tuesday. The place is modern and clean. There was one other table of customers and a couple at the bar. 

Our waiter was friendly and provided recommendations. Although he failed to mention the $2 taco special. That would have been nice to know. I ordered the Costilla entree and my husband ordered the swordfish. The Costilla came out looking pretty, but the taste was a bland BBQ seasoning. Your average BBQ beef on corn grits. My husband's swordfish was dry and overpowered by the spiciness of the beans it came with.  I added some of his beans to my plate to give my food more flavor. 

With the side if chips, two margaritas and two entrees, our bill was $32 (with Groupon discount) add the tip and $20 I paid for the Groupon, it was still a sizable amount for what we got. 

Overall we were not impressed with the flavor, quantity of food and definitely feel it was overpriced.
