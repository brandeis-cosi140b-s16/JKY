This used to be one of my favorite places for Mexican and a great fun atmosphere.  BUT, the last 2 times I've eaten here the food has been average, the ice tea horrible, and the service so slow.  My drink came right away but the tea was so bitter I couldn't drink it.  My food was dropped off and I was half way through before anyone stopped by.  I asked for a different drink and had to ask for a napkin.  When I was completely done eating (and had been out of a drink for at least 15 minutes) did the waitress check on me.  And there was only 1 other table with people inside.   The waitress was very friendly, though and my food was good this time. The last time I was here it took 20 minutes to get our check back from the waitress so we could pay and again it wasn't busy in there. Plus our food was burned.  I had hoped for better service this time but it didn't happen.
