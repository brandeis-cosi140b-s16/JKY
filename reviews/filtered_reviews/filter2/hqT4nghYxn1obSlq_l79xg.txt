I don't understand the fuss over this place. Yes, the tortillas are fresh and the family story is compelling, but my group agreed that the food was just OK, with a rather limited menu to boot. The restaurant interior itself is minimal bordering on unpleasant. Maybe the original location is better. We have no reason to return to this one.
