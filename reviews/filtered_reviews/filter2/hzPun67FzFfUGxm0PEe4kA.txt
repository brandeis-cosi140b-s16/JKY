My boyfriend is from Huntington Beach, CA and he was raving about Wahoo's for a while.  We finally decided to try it and i was surprised at how BAD it was.  I will admit, i am a bit of a snob when it comes to food (not price-wise, but taste-wise), but this was really really disappointing.  We ordered two combo platters -- one fish tacos and one burrito platter to go.  Upon arriving home we discovered that there was no burrito and they gave us two taco platters instead....oh well....$1.50 price difference wasnt worth the drive back.  Tacos were tasteless, fish was dry and not seasoned, even salsa was bland.  White rice was OK, but then you have to really try to mess that up.  I dont think that i will be eating here again.  Tacos Mexico on Trop. blows this place out of the water and they use fish sticks!!!!!
