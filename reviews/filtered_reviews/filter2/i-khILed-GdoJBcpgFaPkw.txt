I had high hopes for this place since I have visited here before. 

I ordered the taco salad with chicken. When it came out the cheese looked un appetizing, The tortilla bowl they served my guac and sour cream in was already soaking from the chicken juice. The salad was warm and soggy. 

I also had to get up to ask for more water after she had stopped by to see how everyone was doing drink wise. 

Hopefully this can be improved. I will not be ordering this dish again.
