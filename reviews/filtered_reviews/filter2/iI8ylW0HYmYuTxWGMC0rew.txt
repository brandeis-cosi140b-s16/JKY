The quality of the food is always trumped by the absolutely terrible service. My orders have constantly been wrong, cold, and over charged and the staff comes across as completely apathetic. The only reason this location gets the second star is that the location does seem to be clean and well presented, but it truly is a gilded facade and nothing more.
