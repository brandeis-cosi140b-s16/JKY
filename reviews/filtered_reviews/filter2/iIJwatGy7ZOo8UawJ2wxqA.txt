My husband and I don't always pool party but when we do, he needs food.

We actually were staying at the Saguaro for a night over Memorial Day weekend so the pool was lively with music which goes very well with drinks which is how we got involved with this spot.

Tacos, salads, taco salads. Mexican foods and normal fare poolside with delivery to your chair (or not).

We ordered pitchers of mojito - or was it margarita? In reality it was possibly both - one after the other - because when billing to the room, who's really counting anyway? 

I think we likely could have gone into the restaurant at other points in our stay but really poolside dining + a nap suited us much better.

I think I'd probably skip it next time if I could - it was all a bit over priced and not tasty enough to merit the cost.

There's too many other good spots!
