I didn't think Diablo would be a good choice for lunch after reading about 50 of their reviews but others in our group wanted to go. The reviews are correct. We left with the feeling we paid way to much considering the food & service we received. Huge lack off attention to us and other customers around us. I would say you have a 50% chance of leaving happy.
