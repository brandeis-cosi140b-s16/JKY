Not worth the hype. All the praise must be from people who don't know good Mexican food. The torta at Los Toquitos is hands down better. Sad to say, even Filibertos torta is probably better. The beans taste like doctored up canned beans and the rice is very plain. Good Mexican food in the Phoenix area is Guadalajara Comedor, Poncho's on S. Central, Los Toquitos and Rosita's Place on McDowell. Los Reyes, take a que from them.
