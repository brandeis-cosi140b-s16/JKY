I've been stoked to try Chayo since the Linq opened (after seeing the restaurant on one of my favorite tv shows in California). 

I dined Saturday July 12, 2014 for the first and last time.

Our server started out very attentive and inquired if we were ready to order frequently. (there may have been ten tables)

A gentleman with a large tray which appears to be some of the items I may have ordered comes out and circles my booth but doesn't make any eye contact. He circles the area a second time before placing my food on someone else's table. I acknowledged the server and of course he picked the food up and brought it to me. Another server comes out and does the exact same thing to me and my guest a second time.

No one fills the water or even comes back after the mix up the remainder of our lunch. The restaurant was nearly empty you would think these types of errors wouldn't occur! 

I was highly displeased with the lack of service and mediocre foods especially  after having another guest served my food before brining it to my table!

$50 for decent shrimp ceviche, excellent chips and guacamole, terrible empanadas, and a yummy Sangria! 

My lunch date enjoyed her $15 lobsters and I must admit they looked delish too!!!

I will not recommend nor return to this location but I would try in another city!
