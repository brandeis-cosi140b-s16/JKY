I've gotten sick from food here 3 times.  The pattern I've noticed is that if the workers look bored/tired (2am-7am), they're probably being sloppy on food safety, as I've gotten sick EVERY TIME in this scenario.  The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is that the food is actually admittedly pretty good and is the closest thing in my area to being like the Mexican food from San Diego, and so I still keep coming back here while taking a risk every time lol.
