We went to this Mexican establishment last Sunday night and we ordered the organic margaritas and we could taste any tequila and they put so much soda water in this drink it tasted like a soda. I ordered the taco combo, one ahi taco which was good however the crispy chicken taco was very bland and tasteless. The rice tasted old and you can tell they put it on the grill to reheat because it had burnt patches ...yuk! Over all I wouldn't spend the $$ to eat here again.
