Service was fine, food tasted fine, prices were cheap. Was not a fan of the rice having peas and carrots in it... I expect that at a Chinese restaurant but can't stand it in a chimichanga. Also, as I was finishing my meal, I saw a cockroach crawl out of a crack in the wall and then crawl back in. NOPE CYA.
