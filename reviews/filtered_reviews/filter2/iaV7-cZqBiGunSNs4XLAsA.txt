The service was absolutely HORRIBLE! My friend and I went there for drinks and dancing on their Latin night. As we walked up, the guy at the door stared at us for a minute, so we pulled our IDs out of our purse. He didn't even look at them, he simply asked if we were going to sit and eat or just get drinks. We said we were going to just have a few drinks, and he said, "Ok, just go in." We had seen on 2 different websites, one being their own, that they had a happy hour/drink specials on Friday and Saturday nights, so we asked the girl behind the bar what those were. She was only on her 2nd night of working there, so she went to ask a "manager." He told her there weren't any specials. We asked to speak with him, so he came over with an attitude and proceeded to be extremely rude in telling us he'd do 2-for-1 margaritas since we were showing him the advertisement, but that they've never had specials on Friday night. We showed him the 2nd ad and he rolled his eyes and said, "What did I just tell you?!" He then said we'd have to ask a manager about the ads...the girl had told us he was the bar manager. Then a few minutes later a security guy comes over and rudely tells my friend and I that we "have to get off the chairs" at the bar because he was going to take them upstairs. The only nice people there were the guy running the mechanical bull and the girl who had just started working there. The music was good. The drinks were gross. I doubt we'll ever go there again.
