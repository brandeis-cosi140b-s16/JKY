Customer service and management was horrible. It took an hour for us to get an appetizer of mini chimis, rice and beans. That was all we ordered. The table next to us who sat AFTER us, ordered AFTER and had a LARGER party with more complex meals got served BEFORE us. In fact, the were almost done by the time our food came. We had to send the food back when it came because it was room temp/cold when we got it. Managements excuses were, "it depends what side of the menu you order from because we're backed up on the appetizers". And the other excuse was, "their are more of you than there is of us". The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because the manager took half off the meal. I won't be back. Baja sauce and good drinks aren't enough to get me in the door if the service is sucky.
