While we were excited to try Taco Haus, we were very disappointed by the food and the margaritas. While the service was great, the food was tasteless. We paid for the high end  tequila in our margaritas but unfortunately could not taste a bit of it. We sent them back and received what we were told were "much stronger" margaritas, however they tasted very watered down.
