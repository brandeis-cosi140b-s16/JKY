I have one main criteria for rating any sort of "mexican" restaurant, and that is how they prepare the chicken.  Unfortunately, this place failed my test.  The chicken in the tacos merely tasted like chicken, and it was a sizable hunk of fairly dry breast that I had to chew through.  With all the stuff included in the taco, I still found myself reaching for the cholula  to give it some moisture and taste.  My tablemates had "heat" issues with the salsa that came with the chips and I have to admit I couldn't dunk as freely as I like.  A burrito ordered came smothered and I mean smothered in a green chili sauce (looked like typical salsa verde and not green chilis).  He had to scrape it all off.  So, the end result is I will probably not go back.  We were forced there by the huge crowd across the street at Postinos and apparently Joyride is owned by the same folks.  I guess if you charge high enough prices the undiscriminating crowd here in Phoenix will just assume it must be great.  Not me!
