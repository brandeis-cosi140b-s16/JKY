A Chinese and Mexican combo restaurant... concept: interesting, execution: not so great.

Definitely definitely overpriced. Seriously, 6 pieces of dim sum for $18? I don't care if it has gold flake on it! Las Vegas highway robbery...

I ended up having two tacos, the pollo with mole and the pork. They were both tasty (and tiny) but I was left wishing for some citrus or some crunchy cabbage. Depending on the taco you order, ONE taco can range from $4-$10, FYI.

Cute decor and seating though.

Conveniently located right next to the entry for Marquee.
