My rice and beans were cold. Yuck. 

The bar vibe is cool. We went there for a birthday - well as tag-alongs to our other friend. Service was okay, but I was very intrigued by the HUGE margarita... $49!! but it was HUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGEEEEEE.... 

It was difficult to get refills but an ok night experience overall.
