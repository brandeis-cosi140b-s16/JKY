My husband and I have been going to this restaurant several years, and have always been happy with the service, however in the past few months, the service has declined. My last visit was horrible. I ordered the wet burrito, and was told it came with pico de gallo and guacamole. I asked to substitute chopped tomato and onion for the pico de gallo and sliced avocado for the guacamole. The waiter seemed hesitant with my substitution request, but took my order anyway. My order came with the sliced avocado, but not the tomato or onion. I talked to my waiter, and he went to get it corrected. He returned, and said that he made a mistake, the pico de gallo was not included in the burrito, so the change could not be made. I asked him to please have my order prepared the way I requested it, and to make it to go. In the meantime, my napkin fell to the floor, someone picked it up, but did not bring me a new napkin. I voiced my concern to the manager, and the best she could do was to give me 20% off.  I felt that was the final insult and have no plans to return to the restaurant.
Their food is excellent. The chefs are always consistent with the quality of the meals. 
If I do go back there, my order will be to go.
