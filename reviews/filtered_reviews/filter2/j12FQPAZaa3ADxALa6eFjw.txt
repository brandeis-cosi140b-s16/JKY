What the heck happened!? The past few times we've been here (during the month of October), our al pastor tacos were dripped in grease/oil!!!! It was disgusting. Very unappetizing! =/ Which is disappointing because my boyfriend and I LOVEEEEE Taco y Taco. I don't know if it varies between cooks and the person preparing the tacos but PLEASEEEE.....do not drench the tortilla in the al pastor grease. The past few times we saw the person making our tacos drag our tortillas across the meat grease catcher. Another time, we saw the pile of tortillas sitting under the slab of meat and the grease was constantly dripping down making the tortillas all soggy. Yuck! =/

I think it's time to officially take a break from this place. Back to Tacos El Gordo we go...even if we have to stand in their looong line.
