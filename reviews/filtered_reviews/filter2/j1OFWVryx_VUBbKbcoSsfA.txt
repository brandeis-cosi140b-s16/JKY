I wanted to like this Vegas spot inside Mandalay Bay. Cool vibe, great decor and good drinks but the praise stops there. The menu outlined flavorful sauces and fresh ingredients but the meals disappointed.

My mole chicken didn't have any flavor and nothing that resembled mole sauce. It was dry and had no spices. 

One colleague ordered the habernero steak and lobster and it was bland. They said the pepper flavor was in the butter but both were hardly noticeable. They brought him the "hottest sauce" in the restaurant and it was awful. I have had jar salsa with more zing. 

Definitely not worth the price..
