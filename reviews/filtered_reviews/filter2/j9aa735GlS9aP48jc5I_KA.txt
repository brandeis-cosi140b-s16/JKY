I agree with PS, way overrated.  And you'd think after all the years and the money this place makes it would refurbish the booth seats--they seem like the same since the 80's!  Salsa flavor was off, something missing like an herb, epazote?, and the chips, maybe its the GMO corn used to produce them, they just don't taste real.  The margarita was so acidic that by the second sip I couldn't drink anymore.  Service is also very complacent.  Cute little chile tepin bush in the planter next to the front door.
