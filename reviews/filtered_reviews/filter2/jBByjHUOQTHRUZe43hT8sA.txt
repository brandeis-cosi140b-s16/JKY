Tortilla soup looked great but had very weak broth--salsas were average at best,achiote fried tilipia was good, nice flavor, if the tacos lived up to the descriptions it would have been a great meal but it once again flavors were lacking---great concept but poor execution

drinks were well done and beer was good
