With expectations sufficiently low and my objections to walking into a two-star airport eatery where it took three tables to find a clean four-top, we tried it, as the good Mexi food joint identified as Concourse C is apparently only available to the folks who work on the tarmac (Roach coach) . 

In spite of the hungover bitching by the pocket-pict Yelpers leaving the Land of the Lost, the service was remarkably good. 

The food?  What's the right word?

Ewwww.

Yep. That's it. That's one star Guacamole was frozen ballpark blend and the chips aren't made here but with a few margaritas it might stop the complaints. 

The food was bland but not deadly. The table next to us had to leave when their food flew off with Amelia Earhardt into the Bermuda Triangle never to be seen, with profuse apologies from the waitress as to the ticket's disappearance in the kitchen. 

The place had a fun look, but the floors are filthy at 9am and many of the tables could use a refresh with chipped paint and worn edges. 

Stars: Food one. Server one. Management -3
