Never had a problem with Chipotle until the other day my coworkers and I ordered our lunch online. Through their website you can name the orders, make any specific notes, and pay/set pick up time. We had 5 people's orders submitted, some of which had notes mentioning to add both beans, both rices, or items on side because you can only choose one option when ordering. When we picked it up and got back to work it appeared they completely ignored the notes. Any modifications we had made to our order was just left off. It was almost embarrassing to have paid for everyone's food, tell them how easy it was to order online, and when we receive it seem as if they didn't pay attention. I always enjoy going by myself and ordering in person, but hate to say the online process left a bad taste in my mouth and won't be ordering for groups anymore from Chipotle.
