The food here was pretty good.  I really liked how they mixed Chinese and Mexican food together on one menu, I thought that was pretty cool.  The service was good too! The only thing I really didn't like was the portion size.  I felt like it was super small for the price.  I came here with a friend and we split the Dan Dan noodles and an enchilada dish.  The food was good, but we were still hungry after we left.  I recommend the non alcoholic drink on the back of the menu ( I think it was called fresca?) it was good, but a little overpriced.
