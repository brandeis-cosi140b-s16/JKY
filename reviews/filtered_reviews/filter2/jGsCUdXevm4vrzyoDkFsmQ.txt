I would have given this place my first one star rating if it wasn't for the free lime Margarita with salt (free with lunch special) - It's making my mouth water just thinking about it... 
1st star- It's free / 2nd star- It's lime with salt around the rim =2 stars!!!
The first clue to me as to if a Mexican restaurant will be good or not is if the tortilla chips and flour tortillas are good, I mean if a Mexican restaurant can't get these 2 regular items correct then I know the rest of the food will most likely not taste good and as always I was right...
There is not much taste in any dish that I have tried there(because of my parents I have eaten there a few times). The last thing I tried was Pollo Baldastano ( Chicken breast stuffed with ham & cheese then ovenbaked with a pepper sauce) - Sounds hellah good huh? Well it tasted like cafeteria food... Don't expect too much from this place - 
I don't...
