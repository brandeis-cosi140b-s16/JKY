In Vegas for a Girls' weekend and was super excited we had reservations for a Rick Bayless place.

Mundo is in a design center...somewhat strange locale but the restaurant is 'Latin Chic," we went with it.   We all got super excited when we saw "Mexican Corn" on the menu.  To be fair, this is out great expectation to another experience we had in NYC with mexican corn at a little hole in the wall place...AND this is Rick Bayless IT MUST BE EVEN BETTER! (wait for it....)

The "MEH."  (Would have been aokay at 3 stars)
1.  The sangria was tasty, none of us could get a buzz off of it.
2.  The Mexican corn came out...and it was waaaay too rich.  There was waayyy too much cream/cheese in it to really enjoy it.  Had it been a bit lighter, we would have inhaled it.
3.  Carnitas...had better.  RB didn't revolutionalize or improve upon it. Sadly...meh.

The Grr.... (minus the 1 star)
Service:  overall all the servers were friendly.  However dropped a few balls which wasn't such a huge deal...but don't lie to me about a $2 cup of coffee.

- Initially Jose, our server was friendly, jabs here and there (perfect in sparring with these group of girls).  However as the night wore on...the attentiveness wore off.
He forgot my corn.  Come to find out, he served it to another friend at the other side of the table.  Not such a big deal.
- Then came dessert.  I asked for a cup of coffee with a plate of Churros for the table.  The churros came, we ate it, it was okay, we sat there -- no coffee.
- Meanwhile, a table he was familiar with sat down next to us and he proceeds to yak them up, even pulling out his phone for a slide show and having a complate conversation with the table.
- When he finally got back to our table 20 minutes later, I looked at him and he realized he never brought my coffee and proceeded with the following:
 --   JOSE:   Oh! I am so sorry!  I won't charge you for it, it is removed it but let me give you a cup to go.
 --   ME:  Forget it..  Just take it off the bill
 --   JOSE:  Please. Let me buy you a cup of coffee.
 --   ME:  No, forget it.
 --   JOSE:  You sure?  Okay...well here's the bill, no rush
My friend took the bill and muttered to another friend "ooh...the coffee is still on here"

Now.  Let me set something straight.  It isn't the $2 he charged for my coffee.  Rather , why make the big gesture of falling on the sword with "I am SO SORRY! I TOOK IT OFF! LET ME BRING YOU A CUP TO GO!"   Had that been it, I would have been fine, but no....he lies about a $2 cup of coffee...
