Went here with a friend last year.  We were told there would be a wait for a table, despite the fact that a perfectly set table that was situated almost directly in front of us.  We waited for quite a while, browsing the art and looking around the pool, and were eventfully seated...at the EXACT same table we had been staring at earlier.  Are they trying to do the "fake wait" thing to seem more popular or raise their bar's business?  I find that very tacky.

Anyway, I had been craving chorizo, so I ordered the dos huevos (2 eggs and chorizo with corn tortillas).  It was okay.  Not mine blowing, and the portion was definitely really skimpy, especially for the price.  At least it was cooked well.

They did give my buddy a free dessert for his birthday, so that was nice.  The service was alright, but this place definitely had the feel of "you eat here because it's cool and thus you look cool" and not "you're here because the food/service is amazing."

I'd go back if a friend wanted to try it, but I won't venture here again on my volition.
