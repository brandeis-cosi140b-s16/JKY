Andrew C. and I tried this Nando's location in April after reading a lot of good reviews from our friends on Yelp. Why not, right? We live in Chandler and it's not like it's out of our way.

Well, sad to be writing this review because we were pretty stoked to try it.

Short Version:  

Not impressed! 

Longer Version (Los Detalles): 

We split the El Jefe Chicken Chimichanga. It was bland, overloaded with onions, and a few bites of chicken. Oh, about the chicken. It seemed like someone picked up a rotisserie chicken from Frys or Costco, shredded it up and threw it in the chimi. Laziness!  

The salsa wasn't anything to write home about; like a bland jar of Pace. The "extra hot" habanero sauce didn't pack much heat, either. 

If you enjoy quantity over quality, aka subpar Mexican food slathered in cheeses and sauces in ridiculously massive portions, then Nando's is your place. 

The service was great, nice atmosphere and patio - That's not good enough of a reason for me to come back. OK, maaaybe for drinks, but there's just so many better place in the Valley to get a Mexi-fix!
