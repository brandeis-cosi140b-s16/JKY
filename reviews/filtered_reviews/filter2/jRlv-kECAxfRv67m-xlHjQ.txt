It is different. I don't know if they changed owners or cooks but it's just not as good. Maybe an off night. Had the shredded beef enchiladas and they barely put any chile, the corn tortillas were either over cooked or not fresh but hard and not from frying. I removed the tortillas and scooped out the beef - it wasn't tender but stringy and hard. I poured salsa from the salsa bar on it. I'm so bummed I really, really liked this place. They are still really busy so maybe an off night.

I hate eating out and wasting money and calories on mediocre food.
