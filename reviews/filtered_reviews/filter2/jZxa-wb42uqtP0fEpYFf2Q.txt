I agree with Brandon L.  Costa vida, chipotle, and any other for that matter beats cafe rio hands down.  I have tried and tried to listen to my utah friends who rave about this place and have been there at least 3 times and have now decided that i will not go back anymore.  i think people are blinded by the hype of what people say and if you actually taste the food you know that it isn't good.  plus i hate ad ons.  enchilada style $1, sourcream $2, guacomole $2.  i am surprised they don't charge me for the beans, rice and tortilla.  i am already paying $8 bucks for the buritto, why do i have to pay for everything else that goes with it.  truth is it is a utah thing.  if your not from utah you won't like it. just like those not from from australia cant handle veggiemite.
