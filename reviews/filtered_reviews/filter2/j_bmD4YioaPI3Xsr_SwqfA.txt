Went for stuff sopapilla with a friend, very disappointed. I received  two (2) small pieces of bread with a tablespoon of shredded chicken laying in liquid (soggy).
My daughter's favorite food is Mexican, however she did not eat the stuff sopapilla.
The kicker is I paid $13.99 or $12.99. OVERPRICE.
Unfortunately I will not be recommending this location.
