This should only be a one-star shop, but for the fast and friendly greeters who sat us down right away. EVERYTHING after that went the opposite of good. The servings are mostly symbolic, we brought an appetite and left hungry. The battered cod tacos were tiny enough to be called taquitos with something resembling a fish stick in the center. I also had some unagi sushi and this unagi was poorly prepared. The waitress took the time to deride us at the end of our meal, mentioning that we should probably have ordered some sandwiches instead. The price tag was unreal, I felt ashamed for inviting a good friend along because he thought he's paying for the entire bill even though we went dutch. Pricey, tiny portions, lackluster service. Overall, I wish I never went there, period!
