The Guacamole was good.  The rest of the food was just "ok".  The place is also very loud. 

Took a while for all our entrees to come out.  Not all of our entrees came out at the same time, they came out one at a time, which is fine, but the server really should have informed us that the food items come out as they become ready before we ordered.

Dear Management please have your waitstaff inform guests that food items come out as they are ready.  I work at a place where the food comes out as it's ready.  Here's some verbiage your waitstaff can use: " all of our food is made fresh to order so as your dishes become ready we bring them out to the table hot and fresh."  This way your guests do not have the expectation that all of our entrees come out together.

That being said I realize this place is fairly new so I can forgive a lot of what went wrong last night. Perhaps in 3 months when they have ironed out all the kinks we shall return.
