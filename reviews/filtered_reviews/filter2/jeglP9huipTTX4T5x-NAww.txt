I used to go here regularly, but have been disappointed lately.  The last three times have been less than stellar.  I had cold food after a long wait one time. Another time I called to place an order for takeout, they answered hte phone and put me on hold for 10 minutes.  I finally hung up to try and call again and couldn't get anyone to answer the phone.  And this most recent time, my to-go order came with half of what I had ordered (and I only ordered one dish).  The item I ordered didn't come with the chicken nor the sauce, so rice, beans and some veggies for a meal wasn't so exciting.  Just disappointed since this was one of my favorites.
