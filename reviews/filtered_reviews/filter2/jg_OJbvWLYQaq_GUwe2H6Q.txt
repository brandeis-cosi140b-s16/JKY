**IMPROVEMENT NEEDED**
By curiosity as to what replaced The Fry Bread House, I stumbled across this place. I was very optimistic and excited to try. The restaurant is very hip and inviting and the owners are extremely nice people! I ordered the green chili pork burrito (in which I read came with rice, beans, cheese, and sour cream inside) so I'm thinking it's going to be "sort of" like Chipotles. We waited 20-25mins and nothing came out, while others got their food. I finally asked the owner if they forgot my order and he brought it out in less than 3 mins and apologized for forgetting. Yet no biggy for me since I'm a very understanding and patient person. However, the burrito was a decent size but the ratio of ingredients were WAY off, it should have been called a rice and bean burrito with green sauce because I couldn't find more than two small pieces of pork. So in other words, the green chili pork (which is the star of the show) was replaced by rice and beans. Now don't get me wrong, the food was tasty and fresh, and they did give complimentary chips and salsa which were delicious but they have a few things to improve on before I give this place a second chance.
