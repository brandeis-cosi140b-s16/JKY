Food always good ,that's  not the problem , the service is always so slow .we come in at least 1 a month it doesn't matter the time of day , mid day.  ,lunch , dinner ,all the same , today we even had to physically walk and ask our waiter for more chips , salsa , and drinks .and it wasn't even busy , he cashed out tables .. Lol.. Maybe just  laid back attitude , not sure 
After food was delivered by someone else after did  our waiter  only came back
When both our food was almost gone ,thankful we didn't have problems with it , 
The place is clean , walking in always a hi , get seated right away , big enough place that you don't have to wait long  but just the service 
We continue to come back only because of the good  good,hopefully someone reads these
