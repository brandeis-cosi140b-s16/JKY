Honestly this place is very average. Perusing the menu gives you the illusion that you're in for something special. Lots of different and innovative nacho options. At the end of the day though, what you get is way overpriced. Portions are average at best. A 10 dollar nacho plate here is easily finished whole 10 dollar nachos at Millers Alehouse are a monstrosity. On top of that, a cardinal sin. The cheese was cold. Really? After waiting 20 minutes for them to make nachos, something that should take 5 minutes max, for the cheese to be cold is pretty unforgiveable. On the plus side, their fried ice cream is great. Overall, Nacho Daddy thinks a little too highly if itself, charging way too much for barely average fare.
