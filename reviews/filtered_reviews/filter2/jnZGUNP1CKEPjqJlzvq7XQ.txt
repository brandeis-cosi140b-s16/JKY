We have been to the Tatum and Shea location many times and had high expectations. This place did not impress us. We had been on Mother's Day and the place was packed. The staff was friendly but the kitchen didn't seem to be able to cope with the crowd. It was an hour 'till we got our food and then it wasn't hot.
We thought we would give it another try so made a reservation for 6 pm. on Friday night. At 6:45 , after not a word from the hostess, we gave up and walked over to PCG and had a great evening. 
I don't think we'll be going back.
