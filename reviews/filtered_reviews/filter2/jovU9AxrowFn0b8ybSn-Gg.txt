I like to sample new restaurants in the area in which I live and so I ventured into Los Dos Molinos in the Ahwatukee Foothills village.   Three words:  One and Done.

The food is too salty and only mediocre.  The staff is unprofessional and sour at best-- apathetic at worst.  Does anyone care at this place?   Water cups went unfilled until we asked for a refill to save us from the overdose of sodium intake.  We had to beg for the server to give us a check.   Does anyone notice when a group is finished eating and is ready to go?  Pay attention staff!

The only positive thing about Los Dos Molinos is its location.   It's in the same shopping center as Safeway -- where you can quickly get over-the-counter remedies to cure some indigestion and plenty of rolls of toilet paper to supplement the meds.

Never again for me.
