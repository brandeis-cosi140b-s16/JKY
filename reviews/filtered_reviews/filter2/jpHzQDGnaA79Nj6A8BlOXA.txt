I've eaten here a few times now and the foods is good, but VERY spicy.  This time I decided it's too spicy to really enjoy.  Also, the service wasn't that great this time. We had a party of 6 and sat in the front bar area by the window. I had to ask for drinks, water and to place our order. finally another server came so the service improved 1/2 way through.  One of the couples had never been, she ordered the shrimp dish with rice and cheese. It's a $15 dollar dish and only got 4 shrimp.  And she didn't care much for it. 
But the highlight was a cockroach running around under our table.  I had to go get staff to take care of that.
I realize most restaurants have them, ya just don't see them. But that kinda ruined it for me along with the spiciness.
One more thing, the music was high energy like dance club and loud. And it was early, about 530 on a Saturday.
