Rubio's, you look pretty good now!  Consider this a strong...1.75 stars.  The service was very good.  

I had fish tacos.  When they arrived I thought it was fish sticks covered in a red sauce.  After I probed it with my fork I realized it was a rectangular portion from some kind of fish fillet.  Done medium well.  Something that should never be done with fish.  The pinto beans were average and the rice was below average with a few crunchy grains mixed in.  

The setting in the Miracle Mile shops is interesting.  Sit outside and people watch and have a couple drinks with your meal and you might enjoy yourself.
