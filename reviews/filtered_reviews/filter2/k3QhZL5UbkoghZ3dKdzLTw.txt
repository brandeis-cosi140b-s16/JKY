I ordered the breakfast bowl with Applewood bacon and queso. I asked for no salsa, which they accommodated me on that. However, their chilaquilas (an ingredient in my bowl) is really enchilada sauce. In what world are those two the same thing? Chilaquilas is eggs, nacho chip strips, ranchero sauce and cheese. Since they soaked all of the chips in this enchilada sauce, the whole thin tasted horrible. The bacon was in whole slices rather than broken up - doesn't make sense for eating a bowl. They used green olives which I've NEVER had on Mexican food. I hate green olives and would have asked which kind they were had I thought they might something other than the traditional black olives. My husband did not like his breakfast tacos either. The only reason they are getting two stars is we've had good quesadillas here before.
