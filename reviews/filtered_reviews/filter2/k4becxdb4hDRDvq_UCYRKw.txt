High price for mediocre dinner.  Steak had extremely salty marinade loaded with cumin.  My fault since I hate the cumin but the salt was unforgivable.  They were nice enough to take it back and cook it without any marinade and then it was good.  I used a travelzoo coupon.  This was a ripoff.  They said $120 food value for half price.  However, you are not allowed to certain dishes even if the total bill would be less than the $120.  You can order those dishes with extra charge.  There is a mandatory $20 tip added, too.  They won't have a chance to stick it to me again...Travelzoo or Border Grill.
