If you're feeling like "Mexican" this place is just ok. Yes just ok. Their homemade taco chips are definitely a winner and hard to put down. Salsa "tasty". 

I like the 2 or 3 combo option on the menu. Lots of items to choose from. I tried the shredded chicken and beef tacos (served with rice and refried beans). Shells were homemade but a little greasy. My husband went with the shrimp enchiladas ($13.99). Nothing special and expensive. 

The have a long list of margaritas including their "Kick-Ass Tex-Ass" topped with a shot of beer. During happy hour (3 to 6:30) most margaritas are $5.99. Although that may seem like a good deal don't be fooled because the glass is filled to the brim with ice. 

Overall kind of pricey for a Mexican restaurant and not all that impressed with the quality of the food. Let's take it up a notch here.
