If you're looking for a New Mexico experience, you're not going to find it at Si Señor. 

This place has been on my bookmarks for over a year now, ever since some Greyhead sent Andrew C. and I hate messages dropping the name of this place for our Carlsbad Tavern reviews. 

Will NEVER understand why people feel the need to do that  . . . 

We stopped in on a Friday night for dinner. 

Seated immediately, and our server was polite and attentive. 

No booze; just two iced teas. 

The chips and salsa came with four types of dips: Bean, Green, Red and some kind of Sour Cream and Green Chile combo (delicious).

Your first bowl of chips is complimentary; additional bowls are $3. 

We ordered: 

#2: Chile Relleno Plate with Both Red and Green Sauce
#14: Beef Chimichanga with Red Sauce 

The Rellenos were soggy, and very little spice.

The Beef Chimichanga was also soggy with unseasoned beef.


Monica O. said the beans tasted like Rosarita; I think Rosarita tastes better than the beans on these plates.

The best part of the meal were the Sopas, but those are pretty tough to mess up to begin with. 

What a bust, skip it. 

Nunca más, Si Señor!
