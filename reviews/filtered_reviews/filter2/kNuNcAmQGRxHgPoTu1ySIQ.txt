There are some tasty things on the menu, but they're spoiled by the prices. I understand a restaurant has to make a certain amount of money for each plate, but this place was exceptionally over priced.

Tacos were good, pork buns were tasty, and the chips and salsa were ok.

Unless you're bent on going here, try another place. Quality to price ratio is out of wack.
