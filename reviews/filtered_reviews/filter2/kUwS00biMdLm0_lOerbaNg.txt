I decided to use the walk up window instead of the busy drive thru. I waited 5 minutes before being served. The girl who ran the window was greetful. My name was called to pick up the food and I had to wait behind a customer who was ordering so my food sat there for a while before I helped. I chose the veggie & chicken tacos which were soggy,bland and with a boring unvariety vegetables.
