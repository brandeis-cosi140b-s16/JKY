Food and drinks mediocre, service terrible. Once I asked the bar tender if they had cider, he said no, my friend points to the drafts and there was one on tap. I went with a group of friends and we sat in a round booth, the server was more interested in showing us her cleavage instead of good service. The cocktails here are too sweet. Their signature margarita is made from a mix, not from scratch, and it costs something like 12 bucks. Go to Mad Mex.
