Meh, meh and meh... I really had hope for this place but it started evaporating as soon as I saw signs on their door: "18+ only" and "No weapons allowed". Was that a joke or they really are having issue with minors shooting guns there?

After looking at the menu that was listing Russian, American,Mediterranean and... Mexican food I had a feeling that they are really struggling with their culinary "identity". Russian food choices were pretty standard (borsch, pelmeni and vareniki) but after some hesitation I've ended up ordering chicken lula kebab. Unfortunately that was an utter greasy disappointment that I could barely eat. Everyone seems to be raving about their potatoes which I found to be absolutely nothing special too. 

Decor looks like the place came out of 90s time machine. 

I really think most of the 5* reviews are either fake or produced by employees and their relatives. 

I still think that the place has a potential and if they want to attract more (American) customers (read - not just sketchy looking middle eastern men smoking hookah) they can easily do it by:
* simplifying the menu to just have Russian and Mediterranean food.
* change the decor... it's just a complete disaster right now
If that doesn't happen this Dacha will end up bankrupt before we know it... you can sustain business on just vodka drinking parties. It was a lunch time on the weekend and we were almost the only customers.

Otherwise if you want to have a decent kabob head out to Kabob House for now (heck... at least they don't charge any extra for the salad and their meat is done right)

Verdict: Not coming back unless I get paid to eat there.

PS. Kids are not welcome there either. They didn't even have a high chair available :/
