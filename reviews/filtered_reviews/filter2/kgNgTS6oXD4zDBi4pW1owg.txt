Only Mexican restaurant without complimentary chips and salsa.  Ask for diet coke or pepsi.  We got the can and a straw. No glass.  Obviously no refil.  $3.00 per can.  Are you kidding me?  I ordered enchilada Reyna.  Dinner menu states it is served with rice or beans and 2 sides.  However, when I ordered 2 sides I was told the rice or beans that came with it WAS a side.  Rice came in tiny cup.  It was cold.  Retried beans also in tiny cup so runny I  had to eat with spoon.  The rest no better or worse than typical Mexican restaurant. I can see why basically empty on Friday night.
