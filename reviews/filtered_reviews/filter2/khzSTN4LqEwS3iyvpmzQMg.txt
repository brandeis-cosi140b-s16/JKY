It was our first time here, since this location just opened. We loved the carnitas. The Wahoo salad with carnitas and and the carnitas taco were both really good. We went primarily for the fish tacos, and they were just ok. The two biggest issues that we had that warranted only two stars is first, they charge for their salsa! What? You have to tell them what salsas you want when ordering and they charge for them!  Really?! How do you serve Mexican food and CHARGE for salsa!?!? That seemed Crazy to us! The second issue was minor but annoying, we ordered a kids meal and the cup they gave us for the kids meal didn't have a lid to fit it! The adult cups had lids! Needless to say, we had a couple spills...and you have to ask for napkins, ugh!
