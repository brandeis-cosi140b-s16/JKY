Oh, America, what have you done?  I've been eating at this restaurant since you opened at this location.  Back then your food was delicious.  The carne was muy bueno, and the elote was fantastico.  I hadn't visited in a while, but upon my return found the food bearing only a vauge resemblance to it's past wonderfullness.  Maybe now that you have several locations your available attention is diminished.  I won't be back America, there are too many good Mexican places close by to eat at your place anymore.  Adios.
