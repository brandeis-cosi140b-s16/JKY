I really have tried to give this restaurant a shot.  I've been 4 or 5 times now, and other than the friendly staff, I just don't have anything positive to share about it.  

The food is always glistening with oil/grease!  Everything from the rice to the corn tortillas is shiny. 

Today, I just wanted some fish taco's a-la Rubios or Baja Fresh and instead spent $13 for uber greasy (hey- a little grease now and then is just fine, but this is beyond gross) tacos.  They tasted okay, but I couldn't help but wonder if Crisco is their main friend???  Ewwwww.  

Sorry, I don't have a better review, but I gave them 4 or 5 tries to make something that wasn't dripping in gooey lard!  

Better luck to you.  

Warmly,

Kirin :)
