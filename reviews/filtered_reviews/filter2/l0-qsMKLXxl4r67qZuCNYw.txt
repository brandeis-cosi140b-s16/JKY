Went to this place last night with a party of 7. Told the waitress at the very beginning that we would need separate checks. Food very average I thought. Service was not good at all. One person had to send his carnitas tacos back two times and decided he had lost his appetite. After asking for our check so we could leave, it took 45 minutes to get our checks which two were not correct. When we received our checks, they had the nerve to automatically add 20% tip. This waitress did NOT deserve a 20% tip. I have never seen anything more than 18% added and I think that is very high as well. It is not required by law to leave any certain amount of a tip so how is it that they can get away with adding an automatic 20%. Very disappointing and I will never go back. Food = not good. Service = terrible. Automatic 20% to someone who didn't deserve it = BULLSHIT!
