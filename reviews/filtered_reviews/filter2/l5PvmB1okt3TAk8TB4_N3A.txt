This place was my favorite for many years. There have been changes recently for the worse. They no longer offer the appetizer sampler which was always a favorite among my friends, family & clients.  The homemade chips have been replaced with stale hard chips and 3 different salsa sides have been reduced to just one.  Some of the decor has changed. They have removed some of the overhead lighting with corny track lighting along the wall. The prices have also increased yet portions are much smaller. Margarita glasses are now served in a water glass rather than usual margarita glass.  I'm hoping things will return to how they used to be...Stat!
