Well I had never had tex-mex before and I was very curious!  This is my first experience eating brisket (I was told this is the best thing to order at a tex-mex place) and it was delicious!  ....And there is a but....So I am a Northerner and I probably have this wrong so please forgive me....but am I allowed to compare brisket to bbq in the sense that good bbq usually does not have a lot of fat or grisel or bones?  Is brisket supposed to have clumps of fat in it?  If so - and if I am clueless, please forgive the reference to it and skip my review, but if you are the tiniest grossed out by big pieces of fat, dont get the brisket here.  Ok fat conversation over.  Other than that the brisket that I got in my tacos was very tender and delicious.  Yet I was kind of wondering 'where is the rest?'  I gave this place only two stars because the hard-shelled tacos I got had probably three good mouthfuls of brisket and no lettuce or other fillings in them so they pretty much came out 1/3 full for over ten bucks?  (I ordered two tacos but I think you can order 1 or 2 or 3).  No amount of dry Spanish rice on the plate could make up for it.  The meal also came with your choice of beans which were very good.  The pic posted shows the truth of portion size so judge for yourself.  

Service was excellent and they were constantly adding chips to the basket on the table.  Sigh...in the end I couldnt get over the fat I had to pick through or that it cost so much for so little.  I hope to try this place in a few weeks and add more stars.
