After seeing "Vegas the Show" we were famished and needed a bite to eat before hitting a club.  We stopped at Cabo Wabo Cantina for an appetizer sampler.  To call the food mediocre would be generous.  The chips came from a bag.  There was fat in the meat on the nachos and everything was greasy.  It was loud as a club in the empty restaurant for no reason at all.

On the plus side: our waitress was friendly.

Also, there is a "franchise fee" tacked onto each bill.  They do not tell you this ahead of time.  I have never seen this done anywhere else.  It is a percentage of your bill, so BEWARE!
