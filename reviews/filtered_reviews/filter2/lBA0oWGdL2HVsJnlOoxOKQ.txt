The chips and salsa were really good, but it kinda went downhill from there. I was with my wife and my 4 year old daughter and we didn't order drinks-it bugs the hell out of when the server doesn't even bother to hide their disappointment when you aren't drinking. 

I am a mole fanatic and this had one of the weirdest tasting moles I have ever had. It manged to be bitter and yet tasteless at the same time. I don't know how you pull that off, but it sure did. The chicken in the dish was also bland and dried up-like they stewed it all day without any seasoning.

 We are new to Vegas and I don't know how on God's Green Earth this won "Best" of anything. It seems like to LV-RJ just rotates that award around to whatever place hasn't had it for awhile. See for yourself: http://bestoflasvegas.com/2010/eat-drink/best-mexican-restaurant/#ifh=842

There were two bright points to the meal. 
1. It was so slow that night that we had the waiter all to ourselves so he could mope about us not ordering any alcohol and bring us our food quickly
2. They did bring us a tasty little dessert at the end which along with the quality chips and salsa earned it a 2 star review from me.
