Sorry.  I'm from Southern California so I'm used to great Mexican food.  We were excited to try this restaurant, since we had read some great things about it.  However, the waiter was pompous and the food was mediocre.  We were in a party of four and we all ordered different meals.  The guacamole that was made from one avocado was $11.  The restaurant is in a scary location.  We had to park in a back alley.  It was agreed that the experience was a bust.  If you're in the area and want great food, go to Lon's at the Hermosa, Elements at Sanctuary or True Food Kitchen.
