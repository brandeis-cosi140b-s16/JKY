Back to my Vegas trip...

We came here after walking around on the strip and aside from the place being super dark I was kind of excited to see what they had to offer.  First we must have came in the back way because I couldn't find the hostess or a server walking about.  Finally tracked one down and after some finagling we got seated upstairs.  The upstairs was nice but we didn't get a good seat to view the strip so we got tucked away in a corner which probably lead us to being ignored for a good 30 mins before we even got our drinks let alone placed our order.  I should have taken the cue to leave then.  We placed our orders and the waiter disappeared for another hour and finally brought back our food.  Seemed he was preoccupied with the lovely ladies in the other part of the restaurant.  I don't blame him, but at least check back once in a while.  We ate and left, the place was decorated well but the food was pretty mediocre.  Disappointing.
