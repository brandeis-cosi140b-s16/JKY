I have never been to any other America's Taco Shop before so I can't speak for other locations but I can tell you that I will not come here again.  I came for lunch here with a couple buddies and were completely unsatisfied with the food portions we ordered.   To be honest the food wasn't the greatest either. For the prices they charge I expected a lot more.  What's up with the flat burrito? Sad to say but we left there almost as hungry as when we arrived.
