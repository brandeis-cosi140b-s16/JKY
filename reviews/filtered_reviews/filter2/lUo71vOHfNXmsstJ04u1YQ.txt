This is a difficult review to write because I love on the border just not in Las Vegas. 

I have been to this location a couple of times since we moved here and it's just terrible service, lukewarm food and bland at that. I have high expectations from the old on the border in Texas that I used to go to all the time and love.

Our waitress today I swear didn't hear anything that we said. Part of my order I wanted to go they brought it to the table, we requested salsa never got it, the fajitas weren't even steaming or sizzling when they got to the table. I had to have them redo it and there was no apology.

The chips, queso and salsa we're good,  but then again how can you screw that up?

We had to ask for drink refills and for extra napkins twice.

It has been a while since I've been there...they have new updated menus and several different cheese bowl options. 

Not sure I will return to On the Border except for chips to go.
