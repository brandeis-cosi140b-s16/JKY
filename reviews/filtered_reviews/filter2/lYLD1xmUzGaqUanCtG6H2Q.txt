Great UYE here last week.  Friendly staff, but missed some very important details when describing the appetizers to our large group.  We were brought 4 platters at $24.95 each.

----NO BOOZE!!!    ----NO BYOB!!! 

So the "value" part of this restaurant totally sucks.   My combination of the pork something and the mole, which were good but not great, were incredibly small portions for $17.95.  I seriously did not have enough meat in the mole sauce for a single taco. Weak. Beans were average. Rice was tasty, but like another reviewer said I think they used frozen vegetables.

I think the Guacamole was $10.95!

It's kinda a nice place, but the prices are easily 2 to 3 time higher than what they should be.   I'll go to Barrio Cafe and not this place from now on.
