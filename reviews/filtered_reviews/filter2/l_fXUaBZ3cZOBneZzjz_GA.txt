Listen, this place has mediocre burritos and "okay" mexican food.

How did this place get such a high rating and how has it been voted as "best Mexican in Charlotte"...I SURE DON'T KNOW.  

Honestly great food.  But I don't feel it qualifies for authentic Mexican in the least.  Mexican food is one of my few passions and I can whip up a better burrito than PHAT Burrito in about 5 minutes in my own kitchen.  Some spices would have been nice.  The salsa that they have is very good and if you asked them to put it inside the burrito you might have a pretty close match to something halfway tasty.  

But quite honestly, it tasted like something from a college campus.  Yuck.
