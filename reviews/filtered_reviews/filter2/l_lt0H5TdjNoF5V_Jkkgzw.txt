You are paying for the view and atmosphere.  Food is way overpriced and forgettable.    This was our second visit to this restaurant,  (the first time, at dessert, my child got fried ice cream and we didn't know there was peanuts in it.  My child is highly allergic, we had to leave in a hurry) I called the restaurant in hopes of speaking to a manager they might want to put ingredients on their dessert menu (or even a simple disclaimer "contains nuts" would do.), never got a call back.
This time I got mixed fajitas, it was more like a lunch portion, cost me nearly 20.00! Kids meals are nearly 7.00.  Lindo Michoacan... probably wouldn't hurt my feelings if I never go back.
