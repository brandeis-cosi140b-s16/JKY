Well, I must not get it!  With all the raving I must have had high expectations?  The owner was friendly, but asked and reasked my order several times. I was one of the first and only customers in there. So I ordered the bean tostada and green chili beef chimichanga:
The toastada was super crispy (impressive for take out) but didn't realize tomatoes are extra:/ The "salsa" sauce was good, it tasted fresh and had heat but wasn't super hot.  However the beans were like soup...dripping off the tostada and pur√©ed to have no bean texture!? Personal preference?
  The green chili chimi was huge and with the bean(soup) & rice in the container it was super full. The rice was good and the spice of the green chili sauce was spicy and delicious, however the chimi wasn't fried?!  Or at least it wasn't fried well...it was pale and pasty without the crunchy bits that make a chimi awesome. I was particularly disappointed as the chimi is more expensive. Also if it is a beef chimi, I expect beef of which there was barely any...pics show what was inside...
Not a good first impression. I spent over $24 and won't even eat it. 
Bummer.
