I hardly ever take the time to write out a review, but this experience could not go ignored. I would  have much rather spent my hard earned money elsewhere. 

The glass that separates you and the ordering counter must make it hard for them to hear, I had to repeat myself constantly. It would've been helpful to have been told that from the get go instead of figuring it out at the end. 

I asked for a sample of the chicken because I've never been and was having a hard time ordering, the guy looked at me like I was stupid for asking. I pointed at little plastic containers they had by the meat and said that they must obviously give samples. He finally let me try a bit.  It was a big ordeal to find out how long of a wait it was for the green chile pork to come out. I had to ask him like 4  different times if he would just make one with the little bit that was left. He acted annoyed for having to scoop out the meat that was left because it required a bit more effort. 

The lady at the checkout was rude when I asked if I could pay while I waited for it to finish cooking.  She ignored us until I asked for drink cups. All in all, the food was ok (the tortilla soup was a massive disappointment, they don't even put tortilla in it. Don't order it if you are a fan of tortilla soup, the flavor was off), the service sucks and the line is a cluster f***k. At least chipotle has an efficient and friendly assembly line. I will not be returning. Much better places to support in the area.
