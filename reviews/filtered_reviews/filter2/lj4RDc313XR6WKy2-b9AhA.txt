When I go into a Mexican restaurant, I first look to see if they have good combination platters for lunch and dinner.  I have to say, my first impression was not that good.  I thought their menu wasn't the greatest.

I believe I had the chimichanga and that I had a stomach ache afterwards.  My waiter was fine but I witnessed the manager having some sort of negative exchange with him.  I hate that. I do not want to hear somebody yelling or openly criticizing someone else when I am trying to enjoy my meal.  Its a real turn off.
