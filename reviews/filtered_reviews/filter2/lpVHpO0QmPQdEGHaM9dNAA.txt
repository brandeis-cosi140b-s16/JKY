I walk past this place every day on my way to class and finally managed to stop in and try it out. The inside of the place is tiny. Fortunately they have a lot of outside seating for everyone. I wasn't quite sure what I wanted, so I grabbed one of the menus to take a look. To be honest, I expected there to be more on the menu. Based on the menu, you can get a Taco, Burrito, Torta, Quesadilla, or Vampiro. That sounds like a decent number of choices, because in most places you get the choice of Chicken, Pork a few different ways, beef (shredded, ground, or carne asada), fish, etc. Here, the only choices listed were Carne Asada and Pastor (a marinated pork). I thought the Pastor sounded good, but was disappointed that those are the only choices.

The other thing that struck me is that the descriptions on the menu are not that accurate. The quesadilla and the vampiro have the SAME description, except that one lists flour tortilla and one lists corn tortilla. So, I ordered the vampiro because of the corn tortilla and because the price was a dollar less. When I got it, i found out that it is not at all like a quesadilla, and is in fact a lot like a tostada, not something that I had hoped for. It was open face and the tortilla was fried crisp. Also, IT WAS TINY. The vampiro was almost $4.00, it was much smaller than a standard tostada, and it wasn't loaded with the meat and toppings. The food didn't taste bad, but I wasn't thrilled with it, either.

All-in-all, I'm not sure ill be back. For that price and size, the food should be better. If the size goes up, price goes down, or the taste improves, then I'll probably come back. Until then, though, my go-to mexican place is Carolina's.
