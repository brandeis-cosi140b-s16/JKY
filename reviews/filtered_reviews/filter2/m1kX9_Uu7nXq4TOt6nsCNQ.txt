Dining Guadalajara was more like eating in Guadalajara, complete with a wait for a table despite having many opens ones and a questionable security guard at the front door.

We were in a cave like room waiting for our table, luckily it was just a 5 minute wait for lunch.

One inside the main dining hall we were able to see the large size of this place, tables finished wall decorates but a unfinished ceilings and no windows make up the inside.

I oped for the chillies relleno off the lunch special menu $7.50  most of the lunch specials range from 7.25 to 8.50.

From seating to our main course we had over 5 different people visit our table.

The chips were nothing special bu I do like the the spicy and thin salsa here.

My chillie rellno was a bit different, the sauce was a bland tomato based sauce, the chillie it self could have used a bit more roasting and the cheese seemed a bit thin.

Overall the prices seemed high for the location, and quality of food, I would sooner go to la canasa.
