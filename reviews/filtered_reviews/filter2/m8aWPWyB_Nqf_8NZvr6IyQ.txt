I've eaten there 3 times now.  Every time is just OK. I went after New Yeas for hangover food and my meal was really tiny. They have a brunch with like 5 to 10 items on it & I thought 'is that all I get'?  During this visit, we sat up at the bar, there was like 6 people in the restaurant, and the bartender looked as if we were boring her to death. And the service was pretty lousy in general.

We went today. Ordered a fajita. it was just OK as well. Chicken was over seasoned and by the time it came out to me there was no more sizzle to the fajita. It was hot, but it definitely was not sizzling or smoking with wholesome goodness as one would expect. I didn't finish most of it.  Co-worker got the fried shrimp tacos, he picked the shrimp out of the 2nd one, didn't finish most of it.   Other co-worker got a salad, she picked the salad part off the top of the tostada, didn't finish most of it.   Chips need more salt and the salsa is lackluster.

If you're staying at the hotel and it's there, go ahead and try it, but I wouldn't drive to this hotel to eat here.

Also, thought was a little expensive.  My ice tea was $3 and by the end of the meal lunch had cost me $29...meh
