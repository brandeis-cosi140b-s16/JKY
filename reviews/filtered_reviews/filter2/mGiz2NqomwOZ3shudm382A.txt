The chips were okay, queso was not tasty definitely one of the worse. I ordered the carne asada tacos...definitely over cooked, the rice seems like it came out of a rice-a-roni box if I am being truthful. It definitely had a chain feel and not a good chain. The atmosphere was okay except sitting outside and a breeze hits...reminds me of the hot stagnant smells of New Orleans streets the morning after a mardi gras parade (warm regurgitated alcohol and urine)....take caution in dining and don't expect great food and you won't be disappointed....ps the service was great, very attentive waitress...
