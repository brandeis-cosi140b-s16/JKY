This was my 1st time trying this place out. I'm born and raised in Mexico and was excited to see some of the menu items like Pozole, Menudo or Chiles Rellenos. Since Pozole can be made in so many ways I told the lady at the front desk that it was my 1st time there (she didn't even say welcome or glad you are here) and wanted to try the Pozole before ordering it, if she was able to give me a sample of it in a small cup (the ones they use for the salsas to go)  she said NO, we can't do that. It started off bad, so I decided not to order that and went for the "safe side" 5 different tacos (Carne Asada, Chicken, Pastor, Shrimp and Tongue) the only one that was pretty good was the Tongue one (it had the traditional flavor). Salsas are less than o.k. Carne Asada was dry, Shrimp didn't have ANY flavor at all. It didn't come with limes my plate so I needed to ask for that. They need to step up their Customer Service and maybe their flavor profiles. Not coming back, if the tacos weren't good probably pozole wasn't either BUT can't say since they couldn't even give me a sip of it :( sad so sad...
