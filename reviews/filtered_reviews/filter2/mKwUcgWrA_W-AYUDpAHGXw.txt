Save time and your money and don't eat here. As many other reviews state, the atmosphere and decor is very good. They definitely hit the mark there but that is where it ends.

We came on a Sunday around 1:00. They had a brunch menu in addition to a dinner menu. Huge selection of entrees on the dinner menu, all ranging from 17.95 and up. The four adults in our party all agreed that there wasn't anything special about the food. I had a chimichunga and the chicken was super dry and the shell was over fried. Rice, no Bueno. The menu also stars at the bottom 10.95 minimum per person. Seriously!  Not sure if they would have enforced it. 

They brought some of our drinks in plastic cups. For $18/person you ought to be able to put the drink in a glass. 

Kids meals were $10 each as well. Fine if you don't want to cater to kids but seriously. My son had a pizza and before you say it... yes, don't order pizza at a Mexican restaurant.

It's all about the taste and quality of the food. I will pay $30 for a $30 steak. I will pay more if I am in a casino or high tourist area. I expect quality if I am going to pay this much and this place failed miserably.
