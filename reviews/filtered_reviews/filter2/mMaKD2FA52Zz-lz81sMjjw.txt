Not a fan!  I had Fajitas which had very little flavor and the tortilla chips were covered in salt.  The more outrageous part was this meal cost more than $20.  Mexican food should not cost that much, especially in Charlotte, NC.  The servers were definitely friendly, but I'm not rating the service here.  The food itself just wasn't that great.  Maybe it was an off night.  Sorry.
