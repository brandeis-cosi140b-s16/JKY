The service was great, but the food looked much better than it tasted. If you like spicy or traditional Mexican food, avoid this place. Their salsas and enchilada sauces are sweet and have very little to no spice at all. The crazy thing is that this place seems to have a healthy stream of customers each night. It's hard to find good authentic Mexican food in the east valley. We would have rather had Serrano's or Nando's, which isn't saying much.
