It's disappointing to have to write this review, as Macayo's used to be my favorite place to go for a Mexican food craving. We went 2 weekends ago. It was busy and we sat for about 10 minutes before anyone acknowledged we were there to take our drink order. We finally got our food and it's not the same quality I remember. The rice tasted like it was from a box. It was gross. My kids had the make your own taco platter and the ground beef was cold and bland. I wish we had just gone to Federicos. Spent $80 on food we didn't even enjoy.
