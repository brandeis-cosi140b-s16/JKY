Stumbled on this place and figured I'd give it a try .. Didn't feel like dealing with the restaurants closer to ASU . Place smelled dirty right when you came in .. Poor greeting and the place was empty. Came in around 645. Ordered a fajita and an enchilada. The fajitas were ok , they didn't provide any lettuce or cheese, or tomato. The guac was less than desirable and looked like it came out of a bag and the sour cream didn't seem fresh . The fajitas didn't have any sizzle to it upon arriving at the table. The enchilada was ok .. Nothing fancy . The server didn't seem like he even wanted to be there .. This place needs a huge makeover! Better lighting , refresh the menu and update the decor . I found this place on yelp!
