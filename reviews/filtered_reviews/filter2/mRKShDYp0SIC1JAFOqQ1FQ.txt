Not impressed. To start, the chips were cold, thick, and tasteless, but they are complimentary so it is what it is.

Their margarita menu has some delicious sounding concoctions, but be ready to pay for it. I tried the Queens cooler at the suggestion of our sever. It was really, really bad.  It reminded me of Malibu rum mixed with the cheapest tequila you can find.  It is expensive considering how weak it is (go get your buzz somewhere else...)

They have an extensive taco menu. Between my husband and myself, we tried about 8 different tacos and honestly we wouldn't come back for them... soggy and boring. 

I brought home a chicken quesadilla for my mother and honestly it was delicious! Yes, that's right - the chicken quesadilla (boring old chicken and cheese) was the best thing we tried all night.  

I will say that the hostess was friendly and our server was up eat, nice, and attentive.  The bus boys did a good job keeping our table clear too.
