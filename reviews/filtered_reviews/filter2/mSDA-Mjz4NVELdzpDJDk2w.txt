Third time I have been in the past month, sad to say it will be my last. Poor service, long wait, dirty tables. When we finished our food we had to wait for over 20 min for someone to come back over. The waitress stated that she could not run our card due to her family being in town??? Yup, that's what she said! Another girl came ran our card and gave me a box to box my own food. Now the server that stated she could not run my card was able to come over to grab the tip though. Great food! It's just a shame that the service is going down.

A manager by the name of Brad has since contacted me. He stated that he working on correcting the issue. I appreciate the fast response, maybe give them another try next month?
