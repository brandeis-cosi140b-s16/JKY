The food was amazing, but their extremely pretty female manager was a complete psycho! She was so rude to her staff RIGHT in front of us. The servers looked terrified of her and were so submissive around her. She literally barked orders at one of the waitresses right in front of me. When our server came back to give us the check, I told her her manager seemed like a REAL gem. She let the tiniest smile out and literally looked terrified to react. This manager needs to be fired and doesn't deserve to manage at all. You can't treat staff that way and expect to have a successful restaurant. I hope she is fired by now because I feel bad for anyone who has to work around her.
