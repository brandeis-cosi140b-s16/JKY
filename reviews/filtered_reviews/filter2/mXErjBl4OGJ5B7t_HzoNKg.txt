SumoMaya has such a cool atmosphere that I was ready to love it, but service and food fell so short of mediocre. I definitely would not come back here for a meal but probably enjoying some cocktails would be fine.

The service issues started when I first arrived, 15 minutes early for a noon reservation. The restaurant was pretty empty, but there were a lot of servers, and I requested a table on the patio which has all of 4 other people. I waited for everyone else to arrive and then at noon we asked to be seated. The hostess said she just seated someone out there (nope, still 4 people) so she had to wait a little before seating us. 10 minutes later we asked to be seated again and she said if we sat inside then she could seat us immediately, so we agreed to just sitting inside. We each ordered an entree but everything came out separately. And by separately I mean 5-6 minutes apart. I get bringing food out when it's ready if people are sharing dishes, but each person ordered their own meal (salad...not shareable food) and I go out to eat so I can eat with other people. If I wanted to eat my meal by myself, I would stay home. 

Then the food just wasn't very good. I got the vegetarian chopped salad (one of the very few vegetarian options available) and I just did not like it - the greens were a little too hard, the mushrooms has a bad rubbery texture, and the smoke flavor was just awful.
