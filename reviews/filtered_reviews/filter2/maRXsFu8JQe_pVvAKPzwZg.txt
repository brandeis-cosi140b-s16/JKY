We went here late one night for dinner because it was the only Mexican place open past 10PM. The bar was the only place available to sit down so we ordered drinks and got chips and salsa. I ordered the albondigas soup and a bean burro. The soup was extremely salty, too salty to the point where I told our waiter I wasn't able to eat it. The burro was OK, I only ordered it because it was on the a la carte menu and cheap. I will say the service was pretty fast and attentive but it still isn't saving it for me to return anytime soon.
