I went on Thursday because I was so excited for the daily special, which was tamales. I was so disappointed when they told me they were completely out. How do you not prepare enough for your SPECIAL & run out? I came three hours before it closed too, so it's not like I was being an unreasonable customer last minute. I was disappointed as that was literally the only reason I went there. The staff didn't care, at all. I brought it to their attention. Out of frustration after buying something else that was overpriced that I didn't want to eat (I brought someone with me so
I couldn't just leave), I ended up talking to a manager. Won't be returning to this location!
