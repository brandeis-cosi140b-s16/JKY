Had a deal chicken for this place and heard it was fabulous so I spent $49 on a deal chicken...I was really very very very disappointed with this place.

The service was awful, which should have been my first sign.  The food, especially one that is promoting a "tortilla factory" was bland and really nothing special.  

The chips were cold, the chorizo queso was coagulated and our meal wasn't anything you couldn't get at a mexican restaurant for half the price and double the flavor. 

The margaritas were watered down.  

The best part, dessert.  The chocolate cake and the cheesecake are both pretty damn good, hence the 2 star.

Oh, and parking sucks too.
