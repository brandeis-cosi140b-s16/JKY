If I was in search of Mexican food, this would not be where I would go.  You are eating Mexican food in the middle of a casino next to the Carrot Top Theater- You just can't expect anything authentic.  

We only ended up at this restaurant as a stop between the Carrot Top show and the club downstairs.  It was about 11pm and we just needed food and didn't really care about quality.  

The prices are to be expected- a little higher than you would like.  We had a quesadilla and tacos, which are probably about the same quality as what you get at a Don Pablo's.  What I missed was free chips and salsa!  This is Mexican- they should come standard!

Also, our service totally stank!  We say at the bar so we could watch the TVs.  It wasn't very busy (being that it was 11pm).  The bartender only came over to us to take our order and then we had to flag her down to get our check.  She didn't check on us once throughout the meal.  

So, if you like Americanized Mexican, go for it.  Hope you have a better waitress than us.
