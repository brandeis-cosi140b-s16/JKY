Blonde girl working the front has little to no social or customer service skills. I order my burrito then try to order a water cup and got cut off about 3 times. It was 8:30 so I guess she really wanted to get home to watch game of thrones. Then she proceeded to ask me 3 additional times if my name was really Morgan. I'm a guy by the way so I'm guessing this was blowing her mind harder than my water cup order. Foods delicious, I just think they could walk left or right for a couple minutes and find a more competent cashier. I'll stick to Los Favoritos and Tacos N More from now on.
