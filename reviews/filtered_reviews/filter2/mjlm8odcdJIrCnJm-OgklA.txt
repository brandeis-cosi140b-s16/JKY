Here in San Francisco we have a place called Tres Agaves (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tres-agaves-san-francisco#hrid:YpvCLegLph2ny8uY24tH-Q), and it's pretty good.  One would think that Cien Agaves would be 33 1/3 times better, but sadly, it was not the case.

Walking down First Avenue, we saw Cien Agaves and decided to try it.  We asked for a table on the patio, and they gladly accommodated our request.  We were lucky to get a table on the actual patio, not in the driveway next to it.  The driveway was home to 6-8 tables and a few heating lamps.  We sat down and enjoyed the potpourri of smell sensations: fresh spring Arizona air, grilled onions and second-hand smoke.  The couple next to us sure did enjoy those Marlboro lights.

Our server was quick, efficient and friendly.  She managed to keep up with our indecisive party of six, while refilling our drinks, waters and chips and salsa.

The food here, however, just wasn't very good.  I ordered a steak fajita, which may have been a mistake.  The giant skillet had a lot of onions and bell peppers on it, but not too much in the steak department.  It may have been a blessing in disguise, because the few morsels of steak I did find were not particularly tasty.  They were overcooked, rough and flavorless.  

I did like the atmosphere and the service here, but the food wasn't even of Chevy's quality.  It's definitely more of a place to get a drink with your friends and maybe have a taco or two (or ten - the whole taco combination platter).  

2.5 stars.
