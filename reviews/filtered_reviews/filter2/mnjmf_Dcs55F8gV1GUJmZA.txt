We saw this place on Check Please! After eating here, "check please" was exactly what we wanted. The best part of the meal was the chips & salsa. We loved it & couldn't stop eating it. Very good & very flavorful. We started with margaritas. They turned out to be $8 worth of flavored ice water. I ordered the Especialidad de la Casa. The beef tasted bland & old BUT was tender. The shrimp was big & cooked properly. The chicken was dry, overcooked & the seasoning sat on top vs marinated as advertised. My wife ordered the steak & chicken fajitas. The steak again was old & flavorless. The seasoning sat on top of the chicken & was dry. All the meat tasted bland & stewed. Disappointed can't begin to describe how we felt. We drove all the way out there from Chandler. We passed much better restaurants to get to this one.
