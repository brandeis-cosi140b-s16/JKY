I wanted to like this place...really, I did!  After reading reviews and looking at pictures, I had to try it.  The chips and salsa--very good!  The carne asada--not good.  At all.  It was very salty and kind of gross.  Instead of serving it like a steak (like I'm used to), it was cut up for me...I felt like I was 5 years old and not allowed to touch a knife.  I feel bad because our server was so nice!  I wish I could give 5 stars for the server alone, but unfortunately I went there for carne asada, not the waitress!
