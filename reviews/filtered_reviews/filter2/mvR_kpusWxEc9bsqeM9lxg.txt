After many friends suggested trying Three Amigos, I finally did.  After all it's in the neighborhood, close and I LOVE Mexican Food.

I could care less about ambiance if a place is clean and the food is good.  This works in my favor; the seating is tight, the restaurant is small and ill put together.  

Let's get to the food...  Huge portions and traditional Mexican restaurant menu items.    The chips have always been cold and stale (I've been here many times now), and the salsa is decent enough.

What keeps me from rating Three Amigos higher than a 2 is their continuous bad service.  Waitresses can't be bothered to look at you ever.  It's like I'm bothering them to be there.  Please don't ask to substitute anything, or you will be told "NO and I'll go get the manager to confirm."   I didn't even ask for the manger.  YIKES!  I've always felt rushed, unattended to and bothered by their service staff.  

I can forgive anyone for bad days, even an occasional bad meal...  overall Three Amigos has good enough food at fair prices, and I will probably continue to return based on that alone.  But understand you will not have friendly service (maybe a smile)  and seating is super tight.

Watch out Three Amigos if another Mexican Restaurant opens in Plaza Midwood your business may take a shift....
