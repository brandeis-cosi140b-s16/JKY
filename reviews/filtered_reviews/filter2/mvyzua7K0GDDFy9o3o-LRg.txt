A typical chain restaurant. In the city of Phoenix, there are way better Mexican places that are not chains. I would go elsewhere.

DO NOT GET THE MICROBREW BEER!!! I had the Pilsner and the Amber, and they both tasted the same. I have consumed over 190 different bottles of microbrewed beer, and I was stunned to see that a pilsner tasted the same as the amber. Also, the pilsner was cloudy, which is the opposite of what a pilsner should be. Pilsners are clean, clear and crisp with a thin body. The pilsner I had could be described as a confused Hefeweizen.
