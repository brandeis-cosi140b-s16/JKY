As I read other reviews about this place, I've come to realized that I might have ordered the wrong items because I was disappointed with my entire meal!
I'm from the mecca of Mexican food (Southern California), so I know what good Mexican food is about!!!

My husband and I decided to take a trip over Valentines weekend to Arizona to check out the Dodger's spring training in Glendale. I told him that we had to try out Arizona's version of Mexican food so he asked a local to recommend a great Mexican restaurant and they told us about this joint.  I got the two tamale plate with red sauce and my husband got the carne asada burrito along with chips and salsa. I didn't enjoy the tamales because it had a weird taste to it and the burrito was dry. The beans were actually the best part of the meal. The salsa could have been a little better, but the chips did seem fresh and crispy. Yeah, the places is a little run down and not "clean" as others say, but that type of stuff doesn't really bother me.
