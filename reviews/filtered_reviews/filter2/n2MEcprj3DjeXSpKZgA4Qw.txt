The chips were great the quesadilla was a nice big portion for being an appetizer. The endless chips with the three salsa's are a good choice as well, especially when its happy hour and your get that discounted price. The location was a huge plus, being that it is on the strip and in the mall. The street tacos that are served there as well are another plus when you are looking for something quick and good to eat.
 Now as for the reason for the two stars...Food is one thing and a huge part of a good review but what hurt this resturant in my eyes was the service. We were seated quickly and that was very nice, our waiter took our order  and had our drinks to us in no time, then that was the last we seen of him. Well we seen him but he was tending to the groups of three or more. And this was not to say that the place was packed, because when we go there the bar was not even full and that was the section we were in. I seen more of the bus boys, who brought our food to us and refilled our drinks. I had to get napkins and silverware from the table next to us since the waiter did not bring our food he would not have known that we needed them. Then when we were done with our "endless chips" we had to flag down another waiter to bring us our refill. Later when it was time to leave since we did not feel the need to stay, the bill was rang up incorrectly. I did not understand how we got happy hour prices on the food but not the drinks..Well luckily one of the managers or at least the men in suits were around because of course the waiter was missing. They corrected the order and we got the right bill...And that explains the zero tip left to our waiter.  
 Overall the resturant was nice, the decor was awesome, and maybe we just got the raw end of the deal on the section that we sat in...But thats why I gave the two stars.
