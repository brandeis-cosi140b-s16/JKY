Found this place on groupon and decided to try even though the reviews were mixed. Walked in for dinner on a Saturday night and this place was completely empty! Uh-oh! We knew what we were in for. Warm chips and two types of salsa were good. We ordered a side of refried beans to go with the chips while we looked over the menu which ended up being really good. I wanted a salad and the server said the chicken fajita salad was excellent. Ha! It looked incredibly boring and bland and tasted like it looked. The menu stated it came with black olives and it actually came to the table with ONE OLIVE.  My husbands chicken burrito with cheese and enchilada sauce was terrible. He said the tortilla had three layers to it so it was really doughy. The chicken had no flavor to it. He said it tasted like boiled chicken. I'm guessing this place is good for nachos and beer. But we will not be going back bringing out.
