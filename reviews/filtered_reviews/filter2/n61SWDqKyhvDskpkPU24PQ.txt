So good news they are open in Christmas eve. Bad news is guess is that they are open. 

Planned on going to Espos but they were closed. 

Ended up here. It's not terrible but let's be honest it's absolutely nothing to reccomend. 

Ordered margaritas...tasted like they were a mix. For good lords sake it's a Mexican place. Do those right. 
And they are little.

Also ordered the three amigos. Salsa. Guacamole and queso. The only thing I'd eat again is the queso. Delicious! We doctored the quac with the salsa and made it edible. It's the stuff they buy predone. 

Refried beans tasted canned. 

Ordered the burrito enchilada style with chicken. Mixed the red and green sauce on top. And cheese sauce on side. 

All sauces mixed is a good flavor. Chicken was chewy. 

Rice was bland. 

Had to ask for waters. 

Idk I wouldn't go again, my boyfriend said he would. But he had a little green today.  Not for me. 

Service was ....there.
