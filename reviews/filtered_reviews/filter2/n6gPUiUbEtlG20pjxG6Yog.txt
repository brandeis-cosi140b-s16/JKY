Having already purchased a living social deal for bottomless drinks and an entree, reading the reviews made me worried, but hey, it's already paid for, how bad can it be. Well prepare yourselves ladies and gentleman. It's bad. The drinks weren't terrible, the service was pretty good but wow, the food. Yuck. What wasn't burnt was flavourless. I really can't think of a reason to recommend this place. Don't trust a Mexican restaurant that charges you for chips and salsa. 

The service staff were friendly, polite and attentive but the quality of the food just lets this place down.
