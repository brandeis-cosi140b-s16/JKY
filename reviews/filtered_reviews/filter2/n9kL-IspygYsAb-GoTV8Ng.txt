I've been to this restaurant countless times since they first opened. The tacos are really tasty, and are the only reason I go back, because their service is certainly nothing to return for. When they first opened I figured they were still working the kinks out with their servers. Since they opened in 2012 and it is now 2014 and the service remains the same, if not worse, I am led to believe they just don't care that their servers are absolutely ignorant to how to serve people as well as being ignorant to customer service skills. From sitting at a table and waiting over 10 min to even be asked for a glass of water (only after I complained, mind you), to the same server continually getting portions of my entire  parties order wrong on several different visits, to absent waiters who act put out when you have to keep asking for things because you've been waiting for an extended amount of time even when the restaurant isn't busy....one can only conclude that they don't care about their customers as they keep these incompetent imbeciles employed at their establishment. If the tacos weren't so tasty I would certainly never return.
