Just a mediocre experience.

My friends and I had a reservation for 8 at 7pm.  We were seated immediately upon arrival on a busy Friday night in the patio area.  Our waiter was nice and made good suggestions.  The food is just okay; nothing to brag about.  The tacos are very expensive for what they give you (average price is $4 for a SINGLE small street style taco a la carte).  The tacos come out on a rack family-style.  So while in the dark environment of the patio and main dining area, you pay $4 for a tiny taco and have to search all over the table to find your taco (RIDICULOUS- the waiter tells you all the tacos on the rack and then you go racing to find yours).  The drinks are average for their prices.

After dining, my friends and I were chatting at the table and catching up (pretty normal post dining activity).  About 8:30pm, a hostess asked us to leave our table as they had to accommodate a reservation at 8:45pm.  WOW....I don't think I have EVER been asked to leave a restaurant.  She hostess did ask in a nice manner and handed out coupons for free tacos as to make up for asking us to leave. 

We ended moving our party to the outside of the restaurant to continue chatting.  By 9:30PM, no party had ever been seated at our table!   

I will never return to this restaurant.  Paying over $40 for 2 tacos and 2 drinks and being rudely asked to leave my table is just not worth it.
