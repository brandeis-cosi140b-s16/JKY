Finally made to Tacos Atoyac after many months of waiting. In my own opinion, after the wait and all the praise, I was disappointed. Menu items are very inexpensive, but also very small. The food did not taste bad; though it didn't knock me out either-- it just was. Not really sure where all the praise is coming from, but then again, it could be just me.
