Decided to try this place out with my boyfriend on Cinco de mayo since they were offering $2 carnitas tacos all day. Like all upward project restaurants, it has very cool, hip vibe with a decent size patio...definitely looked like a cool hangout spot to grab drinks with friends. Unfortunately I will not be returning as the food was nothing impressive & service was terrible. The only thing we did like was the complimentary chips & salsa. The tortilla chips were thin & crispy & the salsa was a nice, fresh roasted tomato salsa. So we tried the carnitas tacos...it was decent but nothing I would come back for. I've had way better street tacos elsewhere like Los Taquitos.  So If you're looking for authentic tacos, this is not the place.

As for the terrible service, maybe they were short staffed or that it was cinco de mayo but we came around 9:30-10:00pm (late dinner) and the restaurant was not that packed but a simple "sorry we're short staffed but we'll do our best to attend to your needs" would have sufficed & we could have forgiven them for their slow service, not refilling our water or the fact they constantly walked pass our table without acknowledging us.

Will not be coming back & definitely will not recommend this place to our friends.
