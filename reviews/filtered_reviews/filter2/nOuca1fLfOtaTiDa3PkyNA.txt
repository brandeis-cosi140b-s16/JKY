The food is good here but the employees not so much. They also never have salmon ready and have canned response of "we just ran out". Really? Because I have been in this long ass line for 20 mins and no one ordered it.   Speaking of lines, this is the slowest cafe rio I have been to.

Also, the cashier will try to confirm your order while they are still making it which is fun, I have yet to master the art of two conversations at the same time.  Why don't you let me finish my order before asking me what is in it?

Please fix your service issues  I prefer your food to Chipotle, but they never mess up my order and I will be going there more from now on.
