This used to be such a fun, energetic place to come. Now, I feel like I'm going to a funeral that has food. 

You enter through a gigantic outdoor patio that is never used. It really does not encourage you to come inside. The place once was more of a destination restaurant, rather than just a place to eat some crappy Mexican food (yes, Filli Bs is probably better).  The owners have sadly not maintained the restaurant or updated the menu. The food has become drab.

I'll be surprised if this place is around much longer.....
