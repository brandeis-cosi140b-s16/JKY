I like the food here, not quite Tacos El Gordo, but good. The killing point for me has been the poor service, rude cooks and the miniature portion cups at the self serve bar. On one occasion the system was down so the cashier could not process any card transactions. I told her I have cash and she said she could not get into the register because the manager has the key. I asked where the manager was. The cashier told me that the manager was busy with other things in the office......????

I cannot think of what could be more important than fixing a service or operational issue, especially the issue of receiving payment. This is one example of the negligence I have seen from the manager/owner and there have been other issues I observed. 

The cooks have always been rude at this location and have shorted me food even after I verified the count I asked for to what they said they packed. The cashiers rarely are able to offer answers or assistance with anything. It seems like someone new is being trained every time I visit. 

Food 4/5 stars
Service/customer relations 1/5
Management 1/5
