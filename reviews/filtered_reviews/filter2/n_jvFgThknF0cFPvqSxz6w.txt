This place is an OK place to grab lunch.  The food is OK and moderately priced.  Of course because it is in Las Vegas there are many better options if you take a minute to look.

Late at night though you should avoid this place.  We had walked by many times.  They are always playing good music and the energy seems good.  We finally went in and found that inside was a different story.  The crowd is a little lacking and the environment reminds you of spring break.  That is probably a good thing for some,  but not me.

It is tempting to stop in because you do not have the lines or high cover charges of Las Vegas clubs, but you will find that maybe the charge and wait are worth it.
