Gadzooks Enchiladas & Soup 
         "Just wasn't for me"


Gadzooks is a create-it-yourself restaurant with a hip and trendy vibe. Gadzooks offers enchiladas, tacos, chopped salads and house made tortilla soup. The staff at Gaszooks is accommodating, friendly, personable, and knowledgeable about the products they provide.  The atmosphere is stylish but very cramped. 

I guess I was really expecting more, considering all the positive reviews I read and this is why I feel terrible for saying the food at  Gadzooks was bland and poorly executed. On my first visit to Gadzooks I had the two enchiladas meal. First you select a bread. I choose corn tortillas,  Next it was time to select a meat. I  went with the braised short ribs. After you select your meat your ready to add the enchilada sauce. I choose the "Christmas" red and green,  two distinct sauces. Then your creation is topped with cheese, and  there are a few cheeses to choose from. I tried the Chihuahua Cheese. The medium size deep dish is then placed into a brick oven to bake. I added a few extras like Uncle Rico's pico and scratch made crema. 

To be honest the food just wasn't good. The enchiladas were bland and soupy. Even tho Gadzoooks offers numerous toppings, I think less is better. The enchiladas seem to be covered with as much cheese and sauce as possible and this took away form the flavor of the meat.  Gadzooks wasn't the worst food nor the best, just disappointing. 

  
However ending on a positive note I LOVED their chips.
