For all the hype this place had from fellow Yelpers, I was excited to try out Burrito Shack. Unfortunately, my visit provided me an experience equal to that of what I would expect out of a shack. The guy who took my order was rude, rushed me, and didn't care to try to explain or recommend anything. I was here at a time when nobody else was there, so I wasn't holding up a long line or anything. To just try something, I went with the Carne Asada burrito. This is a burrito that is really hard to mess up, but somehow they managed to. 

The menu is full of options, making it hard to direct anyone to what is "specialty." The building itself is pretty cool once inside though! Was cool to try out, but haven't returned since and don't plan to.
