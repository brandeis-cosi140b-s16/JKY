While there are some interesting twists with the menu, the abysmal service here would overwhelm even the highest quality food. The guacamole topped with pomegranate seeds was nice and interesting. The cochinita pibil was disappointing. The spice blend of that dish overwhelmed the meat rather than enhanced it. The plate presentations were consistently sloppy and generally were a good metaphor for the overall lackadaisical experience. But the service was what will prevent us from returning. Our waiter "Marcos" acted as if he'd rather be wallowing in pig manure than waiting on us. Even something as minor as getting a drink refill seemed to require an act of Congress. He even brought the change back in a wet folder.  Apparently being featured on a Food Network show has inflated the egos of the staff here. The food here isn't all that impressive. The service is what will really leave a bad taste in your mouth. Not worth the hype, the wait or your money.
