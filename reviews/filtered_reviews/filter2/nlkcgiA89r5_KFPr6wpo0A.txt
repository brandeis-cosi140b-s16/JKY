Las Velas' space on the second floor overlooking Market Square is among the best real estate on the square--great view, feels great especially when the weather is nice (they open great big windows when it's sunny).

The food, however, is another story. This is my third visit to this restaurant and probably my last. Although not of low quality--better than most Mexican restaurants I have visited in Pittsburgh and in SW Pennsylvania--this restaurant is by no means great, especially compared to others in downtown and around Market Square.

I had the burrito salad, a big disappointment. My greens and veggies were soaked in a salty and spicy sauce--yuck! It came with onions, mushrooms, bell peppers, black beans, chicken, and some kind of cheese sprinkled on top.

My advice: stay away!
