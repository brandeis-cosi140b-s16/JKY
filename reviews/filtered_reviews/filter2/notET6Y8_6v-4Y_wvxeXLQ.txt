Disappointed is the theme of this review. Mexican food? Where? I was served some hipster doofus version of "upscale Mexican fare." How does a Mexican Restaurant effectively mess up beans and rice? 

Don't expect chips and salsa. Unless you would like to pay $3.50 for 3 tablespoons of "salsa" and a handful of chips... you are out of luck my friend. It's not about the $3.50, I knew the price when I ordered it. It's not about the fact that I'm served free chips and salsa at the vast majority of Mexican places I've patronized. It IS about the portion for the price. Are you kidding me with this shit? 

"Pretentious Mexican food" is about as paradoxical as it gets. Skip it folks. You've been warned.
