I'm not seein' it, guys. My husband and I were eager to try Carlsbad Tavern after reading the Yelp reviews. The service WAS good, and very attentive. The complimentary chips and salsa were good; the salsa did have some kick to it. Our meals, however, were very lame. I had the blue corn enchiladas - one chicken, one shrimp - and honest to goodness, the "meat" had no discernible flavor. Not only could I not tell which was which, but couldn't identify a particular meat flavor at all; the ingredient was totally without flavor. My husband ordered the chile rellenos which he reported also lacked any discernible flavor; he said the only thing that had any flavor was the cheese. For dessert we had the sopapillas. No flavor there either! Granted, the meal was only $37 for two entrees, three sopapillas and two house margaritas (good flavor, verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry little alcohol). We were not inspired enough to go back. Bummer. Not a place for foodies.
