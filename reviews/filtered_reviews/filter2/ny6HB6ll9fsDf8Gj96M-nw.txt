I had a couple of hours to kill, belatedly realized that my headphones were in my checked luggage, and couldn't listen to the incessant announcements about how so and so needed to report immediately to whatever gate or a plane was going to leave them.  

Service was good but not necessarily great (I asked for no beans and got beans anyway).  It's a typical, busy airport restaurant.  The food was TERRIBLE.  But, again, comparatively speaking, airport food is never good.  I had the blue corn tacos; the tortillas were cold, the chicken looked weird, and the rice was also lukewarm.  The only good thing was the margarita, which was pricey ($16) but not bad.

On a positive note, the restaurant is big and a bit loud inside, so it totally drowns out the airport announcements.  A not terrible way to pass the time if you have time on your hands in Terminal C.  But don't go with any high hopes for the food.
