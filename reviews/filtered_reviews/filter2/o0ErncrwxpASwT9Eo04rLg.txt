This was my 3rd time to Cantina.  The first two visits were decent, but I thought a bit overpriced. My third trip was a dissapointment.  I brought out of town family. 3 of us ordered the Barbacoa - which was highly recommended by our server. I thought the meat was very salty. I was surprised when my other 2 family members who love salt said the same thing.  Then I knew it wasn't my imagination.  We made mention to our server and she apologized.  
My margarita was heavy on the sour mix and not terribly authentic.  For the price, there are many other lower priced options in the area.
