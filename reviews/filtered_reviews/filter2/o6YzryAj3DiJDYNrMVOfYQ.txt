As a regular customer of Los Dos Molinos over the years, I thought I'd give the Ahwatukee location a try even though the Mesa location is closer to home.

Upon arrival, I noticed the happy hour banner draped across the outside of the restaurant that advertised $1 off all drinks from 2-5pm.  My first thought was how disingenuous!  Kinda hard to take advantage of that happy hour when you work 9-5!

Since I was alone I sat at the bar and noticed some margarita glasses filled with pork rinds.  I didn't try one as i thought I'd wait for the chips and salsa.  I sat down and the fedora wearing bartender gave me a rather chilly reception, asked if I wanted a drink (I ordered a draft beer) and then he proceeded to bring me a menu and some chips and salsa.  Upon reviewing the menu I was hit with sticker shock!  I had tried to view their menu on their website but the link says "menu pending".  Had I seen the menu prices online I would not have come down here!  maybe it's a way to bait customers into coming in?  The bartender said something to the effect that "there are some price differences vs. the other locations."  Maybe their high prices are due to area demographics?

I ordered the carne adovada burrito which when served "enchilada xmas (red/green sauce) style" brought the price to around $15 with NO rice or beans!  

While waiting for my order I asked one of the bartender/servers if he could change the channel to the D'backs game and his response was "in a minute".  This typifies the service at Los Dos Molinos which has always been subpar.

My order arrived and the food was spicy and tasty though the burrito was on the dry side.  Checkout is performed using an ipad which if you've never used one of these was a little awkward.  The unit I used had a crack on the display which tells me margaritas and ipads don't mix!

$21.06 for a burrito and a beer!!  I won't be returning to this location.
