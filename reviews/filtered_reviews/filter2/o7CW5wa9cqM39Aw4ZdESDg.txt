We went there on a Sunday, because the other places we wanted to go were closed. I had been there once before and thought it was good. It is quite expensive. The margarita was just OK, tasted more like a very good smoothie, barely any alcohol. At $8 , I had expected more. 
The food was mediocre. For that price I was quite disappointed. The service was acceptable.
