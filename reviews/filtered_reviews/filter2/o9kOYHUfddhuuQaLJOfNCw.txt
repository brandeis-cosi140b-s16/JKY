Ehh... Foodwise, this place is okay.  But they're trying to be something I don't like.  They want to be a trendy place.  That's not what I want in a restaurant.

Upon entering, you're welcomed by one of the most confusing ordering set-ups ever.  You can't go to one person and order everything.  If you want tacos, go to the taco guy, burritos at the burrito guy, etc.  On top of that, the signage is terrible and confusing.  It's a terrible set-up.

Once you get your food and sit down, holding a conversation with others is nearly impossible.  They play techno and dance music at a volume where it makes it difficult to understand those with you.  Why do we need blaring techno?  Wouldn't some soft jazz or even quiet mariachi be more reasonable?  After all, this is a Mexican restaurant, not a night club.

The food was average at best.  There was nothing that stands out.  And no matter what anyone else says, it's NOT authentic. If you want authentic Mexican at a good price, check one of the Los Tacos locations. Real Mexican food in a nice atmosphere at a reasonable price.

As long as they keep their current concept, I will not be returning.
