I came here for dinner on a weeknight because I was intrigued by the venue and concept.  The first thing I noticed was that the prices seemed quite high for Chinese/Mexican food, but this was the Cosmopolitan, so not surprising.  We had a combination of Chinese and Mexican Food which was good, but really nothing special.  What really surprised me was the disjointed service.  All of our food was brought out piecemeal.  My girlfriend ordered two tacos and my buddy and I eached orded a soup dish.  My girlfriend got one of her tacos brought to her first.  Then she sat there and waited for my buddy and I to get our food, one at a time, several minutes apart.  Then my girlfriend's second taco came.  Bringing out the food piecemeal would make sense if it was a family-style meal, but I think it was pretty clear we each ordered our own dish.

The kicker was that we ordered chips and salsa, and didn't get it until we were almost done with our dinner, and then only after I asked about it.  The waitress was very friendly and pleasant, but this restaurant was just kind of off this night.

I think a restaurant that charges these kinds of prices for this kind of food needs to compensate by offering something unique, whether it be service, a special venue, etc.  I just didn't see it here, and there are way too many other great dining options in Vegas.  I'm glad I tried it, but will probably not go back.
