Not good. The outside seating is remarkable in itself. The view of the fountains, the ambience and the general people watching is some of Vegas's finest but the food? Yuk. The service, sad. We had appetizers and drinks...during what they call happy hour. The servers were far from happy. Each one looked and acted miserable. No smiles, no small talk just sad. The food was like frozen appetizers from your grocers freezer. And the frozen margarita special was lame. The cup was so small and a hundred of them wouldn't have given you the slightest buzz. Total dissapointment. Never again, no matter how hungry I am or how cool it looks. This place sucks.
