I live in NoDa but tend to avoid Cabo because I have never really had a great experience there.  And I actually wonder what I am missing when I read other peoples rave reviews.  But I was working from home on Fri and some former co-workers were heading there so I decided to suck it up and meet them.

It was packed at 12:15 and even though the 3 others were there they wouldn't seat them until I arrived.  Seemed odd for a place like that but okay.  When our waitress came by she was very abrupt with us and kind of slapped the menus on the table.

Someone else came by and threw the chips and salsa down.  My main complaint with this place is the chips suck, like seriously w/o fail everytime I go there they taste stale and cold.  Do they keep them in a fridge??  Not good.

We split the crab and shrimp dip appetizer, it was good and they pita crisps they give you tasted fresh.  I had the shrimp tacos w/no cilantro sauce because cilantro  makes me gag!  I was offered some honey wasabi sauce and I accepted but never received it.  Oh well, the tacos were actually pretty yummy on their own.  I got a side of the fruit but didn't eat it because it looks like it was really old and had a congealed look about it, no thanks.

Even though the food was good, I still just can't really get into this place, the service, the bad chips, in the past really bad margarita's.  I would much rather hit up Revolution or Solstice if I choose to eat out around home.
