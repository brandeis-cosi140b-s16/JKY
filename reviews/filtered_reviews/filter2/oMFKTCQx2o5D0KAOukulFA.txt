The chipotle cheese dip is good...and that's about it!  Two of the four entrees were made wrong, and when they brought out new ones, one was still made incorrectly (and we didn't even ask for many changes).  The prices wouldn't be absurd if the food was better.  All four of us agreed the meals were just mediocre.  Also, the portions were not reflective of the price.  I know that's typical of an "upscale" restaurant, but to fall short on both quality and quantity is disappointing, and not likely to bring customers back.
