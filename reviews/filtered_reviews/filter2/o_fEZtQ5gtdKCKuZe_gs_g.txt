I can give the food the second chance. However, I still find it unpleasant to be served by half-naked girls in the middle of the day. I am not a conservative and very attractive female who fells free wearing mini dresses and shorts. But, I absolutely find it inappropriate to get food from someone who barely covered. Where is the hygiene? Additionally, there are many other ways to present sexuality (if this is the policy of the place), mature ways that will attract different customers. Place lacks friendly smiling  personal, good selection of beer (Miller, Budweiser and etc topped by one or two local breweries choices). If you want attract customers who value good food, drinks, and service, you need to change some things around. Until then, I will think about ElHefe as a place where people come to get drunk by drinking shitty beer or poor quality drinks at high prices and look at booties! I may be rough with the way I wrote. I very seldom give negative reviews. In this case, I was highly disappointed by the place
