The pros: great looking place, feels like you aren't in Phoenix. Family rags-to-riches story is a great plus. 

The cons: inattentive waiter. Waited 20 minutes to be even greeted by a waiter, had to grab the support staff to flag someone down. When he finally showed up, he was underwhelming in service. Saw him three times the whole evening, and he left part of the order in the kitchen, we had to flag someone down to get the rest of it. Abondigas soup was lukewarm at best (been eating this here for years.) The food steadily has taken a dive over the past few years. Doesn't live up to the standards I've come to expect from the original restaurant. 

Really disappointed. Don't plan to visit again in the future.
