The food wasn't too bad, the experience really wasn't that great though.  The nachos were pretty good, as were the carnitas tacos.  The pastor tacos were sort of blah, of course I ate all of them but I wouldn't order them again.  Maybe I'm making an unfair comparison, the last time I had tacos al pastor was in Mexico.

We went to check out the happy hour, although the guy at the counter couldn't tell us what was going on for happy hour and couldn't tell us how much the beers were and didn't give us a receipt.  Seriously?  He was happy to take my $20 though.

The place is tucked away behind Cafe Rio, you'd really have to be looking for it to notice it.  Most of the walls of covered in teenage scrawling similar to Rebel Pizza.  I think most would agree that it really looks like crap.  Even the seats are covered in marker, I wouldn't wear light colored pants if I were you.

The best thing about Yayo?  The beer and tequila selection is extensive!
