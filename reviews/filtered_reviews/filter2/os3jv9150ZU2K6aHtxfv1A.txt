During the day: Food is marginal at best but margaritas are fantastic. The service is nothing to brag about.

At night: Usually a long wait to get in unless you are a Mill rat. Fun, high energy, usually pretty good music. Cheap drinks. My only gripe is the amount of people they let in at once. It's an ordeal to attempt to walk across the bar when it's busy to use the bathroom. Just a fair warning, you will be elbowed, spilled on, and occasionally shoved.

Bottom line: It was a sad day when Canteen closed.
