Wow! By far the worst experience we've had at a restaurant in a while! It all started when we had to wait almost 5 minutes before we were actually even greeted at the front. It was interesting because I said to my date a couple of times, "I think we should just go!" -- Well, you know what they say about intuition. I should've stuck with mine. Even then, I had a very open mind as I was craving some good Mexican food.

We were seated at a table close to the bar & ordered the Margarita & Basil Drop drinks. The Margarita came out in a decent amount of time but the Basil Drop took quite a while. The menu said there were to be muddled blueberries in it; there were none to be seen. I probably would've sent that back but my date was enjoying it so we continued sipping away.

After a few glances over the menu, I decided to get the Tinga Taco & the Shrimp Taco and my date went with the Veggie Burrito & the Crispy Pork Belly taco. Out of the Tinga Taco & Shrimp Taco, I definitely preferred the Tinga. The chicken was really delicious and went well with the cabbage and creama; the shrimp taco on the other hand was a little disappointing as it lacked flavor & the shrimp were too dense. I've never had Crispy Pork Belly before but it was ridiculously fatty so when I took a bite all I could taste was fat, highly unappetizing. The Veggie Burrito was really big & filling but left much to be desired.

I do have to make note that the service was awful! We checked in & got a free order of the queso and we didn't get it for at least half an hour later. It had such a weird texture, we didn't even it it, such a shame too because it took over an hour and a half to get our food. We were so disappointed & quite frankly, I was still hungry but we figured we'd go somewhere else for dessert! I'm giving the 1-star because I have to and 1 additional star for the Tinga Taco.
