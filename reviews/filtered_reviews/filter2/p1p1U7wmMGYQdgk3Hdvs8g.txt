Tourists.... 
Would love this place. I supposed that is why it is within walking distance of the Arizona Grand Resort. As for me, a longtime local, I could easily pass on this place. 
We asked to be seated on the patio in the shade. Turns out only half the table was covered and it was getting hot. We saw a bunch of umbrellas in the corner not be used and asked our server if we could have another umbrella to cover the two that were roasting in the sun. She got upset. She actually said no! My cousin decided to take matters into his own hands and get one. The server came flying over and told him that was against the rules. She is not allowed to take an umbrella from another servers section. Weird as there were not any patrons in the area. Her attitude sucked. She was very lucky that I was not deciding how much to tip. 
The chips were OK and the salsa was actually good. 
I had the chicken enchiladas, meh. The sauce had no flavor. 
The best part was hand feeding the ducks on the patio. 

The prices are outrageous for the caliber of food you receive. 

Skip it. Go somewhere that serves real Mexican food and provides friendly service.
