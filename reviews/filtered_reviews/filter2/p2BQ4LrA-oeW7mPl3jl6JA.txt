Flew into Vegas on a Thursday and was starving when we got here. We decided to give Diablos a shot. It was relatively cheap for Vegas standards and the food was ok. The service though was below par. Really long waits, pretty much no attention from our server. Someone from the kitchen delivered our food and sort of slammed the food down and left in hurry. 

I had the jalapino chicken tacos which were decent, and 1 beer. I was never asked if I wanted another...which I did.
