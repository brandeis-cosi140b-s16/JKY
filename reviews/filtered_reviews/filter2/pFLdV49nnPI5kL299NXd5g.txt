Cafe Rio was an experience, we were very rushed in the ordering line, while they were singing there enchilada cold stone song.  They messed up our burro orders giving our order to someone else, and having to re-make our burro.  The line was chaos, the sound was chaos and it was average food.  The lighting in the dining room was a little dim for day time.  The TWO good things were.... the tortillas (YUM YUM) and the wide selection of lemonade drinks.
