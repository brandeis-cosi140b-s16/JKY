Don't think I'd come back- food was okay- very little spice. Service was poor.  Charged extra for black beans even though it was an option on the menu.  Took margaritas away before we were done.  Not sure what folks see in this place....I can get much better Mexican food in Chicago.  It gets two stars because the margaritas were good.
