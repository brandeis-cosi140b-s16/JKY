I have a few favorite Mexican places that I rarely stray from, but I had a friend in town for CES staying at the Luxor and this is where she wanted to go.  We didn't have reservations and the place wasn't busy, but the hostess sat us at a counter-like space facing out towards the casino and rooms.  

Our server was super friendly and the food came out fast, so no complaints there.  

I ordered carne tacos, and my friend ordered chicken fajitas.  We also both ordered a glass of Sangria.  For a $15 plate of tacos, it was a very small portion.  3 tiny tacos with what looked like mexican rice and black beans.  The mexican rice was not good and tasted like something you would make out of a box.  I'm not a black beans fan so I can't comment on that.  The tacos were okay, like something I could get at Roberto's for a couple bucks.  

The sangria was overly sweet and not worth $8.

Overall, it was over-priced for just-okay Mexican food.
