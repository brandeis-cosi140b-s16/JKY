Once was in the Barrio, now in the boardroom  fortunately.  I made it out, but the memories of where I came from and where I am have never left and remind me daily of the difference between success and failure. 

Before I go on too long, the bottom line is I would recommend taking a pass on Barrio Queen.  Prices are a bit steep based upon the quality and presentation of the food. 

I also found the staff a bit pretentious in asking if I wanted change from my $100.00 bill for a $52.00 check. 

I note this because conceptually Barrio Queen tries to make the right choices for the most part. but comes up a bit short, as in the narrow difference between success and failure. 

Barrio Queen is conveniently located.  When my wife, daughter and I dined the restaurant was clean with attractive decor and intriguing menu items.  The one issue I have though with "trendy" Mexican restaurants is the use of black beans and the omission of pinto or other types of beans historically consumed by natives of Mexico and Central America.  We were told by the server that the restaurant does not serve rice and only black beans true to native Mexico. 

I found that a bit odd based upon my knowledge, travel and consumption of Mexican and Latin American foods based upon many factors, including travel throughout Central and South America. 

I found the tacos to be decent but with no sauce to add to compliment the presentation and the guacamole to have 1/4 avocado size chunks (perhaps intentionally) with minimal flavor. 

The one thing Latin food should have is flavor.  Some of my best meals have been in dives and dumpy looking restaurants.  Unfortunately, Barrio Queen comes up short in the food category, beautiful setting but below average cuisine and certainly not worth the price.
