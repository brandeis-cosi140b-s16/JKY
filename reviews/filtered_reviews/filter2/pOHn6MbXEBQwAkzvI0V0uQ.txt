If you are cheap and staying in Bally's, then you should come here. Otherwise, the food is only okay and I am sure there are better options that are in a similar price range, even though dining tends to be pricey in Vegas. 

We ordered the chips and salsa, the $2 tacos, and then two of us vegetarians got the taco salad minus the beef. Everything was okay, just the service took a long time...we basically had to beg to get or bottomless chips and salsa refilled. Also, the food took a long time to come, as well as everything else. I probably won't come here again unless I find myself staying in Bally's another time.
