DC had a Living Social voucher for this place with the amusing name.  We were both craving some Mexican-style food, so we stopped by to see how Nacho Daddy fared.

We both ordered pretty standard entrees, tacos for me and enchiladas for DC.  We skipped the Nachos, not really a favorite for either of us.  While we were waiting for our entrees to be brought out we were each given one corn jalapeno muffin to snack on.  This thing was pretty darn tasty, and I was hoping it was foreshadowing for the rest of the meal.

It wasn't.  When the food finally arrived (more on that later), it was pleasantly average.  My tacos had a nice mango salsa that was crunchy and cool.  The fish was pretty mild and the tortilla was almost stale tasting (odd for a place that has a giant tortilla press behind a glass window).  DC said his enchiladas were absolutely forgettable.  No real flavor or otherwise distinguishing characteristics.

Our service was about the same - the waitress was pleasant but didn't really go above and beyond.  Our food came out eventually, plates burning from sitting under the heat lamp.  The table across the way came in after us and received their food before us, and we only got one follow up that our food would be out shortly.

All in all, this experience was completely average.  Nothing stood out and there's no real reason for me to go back.  I'd probably give it a second chance if I had a coupon or another Living Social voucher, but otherwise not.
