This was my first visit to Taco Haus and will be my last. My son and I waited 3 minutes before we were greeted and seated. The restaurant was not that busy. They don't have enough servers. It was five minutes before we had a waitress come to our table. I had the pork belly tacos. The meat was so dry. It had must have been cooked hours before. When the waitress finally made it back to our table, I requested another margarita. Five minutes later she dropped off our bill and no margarita. Their management definitely needs improvement. This restaurant is not worth the wait or food. I recommend trying Taco Guild.
