China Poblano was the first restaurant I ate at after arriving in Las Vegas, NV. We couldn't find Secret Pizza at the time, so we decided to eat here. The hostess kindly seated us immediately. The menu has a variety of items. We ordered fried wontons, queso fundido, and chicken ji song (lettuce wraps). The chicken ji song was my favorite dish. China Poblano lettuce wraps was fresh and the ingredients blended well together. The fried wontons and queso fundido was average at best in my opinion. I chose mango sticky rice for dessert. China Poblano sticky rice was innovative compared to other restaurants I've visited. The unique spin on the mango sticky rice was cool literally (served cold). I enjoyed every bite of my mango sticky rice. The sticky rice is perfect for a hot Las Vegas day. Our server wasn't very attentive (restaurant was not busy). We had to flag her down for refills constantly. The ambience at China Poblano is awesome. It's a good place for drinks and enjoying the Cosmopolitan eye candy. I personally expected more from some of the dishes but they didn't hit the spot for me. The presentation of meals deserves two thumbs up! I give China Poblano a 2.5 rating.
