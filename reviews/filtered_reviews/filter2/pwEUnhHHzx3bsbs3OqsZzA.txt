Not pleased at all by this place. We usually have a fairly large group when we go out on Thursdays, but service was horrible. It took almost 10 minutes just to get an iced tea. I was not impressed by the food for the price either. Furthermore, our server mixed up the cards for the split tabs and didn't even tell us about the mistake or even apologize. After talking to management they told me they were too busy to look into my issue and they would call me back when business died down, and never did. The only reason for more than one star on the review is because I called back again and the manager Sean looked into my issue and apologized on behalf of the rest of the staff.
