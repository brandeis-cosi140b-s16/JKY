More of a Tex-Mex than authentic Mexican food.  Had the chicken & shrimp enchiladas.  Rice was very dry.  Green chile sauce overpowered taste of chicken and shrimp.  Husband had the pork burrito with red sauce.  Had good flavor but was spicy.  Also ordered the green chile mashed potatoes because they sounded interesting.  Very bland.  Needed salt and pepper.  Sopa tasted like toasted bread.  Great service but overall food disappointing.
