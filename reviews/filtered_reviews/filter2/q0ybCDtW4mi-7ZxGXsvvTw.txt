I'm willing to chalk my bad experience up to "working out the kinks", but still don't think I'll be back. 
The good news: The place was packed on Friday night at dinner time. I got my food to go and the staff were very polite and accommodating. The food was hot and the salsa that came with it was great. 
The bad news: I ordered a chicken torta for my husband and got beef instead. I ordered a vegetarian burrito for myself and there was A) a big piece of meat in it and B) a long hair in the center. That ended dinner pretty quickly for me.

Disappointing...I was hoping this would be a great new go-to local place.
