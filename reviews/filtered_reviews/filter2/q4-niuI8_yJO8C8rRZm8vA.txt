I really don't understand why this place is so popular either. Shit filibertos is better than this place. And thats bad. 

This place is a couple blocks away from me so I have eaten here a few times. I was expecting at least a little bit of awesomeness from the yelp reviews but what I got was something I couldn't even finish. 

The tortillas aren't even that great, like laura said they seem a bit undercooked. 

This place also seems unnecessarily busy sometimes. The front cashiers seem to be very annoyed by that fact. Every time I have been here the front cashiers seemed to be annoyed teenagers who care less about getting your order right and more about clocking out.
