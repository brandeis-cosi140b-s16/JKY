My friends and I decided to eat here for dinner before heading to Marquee which was nice because the restaurant was straight across from the entrance. My boyfriend and I got some tacos and only one stood out.... I think it was called Viva China. Other then that the food was meh.... the famous fried rice was just ok... 

Also... Unless you LOVE vinager, DO NOT order the Huitlacoche Noodles! My friend ordered this dish and she mixed it, tried it, hated it... passed it around and we all tried it and it literally tasted like stuff soaked in vinegar. She told the waiter that she did not enjoy it and that we all tasted it and felt the same and the waiter told the manger who came by our table. The manager asked my friend, did you mix it?  and she said yes and he said something a long the lines of if you didn't know how to eat it, why did you order it and said there was nothing he could do.... really?!?!?!?!? we were a party of like 16 spending A LOT of money at your restaurant and he said he couldnt do anything for us???? wow.... 

2 stars for convenience being right across from where we had to be/getting reservations for a large party 2 hours before showing up.... and 1 star for the Viva China... but I'd rather give 0 stars for the horrible customer service.
