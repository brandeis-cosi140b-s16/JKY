Went here this evening with my friend, she had been a few times with her co workers. Initially walking in the door the girl at the front wasnt very friendly when we asked about happy hour. She was a lil snippy and no reason to be. Sat down the waiter was very friendly and nice although I dont recall his name. He was very attentive and got our drinks and chips quickly. The menu I felt was way over priced 12.99 for 2 chicken enchiladas with beans& rice. Everything was 12.99 and up.. the food was flavorless except the green sauce. Felt like for the price it should have been alot better. I've been going to Chapala's for years and thought id try this spot but I have to say no comparison at all. I can't say I will go back again here.
