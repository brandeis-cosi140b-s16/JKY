Although I have been here a few times, I wasn't very impressed with the food or the service. They offer Happy Hour from 4:30pm - 6:30pm M - F. We went Monday at 5pm and were quickly seated in the main room. We asked about the 1/2 price appetizers for happy hour but were told that it was in the Cantina room only. After already been seated and served drinks, we didn't want to move to save a couple of dollars but it left a bad taste in our mouth. Service was slow. We order a 2nd round of drinks as we got our entrees and they didn't arrive until we were finished eating. My "Top Shelf" Margarita tasted like soap water. Although my shrimp taco's were good, my wife's grab meat rellenos was terrible. My son ordered the cheese casadilla which had chillis. He thought it was too spicy so he didn't eat it. I think this place is starting to go down hill.
