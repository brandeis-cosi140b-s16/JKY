Horrible. Horrible Service. Waiter never came by to check in on us and he forgot our chips and salsa plus a kids menu. Everyone was done with their meals and we still had no chicken tenders. Our food was mediocre and cold. The only thing I enjoyed was the grilled corn on the Cobb. Overall experience was horrible and I would recommend to go elsewhere.
