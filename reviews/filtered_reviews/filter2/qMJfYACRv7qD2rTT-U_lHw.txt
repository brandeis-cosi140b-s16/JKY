Coupla issues:

1.  First TINY basket of chips is free.  If you want a larger, second basket, it costs $1.  I can understand that policy if the chips and salsa both were COMPLETELY OFF THE HOOK! but they weren't.

2.  Had to go ask for a chip refill after the first tiny basket vanished in about 2 minutes.

They were really friendly though.  And the food was decent, but far from the best in town.  Standard rice, standard beans.  The tostadas and tacos were the best thing we tried.

There are just too many places better than this one to put it into my rotation.....
