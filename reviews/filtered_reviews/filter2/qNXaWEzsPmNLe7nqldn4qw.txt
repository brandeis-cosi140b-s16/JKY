I was excited when I walked in- the atmosphere was great and I liked the decor. The chips were crisp and the salsa mild. The staff were very accommodating. I ordered the chicken taco salad. It was VERY bland and watery. The "homemade" guacamole was also very bland. My 7 yr old had the chicken which was pretty dry. Sorry- El Pollo Loco has tastier food. Will not be back.
