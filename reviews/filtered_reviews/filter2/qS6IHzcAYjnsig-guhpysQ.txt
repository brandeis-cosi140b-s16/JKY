We typically love this place, especially on Sundays because kids eat free! However today we walked into a nearly empty restaurant and were told we'd have to wait 10-15 minutes. Obviously they didn't have enough staff to support the number of tables but the hostess was rude and having to wait when the restaurant is empty seems ridiculous. Then our food took forever to arrive.  After about 20  minutes of waiting for our food we were about to leave when it finally arrived.  Everything was ok.  Not bad as the food here is typically pretty good.  Management needs to figure some things out.  I will say our waitress was pretty good.  She checked on us often, apologized several times and was very attentive to our needs.
