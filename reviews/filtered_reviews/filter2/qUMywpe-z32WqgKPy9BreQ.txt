My wife and I went here last night.  We had a shrimp dish and the carne asada.  The steak tasted salty which was weird.  The shrimp was a little too chewy.  Not great overall.  The service was good, lots of helpful guys.  The reason for only two stars was the after-affect the next morning of Montezumas revenge for both of us.  That was an experience we could have had at a roadside taco shop.  No amount of free alcohol would make me 'Vote Benito'  Thanks.
