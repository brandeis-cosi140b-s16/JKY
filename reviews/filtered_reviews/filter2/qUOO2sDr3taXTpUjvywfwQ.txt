I went here with my parents the other day because they had a coupon.

I ordered the shrimp verde enchiladas. When they arrived, they were chicken. I called the waiter over and told him I couldn't find any shrimp in my shrimp enchiladas. He apologized and got me a new order...which had shrimp. The enchiladas were okay but I probably wouldn't order that again.

My mom had Baja enchiladas which she loved. My dad also liked his beef taco and Baja burrito.

We all got the chicken tortilla soup to start, which was very good.

I wasn't overly impressed with my meal but may have just ordered the wrong entree.

The salsa served with the chips was less than stellar.
