I was not impress with the food at Cabo Wabo Cantina Las Vegas . I went there with my friend, because we were super hungry and we were craving Mexican food. 
The portions are small and they are very, very pricy. 
We spend over $60 for 2 plates. 
Our waiter was nice, but still it wasn't worth it. I can get the same meal for $20 some where else.
