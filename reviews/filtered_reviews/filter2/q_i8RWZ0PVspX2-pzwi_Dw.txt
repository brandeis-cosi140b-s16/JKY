Aunt Chilada's is a pretty standard American Mexican place. The food was pretty basic and no frills. I would not get the quest dip because it looked and tasted like cheese whiz. My enchiladas were warm but lacked flavor as did the beans and rice it was served with. The only part I would consider getting again was the fried ice cream.
