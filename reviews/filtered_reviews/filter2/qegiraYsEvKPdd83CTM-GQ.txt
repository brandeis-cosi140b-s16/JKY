I went here with some coworkers for happy hour and was not so impressed. The restaurant itself has a nice location overlooking Market Square, but the service and food were not great.

We took advantage of the happy hour special on margaritas and those were decent. Everyone enjoyed their drinks, which were huge and pretty strong.

Appetizers are also half-off during happy hour, so we decided to order a bunch to split for dinner. Among the things I tried were the sopecitos; four thick corn tortillas that were topped (one each) with chicken, steak, carnitas, and chorizo. The meat was okay, but the tortillas did not taste fresh. Also, the dish was only lukewarm when served.

I also tried the empanadas which were okay. I ordered them with beef. There really isn't much I can say, they were just bland and "meh."

There were a few other dishes that were not very memorable. The one thing that we all loved were the flautas. I wish we had just gotten several plates of these instead of everything else!

We also had issues with the service. The food took almost an hour (for appetizers!) and one of the dishes was incorrect once it was finally brought out. I sent it back and did not request a replacement, but the incorrect dish was still on my check. I had them remove it but the whole experience was annoying.
