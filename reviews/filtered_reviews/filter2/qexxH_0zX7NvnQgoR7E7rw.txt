Food was cold and the 12oz margaritas were way to expensive.  We just got 2 regular on the rocks and they totaled $15.  Come on they were not even top shelf.  Anyways, we got our food after a 30 minute wait and let's just say it was not hot.  Tacos were very small and barely anything in them.  I HATE complaining but this place is not what it used to be.  I didn't even know the one on University closed down.  Maybe we will try again this summer to see if it was just a fluke.
