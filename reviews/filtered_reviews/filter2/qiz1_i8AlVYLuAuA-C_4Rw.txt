Recently moved to the area and anxious to try this local Mexican restaurant.  The outside is nicely light up with white lights and leads into a large outdoor courtyard area with firepits.   That is where the attraction for this restaurant ends. We were there on a busy evening and many families with kids loud or running around ruining even the outdoor courtyard experience.    At a family restaurant this can be overcome with good food and ambiance but we were seated in their 'overflow' room that felt very cafeteria despite the huge opportunity to create a authentic atmosphere in this home converted to a restaurant.  Water was served in plastic red cups and our margarita on the rocks was served warm.  The food was very bland with no attention to plating with any garnish.   My shrimp enchilada was not worth eating.  The chips were good as well as the bean dip with the salsa but we will not be returning.
