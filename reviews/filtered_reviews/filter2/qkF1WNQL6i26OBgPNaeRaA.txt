We were really excited to try the Border Grill. When we arrived, we were seated promptly with a reservation on a busy Saturday night. That's when it went downhill. 

We ordered our appetizers right away with our drinks, but 45 minutes went by before we actually got them. Our appetizers were soggy - you could just tell everything had been sitting. We were too hungry to send it back, especially since we had no idea how long it would take the second time. The plantain empanadas tasted good, and I enjoyed the spice of the quinoa fritters. Which I suppose at one point were crispy. 

Our entrees had also been sitting, and arrived right as our appetizers were being cleared, resulting in our having no silverware. Everything had sort of started to congeal together. Unable to flag anyone down I had to resort to taking utensils off of another table. 

The pork special had very nice flavors, and my husband inhaled his chicken mole. The salad that accompanied the mole was quite tasty! 

I think the food would be good if delivered promptly but I would not return due to the service. Maybe eating over in the bar would be better.
