Come for live music, appetizers, and drinks (no dinner...)Thought it would be fun to eat and enjoy some live music while sitting outside, but we we were a little disappointed. The food was so so, and the service was a little less attentive/ fun than desired. I had the BBQ pork, which had great flavor, but the meat was so dry I didn't even want to finish the sandwich. Sweet potatoe fries were good though. We don't plan on coming back unless there is a good band and we are craving wings or nachos.
