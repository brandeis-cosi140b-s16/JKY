I guess I went to a different restaurant than everyone else because Taqueria Guadalajara had nothing great going for them! It is small and loud to start with, but that is easy to get over in exchange for banging food.  We had six of us dining and we all ordered something different.  We were all very disappointed as the food was bland and just not very good.  The service wasn't great either as half of the table received their food quite a while before the other half.  I have to say after reading the reviews, I was excited to try this place and hopefully find a decent place for Mexican food in Madison..I guess I will keep looking...
