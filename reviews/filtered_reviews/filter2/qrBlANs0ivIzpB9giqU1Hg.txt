For being in the heart of old town, surrounded by so many good places, my expectations were high for this place. I was very let down. I ordered takeout and to my surprise, it was nothing special. The burrito was huge and tasty but there are so many phenonmenal Mexican places I don't think I'll be back. The gorgeous bar looked good for happy hour drinks and shots though =)
