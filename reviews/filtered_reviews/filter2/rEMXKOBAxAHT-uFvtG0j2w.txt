Came here for Mother's day 2014. Sign said open at 9am, but the doors were still locked.  As we were walking a lady said the door will open shortly.  9:15 the door finally open, guess who opened the door...yup the lady that was walking from her car.  Can you say getting to work late?!

Anyways we order chilaquiles, one with red sauce and the other with green sauce with eggs.   It was okay.

Two kids plate,  one had a long hair in the rice. Yuk as my daughter commented.  They comp one of the kids meal and gave her a plate of new rice.

Julio did an excellent job, but the women Griselda (i think that is how you spell her name) was rude. She didn't acknowledge when we ask for things and her body language came across very negative.  What a disappointment since it was our first and probably will be our last time here. 

Thanks for an unforgettable start to mother's day. 
Glad we still have the entire day to make more memories.
