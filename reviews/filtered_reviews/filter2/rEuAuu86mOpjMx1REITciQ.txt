Um. Ew. I know airport food is supposed to be overpriced and still suck, but this was just plain bad. Luckily I was so famished that the bloated feeling I had afterward was oddly welcome. But while eating my burrito, everything about it was just bland. No taste to it at all, even after dumping an entire cup of the "hot" green salsa on it. The green salsa isn't hot at all and mild at best. I'd say try to look for something else, although I think in this airport you'd be finding a diamond in the rough. Maybe just stick to the known chains or pizza.

Positive note, the female cashier was nice?
