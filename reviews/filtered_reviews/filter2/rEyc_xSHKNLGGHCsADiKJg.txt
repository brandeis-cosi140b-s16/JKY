If you like copious amounts of sodium, this is your place. They could easily rename this restaurant "Salt Death" and it would fit perfectly. 

This is no place to write home about. 

Do yourself a favor, get a beer or two at the bar before going to a better venue, take a picture in front of the PINK TACO neon sign, and then leave. Forget about this place, never go back. 

I had the Chicken Fajitas, but I could have easily eaten the same exact meal at any Chili's restaurant or Chevy's any day of the week. The chips and salsa were decent. We asked for a top-shelf margarita and it was not that great.

The only amusing part of our meal was a large boned girl sitting at the bar with her friends. Her ENTIRE ass was hanging out the back of her pants. It was amusing, but did nothing to give this place more than 2 stars. 

Sorry Pink Taco, I will never return. Just another part of the Hard Rock Hotel that sucks.
