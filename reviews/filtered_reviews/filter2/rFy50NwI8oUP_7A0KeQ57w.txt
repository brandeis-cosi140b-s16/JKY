Our gym is located just down the street from the place, and we have been watching the hard work they have been putting into building the place and making what was once an eye sore to a wonderful and clean looking establishment. When my husband and I finally noticed the place we had watched develop was open for customers we were excited. We often do not go out to eat, we would rather eat in, but we had to try this place, maybe because we were super excited, and made it out to be more in our minds, but on the day we went in, it was one disapointment after another :(. I will give the place on how clean and nice it looks 5 stars, but the salsa..although freash, it lacked flavor and most of them were so hot you couldnt even taste your food over the heat in your mouth :( The meat (beef) was so greasy and lacked flavor that unless you put a tons of lime on it, it was very unenjoyable to eat :( The price was high, and the portions small, and the chips and salsa, I belive, are the same chips I could buy from the local market :( Also we could not find one napkin in the whole place, and the service, although kind, was very unorganized. We do not want to be 100% negative, again, we give the owners 5 stars for making an establishment look so wonderful in Mesa that was once an eye sore, but wish that more money would go into less grease and more flavor all around:) -two mesa people :)
