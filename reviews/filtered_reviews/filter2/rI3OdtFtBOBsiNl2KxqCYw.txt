I wanted to like this place. We ventured here for AZ Spring Restaurant Week... The menu sounded delicious, but it really wasn't- We ordered the tortilla soup, which was supposed to have chicken in it, it was so "fishy" tasting I'm really not convinced it was chicken, not to mention it was one big hunk of "chicken" which needed to be cut with a knife. Under no circumstance should soup require a knife. Once we mentioned this to our server he started avoiding us, our water glasses ran dry... food came out in a strange order... Things I did enjoy included the ambiance, its a really funky fun place with good music and colors :) Overall we just found this place laughable. Probably won't return- but it was interesting while it lasted.
