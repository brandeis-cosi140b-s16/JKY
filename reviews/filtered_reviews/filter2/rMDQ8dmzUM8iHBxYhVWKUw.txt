Our server jason was awesome we had a movie to get to and only had a half hour and he made it happen , wish the food was as good as the service , rice is bland and the beans are terrible need to give it some more flavor , fish tacos were ok , and my girlfriend had the enchilada and meatball soup was really good , but same complaint rice ans beans are terrible , overall wasnt too bad though .
