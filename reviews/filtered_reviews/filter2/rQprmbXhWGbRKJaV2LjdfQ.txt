I really wanted this to be great, I was looking forward to going... 
I love the building.. 
We go in on a Tuesday night, it's not too busy. The hostess was immediately available, and asked if we wanted to sit inside, outside, high top, low... So far so good... And then bam... Screeching halt to the good experience. One of the disgruntled servers rudely stops her from seating us, to gripe at her about a small group that was waiting outside. (Mind you, there are plenty of open tables) He actually took the menus from her, and sent her away to go clean off a table outside!! He was standoffish, and had no idea where to seat us because he interrupted the hostess from doing her job, so he takes us over to a dirty table, so we can stand there awkwardly while he cleans it off, seats us with no menus, and not another word. BAD FORM TACO GUILD. 
Our actual server came up, and was apologetic, offered us an appetizer on the house, which was a very nice gesture, and you could tell he was trying to make up for the debacle that we dealt with when we walked in. The meatballs, are interesting, the duck and steak tacos are delicious, but ultimately, the food isn't good enough to cover up the half a** service and the unusual mix of country music and old school hip hop that is playing...
