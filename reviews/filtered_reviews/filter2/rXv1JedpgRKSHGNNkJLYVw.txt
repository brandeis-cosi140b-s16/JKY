Me and my friends decided to try this place out due to all the great yelp reviews, but I was disappointed.  I got the carne asada tacos and chicken tacos, which were a $1 each because it was happy hour, and they tasted ok.  The food is very generic like a chain Mexican restaurant something like Baja Fresh,  The service was great and the place is pretty nice.  Just the food was average and wasn't satisfying.
