If you are a someone that orders the same thing every time you go to a restaurant because you hate to get something that you don't like and feel like you wasted your money. This is not the place for you. I ordered the pork burrito that my waitress suggested and I didn't like it at all. It had a weird flavor. This was definitely not the restaurant for me. I liked the chips and avocado dip. I have a more boring palate. My kids got fish tacos and didn't like them.  My husband got shrimp tacos and liked it fine. It was a waste of a lot of money for me.
