This review is painful to write, but the truth is I used to looooove Round Corner Cantina. It was one of my favorite places. I loved the outdoor seating and the tacos were amazing. I took friends from California there and they said the tacos held up to CA standards. But the last few times I have gone have been disappointing. The tacos were no longer as flavorful as they once were. Last night, however, was one of the worst meals I've had anywhere in a long time. I had the brisket tacos. They were cold and the meat was both dry and slimy and completely without taste. I had a bite of my companion's burrito and it was quite a bit better, but still. The food here has been getting worse for some time. It's quite the disappointment because I used to love this place so much.
