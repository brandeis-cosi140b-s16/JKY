I'll take any old Robertos anyday over this place.
If I never went there again I'd be fine, but my wife will never change her mind....All I can hope for is that they go completely out of business soon :) jk! 
Tacos are worse than taco bell and 4x the price...soggy chimichangas full of sloppy meat for 10 bucks.... It's pretty bad...unless you grew up eating it and that's all you know, I guess?
P.S. WORST SERVICE EVER AT THIS LOCATION.
