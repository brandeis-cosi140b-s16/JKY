I expected a lot more from a dish that is the namesake of a restaurant. That's some greasy, flavorless fish, CFT. For shame. While I commend you for giving me a lot of food, it simply was not good.

I also have an issue with the corn salsa that come with the chips at the table. I love corn salsa IN a dish. But, it makes for some seriously awkward dipping with just chips. 

The kernels...they were...everywhere.
