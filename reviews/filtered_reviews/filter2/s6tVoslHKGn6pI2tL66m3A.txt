Mediocre food, at most. The fish tacos were pretty lame; almost no flavor, but the rice was quite tasty. Refried beans were nothing new, and the guacamole... come on, even I can make better guacamole! My friend got the enchiladas, which she said were nothing short of mediocre. Mediocrity seems to be the theme at this place, but at least the food came out amazingly fast. The chips were not that tasty,  but the salsa was actually quite good. Price, again, was moderate but considering the quality of food should be considered as expensive garbage as the food here isn't quite worth the price you pay for it.


Avoid if possible, it's Las Vegas... there are plenty more places that you should go to instead of here!
