This looked like a fun place to have lunch but actually getting our food proved to be a challenge. We got our drinks, at least I did but my wife's came 5 minutes later. We ordered and waited, boy did we wait. Our food arrived but the orders were wrong except for a side of rice.  When we did get our order it was good. I got the steak quesadilla and she the pulled pot sandwich which was rich and spicy.  Portions were decent sized and well prepared. Low marks for the long wait and order confusion. Drink portions also seemed small for the prices (lots of ice in those margaritas they proudly display)
