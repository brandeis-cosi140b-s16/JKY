This place always seems like good idea... And then I realized I forgot how bad it is. The unique tacos sound great and are so creative, but the food is such low quality. Yesterday I came for 3 different tacos and rice and beans. The rice seemed old and tasteless... Like rice you might reheat in your microwave from leftovers last night. The chicken in the southern comfort taco was cold, gummy, and tasteless.  It was inedible. The other two were something I was able to get down, but no better than that only because of the quality of the ingredients (backyard BBQ and el pastor tacos). The only thing I would stop by for is the chips and salsa (so good).  Bottom line: good ideas but until Tex improves the quality of their food stay way.
