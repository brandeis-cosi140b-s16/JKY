I had lunch here again the other day and I realize I was either very high or absolutely starving last time I ate here. This visit I pretty much had the opposite experience. The food was horrible. The salsa had chunks of tomatoes as big as my fist, the burrito was dry and bland. They sat us in a room under a TV and it was so loud we could barely talk. I'll have to go back though... At least give them one more shot..
