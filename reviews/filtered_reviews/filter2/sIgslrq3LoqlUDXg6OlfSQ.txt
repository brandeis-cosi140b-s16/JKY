I have been here multiple times but after tonight I will not be coming back. I tried to call 6 times but the phone was off the hook. When I arrived I told the woman and she look confused, grabbed the phone and goes "I guess I didn't hang up the phone after the last call I picked up". I literally started calling an hour and a half before I wanted to arrive because it was my Fathers birthday so I wouldn't have to wait and I ended up waiting for 20 minutes anyway. She said sorry but she didn't do anything else. When I was finally seated there were no place setting or silverware. I asked for the queso, in which the waiter told us they were out of queso. Seriously, how does a Mexican restaurant run out of queso?! It was honestly just an annoying experience and not how I wanted to celebrate my fathers birthday. The food is good but the service ruined it for me.
