called in an order for chicken mole enchiladas, cheese enchilada with chicken tostada, and an order of flan. I was told it would be 20 minutes and when I showed up after more than 20 minutes I had to wait an additional 10 minutes for my order. The restaurant was not that busy. When I got home with my order they forgot my flan. I went back to the restaurant and the hostess knew exactly why I was there because she forgot the flan. I had to wait an additional 10 minutes while she seated another party and assisted another party with paying for their meal until I got the flan that she forgot. All I received was an apology and nothing else. No offer of a discount on my next visit or a discount on my order that I had placed. When I finally got home to enjoy my meal, it was mediocre at best. The mole was bland and anything less than good. it barely tasted like mole and more like thick gravy. The beans and rice we're nothing special and tasted like your run-of-the-mill Mexican fare. The best part was the pico de Gayo and cilantro. That was at least fresh and had the most flavor. Highly disappointed with my experience and not sure that I will ever return. Far better choices for Mexican food in the SW area. Additionally it was overpriced for what I received.
