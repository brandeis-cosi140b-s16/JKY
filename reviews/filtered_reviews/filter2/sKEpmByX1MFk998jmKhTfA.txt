I guess when you live in Phoenix and have so many incredible choices for Mexican food you can be a little disappointed every now and then. Cafe Rio at the start was not clear with their menu. Not sure if that is on purpose or just an oversight, but you need to have a starting point for customers. I ordered a chicken burrito and was shocked at the lack of help and suggestions. I didn't know what they had for additions nor was I told. 

Maybe I caught them on an off day, but I think they could do some adjusting to their menu and process.
