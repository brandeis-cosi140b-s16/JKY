China Poblano is such a waste of money. DO NOT COME HERE! As I was walking through Cosmopolitan, I didn't really pay much attention to this little Asian-Mexican joint because it looked like an unappetizing fast food spot, BUT what did catch my eye was Jose Andres' name plastered in front of the restaurant.  I've fallen in love with Jose Andres ever since my enjoyable experience at The Bazzar so I just had to try it.  Of course I knew it wasn't going to be the same, but this just wasn't even good... for any type of standard.  I wanted to try an item from both sides so I opted for the lobster taco and their dan dan mian noodles.  The lobster taco was about $10 and the noodles were around $16?  Both were extremely overpriced for what I got and I honestly don't mind forking out the cash for good food, but this did not even come close.  The portions were extremely small for both, not to mention that my lobster taco was soggy.  The dan dan mian noodles were supposed to be one of their more popular items and I can tell you that there are about a million places in 626 that do it better for about $6.  I regret coming here and should've just gone to Secret Pizza.  China Poblano, how dare you taint Jose Andres' reputation like that!!
