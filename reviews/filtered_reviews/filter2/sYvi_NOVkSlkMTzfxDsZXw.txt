service was really good.
but the meat tasted old. the melons were dry, seemed like they got chopped up 3 days before they brought it to us. after having their dinner felt kinda sick by the time we got to the hotel room. still feel sick right now even though its the next morning. 
i ordered 3 carne-asada tacos and it did not come with guacamole, n when i asked for guacamole they were gonna charge $ 3.00 Extra. real weird.
