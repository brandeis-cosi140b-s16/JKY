Been here twice on separate occasions thinking that my impression would change, but no.  This location specifically is under staffed and it reflects on their dining area which has dirty tables, semi working fountain drink dispensers, and non functioning bathrooms. Food wise, I ordered their chicken salad and my friend had the pork and chicken taco meal and a side of chips and salsa. My salad was pretty bland and the chicken was dry. The pork taco was pretty good according to my friend but the salsa was pretty bland and didn't taste fresh. I think the one on the east side has far better and fresher food and cleaner dining area.
