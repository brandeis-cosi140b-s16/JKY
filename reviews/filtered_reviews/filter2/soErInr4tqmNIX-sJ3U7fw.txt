Don't buy into to the hype! Everything we tried was bad. I did the 3 tacos with a free side. I tried the carne asada, crispy fish, and carnitas taco with a side of pinto beans. My wife had the Beast burrito. The crispy fish was over cooked. The fish was dry and the batter coating was about 2 seconds shy of being burnt. The carne asada was not edible. It was literally nothing but 2 strips of fat and gristle. The carnitas taco was actually braised beef because they brought the wrong one. That was the only decent taco, however.  My wife had the same issue with fat and gristle in her burrito but she did have some edible pieces of meat in there.  The burrito was very wet and soggy, not appealing attributes of a burrito. Not only was the food bad, the tacos were very small for the price. You can go to almost any other restaurant and get a taco twice the size and twice the flavor for half the cost.  There was a comment card left with the bill so my wife filled it out and listed a few of the points listed above.  As we were leaving, my wife stopped by the restroom and I waited outside.  The manager then came out of the restaurant and confronted me with an almost hostile manner said, "so you didn't like the food, huh?"  I explained many of the reasons.  He made excuses and gave me 2 coupons for 3 free tacos each. I already tried half their taco menu and was not impressed with any of them so I doubt we will be back.
