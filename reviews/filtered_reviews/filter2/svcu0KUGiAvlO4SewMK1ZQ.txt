meh.

 I had to shlep over to the new post office just north of McDowell and had read good reviews about this place so I thought I would give a try. 
Used the drive-thru so I can't comment on the cleanliness. Nice tip jar hanging on the drive thru window *eyeroll*. I honestly don't have a problem with tipping. However, do we tip at taco bell? No. Or do we? Yet?
Urg.

The bean and cheese burrito was runny and salty. Their hot sauce was watery and not even close to hot - probably because it was mostly water. I also got their beef taco. My eyes are always bigger than my stomach. One bite and it was actually decent, but I was done, full. I wish I would have eaten the taco first and skipped the bean burrito.
We all know you can't save a taco. It becomes a mushy mess - no ones fault but the nature of the taco.

Los Favoritos has them beat by FAR. If you're a fan of Fiesta Burrito, make the drive to LF and give it a try.

Btw, that new Post Office - clusterfuck.
