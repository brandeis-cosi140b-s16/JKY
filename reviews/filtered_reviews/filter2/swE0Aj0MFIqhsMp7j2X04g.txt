Overpriced for just-okay Mexican. You're paying for being part of the RoRo (Roosevelt Row) scene, such as it is. Skimpy portions. My carne asada torta had hardly any filling. You can get as good or better at most taco.stands. And $7 for guac? Yeah, it was decent guac (if somewhat undermixed) but $7?

My husband asked for flour tortillas for his tacos - big crisis. The only flour tortillas are for the burritos. Can't have them for the tacos as they're too big. Really? Mex place with no flour tortillas for tacos? After much fluttering by the waiter, husband changed order to burrito. Crisis averted.

Our waiter was dumb as a post and running around like a loon, then interrupting and hovering over us while we were talking. GO AWAY UNLESS WE CALL YOU.

We had to yell to place our order and to talk (!) to each other, as the music is cranked up to pick-up-bar levels.

Certainly won't be back.
