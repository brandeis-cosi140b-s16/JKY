As soon as I walked in I was Greeted nicely. The decor and music was Latin and cute made me feel welcomed and at home. They have delicious Mexican wedding cookies in the front like my Tia makes. The horchata was very good! I got the grilled chicken burrito . It comes with rice I had black beans but you do have a choice of the beans you can choose. Sour cream and I added guacamole. The tortillas are hand made thats the best part. Sad to say when I bit into my burrito when I got home it was the most salty burrito ever! Everything else in it was delicious but the chicken was 2 salty that I could not finish it. The salsa was good and chips were okay. Although the owner did tell me if I did not like it he would buy it for me and give me my money back. But I did take it to go otherwise I feel like he would of had my food redone this is the only reason why I am giving this place 2 stars. I am not sure if I will return right now. If the chicken wasn't salty I would of rated this place to 4.5 stars
