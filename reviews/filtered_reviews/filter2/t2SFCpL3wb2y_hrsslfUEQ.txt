My boss chose this spot to have our manager's holiday dinner. I don't know why she picked this spot since none of us live by Red Rock Casino, but whatever. I looked at pictures and read reviews before we arrived so I had my heart set on the guacamole and carne tacos. I'll get to the food in a bit. 

I'm glad the restaurant was right in front of the casino. You park in front and its right there as you enter. We had made reservations prior so it was easy to sit our party of 12. Not like we needed reservations anyway because the restaurant wasn't even busy. Our server was quick to offer us drinks and appetizers while we all chatted and decided what to eat. Here comes the food...

Salsa trio-3 salsas perfect for sharing with the table. Our server was nice enough to bring out all 5 of their salsas (which had unlimited refills). All were decent except for the chipotle salsa. It tasted like plastic to me for some reason. And the other salsas were decent. Nothing really stood out as wow. 
 
Guacamole-pretty average guacamole. I could have made better at home. And $10 for a small serving? Yeah no.

Carne tacos- carne asada tacos topped with a watercress-jicama slaw. The meat was really tough and chewy. Another person at my table also said his carne tacos were tough. The watercress-jicama slaw had no jicama and was very bland. I had to put salsa and guacamole in the taco to make it have some sort of flavor. 

So, for my small plate of guacamole and my 4 tough and flavorless tacos, I ended up paying $28. The price would have been fine had I enjoyed my food. So many other taco spots in town that I'd rather go to and spend way less and be satisfied. Definitely do not recommend this place. Our server was nice and made sure our glasses were never empty, which is why it's a 2 star review instead of 1.
