Overrated food served by friendly staff in a spacious and not too crowded location.

Read that fish tacos was the main attraction, which comes in grilled or Cajun format.  It is healthier, as there are a lot of veggies, but it is dry and relatively bland in taste.

The enchilada (also ordered with Cajun fish) is better, mostly attributed to the homemade spicy verde sauce.

The Wahoo's Salad looks great and the portion is large. Sadly, looking good is not the same as tasting good.

Anyway, glad I came and gave it a try but I have no urge to return for an encore.

Parking: 5/5. Plenty of spaces.

Food:  2/5.  Costco's frozen section probably has better tacos.

Price:  3/5.  $2.55 for a soft taco or enchilada is not bad, but better spent at a local taco stand.

Service:  4/5.  Friendly, especially towards the ladies. 

Food is the main reason for going to restaurants, so Wahoo's may scored high in other attributes, but it was not good enough to earn a repeat visit or recommendation.  Sorry.
