For those of you who do not know. This place serves smaller portions. So you may buy a $13 hot n sour soup and you'll get a bowl. I'm surprised that the fried rice here is $20 and it doesn't have meat. 

I didn't want to eat here cause I got a bad feeling about it. But my friends ordered the hot n sour soup and they ended up returning it because it was too expensive for the price.
