The settings for TNT is really cool. We sat on the outside looking over the first floor of the casino. Service was good. However, the food was poor quality Mexican food. 

Taco chips were cheap and greasy. I had the cheese enchiladas. They were okay but tasted like they were warmed up in a microwave. I also had a margarita but honestly the drinks I had on the casino floor were better and for free. My boyfriend had a steak quesadilla. It was so greasy that it left a big pile of grease on the plate. Although I thought the place was okay he swears to never eat there again. We frequently eat Mexican food. I would not recommend this restaurant if you eat a lot of authentic Mexican food. It is not cheap either.
