Wife and  recently moved to the area and this was the first place we decided to try as aesthetically it jumped out and seemed fun. That much stayed true, the inside has a great vibe, not that large, and had a live musician playing in a little balcony overlooking the restaurant.

Beyond that the experience was the exact 2-Star definition of  'Meh. I've had better'. It took us almost 30 minutes to get seated, and we were hardly even acknowledged by the wait staff. After being seated drinks took another 15 minutes, and food order was another 20 minutes, and 15+ minutes more before the appetizer came out. Speaking of which, the Queso Fundito was the one thing highly raved about here, yet, ours came out as a luke-warm solid mass of cheese--not the dip-able queso we anticipated. In all, from the time we arrived to the time we left took nearly 2 hours.

The entrees were ok, I don't really have complaints there other than it may be a bit pricey for what it was (except my wife's burrito, it was huge and only like $8). However, it's likely nothing impressed me because of how irritated I was with how long everything was taking.

Our server (maybe she was a manager?) was trying really hard and did apologize for the wait on everything. She did mention that there was a party of 20 in there which led to the delays. While I can empathize with this, it didn't seem as if this party put the restaurant over capacity of what a busy friday night might normally be, so they should have been staffed accordingly, not to mention we were sat well after they were so the food orders were plenty staggered.\

Maybe I'll try it again and see if it goes better, we'll see.
