Today, Adovada Ribs, pork dry, the beans taste like they have tomatoe paste in them -no-bueno & covered half of the plate, rice-average, flour tortilla is the winner served with one 10 in flour tortilla additional one for $1.50, red salsa average & green is better. Salsa better at Rosita's on 24th St. & McDowell. One ice tea & one Prickly Pear Margarita good but the salt on rim was fine like table salt. Too bad. Cost for this lunch time meal $28 plus a tip.
