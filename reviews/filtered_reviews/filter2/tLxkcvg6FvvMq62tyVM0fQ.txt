After seeing the 4 star rating and reading the rave reviews about this place I was really excited to try it out but my experience was an utter disappointment. My wife and I had the carne asada tacos and the huarache. The carne asada in the tacos was bland, it didn't have any flavor at all. The huarache tasted a little bit better than the tacos, the carne asada in it had a bit of flavor and the melted cheese and guacamole helped a lot. I think there are much better authentic Mexican restaurants in Madison but this is not one of them.
