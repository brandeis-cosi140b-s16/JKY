What's happened to Secreto???  Used to be a restaurant with high aspirations, and a legacy of the Richardsons New Mexico cuisine and Jamie Santoro cooking -- now half a step from a dive bar nowhere near Flavor Town.  Booths replaced by high-top bar tables, menu with no idea of what it's trying to be (elephant garlic platter as an entree??), and indifferent service that kept us waiting 20 minutes (it was Monday night and there were only 5 tables occupied - what was rushing you so much that you dropped the drink on the table with no eye contact, didn't bring requested water, then delivered soup and main course simultaneously?).  The "tortilla" soup was tasty, though without a actual tortilla in sight, and earns the second star; the rest wasn't poison but was totally lacking in New Mexico seasonings and spices.  With Los Dos across the street I'm afraid there's no reason ever to come back. Adi√≤s, pobrecitos.
