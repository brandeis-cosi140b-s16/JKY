Worst food ever!  I used to eat at los Dos years ago and although their food was spicy..their food was good and margaritas great!  Today....the food was horrible..the margarita was horrible!  OMG!!! Alot if money for horrible food and drink!  The waiter was great!! That was the only redeeming grace!
