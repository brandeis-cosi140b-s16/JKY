If you're looking for good authentic mexican food, Carolina's is the place to be. I recommend going during the day since it's not in the best part of town. I ordered a chimichanga, that was the perfect amount of crispiness and loaded with shredded beef and cheese. It was topped with a generous amount of guacamole & sour cream with refried beans and bland rice on the side. You really can't beat the prices here.
The reason I'm giving it two stars is mostly due to the fact that it's a complete hole in the wall, heck, I wouldn't be surprised if there were actual holes in the walls.
