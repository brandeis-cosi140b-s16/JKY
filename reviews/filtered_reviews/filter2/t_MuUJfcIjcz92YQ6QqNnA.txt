Never returning again. The service was slow, the food wasn't hot, the drinks seemed watered down. Their food wasn't at all tasty. It seemed as though they didn't marinate their flavors together when it came to food. The place is cute, but the lack of attention from their staff, the subpar drinks and the tasteless food will not make me a regular. I put full bar as an option when prompted but they really don't have a full bar since they only have a few top shelf choices.
