Verde is a great place for socializing with friends in a great outdoor atmosphere over decent, but pricey food. In the summer, the restaurant opens its garage-door wall to the warm air and puts out tables and chairs on the patio--sit here, but prepare to wait if you come on a Friday evening. The food is decent--my pollo asado (roasted chicken) with yuca fries were good but not great (for ~$18 there was a little too much chicken). The white sangria with ginger is refreshing, but very pricey ($23 for a pitcher). The Mexican food is not the best in PGH and the vegetarian entrees DO disappoint. Overall, a nice experience if you're willing to pay.
