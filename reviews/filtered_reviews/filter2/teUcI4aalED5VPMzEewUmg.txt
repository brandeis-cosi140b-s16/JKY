Expensive. Ordered lamb medium rare, and got it rare/blue was still good, center was cold. Filet was ordered rare but arrived medium/well, waiter was curt and disagreed that my steaming hot brown and light pink meat was actually rare, um no. 

The meat was dried out and there was no blood in sight. They fixed it but no apologies. Pork tenderloin was dried out. Veggies were fantastic. Could be more friendly, especially when you drop $140 on two people.
