I use to really like this place,  food is authentic even though the service usually sucks.  Tonight was especially bad, we came in at 8:30, and we stood at the register waiting to be seated for 10 minutes,  and that's not an exaggeration...not because it was super slammed but because the one waitress who was working just didn't care.  Almost every table was filthy and that should have been a sign to leave.  

We literally waited 30 minutes for our meal,  and to say it was warm is being kind. My taco was soggy which meant it probably sat in the window. The waitress NEVER came back to check on us...so my meal just sat there because I'm not eating at this point cold mexican food and taking a chance of getting sick.  

In conclusion,  this place is going on the NO GO list of places not to eat at anymore.
