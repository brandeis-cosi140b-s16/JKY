I've been weeknight drinking here before and was pleased with the draft selection, but recently I went for food and wished I hadn't.

The chips were stale and chewy, but at least the salsa was okay. Most places don't know how to prepare fresh and flavorful vegetarian food, so I wasn't completely surprised when I got the tofu tacos and couldn't taste anything but the salted "sweet" corn. The tofu was cold, the lettuce was warm, and the avocado "sauce" didn't taste like anything at all. 

This is not the way anyone should spend National Taco Day. I'm going to need a do-over for sure.
