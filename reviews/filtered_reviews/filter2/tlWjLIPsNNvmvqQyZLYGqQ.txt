I have been here twice before and enjoyed it and have even recommended it to friends.   I'm not sure what was going on today, but the food was bland and the service was so slow. I didn't pick up on this before, but the menu is way overpriced for the food you get. A boring bean burrito is 9 dollars! I have had better off the dollar menu at Taco Bell - I don't even like Taco Bell!  I won't be visiting this location again.
