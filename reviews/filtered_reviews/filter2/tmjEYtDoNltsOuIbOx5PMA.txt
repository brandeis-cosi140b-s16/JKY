I have eaten at arriba several times over the last few years and its usually the same.first of all,I don't know how the hostess even still has a job.she's rude,never smiles or says hello when you walk in.she just looks you up and down and says "how many?" In a monotone voice.when its always just me and my boyfriend.what are you blind?then she always no matter what, manages to seat you directly next to the table with screaming kids and babies even when the restaraunt is empty.and she always picks the smallest most cramped 2seater in the house.I understand if it's busy that it's her job to seat according to the flow of the restaraunt,but even when it's dead she does this.we have to ask to switch tables everytime we go there.and no,I have never done anything to piss her off.don't even know her.I just recognize her cuz she's been there forever.anyhow the food is usually pretty good.the bean dip is excellent.the service usually always sucks though.you have to wait forever for drinks and refills even when its not busy.I did actually have 2 good severs there once and was impressed,but usually when I go,I expect bad service.there's even worse service at the bar.I've actually have sat down,got ignored and had to say "hey can I get a drink"again,it was not busy,so no excuse.the bartenders always too busy watching t.v. to acknowledge you.also,most of the servers look like heroin junkies.no lie,missing teeth and everything.no wonder the turnover rate is so high.but I will say the foods not bad.
