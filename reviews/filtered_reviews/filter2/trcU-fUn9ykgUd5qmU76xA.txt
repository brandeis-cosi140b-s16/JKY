Far from being good Mexican food. The rice has no flavor, tastes like plastic. The only thing that has good taste are the chips because both the salsa and the homemade beans are bland. We had a really nice server but he only stopped to see if we needed anything else hmmm...0 times! I did like how they bring you a mini pitcher for your beverage refills. Overall I thought I was way too expensive for the bland food that doesn't even deserve to be called a Mexican Restaurant.
