We were SO excited about their opening! We had read all about the Manhattan Beach location and had high hopes. Unfortunately, management made the call to open way too early. Servers were not trained at all nor well versed in the menu. Our order came out wrong and had to be sent back. Like other reviewers mentioned, at $18-24 a plate portions are on the small side and with no side dishes included...the prices are exorbitant! The food was average at best. Sad because we were looking for something outstanding.
