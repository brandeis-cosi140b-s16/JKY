I have been to Barrio Queen three times. The food has been consistently great, but it is always overshadowed by the terrible service. Everything from waiting more than an hour for a table after an estimated 25 minute wait to drink orders being lost to half of our food order being lost (how does that happen?).  But my favorite was when this Mexican restaurant ran out of sangria, carnitas, and chips ... yes, chips.  Three strikes. It will take a lot to get me back there.
