I haaaate being the guy that gives a 2 star review for something people are crazy about.  I've been actively wanting to try El Pollo Supremo for about 2 months now, and finally got around to it this afternoon, and was quite let down. 
First, I was a bit taken aback by the price..
Nearly $12 for a quartered chicken, and nearly $15 (yes.. Fifteen!) for around 12 oz of carne asada (each come with boring beans and some 3rd party tortillas. Also.. salsa that could be jarred by Gerber).. 
Once I got home with the goods, and saw the portion sizes, my skepticism grew stronger, and for good reason.... 
SALTY. Incredibly salty. Toxic saltiness. I'm not a wuss either.. if something has unhealthy levels of anything in it, I'm usually a huge fan. This was not enjoyable. Then came the Carne Asada.. far less salty than the chicken, but still pretty intense... it was OK. I've had worse carne asada.. but I've also had way better. It really needed some good fresh pico de gallo to kinda crisp up the otherwise gummy meat... This is the first time I feel that yelp has steered me wrong... not bad, considering how many WIN places I've found otherwise :)
****Also- looking at the picture of the menu, their combo prices seem to be a MUCH better value than just purchasing full chickens, or full orders of Carne asada!
