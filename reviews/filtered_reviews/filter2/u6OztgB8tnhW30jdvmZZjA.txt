I've eaten here a handful of times with friends and with my husband. Every time I have ended up with a waiter that was not friendly or even seemed happy with his job. The last time I ate at this restaurant the waiter was just plain rude when I asked about something on the menu.  Other then the bad customer service the food is just ok.
