I went here once for lunch and was really disappointed. Boyfriend and I shared the fajitas, which were $18. The iron skillet on which it was served was incredibly small and I think we got three skimpy tacos out of it. They tasted okay--Chili's fajitas are better, I think. The margaritas are okay, a bit too much mixer and not as smooth as I like.

I think $4 for a Corona is a a bit much when you're a Mexican inspired Cantina, but then again, maybe as a lunch customer they were making money off of us in exchange for this awesome happy hour I hear about. 

Speaking of,  I'd give this place another shot if it was during happy hour. It is loud and packed when I pass by it, so I wonder if they'd have room? Take this review with a grain of salt--I think my expectations are misaligned for the location and the patrons.
