We are here for spring training. The Potstickers are like a routine out at first , but the runner on third scored with the play. The pork enchilada was soo dry I gave up & spit it out. Think pork jerky. Strikeout there. The thing I liked best, other then the fun decor, was the black beans. Which says alot.
