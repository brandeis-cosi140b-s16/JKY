The drinks and atmosphere are great. Service wasn't bad either. Very friendly staff. Beautiful decor and clean restaurant. The food on the other hand ... I was not a fan. Maybe I'm spoiled coming from Houston but I thought it was well below average. Cheese dip was way too thick. Too much sour cream. Salsa tasted like straight tomato paste. And our fajita meat was way overdone. Maybe it was just a bad night in the kitchen. Don't think I'll be giving it another try though.
