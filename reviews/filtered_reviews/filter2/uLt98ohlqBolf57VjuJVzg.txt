My recent visit to Border Grill was not as positive as my previous visits. My first review was based on a few trips to the establishment, which were great experiences. Since then, they have remodeled and things within have changed. In my first review I mentioned that the service could use a little improvement. The service in my opinion has taken a step forward. The food didn't taste the same.

This establishment has changed. What I used to, widely regard as the best Mexican food I've ever had, no longer is. The service takes a step forward while the food takes a step back. The skirt steak, still tender but was a little saltier than I remember, smaller portion of steak too. I had the citrus chicken burrito, which my waiter recommended as the best item on the menu. It wasn't the best item!!! The fish tacos are still the best item they have to offer. Which I had a little bit of. The beer battered chicken strips, was terrible for the kids menu.

I'm very upset with my latest experience at the Border Grill. I can't say I would go back, next time I'm in vegas. The experience was very unsatisfying. Adding brunch menu probably not the best idea.
