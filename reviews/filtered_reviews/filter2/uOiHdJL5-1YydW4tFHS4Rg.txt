Review from my 12yo son:

We went here with a large group of about 17 people. The service was slow and we ran out of water several times. I ordered the queso fundido and it was cooked well but it was too cheesy for me. I would go back again but I would order something else. 

One of the kids that we were there with has special needs and the waiter never brought him his order and he didn't tell anyone so he left without eating even though his mom paid for his quesadilla!

The bathrooms were fairly clean and the duck pond is fun. You can feed the ducks, turtles and fish if you put quarters in the duck food machine.

I would go back again but I'd rather go to Taco Bell.
