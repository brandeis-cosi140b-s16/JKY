I don't know any restaurant that has the price tag of Sumo Maya and with worst service. Our waiter was very colloquial with us, to the point it was rude. He was not helpful and didn't explain what the Mexican Pho is. The music was too loud considering we were the only people eating. And the staff were all having lunch spread out around the restaurant. The Mexican pho was fantastic besides a few pieces of chewy poor quality chicken and the sushi chef was willing to change around some of the Rock Shrimp Roll for my mother. However, we will not be coming back for lunch any time soon.
