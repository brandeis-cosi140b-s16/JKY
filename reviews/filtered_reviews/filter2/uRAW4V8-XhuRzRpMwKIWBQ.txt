I wanted to love this place since it's one of the only Mexican restaurants within walking distance of Fremont.  But the food was just run of the mill.  Nothing amazing.  

Tamales were 3 stars.  Everything else I've tried on the menu (enchiladas, tacos and burrito) drags the place down to two stars.  If it weren't in the run down part of downtown, I'm not sure Dona Maria's would still be around.
