We decided to take a chance since we were staying nearby and the concept seemed cool. Whoops. Mistake. The dim sum was gross. The noodle soup was ok. the "Mexican" entrees were just plain weird. None of it tasted great. Service was good and attentive although the flow of food from the two separate kitchens was not well synchronized. Oh, and I concur with the other reviews, the bench seating is a bit uncomfortable, it may be trendy to have the seating that way but I'll take a good old chair with a back any day! Spent 100 bucks, left hungry and baffled.
