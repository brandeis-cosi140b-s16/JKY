Great  atmosphere, drinks we decent, and food is good. However, this place is ridiculously overpriced. There's no way I would ever pay $17 for the small amount of fajitas I received, and they were basic fajitas. The drinks are $11-$14 which is ridiculous too. Nice place and decent food but way overpriced.
