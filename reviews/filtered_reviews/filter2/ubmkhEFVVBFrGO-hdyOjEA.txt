Wahoo's is your typical american-Mexican place, which I usually do not have a problem with as long as the flavors are there.  Unfortunately, thats not the case here. The atmosphere is hip and pretty laid back, however, the food is pretty mediocre. Wahoos has nothing on cafe rio! They do have a bar are which is usually pretty fun with an outside patio so its not like most Mexican restaurants. I would recommend the place for happy hour drinks but not necessarily for the food!
