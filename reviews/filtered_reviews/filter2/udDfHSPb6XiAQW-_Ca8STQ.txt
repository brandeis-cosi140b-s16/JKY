Be sure to look at your bill. I have eaten here 3 times and had a poor experience each time. I will not be back. 

This last time, I saw that it was Happy Hour and asked, "Is it Happy Hour". 

The bartender said, " Yes it is."

"Premium Wells are $4," I said. "Do you have cherry vodka."

"Yes" 

"I'll have a cherry vodka and Sprite."

When the bill came, my drink was $7. The bartender said that Sky Cherry Vodka is not a "premium well". 

You do the math on that one. I'll just stay away from Modern Margarita.

P.S. You should not expect substitutions or dietary restrictions to be fulfilled. I think the wait staff forgets their own name when they walk away from your table.
