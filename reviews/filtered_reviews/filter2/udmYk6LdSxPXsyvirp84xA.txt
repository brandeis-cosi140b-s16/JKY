I was in Yolos on December 26th with family.
We reserved the table. When we came they offered us the table behind the column. When I was trying to ask if we can have the table next to that(the place was almost empty), the answer was: the table is reserved and we already attached every table to exact reservation(what a bunch of b..?!) Finally we got another table, after I said that I did reserve the table too. 
And when the waitress was taking the order, we tried to translate her questions about rice preferences to our guests from Russia, she heard it and was trying to get away impatiently("you need the time, I'll come later"). What kind of service is that??
And than I saw that she brought the wrong check to the  table next to us! People were really disappointed!
After we had the food, we were sitting for a while talking, and NO ONE cleaned the table full of plates for 30 min after we finished eating!!! She had asked if she can take the plates, but she didn't!!  We paid the check, she returned for it, and still didn't try to clean the table!?! 
What the f.. service is that???

By the way, the food itself was good;)))) but the waitress... I'll never come back!
