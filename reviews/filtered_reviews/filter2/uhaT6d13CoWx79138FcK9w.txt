Don't expect to have any conversation with your fellow diners. So loud in there. Made me wonder- is this place a nightclub or is it a restaurant?  Fine either way but owners should make it one or the other 

Food is nothing to write home about. Fish tacos were greasy and carnitas had chunks of fat in them. Salsa and ceviche were very good. 

Speaking of salsa. If you want it you have to pay for it. What decent Mexican restaurant out there charges for chips and salsa?  Beans and rice are also a la carte and are not included with your meal. 

If you are looking for a fun loud nightclub I recommend this place. Don't go there expecting a memorable dining experience.
