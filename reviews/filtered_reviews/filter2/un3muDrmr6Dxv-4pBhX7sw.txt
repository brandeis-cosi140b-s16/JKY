I got the Torta Mexicana and a lime agua frescas. I must have made the wrong choice in torta because it was pretty boring - the meat wasn't really seasoned, the avocado was just lumped on instead of spread evenly, and there were no beans like the menu says. I got it without jalape√±o so maybe that would have made the difference but overall, I was pretty disappointed. Also, it was just the torta (only slightly larger than your average fast food burger) and a side of radish and cucumbers (???) that I didn't want and some cabbage/lettuce mix I put on my burger myself for over $7.

However, the agua frescas was DELICIOUS.

I would come back and try to make a better choice but overall, a pretty disappointing experience that left me unsatisfied and $12.50 poorer. You've steered me wrong, Man vs. Food guy.
