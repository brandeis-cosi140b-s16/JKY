So when I heard my brother's friends birthday would be here, I was a little skeptical. First, I had never heard of it and second I started to research it on Yelp. I was apprehensive after reading the reviews and was worried I would be wasting my money on sub-par food. Well after going, it was not horrible, but not a life changing experience either. 

I was saddened when i found out it had replaced Tanneko. I actually liked that place. We had reservations because we were a big party, so we didn't wait long. There were, however, quite a few people waiting for a while after we sat down. It was your typical north Scottsdale crowd. Every woman looked the same and every guy looked like a DB. 

The food. I enjoyed the chips and salsa. It's hard to mess up. Had a couple of Dos Equis which they had on tap. They came out promptly and cold. I ordered the Carnitas tacos. They came with rice and beans. There were two tacos and you have a choice of tortilla. They were pretty good. Again, nothing spectacular. The black beans I had were good, but the rice was just like buttered white rice that someone mentioned in a previous review. My brother had the machaca burrito which was huge and he seemed to enjoy. 

A couple of funny anecdotes. I think we had runners bring food for other tables to ours about 3 times. They seemed a little lost all night. Later on when the right food came, my brother asked the runner which of the two identical burritos was chicken and which was beef. The runner said, and I quote, "Dude, they just give me the food and tell me where to take it." No effing joke! 

Overall, you could probably skip this place and come back when it changes to some other ethnic-type food place in a year.
