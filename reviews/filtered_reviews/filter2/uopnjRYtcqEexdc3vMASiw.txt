Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but my carne asada burrito "with everything" was just OK. I definitely feel that I've had better. 

Am I just spoiled from living in LA? 

The burrito was a good size and the components were good, but it was definitely missing freshness. I had to drown the burrito with the squeeze bottle salsa verde to bring acidity and more flavor to it. 

Where was the cilantro and onions? Those pickled radishes? This location doesn't even have a salsa bar where you can get these things if you wanted to. I've literally never been to a Mexican restaurant where there's only one salsa available; there's always salsa verde, roja, and usually pico de gallo available, but apparently that's not the case here.  

I'm glad to say that the service is a worlds apart from the places I go to in LA; they're actually very nice here! But the food just seemed a little one-note and flat to me.
