I know I'm in the minority here, but this place just wasn't that good.  The service was slow, the food was sub par and there really isn't a reason for me to go back.

I went here with some family and tired a few different things on the menu and wasn't impressed.  The tamales were bland, the tacos were cold and the salad not impressive.  

In a city with lots of good Mexican food, I see no reason to eat here.
