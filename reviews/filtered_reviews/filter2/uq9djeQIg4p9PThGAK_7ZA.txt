Wahoos would be a good spot for cheap drinks and socializing but do not come for the food.  It is very dissapointing.  

The chips, salsa and guac were A-OK.  Everything else - MEH.

The prices are reasonable, especially for alcohol.  On this particular day, wine was 1/2 off so you could get a glass for $2.50.  Pacificos were $1-$2.  

I ordered the Baja-ladas (essentially a spin on enchiladas).  When I think of enchiladas, I salivate in anticipation for something piping hot with molten cheese and flavorful sauce.  I got a cold chicken wrap topped with luke warm sauce, filled with raw spinach.  Big boo.  Literally, the inside was cold, and raw.  Not good.  The rice and beans lacked pizazz as well.  All in all, a dissapointment.  

Hubby got fish tacos.  They were OK at best.  Certainly nothing to name a restaurant after.  

The service was very nice and friendly; alas, we won't return.
