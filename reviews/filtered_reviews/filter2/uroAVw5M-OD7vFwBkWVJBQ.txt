No matter what you order the salsa and hot sauce aren't good.  The hot sauce is just not good. The salsa tastes like they added vinegar to preserve it. Otherwise, it might be good if they made it fresh and more often. I've lived in Az over 50 years.There are only a few things that a mexican restaurant needs to get right, sauce is one of them.
