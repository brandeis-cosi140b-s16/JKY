I was excited to take a few friends here that are big fans of New Mexican Cuisine. I ordered my standard, a Grilled Chicken  Chimmichanga with Green chile, no beans and extra rice. Not being a fan of re fried beans I was disappointed and shocked when my Chimmi arrives and it's filled with chicken and beans. 
I spoke to a man who must have been the owner/manager and told him I'd been here many times before and it never had beans in it.  He told me they always come with beans and I must have ordered something different on my prior visits. Not true, I always order the grilled chicken and it's NEVER  had beans in it. It was getting close to an argument and figured I'd take the higher road since he reluctantly agreed to replace the meal.
Food comes out and it's as good as ever. The manager/owner comes back over to my table to ask if everything was ok and I responded with a smile and yes. I guess he felt it was necessary to once again explain to me that I had ordered incorrectly and to make sure I specify that I didn't want re fried beans. 
 I politely explained  that I had, that on my previous 5 visits it NEVER had beans and pointed out to him that  nowhere on his menu did it say that beans were standard filling. 

Just a quick message to ownership. The food at your restaurant is outstanding, as good as I've found throughout the valley but the attitude I experienced today really makes me not want to return. 

5 stars for the food and 1 for the service.
