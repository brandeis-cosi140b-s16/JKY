Came here for my moms 50.

Drinks: ordered the papa chulo margarita that had resporado tequila, it was good but not as strong. The waiter was great in adding in another shot! The mojito was also good.

The food was not great for most of the table. For myself, the vegetarian fajita was great! I really wish they had yellow corn tortilla. My sister ordered the chile relleno and a vegetarian enchilada and absolutely hated the taste, since the sauce was cold and rice lacked flavor. My husbands ordered was messed up by the person delivering the food. (Not our main waiter) who nicely and promptly fixed the ordered. The chicken fajita were ok, brother thought it lacked flavor and the cheese enchiladas were just overly stuffed with cheese. 

Overall, the only reason I would go is the chips and salsa were good and the waiter was very very accommodating and prompt! Wish I knew his name! Otherwise this place needs to pick up their food quality and service for the people delivering the food!
