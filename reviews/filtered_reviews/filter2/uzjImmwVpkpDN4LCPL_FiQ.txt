Decent food (had the breakfast burrito, which was delightfully pressed on the grill and crispy), great location, but some of the worst live music I've ever heard in my life, right up there with some wedding reception noise!  The restaurant was full and ONE person, an employee who seemed to be the singer's girlfriend, applauded.  Dead silence from everyone else.  For several songs.  It was really bad.  I actually had the waiter change my order to takeout, but thankfully the "musician" packed up soon after that.  The poor server apologized, and said they're working on the noise level, but I think they need to look at the talent level instead.  If I hear/see that awful LOUD caterwauling they call live entertainment again when I enter here, I will immediately turn around and leave.

This experience was actually from my second time in the restaurant.  My first time I walked in I was ignored, there was no one at the hostess stand area, and there was a bored looking waitress rolling silverware and pretending I wasn't looking at the menus.  I walked out after a bit.

Two strikes means I've yet to go back, since Los Tacquitos on 16th Street and Glendale is just as close, much faster, and the women working there (owners?) give great customer service.  Their quality probably isn't as high as Otro, but neither are their prices.
