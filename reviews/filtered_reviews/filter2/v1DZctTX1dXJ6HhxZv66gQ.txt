Sunday Funday Part 2. I'm a huge fan of downtown Gilbert and love that new places are popping up. My 2nd trip the the Barrio and my girlfriends 4th.  We sat down at the bar as usual. Slow afternoon, only a few tables filled and 4 other people at the bar. We both ordered a Modelo Especial on draft......so good. But I like a shot of silver tequila with my mexican beer, and going through the menu there isn't a shot under $8. I get the up sell part when our bartender tells me the reposado is better.......I get it. She then offered me an orange slice with cinnamon, and I politely declined. I like my silver tequila and my beer. WELL THATS THE MOST TRADITIONAL WAY TO DRINK TEQUILA........whoa whoa whoa.....settle down blondie.....your hair pulled back a little tight?  She must of took offense to my polite decline, because we had to ask 3 times for chips and salsa. Then we had the pleasure of listening to her bitch about her shifts for the next 10 minutes. 
AGAIN, I didn't get anything to eat, our bartender had a resting bitch face and made it very unpleasant to sit at the bar. Didn't like the vibe at all. I had a good experience here and a bad, I will give Barrio one more chance on our next Sunday out. Hopefully it'll be better.
