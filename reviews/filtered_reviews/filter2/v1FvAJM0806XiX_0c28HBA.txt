I had the scallop quesadilla which was like eating a salt lick. Dining partner had the green corn tamales which had a really pungent cheese which made them unpleasant to eat. The beans on the side were cooked in red wine with a spicy sauce which was bitter and spicy, a particularly bad combo. Given the price of 12-15$ per plate more palatable fair should be the standard. Secreto has a nice atmosphere and great decor so I'm giving a second try in the future but I find it fishy that 2/3rds of the entree menu is steaks and pasta when this is suppose to be a New Mexican restaurant.
