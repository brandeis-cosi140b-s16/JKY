The Good:
+  Great service!  Really friendly staff and bartenders will help you pass the time.
+  Extensive menu for an airport.  

The Not So Good:
-  The food was not good.  My chorizo was burnt to a char and it was supposed to be the star of the dish.  The redeeming factor was the sunny side up eggs.
-  Incredibly expensive for what you get.  We get it, it's an airport.  But when you're paying close to 15 dollars for a plate of two basic eggs you're getting shafted.
-  Slow service for food, quick service for drinks.
