The scuttlebutt around the 'hood was that this place is a great new addition, so I thought I'd try it out for taco Tuesday. 
The deal is this: $1.75 street tacos & $1 off a salsa flight & drinks. The kicker is that the drinks are expensive to start with. A Corona for $5.75 ref price & $5 oh happy hour - in this town! You've got to be joking! The margarita was bland & sour, I couldn't drink it. My exchange was handled with grace by the bartender, so kudos there. 
I got a round of their tacos, four. 
Pollo asado: very dry meat, all white though if that appeals & bland. 
Short ribs: not bad, also a bit dry. 
Braised pork: finally a tender meat! Subtle but nice seasoning. 
Octopus: the winner, well seasoned & tender , with the natural flavor coming through :) something that is actually quite difficult to obtain. 

The skinny: Bland overpriced food & drink attempting to play to the CenPho crowd & thinks it's achieving through decor. Clearly a gringo trap.
