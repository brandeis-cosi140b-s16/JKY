Our family is three generations of Carolina's Fans!!!  While the food is generally some of the best casual Mexican in Phoenix, last night was not their night.  They are open until 8:30 pm and we rolled in about 7:50, plenty time right?  We ordered, sat down and they are sweeping the floors right next to our food!  The young girl didn't care one bit customers were in there, stirring up trash, germs and who knows what from peoples shoes.  Back to the food...the taco was cold and my husband's combo burrito had so much steam table juice it was soaked!!  Carolina's please check your evening staff out as they ARE NOT doing your name justice...  Our visit was yesterday, March 25th...
