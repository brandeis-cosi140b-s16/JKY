A bit pricey for Mexican food. I did enjoy their salsa and bean dip. I had ordered a burrito with rice and beans, with a soda. My tab came up to about $21. Again a bit pricey, but I did enjoy the meal I had with my 2 other girlfriends. 

Would I come back here, sure why not, if I'm going for an occasion. 

But if I wanted to get my Mexican-food fix...I'd rather go to Filiberto's or some other place.
