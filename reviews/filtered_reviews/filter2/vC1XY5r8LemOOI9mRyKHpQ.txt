My husband was having some Mexican cravings one night, and as we always try to do to try a new place, we decided to try Los Sombreros which is only a few miles from home. As we pulled in the parking lot, we were surprised how packed the lot is so we thought this was a good choice. At the reception area, we got greeted and seated right away. Service is quite good as glasses with water and menu were handed as we take our seats. A basket of freshly made chips with mild salsa was served as we take time finding a good meal to choose. As we scan the two-page menu, we found the selection to be minimal and somewhat overpriced with only a few items costing to at least less than $10 and the rest within the range of $10-20. The chips and salsa were good enough that we asked for another serving without knowing that this will be charged, it was actually on the menu that per refill costs. Not a good thing I guess. We decided on Simmered pork in a pumpkinseed tomatillo mole sauce, presentation is nice but nothing really special as we take bites of it. It's an entree that comes with choices of refried beans, black beans, rice or vegetables and tortilla. The only thing that made my husband happy with the meal was the hot salsa that really made him sweat like he has never sweat before from eating hot salsa! 

Overall, the experience didn't leave us happy and will not try to come back here again though I would rate the ambiance and decor high as it is inviting and homey.
