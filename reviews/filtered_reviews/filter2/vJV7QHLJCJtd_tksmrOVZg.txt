I would only recommend this place for the drinks! I find it odd that a Mexican food place doesn't sell chips and salsa or beans! The main side for food is fries!!! It's really weird! I think they should rethink their menu!' For this reason I give them 2 stars!

I had a chicken spinach salad and it was decent!
