Nothing too special here. It's a great spot. Looks nice inside but it's so loud we could barely hear each other talk (may be just where we were sitting) Salsa was good and so was creamy jalepeno,  Tuesdays happy hour special was Margaritas which was a bonus but they were just OK, not too impressed with my shrimp tacos either, should be grilled and not fried. I had higher hopes for Chuys, have definitely had better and is nothing to write home about.
