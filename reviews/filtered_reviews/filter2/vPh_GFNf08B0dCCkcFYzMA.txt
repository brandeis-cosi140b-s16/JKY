I've been going to this location for years and had excellent service fast and efficient until today! The manager, Brie was very disrespectful and rude to her guests. She was at the register talking with her coworker when I so rudely interrupted her conversation to pay for my food. She continued to mutter words of disgust under her breath. Unfortunately I won't be giving this location my business any longer.
