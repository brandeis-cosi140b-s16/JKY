The yard long Miami vice was good. Everything after that was not good. I got fish tacos and the sauce was way too overpowering for the delicate fish. Also came with no sides (for $18 I should get at least chips!!). BFF got chicken burrito which tasted okay but he said he got sick later. My boss got nachos and they looked awful. The cheese wasn't melted all the way. 

Nothing was so bad I couldn't eat it... Just nothing tasted good either. Still probably one of the best spots in TI... Which is actually kinda sad.
