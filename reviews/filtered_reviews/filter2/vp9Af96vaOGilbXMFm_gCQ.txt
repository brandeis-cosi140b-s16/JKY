I was hoping this location would finally put together a good Mexican restaurant.  Unfortunately, it might be worse than Lolita's.  The place is like a beach bar in mexico that impersonates a restaurant before 10 pm.  Our waitress was really nice but that's about it.  Chips and salsa cost 5.00 (chips were cold and semi-stale). We asked for queso cheese and were presented with a bowl of lukewarm liquid cheese.  Fish tacos were ok.  

I sure hope they kill it as a nightclub because this place will die the same death Lolita's did if not.  I really hope they figure it out.
