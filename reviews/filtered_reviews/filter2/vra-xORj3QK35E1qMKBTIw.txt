I have to agree with a number of other Yelpers who have commented that the food is rather lackluster at Two Hippies.

The restaurant itself is very cool...stepping inside to order and waiting on the side porch and or back porch for your food is for a moment like being transported to Venice Beach or Mission Beach in Cali.

But alas visions of California soon recede (and you snap back to the the fact that...damn...I am still in Phoenix) once you eat the food here. The portions for the taco's and burros are large but oh so bland.

I had to drench a vegetarian burro I ordered with green sauce to get any flavor and even then it was still a bland meal.

There are much better taco and burrito shops in downtown Phoenix  (La Condesa Taco Shop is best I have been at in Phoenix so far...have to do a review soon) so look around and don't get sucked into Two Hippies just for the scenery.
