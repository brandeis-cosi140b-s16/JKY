We came with a group of 8, including two young children.  The staff was very attentive and efficient.  The food, meh.  It wasn't awful, but definitely not great.  The drinks were mediocre, too.  It worked out okay for a larger party without a wait, but I'd choose another spot if we weren't thinking about the kids being served quickly.
