I wanted to love this place. The atmosphere is good, the prices are good, and the food is edible, but I've had too many problems. I've been there three times and there has been a problem every time.

The first time I went, they overcharged for a menu item. When asked about it, they said they updated the prices but didn't update the menu, and pointed to a small sticker on the menu stating that "prices are subject to change." They ended up fixing the price without an issue. The second time I went, they forgot to put alcohol in the margarita. They ended up replacing the drink without an issue. The third time I went, they overcharged us for drinks at the bar by about 10 bucks. I didn't bring it up. I paid and left. I won't be returning.
