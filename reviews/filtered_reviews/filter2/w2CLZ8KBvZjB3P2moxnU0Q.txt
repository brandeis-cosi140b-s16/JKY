I came to Phoenix on a business trip and the first night I went to blanco I was blown away.  My bartender,  Travis, was extremely knowledgeable about the product and I was able to try tequila in a way I never had before.  The service was outstanding, the tequila was outstanding and the overall experience was great.

The reason I am giving this place two stars is because of the experience I just left there with.  I don't even know the name of my bartender because he didn't introduce himself.  When I asked him for the $20 tequila that I had the first night I went he told me that "oh we don't even have that, I know it's on the menu but it's at [a different place]"  I was ordering an ultra, top shelf tequila, and he offered instead a patr√≥n. .. standard drunk college tequila. I asked again.  Are you sure you don't have the El Tesoro "paradiso".  He eventually found it.  Long story short.  I sat at the bar with an empty beer and an empty tequila after only one glass of each, ready to spend money, disappointed that my last night in Phoenix was hosted by a bartender who was too interested in the cute girl next to me (not that I blame him too much but she worked there) I left un attended to and disappointed in a restaurant that I thought was a real diamond in the rough.
