Ok.....I go to the Sandbar quite a bit. I went today and I could not believe how loud it was. Being a sports bar, I get that it will be loud. This was a different kind of loud. I could not hear my husband sitting 12 inches away from me. Even my teen kids were holding their ears. It was seriously WAY TOO LOUD. My ears were ringing when I left. I ordered the mexican pizza that cost me $10 and was literally a burned tortilla with beans, meat and lettuce. That was it. The server was great, but she had a hard time hearing our orders HENCE it was too loud. I don't think I will ever go back. Bummer, because I live so close and it could be a really fun place.
