Not sure about all the hubbub.   The samples were nice but the food didn't do anything special for me.   The cookies at the end were delightful.   

I'm not sure that Chinese and Mexican belong together.   My husband liked the relleno but wasn't wild about it.    

The people were all incredibly nice hence 2 stars.
