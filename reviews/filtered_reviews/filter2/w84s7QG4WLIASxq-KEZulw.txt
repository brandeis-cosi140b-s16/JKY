I haven't even eaten here yet & at this point, not sure if I want to. I called to make reservations for 7. They don't take reservations (pet peeve #1). A friend called closer to our scheduled dinner time to find out if there was call ahead seating. The snippy person on the other line said "we don't take reservations or call ahead seating. The current wait time is 25-30min & it will get longer the longer you wait and btw we won't seat your party until everyone is here." Well Leticia's you might be loosing out on business from 7 paying customers.
