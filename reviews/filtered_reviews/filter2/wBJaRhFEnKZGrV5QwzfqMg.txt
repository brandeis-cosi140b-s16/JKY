The whole restaurant felt very muggy and humid, a little smelly. After 15-20 minutes of being seated, we still hadn't had anyone come take our drink order. We ended up having to ask another waiter if someone would be serving us. Then they forgot to put tequila in the margarita I ordered, so I returned it for a new one, which tasted pretty gross. Bottomless chips and salsa was good, but that's the only positive thing I can say. Just an all around bummer -- not impressed.
