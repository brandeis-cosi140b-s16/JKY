This is my 4th visit to this restaurant.  My first visit in August I was impressed with the presentation of the food that is why we bring guests here.  We always order the Para La Mesa, which comes with mini cast iron container where they put the sides of rice, beans, corn and including the mini tortillas in cast iron with lid which kept it warm.  We have guests again and we brought them here last Wednesday.  I thought it would impress them.  
Here's what happened, we got an attitude from waitress because our guests asked questions, I think she didn't like that.  A waiter/waitress should explain to new customers; however in the end she kinda back down a little bit.  And going back to the food presentation, it's not the mini cast iron anymore, but we got the sides in those ugly soup cup and although they give mini tortillas they put it in a stainless steel can and you have to eat the tortillas right away otherwise it gets cold.  Since the food is good for 4 people, which they also gave us 4 mini tortillas we requested for more tortillas versus the big amount of meat.  When the tortillas came they gave us corn instead of flour.  We didn't return it as everyone was hungry and cannot wait anymore, we ate what we have.  Also, I cannot understand that this restaurant doesn't even have butter or should I say "mantiquilla."  The last time I was there they gave it to me!!!  

Management, please don't change anything, otherwise, you'll lose customers like us!!!  Leave the mini cast iron for sides and to keep the tortillas warm, ensure that your waiters/waitress explain to new customers that the chips & salsa are separate not included in the meal, these little things that captivate me most, food presentation, quality of food, and awesome service!!!
