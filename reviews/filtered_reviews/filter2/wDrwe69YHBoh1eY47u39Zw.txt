Yesterday, a bunch of us came to El Torito to cure our hangover.  As you go up Boulder Hwy, make sure you are paying attention, because you will miss this place if you don't.  Talk about a po-dunk humble establishment LOL.

When I walked in, I felt like I wasn't in Vegas anymore.  This place reminded me of some truck stop diner you see on the movies.  We were told to just take a seat somewhere, so we took the booth in the back corner.  A lot of things in this place is dusty.  This place is old.  Dirty forks, long wait.  I mean REALLY long wait.  There were two servers and they seemed all over the place.  

I got the #4 on the breakfast menu for about $8.00.  It was a hamburger patty, eggs, hash brown and toast.  The hamburger patty was so dry I had to smother ketchup on it.  The eggs were done over easy and helped bring some moisture to the burger patty.  The hashbrowns were nicely brown and crispy and the butter came with a side of toast.  SERIOUSLY, a lot of butter.  I could tell what the toast tasted like LOL.  

The people I went with grew up in Vegas and old Henderson.  I understand this place must have been a familiar place to them growing up.  For me, I wasn't impressed at all.  I might be back to try some actual Mexican food, but believe me.  It's definitely NOT on my top priorities.
