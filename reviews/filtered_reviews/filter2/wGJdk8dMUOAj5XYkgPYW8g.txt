We went to Tia Rosa's because my dad was in town and it's close to my sister's apartment. The patio looked inviting, but the whole experience was lack luster. We were seated on the back patio which was really pleasant, but this meant we were one of our servers few tables outside. Because of this, we rarely saw our server. The other tables outside were annoyed too. The table next to us actually got up to go find her so they could leave.

 I asked her if there was a signature margarita....she didn't really have an answer. My dad asked about the sangria and her response was, "I've never had it." She was nice but didn't sparkle.

The chips and salsa were blah. The guacamole was pre made or from the grocery store...definitely not fresh. The red salsa tasted like the kind in the jar.

I'm surprised to read that people didn't like the meat- that was the only part we did like! It was flavorful and tender. 

The manager brought out our food and our server hadn't cleared our appetizer plates. He began to clear the table and he grabbed my tortilla for my fajitas. Like his whole thumb went into my tortilla....and he did the same thing to my dad's tortillas. Gross. He thought it was funny. He also couldn't figure out how to turn on the heater and tried like 4 of them to the point of being awkward.

Basically, there are better Mexican restaurants in the valley. Skip this one.
