We stayed at the Monte Carlo and had a couple of complimentary drink passes so we decided to check this place out. We arrived on a Friday and after spending all day driving and shopping at the Forum Shops and the shops at Planet Hollywood (can't remember the mall name) we decided to 'take it easy' and save the major clubbing until Saturday night....at least our plan was to "take it easy". We were going to get 1 drink then head back to our room or do some gambling. But you know how that goes.....1 drink turns into 5 Long Islands and 4 shots and the next thing you know it is 5 am and they are kicking you out! WTF???? Anyways...didn't try the food....drinks were inexpensive (I think.....at least compared to Tryst and XS) but not the best quality of alcohol. Of course I didn't ask for specific brands so I am sure their house stuff was cheap and most likely the reason I had a killer headache in the morning. At the higher end clubs I didn't ask for specific brands either but I guess for $16 a cocktail they better use premium stuff. Fun place but definitely not a club or a hot spot in Vegas. 
Very casual attire......jeans.
