Barrio Queen is a "nouvelle" mex place, so if you are looking for real Arizona mex food this is not for you. It was different and the service fine but the portions teeny and the prices upscale. We laughed when our order of TWO tacos was delivered on a plate about 3" in diameter at a spendy price. They were good but Aaron Sanchez I think would have giggled. French fries (wow fries not beans) were a little underdone with the chille relleno "sandwich") I ordered. It just had a big fat hot chili on top of it). Even the waiter said he didn't eat the chili and neither did most other people. Sorry we paid for it. Okay if you are not hungry and don't crave real az-mex!
