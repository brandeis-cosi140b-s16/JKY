The first time the hostess tried to seat us, I asked if it was okay to get seated somewhere else instead so we could watch the game on the tv. The hostess said there would be a wait, which I was okay with. About 10 minutes later, they tried to seat us in the same table i had asked NOT to be seated at because we couldn't watch the game. I had to ask again if I could have a different table. We ordered an appetizer, it never actually got to our table though. Our server would never come check if we needed refills or anything, only once maybe. When we received our check, the appetizer was charged even.though we never received it, so I had to ask the manager if she could remove it. The only positive is that the food was pretty good. Not coming back.
