My husband and I went to Steel Cactus yesterday for lunch.  The space is really cool, and the menu is very promising, but the execution just doesn't quite work out and we ended up disappointed.

We ordered:
--chips and gringo salsa:  shouldn't chips and salsa be free?  That gripe aside, these were quite good.  The salsa had a nice favor and good kick from the jalapeños, and the chips tasted fresh.
--fish tacos:  "Grilled Mahi, red onion confit, pineapple, avocado, cilantro, & cayenne lime cremè" sounds amazing, and it almost was, except they burnt the fish.  I'll give them points for the idea, but it didn't quite work out.
--chipotle brisket tacos:  another dish that sounded fantastic but then just wasn't.  I tried a bite of my husband's lunch-- the barbecue sauce was fantastic and the pomegranate seeds were a nice touch, but the meat itself tasted oddly like bacon and not at all like slow-cooked brisket.
--rice and beans: came with both tacos.  Nothing extraordinary, but no complaints.
--Pacifico: I'll give props to anywhere that carries my favorite Mexican beer, but lime and a glass would've been nice.

Also-- do they have breakfast, or brunch on Saturdays?  There was a bloody mary bar, but we didn't get a brunch menu.  Then I heard someone at the table next to us ordering a breakfast burrito, and was kind of disappointed because that probably would have been my order.

On the bright side, the prices are reasonable, the service is good and I'm a fan of the neighborhood.  I haven't been thrilled with Pennsylvania Mexican food yet, and unfortunately Steel Cactus was not the exception.  I'll have to keep looking.
