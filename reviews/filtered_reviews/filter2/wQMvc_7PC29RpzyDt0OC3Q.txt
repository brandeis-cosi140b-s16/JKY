Food is good but does not make up for the lackluster performance by the bar staff. I often eat here and get take out a couple times a week because it's around the corner from my house and like I said the food is good and price is reasonable. Dine in staff is friendly and I recommend it to anyone. Just dont go to the bar where they are to busy trying to be cool rather than getting the job done.

My last trip here I went in and ordered my food.  Simple, 2 tacos and a chicken burrito to go.  A side of chips and green salsa.  No problem.  I wait in the bar area, where I ordered and watched ESPN.  No biggie.  about 5 minutes in a guy brings a bag from the back.  I assume its my order but they do take phone in orders as well so I decide to wait as it could belong to someone else .  I continued to wait.  About 15 minutes have gone by and I am sitting at the bar looking at the bar tender while he talks to his buddies about the fantasy football schedule etc.. I eventually ask another employee if he could see where my food was.  He turns around and grabs the bag behind him and ask my name.  I tell him. He hands over the bag thats been sitting there for now 20 minutes.  WTF.  Bummer.   I live next door but it is more efficient to drive to Tia Rosa Taquiria on the other side of town than it is to see the clowns in action.  

I stopped going here now simply to avoid more issues and no longer recommend it to friends. 

it;s a bummer because the food is good but does not make up for a lackluster experience.
