Sylvia's is Meh... I really don't have much more to say about it. 

From the walk up and order "service" to the salsa bar that children are allowed to play in... meh.

Now, it's not HORRIBLE it's just not the best Mexican I've had. My last trip I had the green chile enchiladas. The chile was not flavorful and I was left unimpressed with their rice and beans. 

Maybe I need to go and order something of the grilled variety and give them another shot. Right now, I remain unimpressed by Sylvia and her Canasta.
