Maybe I just went at a bad time but to me it seems like the girl who made my order was in a huge hurry to wrap up the burrito and forgets to ask if I wanted anything else in it. The chicken seems as though it has been sitting a while seeing it was as dry as my dogs treats..... Overall not satisfied AT ALL. One of the worst cafe rio locations I've ever been to.
