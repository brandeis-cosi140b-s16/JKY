Food was sitting for a while first time here and the server behind the counter needs to work on her service skills. No recommendations,  no offer to taste first. Seemed to have no problem with just wizzing through. Employees need to work on professionalism. I'm not sure what to think of this place. Hmm
I guess I don't feel like I'm welcomed to come back as there was no stretch to make me a return customer.

Added; I got home and found myself dissapointed in the meal I purchased.. I got the Palehu beef, for both myself and my partner. The amount for the $$ was not impressive. I have never had palehu anything that had so much Chinese 5 spice or licorice flavor ever in my life. I respect everyone's  individual spin on a recipe, however this caught me off guard. Also was very over cooked in the dry bark kind of way. I grew up with an entirely different concept of Palehu and this place did not hit the mark at all.
Service Food not coming back and supporting this place.
