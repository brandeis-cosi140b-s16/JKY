Good, not great, Mexican cuisine located inside the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. I had a few tacos and a burrito that were both delicious, but again nothing really outstanding or special, just the usual Mexican fare. I had some great margaritas that did prepare me for a night out in Sin City. I agree with Chili B. too that this place was over priced.
