I took a friend here thinking maybe she would like it because of the high rating. I thought maybe I just had a average run there (giving it a 3 star rating). The food wasn't anything to return to and the owner didn't really want to honor the free Yelp check in. He said it was an older offer. My friend who is new to Yelp was excited to try it but wasn't blown away like the high star rating claims. I wasn't either. Fool me twice. . . .
