I'm always very picky when it comes to Mexican food and this place didn't really impress me at all. I ordered the number 4, a taco with some type of pork meat in it and was disappointed that there was barely any meat in it at all. The flavor was overly salty and it also came out luke warm. 

The service wasn't bad though, the waitress was nice and the place was nice too. 

Overall won't be coming back here...overpriced and nothing special about the food.
