I have gone to Barrio Cafe a few time because I keep wanting to feel differently about it. It is in Central Phoenix which is fine but it is difficult to find a place to park. The decor of this place is my favorite they have so much beautiful art from local artists everywhere. I even love their slogan but alas "Comida Chingona" it is not. The first time I went I had the "Enchiladas de Mole" but really 18$ for four small Enchiladas the second time I had  the Mango, Tomate & Camaron salad that was also ok but 14$ for 6 shrimp. We also ordered the "Guacamole Casero"  they make it at your table but it was poorly made and then they added dried cranberries I still don't know why they do that. One of my friends ordered the "Cochinita Pibil" that was also just ok. I think the idea and decor are awesome but the food is just really not worth the price. I would be OK with paying good money for Great food but this is just not the place for that.  My table was full of people from Mexico City and Guadalajara Mex needless to say this did not fill the craving we had for fine Mexican dinning. The place is small and a little loud but I don't mind that at all, it was the food that really disapointed. So I will get my Comida Chingona elsewhere because Barrio Cafe sadly did not have it.
