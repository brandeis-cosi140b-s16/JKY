Cool concept and cool atmosphere but bad service and ok tacos. The tortillas used for the tacos are too thick for the delicate flavors inside of them which over powered all of my choices (Thai, duck, pork adavada, and cherry steak). I was looking forward to tasting all the ingredients throughout a bite, which were amazing, not momentarily and then followed by nothing but tortilla..
