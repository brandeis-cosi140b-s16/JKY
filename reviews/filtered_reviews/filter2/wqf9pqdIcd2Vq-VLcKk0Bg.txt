This place is cool but I've had better Mexican food. The carne asada tacos are good, not a fan of there guacamole. I've also had better. My family liked it. I can go without coming here again. I loved the different varieties of meat and the spicy pork is the best taco here and of course I love my Horchata..can't go wrong with that. It's always overcrowded and you have to go on a hunt just to get a seat. Good thing is it's open late a good place for a quick grub or after the club hunger in Vegas.
