I've been eating at this restaurant for years and I've never had a problem with the food. I could eat those dips they serve with the chips all day long! The reason I'm only giving them a two star review is the fact that while I still eat here I've received consistent poor service from the waitstaff. They just aren't very friendly and our drinks stay empty for far too long even when the restaurant isn't busy. I usually just get take out nowadays if I decide to stop by. I've been on the look out for good Mexican food closer to home.
