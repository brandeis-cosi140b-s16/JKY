$14 for a burrito that was mediocre at best is just a ripoff. Yes they make the tortillas in front and it was an asi asi burrito but nothing special that would make me pay that much for it again. It was late and I was hungry so I decided to at least give it a try with an open mind and I guess that included an open wallet.

Unless you are a Pink Taco connoisseur save your money and just go to Mr. Lucky's, which isn't that better, or Subway across the street if a hunger attack happens to strike.
