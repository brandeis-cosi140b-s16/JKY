I really really wanted to like this place. It was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and looked amazing. Looks, in this case, were deceiving.

Definitely a fun and interesting atmosphere. The walls were decorated by adoring customers and employees...and probably more than a few wise ass college students. Everything was wood finished and it felt like a little cantina one might find in Cabo.

We walked in and no one greeted us, but there was a man in the corner with sunglasses on and a lap top in front of him that just stared at us creepily. I later realized that he was the owner (I recognized him from the show)....Okie dokie.

On to the food. My wife and I shared the camarones, carne asada, pollo, pescado, carnitas, and shanghai tacos. The only ones even remotely memorable were the carnitas and carne asada. They both had a nice char on the meat and good flavor...but nothing special and not any better than any other run-of-the-mill taco joint. My main complaint about everything was the complete lack of flavor...in particular, acid and salt. Everything was in dire need of seasoning. I don't care how many ingredients you put in your marinade, if there's no salt, it's bland. In addition, PLEASE serve all tacos with a lime!

The last thing I want to talk about are the tortillas. They were so incredibly tiny for the sheer amount of filling that's in each one. After one bite, everything falls out into your hands and the only thing in which to wipe them off are tiny, thin, little square bev naps...I went through about 30 of them.

No brightness, no pop, no spice, bland flavors and a tortilla delivery system that falls way too short, Yayo Taco doesn't live up to the hype.
