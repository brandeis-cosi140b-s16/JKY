I haven't been to On the Boarder since probably 2002 at the location in Aliso Viejo, while I was out in Vegas we decided to give it a try. We chose their 3 for $11.99. Between the two of us, we purchased; House Salad, Chile Rellano, Chicken Tostada, Pork Tamale, Chicken Taco and cheese enchilada.

GROSS GROSS and MORE GROSS. The chicken was dry, the red sauce was more like brown gross sauce. The best thing was the salad, & the rellano hands down. Rice was hard also.  

Never going back.
