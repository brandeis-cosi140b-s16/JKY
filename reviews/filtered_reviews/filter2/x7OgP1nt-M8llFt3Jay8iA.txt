Not a value for a regular dinner... but nice beer pub. 

I was not wooed like I expected. My daughter ordered the Vegan Nachos and for $16 we got 1/2 oz of vegan cheese and a few grilled veggies on a pile of dry chips. It was the same portion as the "appetizer chips and salsa" which were properly priced at $3.50 . Waiter said the Vegan dish was a large portion and "sharable". The rest of us ordered smaller dishes counting on that. Boy were we surprised. The "huevos rancheros were ok for $10, the cheeseburger was fair priced but is not a "deal" and the tortilla soup was a large cup, not a bowl - but again fair for the price ($5 or so). Good 80's videos, nice bar - Ill go there to drink but its not a dinner spot for us in the future. The menu is extensive but the quality/portion vs dollar value is that of "Bar food". There are much better places to eat for less money.
