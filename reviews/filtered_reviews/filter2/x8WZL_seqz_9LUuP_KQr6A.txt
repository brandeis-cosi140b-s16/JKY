What happened to you?

This place, specifically this Macayo's, used to be so good when I was a kid. I came back here last weekend and I was so disappointed. Everything about this place just seemed way sloppier than how it used to be.

Essentially, Macayo's is one of the staple eateries of Phoenix. It's like a bastard cousin of Garcia's (RIP). It's the typical Americanized Mexican food, nothing too spicy but plenty of taste and it's heavy too. It's true though what the reviews have described it as: a Mexican TGI Friday's or Denny's.

It's so sad to see Macayo's in the state. It's like that girl you used to think was cute when you were in junior high... but then you bumped into her a few days ago at the grocery store and she looks worn out in every sense of the word after surviving through four kids and three divorces. C'mon, Macayo's! Take care of yourself!
