Food was definitely overprice for the two small tacos you receive. Fish tacos were $14 with a small side of beans. I left the place hungry... and what Mexican place doesn't serve chips and salsa before you meal? Also, the food was cold when it reached our table. Margaritas were average at best.

Wait staff was good, but food runners had no idea who ordered what. I won't be going back anytime... how difficult is it to mess up Mexican?
