I am not sure how to review this place. I would give it a 4 for drinks/the bar. The drinks are CHEAP and you aren't paying a cover on Mill Avenue.

But the food? I'd give a 1. Who puts lettuce in Guacamole? 2. BLAND, Cold, and Generic. They give you a bottle of "Blow out your colon-hot" or some such at your table...but I want flavor, not an inopportune trip to the bathroom.

Even Filberto's is better if you want cheap, fast Mexican. I feel like the people who give it great reviews were drunk when they walked in and ordered to begin with.  The people who work here are really nice, though, and I'll probably stumble in here a few more times because it's on Mill.
