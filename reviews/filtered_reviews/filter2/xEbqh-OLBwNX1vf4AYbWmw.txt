The food was great. I think what turned me off on this place is that it ends up being a club. Not that I am against clubs, but when you have food like this maybe you should be a nice restaurant and bar. The club part of this place was definitely lacking. I think the Canteen would be better off focusing on the food and bar side of the business rather than the club. Wait staff was sub par and the noise was beyond loud. Great place to go if you don't plan on talking.
