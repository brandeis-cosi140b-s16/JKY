First this place is beautifully put together. I love the lay out better than Mandalay. But the was about the best I can do on compliments . 

Service was mediocre at best. I didn't set the bar too high because I seen the spotty glasses and silverware.  Not a good sign when you walk in to a place. Hostesses seemed lost and we're more concerned with gossip than helping. We didn't expect for four star service but we did expect our server to see how we were on our cold food. But alas no one came by. I did flagged down a manager and notified them my food wasn't hot and he took it away but by this time my friends was cold as well, since she was polite and was waiting so we could eat together. After receiving our food hot, we never seen Hyde nor hare of our server or manager. Enough said. 

Food... well again a good attempt at trying. Not really mexican more tex mex, but it had always been that style. Guacamole was ok. Lacked salt and acid. The shorty enchiladas were ok, but too much sauce made the tortilla mushy. Rice was hard like it was in a steam table for hours. Beans were dry and not a lot of flavor either. 

Overall...maybe they are just getting their footing and I will be back in the near future to try again. I do miss the old border. Much more intimate with the chef and staff , but hinges do change. Hopefully it can get back to what BG was years ago.
