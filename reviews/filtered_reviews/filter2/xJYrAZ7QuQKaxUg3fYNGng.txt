Ummm.... Wow!!! I never thought I'd write a bad review of my favorite restaurant. The winds of change have blown over Dick's and rendered it impotent. I've been coming here for 20 years and never thought... They stopped carrying my favorite beer, removed my and my girlfriend's favorite dishes from the menu and jacked up their prices through the roof (which they've been doing for awhile). The only reason I give them 2 stars is for their 5-star service staff. If it weren't for them.... NO STARS FOR YOU!!!

Save your $$$ and go to the Vig across the street
