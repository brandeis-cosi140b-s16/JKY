Food was ok. It's more like appetizers priced at regular food item costs. The service was bad. The waiter never asked if we wanted anything to drink. We had to stand up and walk over to him to get a drink. My friend asked for a soda and they thought he asked for a salad. Food was enough as I don't eat much, but ended up going next to the hotdog place next to it and was able to enjoy the rest of my lunch there with a hotdog.
