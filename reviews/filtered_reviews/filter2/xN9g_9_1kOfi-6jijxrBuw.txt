It's 6:50pm on Saturday November 28th. This is the single worst service I've ever had. We've had to ask for everything multiple times, from water to salsa. Our waiter came to our table three times total: to get drinks, to get food order, and to clear plates. One of the things that got missed since he didn't check on us once our food came out, was that one of our plates was chicken instead of the beef that had been ordered. Verbatim conversation:

Us: "So we sat around waiting for awhile, and my food was wrong, but I couldn't flag anybody down. So I eventually just ate it.
Waiter: "Do you want me to take it off your bill?"
Us: "That would be nice."
Waiter: "Well you took a bite so I'll get you some sort of discount, but I can't just zero it out."

So why'd you bring it up?

Disinterested, slow, unhelpful. We can just order this food to go, you know.

Edit: I wrote this review while waiting for the check to come, that's how long it took. In the meantime we complained to a manager and they took the incorrect food off the bill. They apologized for the waiter not checking on how our food was, and he was honest enough to tell his manager that he hadn't. It helps, but that should have been done without hassle. And, ideally, they come over after the food comes out and catch their mistake.
