I don't think the sassy waitress with the dyed black bun of hair loved that I was speaking to her in Spanish when I ordered. Ugh. Someone who thinks they speak Spanish! Uh, I do speak Spanish and you keep responding to me in English. Why are you doing this? I'm just telling you I want the machaca enchilada and the pork tamal combo plate. 

I am also curious about the advertised prickly pear margarita. I ask you if its good, and what it tastes like. OK, so you hate my questions, just smile at me please.

So my friend ordered the fundido special, which was a pile of food and then a mess of cheese sauce served on top. Seriously? He's a gringo and he liked it. Oh well.

My combo plate was just OK, nothing really to write home about. Melted cheese has a way of just looking messy and greasy especially when the plate has just been pulled from the microwave. Nothing all that spicy since that would make the gringos skittish.

The prickly pear margarita? Decent but really kind of sweet and pinkish. Apparently this is a very popular place what with the fact that almost every parking place was taken.
