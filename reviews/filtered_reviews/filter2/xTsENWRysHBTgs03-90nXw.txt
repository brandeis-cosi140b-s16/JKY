So I guess if all you have as comparison is other Phoenix restaurants, then this place deserves 3 stars.  However, if you have ever lived in California or traveled in Mexico, this place is over priced and over rated.  Sorry if I offended any fan but you need to try more upscale restaurants outside Arizona.
