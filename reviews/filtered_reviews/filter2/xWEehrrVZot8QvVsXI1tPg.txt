Anyplace that serves green chili deserves at least a 2, probably 3.  As a New Mexican i went in with high hopes, but they faded when the salsa came out.  Tomatillo based green sauce instead of Green Chili?  really?    it was spicy and had a good kick, but when I hear New Mexican, i want the real stuff.  

I ordered the relleno and it was the first place i've ever had one that wasn't fried.  It was just the stuffed chilli wrapped in an omlette style egg.  ok, that was a new one. Not bad, but i'll take the crispy fried one.

The overall taste of food was good and i would go back again just because they serve green chile.  But overall, not very impressive.  

Ever since the Albuquerque Tortilla Factory and Hatch Valley Chile Company went under, it's been a struggle to find good New Mexican food in AZ.
