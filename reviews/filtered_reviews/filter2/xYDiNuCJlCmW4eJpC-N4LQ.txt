I came here on a Friday night with my hubby and 3 year old. This place is really huge with many rooms, and it is child friendly. They have a nice children's menu/coloring book. The waiter we had was pretty good, he served us our food at a good time, and checked to see if we wanted more drinks or needed anything from time to time. 
Their margaritas were good, their complimentary chips and salsa were good, but the entrees we ordered were not good. I ordered their chika chika boom boom and it was ridiculously spicy! My husband ordered an enchilada plate, and his was also way too spicy! Why was there no warning about how spicy their dishes were on the menu?
It was hard to enjoy my meal since my mouth was burning. Other than that, the service was ok, the decor was nice, but overall the food is the most important thing at  a restaurant, so we won't be coming back to Chuys.
