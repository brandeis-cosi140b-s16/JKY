Food is good but customer service needs work. Took my 2 year with me, figured we'd share a burrito, asked for a side of rice and beans in a small Dixie cup, got charged a dollar for each.  Never once was offered the free cheese quesadilla meal for children under six. Maybe that's my fault for only scanning the menu, just would have been nice to have been offered the free meal when I was ordering or when I complained that the rice and beans were for my kid who I was holding.

On the plus side, I will never forget they offer a free kids meals!!! As long as you ask for it.
