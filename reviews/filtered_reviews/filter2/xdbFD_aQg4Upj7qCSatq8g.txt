When will we learn? We came in here tired and starving after half a day of walking down the strip. We were seduced by the all day $2 specials, but really the warning signs were there.

we started off ordering the $2 margaritas which quenched the thirst, but were all syrup and next to no alcohol (no real surprise). We followed that up with a taco salad and queso fundido. We got full quick, but neither were very appetizing. The biggest sin of the meal, though, was that they served chili with the taco salad rather than pinto or refried beans.

Overall, for Las Vegas, this joint is cheap, but you have so many other options you might as well spend a little more and enjoy your meal.
