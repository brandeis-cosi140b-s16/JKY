I was very excited to try this place, meaning I paid almost $60 in cab fare to come out and try this place (we stayed at the Bellagio), but I was so disappointed!!

The meat was not tender at all, especially the pork. The chicken is tasteless. The misubi was way too salty. The portions was not huge as many yelp reviews said it was. The only thing I liked from the mountain of food is the beef kimchi fried rice. But it wasn't spectacular. Any decent korean place will taste just as good. 

Here is what we ordered:
Beef kimichi fried rice: very good

Combo two meat plate: horrible. Chicken was tasteless. The pork was like ground pork, mushy, which was really weird. 

Pork belly misubi: way too salty. I took one bite and threw it away. 

Chicken wings: okay. Drenched in sauce. 

Shrimp and chicken tacos: okay. Nothing too special about it that you can't get from a taco truck.
