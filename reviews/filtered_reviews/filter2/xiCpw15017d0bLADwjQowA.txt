If you want store brand, cheap salsa to go along with the rest of your bland food, this is the place to go!

We live fairly close to this location and have heard mixed reviews, some have explained the horrible things it will do to your stomach while some have said it's the best in the valley. 

We came in for dinner last weekend to give it a try. Boy were we disappointed...

First off, the salsa tastes good but if I wanted store bought salsa, I would stop at Fry's and pick some up on my way home. When I go out to eat at a Mexican restaurant I expect they aren't opening a jar of Pace and dumping it into a bowl. 

I ordered the taco salad with shredded chicken. While there was a lot of chicken, I couldn't believe they used bagged lettuce with giant chunks of carrots and radishes. At no point does a taco salad recipe call for carrots or radishes. It was a cheap presentation on top of cheap ingredients. 

I will say the guacamole was good, I'd love to know what store they buy it from so I can pick some up as well. 


We have no desire to be back. If you want some good Mexican food try Don Ruben's on Cactus.
