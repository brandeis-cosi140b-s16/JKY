I agree with some of the reviews, this place has the potential to be a go-to Downtown Phoenix restaurant, but falls short on so many levels. The only part of my meal that I can say was good was the chips and salsa - that is the only thing they have down. The staff was okay.  But there are so many other restaurants near here that it is going to hard to come back.

They have a great outdoor patio and location so they have the ability to thrive. My coworkers and I all felt the same way, our main entrees were awful.  All I had was a salad and soup, and I'm not sure how that can be messed up but it was.  There was not enough flavor and overall zest.

Canyon was kind supplying us with white peppermint chocolate tamales for dessert, which were quite tasty. But that is not going to be enough to win back the meal.
