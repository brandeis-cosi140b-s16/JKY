Very disappointed for a Restaurant from the Stratos group. They need to stick with their Greek inspired roots. Absolutely flavorless enchildas and my wife had the most disappointing chicken Fajitas ever. Unlike EVERY other Mex and Tex Mex spot, no complimentary chips and salsa. That feature will cost you $4 bucks. My waiter was nice enough to "comp" an order of their chips and trio of salsa's on the hoouse since it was our first visit but outside of the Mango, the Roja and Tomatillo were average at best. Expensive for what you get, I would recommend nearby Paco's Taco's and Tequila in a heartbeat and they bring free and awesome chips and salsa and definitely better food for the $$$.
