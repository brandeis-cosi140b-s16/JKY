I expected to be a lot more impressed... unfortunately I was not.  I had dinner here with my mother, her first time staying at the Cosmo, and she really isn't all that big into exploring new cuisines since she's been stuck in her Italian ways.  I was really hoping to provide her with a culinary experience that would broaden her horizons.  I was disappointed... the tacos were ok, but nothing amazing.  The sea salt foam margarita was too salty.  We ordered from both menus, and even the bao's were only "ok".  I feel that it was overpriced for what we received and only mediocre in food quality.  I will say though that the staff was very nice and patient with our ordering at the bar, though it took a very long time to receive our check.
