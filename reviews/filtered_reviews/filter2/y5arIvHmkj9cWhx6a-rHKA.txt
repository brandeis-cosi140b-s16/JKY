This was my first time visiting here- I try to go to the smaller mom/pop eateries to support the local economy, plus the food is much better than the chain locations. I ordered the beef burrito with green sauce. Its a good-sized portion, and the green sauce is pretty good. The burrito itself was like a flour bag of plain beef with jalapenos thrown in. Lots of heat, but no flavor at all or seasonings in the meat. So I wasn't impressed at all with this item. I will go back and try something else next, hopefully that may be a bit better!
