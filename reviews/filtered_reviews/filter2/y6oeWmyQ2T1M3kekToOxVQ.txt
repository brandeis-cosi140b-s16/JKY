Amazing food, horrendous service!

Are large group (eight total) was seated at a very quick pace, but that was when the service ended. It took 20 minutes to flag down a hostess to get a waiter.  The gentleman that waited on us (pretty sure he wasn't our waiter to begin with) was rude, gave me a margarita that looked like it had had two sips taken from it...

Food took 2 hours to be served.  That being said, the food was all amazing. Tortilla soup was bomb and the Guac was to die for!  I would give this place one more chance to make up for the lack of service, the food was damn good.
