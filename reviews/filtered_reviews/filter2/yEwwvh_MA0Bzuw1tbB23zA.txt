Not sure what all the raves are about.  I ordered the fish burrito - thin fried fish inside my burrito and just OK on the flavor.  As my husband & I were sitting at a table waiting for our order to be called - a worker was walking by every table around us sweeping the floor.  Probably should wait to do this when there aren't people eating at tables - kinda gross.  My biggest issue is that I LOVE carne asada fries so I ordered them here.  Well as I posted in my pic - I got uncooked floppy fries covered with a thin puree of avocado with cotija cheese chunks mixed in, topped with about a 1/4 cup of carne asada and pico de gallo.  The floppy fries killed me.  It's unforgivable.  They can fry a decent tortilla chip (maybe their pre-bought) so why not fry a crispy fry?  I cannot revisit this establishment sadly since I cannot get the taste of uncooked fries and liquid guacamole out of my mouth.  Sorry Original Burrito company.
