After wanting to try this place out for the longest time, it was a huge disappointment. I had the bulgogi fusion burrito. It was not good. Everything inside lacked flavor. It was very bland. Inside the burrito consisted of rice, bulgogi, lettuce and pico de gallo. I even tried their salsa they gave me with the burrito which didn't help with the blandness. 

Maybe I ordered the wrong thing but it was disappointing. I may try giving it a second chance in the future.
