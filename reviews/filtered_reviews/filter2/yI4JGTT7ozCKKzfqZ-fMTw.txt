The atmosphere is nice, beautiful restaurant and great outdoor place. Service?The server was nice, recommended the house specialty margarita: not so great.  It took a while before he came back to take our order. It took even a lot longer to get the check in the end. We ordered the quesadilla as a starter-it was weird...tasted like they used too much and too "fake" cheese...Than we had a combination fajita-the portion was big, but no flavor-we also got 3 pieces of tortillas with it. I did not like the desert- too "eggy"- we ordered the flan. Overall...unfortunate that such a beautiful location does not offer better food....and the service is just mediocre,not sure I will go back.
