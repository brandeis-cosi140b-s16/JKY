It was a Saturday Night and we met up with my bro-in-law and his friends.  They were eating at the counter, first come first serve (I think).  Luckily, 5 minutes after chatting, 2 people got up so that we could sit. (Bonus points for the purse hooks under the counter!)
(Since China Poblano is located across Marquee, it was crazy to see how long the line was at 8:00PM!!)

I'm only rating on a few items, because that is all we had to try.  We ate a good brunch and some Sam Woo (boo) mid-afternoon..so we ordered only 2 tacos to try.

I ordered the Pancita al Pastor Taco:  slow-cooked pork belly/ pineapple $5.50 - I ate it in 2.5 bites! It was okay..NOT "GOOOD" like I was hoping.  It didn't really satisfy my tastebuds.  But the way they sliced the pineapple long ways and so thin was interesting.   I did not feel that the taco was worth the $5.50.

My hubby ordered the Viva China Taco:  soft beef tendon/ Kumamoto oyster/scallions/ Sichuan peppercorn sauce $5.50 - done in 2 bites!  He said is was VERY SALTY!

Someone orderd the Papas Fritas with mole poblano / Mexican cream / queso fresco.  Nothing to rave about.  Just fries with the mentioned above ingredients.
The best thing I tasted there was the Salt Air Margarita.  Think Margarita Martini with a Salt foam topping instead of Salt Rim.  Very eye catching too!

A few weeks later, I found out, to my surprise, that my Mom's favorite Chef, Jose Andres owns China Poblano - which made it a little more dissapointing.

The decor of lights, changing LCD picture frames, bicycle wheels was really different and neat.  I don't know that I would come here again - because by the time we go to Vegas again, there will be more and other places to try.

PS.  What's with the warm tap water??  You would think they would have "normal" ice water.
