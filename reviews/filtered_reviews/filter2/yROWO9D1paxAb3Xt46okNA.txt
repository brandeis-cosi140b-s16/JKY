Wow, what can I say! The worker at the hotel we were staying at highly recommended this place! It was waaaay overrated. I got the "famous" egg souffl√© relleno, which was honestly pretty disgusting. You have to really really really like eggs (in the words of the waitress). Everything was way too cheesy. 

However, The salsa seemed homemade and was actually pretty good. I would not highly recommend this place. I feel kinda sick after eating it.
