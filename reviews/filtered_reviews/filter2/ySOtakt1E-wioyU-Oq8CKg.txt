According to yelp, Monday stated that this spot was open around lunchtime.  When we arrived someone let us know the Fuego is NEVER open at that time on Monday.  It was disappointing because I was really looking forward to having my favorite menu item AND use my gift card.  Instead I had to settle for wack ass Tom's Tavern!  It wasn't really wack but I just wasn't in the mood for a sandwich or a $32 bill.  I don't know if this is a yelp error or Fuego error but please fix this.
