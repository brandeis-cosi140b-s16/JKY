The food was pretty good...about 4 stars good.  The service is a different story...maybe 1 star and that is being generous.
We were basically ignored the whole time we were there by our server.  Took forever to get her to take our drink order and then when she did finally bring our drinks mine was wrong, had ordered a margarita with NO salt and of course it had salt.  I had ordered a side of sour cream and of course she forgot it, and once I realized this had to flag down a different server because our server had once again disappeared.  My husband asked for another when she brought our dinner out...10 minutes later no beer so asked the hostess to find our server since we had not seen her since she delivered the food.  When she did finally bring the beer blamed it on the bartender.  Never once did she come over to our table after bringing our meal out and asked us if everything was ok or if we needed anything else.  Let me add they were not busy at all so no excuse really for this horrible service.
This was our second visit to Baja Joe's, the first visit being a few months ago and had a wonderful server and a very pleasurable experience.  But after this last visit we won't be back.
