Blah blah blah what's all the hype about.  Ordered the grilled corn it was cooked perfectly with just enough sauce to piss you off.  Anyone with common sense would serve it with a side of sauce or at least more than the tiny squirt they give you.  Ordered the $18.00 taco plate each taco graciously stuffed with a full tablespoon of meat- what a joke.  Our food was cold and nats where constantly landing in our salsa bowls.  The server Sandra did an excellent job and you can tell she truly believes in the food unfortunately it's overpriced for the portions and lacking flavor and temperature.  There are many other Mexican food places I would visit prior to a return here.  Service and atmosphere are excellent minus the bugs food is C-.  The  couple sitting next to us ordered a sandwich to share the each took one bite  commented on how bad it was and left.  The Carne Asada Tacos had decent flavor and had its moments but nearly every bite was interrupted by a hard piece of chewy fat or something nasty.
