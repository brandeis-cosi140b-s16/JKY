Deep in the belly of Aria rests the higher-end Mexican restaurant, Javier's. 

We came here as a small group of four, and right off the bat the staff was welcoming and accommodating.  We came with an open mind, knowing that prices on the strip are much more than similar places off the strip.  It was a night out, so not a big deal.  

We sat under the huge wood piece of the dead, which looks fantastic in a Mexican restaurant!  If it were anywhere else, I'd say let's go someplace else.  I ordered the fajitas de pollo, but it came out as the fajitas de beef.  Still, it was very tasty, so no complaints here.  Not a lot of food for the price, but I ate the hell outta their chips and salsa, so I was none too hungry.  Now I rarely drink, but I had to try their margarita de grenada, the pomegranate one.  For $15, it better have some kick to it.  Someone tell me why it was like drinking generic brand kool-aide?  Really!  It had about as much alcohol content as a bottle of water.  Pathetic.  

So, it was somewhat of a nice dining experience, but truly, I have experienced better.  I think Javier's could get more stars from me if their bartenders weren't stingy.  Also, if they had a happy hour, or a set price group dining option.
