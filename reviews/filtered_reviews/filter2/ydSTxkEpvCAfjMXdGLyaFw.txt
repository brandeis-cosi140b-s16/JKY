Went here last night with some girl friends and had a decent time. Seems like everyyything that had alcohol in it was $6. Shots of generic tequila, draft beers, and mixed drinks. So if youre gonna drink, just get shots because their mixed drinks SUCK and their beer is warm. I asked for a long island and got nasty watered down juice crap. Seriously the worst drink I ever had. Long islands are supposed to be strong! I had to ask the bartender outside to fix it. Apparently she knows the bartenders inside cant mix for sh*t too. Music was mostly spanish, almost made me want to leave but then they played some good stuff for like 30 min. Nobody can dance by the way. Guys and girls. Lots of older ppl and lots of shaved heads. Idk....i would say if you cant go anywhere else, this should be your last resort. Or else just get drunk and you wont really care too much.
