Where to start.... Service was slow, food was dull.
Carnesada burrito had hardly any meat. Rice was blah and dry. Steak fajitas were actually pretty good, could of done with out so many onions and bell peppers.
We had to pay for the chips and salsa which was $2.99 but then u get unlimited after the first serving.
Got a really great drink but that was $10 don't think that was worth it.
Our total bill for two people not including tip was $53
FOR MEXICAN FOOD that wasn't even great.
They get two stars, cool atmosphere and and tasty drink
