I had high expectations of this place, especially when previewing the prices on the menu screen at the casino entrance. First off, I think it's weird that they have an entrance from the casino but you have to walk through the restaurant to get to the hostess both.

Since it was nice outside, my fiance and I asked if we could be seated outside. The view was great and it didn't take long for us to be greeted by our server who was really nice. The menu is small, and like other reviews have said, the descriptions for each item are vague. We both decided to order tacos ($16 for each order) thinking they would be the bomb dot com. SIKE. They were terrible. Very bland. You can honestly get better tasting food from Robertos and save more than half than what we spent.
