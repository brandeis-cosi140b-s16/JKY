This place had a cool atmosphere and the staff was friendly but the food was disappointing. We had a taco, an enchilada, and a wet burrito and all were not good. The onion rings tasted frozen and the ingredients in our meals tasted like they were old and cheap. Probably a fun place to have some drinks but not so good for dinner
