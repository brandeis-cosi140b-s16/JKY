Two colleagues and I visited this place for lunch today.  Only a so-so experience.  I have been to Via de many, many times having grown up in the Sunnyslope area.  They have consistently had good food and great margaritas.  But today's experience will make it tough to recommend.

We were seated promptly and had waters and chips and salsa soon thereafter.  We took some time to look at the menu and decided on 2 MaryLou's with red sauce and a green corn tamale.  They were all lunch specials that came with our choice of rice and beans.  The food arrived within about 10 minutes and everybody enjoyed their meal.  

My major gripe about this place was the service.  Once our meals were delivered we didn't see a server again.  I had to stop a staff member who was passing by to get some water refills (we were all down to less than 1/2" inch of water in our already small glasses).  No one came by to check and see if we were enjoying our meals or if we needed anything else to complete the meal.  When we were ready to leave, we had to go up to the front to get our bill and a to go box.  Via de is a place where you pay at the register but I still expect the bill to at least be dropped off.  They didn't appear to be exceptionally busy and I saw customers at two other tables looking around for someone to assist them.  Bad, bad service.  I don't know that I would head back when there are plenty of great Mexican food places in town with much better service.
