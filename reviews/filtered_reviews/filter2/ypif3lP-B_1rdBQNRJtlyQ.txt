I keep getting dragged here by my best friend and I gotta say...I haven't had one thing that I've liked.  
The portions are big but the food is so gross it doesn't matter. 
The time before last I had nachos cuz' I was thinkin'....you can't screw that up!  Blech....the chips tasted like they were a month old and fried in the same oil from 1956.  I'm not that picky but these chips were icky. My tummy wasn't right for two days afterwards.  
The last time I got a burrito...enchilada style. It was a gross mushy mess.  The rice was so mushy and overcooked.  It had rice, black beans, and 8 measly little strips of steak.  They dumped some green sauce all over it and threw it in a warmer.  Yuck.  Did not like. Waste of $8.79.  I'd rather have Chipotle any day!!! 
They had a machine with horchata & two different types of agua frescas but it was empty.  Boo.
