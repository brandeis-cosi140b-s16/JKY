What a disappointment!   The ambiance is nice.  Great lounge and wonderful selection of tequila's but if you are here to eat - we have way better in this area!   The food is bland and lifeless.   Neither my husband's entree or mine came to the table hot in the middle and they lacked seasoning.  My burrito was soggy and boring.  My husband's burrito was ice cold in the middle.   The salsa's are different but the chips are not freshly made like other venues.   The service is very attentive - honestly and the manager was very polite and apologetic upon hearing about our dining experience.  We will not be back though.  Too bad.
