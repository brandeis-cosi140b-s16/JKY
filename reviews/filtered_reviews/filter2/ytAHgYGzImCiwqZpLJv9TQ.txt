I have been into SOL many times and really don't expect too much when I go.  The margaritas have tasted different each time.  Bartenders seem to free pour too much and aren't consistent with one another.  The bartenders however, are very aware and social which is a plus.  
I will say that the Naked Guac is really good in addition to the Civeche Sol.  
The bar area is a little difficult to get to once people are seated in the restaurant. The bar itself is beautiful and neat but not convenient if you have more than 4 in your party.  
The only reason I stayed with 2 stars is because I have not seem a bathroom like this since a college frat party.  There were paper towels all over the ground and the divider for the mens urinal looks like it is about to fall off the wall at any time.  
The bathroom is used by staff in addition to patrons so I would think there is an opportunity to have it a little nicer..
