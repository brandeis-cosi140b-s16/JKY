This review is for people like me, who see the great reviews and want to try it out. I buy that it is authentic and I buy that the food is ok, but it also seems to be overinflated due to some bandwagon hype.

Obviously, this is only one experience, but I went with my wife on one of the first nice Saturday afternoons of the spring. When we arrived, it was absolutely packed and some people were just milling around outside. I poked my head inside to find a small room with the dingy "kitchen" right there surrounded by bar-style seating. I say "kitchen" because there were at least two microwaves going at all times. 

Maybe things are different when it isn't crammed full of people, but I had no idea whether to sit, wait, walk through to the back (where there is apparently more seating) or try to give a take-out order. We were eventually offered a seat by the waitress and placed our order. I got a steak torta...I don't recall what my wife had because they brought the wrong thing out at first. I have no idea how they could have kept track of the orders with all the people there. I will say this, the tortra was huge and the food came out fast...so fast that I almost suspect is was someone else's order that also had a torta, since my wife's plate was incorrect. When we were done, neither of us were overwhelmed by the food.

So, first timers, just be aware of what you may be walking into. Based on the majority of the reviews, I was disappointed.
