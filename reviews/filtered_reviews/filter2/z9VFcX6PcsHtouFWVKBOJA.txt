As a transplant from California, I'm kind of a snob about Mexican food. About the best Mexican you can get in Pittsburgh is at Los Cabos (they do carne asada burritos right). As I understand it, the idea behind Casa Reyna is to serve more food from other parts of Mexico (that aren't close to the US border), and maybe that's so. However, I found that the food here just wasn't that... interesting. I mean, everything tasted perfectly ok, but it seemed to lack any real flavor. The chips and salsa were the one exception: as good as everyone says they are. But the rest of it, I found to be really kind of lacking. The ceviche had these tiny, tiny shrimp that just absolutely had no taste to them, for example. I don't get it; serve me some actual crustaceans and charge me more. The entrees were similarly bland; I had a fish entree and my girlfriend had a sort of pasta-like thing, which was the only thing that actually seemed to have some interesting sauce on it. Reyna was ok to try, but I doubt I'd go back there the way I go back to the better restaurants in Pittsburgh.
