It's still hot. They now have table service, and it is terrible. It seems like morale is really low at this place. The hosts and waitstaff look like they all can't wait to leave, and that shines thru while they're "helping" you.

If you are looking for great Mexican food, take a trip 8 miles south and go to the Original La Canasta.
