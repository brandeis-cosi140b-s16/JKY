I probably won't go back. Our server was awful. My food was okay but the gal I was with had to send back her order twice because the cook couldn't stick to the menu item (one of the wraps). After the second time going back to the kitchen we decided we would just get mine to go and leave, so my friend could get lunch at work. The server then billed us for her food (unreal!) and wouldn't let me talk to the manager after I asked twice.  LUCKILY, the manager ended up coming over because she had to approve taking my friend's meal off the bill. She apologized profusely after we explained the situation and comped the entire bill. That made it right. She also gave us two $5 chips to use should we go back. I'm not sure I will but I have to say the Manager saved the day and this review from being a complete bust.
