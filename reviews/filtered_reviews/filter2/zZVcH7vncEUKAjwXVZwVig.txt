I have only tried this place once. My boyfriend and I saw it on the food network channel DDD so we decided to give it a try. Our food was ok, nothing fabulous but not bad either. There were a lot of flys inside, the beans were very watery, the meat on the torta had good flavor but was missing "something". We might give it another try, maybe we didnt order the right thing.
