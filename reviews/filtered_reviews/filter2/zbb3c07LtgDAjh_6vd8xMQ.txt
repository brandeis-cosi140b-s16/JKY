Ok. I really, really wanted to love this place. TJ style tacos? Yeah, my mouth started watering preemptively...but it was not to be.

I tried both the adobada and the carne asada tacos. The adobada meat was not very flavorful and none of my meat had even a hint of crispiness. The avocado sauce they put on top is tasty, but not enough to make the taco great.

The carne asada tacos were alright. They did not put an actual salsa on them and that would have helped a lot in my opinion. The guacamole was a nice touch. This taco also had a bit of mystery meat in it.

My husband also tried the cabeza and lengua tacos. He found them to be very flavorless.

They do give you grilled onions and chiles and they do make their own tortillas, but the tacos are still very overrated. Maybe we came on a bad day and at a bad time, but still, we've had better tacos.

Also, the line system can be confusing. Basically, you order different tacos at each of the stations.
