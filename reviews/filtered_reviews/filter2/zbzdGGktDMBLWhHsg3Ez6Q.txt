For some reason I expected more from this place. The Al pastor was pretty good but everything else about this place was annoying even the special pink tacos were soggy and fell apart, I don't understand how that's their signature item and its that awkward and gross. Chips and salsa was bland and stale. Then there's the annoying drunk tourists. Lame.
