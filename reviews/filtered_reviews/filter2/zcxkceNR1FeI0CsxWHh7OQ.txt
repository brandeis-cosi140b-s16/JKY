The monkey is out. Sucked monkey balls. Loud, overpriced and cheesy food. Beer was warm too, pissed me off. But it's "on the strip, yay, hoorah, so what! I was surrounded by dirty Mexicans as soon as I stepped foot on the strip outside diablos. Pass on the $20 steak tacos. Taco Bell was just as good .
