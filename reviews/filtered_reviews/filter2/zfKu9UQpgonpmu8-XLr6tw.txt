I was among the large group several other reviewers mentioned that visited Blue Adobe Grille. The points they made in their reviews were right on the money. Because of that, I'll keep this short and add just a few more.

The one server taking care of the group was hit and miss. He paid attention to some and seemed to ignore others. I was encouraging him to go around the table to take each order but instead would take one at a time back to the kitchen, and ignore others as he was walking away. Not very efficient. Still, he was trying, so I'll give him that. One of the two stars above goes to him.

I shared a chicken quesadilla and bean queso dip appetizer. Nothing complicated, but it WAS good. The plates others had looked appetizing also - when and if they ever got them. That accounts for the second star.

The manager, walked up to me at one point near the end of our visit. I was standing by our assigned 4 tables chatting with another person in our group. In an annoyed voice she said, "I'm going to have to ask you to not crowd the other tables."  I was 3 feet away from the next table - I counted the tiles on the floor just to make sure. Is 3 feet considered crowding?
  
Those three blank stars? Lack of follow-through, lack of service and lack of accountability by the manager.
