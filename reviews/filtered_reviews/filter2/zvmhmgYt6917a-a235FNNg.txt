Here, I'll save you the time and trouble. Go to Qdoba or Chipotle for a better burrito. At very least, their employees will kindly take your order and pack a burrito with quality ingredients.

Although the decor in this place is fun, I can't say the same for my time spent eating this burrito. Rice is over-cooked and is more similar to mashed potatoes, my first bite was nothing but a soggy mess of rice. The chicken is dry, un-seasoned, and lacked any flavor whatsoever. I had to cover my burrito in salsa (which is the only half decent item here) in order to actually find some flavor and not be completely upset about the $10 I just spent. The guacamole was being made as I walked, it was fresh - but just your run of the mill guacamole, nothing to look at here folks. 

I'd also like to add that a couple employees seemed to hate their job and didn't really want to take my order. Another guy was much friendlier to the patrons behind me. I should have told them to turn back.

If you are into flour tortillas stuffed with flavorless ingredients, mushy rice, dry meat and prepared by just as bland employees - - this is the place to be!

I'll review their sweet tea separately. I'd give it four stars. Not too shabby!
