Came to Vegas for SHOT show and subsequently never left the Venetian.  Taqueria Canonita, you would  think being so close to the border and with so many people coming from LA to Vegas, they would have some great Mexican food.  I ordered the Santa Rosa Pork Barbacoa at the recommendation of the waiter.  As my stomach churned for that slow cooked, delicious pork, I was greeted with a fairly bland and very dry pork.  I would have been better off with Chipotle's barbacoa than what Canonita served up.  The empanadas that were ordered for the table were far from crispy and the guacamole that came with the tortilla chips were not fully mashed.  Far too many errors for a sit down restaurant to be any good.  On the plus side, the tequila helped me forget the awful food.
