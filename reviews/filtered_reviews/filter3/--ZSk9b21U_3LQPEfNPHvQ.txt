Our waiter was super rude. He asked us what we wanted to order as soon as we sat down. Since he was so rude I had to drive him crazy by being super nice. If not for the groupon we purchased we would've never came here. Free chips with salsa and bean dip. I ordered the shrimp and steak fajitas. Hubby had the shrimp tacos. It was a huge platter of food. Lots of peppers and tomatoes along with my steak and shrimp. We were only given 2 tortillas so I asked for more. Didn't know they were going to charge for more tortillas. Hubby's meal was super small so luckily mine was big so I could share with him. Both of our meals came with rice and refried beans. I do not eat beans and they were mixed on the plate with my rice. Our total came out to $12 which included the groupon discount. So once was enough for this place. Too many other restaurants with better service.
