Same owners as z'tejas. Decent food. The old church they set up in is pretty cool, like the concept but the execution was mediocre. Bartender told me to hold on a sec...which upset me a little bit. Tacos were bland and nothing had that much flavor. I've tried twice but can't bring myself go in again. Sorry guys, hopefully things change for this place. The concept is cool, but the food and service need work.
