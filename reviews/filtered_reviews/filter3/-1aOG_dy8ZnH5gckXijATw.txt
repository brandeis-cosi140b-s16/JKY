The sweet pork burrito was great. I've had the steak salad, which was also good. Consider sharing since portion sizes are huge. They seem to do much better when it isn't busy. It's located in a strip mall, so ambiance isn't the best. It has a chipotle feel to it with cafeteria style serving, concrete floors, etc. pretty typical prices for fast casual.
