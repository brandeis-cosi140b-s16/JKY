We received great service from the host, but once seated the service just dropped off.  Our server was just unavailable. It took forever to get basics like silverware or water, and the chips/salsa were probably a good 20 minutes after we sat down.  We waited so long just to get our cocktails that we started playing the game, "So...do we leave? Do you want to leave? Where would we eat dinner? I'm so okay leaving, I have no problem getting up and just going. Lets give it 3 more minutes? What time is it now..." But then our cocktails were served and we felt we had to stay.

Mr R ordered a really good pork plate. I had the short rib enchiladas. They came alone, without any sides except for a few greens on top. It was all really good. I was very impressed with the kids menus - tons of options for $4-6 a plate. We ordered a $5 plate of the green corn tamale which came with rice and beans. The tamale reminded me more of a corn casserole - not my favorite (nor the favorite of my 18 month old, but he had spent an earlier part of the dinner sucking green salsa off his chips and eating crayons, so not sure his opinion should count).

The patio was beautiful and heated in December, it was a decent place - just not someplace I'd go again.
