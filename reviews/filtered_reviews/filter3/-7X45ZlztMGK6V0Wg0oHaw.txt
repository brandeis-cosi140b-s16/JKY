I'd give the food 3.5 stars - the shrimp ceviche was palatable, but perhaps a little watered down.  The grilled fish tacos were good.

Food came too quick for my liking - Its a restaurant, not a cafeteria.  Appetizer came out minutes after we ordered and the tacos came before we were halfway finished with the ceviche.  I finished my food before I finished my first beer!!
