Finally decided to give this place a try thanks to the purchase of a groupon which made it a pretty great deal but overall I think the prices are a little high for the environment. It is a really tight space that doesn't feel comfortable or inviting at all. They had it decorated in a cool way but that just barely helped it not to feel like we were in a fast food joint. I think they should reconfigure the space and turn it into an order at the counter style where you just grab some tacos and a bucket of beer an head out to the patio (like America's) or take a lunch to go.

We both ordered items that I am pretty sure they have on their menu at the Bistro. Hubby got the pasta which was delicious (yes, I stole a bite) and I ordered the shredded pork torta which was also delicious. Sweet potato fries were yummy with good seasoning on them but unfortunately a bunch had gotten stuck together and formed some kind of mass which was a bit unappetizing. I guess that happens but I don't think they should have served them like that.

Not much else to say, our server was great. Really nice guy though of course I have forgotten his name already. I probably wouldn't drive out of my way to come here for dinner again but if I was downtown for some reason I'd probably grab lunch or happy hour here.
