No tacos!!!! without the tacos...... I won't be back but loved the tacos.......I used to rate it 5 stars... The taco sauce was great too... You could still taste them four hours later.  the line out the door unless you show up before 11 am. the lack of parking. cash only. nasty falling apart tables with zero shade unless you want to sit under that tree on fresh bird shit. No more tacos. No more Ritos. I had this stupid friend from New Hampshire  who tried to go at night and a cop asked him what the hell was he thinking? The cop said get the hell out of here! It was testament to how good the tacos were though.
