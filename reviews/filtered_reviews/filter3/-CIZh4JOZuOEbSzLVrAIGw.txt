I can really only review the beer selection (not bad) and the service (quite good, considering the size of our group).

I did get to watch some of my friends try a habanero burger. The fools. I snacked on a few things and everything was excellent. No, I skipped the habanero buger, thanks all the same.

All and all, a good place. Great atmosphere and a killer patio. I'll go back. And this time, I'll eat.
