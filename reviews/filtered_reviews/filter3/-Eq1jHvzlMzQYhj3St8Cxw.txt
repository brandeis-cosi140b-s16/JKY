Omg what an unorganized group , people waiting for tAbles and people finished eating waiting for the tables to be cleared and given there bill. The staff seams to wonder aimlessly not knowing what to do next. Either they are understaffed or have a lack luster manager to direct. Food here is normally good , but the frustration of watching this staff in action is painful that being said when we finally  got a table  i had to flag down our server to place the order more frustration the food actually showed up in a reasonable time frame and was hot and tasty.we normally go early but we had friends visiting so we showed around 9 am i dont think we left untill 1045ish. it wasnt just me i we were getting ready to leave another guy was complaining about the service. though the food was good and the server was friendly i still muster up 3 stars
