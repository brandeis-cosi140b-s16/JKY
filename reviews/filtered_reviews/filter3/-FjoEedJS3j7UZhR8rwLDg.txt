AAAhhhhh Barrio Queen. So, I've heard wonderful things about Barrio Queen from fellow yelpers. We were here for some cocktails last night. It's in a terrific area... trees were adorned with lights. Since I am a woman with the attention span of a fish... ooohhh look at the lights......

Okay, I'm back. We sat in the patio and I really enjoyed it. My man-friend is smittened by their Limon y coco - this is a margarita made with coconut infused tequila... it was okay. I'm not a fan - to make it a little "authentic", there were like grinded up coconut pieces which made it gritty(?). No thanks! I ordered the paloma which was a grapefruit, lemon/lime and mexican squirt (yes, we went to town with the jokes). OMG!! This was so terribly tart and tangy... I put two packs of raw sugar in it and I ended up leaving 3/4 of the drink. What a waste of $11. We did order the original and chocolate flan. The chocolate was way too decadent... I prefer the original.
