I've only stopped in for carry-out once, so maybe I need to try something else on the menu. I have to assume I'm missing something for this place to be getting such rave reviews. I am a taco fiend and wasn't impressed, especially with the fantastic El Charro being right down the street. 

I ordered two of their "Taco Mexica" with chicken, because I'd heard good things about their "grilled cheese taco." The chicken was shredded and barely had any taste to it, which docks major points in my book. There was basically no seasoning in the meat at all, which is why El Charro wins the chicken taco contest by a landslide. The grilled cheese taco thing was interesting, but I honestly couldn't taste the cheese much, and I covet my cheese, so again, I didn't love it.  

The traditional cilantro and onions topping gave it props in my book, but without tasty meat, what's the point? Maybe their beef is the way to go. They include free chips and salsa with your order, and here again I was disappointed. (I'm such a jerk judging free food, aren't I?) The salsa just wasn't my style. I'm basically obsessed with the tomatoey, cilantro-filled stuff El Toro will dole out for free, and I just can't get into spicy traditional salsa. That's a personal preference, though.
 
The guacamole looked really good, but it was mighty expensive. It's $5.95 served with chips, and you get a giant saucer of it, but El Toro serves up some great guac at only $3.50. (And of course you get free chips and salsa at El Toro.)

I might go back only to try out their fish tacos and guac, just to give the place one more shot. Good fish tacos is the only thing C-U is missing as far as Mexican food goes.
