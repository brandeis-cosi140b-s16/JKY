The pros...had the ceviche tostadas and a few tacos. All very good. If you are into the anorexic model in booty shorts and the unemployed skater look this is your place. The cons...the bar service is painfully slow and unfriendly. Overall feel is the front of house staff thinks they are far cooler than i think they are. A shame because the kitchen put out a good product.
