Went there a couple weeks ago for a business lunch and am catching-up on my reviews. I have eaten at this location many times and have never had a bad meal. It seems like the portions have gotten smaller though. It is always jammed for lunch but usually you are seated quickly.  The food is good and I especially like the pica de gallo (salsa).  The fact that they have been in business for so many years shows that they know what they are doing.  The prices are very reasonable.
