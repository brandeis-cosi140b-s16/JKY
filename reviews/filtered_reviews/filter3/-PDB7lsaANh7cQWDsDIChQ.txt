Cabo fish taco has pretty good food, with a fairly unique and satisfying menu. A decent selection of drinks that aren't going to blow you out of the water (price wise) and are clearly segmented into tequila qualities etc.

But really, truly, and honestly, the noise level at this place is OUT OF CONTROL. There's no other way to put it. You can be at a 2 person table and not hear a single word your date it saying. I can't even imagine what  a 6 person table is like.

Service was fast and very friendly. I have no idea how our server even heard me over the roaring but our orders came out fresh and correct.

The food's a 4, maybe a 4.25, but the experience is a 2 at best. I don't go to a restaurant to sit in silence because conversation is totally futile. The place seems popular enough but how people get past the maximum volume jimmy buffet + atrocious acoustics I will never understand.
