I think we may have gone on an off day or something.  It was a  Saturday night.  Wasn't very happening.  Not a lot of people and the restaurant was very cold for some reason. It was one of those nights where it was too cold to sit outside, but the restaurant was freezing inside as well. 

On the upside, we had a group of 8 people and they were easily able to accommodate us.  The food was fantastic and the drinks were great.  They were very nice to make special vegetarian dishes for a couple of the veggies in the group.  Another plus is that its next door to the whiskey bar (which is awesome) and so they actually brought us drinks from there since that where we had started out.
