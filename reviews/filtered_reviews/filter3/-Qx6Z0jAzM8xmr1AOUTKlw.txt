I came to Sand Bar for dinner with my boyfriend and his family while we were visiting Phoenix. I love mexican food so any type of mexican restaurant & bar is perfect in my book...well except for Chevys ;) 

They were still doing HH deals when we got there so we got our drinks with the HH prices...score! We also had chips & salsa and also chips & guacamole for starters. They gave us two types of salsa - pico de gallo and chile verde - both were pretty good and the chips were crisp. The guacamole was just okay to me, it seemed like it came from a box...disappointing!

For dinner, I ordered the carne asada tacos. I was expecting it to have some cheese and a salsa on top but it was just three tacos with carne asada and some shredded lettuce in the middle...no toppings! I ended up using the salsa that we got with the chips. The tacos were pretty good, not great, and I felt like they were missing something. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food; my boyfriend had the mexican cobb salad which was pretty good! His family also shared the vegetarian fajitas which looked so good...wish I ordered that!

Service was okay - our server checked on us every once in awhile but she did make sure that our water was refilled and asked if we needed drinks every now and then. Our food came out in a timely manner. 

Overall, Sand Bar is just okay in my book. Nothing was particularly outstanding but I wouldn't rule out this place next time I'm in Phoenix.
