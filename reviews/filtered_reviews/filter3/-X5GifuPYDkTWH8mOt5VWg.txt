Can I just say that giving star ratings gives me headaches? Like I don't know how many stars they deserve! There should be like an alternative rating.. Like love it, like it, gotta try it?! Lol

I'm not sure what happened, but I'm going to have to say that my friends over hyped this place for me. I went with my friend Ryan, and let me tell you know that Ryan is very particular with food. He's a hospitality major, so customer service is also on Ryan's priority list. 

Tacos were okay. Don't get al pastor/adobada. Don't waste your time. It's nasty. A good side was that there carnitas is on point. Try it on a mula (quesadilla like with extra goodies inside and your choice of meat!) $4 but pretty tasty. 

Okay.. Biggest disappointment.. The vampiro. It was supposed to be the deal breaker from the recommendations I got. Yeah, no. Totally burnt tasting. Why? Cause they burnt it! 

Ryan and I were thinking.. Maybe it was an off day..? But then we thought, tacos el Gordo doesn't have off days. So we decided it was their fault, in which it rightly is. 

Oh, the salsa bar is pretty sweet. One problem. No labels. Thanks for the mystery taste adventure, but if someone is allergic to one of those sauces .. It won't look good later... Unless you're bored or don't have enough gas to get to tacos el Gordo.. Then walk or take the bus.. Skip this place if possible!
