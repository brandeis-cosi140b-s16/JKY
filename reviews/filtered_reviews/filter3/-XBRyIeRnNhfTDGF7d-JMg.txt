cool place to go dancing. 
 we usually go on Saturdays for Latin nights, and it usually pretty fun.
only reason i am even giving three stars is for the music and the DJ keeping the energy levels up. If it wasn't for that id probably give this place no stars. Biggest reason is the bartenders. The bartenders on the bottom level suck. Specially the older guy closest to the entrance.Guy is rude and you can tell he hates being there.
