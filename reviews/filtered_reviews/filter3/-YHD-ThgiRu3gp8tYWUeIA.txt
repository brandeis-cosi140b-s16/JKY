I would give this place 3.5 stars.  If you are at the Mandalay and in the mood for Mexican, this is the place to go.  My favorite thing is the chips and salsa.  they bring out 3 different types of homemade salsa -- the green one was my personal favorite.  They are all mild, but you can ask them for a spicer one they have in the back.  I ordered beef taquitos.  they were good, but loved the black beans and rice that came with the meal.  I would definitely come back, but feel its a bit pricey for what you get.
