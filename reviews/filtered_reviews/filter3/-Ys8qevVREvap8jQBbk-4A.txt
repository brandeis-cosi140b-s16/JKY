The good thing about this place is that it's somehow off the beaten path, despite being in the Mandalay Bay. And the food is solid. I had a steak salad and it was very flavorful, although they did dress the salad up a bit too much. If I have a salad the next time I go back (and I will), I'll be sure to ask for the dressing on the side. Also, the chips are yummy, chunky, made fresh in the back type chips, which is always a bonus.
