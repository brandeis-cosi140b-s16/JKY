I wasn't really impressed by this "Mexican" restaurant. It seemed less mexican and more like a fusion of Mexican and American dishes. I went with a group of friends one evening and it seemed like a meat market night club. The service was shoddy at best. Our drinks didn't make it to the table until we had been seated for 20 minutes. I am a huge guacamole fan, and never thought I could go wrong ordering it, but it wasn't good at all. I had the fajitas, which were completely void of flavor. The best part of this place was the decor, which was distracted by the "club scene" and loud atmosphere. If you like that type of thing, and stick to ordering drinks, this place might be good for you.
