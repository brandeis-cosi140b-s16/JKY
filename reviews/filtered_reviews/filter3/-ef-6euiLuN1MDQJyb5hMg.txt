I've visited this spot a few times that I've been in Vegas. It's in a really great location right on the strip, and there's convenient parking around it. For what it offers, it's not a bad spot to grab a drink, socialize, and people watch!

Right off the bat, this place draws you in, as it looks great, and very inviting from the street. It has several levels, and on nice days, the front is opened to the strip. When you walk in, the interior design and decoration is impressive, and the lighting is just right.

The service I've received here is OK. Nothing special, but I don't think that's their focus. This place gets very busy, and they're concerned with getting people through quickly and efficiently. I haven't had a bad experience with this, though.

The food, to me, is good. I always get the fajitas with lettuce roll-ups instead of tortillas. I like the presentation and the sides they serve with it. I haven't experienced a bad meal here. It's nothing incredible or creative, but it is a good, solid meal. 

The price is pretty high for this kind of place. You're paying for their high overhead, and the drinks are also very pricey. It is Vegas, however...and you're going to have to pay to play!

Not bad, overall. I would go back here again, but I wouldn't bring a date here for dinner. It's the kind of place you stop with your buddies to have a few drinks and a meal before you continue with your day.
