Came here with half the group from poppy den brunch, for some margaritas. Was told they were great, and $8!!!!  The place is so sleek. I was very impressed  with the decor. We sat at the round table right across from the bar. We ordered the house margaritas. Before I say I didn't like them, (I didn't), let me explain.  Hussongs, in Mandalay bay, makes the best margaritas......ever! Simple simple recipe. Fresh squeezed lime juice, homemade simple syrup, gold tequilla and grand mariner floater. That's it. I make it at home and it's outstanding. Nooooooow, when I go out and want to have a rita, they are always lacking. We were lucky enough to get there 10 minutes before their $2 mimosa brunch special ended. We had 2 of those and they were good. The margarita??? Eeehhh. The first, one, I had to send back, was so incredibly sweet. The replacement was better. We didn't eat anything so I'm not sure how the food is. Service was good. I'd go back and try the brunch special, oh, and some mimosas too!
