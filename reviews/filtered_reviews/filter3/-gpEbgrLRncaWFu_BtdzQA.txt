Disappointed, especially after reading reviews. Spent $18 for carne asada fries and taco plate. Expected full size foam container and got HALF for fries. Couldn't taste the meat too much cheese sauce, that one my fault, should have asked for one scoop. Taco plate, one scoop rice and beans, expected more, though beans were really good. Would i come back, maybe but not go out of my way to do so. Onr more thing seating outaide, hips hurt because metal seats meant for size 7 and under!
