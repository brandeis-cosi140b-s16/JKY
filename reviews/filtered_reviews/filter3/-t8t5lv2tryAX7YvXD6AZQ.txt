We came here for dinner during happy hour and sat in the cantina.
We ordered way to much food.
I ate the burritos which only came with beans and they where cold. They where ok for being beans only.
I also got cheese crisp which you cant find in Cali and it was pretty good.
This place gets crazy hectic and you should plan on waiting to get in for awhile.
