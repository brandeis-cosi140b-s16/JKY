Food was decent. Some items were better than others. Milanesa was a little soggy and bland. The cheese in the enchiladas wasn't melted all the way. Guacamole was delicious and made to order at the table. Steak and lobster was also very well-prepared. The sauce that was used for the birria was a little over-whelming, but the meat was very tender and flavorful. Our server, Erick, was excellent. Very friendly, welcoming, and attentive. Overall, I would eat here again.
