My first time here wasn't stellar.  But I decided to give it a second shot because I have heard great things about it.  My second time wasn't much better.

This time, we were seated right away and our waiter immediately came over.  He was polite, and got us water and let us look over the menus.  We ordered the chicken nachos to start, and tacos for an entree (polo & their specialty ones).  The nachos were big enough for two, and really loaded and tasted good.  We polished them off pretty quickly.  Then our entrees came out, and our small two seater table was suddenly crowded.  No one - not the food runner, nor our server who walked by us three times - thought to take away the big empty platter from the middle of our table.  

We had just started in on our tacos when the waiter finally came back to the table - but not to ask if we were okay, give us more water, or take away the platter - to hand us the check.  Seriously?  We hadn't even gotten to our second out of three tacos yet, and you're handing us the check?  We had wanted dessert, but obviously he was in a rush to get us out of there for some reason.  It wasn't even busy in there, nor are we people that linger unusually long (dinner from start to finish is a 45 minute to an hour long affair.  We sit, order, eat, pay and leave).  

We ate our food, and the waiter came by twice to ask if the check was ready yet, which it wasn't.  And he looked slightly annoyed when I asked for a to-go box.  With annoyance, we finally paid and got our asses out of there.  

I'll probably go one more time, as I do have a gift certificate to the place, but if the third time is a failure - they lost themselves a regular paying local and anyone whom comes into town and asks us where to go for dinner.
