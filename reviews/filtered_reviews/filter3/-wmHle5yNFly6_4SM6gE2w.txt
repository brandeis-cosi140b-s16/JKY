Pretty good. Pretty cheap. I would recommend trying their queso or guacamole and a few tacos (my favorite is the shredded beef). The hot sauce is really hot, so be careful if you have a sensitive stomach.

Fuzzy's reminds me of home because I grew up in Dallas and ate Fuzzy's when it started getting really good. It isn't the best I've ever had, but if you need a quick, cheap, fairly tasty meal, this is a good place to try.
