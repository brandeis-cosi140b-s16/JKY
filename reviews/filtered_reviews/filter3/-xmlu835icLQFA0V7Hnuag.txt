Trendy, yet good food. The soups are amazing! As for the line, well...good food but nothing to rave over. The one thing that killed it for me was them being skimpy on the sauces. Enchiladas should drown in flavorful sauces but this place is very tight on their pour. Their so wonderful soups are not advertised on the chalkboard (don't understand that since their tag line is: Enchiladas & Soup.)
Overall, not a bad place, but wouldn't recommend it or take my out-town-friends there.
