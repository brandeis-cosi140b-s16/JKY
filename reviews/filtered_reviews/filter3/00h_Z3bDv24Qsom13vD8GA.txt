Good Americanized Mexican food. Some of the best nachos in Pittsburgh (my boyfriend and I LOVE our nachos)! It's hard not to fill up on the free (bottomless) chips and salsa. We would usually split an order of the nachos and be comfortably satisfied. You will definitely have leftovers if you get an appetizer and entrees. Big portions, average entrees, decent drinks (margaritas).
