I had heard so many great reviews about this place so we took my mother-in-law there for her birthday. Honestly, it was good but not what I was expecting based on the reviews I had heard. They brought out free fried ice-cream for my mother-in-law's birthday, which was nice. It was average Mexican food and average service. There wasn't anything that set it aside from any other average Mexican Restaurant. I can't say anything bad about it but I likely won't go there again.
