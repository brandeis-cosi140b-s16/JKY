This restaurant located inside the MGM Grand Hotel has a pretty good Mexican food, however if you're looking for the cheap eats you may get sticker shock or possibly even going into a coma, when you see what they charge at this place. After a long discussion with my wife we ended up splitting a combination appetizer plate 30 bucks! You would think you get a pretty hefty portion of food for the price tag, WRONG. The quality of food however was very good and only ordering and appetizers left room for a dessert we saw that looked interesting a fresh blueberry bread pudding. After ordering our dessert the manager ended up coming by to let us know they were out. The strange thing was it was on their nightly dinner special printed menu, I guess someone forgot to make it. He was very apologetic and bought us another great dessert in its place. Overall the food and service were excellent. However, keep in mind if you're going in for entr√©es and drinks in this restaurant you'll be easily be at $50 per person. That's a lot of tacos off one of the trucks in Nashville.
