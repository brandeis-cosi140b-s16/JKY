I was always curious what kind of restaurant this was because of their cool looking art work in front. This restaurant is a fusion of Chinese and Mexican. My girlfriends and I decided to get some tacos to go. I ordered a carnita and a pollo a la parrilla taco. The tacos are really small but it came in these cute brown to go boxes. The carnita would definitely have to be my favorite out of the two. It comes with braised baby pork, pork rinds, and spicy  salsa verde cruda. YUM! Not sure if I want to come back here again since it gave me a stomach ache afterwards. :(
