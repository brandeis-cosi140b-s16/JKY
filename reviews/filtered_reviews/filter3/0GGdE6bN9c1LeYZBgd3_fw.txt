The chicken burrito (we substituted red with green sauce) was exceptional. We sat in the lower level and the atmosphere did not have much character-- chainlike. We have frequented Z'tejas since early days in Austin. 

The cornbread was bland in our opinion, and as we looked at other tables, it was not favored by several guests.

The shrimp cilantro pesto appetizer was delicious. 

Service was great, I would rate a 3.5
