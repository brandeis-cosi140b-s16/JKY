I've been here many times throughout my pre-yelping days. 

True and true, the food is awesome, as always. 

Today , the service was pretty bad. A lot of annoying little mistakes mostly by the seemingly undertrained youngsters on the staff. I could go through the mistakes one by one, but that isn't really necessary. It is simply a matter of finding employees who not only are good at providing good service but truly desire to give good service. 

The saving grace. Juan Carlos came in and the service level shot through the roof. He must have been on break or something. If all the service personnel offered his level of professionalism, they'd have a world class place here.
