I really do like coming to Baja Joe's. You can't beat the ceviche. It is the best! The only bummer is the extremely loud mariachi music. I think that is what they play themselves off as. Weird to see them drinking beer and playing crazy loud off key music. Hard  to watch and hard to listen.  Definitely can't hear the people you are with.  If you love the food, call ahead to make sure no mariachi band is playing. The food is worth it.
