Was in Phoenix for a weekend seeing two spring training ballgames.  Saw this highly rated on Yelp so went over there.  I am a taco joint junkie anad have been to many all over the country, but would not go back here, unless I were in the neighborhood and were super hungry, or somehow desperate.  Here's an itemization:

PROS
 - Really excellent staff;  super attentive, super caring.
 - Cans of pop are only 75 cents.
 - You can eat inside or outside.
 - The thick taco was interesting and almost satisfying.

CONS
 -  The flavor accents for the taco, thick taco, and tamale I had were completely bland, completely forgettable.
 - The two small parsings of salsa in little plastic containers were completely bland, completely forgettable.

This place has a classy looking menu board, some classy staff, and some utterly indescript food.

Next day went to a Mexican Seafood place on 16th (also a top rating on Yelp), and now it makes me very much regret that I chose to spend stomach-space here.   (Though I didn't have the fish tacos at Atoyac, and maybe that would have made things different?)
