Good place to go if you need to save money and want a cheap breakfast. They have a breakfast special for $3.95 before noon.

Service - We were seated immediately. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. 

Food - We didn't end up taking advantage of the $3.95 breakfast special. I ordered the chilaquiles con huevos. My boyfriend ordered the burrito ranchero. We also ordered coffee and hot chocolate with kahlua. The food was ok, nothing special. 

Location - Planet Hollywood in the Miracle Mile shops.

Price - The bill was under $25. In my opinion this is a great price for Vegas.
