I just moved to Pittsburgh from South Carolina and to call this Mexican is not so true. It's more tex-mex. 

 I'm going to preface this by saying that I have a food allergy to avocado. I know, it sucks for me but it will also suck for you if you try to eat here because everything has avocado in it and they won't/can't take it out for you. That's what makes it tex mex. 

Real Mexican is not completely covered in avocado.

The ambiance was lovely. They have a really nice out door seating section and the white wine sangria was tasty. Great place to go and have dinner with a group of friends if you're looking for a chill and relaxing evening.
