Interesting little spot with good margaritas. Hipster Heaven.

Cool interior and a a cool crowd. They do margaritas by the pitcher or individually in mason jars - I give them a B+

We walked down to try it because a friend had been to the one in Cincinnati and really liked it. My first impression was that it was way too crowded for the amount of space inside and extremely loud. It has picnic tables, barrel tables and some cute booths. I liked the garage style doors that open to the street - that was my favorite feature.

The specialty drinks were few - i usually have to try specialty cocktails wherever I go, but both of the choices on the menu were heavy duty liquor.. so i skipped that. I can't handle bourbon or whiskey... :-/

We had to wait about an hour at one of their standing bars and we had some chips and guac. The guac was pretty fresh - I give that an A - the one item I give an A+ is the cheese with Chorizo - that was awesome!

They serve tacos Ã€ la carte and that seems to be what their "thing" is - the tacos are mock street-style (I say mock because they don't taste anything like street tacos, but then again, i am from Los Angeles... so take that with a sprig of cilantro) They weren't bad - they just weren't really authentic in any way. I had a few different kinds... just to be sure :) 

I wasn't really happy with the wait considering how long it took them to re-seat empty tables and to wait on tables that were already seated - and they have a large empty area near the front door/bar that could accommodate about 3 or 4, 2 tops.. that could have alleviated some of the back up of people mashed together in the walk areas.

The server we finally got when we were seated was extremely MEH - we joked with her and she acted like we were annoying her by being silly or humorous. Maybe she was just tired... but hey - so were we after standing for an hour - waiting for a table.

I might be back.. not sure...
