I was a little underwhelmed by this place. I went on a recommendation from a blogger I normally trust. I had the carne asada and it was tough and not very flavorful. The saving grace was the refried beans and the tortilla was probably the best tortilla I have ever had. I would go back but would likely only order a big bowl of refried beans and some tortillas.
