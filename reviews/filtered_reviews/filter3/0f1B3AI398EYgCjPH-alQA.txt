This was our first meal out in Vegas, a bit hung over and sleepy.  The sign of BOGO margaritas is what really pulled us in.

They had a live mariachi band  which was kinda cool, but also loud, annoying, and kind of puts you on the spot to have to 'buy' a request.

The BOGO margaritas didn't include any of the non-standard ones, I was allured by several of the flavors, and had to pay the whopping $12 to get something a little tasty.

Chorizo Queso is probably one of our favorite foods ever, and what we ordered (at a hefty price) was chorizo, in a small dish of melted shredded cheese.  It didn't spread, dip, and was a chewy mess really by the time it got to us.

The menu was ok; I felt they tried a little too hard to be fancy/different, without actually pulling off any spectacular flavors.

It ended up being a very expensive meal, and we were not really impressed.
