I have been dying to try this place because of all the great reviews! I finally made it in for lunch. The lunch rush must of ended because all the items were not replenished. I usually like my burrito with double rice (rice was okay) no beans and she only gave me a scoop of rice. I wanted to try the green chili beef and only gave me a 1/4 cup serving of it since she had to measure it with a spoon. I'm reading all these awesome reviews about a huge burrito and I felt like I just got scammed. The worst was their tortilla. It tasted like rubber and not fresh. I guess I'll have to try them again on their street tacos instead of their burritos.
