This is basically a one or two star dive that gets 4 food stars for an extensive menu dotted with quirky vegetarian options rarely seen on a Mexican menu.  Several dishes feature calabacitas (zucchini), corn, cabbage,etc. - including a calabacitas stroganoff type dish over a bed of egg noodles (instead of spanish rice), which was filling and tasty.  I'm not vegetarian - I just think it's different and interesting. The salsa is also unusually good. 

Our service has been below average more than once and the atmosphere inside can be quite dark and dreary. Once, a guy in the front of the parking lot was trying to sell his shotgun in broad daylight.  I dont say that to imply any sense of danger as to convey the marginal Sunnyslope surroundings that might offend certain sensibilities.  

I'm glad I tried Via Delosantos.  We still joke about the shotgun, and the menu's a kick. But I dont plan on returning anytime soon...not unless someone puts a gun to my head
