The good: The selection here for tacos and nachos is pretty great. I loved the bacon wrapped jalapeños with cream cheese. So darn good! Make sure you try the Fireball Scorpion Shots! The service was fine.

The bad: If you wanna pay a lot, come here. Three orders of nachos, 2 cokes and two lunch special tacos plus that wrapped jalapeño equalled $76. Sorry, overpriced for what you get.
