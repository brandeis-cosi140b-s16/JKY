Service is great, no denying that but the food is so mediocre I cringed while eating my tacos, which is their supposed specialty. I will say though, their tortillas are fresh and taste great with a good texture as they don't get soggy and blow out the bottom. Anyway, I had the fish taco, pork adobaba, and carnitas. The fish to batter ratio was a little weak and the batter seemed to take up more space in the shell than the fish itself and the taste didn't meet my expectation of freshness. The adobaba and carnitas could've been the same taco as far as I was concerned. They were probably the same meat, which had the texture of pulled pork, but the adobaba had a sauce that resembled in look and taste as a failed attempt at tex mex BBQ sauce (although tex-mex is a failed attempt at cuisine, imho). I wasn't a fan as you might imagine. My friend ordered vegetable enchiladas and they were much better than I was expecting, decent red and green enchilada sauce, oaxacan cheese and a nice array of vegetables. Margaritas are good, $5 pitchers of beer before 5:00 everyday, free chips and salsa great service just lacking in the authenticity or even just a little flare in the food department. Probably won't go back. In fact, So cal tacos across the street is twice as good I'd say.
