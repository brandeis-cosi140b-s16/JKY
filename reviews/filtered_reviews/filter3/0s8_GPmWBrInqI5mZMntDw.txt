This is a tough review to write. I was just here three weeks ago, and I loved the concept and the edgy decor and sttting on benches with people that seemed to either have just come back from the Cosmo pool or were on their way to a club. But you pay big time for the coolness vibe. You may be wearing board shorts and sitting next to a couple wearing shades indoors, but you pay like you're in an expensive joint. When the waiter hands you that collectable little aluminum bottle of Diet Coke, you have just learned that refills aren't going to be free. Get ready for lIttle dinky mini-soft tacos and little everything, all tasty, but again, you end up paying. I think the Mexican side of the menu is better and more fun than the Chinese attempt at things. So if you can get past the prices and a bit of pretentiousness in how they present themselves, the food ends up being a good memory. See what I meant? This was a hard review to write.
