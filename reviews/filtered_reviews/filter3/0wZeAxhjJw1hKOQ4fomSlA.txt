Once upon a time Chi-Chi's had the Seafood Enchilada, it had a creamy sherry sauce.  Well, when the better half and I stopped into Border Grill during a trip to MMS they had a Seafood Enchilada with a creamy sherry sauce.

I hoped against hope that it was the same thing.

Unfortunately it was 35 dollars. And it wasn't the same.

I grant you this is entirely my expectations vs. reality.  But because it wasn't what I wanted it to be, I didn't really care for it. So it felt like 35 dollars wasted.  The better half got the Quesadillas which WERE really good. So she was happy.

My other frustration is the Las Vegas Mexican restaurant trick of asking if you want "Fresh Guacamole". This is code for "Would you like to pay 9 more dollars?"  They rarely inform you it's an extra cost and they ask so nicely. Don't be fooled.  Fortunately I knew from a previous bad experience.

The chips and salsa were very good, and our waiter was excellent.  When I explained the Chi-Chis story he said "What's Chi-Chi's".  (Now I feel old!)

Overall, I can't say it was bad, and as long as you don't mind the somewhat high cost of the Mexican food. I would absolutely come back for the Quesadillas
