food is good AZ style Mexican food. i have been there 3 times,the food was better then lets say Filberto's or someburros down the street. i do have to say 1 time i stood there for 15 20 mins to pick up my food. but 1 time i took my wife n kids there were fast and did not take much time to sit and eat. so its so so there is better and much worse around!
