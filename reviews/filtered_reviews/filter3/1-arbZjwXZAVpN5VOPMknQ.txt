If I could steal the guacomole, I would! If I could take home a gallon of margaritas, I would! The staff I quirky but efficient. They are oddballs, but knowledgeable. We have had one poor night, but the managers did everything in their power to correct the situation and since then, perfection! Samantha needs to be there more, I guess that is our only complaint. Well, that and sometimes the chips are too salty!
