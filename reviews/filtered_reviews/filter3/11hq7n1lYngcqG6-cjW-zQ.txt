The decor here is pretty neat...I like that a lot. 

I would describe the service as attentive. I felt bad for our waiter, though....I think he was new. he brought us our chips/dip and then 5 minutes later brought another one. He saw the one on our table, and commented on how someone must've beaten him to it (he was being serious). haha!! He had a few other issues too....but a really nice person and very attentive - he tried hard.

The reason for the 3 stars is the food - it was average at best. I thought the relleno was okay, but the enchiladas and tamales were bland. We had cabernet - it was not very good... You know your taste buds are in for a treat when you order a wine that is served in a bottle with a screw top, right?.... their wine menu could use an overhaul, in my opinion.

BUT... i recognize that it is a Mexican restaurant and wine is not the specialty.

We probably won't go back...there are much tastier places in the same area.
