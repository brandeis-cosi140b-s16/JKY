Got the orange duck and it was very close to 4 stars. My only complaint is the duck was a bit fatty and tough. The salsa on top was fresh and tasted a bit like lime. The rice was fluffy, light and very fresh as well. The black beans on the side was so so; not bad or good. The guacamole is made in front of you; very fresh. The only reason I didn't give this place 4 stars is the duck could have been less fatty.  I would come here again.
