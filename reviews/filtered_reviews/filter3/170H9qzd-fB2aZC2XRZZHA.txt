I'm surprised I hadn't already reviewed this joint. 

After seeing Inception last night, we were gonna hit up a thai place for dinner, but they were closed so we resorted to Macayo's. The guys at the front were charming (as a "bouncer" can be) and we went inside to the restaurant. After standing around awkwardly for a few minutes waiting for someone to notice us...a guy that was busing tables came over and told us to have a seat anywhere. 

After a few minutes, we got our menus and placed an order. Service was kind of "iffy", as we had a few different guys bring our drinks/app/entrees. The taquitos app was tasty, and when our server brought out my rather naked looking burrito, he asked if I wanted any sauce on it which was nice of him. 

Either way, it wasn't an amazing experience, but not one that would stop me from coming back.
