If you go to cabo and see girls dancing on bars, poles, and whomever, it's a cool place...you go to San Felipe Cantina and see the same thing people turn a different tune - and since I like Cabo.....  I like the place...it's wierd that it is in a family style mall and should be a stand aloneplace but all in all it's good times.  The food is good, tastes fresh and perfect for afternoon style baja mexican.  There are way better mexican joints, there are a lot of worse ones too, this little spring break re-creation is a nice break and can give you some good times.   Buffalo wings, hot, not very meaty but a whole hell of em, they were good.  Shrimp cocktail baja style was good and fresh and tasted like shrimp in my bloody mary.  Oyster shooters...HUGE ASS OYSTERS....almost too big to shoot, get stuck in your throat on the way down, about 2 seconds from almost hurling because it was stuck, but i man'ed up and did it.   The Hawaiian fish, eh, okay thought it would be better.   The grilled fish tacos were really good, a little too much water on the bottom of my plate made my tacos fall apart but i'm hoping that was from washing the cabbage before adding it on.  All in all a decent joint -- think Senior Frogs/The Office/Squid Roe/ meets On the Border.  Also 1/2 price drinks and appetizers from 4-7pm
