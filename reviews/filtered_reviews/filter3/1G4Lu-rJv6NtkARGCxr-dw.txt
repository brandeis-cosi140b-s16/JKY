2nd stop on the dine around. 

Our group gave them a 3.25, which I'm rounding down to a 3. 

We were seated quickly and ordered a round of the grand canyon margaritas. We were brought chips and salsa, which unfortunately was the best tasting thing we ate at the restaurant. I had the carnitas taco, which was sadly underwhelming. The pork wasn't too flavorful. Jon had the corn crusted calamari. I don't have a calamari palate so I can't rank it against anything, but he said it was just average. The drinks however were BOMB (margarita with cranberry, lime, and prickly pear juice), both frozen and iced. Our server was super sweet and chatted it up with us which was nice. I don't know if I'd make the trip back for dinner, but if I was in the area I'd definitely come back for a margarita and some appetizers.
