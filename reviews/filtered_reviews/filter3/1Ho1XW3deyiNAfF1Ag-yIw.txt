This is a great place if your looking for more of a bar atmosphere than a restaurant. If I was ten years younger and still enjoying cocktails I would rate five star. But, since I'm not I can only give it a three. The tables in the restaurant only accommodate the larger parties-a party of two will find themselves eating at the bar. 
The food is good (not great or unique) I give it 3.5 stars. 
The presentation of the food is nice and service quick.
