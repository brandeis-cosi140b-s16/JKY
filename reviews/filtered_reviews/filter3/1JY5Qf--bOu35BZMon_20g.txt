In retrospect, I would come again not for the food but for the scene.  This sexy gothic lair is apparently very popular with the ladies.  I wonder now if my tastes are more aligned with bachelorette partygoers....

The much raved table side guacamole is fine and fresh but not quite as memorable as I would have hoped.  The papaya salad was downright sad.  The short rib had a great texture and sprung when you could find a pepper to pair it with.  The chimichurri hangar steak was good but very standard for what you would find at any Argentinean restaurant.

During this -- my second -- Scottsdale trip, I tried as many guacamole dishes and tequilas as possible in four days.  The reposado flight here had a lot of turbulence.  The Sol de Mexico and Corralejo were both good; but the Milagro and Maestro tequilas were extremely harsh, reminding me of regrettable nightclubs in Tijuana offering shots from Dixie cups . . . not what I would expect for $6.00 a shot.

But the design, guests, and waitresses are all beautiful.  The hostesses are charming and accommodating.  I think the overall feel is just trendy fun.
