Nice place not great. Salsa was weak packed absolutely no punch. Shared a 1lb plate with steak and chicken steak was good chicken was while not dry wasn't really seasoned at all, meat is supposed to be mesquite grilled but couldn't detect any in any if the meats. Sever was good but seemed to be going through the motions as a veteran server, no extra attention or unnecessary distractions. Probably not return unless in the area will get steak not chicken.
