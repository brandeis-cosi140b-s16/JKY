I was really in the mood for some Mexican food so we went by Los Taquitos. It's very much a hole-in-the-wall place and based on the Yelp reviews, I had high expectations. We walked up to the counter & the cashier was highly distracted. After repeating my order about 4 or 5 times, she finally put it in.

I got the shrimp tacos with rice & beans. My date got three of the street tacos - asada, pollo, & carnitas with rice & beans. He enjoyed them but said they were not spectacular. The shrimp taco had potential to be really good as it had the well-seasoned shrimp, rice, and sour cream, but there were way too many jalape√±os in it. I like food that has a kick but this was almost inedible. I did my best to pick them out and added the beans to tone down the heat. I'm not sure if I just got the wrong thing or what but it wasn't too great of an experience.
