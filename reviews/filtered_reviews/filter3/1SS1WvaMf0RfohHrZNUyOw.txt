I do come here somewhat often but I've had hit or miss service everytime. My favorite dish is the camarones a la diabla. The server claimed that the dish was spicy but it wasn't at all. The sauce had a really good flavor though despite its lack of heat. I did try the vegetable fajitas once and they weren't very impressive. It was just a mess of vegetables cooked and served. The horchata is a little on the sweet side so I recommend a glass of water too. The fried ice cream isn't bad either. Then again, when is anything fried ever bad tasting?
