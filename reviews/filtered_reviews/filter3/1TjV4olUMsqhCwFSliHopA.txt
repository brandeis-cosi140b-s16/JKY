This place was recommended by some good friends. I have to say, good service, decent food and a good margarita. Nothing spectacular, but good. A little pricey for the quality though. The main thing that upset me was, the "fried ice cream". We all know what fried ice cream is and when you're served a ball of ice cream rolled in soggy corn flakes... WTH... Not impressed. And they still charged me 7.99 after I complained about it. So, good service, decent food and drink, laughable dessert.
