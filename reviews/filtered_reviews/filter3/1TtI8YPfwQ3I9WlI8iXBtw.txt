I don't know what's happened to Mexican food in America.... 

I used to eat at on the border a lot when I was in North Carolina and Georgia on the East Coast. I think there's only one or two in all of Arizona

I decided to go back and give it another shot... Because I remembered I love the salsa in the queso of dip.

The salsa is still awesome... But that cheese dip is like a goopy mess. 

1) salsa is great

2) cheese dip is not good at all anymore.  Actually it's better if you buy it in the grocery store in the jar and then heated yourself. It tasted better than what they serve supposedly fresh

3) the fish tacos were mediocre at best... They fried the fish they didn't offer a grilled option

It's American Mexican food... So it's worth three stars for what it is. But don't text suspect exceptional food. It's also a chain restaurant... However the food here was better than some local Mexican restaurants I've been to
