This place has a great happy hour but when we went there the waitress did not advertise it to us at all, we had to ask her about it. I hate that. If you have a happy hour, you shouldnt try to hide the fact that you have it. Let customers know!! It makes them happy!! DUH!!!
The food was good. Margaritas were yummy. The atmosphere was great, I loved the decor.
