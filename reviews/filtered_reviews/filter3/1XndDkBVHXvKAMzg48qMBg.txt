About 1 year ago this place closed its doors from Firefly Spanish Tapas and re-opened as a Mexican franchise called Nacho Daddy, located next to Village Square off W. Sahara.

I enjoyed the Daddy's Bowl...wild rice, black beans, cabbage, chili garlic sauce, Mexican cheese blends, sour cream and cilantro, with added marinated pork.  This was a decent entree!

Also, tried the Excitement in Enchiladas...1/2 red & 1/2 green sauce... w/ marinated slow roasted pork, served w/ rice and beans.

Chips and salsa were good! Guacamole was just ok and NOT prepared tableside like Lindo Michoac√°n, our favorite Mexican restaurant.

Definitely high quality ingredient and some culinary artistry, but kinda expensive for the portion size.

Open for lunch and dinner til 10 or 11pm.
