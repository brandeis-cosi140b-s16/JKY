Love the atmosphere and ambience. Tequila is top notch. Food leaves much to be desired. Fajitas are good. Sides are awful as is the black beans, rice, and others. Ceviche is poor. They try to be gourmet with dishes unsuccessfully. Just step back and try delicious instead. Service can be very poor at times. Even during  slow periods of time.
