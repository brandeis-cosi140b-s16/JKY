This was my last night in Vegas and we came here for dinner since we stayed in Mandalay Bay. I would give this restaurant 3.5 stars. 

Mexican food is my favorite and I was really excited after my friend said it was really good. Our waitress was great. She was very knowledgeable and served us chips and salsa quickly. The chips were very fresh and warm. The salsa Verde was amazeballs. I enjoyed the chips and salsa more than my meal. I ordered the enchiladas, two steak and one chicken. Enchiladas are my go to Mexican food dish and it is really hard to mess the dish up so it was not bad, but it was not anything spectacular. 

I will probably return on my next trip and try a different dish and a margarita. The menu had tons of different types of margaritas.
