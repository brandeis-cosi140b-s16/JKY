I ate at Diablo's with my wife in November of 2015, and we both found our dining experience average to lacking.

Diablo's is located on the strip attached to the Monte Carlo restaurant.

The decor is trendy Mexican and the atmosphere is a party loud and fun.  We found the wait staff to all be friendly and helpful.

A pitcher of margaritas is $40, but they were made from scratch with lots of alcohol.  They tasted great, so they were worth the money.

The food is another story.  First of all they don't serve chips and salsa unless you want to pay ($6) for them.  What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn't offer free chips and salsa to make you thirsty for more margaritas?

We found the food tasted good, but the portions were very small especially considering the high prices you'll pay.  Most of the entree items have an additional charge if you want rice and beans.  Again, why?  They charge so much, they should include the items that are traditionally included.

This is my second negative Strip Mexican restaurant experience (the other being Cabo Wabo), so I've decided to avoid eating Mexican food on the strip.  I'll go off the strip where the prices are lower, the portions are bigger, and they include the chips & salsa.

I will not be eating here again, but I may have a margarita here.
