We like supporting the new local businesses...so here goes. Guess we're use to the giant sized Chipotle burritos, so the regular burritos were on the small size. The carne asada was overall pretty tasty. For a pretty limited menu, we waited awhile for the food. I kept thinking that they should offer a carne asada plate with rice and salsa. Maybe their upcoming new location on 7th Ave will have a bigger menu?!
