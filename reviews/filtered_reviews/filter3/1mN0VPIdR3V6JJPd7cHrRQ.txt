The ambiance is great, this is a beautiful restaurant. However I felt underwhelmed by the food especially considering some of the rave reviews here. We did try the pork belly pibil appetizer I had read about. The pork was wonderfully tender but had little flavor other than the dollop of sauce on top. The mahi mahi tacos were again OK but nothing to write home about. The fried bananas dessert was a tasty standout. Also it may sound silly but the espresso was excellent.
Overall going to The Mission was an enjoyable experience but I don't see much need to return.
