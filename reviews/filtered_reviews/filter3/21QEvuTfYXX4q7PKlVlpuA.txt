The decor defiantely needs some help.  I'm not sure what they are trying to accomplish with the african animal heads on the wall but it is strange.  This place is more suited to be a Rainforest Grill then a Mexican food restaurant. 

The happy hour margaritas are awful.   The taste like a lime Otter Pop and I'm sure they just kind of waved the tequila bottle over the glass for a second or two.

I had the burrito platter with machaca.  They didn't drain the meat so there was quite a bit of liquid but the flavor was good.  The red sauce was okay.  They charged me $2 for a side of sour cream which was ridiculous.  I had the house brewed amber which was okay, nothing special.  

I love the salsa and bean dip they serve with the chips!  The chips are great too.  

We had a huge party and the waitress, Alba, was great.  She gave us all separate checks and and the service was great!
