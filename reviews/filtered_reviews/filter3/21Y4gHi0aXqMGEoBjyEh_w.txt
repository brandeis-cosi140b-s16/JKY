Decent service, good food. However I have to admit seeing all this dust everywhere throughout the restaurant especially on my booth was pretty gross. I'm amazed how this went unnoticed. I took it upon myself to leave a little note. The server saw me and the dust and commented "hahaha yeah there's a lot of dust here." Wooooooow really?
