Decent place to grab seafood tacos.  I was in Charlotte for business and a coworker suggested I come here. 

This restaurant is located in the the NoDa part of Charlotte, a very cute neighborhood that is worth exploring more if I were to ever come back.  Street parking only for this location. Got here 6pm on a Monday and we were seated immediately.  Seems like a cool and chill atmosphere.  They have a full bar as well. 

Once seated, they brought us complimentary chips and corn salsa. From their taco portion of the menu, you can order any two tacos which come with your choice of side dish.  I went with the BBQ Mahi and the beer battered shrimp, with a side of baja rice.  Both were delicious but not too memorable. 

Service was nice, food was OK, but not sure I'd make a beeline to come back to this place if I were back in Charlotte for business.
