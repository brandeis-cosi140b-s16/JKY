I've been to Verde four or five times now.  The first time, I sat at the bar with a couple of friends and had a wonderful experience.  The tequila and mezcal selection is excellent and the cocktails are all very creative and tasty.  The bartenders are all very knowledgeable and have great personalities (especially Allie (sp?)).  On the food end, I enjoyed the guacamole and potato and chorizo tacos (the latter are not currently on the menu).  

My trips for sit-down dinners have been less successful, primarily because of the speed of service and some just okay main courses.  The servers are all quite friendly, but can be difficult to find and service, especially with drinks, can be very slow.  I am all for a leisurely-paced meal, but it is often inconsistently slow (e.g., very long wait for order, including drinks, to be taken; long wait for drinks; long wait for apps; entrees come out immediately after apps).  The tacos are generally quite good and the portion sizes just right.  I have had less success with the other mains.  I have tried the steak, the fish of the day twice, and the vegetable as well as the chicken enchiladas.  All were cooked well, but the flavors just didn't come together for me.  

I'll definitely go back to the bar many times and enjoy some appetizers, but the service will have to be more consistent for me to become a regular table diner.
