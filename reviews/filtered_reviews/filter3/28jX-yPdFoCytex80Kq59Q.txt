My girlfriend and I came here because she insisted that she had to come here for nostalgic reasons. She said that for the price, the food was plentiful and cheap. We, by we I mean me, being typical thrifty Asian(s), I quickly agreed. 

The parking lot is kind of small for a restaurant this size. There is valet there...but I hate shelling out cash for something I can easily do myself. Seeing as there was no parking...I had to get valet. 

The service was fast. We got in there and were seated right away. The place is kind of dark and I almost tripped on a step that was hiding there, heh. Anyways, we were seated in a nice cozy booth. The place was dimly lit to create a more quiet and romantic/intimate atmosphere. Nicely pulled off with a Southwest style decor. I guess they do that because they kind of figure this is Mexican food. It seems the only thing Mexican about the cuisine is the abundant use of Hispanic names in only some of their dishes. I don't really care to be honest, if I wanted Mexican food...I'm sure there's a something-berto fast food place nearby anyways. 

We ordered a bunch of the small plates as per my lady's recommendation. They came probably around 20 minutes later...not bad waiting time I suppose with probably a dozen or two patrons here. Calamari, delicious. Prime rib sliders, delicious. Bruschetta with a bunch of sauces, delicious. We got like one or two more dishes. The only reason why I gave this place three stars was the scallops. They were sooooo salty. Literally, when I bit into it...first thing that came to mind was water. Don't get me wrong, if it wasn't salty it would've been a fine dish and a fine meal for a nice night. However, these scallops were so salty...they made everything else I ate that night salty in flavor. 

I wouldn't mind coming here again and I wouldn't mind recommending this place. I would only advise anybody planning here to be careful with the scallops. I don't know...maybe it was a fluke.
