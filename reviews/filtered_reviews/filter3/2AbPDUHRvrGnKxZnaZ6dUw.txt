Can't say I was impressed with our meal and service. This place is always packed with people, so we forgave the fact that we waited a while for someone to take our drink order. We ordered fish tacos and steak Milanesa. The fried batter on the fish wasn't crunchy. It may have been sitting out on the service window for too long. The steak Milanesa was over fried. Needless to say, we had leftovers and it wasn't because the portions were huge. It was a lack-luster experience. However, I did enjoy my blended mango margarita!
