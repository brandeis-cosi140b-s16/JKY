I hate writing a critical review of Round Corner because I love the vibe of the place, and the drinks are actually really good. Plus, the owner is a nice guy. Unfortunately, the food just doesn't do it for me, and that's the most important aspect.

Of all of the things that I've tried in the handful of times that I've eaten there, I'd say the tamales are the best thing on the menu. They're truly delicious, and the sole thing that I think about when Round Corner is mentioned. The pico and chips are also good. The pico has a real freshness about it, but that's hardly a unique thing to pull off. 

The part that keeps my review of Round Corner from being a totally positive one is the tacos. The first area where the tacos fail - quite literally - is the corn tortillas. I'm impartial on their use of corn over flour tortillas, but the fact that the they use TWO tortillas for each taco and they STILL fall apart almost immediately when you try to pick up your taco is ridiculous. The flavors in the tacos are fairly pedestrian and almost monotonous, but I can't stand being required to use a fork to eat a taco. On the plus side, they're fairly affordable (2 tacos for about $7), but if taco stand/truck-quality tacos are what you're craving you can still enjoy tastier tacos for less from one of those options.

Will I go back? Sure. My complaints aren't deal breakers, by any means, but Round Corner is hardly my first choice when I'm in a taco/mexican food kind of mood.
