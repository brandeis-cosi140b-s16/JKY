Not bad los favoritos. Not bad...
The salsa could use some work. I'm not even sure what I would suggest needs to be changed about it, I just know that it doesn't meet my expectations. 
If I were rating this place solely on their chile relleno. (which is a deal breaker for me when it comes to mexican food) I would give it 1 star. Again something with the sauce and it had a LOT of seeds. (yes I am well aware that chiles have seeds, but I don't want them in every bite!)
BUT. I did give this place 3 stars because I really enjoy their bacon breakfast burrito, which includes potatoes as well as their beef taquitos.
