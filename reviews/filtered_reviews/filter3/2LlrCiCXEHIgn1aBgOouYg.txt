The menu is inspired, the food is tasty, cocktails are boozey. I left feeling somewhat unsatisfied though.

Jb and I went for lunch and each had a bloody mary (it was* okay*) for starters we had chips with salsa and guacamole. Chips were a tad greasy and the accompaniments were good but not extraordinary. My quesadilla and jb's tacos were both delightful. Jb also got a side of grilled green onions which had a nice smoky flavor but I couldn't eat too many at one sitting. All that + 20% tip cost $52.
