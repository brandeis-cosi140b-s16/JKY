I was sooo excited to try this place after hearing all of the hype! Not what I thought it was going to be... Food is alright, nothing to write home about. I had the fried whitefish taco which was decent, but I've had much better. The margs were off though... Didn't even taste like a margarita to be honest and nobody at my table even finished half of theirs. I think there are much better Mexican places in the area.
