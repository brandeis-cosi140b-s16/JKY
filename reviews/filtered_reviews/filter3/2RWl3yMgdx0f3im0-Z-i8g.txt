Love the decor love the service prices were kind of high and the quality was not the best. I ordered the combo with a taco and the taco was over hard and the meat was so hard from being over cooked tastes like chips. Salsa was great. Went for my brother in laws bday dinner they couldn't even sign happy bday. Next time will try another place
