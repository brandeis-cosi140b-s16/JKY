We decided to finally try what seems to be Vegas' favorite Mexican place on a Friday after work.  Lindo was already hoppin' at 6:30, but we seemed to beat the crowd and only had a 10 minute wait for a table.  We were seated at a table in the bar area - between the bar stools and the massive booths they have.  (To be honest the booths look plush and wonderful, but are so large they seem out of scale with this rather small restaurant).

The service was warm and attentive throughout.  Complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip? Check.  All were good - the salsa even a bit hotter than what I expected, which made for an auspicious start!  House margaritas on the rocks with salt made with sweet and sour and Sauza were bright, tangy and not overly sweet - yummy.

Wow - their menu is extensive with all kinds of innovative, tasty sounding dishes like Fillet Relleno -  fish fillet stuffed with seafood and then breaded and fried.  I opted for the Enchiladas de Camaron - gulf shrimp in tortillas with red enchilada sauce.  The combination includes fideo soup - although it's just a simple tomato based soup with vermicelli noodles, I'm a big fan of any restaurant that serves it.  Love me some fideo and this one was good.

The entrees arrived and, after such an exciting stellar start, I was surprised they were a little...well...meh.  The shrimp were cooked nicely inside my enchiladas, but the sauce was kind of tasteless.  Rice and beans were fine, pretty much what you would expect to find in any mexican restaurant.  My whole entree was kind of a plate of bland.

That said, I definitely want to go back - I haven't lost faith, maybe I just didn't make the right choice off of their massive menu.  Mole anyone?
