I'm on this Lenten kick of trying seafood (primarily fish) tacos. I had 2 fish tacos and 1 shrimp taco. The good was that the fish was delicate and tender. They offer onions and jalape√±os on the side if you want (and I recommend).  The flour tortillas were soft and chewy. The not so good (in my opinion) was that there was too much of the crema based sauce on the tacos. I prefer a good salsa instead but it's good to try them as they are intended. Would I come back here- yes. I would like to try other items, but the place was bustling for a Friday evening. A good, friendly crowd.
