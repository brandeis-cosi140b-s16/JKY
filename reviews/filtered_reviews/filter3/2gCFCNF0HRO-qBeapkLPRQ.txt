I would give this place 3.5 stars. Solid place to eat Mexican food. The fresh guacamole was definitely my favorite thing that I ate. Love that you can get a free margarita if you check in on Yelp (valued at $11)!

Nice decor. Good service. I got the chicken enchiladas. They were just okay. Wish I had tried the ceviche bar and stuck with that and the guac.

That part of the Forum Shops seems a bit tucked away, which seems to make this place not as busy. I would go back.
