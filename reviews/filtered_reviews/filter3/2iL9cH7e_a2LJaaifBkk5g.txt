We came here a month ago.  We came right before lunch started.  There was a breakfast buffet going on with only 2 guests inside the restaurant.  Hostess wouldn't sit us until buffet was cleared.  Kind of annoying, but fine, whatever.
As for food, we got the free guacamole by checking in and it was really delicious.  Husband raved about his Pozole soup.  He still raves about it today!  So must be good :)  I THINK i got the carne asado tacos.  It was not memorable at all.  I just remember it drenched in oil and cheese.  I would go back and try other things on the menu though!
