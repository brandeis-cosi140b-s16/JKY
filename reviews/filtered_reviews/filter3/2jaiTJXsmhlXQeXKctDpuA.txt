I love the fact that HH prices are really cheap and the food was decent. I got HH tacos, a margarita and split a cookie dessert with tip and was under $15. Not bad! The ambience reminds me of San Felipe's and Salty Senorita. My friend and I sat outside and was a little loud with all the noise from Mill and the planes coming down. It has a really nice bar though with tv's that can be watched inside and outside. I can see this place popping for night life because when we went for HH, it wasn't very busy. Service was also a bit slow, I remember commenting to my friend about how long it took for us to receive our food. All in all I was glad to have tried it and would probably return.
