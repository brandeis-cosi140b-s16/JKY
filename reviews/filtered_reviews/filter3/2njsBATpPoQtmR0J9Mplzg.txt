Funny place; you'll get mixes of Chinese & Spanish music. Below are my picks from the menu:

Noodles & Soup: Dan Dan Mian (most popular-wheat noodle w/ spicy pork sauce), Swallow a Cloud (wonton soup with bok choy), & Ocean Nest (for seafood lover w/ pan fried noodles).

Dim Sum: Try the When Pig Fly (bbq pork buns) & Traditional Sui Mai (shrimp & pork).
