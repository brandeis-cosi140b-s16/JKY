I have been waiting to try this place and I was a little disappointed. I order the not nachos (Asada) (around 10 bucks) and the flavor was on point,however the temp was not. The meat was almost as cold as the gauc. But in all fairness I didn't complain or ask them to fix it because I didn't have time for all that. Other then that the food flavor was on point and I would try it again during the day next time (I came around midnight)
