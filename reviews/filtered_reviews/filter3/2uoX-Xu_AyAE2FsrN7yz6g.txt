So whenever I go to Dicks Hideaway, Rokerij, or Richardson's someone tell me completely different times of when the kitchens close at each locations. I really don't know what to expect when I go to any three of their  restaurants. There is clearly a lack of communication between these establishments. It's pretty frustrating when I'm trying to grab a late night meal because I don't want to succumb to any late night fast casual's or fast food joints. The only reason why I am giving this review more than one star is because of Connor and the kitchen at the Rokerij. He went above and beyond and made my girlfriend and I a simple side salad plus a side dish when he did not have to. Thank you Connor, we were so hungry and we appreciate your kindness. Give him a raise please.
