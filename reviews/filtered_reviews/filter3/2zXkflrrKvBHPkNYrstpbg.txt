While the food is outstanding, the service needs some serious work!  After taking our orders and receiving our drinks we did not see our waitress until my wife flagged her down (at least 30 minutes later).  We probably would have ordered more drinks, dessert and coffee, but our waitress was covering too many tables and seemed to forget about us!  At a minimum the wait staff should check on you after receiving apps, mains, and offer dessert or coffee.  We did not even receive the basic level of service expected at a restaurant that pretends to be upscale.  Mundo - please train your wait staff to meet the level of excellence coming from your kitchen, your chef deserves better!
