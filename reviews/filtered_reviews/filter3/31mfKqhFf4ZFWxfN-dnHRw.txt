I've been to Vida plenty of times. I'm a lover of all things Mexican. And tequila. And cheese. Anywho... I've had my share of good dishes here and some not so good. Not bad just... ehhh... here's the deal. 

Years ago when the hot spot first opened, I would go constantly simply for the queso fundido. It was a thing with my friend Ray and myself to hit up the Checkers games then walk over to Vida and snag some cheese and drinks. However, sadly, they took the fundido away. Sigh... Vida, feel free to bring that back at any point. Nonetheless they still have queso but it doesn't hold a candle to the fundido. 

If I go for lunch, I always get the ABLT - thats avocado on a BLT. It comes with a cilantro mayo but that's not my thing so I ask them to 86 the mayo, side of honey mustard. The sandwich is light and comes on an almost ciabatta-like bun. 

If I do dinner, I get the crab meat nachos time and time again. Topped with crab meat, melted cheese, mashed black beans and avocado (hi, I'm Nikki and I love avocado). The nachos are individually crafted, piled high on each chip with yummy goodness. 

Last time I went I got the ahi tuna salad. The ahi tuna was cooked mid-rare, absolutely perfect, but the ingredients in the salad didn't seem to jive. This is the ehhh I was talking about earlier. And the cilantro lime dressing left me a bit disappointed. For an appetizer, we had some type of mushroom wraps which I'd say go ahead and skip. 

However, if you have a margarita craving, this is the place to quench your thirst. Variety of styles. A pleathra of tequila choices. And a good number of flavors to choose from.
