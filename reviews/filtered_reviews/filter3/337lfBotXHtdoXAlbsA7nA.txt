Happened to stumble upon this place while hanging out in the NODA District (the artsy part of town) Convinced my date to give this place a try since I was in the mood for Mexican food anyhow, was kinda busy for a Tuesday evening so I figured that must be a good sign that they get regulars to come in. We were seated, given menus and told about the drink specials which were sort of bleh so we stuck with soft drinks. They followed it up with some complimentary corn salsa & chips, thank god they don't charge for it. The taste was very bland and forgettable but still a nice gesture nonetheless. Luckily, they kept their namesake intact because there fish taco's were quite tasty, not a huge portion but certainly filling enough to get your money's worth. I went with the lemon pepper variety while my date had the more traditional version. Service was a bit sluggish, by the time we finished  our meal I had to flag down our waitress to get our check and get out of there. Certainly a good enough place to dine at whenever I'm on that side of town for poetry, but not a place to really go out of your way for in my opinion. Parking is a little scarce usually have to squeeze a spot on the side of the street or a find a lot a block or so away and work your way back up to the location. All in all, hard to find a good authentic fish taco, so if that's what you have a taste for this place certainly caters to that niche.
