I came starving and it was still hours before the Yelp event so came to get something small bite with my mom in law and grammy in law.

They serve chips with salsa and beans and it was pretty decent salsa they give you. I however did not want to stuff myself too much on chips.

The menu is extensive, but wasn't exactly finding what I was looking for in the appetizers- none sounded good and they are the same price as some entrees, so thought I might as well get my favorite thing which chile verde (pork) enchiladas.  Off the "combiaciones mexicanas" menu you can pick a choice of one two three items which come with rice, beans and fideo soup. I just got one item of the chile verde enchilada. It was pretty good actually, the green sauce is a bit tangy which I like and the pork in it was tender. The fideo soup was just OK- it had good flavor, but it was a little cilantro heavy...less cilantro and it was be quite nice actually. I thought the rice was good with my entree (I asked for no beans).  I got a jamaica to drink and their mix is good. I've had it plenty of times in other establishments where it was just way too sweet and had to be cut with water. 

Mom and Gma shared a combiaciones of a cheese enchilada and a chile verde burrito and added a cup of albondigas soup for Grandma. Gma liked her albondigas and it was very generous with the meatballs for a small cup so she wants to come back for when she's feeling like having her favorite soup. Grandma liked the enchilada but the tangy green sauce on the burrito she did not like as much. Mom however agreed with me that the green sauce is quite nice and a favorite for both of us. She was in agreeance with too much cilantro in the fideo, but that it was promising. One set back was that on part of moms half of the enchilada it was lukewarm and cheese wasn't hot and gooey like the rest. 

Service was OK. We were check in on once by a manager. I never got a single refill, but mom got hers once from our server. At that time though everyone was about done eating so I just finished my water instead before leaving. 

I thought what I got was good, but we had some setbacks with no refill for me and a cold spot in moms enchilada. The price isn't too expensive, but it's $10-28 a plate for dinner  with a majority on the upper end of things, around $16-18 which is quite more than some other Mexican sit down establishments. My single enchilada was $11  (a plate of 3 of them was like $16). I'll probably drop in for the lunch specials or try more of the signature dishes for dinner since it's right by work. So far though my impression is that it is a okay spot, but there are definite hole in the wall spots I currently much prefer for price, taste and hospitality.

Bobby from Viva Mercado;

Thanks for a comment back. However I need to point out something that does not make sense. So my receipt for dinner with the combaciones mexicans one item plate dinner with enchilada, rice, beans, fideo was $10.50, not the $8.95 you quoted.

Also on your website it says $10.50 right there on the dinner menu.

And that lunch one item is $9.50.

Just saying, that this is confusing for a customer to have the owner say different prices than the website says and what my receipt told me.

Since I've been there to the time you commented a few days later, did the price drop or something? I doubt it so something doesn't add up right here that needs to be cleared up. 

Sincerely, Jade W.
