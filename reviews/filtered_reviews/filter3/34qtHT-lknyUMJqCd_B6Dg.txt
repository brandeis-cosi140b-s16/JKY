Great margaritas. Nice atmosphere with seating outside around a small pond. Service was good. 

I ordered a chimichanga with extra rice and shredded beef. The beef was ok but they need to Dd cheese and possibly some sort of sauce. This was the first chimi I've had that was dry. 

Give it a shot. Love the atmosphere.
