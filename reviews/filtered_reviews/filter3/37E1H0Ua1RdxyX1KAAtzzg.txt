I had been here once before for happy hour and was impressed; however dinner on Monday evening was so-so.

We arrived and were seated right away which was nice.  We did wait a bit for a server (there was confusion over the sections), who while cute and bubbly tried very hard, but wasn't the best server I've had...especially in Old Town.

My boyfriend and I ordered drinks and the guacamole appetizer.  All were good; however for the amount of people in the restaurant took too long to arrive.

I had the Chorizo porchetta (I believe it was called) and my boyfriend had the 1/2 chicken with fries.

Both meals were good, but not impressive.  If I hadn't been here before for a good happy hour I wouldn't likely pick this place again especially as the thing I was impressed with the most with was the decor...and even that was too dark for me to read my menu with ease!
