Normally, I get a burrito from Blue Burrito then head over to my favorite watering hole, Corcoran's.  However, I didn't have much time this trip, so i stopped by Jose Cuervo Tequileria to have a beer and Blue Burrito.

Food - This time I had their veggie burrito.  It was beans, rice, lettuce, tomato, sour cream, cheese, and guacamole.  They put way too much lettuce in this burrito.  Normally I have a steak or chicken burrito....but opted for the veggie.  While it tasted good, the lettuce drowned out the other flavors.

Atmosphere - It's a fun bar to hang out at.  Plenty of seats and FREE Wifi.

Will I return?  Yes, but probably won't order the veggie next time.
