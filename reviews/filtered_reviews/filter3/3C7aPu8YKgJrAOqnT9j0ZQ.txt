This place has a lot going for it in terms of atmosphere and the food is like other Sam Fox restaurants: consistent and pretty good. This is not an amazing dining experience and the food isn't anything special, but it's a relaxing restaurant. The service is pretty bad. Super young wait staff that look good but are slow and sometimes rude. 

I've eaten here 4-6 times and I always get the guacamole to start and the kobe beef burrito. The burrito is huge and I always have leftovers. One great thing about Blanco is the rice -- it's an odd side since it's pretty buttery but I think it's yummy. 

The chips and salsa are standard and I've often had stale chips. Also, the Pepsi is usually flat.

In sum: the food is pretty good and the atmosphere makes this place an appealing restaurant to return to, however the sub-standard service hit-or-miss drinks/chips can taint an otherwise good experience.

Go here and try it -- just know it's a gamble.
