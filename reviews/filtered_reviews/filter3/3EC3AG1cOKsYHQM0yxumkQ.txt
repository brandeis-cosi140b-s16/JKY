Cheap, fast, taco place. $2.00 street tacos, $4 quesadillas, and $5 half order fries (with meat) or $10 for full order. OK, so $2.00 isnt exactly CHEAP for street tacos, but this is near the strip and nothing else is that cheap around the area. i had the spicy pork taco which was good and we shared the half order of fries with pork. i dont know what kind of creamy white sauce they put on the fries, but it was really good. 

the best part of the experience was the lady helping us with our order. you're suppose to just walk up to the counter and order from the cooks, but one of the ladies came up and asked us if we needed help ordering. she explained almost the entire menu to us (which is pretty small) but as indecisive as i was, she was very patient with me and waited until i finally decided on my ONE taco.

the worst part of the experience (this is more for the BF), is that he had an upset stomach later that night from his two tacos and fries. :(
