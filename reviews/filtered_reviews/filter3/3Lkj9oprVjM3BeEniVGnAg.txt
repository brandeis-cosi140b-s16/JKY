I have heard about this fun Vegas resturant for one or two friends and they loved it.  I thought it was ok nothing to brag about.  But the secenery by the pool and in the casino was great. Beautiful people at this casino resort.  I had the pink tacos that came with beans and rice.  The tacos were decent and the rice sucked.  The bartender was friendly and quick with my beers.
