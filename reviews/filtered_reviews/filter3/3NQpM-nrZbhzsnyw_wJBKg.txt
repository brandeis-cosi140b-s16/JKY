Went for lunch - cool building - neat vibe.

We got a 'flight' of salsas and I ordered a two-taco combo.

The 3 salsa flight included tomato/poblano, green chile, and Hatch chile - (listed in descending order of favor).  The tomato/poblano tasted like what you expect salsa to taste like.  The green chile was pretty good, but I wasn't a fan of the Hatch - it had an almost fermented aftertaste - just not my thing.

For the tacos, I got a Costilla (short rib) and a fish taco.
The presentation was really nice, but...
The Costilla was (continuing my unfortunate theme for the week) - bland.
The fish taco kind of made me think I'd ordered fish and chips and they didn't have any malt vinegar - once again, bland.
On to the black beans and rice...you guessed it...bland.

Not what I was expecting.  It was good, it was well presented, everyone was nice, but I was looking for more kick.
