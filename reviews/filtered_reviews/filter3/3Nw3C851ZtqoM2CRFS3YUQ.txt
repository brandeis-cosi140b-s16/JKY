We have lived in this area for a few years, so we drive by LA Casa Blanca nearly every day.
From the street, it looks pretty bland, but once you get into the lot, you see that it is quite large and pretty busy. I think I may have stopped sooner if the lot was on the street instead if hidden.  
We went on a Friday night, got there about 630. Told the wait was 5-10 minutes, and we saw many open tables. 25 minutes later we were called back, and taken into another huge empty room. 
We got our drinks promptly,  but it took about 10 minutes to get silverware,  chips and salsa. Our food was out about 10 minutes after we ordered it. 
Kids portions were large, which was nice. We split an entree. It took awhile to get drink refills (water). 
The food was okay. Nothing spectacular. The beans were bland, the salsa was too spicy for the kids and okay for us. Our server was very nice, but the bus staff/runners were pretty lifeless. I thanks the guy who brought the chips and he didn't look up from his tray or even say hello or your welcome. 
I've heard their brunch is great, maybe we will go back for that sans kids. I like trying new places, especially non-chain places. This wasn't my fave,  but it wasn't the worst either.
