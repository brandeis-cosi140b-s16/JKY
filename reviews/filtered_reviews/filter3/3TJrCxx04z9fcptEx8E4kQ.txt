I actually enjoyed this "upscale" Mexican place in downtown Chandler. I had a mojito at first...well mojitos in general should come in a short glass...so it was okay...kind of sweeter than usual. The chips  and salsa was very good as we kept refilling 3 times.
Now to the main course...i had the Shrimp releno.....it was cheesy and they smothered it with some chili verde sauce. I wish they would put more shrimp but still good. The place is pricey but if you do go...sit outside...it is nice.
