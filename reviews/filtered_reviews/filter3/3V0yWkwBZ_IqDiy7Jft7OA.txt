When they bring the chips and salsa, ask for a straw.  Stick it in the mild salsa container and suck until the container is empty.  This will be the culinary height of the meal.

I ordered the Armando Combination so that I could try different things.  Don't do that.  I heard a waitress suggest the Carne Burrito.  Too late for my order.  The food, simply said, was bland.  The mild salsa was a medley of fresh ingredients in just the right mix.  Awesome.   The interior was classic small Mexican restaurant.  The service was fine.  Honestly, another visit is necessary to make a final decision.  But until then, I have to agree with Kansas G.

So, if you came for the food review, you can move on.  If you are interested in a little social commentary, please read on.

[Steps up on soapbox]

1) I really wish someone had warned me that this was "loud talker night" at La Fonda.  I'd have gone tomorrow.

2) Memo to the F-bomb boys across the restaurant: This isn't a saloon or some spit on the floor, get piss drunk night out at the pool hall.  So could you please keep the F-bomb laced conversation for the ride home?  I realize you were here on "loud talker night" but that only intensified the offensiveness.  Don't get me wrong, I love a great profanity-laced conversation as much as the next guy, just not at dinner.

3) While I'm sure that you believe that the $3.95/month you're paying for that shitty and annoying ringtone is a great investment, Harley-wearin'-F-bomb dude, I don't want to hear it at dinner.  Put the F-er on F-ing vibrate, please.  Does that help?

4) And then, once you answer the shitty ringtone call, please realize that the dude on the other end of the line does not hear you any better if you YELLLLL.  Of course I do, complete with the F-bombs.
