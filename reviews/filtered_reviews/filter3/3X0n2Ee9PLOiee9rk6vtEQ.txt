I wanted to love it...grew up in Huntington Beach, surfing in Baja (ensenada, rosarita, etc).  Raised at Wahoo's Fish Tacos and have a decent palate when it comes to fish tacos.  

Service was fine.  nice folks, speed was good.  The decor/patio gave me hope.

Our Group Ordered:  Quesadilla.  Shrimp Tacos.  Mahi Tacos.  Blackened Grouper tacos.

Quesadilla:  $4 for 1 store bought tortilla basically warmed in a microwave.  Like you would make for a snack for a toddler at home.  Weak.  

Shrimp Tacos:  decent.  Server said there were 5 shrimp per taco, mine had 3 shrimp.  Much better at cafe rio up the street.

Mahi Tacos:  lacking flavor.  Looked good.  let down.  wouldn't order these again.

Blackened Grouper:  also, lacked flavor, but the best of the 3 i ordered.  Note:   as i understand it, "blackened" is both a way of cooking (using butter/oil to char the fish, plus usually a cajun/pepper spice).  Again....this is NOT Wahoo's "blackened" fish  

Tap water:  awful.  even w/ lemon.  Get drinks...or soda water at least.

I will return, as i want them to succeed....I will try the other taco's and update.

Happy Hour: Mon - Thurs i will try the Cod Tacos...i think they are $1 buck a piece
