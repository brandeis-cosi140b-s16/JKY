i came here friday night after a mediocre experience at LAX. there was a line and i was kind of irritated because it took me so long to get over there, but the girl at the door immediately approached my friend and i and let us in for free.. score! 

i found the boyfriend and the rest of my drunk crew and was pleased to find a dance floor with enough space to move around. the DJ was pretty good, unfortunately i didn't buy any drinks because i was broke and had a flight leaving in a few hours that i absolutely could NOT miss. i did however, get a shot poured down my throat by the hot gogo dancer! 

let's talk about this. i'm a dancer and thus i watch gogo dancers. these girls are actually hot [seeing as how the ones in SF are.... not most of the time. haha] and all have their own style of dancing, but bottom line is they're workin' it and make the environment fun.
