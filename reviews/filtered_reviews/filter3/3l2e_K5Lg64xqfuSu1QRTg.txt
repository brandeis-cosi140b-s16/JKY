Their claim to fame seems to be the pollo fundido.  To that I say, I've had better.  While inexpensive, the fundido was a little salty and could have used more flavor, but all and all, not a waste of time. :). Salsa and chips are free for eat ins, and the salsa is yummy.  As for the best pollo fundido, I recommend Julio G's in Scottsdale and PV.
