I got back in AZ a few days ago and was craving spicy, delicious, savory Mexican food. And since my parent live in Chandler, the place with the best Mexican food yelp rating was Si Senor. I know that Si Senor is actually New Mexican style food, but that was what I was in the mood for... some spicy green chille salsa!

Si Senor has not changed since I lived in AZ three years ago. It still resembles a cafeteria with tables coated in a plastic table cloths, cheap chairs, and tube style tvs hanging in the corners. 

Let me start off my saying the service was OUTSTANDING. Our server was very attentive and made sure that were never needing more drinks. The food also arrived quickly, and piping hot; but, the food was just not that great. My mom's chimichanga and my enchilda were piping hot but dry inside. We needed extra green chilli salsa to get through out entrees.

Oh well! I am glad to see this business is doing so well, and have such an awesome following. Maybe I will be back during my next visit to AZ.
