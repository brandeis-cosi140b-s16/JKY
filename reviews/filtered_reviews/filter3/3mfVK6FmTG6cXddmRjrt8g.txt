Ordered a few different dips and appetizers.  The crab dip with pita chips were AMAZING but the guacamole was less than impressive.  It tasted like processed guac...nothing fresh about it.  I've had the fish tacos with a fruity drink in the past and they were delicious.  Great atmosphere and food overall!
