I was so excited to try this place. This area lacks charming locally owned restaurants, so I try to support the ones here whenever I can. 
 I have been following their facebook posts but never saw an official "We are open" announcement. So it wasn't till yelp reviews started popping up that I realized I could go. We went on a Thursday night. There was not a long line for the drive thru so we were able to get in and out pretty fast. 

Here is what we had- 3 chicken tacos, chips and salsa, croquettas, and 2 veggie tacos. It totalled maybe 16 dollars? Not a bad price at all. I was full too so I have no complaints on the portion size. I mean I could have eaten more, but its best I didn't.

Anyways, I thoroughly enjoyed the croquettas. They were freshly friend and very tasty. I liked the dipping sauce too. The spicy inferno salsa was also pleasantly spicy with a good flavor. Most places advertise that it is spicy, but it is never spicy enough for my husband, so he was pleasantly surprised that this actually had a little spice. (He could always use more spice though, he likes to cry when he eats his food.) 

The tacos on the other hand were not that great. They were just ok. The chicken tacos just seemed a little plane with only chicken and pico and sparse cheese. He really was not happy with the tacos, they were just kind of boring. They were also in a floppy flour tortilla. It did not really add anything, we would have preferred corn tortillas for the street taco experience. 

My veggie tacos were ok too. I think I enjoyed them a little more than my husband, but its not something I would go back for.  

So all in all, it was good, not the best. The service was fine, no complaints. I will give it another shot in a few months and see again.
