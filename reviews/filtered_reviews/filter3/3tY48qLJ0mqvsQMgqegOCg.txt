I finally took the time to take my butt over to this spot. My brother has been telling me that this place was bomb dot com for weeks!! He also kept comparing it to the neighboring Chipotle and how humongous their servings were!!

Everything previously stated were all true, but I still find myself under Chipotle's customer satisfaction list.  Yes, Cafe Rio is similar to Chipotle because of the whole burrito, tacos, and salad assembly line (where you choose meat, beans, rice, veggies, and dressing), but the tastes make it totally different and incomparable.

I had the Fire Grilled Chicken salad and it was pretty good.  The portions are definitely huge and can be taken to-go as your second meal of the day!! What turned me off was the rice though!! There was just something weird about the taste and texture (I can't seem to find the words for it). The lime rice at Chipotle is definitely undefeated!!! I did like the avocado ranch dressing though! That added another star to my rating! Haha, but overall it was an OK place. You'll definitely need to hit it up on an empty stomach so good luck & eat well! =D
