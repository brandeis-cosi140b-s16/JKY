3.5 stars. Abuelo's is a cool place, lively, colorful and generally pretty fun. The food is hit and miss. For example, I had a combo dish with a relleno, and it was one of the best chile rellenos I've ever had. Cheese enchiladas were so-so, and the taco was just kind of there and not happening. Chips and salsa were really good... They bring you 3 different kinds of salsa, and the tomatillo/pineapple one was relish! I'd go back, but it's a long way from where I live, so I wouldn't be making a special trip just for this place.
