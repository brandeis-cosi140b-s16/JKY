Very good but not enough zest, the meal was bland.  Next time I will ask them to add some chili.  The server was so so, immediately asked what we wanted to drink.  Hard to say when you just sat down.  The bus girls were wonderful, offering additional chip, salsa etc. However the waiter was less than marginal definitely not worth the tip I left.  Next time we will sit in the bar.  Was it worth the price, no!  Our local roach coach chili rellano is better and a third of the price.  Would I go back yes since it is the only
Mexican resteraunt locally.
