First time in Tempe. Thought we'd try some Mexican. Located in downtown Tempe surrounded by a ton of other restaurants. It was fairly easy to find, but the nearest parking lot charged $5.

Food: The green enchiladas were pretty good. We liked that they weren't soaked in sauce and that the tortilla still had some texture. We also tried the Clare enchilida, which was recommend. It's a nice vegetarian alternative, but nothing too special. The meat burro was a good size but way too greasy. The beans and rice were pretty good as well but what was weird was that you had to choose either rice OR beans if you ordered the combo plates, not both. 

Service: Service was fair. We were seated fairly quick considering the place was pretty busy, and we sat outside in the patio cause the weather was nice. The food was brought out in a timely manner, and was hot so that was good. The waitress was kind and it was nice that she left a pitcher of water for us, so that we didn't have to bother her for refills. 

Conclusion: The food was fair, but the portions we're too small for the buck. GrooveSession will not be returning. Hopefully we could find a Mexican restaurant in Tempe comparable to the ones we have back home.
