I read all the nice reviews about this place about both food and service. I would have to say I was a bit disappointed in both. I still gave you three stars however. The food. I had the chicharrones. It tasted a bit sour, perhaps a bit too much citrus or tomatoes in the recipe. The pork was good however. About the service. This was Sunday and our server was Jose "Tony". Although it took awhile to get our food we ran out of chips and salsa and never once did anyone refill them. Our water glasses were refilled only once. Our server never came back to check on us or ask how the food was. The only time he came back was to deliver the bill. Senor Mercado before you say that I should have flagged down the server or yelled across the room for his attention, I shouldn't have to - especially for the prices on your menu. I'm sure with all the positive reviews in the past this was an anomaly. Your team failed and unfortunately it was I who drew the short end of the straw on this visit.
