Like everyone has said the service is excellent. They very patiently help me make a decision of what I wanted to eat, letting me try samples of different things. I hate to say this because it seems like such a good idea but I don't think Asian and Mexican goes together in fact both types of food are wonderfully fine on their own. Mixing them both together and then adding a pound of grease is just not the business. The sauces were really good the rice was ok and that it about it. I did not like the meat in my dish or the flavor. My friend had the chille relleno and got sick soon after. My son wouldn't eat at all caused it looked like dog food especially in the foil bowls they give everyone. I give it three stars because I'm sure there's a meal there that taste good. But for me I just couldn't bring myself to go back and try it again especially because the atmosphere and decor are very depressing and old.
