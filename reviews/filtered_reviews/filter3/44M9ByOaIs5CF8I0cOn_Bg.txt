I was with a large party of 8 and we shared chips and salsa and guacamole, very tasty. I had three margaritas, which sounds like a lot, but these were pretty small drinks for $7.50 a pop.  Everyone really enjoyed their tacos and sides. I got the special of two cod tacos with rice and beans. One taco and a side are more than enough to fill me up. I will definitely be back to try out their jackfruit taco and kale salad side, but  I won't be getting another margarita here, way too pricey for the amount you receive. 

Also, they were unable to split up our bill and I had cash, but didn't receive change since they took the cash off the top... So I ended up overpaying by about 5 bucks, no biggie, but still... 

So overall great food and I really want to come back once it warms up and try out there patio, it looks awesome! Just the price of drinks and not getting change kept me from giving Verde 4 stars.
