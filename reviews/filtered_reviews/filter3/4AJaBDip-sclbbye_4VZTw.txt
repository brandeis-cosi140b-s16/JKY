Service was efficient and friendly and the recommendations were pretty good. It was generally agreed that it was corporate mexican food trying really hard not to be corporate mexican food. Not bad but not great.

The tequila list is good, if a bit overpriced. The most noteworthy menu item for me was the margarita made with mescal instead of tequila. It definitely had a nice smokey flavor as advertised, but for $12 I like my margaritas to have 3-4 times more booze in them than this one had. Maybe it's just me....

Anyone who thinks this is the best mexican food ever either has not eaten a lot of mexican food, or helped themselves a little too much to the 2 for 1 margaritas.
