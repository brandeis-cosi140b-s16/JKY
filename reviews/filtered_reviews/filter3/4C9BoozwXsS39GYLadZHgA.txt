Interesting menu. Tacos were fun (white fish, shrimp, and BBQ maki), and one taco a-la-carte with a drink would make a good, cheap meal.

The tortilla chips were mediocre and fried taco shell was not my style, so minus 2 stars.

Water Snob says: thumbs down for icky tap water. Will order a beer next time and try something other than a taco.
