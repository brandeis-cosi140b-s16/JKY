The Milagro Grill has a lovely dog-friendly patio.  Their service was attentitve.    We had a lovely time on a recent visit (our first).

I started with an Habanero Raspberry Margarita.  I thought the taste was good, but I was just coming off a recent visit to Paz Cantina (3rd St. and Roosevelt), where they serve a fresh-muddled Raspberry Margarita.   So, honestly, I was disappointed to get an artificially-flavored margarita.

We ordered Guacamole and Salsa to start.  The Guacamole was tasty and chips were fresh.   

For my main course, I ordered a beer-battered fried avocado street-style taco.   I really liked it!   I also ordered their "Mexican" corn on the cob which was smothered in a sauce that made the corn soggy.   I exchanged it for the bacon chili corn grits.  Kudos to the server who allowed me to exchange my corn on the cob for the grits The grits were the highlight of my meal.

My son and husband ordered the Achiote Chicken and Carne Asada street tacos and both boys declared them to be "fine."

I think we would return if we lived in the neighborhood, but Milagro didn't serve up enough miracles to make it worth a trip cross-town.
