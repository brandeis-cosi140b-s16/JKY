Came here during lunch time. Located a little bit off the strip. Kind of hidden. Ordered up the barbacoa and lengua tacos. Not bad. The hot sauces they provide are a bit mediocre. Chips and salsa are mot complimentary. Order came with charred jalape√±os. Some were mild and some were super spicy. So watch out.
