Boasting some of the best margaritas in town, Lindo Michoacan caters to the locals of Las Vegas and Summerlin. Spacious seating and attentive servers allows this friendly Catina to accommodate both large and small groups well. There is daily live music although it is not the authentic  sound I would expect at a Mexican restaurant. This place is good, and I would  go back, but it will not know your socks off. You will leave satisfied but not blown away.
