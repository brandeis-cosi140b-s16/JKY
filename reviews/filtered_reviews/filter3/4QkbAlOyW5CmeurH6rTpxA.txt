Margaritas were very good.

Although plenty of seats filled when we got there people began clearing out yet the service was a bit slow.  

However, I did put in a request for a birthday surprise for my guest which they handled very well...about 6-7 employees came over, one with guitar, 1/2 a shot, a big hat and a nice simple desert with one candle in it.

Food was ok and the view was very nice.  Be sure to ask for a window seat ahead of time.

I agree with Andrea L.'s posting on 5/21/2012 that states the food was "generic".  Can't explain why as many people seem to like this place and I've been to many different mexican restaurants. 

Atmosphere was good. 

P.S. Please note that my previous review of VIVA Michoacan was actually for LINDO Michoacan. The two are separate restaurants at separate locations.
