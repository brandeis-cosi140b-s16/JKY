My brother wanted to try this place out and rightfully so.  I mean how many places serve chinese and mexican food under one roof?  Notwithstanding the concept, the bright lights and artistic decor you felt like something was a bit off.  I expected to see a fusion of dishes on the menu, but instead it was more like two restaurants on one menu.  Although I feel like its a novel concept, the prices are high for what it normally costs.  Now granted maybe it costs more to maintain this kind of a restaurant, but the general knowledge of mexican and chinese food, is that it shouldn't be extremely expensive without some fancy hard to find, hard to spell, impossible to make dish that's tagged for $$$ dollars 

Ordered:
Chips and Salsa $4 (The chips were good and the salsa was fire roasted)

The Unruly Monk - hand-cut noodles/ wild wood ear mushrooms/ poached egg/spicy sauce $17.88  (Very good, although I've had this at a standard chinese restaurant at very good tastes for half the price.)

Lengua  - beef tongue/salsa pasilla $4 (Fantastic melted in your mouth)

Viva China - soft beef tendon/ Kumamoto oyster/scallions/ Sichuan peppercorn sauce $5.50 (One of the strangest things I've ever tasted, I'm still not sure if I liked it or not.  The consistency of the oyster just makes the whole thing a little off.)

So in summary, this restaurant is an interesting idea, although I don't think its implemented quite right.  Pre established bargain cuisine, such as Chinese and Mexican, can certainly throw someone well versed in that universe into a frenzy with prices.  Although our waiter was great, the service just didn't justify the prices.

If you don't plan to eat much, then it's $$, but if you plan to actually eat a meal, then make it $$$.  

Would I go back?  Sorry, but my dollars will be going elsewhere
