Went to Gallo Blanco for dinner and placed a Togo order. Being that it is my first time in Phoenix I figured lets check out what the people of yelp had to say about dinner options. I ordered the queso fundido which was made up of melted Oaxaca cheese with vegetables Served with chips and tortillas. I did not enjoy their version of queso at all. I also ordered a carne asada burrito which happen to be one of the best burritos I have had in a while. The burrito was packed with lots of flavor I would have to say my favorite parts were the tender grilled ribeye and fire salsa flavors. I did notice that the host was rude and food took 27 minutes for a Togo order which is crazy to me.
