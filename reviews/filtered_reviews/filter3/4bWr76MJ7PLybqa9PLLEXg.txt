I have stopped here a couple of times. I really would like to give it a 4 star rating, however it is honestly a 3. The burritos are pretty good however the place could use some fixing up. The seating is not that great and the dining room is not always clean.

Their burritos are indeed Phat. To eat a whole one takes some time. The ingredients are par at best. Some times the rice is a little hard. The veggie burrito contains squash and peppers, which sounds a bit odd, but is a rather tasty addition.

Finally, I must mention the "salsa bar". It's more of a salsa cart with some mediocore sauces. The salsa verde is lacking. The plain salsas have ok flavor but even the "hot" one is quite mild. The pico de gallo if pretty decent.
