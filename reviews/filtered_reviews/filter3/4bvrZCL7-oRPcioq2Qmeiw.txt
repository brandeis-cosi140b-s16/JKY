I recently went here with my family after a long day of moving. I remember I'd been here quite a few years ago, but I didn't remember what it was like, so now we're back to try it again.

I'm going to keep this review relatively short because there's really not that much to say. The mexican food here is just about what you get at every average mexican food restauraunt in arizona. That is to say that it's good, and it's fresh. The food came out hot and the tortilla chips were crispy. What I didn't like about this place was that it really busy. I don't mind busy usually, however, when you don't have the wait staff to keep up with cleaning tables, and you're sat down at a table that still has crumbs on it and no silverware it's a problem. There were several tables that still had drink cups and plates waiting to be bussed away after a meal. The Waitress barely spoke any english. I wasn't terribly hungry when we came, so I tried to order a flauta a la carte, and she brought me a flauta meal. They were good and i didn't have any complaints, but I don't care for rice and beans, which is why i ordered a la carte. My wife liked the rice and beans however. The fried ice cream was pretty good, although not as crispy as I like, I don't think it was fried long enough. The sopaipilla were good as well. Overall, decent mexican food, below average cleanliness and wait staff bring this place down. I'd go back with a family member if they wanted, but on my own I'd rather go to macayos.
