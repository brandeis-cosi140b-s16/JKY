I have been to Cafe Rio on a few previous occasions, so I came in not thinking very highly of their food. I came in for lunch recently and was surprised that I actually liked it a lot more than I remembered. 

I ordered the sweet barbacoa salad and although it was nothing amazing, the flavors were pretty good. They make their own tortillas, but honestly I was not a big fan of them. The texture was just off, so I'll probably stay away from their burritos. They have quite a few different menu options, which is nice as well. My salad was flavorful and the portions are enormous, which makes it a great option for lunch. There do seem to be a lot of flavors going on at one time, so flavor is definitely the name of the game at Cafe Rio. 

The restaurant itself is extremely loud at lunchtime and the line was incredibly long. It's all right grub, but I still prefer Chipotle to Cafe Rio as far as chain build your own burrito restaurants.
