I have been here twice now, I got the "mexi-cob w/ chicken" the first time and liked it so much I got it the second time. Tho they claim to be, they're not as vegan or vegetarian friendly as they think. So my girlfriend is very unhappy with either one of the orders of make-shift vegetarian tacos she's had, but she loves their margaritas. One thing I will say is, there's a difference in having good service and then too much service, both times I felt like I had 6 people waiting on me, I constantly had people talking to me and felt I never had second to actually enjoy my food. Also, their whole delivery system for chips and salsa is terrible. They start by asking you which salsa I want as if I knew my options, so I ask for all at once so I can decide. Then they give you a basket of chips with these tiny little, smaller then a shotglass, cups of salsa. The chip barely fits in the cup. You kinda have to pick up the cup and pour the salsa on each individual chip. It's bananas. Has this nacho daddy character never been to a  Mexican restaurant? What is he trying to prove? They all taste great but it's almost too much work to enjoy. Last but not least, this place is a coke establishment, which is always a plus for me!
