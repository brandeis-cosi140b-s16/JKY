My go to place has been slipping a little.  The last couple of times I've come the food is either over cooked or under cooked.  The brie & tenderloin toast was over cooked the last 2 times to where the toast was burnt and still served and the bacon on the bacon wrapped shrimp was on the raw side. 

The service is still very good and the patio is awesome when the weather is nice.  They also have the best reverse happy hour which starts at 10 PM and I believe and goes til 1 AM.
