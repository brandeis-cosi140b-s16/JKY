Salsa lived up to expectations from previous reviews. Only drawback and this is purely personal preference, was the level of saltiness. I prefer less salt but it wasn't overpowering. I wanted the carnitas but unfortunately it was not available during the time I visited. Opted for the California burrito (chicken). Everything that was served was hot and fresh. I feel this review would have been 4 stars if the carnitas would have been available.
