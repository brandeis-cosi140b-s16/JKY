A friend of mine works nearby and invited me to lunch here a couple weeks ago. I enjoyed my burger so while on a staycation at Paris, I wanted to bring my wife here (located inside Ballys) to try these huge ass nachos I saw on my previous visit. 

The burger I had a couple weeks ago was the Tequila Bar Open Range Cheeseburger. The $12 price tag included fries. It was simple having lettuce, tomato and red onion but hit the spot.The fries were cooked a tad too crispy and even though our server was nice it took forever for the food to come.

The last visit My wife and I shared an order of El Jefe's Nachos Grande. Without your rewards card the nachos are $18 and meant to be shared. My picture came out blurry but man this was a big plate of nachos. The nachos were only okay. More chips than toppings. I think it is the size that makes people interested in trying it. Like a gimick to get you talking. Like my first visit the nachos took forever to come out. This place is just average. Look for the groupon so it is worth it.
