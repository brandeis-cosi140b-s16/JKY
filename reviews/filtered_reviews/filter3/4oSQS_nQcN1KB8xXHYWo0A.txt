I like to eat the fried Carne Asada tacos.
Ive been eating that for a few years now since my college days and its always consistently good.
Also have had the Carne Asada Fries and they are pretty decent and the Chimichanga has been recommended to me by my friend for years.
Been to a few different locations thru-out the city but this one is the cleanest one.
Not an everyday kind of place but good enough to keep on the list for that once in a while visit.
Solid B.
