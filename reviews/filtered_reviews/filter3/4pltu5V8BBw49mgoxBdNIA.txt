My experience here left me willing to try it again, though it didn't live up to expectations.

I came in by myself at dinner time. I was promptly seated and provided with chips. The server was by herself handling the entire dining room and bar at supper, and as a solo diner, I was last priority. It took me all of two minutes to choose what I wanted--a single taco--but it took fifteen minutes for my order to be taken. If I hadn't been given the chips, I would have given up and left. In the meantime, I saw people who came in after me get complete service because they ordered drinks.

The chips were excellent--very fresh. I like the salsa bar but the lighting was poor back there so it was hard to see what was what.

Finally a male server joined her and he took my order. My Aztec chicken tinga taco came out about five minutes later. It was excellent. The chicken was very tender and tasty. Just the right about of spice. It only took about five minutes to catch the server's eye and soon enough I was on my way.
