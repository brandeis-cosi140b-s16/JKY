Never tried the place before now. Decent prices,nice atmostphere. Tried the quesadilla appetizer-good stuff-love the mushrooms,very different than most,and the southwestern ranch sauce.  Good sangria. I liked it a lot overall. The chimi was not my favorite,I've had much better.  Doesn't 'abuelo's' mean 'grandparents?  My hubs had a steak sampler once when they were doing a promo,and he really liked it.
