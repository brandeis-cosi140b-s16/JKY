I've been to this restaurant three times now. I instantly fell in love the first time because it's hard to find a more modern, upscale style of Mexican restaurant anywhere these days. The first time I ordered these amazing shrimp enchiladas. They were flavorful and covered in this light creamy poblano sauce. YUM! 

The second and third times, the food has just faltered. The chicken mole enchiladas were not that great. The sauce was delicious but unfortunately inside was just plain, dry shredded chicken. It wouldn't been nice for the chicken to have some flavor and not just rely on the mole sauce just on top of the enchiladas. 

Another miss were the spinach enchiladas. I think it had the same creamy sauce as the shrimp enchiladas and that was tasty. But again, the spinach filling was completely unseasoned. It was basically just spinach that tasted as if they thawed some frozen spinach and through it in the enchilada - not even any salt! Due to the lack of seasoning, it actually had that overcooked muddy taste that spinach can develop when treated improperly. 

I really want to be a fan because their menu and dining room are great, but maybe I'm just hoping it will be something it's not. Sorta like a bad relationship. =)
