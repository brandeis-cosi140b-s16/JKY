I had breakfast at Fausto's Mexican Grill #3.  The great thing about this joint is that it opens BEFORE 6 AM.  This is huge.  I had the ham/potato/cheese/egg breakfast burrito.  This is enormous and is only $3.95.  Also, the burrito was grilled after, which gives it a little crust on the tortilla.  I love this.  The burrito itself was good, but there was nothing that stood out about it.  It's basic scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, potatoes and sliced ham.  The potatoes weren't grilled or fried, so they were just kind of mushy in there.  No texture.  That being said, it was good, I'll just try the chorizo next time.

Fausto's has a pretty standard salsa bar.  I had the green, which was good.  It didn't have pico, I'll ask for some next time.  From the reviews, it appears as though I should come for lunch or dinner.  I'll be back...
