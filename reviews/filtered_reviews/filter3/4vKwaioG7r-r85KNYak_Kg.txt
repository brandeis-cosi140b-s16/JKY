Came here for a late dinner with my hubby. This location is inside the Miracle Mile Shop at The Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. The atmosphere was fun but a bit loud. The chairs however are uncomfortable. This is a good spot to come with a group to have drinks. Now to the food. We ordered the teriyaki wings to start which were very good. They were crispy and the sauce was tasty. For the entree I had the Fish Tacos which tasted good but the fish was tough and over cooked! My hubby had the beef enchiladas which he said he enjoyed. Both dishes came with rice and beans which we both didn't really care for. Our server was very attentive and catered to our needs. I had a Groupon that I purchased which made our bill only $20 bucks! Can't beat that! Will we return here probably not but overall the meal was okay!
