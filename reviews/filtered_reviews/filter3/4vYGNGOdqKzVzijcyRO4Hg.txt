A great place for some quick and easy Mexican food while in the galleria area. Definitely, not the best Mexican but it very tasty and closer to Tex -mex opposed to the Baja-mex style. 

The crab and shrimp enchiladas are yummy and the queso is tasty! The salsa is not spicy more along the lines of pico de gallo.
