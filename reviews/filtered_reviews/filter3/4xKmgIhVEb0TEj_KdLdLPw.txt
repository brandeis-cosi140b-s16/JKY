I have a mixed review of Cabo Wabo. We waited about 20 mins to get seated outside, for a party of 10. It's a great atmosphere, music, beautiful views of Bellagio water show. 

I ordered the Baja shrimp Ceviche and it was quite salty and lacking flavor. A friend ordered the Ahi ceviche and she said it tasted strange and was sweet. My husband ordered the carne asada tacos and he loved it. Some friends ordered steak Fajitas for 2 and they raved about how delicious the steak is. However they all got charged extra for rice and beans which they received but didn't order. But was later removed after we brought it up to the manager. When paying our $300 bill, I asked about an odd additional "tax" they charged which was close to $13. They said Planet Hollywood charges them for being their so they pass that charge along to the customer (which is ridiculous). 

Really, a Mexican restaurant that doesn't have complimentary chips and salsa?!?

We dined inside last week and it wasn't anything special. Today we sat Outside is way better if u can handle the heat or in our case the wind!
