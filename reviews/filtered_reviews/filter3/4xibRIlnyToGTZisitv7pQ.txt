Had a group business dinner here while in PHX.  If you are out of town the location can be a tricky as it is inside a shopping plaza.  Most of the group was about 10 mins late (I know I know...sad when most of us have GPS capable mobile phones).  We found it due to the friendly local police and Downtown Phoenix greeters (?).  

The restaurant did not have a private room (we had a group of 15) but we were there really early.  The chip basket is AMAZING!  It has a bunch of different chips from tortilla, to different types of potates and even these fried pieces of goodness (that reminded me of wontons).  The salsa was really good too.  The waitstaff was great....they provided lots of these chip baskets during our 3 hour meeting.  When the meeting concluded...it was straight to the top shelf margaritas which we've been dying for since we sat down.  It's a great deal for top shelf tequila and the quantity.  You get about 2-4 drinks as they even give you some reserve in the cocktail shaker.  

Food was good.  I had the sirloin which was cooked perfect at medium.  My friend sitting next to me ordered the same thing at medium rare but got it well done.  She sent it back and after a few minutes got a new one closer to the rare side but she was happy.

If I lived in the area and was able to visit again I could consider becoming a fan of this place.  Definitely check it out.  Another plus - they have a patio too!
