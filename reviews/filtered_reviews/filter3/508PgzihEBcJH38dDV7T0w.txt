For quality and taste of food this place is a solid 5, unfortunately the service lack a bit at my most recent visit and it resulted in luke-warm food and a long dining time frame.  The menu has a good variety and what's included in the dinner is a good value (Beans, Rice, Sopaipillas, Chips and Salsa)

The four Salsa/Dips served with the chips are "hot".  I personally enjoyed them all, but  my family had differing opinions.  The sopaipillas were a little dry but drenched in honey they were still a nice treat.

The chicken chimichanga was large and delicious.  Of course the portion size was a little out of control so I was able to take some home for another meal.

The service was the major malfunction of our visit.  As it was Friday, it was busy.  We were seated in about 20 minutes.  We received chips and drinks fairly quickly, however once we ordered our food, it took at least 30 minutes to get it.  Several families who were seated after us received their food before us.  When we finally received our food it wasn't at an ideal temperature.  It was still warm enough to eat, but it did seem like it sat under a warmer for a while.  

Overall, I would recommend Si Senor as the Mexican food served is quite appetizing and well worth it.
