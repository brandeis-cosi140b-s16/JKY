Fast service. Casa Don Juan has your run of the mill tex-mex with other native Mexican/South American dishes on the menu. The pricing is fair and the margaritas are exceptional(I believe they carry Cazadores, one of my favorite tequila brands. The serving are usually huge and I can never finish my plate. It's a good place for a first date and other casual social occaisions.
