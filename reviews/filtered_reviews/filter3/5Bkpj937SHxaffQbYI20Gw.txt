This is definetly in an old Fazoli's, I know because I help open it when it was built.

Food here is hit or miss, the green chile chicken burrito is blah. Dry and tasteless.

However, the hard shell chicken taco is very good. The cheese enchiladas are good but not great. I have had the chorizo and potato burrito and it is good,  but Ramiro's and Senor Taco do it better. 

This was my second visit, first time i could not rate them because they did not have green salsa. This time they did and I give that 4 stars. But, they guy behind the counter acted like they are doing us all some kind of favor by selling it "Oh, your lucky today, we have green salsa". I guess they run out-proof was my first visit- but while it is good, I am not dying to put it on everything, so it is not that good. El Paisano in El Mirage is a carneceria that has the BOMB green salsa. 

Why three stars-no carnitas or asada and the tortillas, well the are good but I don't crave them.

I may be a guera ( I am the gringa that speaks spanish and busts all the cabrons talking shit) but let me tell you, I grew up in a Mexican family in Hatch, NM/Las Cruces/El Paso area and have had some spectacular tortillas and these don't even come close.
