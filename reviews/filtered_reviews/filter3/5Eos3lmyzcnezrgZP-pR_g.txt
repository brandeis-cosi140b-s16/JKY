While the food was excellent, and our booth was comfortable, there were some significant problems on my first visit here.  

Limey Guacamole made tableside to order of spice, tomatoes, onions, and cilantro tasted very good, along with homemade tortilla chips, hot salsa, and a mild Bean Dip.  Fideo Soup was different and interesting: tomato based but not noticeably so, with delicate thin and short noodles.

Water refills came slowly, and had to be requested.  But, far worse, food was really long in coming.  We were told "the food's on the way" and "It should be here soon!"  But it really wasn't.  In fact, my party of four was seated at 6:30 p.m.; we ordered the main meal at 7:00 p.m.; and, other than guacamole and soup, no food arrived until 57 minutes later.  A friend's shrimp dish was requested to be avocado free, but her order of a Mexican Omelet included sliced avocados,  The manager did take items off the bill, but I would much rather had my order timely served.

Diane enjoyed her Shrimp Quesadilla, and I really liked my #12 Combo.  So, because the quality and taste of the food were so good here, I will make a return trip, and hope that the timeliness and efficiency of cooking and serving both improve.
