This place was cute but so overpriced.  Lunch for 8 was $600!!!!...  ridiculous.  

Margaritas were really good except they were out of the organic ingredients for the organic margarita I ordered off the menu.  I had a house margarita and a Sangria margarita and they were both excellent.  Not sure worth the $29 price but they were good.

Salsas were odd, it was a blend of 3 sauces.  The citrus/cilantro blend was good, the others were odd tomato pastey runny dips.  We ordered guac which was better than the salsas.

I was disappointed by the menu to see nothing vegetarian, so I ordered the tostadas w/out the meat that it comes with.  They were pretty good.

Service was terrible.  Our waiter was pushy, even convincing us to get margaritas to go to take w/us to the pool (he didn't mention we weren't supposed to take them into the pool area...  we had to smuggle them in).  It took forever to order and get the missing silverwear and then when someone in our group spilled water into one of our chip baskets it was a big ordeal to find someone to request (and then wait) for more.

It was good light Mexican but I'm sure there's much better outside the hotel.  If you want to hang out by the pool this is the closest sit down place.
