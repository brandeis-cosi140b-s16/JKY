This has to be one of my only ratings for a restaurant where I didn't eat the food.  I had a stomach ache yesterday, so I wasn't able to enjoy anything more than just ginger ale.  I had to survey my friends and get their perspective in order to make this review possible.  Here is how it breaks down:

1. Food and drinks- The food was average tasting with an okay amount of flavor.  It was happy hour and the meal was a very modern size.  It was $4 for 3 mini tacos.  It makes me wonder what the regular price is.  Everyone said the drinks were pretty good and well blended.

2. Service-  We had the hottest waitress.  Everyone in the group was with their significant other, and they gave me a hard time in flirting with her.  I played along with it, but she was nice about it.  She gave us a lot of free chips and salsa, realizing the food didn't fill up the crew.  Chips and salsa was the only food thing I tried with my stomach ache, and the salsa had an unique sweet taste.  I usually like my salsa spicy, but this was good.

3. Ambiance- It has a very modern feel, just likes it name.  I would say it is a cool lounge where you can enjoy a good bite to eat, great company, and watch the game.  I wish the outside patio seating had some TVs so I can watch the Lakers vs. Knicks game.

Overall, its a good place.  I probably need to dine here myself and update this review.  I will definitely come back based on service and ambiance.
