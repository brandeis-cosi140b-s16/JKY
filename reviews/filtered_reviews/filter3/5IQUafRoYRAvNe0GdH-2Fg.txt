Have been to Nacho Daddy a number of times over the last year.  I can definitely see a change in their food since the last big menu revision.  

Used to love the nachos but they're  now fairly mediocre :(.  I can't drink so have never been able to try any of the margaritas.  I've narrowed down on what I will eat there to the fajita salad simply because I love the chimichuri dressing.  But they have a tendency to load it with cotija cheese to the point you can't taste anything else.  My husband likes the chicken enchiladas, the only part of that dish I enjoy is pulling the peppers out of the salsa garnish to eat with my salad.

They have two really good waitresses (Chelsea and a blond - sorry can't remember her name right now).  The rest it's; really hit and miss on the service you're going to receive.
