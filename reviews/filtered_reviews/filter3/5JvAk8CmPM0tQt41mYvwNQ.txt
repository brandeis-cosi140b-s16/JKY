I enjoy me some Mexican food. This may not be my favorite Mexican food place, but it's alright. 

The rice and beans are pretty good. I have had a few things from the menu and so far my favorite is the Pollo Fundido (it's called something crazy on the menu) and it's pretty tasty. 

Their lunch menu is great because the portions are just right and it's not that expensive, but it isn't really cheap. 

Overall, it's alright.
