From the outside appearance I was hesitant to try this place; however, from the reviews I was encouraged to go in. Like many of the previous reviews, the portion sizes of the burrito and quesadilla were large. I ordered a veggie burrito and it was really good. The sour cream and guacamole were delicious additions. We also ordered a caramel brownie. My husband and I both ate under $15. This is a great place for lunch or non-fancy dinner. The interior was colorful and very casual. And the impressive part was when it was slow, the employees were cleaning. I appreciate a clean kitchen.
