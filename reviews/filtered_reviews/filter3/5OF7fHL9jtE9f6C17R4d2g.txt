I'm knocking this place down to 3 stars. The food wasn't nearly as good this time around as my previous two visits. The base of the sope seemed thicker and chewier than before and the chicken and carnitas toppings were overcooked and dry. The lobster tacos were stuffed with lettuce, cotija cheese, sour cream and other stuff that I could barely taste any lobster. Less ingredients would have made this a much better dish. The chicken flautas were so bone dry and overcooked that they were pretty much inedible.

Overall, it was a real disappointment considering we enjoyed their food previously. The service was also a little spotty, but it seemed like there weren't enough waitresses for all of the tables. The food is overpriced, so if you go make sure you get a gift certificate from restaurant.com.
