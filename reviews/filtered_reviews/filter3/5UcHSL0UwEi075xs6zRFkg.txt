We had a Groupon and decided to try this place out.  Coming from Florida, we had high expectations. We were surprised that the place was empty at 12ish on Thursday.  We were literally the only customers.  The place is very nicely decorated. The waitress told us that we couldn't order Cuban coffee because the machine was broken.  We were disappointed.  So we ordered food and mojitos.  The food was kinda bland.  The mojitos were ok. At the end of the meal, a different waitress offered coffee.  Turns out the machine wasn't broken. Wtf?  We probably won't be back.
