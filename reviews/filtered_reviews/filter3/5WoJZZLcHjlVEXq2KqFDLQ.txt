Came here with a huuuuge group of 18 people, and we were seated instantly, orders taken, served, bam, bam, bam. Our waiter was incredibly friendly, if a tad on the demure side. Free chips and salsa for all, did anyone mention that? OF COURSE THEY DID because it is very nearly a phenomenon in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. (Can we get the Mexican Restaurant League of Carbohydrate Advocates on this? What is the deal?) I myself was seduced by their incredibly sensuous (yes) guacamole, which goes for only 2.99 a bowl, as opposed to the national mean of 4.99 (Christine-generated statistics. I've been to Texas. And California. Hey!). It was amazing. I almost ordered it again, but then I saw churros sticking out of a martini glass filled with ice cream and was intrigued...but then I ordered flan with ice cream because I wanted to try the homemade flan instead. The flan itself was not the texture I am used to...it was more like extra firm tofu, but the caramel sauce was caramel-y? I had a chicken fajita from my neighbor's plate and it was good, but I thought perhaps they could benefit by making their own flour tortillas? Always fluffier, always impress in a Mexican restaurant. Prices are on the steeper end, but, once again, must be a Pittsburgh thing (what is the DEAL?). Next time I will be going straight for the sangria margarita I've heard so much about, and laying waste to more chips.
