Went on Sunday 7-26-15 around 12:30 PM.  This restaurant is located next to Red Robin on Tropical & Centennial Center Blvd.  
I have been to the location on Desert Inn & the one down in Henderson, and this one's no different.  
It's an obligatory mexican restaurant.  Yes, there is crap hanging on the walls, yes they will sing to you on your birthday, yes they have margaritas. 
I never liked guacamole until I had it at Lindo Michoacan.  It is phenominal.  They make it tableside. Yeah, it's $8.50 but it's soooo worth it.  I don't like avocados or cilantro but I love their guacamole.  It doesn't even make sense.  
On this particular day I decided to try the combination plate #1 which is a chile relleno, chicken enchilada, and beef taco($16.95).  Too expensive and the chile relleno was sooo soggy and watery. It was like somebody fried a chile yesterday, warmed it up today, then dumped sauce on it and microwaved it again.  Yuck.  The beef taco and the enchilada were great.  
The service is always crazy good.  Yesterday Luis was our server.  He couldn't have been better!! 

One star for Luis, one star for the delicious guac, one star for cleanliness.
