Mixed reviews. First time I went here it was excellent. Food was great, service was fast, drinks were delicious. Second time a few months later, not so great. Service was slow, wrong orders came out, drinks were forgotten and food was cold. Might give it another try for a better data set, but I might just go somewhere else.
