this place has a killer happy hour. cheap beers and margaritas, the margarita of the day - my fav is mango - and the good, cheap happy hour food keep bringing me back. when it isn't happy hour, i beg you to order the carne fundido - fried goodness stuffed with tasty steak covered in cream cheese and cheddar. an absolute indulgence worth every calorie.

i prefer this location because it feels authentic - a dying strip mall in a somewhat rough pocket that begs newcomers to stop in, overlook the lack of renovation, and expect only good food. you may have to ask the hostess to have someone to wipe the rice from the seat before you sit, the menu may have crayon on it, and the glass your drink is served in may show some significant age, but you're going to get good food. as one might assume, this is not a swanky place. food prices are fair and good liquor is available, though the luna's well is pretty low on the liquor totem pole .... call your vodka if you don't want to be drinking gordon's. the house made chips are killer, as are the two salsas they serve with them. expect your fork to be bent, your knife to be dull and your server to be friendly.

there are some oddities:
the teenager menu, a seemingly new addition, just confuses me.
my server is never available to refill my soda, but is always there, breathing down my neck to order another margarita.
the chips and salsa are really, really good, but the chips are served in extremely small bowls and seconds don't seem to be encouraged. 

so valle luna, with all my affection for you, my years of  being a faithful customer and your oddities considered, you get 3 stars. and i wouldn't have you any other way.
