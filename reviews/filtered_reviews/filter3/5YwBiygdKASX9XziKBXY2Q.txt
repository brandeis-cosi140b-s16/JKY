I really wanted to like this place.  That being said, not sure we will be going back.  It comes down to the customer service.  Breakfast burritos available until 10:30.  We walk up to the window and wait about 3-4 minutes and finally take a closer look inside (the windows are tinted to make sure someone is really in there). There weren't any cars in the drive thru and no one else outside..  We must have gotten their attention, a girl opens the window and says oh hi, sorry about the wait... I order a breakfast burrito and she tells me, oh we stopped making those about 2 minutes ago.... I nicely mentioned I was in line before that time, and she just repeats we stopped making those.  The end.   She seemed irritated after this so we just ordered other items off the menu.  She couldn't close that window soon enough it seemed after we ordered.  15 minutes later our order was ready.  Hopefully it doesn't take that long all the time.  I understand if it is the beginning of lunch it might take some time to get the lunch food out and prepared. Here is what we ordered and what we though of it.
Empanadas- they were ok, about 4x3 so pretty tiny but they are only 2.49.  I don't think they were homemade there, but nonetheless, the crust was flaky.
Croquetas- we didn't like them.  Not crispy, kinda mushy.
Al Pastor burrito- Best Al Pastor we have ever had.  
Carne Asada- It was ok, comparable to Chipolte.
