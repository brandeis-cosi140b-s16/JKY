This is one of my favorite places for take out in Old Town.

I'm only giving it three stars because they've messed up my order a couple times and the food is good, not great but an excellent value regarding the amount of food you get for the price you pay. I usually go for the heavy "Texas Burger" donned with cheese, bacon, bbq sauce and onion rings with a side of fries.

Again, great value for the amount of food but the quality isn't top notch. I'm also a bit confused as to why they have a woman singing in there during lunch time. That would keep me from eating at their restaurant because it's both loud and a bit uncomfortable since the music she's singing is so out of style that I don't think my grandparents would even enjoy it. I'm sure they lady has a great time doing it and makes money with it, just not my taste.

If you're looking for cheap takeout with crispy fries and large burgers, hit up David's. They'll even deliver but it takes much longer for your food to arrive than if you were to call it in and pick it up. Plus, the one time I've had it delivered it all showed up soggy.
