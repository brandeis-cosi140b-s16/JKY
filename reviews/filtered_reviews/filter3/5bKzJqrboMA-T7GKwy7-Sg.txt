Visited this trendy cafe on a Thursday evening and it was 3/4 full.   I ordered an assortment of Taco's which included: Carne Asad, Halibut Taco, and their Pork taco.  Service was slow and had to wait at least 30mins for the food to arrive.  The Taco's were good, and came with the usual green and red sauces.  This restaurant is like an upscale King Taco, but the quality of the Taco's are a notch or two below the mighty King.
