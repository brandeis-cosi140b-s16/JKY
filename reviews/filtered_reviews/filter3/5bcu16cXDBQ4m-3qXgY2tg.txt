My GF was craving Mexican and wanted to gamble so we found ourselves at the Silverton and patronizing Mi Casa Grill.. 

Staff was top notch. Quick to fill drinks and keep your complimentary chip basket filled. The menu seemed a little weak. Mostly just your basic Mexican fare and nothing screamed out "I'M SPECIAL TRY ME!"

My GF tried the Steak Fajitas and was upset that they had poured a tomato/basil sauce over everything. This is a Mexican restaurant not an Italian one so I can understand her confusion and disappointment. 

Management came over right away when they saw her frown after tasting the sauce and offered to remake the dish for her. She declined, scraped off the sauce and dove right in. Turned out the sauce is fairly new on the fajitas and many people don't like it. (Why is it still being served that way would be a good question for the kitchen manager)

I had the seafood enchiladas. They seemed a bit off visually and even a little disappointing that they were using micro/extra small shrimp. After a few sample bites to reassure my tastebuds I liked the dish I ended up cleaning my plate.

They don't make the guacamole at your table but from the taste and chunks found in your order it does appear they are making it fresh in the kitchen it wasnt the best in Vegas but I'd give it top five for Guacamole. My only complaint on the Guacamole was that I had to share it with my table.

All in all we will give it another try should our taste buds crave Mexican and we find ourselves inside of the Silverton Casino but we won't be going to the Silverton specifically to eat here.
