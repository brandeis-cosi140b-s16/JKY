As with many things...its never quite as good as the first time.  The food was fine and our server was fantastic.  We sat in a different part of the restaurant than I was used to and it was great.  It was like we were in our own private dining room.  Is it the best food I have ever eaten?  No.  Is it the best? No.  It is exactly three stars.
