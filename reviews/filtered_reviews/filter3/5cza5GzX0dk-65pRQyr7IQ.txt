The food was pretty good but my main complaint is I felt they were trying to nickel and dime us. After buying expensive drinks we were asked if we wanted chips and salsa I figured they were complimentary due to the way the girl asked. I hadn't even looked at a menu at this point. Then before we finished the chips and salsa they brought over more saying they wanted to give us warm chips. We did t ask and we weren't out. When the bill came turns out they had been billing us the whole time. After complaining they took it off the tab but I felt this was a sham to try and rack up the bill.
