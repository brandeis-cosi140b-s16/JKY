Been coming here since January 2014. The food is amazing but today I ordered food by phone and when I got to the restaurant to pick it up the waitress or the person giving the orders was very rude and nasty.  I asked for forks knives and napkins because it was a big order. She gave me a dirty look and said that the forks and knives and napkins were around the counter. I said no problem and proceeded to finish my take-out order. This goes to show that no matter how good the food is at a restaurant poor customer service will always lose future business. I gave this restaurant a three-star because the food is delicious but as of recently their customer service has deteriorated.
