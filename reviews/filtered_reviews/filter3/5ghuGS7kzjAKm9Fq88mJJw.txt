Grabbed a bite to eat here before departing.  Husband had Carne Asada tacos and I had spicy Smoked Chicken tacos.  Both of us enjoyed our lunch.  We did not get drinks.  Lisa was a great waitress.  My chicken was not spicy and the salsa had the tiniest kick at the end.  My husband thought his salsa was more like marinara.  Total ticket was $30 for one ice tea and 6 tacos with no sides.  But then again we are in an airport.
