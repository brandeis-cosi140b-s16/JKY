I was hoping I would like this place better, but that is not so.  After telling my husband that I was feeling particularly inclined to eat either Mexican ( a rare occurrence for me ) or Chinese food, he suggested Chino Bandido.  After a little bit of research on the internets I decided that there was something suitable for me there.

At first glance, the place looks seedy.  Upon closer inspection, it just looks dirty.  That didn't really bother me as some of the best food can come from the not so best looking conditions.  They haven't been shut down, so how bad can it be?  The way of ordering food here is a bit too complicated, you feel like you're taking a pop quiz you aren't prepared for.  The little sheet of paper you use to order just doesn't have very good instructions.  However, the girls working here were all very nice and helpful, and more than willing to dole out samples to anyone interested.  

I finally ordered the Jade Red Chicken with plain fried rice.  The rice definitely seemed like a fusion of the Asian and Mexican with the style being Chinese, but the flavor being very Mexican.  The chicken itself was rather tough, definitely not a high quality.  The crispiness of the batter was really good though.  The sauce that makes this Jade Red was described as sweet and sour with a kick.  Well, I missed the sweet and sour flavor.  It was more along the lines of just kick.  Now, I understand I have a low tolerance for spices, but this was over the top for me.  I will be back next time I am congested.  The snickerdoodle they served with your meal is the bomb though.  Yum.

Overall, I am not really impressed.  Creative, but not something I'm really feeling.  I think I may check out the Chandler location to give this place another shot.  A pretty decent place that I guess is worth checking out, if only to laugh at the giant strapped panda bear statue inside.
