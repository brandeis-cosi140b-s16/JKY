Middle of the road Tex-Mex food. You get large portions for good prices. The complimentary chips and salsa are decent- a good heat to the salsa. I've tried a few things on the menu- from their chicken burritos to the steak enchiladas and tacos, served with rice and choice of bean. It's all pretty good- better than some but just not as good as other chains (Abuelos). 

They typically have decent beers on tap, so ask your server what's available. Get the Dos Equis Amber with a lime! The margaritas are good- you get what you pay for. The cheaper house margarita is pretty weak, add a better tequila for a tastier drink! This place is definitely kid friendly with a special menu, and there's plenty of room so they can blend in with the white noise. Have fun!!
