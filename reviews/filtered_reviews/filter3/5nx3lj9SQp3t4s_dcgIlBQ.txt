Went to Richardson's with 2 other couples to specifically get authentic New Mexico Mexican cuisine. Since one couple are natives of Santa Fe we knew what we were after. Hatch green chili and chimayo red chili sauce. The food delivered, highly recommend the Carne Adovada which was amazing.  If the service would have been good I easily would have rated the restaurant a 4 or 5. Slow service and the waitress acted like we were a major inconvenience. We arrived at 9pm which for us is not an untypical dining hour so I'm not giving them a pass based on the time. We get great service at many other local places at this time.
