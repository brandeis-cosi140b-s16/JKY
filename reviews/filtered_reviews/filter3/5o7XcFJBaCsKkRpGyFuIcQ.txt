Ok,  3 visits and here is my opinion: it's just ok.   I like the weekly burger idea. Order at the counter,  no ambiance, next to drive thru liquor  (that may appeal to some) prices high for a burger that leaves you hungry.  Same guy has always taken my order, likely the owner/partner - decent fella.  I've had one of thier signature burgers (beach house) that put them on the map and man it was just ok.  Fries ok. Shakes decent.  I most liked the country fried burger.   They do put a bit of a "presentation" effort into thier burgers.  For the same $ give or take a couple bucks - my goodness there are definately  better burgers that will also include the full package experience of a meal, flavor as well fill you up.  I'm beside myself with some of the stellar reviews and it was those that kept me coming back to see what I was missing.  I wasn't missing anything, sorry PVBC and its fans.  I just had a double burger and I'm starving!
