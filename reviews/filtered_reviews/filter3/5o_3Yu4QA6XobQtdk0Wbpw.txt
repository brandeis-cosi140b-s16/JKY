I came here on a date one time with a girl I'd just met. I figured I would try this place because it seemed good, so if the date went south, at least the food would make my night better, right? 

End result: ok date, ok meal.

It's not that the food is bad here, or that the portions are poor, or that the service was bad. Everything was just pretty good. It was good enough that I would come here again if I were hungry and already at the Palms, but it's not somewhere I would bring a special lady or someone else I might try to impress. It's just not impressive like that.

I will say, however, that the service was pretty good. I never had an empty water glass, and I was offered another margarita/cerveza as soon as I'd had 80% of the current one. That's what makes this place three stars instead of two.
