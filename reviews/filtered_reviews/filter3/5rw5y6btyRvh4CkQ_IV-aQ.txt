My first experience here wasn't bad ... I just thought the food was OK on average. Nothing to special about it. It's pretty much your typical American Mexican joint. From the name, I guess I was just expecting a lot. 

Location - located on a strip mall right next to a gas station and other food joints. Corner of Decatur and Sunset.

Atmosphere - the place is small but it's pretty clean and cozy. It was pretty busy when I went during lunch hour. 

Food - I'm a nocturnal type of person so I always wake up late. I was craving some type of Mexican breakfast and I came across this place. I had the Chorizo breakfast burrito with a side of Barbacoa taco. Like I mentioned earlier, I thought the food was average. Prices are decent and it's something you'd expect from a place like this. I've had better ones at a local Roberto's ... 

Service - no complaints on service. It's the typical order from the counter, pay and they'll being the food to you type of shindig. It was pretty prompt and the lady was quite nice. 

Overall, I'd probably give this place another go. Maybe for something quick or maybe to try their famous chocolate drizzled churro. If you're looking for Mexican food or some type of Mex fusion, I'd go somewhere else...
