Wandering around the Strip for hours, you can work up quite an appetite.  This happened to us on a recent Sunday afternoon.  We decided to stumble down the half darken stairs to give Casa Reyna a try.

This place has a surprisingly cute interior.  Loved the murals and the huge wooden tables and chairs.  Our server was efficient and friendly.  

We started with XX lager, Mexican Coke and elotes dip served with chips.  Loved it.  I got the Aztec soup, just the right amount of spicey hotness.  It was incredible.  BJ got a South salad.  He thought it was okay.  I got mini shrimp tacos.  Just a little bland.

For dessert, we shared a Tres Leches cake.  It was okay.  Not stellar.  I am thinking that other than the soup and dip, we may have ordered the wrong things.
