Beyond the language barrier, the food is delicious.  The tacos are hearty and ingredients fresh.  When I ask for a side of pico de gallo and jalapenos, they really dish out the sides.  They don't have pico pre-made, but I was given cilantro, onions and tomatoes in separate souffle cups.

Unfortunately, the last time I stopped in for lunch take away, there was a bit of a problem with the language barrier.  I ended up with jalapeno POPPERS, not jalapenos for my tacos. I knew this was a mix up because of the total bill, but I decided rather than trying to explain I just sucked it up.  (I tried one of the poppers, WAY TOO OVER FRIED.)

Beyond all that, I tried Fausto's the other day on the suggestion of Yelp! and was disappointed. I'll stick with El Torito and take my chances.

I'm being generous, because of how awesome the food was the first time. (try the carne asada!)
