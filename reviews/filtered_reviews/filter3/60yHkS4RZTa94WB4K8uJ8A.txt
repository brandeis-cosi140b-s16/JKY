Tried out this place for a Sunday brunch. Instantly loved the atmosphere and the decor, especially with how sunny it is. It is a very small place and they had a DJ playing some salsa music. The small space did not seem to warrant an entire DJ set-up in the corner but it added some charm.

I ordered the pork belly eggs Benedict. I enjoyed them well enough but I was distracted by the presentation. My plate was huge, like it must have been at least 12 inches by 12 inches. Then smack dab in the center are the two muffin halves. There are no side dishes or other accouterments on the dish, so it only takes up maybe about 1/6 of the plate. I am a firm believer in quality over quantity, but it just seemed so bizarre to have a fairly small item to be on a plate the size of Texas. In a way, it almost made me feel like I was ripped off...like something else was being left off of the plate or that my dish is not worth the value. This was all due to the presentation because it was plenty of food for me. It also made it awkward trying to fit my coffee cup and water glass on the table top as I started running out of room. 

I did not indulge in any alcoholic beverages because I was nursing a hangover but their coffee was delicious. I was also able to sample their bread pudding. That was seriously my favorite of the morning and I am not even a dessert person whatsoever.
