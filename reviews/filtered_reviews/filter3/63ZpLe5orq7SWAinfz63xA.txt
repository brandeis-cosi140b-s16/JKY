Food's good, not great but good. Standout dish is the Barbacoa...seriously worth trying. My brother was served his shrimp burrito with shrimp tails still on the little guys, which made for a crunchy(not to mention inconvenient) experience. Cost is reasonable......for Vegas.

The cocktails were very good, the classic margarita and the michelada were ordered several times at our table with no complaints. NOTE: they do a happy hour until 7pm on most nights, but only at the bar!! The happy hour price is nearly 50% off on the margaritas, if your looking to save a buck. If your not eating dinner, they serve drinks in TO-GO cups even at happy hour prices.....very nice!

The best thing about this place is the location inside the Venetian, if you get a table on the "patio"(which means its not the bar area, hence not included in happy hour) you can sit right next to the water for the Gondola rides and listen to them sing(and watch the couples awkwardly stare at each other.... whilst taking their romantic trip in a circle..... through a hotel made to look like Venice, Italy) . It makes for a bit of a romantic dinner if your into that sort of thing, or at the very least some awesome people watching(im a fan). 

BOTTOM LINE: have a cocktail before seven, share an entree or the guaco and chips, sit back/relax and have a gander(or a laugh) over the lovely Gondoliers and their customers.
