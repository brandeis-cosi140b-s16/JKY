Probably the worst fajitas I've ever had in my life. Hard to mess up fajitas, but they did. The place was exceeding loud/noisy, and the service really slow. However, I gave them three stars because for some reason when we got the bill it was 50% off!  So we got what we paid for! Got to work on those fajitas though...
