I can see myself coming here and have drinks with friends. The atmosphere is upbeat and could maintain a party attitude, but I wouldnt come here for a meal. This time I did, but that was because I wanted to try the food, and while it wasnt bad - it really wasnt any different from any other of the quasi-mexican bar/restaurants that we have an abundance of here in the valley. 

The variety of snack food and drinks works, and the service was nice enough. It will have to be quite a party for me to come back here. With that said, I will not actively find reasons not to come back.
