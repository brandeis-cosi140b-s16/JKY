I had been waiting for this restaurant to open because I believe that Asian and Latin food fusion makes a great combination.  We went there first for happy hour; since I couldn't stay long, I ordered the mushroom tacos.  The mushrooms were delicious but nothing on the menu said it would be spicy - but it was VERY spicy.  Finally figured out that the onions are pickled with serrano chilis and that's probably what I bit into that made the taco so SPICY.
Next time, I asked that they "hold" anything spicy but the kitchen can't seem to know what is spicy and and what is not.  According the bartender: "Well, what's spicy to you, may not be spicy to them" and that's when I decided that as good as a couple of the dishes I've had, it wasn't going to be the next great find in my list.
The kitchen can manage to make the Pad Thai al Pastor mild enough for me to enjoy and in another visit I also enjoyed the Chicharron de Pollo that I ordered and shared with my friend.  She ordered the Bacon Wrapped Medjool Dates.  The Guacamoles were not dissappointing but again, very spicy.  We tried the Lump Crab and Bacon.
There was one dish (I believe it was the meatballs with soup) that apparently taken out of the menu because in the 5 times I went there, they were never serving it.
I will likely go again as it seems to be popular with my friends but unfortunately, not the place I expected.
