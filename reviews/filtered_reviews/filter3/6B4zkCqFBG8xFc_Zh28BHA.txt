This is one of my favorite places to eat tacos in San Diego, the quality of the food at this Vegas location is not the same.  The sauce used on the adobada tacos lacks flavor, the meat is cut into small cubes vs strips like in San Diego. The  tortillas are cold.  This place is just too busy, I think it suffers because of that. If you are craving an OK taco, then this place will do just fine.  The wait is not worth the taste.
