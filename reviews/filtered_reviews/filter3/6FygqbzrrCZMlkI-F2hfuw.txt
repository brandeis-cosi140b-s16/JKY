Interesting location - shares parking lot with Sapphire Gentlemen's Club- but was off the strip, so thought we would give it a try based on the previous reviews. The inside atmosphere is really nice; roomy, decorated well, and comfortable. Would have preferred to sit in the main dining room, but for whatever reason, we were seated in the back area next to a bachelorette party. Tableside guacamole was just "ok"- very chunky and lacking lime and cilantro.I also  found it odd that that they don't have a separate individual make the guac- each server makes it for their own tables. We had a steak bowl and 3 tacos- 2 chicken and a fish.  All dishes were flavorful and the cilantro rice that came with the tacos was delicious. Margaritas were nothing to write home about at $14 each. I would not recommend the raspberry one as it had absolutely no flavor. Dining companion liked his jalepeno margarita. Checked in with Yelp and chef brought out a complimentary flan.  Wow!  I typically don't like flan at all but this was fantastic. Nice touch that chef Jorge brought it out himself and gave us his card as well. Overall, good meal, but pricey for Mexican food.
