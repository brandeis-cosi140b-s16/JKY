Let me start by saying Tee is the nicest person an great customer service!! Ok that said the meats are outta this world good!! But for some reason they leave the lids off of the hot food line ALL the time! An wat that does is turn the food (mainly the rice) into rocks! U can just look at the spoon an see how crusty hard the rice has gotten. Same way with the meat. It's ashamed cause the cooks (especially Guy) make some of the tastiest meats on this planet. Unfortunately I now have to get shredded lettuce instead of rice. Been burnt to many times telling me the rice is fresh. Nothing worse than eating lil pebbles in ur burrito. Wich btw are huge! So it's 5s for the food but 1 after its in the hands of the counter people. Ps. I eat there about 5xs a week. Fix this prob an it'll be 7xs a week
