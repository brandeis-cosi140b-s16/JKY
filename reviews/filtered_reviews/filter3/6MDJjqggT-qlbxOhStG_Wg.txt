Let's start with the pros. 

The tacos al pastor were well executed although the tortilla was crumbly. I assume that they were fresh made and if the dough gets a little dry, that's the outcome. I would also get rid of the avocado.

The bacon guacamole was also good.

I asked for a sample of the strawberry gazpacho and it was tasteful but I guess a whole bowl would be really overwhelming. A shot is the perfect size for this dish, IMHO.

The bacon wrapped dates... mixed feelings.

And the porkbelly ramen noodles was highly disappointing. 

The location is awesome, the build out is beautiful and it has a great patio. I was tempted to give them a 4th star just for that, but I guess I would be bias and would mislead whoever reads this.

However I say, give it a try. I will go back to try the sushi.

Cheers.
