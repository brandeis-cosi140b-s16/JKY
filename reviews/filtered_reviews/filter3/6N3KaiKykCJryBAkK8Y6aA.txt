My favorite part of this meal was the warm (flash fried?) tortilla chips with guacamole. Please order the guacamole to start off!! The salsa was also pretty tasty.

Now to the tacos, I ordered my usual chicken, beef, pork, and they were decent. Tacos are served on lightly toasted corn tortillas with a spoonful of onion and cilantro tossed on - just how I like my tacos. None of the flavors in the tacos were that memorable and I ended up adding more hot sauce to spruce them up. Hot sauce isn't on the table, but they'll bring it out if asked. 

Isaac ordered the carnitas special, which had a bit more fatty sections than either one of us preferred.

Atmosphere - small, cozy and clean. 
Service - quick and friendly, even with most of the tables filled.
Cost - cheap

Overall - I'd eat here again, but maybe try one of their specialties instead of the tacos.
