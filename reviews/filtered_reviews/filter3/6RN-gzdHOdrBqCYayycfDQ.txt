I went here to use a Groupon a couple weeks ago (can't believe I forgot to review it!). We got there fairly early and the place was empty. I found that to be kind of awkward. Anyway, The BF and I both got taco plates. I got the pork and the gaucho tacos. The pork was alright, very tender and the flavor was decent - a little sweet a little spicy, but the gaucho was pretty not good. There was something incredibly sweet about it...I did not like it at all, and I love chimichurri sauce. Their salsa bar is fabulous! I liked the pecan salsa and the tomatillo. I thought the strawberry salsa was odd...not my cup of tea. The salsa was the best part of the meal. I also had the horchata.....I did not care for it. The fruit and nuts in it did not add to the flavor and it was served luke warm...not so good. I do not know that I would go back.
