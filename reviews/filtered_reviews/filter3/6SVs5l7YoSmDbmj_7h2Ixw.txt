I had lunch here with a group of 5.  I wouldn't get the Tarascan soup again, but I did like my Cabo Ahi Tuna.  if I were to go back to this place, I probably wouldn't order anything else because the rest of my group, who got more traditional mexican dishes like Enchiladas, did not like their entrees very much.

The service was pretty shaky, too.  Our waiter even stumbled over his own name, let alone the drink orders!
