The horchata is amazing! The food is good. The salsa bar is fun. The service is iffy. The prices are starting to drive me nuts. I've been coming here since just after it first opened as "La Condesa," because it's down the street from my house and I could walk. It was good, unpretentious,  and reasonably priced. They have changed their menu at least 4 times since they first opened. I appreciate the added variety, but not the price jumps. One taco used to fill me up and I could get it for under three bucks. Now I have no idea what they charge, so I only go when I'm fine with spending 8 bucks on a cheese quesadilla (which I will say is very delicious but not really worth $8 all by itself). Anyhow, try it, because the food is good, and leave other expectations at the door.
