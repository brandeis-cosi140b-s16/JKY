Jose the waiter hands down understands customer service even with a one time bad experience here at La Pi√±ata. However, I beg to differ on behalf of the co-owner Ramona. After submitting a complaint to avoid future "complaints" about a stale taco ($3.95) she became abrupt stating you ate 3/4 of it. Agreeing to her rebuttal, I clarified I'm still paying for it. I don't want to exchange I'm simply telling you it was stale she continued to argue. My husband then interjected "it was stale" then she reprieved, no apology, no acknowledgement. 

Customer service goes a long way especially when restaurants like Oaxaca's closes down because of the economy as I just found out. Thank-you Jose for apologizing because of your courtesy I still give the restaurant three stars and recommend the food!
