The Taco Guild is just ok. I really, really wanted to like this place, but the food and service aren't all that great. The building is awesome. Some really cool historical features were kept, and they did a great job with the decor, but unfortunately it doesn't really make up for what they lack in the food and service departments.  My only complaint with the building was it was really loud. The place wasn't half full, and I could barely hear my dining partner. 

There wasn't anything exceptionally bad about the service, it just wasn't good. It took them forever to greet us, and then to take our order. Drinks and food took a long time to come  and they switched servers halfway through our meal (which was at like 7:30). 

Chips and salsa were good (often a determining factor as to if we go back), but none of the tacos really stood out. The lamb and cherry steak were the only tacos we actually liked. The snapper was awful, and the pastor, coffee braised beef, and duck tacos were mediocre at best. And the sides...I opted for the onion strings and the little lady got the corn.  Both very boring. The only other options were beans or rice (not and).  I like beans and rice, but find both uninspiring by themselves. 

I would love to go back to this place, but with so many great places around (including Gadzooks across the street), I don't know how I can justify it. Maybe for drinks one day...
