I went here last night with my man and a friend because our friend likes spicy food.  The last time we were here even the beans were spicy so we thought we'd take him to try it out.

You get seated and they give you glasses and a pitcher of water right away.  I figure they do this because they know you'll be crying for water very shortly once you try the salsa.  Let me tell you, the salsa is hot!   Both the red and green are hot.  The chips are thin, warm and crispy.  The service was great.  They were right on top of things and kept our drinks full and our chip bowl stocked.

I ordered a taco, tostada and beans (no rice).   I expected the beans to be your typical refried beans with a kick but these were whole beans.  They were okay but I prefer the typical style.  These beans were not spicy at all.  I was kind of relieved because my mouth was burning from the salsa.  The tostada was very tasty once I got the extra cheese I ordered.  The taco, unfortunately, was nothing to write home about, and that's a bummer because tacos are my favorite.  I am not a fan of their beef for their tacos.  I like shredded beef and this was more like a juicy ground beef.  Not a deal breaker but I would love to have shredded beef as an option.

Our friend ordered a Mexican pizza and it was huge.  It used the same ground beef that they put in the tacos so it was just alright to me.  It was an ample serving though so this place gets points for that.  My friend didn't think any of the food was that spicy but he buys all the weird hot sauces on the market so I'm thinking he is desensitized.  

This place is A-OK to me.  The service was very fast on a Tuesday night.  Maybe I should have ordered the more spicy items for my meal but I don't think my tongue could have handled it, LOL.  It's definitely worth a try but I will be sticking with my regular Mexican food spot.
