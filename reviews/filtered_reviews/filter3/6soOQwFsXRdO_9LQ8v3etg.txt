Came here for brunch.  Got the Breakfast burrito.  Huge.  They should have a choice for half of one. But it was good, not great but good. Guacamole with bacon was good as well but not great.  Atmosphere was great of course because of the fact that is a an old church with some modern improvements. Service was OK, but not great. Bar looks great as well.  Overall I would say that I would come back but not in that big of a rush to do so.
