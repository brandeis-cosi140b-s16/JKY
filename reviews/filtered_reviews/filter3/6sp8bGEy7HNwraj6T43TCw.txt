Nothing amazing but pretty good Mexican food that is sort of like any of the large Mexican chains. The tacos were fresh, HOT, and had a good flavor. The rice and black beans were also pretty good. They used to offer free chips and salsa like most Mexican restaurants but now charge $2.99 for them.

This place isn't a must try in Vegas but if you're on the strip and want Mexican food you won't go wrong here.
