Writing review after three trips.  I love burritos, especially 'Breakfast' burritos.

First visit, I had an Egg & Chorizo burrito.  It was pretty good.  My lady's was egg, potato & cheese filled.  I helped her finish hers and it was dynamite.

Second visit, I ordered an egg, potato & cheese, myself.  Fantastic.  I knew it before but eggs, potatoes and cheese is what flour tortillas were made to be filled with.  The cheese they use isn't yellow, either.  (Yesss!)

Third visit, bacon, egg and cheese and had them add potato.  I thought this was going to be the ultimate.  However, the bacon inside seemed to be the precooked, crumbled kind.  Not like Bac-O-Bits but like the stuff that was once freshly crisped bacon but has since been tossed in a bag and sent to store shelves, next to bologna.

Honestly, the bacon thing isn't going to keep me away because the egg, potato & cheese burrito will keep me coming back.  Especially since there isn't a Federico's nearby

Oh, yeah.  The chips suck and the salsa is not bad but not great and everything else I've read others say.
