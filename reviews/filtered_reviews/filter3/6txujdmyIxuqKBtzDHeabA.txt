American Taco!
Please come to meee!
American Taco!
Papas let me bee!
Don't come hangin around my plate
I wanna see you in my belly not my face!
(American Woman Lyrics)

America's Taco Shop is actually named after a woman named America; not our country America.  America Corrales and her husband created this popular chain restaurant in several states and luckily Phoenix was one of them.  Voted best Phoenix Mexican food by Phoenix Magazine in 2011, this Taco shop definitely has a reputation of providing some pop and zing!

I ordered the Al Pastor Vampiros while my sister ordered the Carne Asada burritos.  The vampiros were marinated in a sauce that reminded me of the Chinese BBQ pork, yeah pretty weird, but overall I didn't think it was the kind of vampiros I was thinking about.  I thought it filled my belly that's about it.  My sister really likes the food here and her burrito was very good in her opinion.  We ordered a side of chips and salsa along with our food.  I had to add some extra spice to get some kick in the salsa.  

America's Taco Shop is home cooked recipes at a fast food pace.  Thus, you ordered at the counter and the food is brought out.  You can also place your orders online, which I thought was pretty cool.  The place itself is a dive and diner feel with a modern gloss.  One thing brought to my mind; stainless steel.  Like a modern kitchen this place is covered with stainless steel!  

I would say overall experience of this place is good.  I didn't really love it, but I would definitely come back because of its unique twist to Mexican food that I'm usually accustomed to. - Enjoy!
