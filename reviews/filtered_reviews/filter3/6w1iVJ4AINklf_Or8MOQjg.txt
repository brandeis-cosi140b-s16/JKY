First time eating here. I usually just get a beer and that's all cause the place is so crowded. Ate out on the patio where in the courtyard was a band playing so we couldn't hear ourselves talk. I ordered the southwestern salad. The chicken was very dry and tasteless. The fried salad bowl tasted like rubber and was not toasted or warmed up. I've had better bowls where you want to eat the whole thing. I actually got "tired" of eating my tasteless salad. Only good thing was the waitress.  She knew when to come by and ask us if we needed anything. She gave us extra napkins, filled our drinks just at the right time. I didn't like when she took my drink cause my salad was so dry that I needed to keep washing it down with something.
