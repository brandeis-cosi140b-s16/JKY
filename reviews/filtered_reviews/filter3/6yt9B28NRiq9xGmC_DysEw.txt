We came here based on all the favorable yelp reviews, the restaurant must have had a bad day because all of our dishes were less than average in terms of taste and quality.  The service was good and the atmosphere pleasant.  The food however just did not have that wow factor but it did have value (lunch menu).  I imagine that dinner there with musical entertainment can be special, their walls have some impressive photos of VIPs.
