What gave me the push to finally try this place was their enticing three course meal special. We also had a coupon for a free spinach con queso appetizer, which was fabulous. The salad, which was my first course, was pretty good. Our waiter rubbed me the wrong way early on, however, when I asked him what dressings they offered. He rolled his eyes at me and asked me if I wanted something creamy or something like Italian "cuz I don't wanna stand here and name them all." Excuse me, is that not part of your job to tell patrons what their salad dressing choices are?! I didn't understand the big deal, especially after he eventually rattled off all the dressings in fewer than five seconds. The food was delivered quickly, which was impressive. Granted the restaurant was far from packed on the particular Wednesday we went for an early dinner. My second course was a chicken dish. It was supposed to be spicy, but was far from it. The portion size was decent, though. Rice, beans, salsa...All average taste, not spectacular by any means. My third course, the pumpkin flan, was delicious. I just wish the size of the flan they served me was doubled. So puny! Am I in a rush to get back here? No. Did I hate it? No. At least I know which dressing I will be ordering for my salad whenever I go to Macayo's next so I won't be inconveniencing our server!
