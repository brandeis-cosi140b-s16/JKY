While there were some things I very much liked about our experience at Lindo Michoacan, there were a few other things that definitely keep me from giving it more than three stars.

First, the location and atmosphere are great. Right off of the 215 and Flamingo, this (relatively) new building has a great dining room right off the front door, as well as a dining area off of the bar. The area off the bar has a small stage with live music which adds a lot to the atmosphere, especially for a restaurant in Vegas.  Our waiter was excellent - attentive, communicative and treated my daughters (3 and 5 years old) very well.

Overall we had a good dinner, though there are a few things I wasn't 100% happy with. Though we ordered our dinners clearly and everyone understood the changes, the kitchen just made them the way they always do, and two meals had to be sent back. It obviously wasn't the waiter's fault (he apologized profusely), but he didn't catch it before the dinners came to the table. Unfortunately one of the wrong meals was for my 3 year old, which made dinner all the more difficult for us.

The menu is extensive and all of the meals were prepared well, though none were particularly hot. The soup was a favorite of the table and my carnitas dish was good, though not as savory as I would have liked.

We'll definitely come back again sometime, if anything to see if things are a little better (and to try new dishes), but for now, it gets three stars.
