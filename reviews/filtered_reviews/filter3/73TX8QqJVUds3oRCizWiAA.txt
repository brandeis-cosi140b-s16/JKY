Friday night at 630pm was told wait would be 30 min. Lots of people waiting, to be expected.  Checked the bar for open seat and noticed half the tables in restaurant were empty.  Wait was as they said, service was very slow. Place is not as good as it used to be. I would go to Ajo Als on the other side of the mall for better food and service.
