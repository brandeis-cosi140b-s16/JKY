Ordered the bulgogi fries and kimchi fried rice, and was not that impressed. Plus, my husband got sick after eating it and was in the bathroom the rest of the night.

Also, it's located in a sketchy shopping center. We're willing to give it another try because I love Asian fusion.. but probably not anytime soon.
