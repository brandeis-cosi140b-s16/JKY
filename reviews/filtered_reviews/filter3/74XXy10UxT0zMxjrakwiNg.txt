I really wanted to fall in love with this place but unfortunately it did not impress me as I expected.  Yeah the parking is bad and the store front is somewhat hidden in a sketchy part of Phoenix (all quirks of great spots) but I felt like there was something missing.  I was all excited to try some new dishes and have a cool unique dining experience.  The interior is very reminiscent of a quaint mom and pop restaurant.  The idea of the guac made at your table side is great and it did taste pretty good but it was certainly not worth the price.  I ordered the shrimp tacos and there was so much sauce on it that it was getting all over the place (namely my face)!  The dish did taste good but I am not a fan of corn tortillas (and that's all they have here).   I did finish my meal but later on had the worst stomach pains (probably due to the assortment of flavors in the guac, the house salad and my shrimp tacos).      

Maybe I should give it another shot?  Possibly I should have ordered the fish tacos?  All I can think about now is that the shrimp tacos remind me of the shrimp quesadilla at Gecko Grill In Gilbert (and it's half the price and never made me sick).
