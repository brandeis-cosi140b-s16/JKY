We got takeout and shared the Carne Asada and Cochinita Pibil.  Considering the price I wouldn't say you get a ton of food.  They also could/should include some lime and cilantro since they give you tortillas and then you could make your own tacos.  

The Carne Asada was a bit better than the pork, which was a bit disappointing since pork is my favorite thing at almost all Mexican joints.  Everything is good enough just not nearly 4.5 stars good. Pork also a little dry.  

Also only 1 of the three salsas we got were any good at all.
