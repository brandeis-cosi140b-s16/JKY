Had the carnitas.  Great dish in concept, different than described in the menu.  It is actually German-style pork shank, rather than Mexican Carnitas.  Again, fine, but different than billed.  It was also overcooked and dry.  Menu is lengthy.  Too lengthy.  Bartender was terrible.  Lacked knowledge of the menu, and was too busy for her capabilities, even though the bar area was less than 50% capacity.  Leaves a lot to be desired compared to the Laguna and Crystal Cove CA., locations.  With so many choices in Vegas, I would not go out of my way to eat here.  I would never travel from another hotel or a residence in LV to eat here.
