PRO: Asian-Mexican fusion combo is really cool. I like how you could order both cuisines at one place. When you go in the bathrooms, the "wall paper" is a combination of chinese and mexican currencies, which was really cool. Great ambiance. The food was good also. 

CON: I don't know why I expected this place to have bigger portions for the prices, but my single little lobster taco was $10. My mom and I came here because we were starving and we didn't want to pay $25-$30 to go to a buffet, but in the long run it would have been a savings compared to how much food we had to order to fill us up at Chino Poblano. Everything is served tapas style - little plates, so it is very pretty and nicely presented (just expensive). If you're watching your cash I'd say don't come here, but it's nice if someone else is footing the bill for you or if you don't have to worry about cost. Otherwise to feel satisfied with what you eat, you'll prob pay at least $50 pp.
