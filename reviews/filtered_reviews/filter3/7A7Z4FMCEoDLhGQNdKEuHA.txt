It was alright. 

The salsa was actually pretty amazing but that is where the amazing stops. I ordered a combo plate with a tostado, taco, and enchilada. It arrived super soggy and not appetizing at all. The beans and rice were ok. 

The kids meals were just that. Kids meals. 

The winner of the night surprisingly was my sons plain nachos. Yep, they managed to get chips with melted cheese right.

The sopapillas were not good at all. 

Probably best to skip this joint really.
