Last night leaving this restaurant I was torn between giving this restaurant 3 or 4 stars. The food was OK, nothing spectacular, but not really bad either. The Cheese dip was very bland and very runny so I don't recommend that. The salsa was decent. I have enchiladas that again, we're OK but nothing go make them stand out and my fianc√©e had fiatas that were the same story. The service was really slow. We were in the restaurant for nearly 2 hours (not including our wait time) and our drinks ran empty several time and I just feel like we were placed on the back burner. But all in all, good enough for a 3 star I suppose...... Until this morning when we both woke up running to the bathroom.  It's definitely extremely rare for me to get sick from food so not sure what went wrong last night. I guess the best piece of advice I can give is to stay away from the chicken. We however will not be returning.

Update:
After a little over 2 weeks, the manager/owner messaged me apologizing for the issues and tried to make things right. This means a lot so I've taken the score from a 1 star to a 3 star. Hopefully this was a one off situation where we got sick.
