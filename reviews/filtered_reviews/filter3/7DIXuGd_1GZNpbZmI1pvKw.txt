Came here not knowing what to expect. I don't drink, so the abundance of alcohol (mostly tequila) was not something that enticed me about this establishment. Customers who drink would probably enjoy it more. Pretty cool design inside though. The tacos are pretty good, the rice isn't great, but the black beans are delicious.
