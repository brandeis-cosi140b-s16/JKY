This restaurant has some very tasty items, none of which contain its red, spicy sauce.

My boyfriend and I tried this place randomly since I moved to a new neighborhood.  We did take out and were glad when we some the small, crowded and warm interior.  It was dark and very tight.  Which is fine if that's your thing!

As a vegetarian, my options were limited, but that has never stopped me before.  I ordered the mushroom tamales.  They might be good with a different sauce, but apparently there are two options: meat, and really freaking spicy.  I couldn't even eat it.  It wasn't the tastes-good-underneath-the-pain kind of spicy, it tasted like some spice (paprika?) that just tasted like crap and pain.  I rarely dislike food, and almost never don't eat things, but those tamales were not happening.  

We also ordered an order of toasted garlic, which was really, really good.  It came with way more bread than we could hope to eat.  Seriously amazing sauce, vegetables, garlic and I don't know what all else.  

My boyfriend got the tomatillo toast, which sounded and looked amazing.  He said it was delicious, and we both want to give this place another try.  I am just staying far, far away from anything red and or spicy.
