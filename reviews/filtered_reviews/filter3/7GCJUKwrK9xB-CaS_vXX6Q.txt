I guess I'm not ordering the "right" things because this place, to me, is good but not great.

I have been here probably 4 times, every time the service was very good.  No complaints on service.  The salsa is good, beans and rice are "ok" but not great.  I've had the fajitas twice, a burro enchilada style, and a taco plate.  Everything was just "ok".  Nothing stood out to me as "damn that's good".

Yeah the building looks nice, interior is well done.  Bar is nice, margaritas are good (when are they not?).  Whatever, just another Mexican place in the Valley.
