The food was fine, but this stuff wouldn't cut the muster if you tried to serve it here in my home of Austin, TX.

The horchata? About three times too sweet. Completely undrinkable.

The carne asada "Vampiro" I ordered was good, but the finely-diced iceberg lettuce mounded on top was ... odd. I've never seen diced lettuce in Mexican food before; maybe it's an Arizona thing. Certainly doesn't do anything for the taste, texture or presentation of the food.

Beware: As Chris L. points out, the tacos come with ingredients not listed on the menu (lettuce and guacamole).

These are small gripes though; as I said, the food was fine. A little more heat (are peppers just unheard of in Mexican food in Arizona?) and fewer surprises on the menu would go a long way toward making this place great.
