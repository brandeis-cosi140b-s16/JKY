Happy hour is the best thing about this place so far, because originally the prices are  a little high.  My husband had the big ass burrito and for $10 it was really small and full of a lot of rice.  We've also seen bigger burritos at say, Chipotle even. 

The quesedillas are good, but they're a bit too greasy, and the chicken is that shreddy texture that I don't really like.  

I'd go back but for happy hour only, even though there's only one mixed drink that's half off and only appetizers are half off.
