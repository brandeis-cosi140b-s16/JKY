Valentines 2/14/11

Bopped in here for a quick margarita tonight before we left the strip. I have only had a full meal here once but the burrito I had was $15 and worth every penny. The burrito was double the size of a Chipotle style and even more tasty. Margaritas are decent price for being apart of the Mandalay Bay chain as well as the authentic tacos. 

Mostly a noisy bar atmosphere but well decorated with a great friendly staff.

Good place to catch a quick drink of a meal before heading out on the strip.
