I had high hopes for this popular Dilworth spot. Overall service and ambiance was great, but the food didn't quite live up to my standards for "authentic" Mexican cuisine. 

The table side guacamole was well done and I enjoyed my tequila flight, but my main dish--enchiladas de pollo--was kind of a cheese-drowned mess. I enjoy cheese as much as the next guy, but not when it's used to bludgeon your taste buds into submission rather than as a complement to a well-flavored dish. 

The rest of my party seemed to enjoy their meals, and I hear good things about the barbacoa, so I'll probably give Cantina another shot.
