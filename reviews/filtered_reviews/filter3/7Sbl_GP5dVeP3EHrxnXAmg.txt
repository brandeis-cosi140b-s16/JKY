I caught the eye of a hostess and she met me at the steps outside, she walked us in through the Large glass patio doors into the restaurant and seated us at an entry table with a view of the outdoor fireplace.  The employees were hip, the music was great, it was semi crowded, nice vibe and lighting.  Our waitress Adrianne was awesome, the drinks were good!  I/we were really enjoying this place.   After drinks and appetizer the outdoor temperature dropped and it was time for them to shut the doors to the outside - they didn't - not a good move (granted the outdoor tables had standing heaters).  Then came the food!  The standard tacos I'd eat again (but there are other places Id go to first), the shrimp and crunchy fish - nah.  The rice didn't have any flavor?  My opinion was shared with my company whom also ordered 3 tacos each with a variation.  Our table was cleared and were clearly done and after about 15 minutes we were informed there was a shift switch and they were sorry.  Then this was followed by almost 10 minutes to get my credit card back?  I understand people make mistakes, have bad days and all that - but service and food just was not up to par or worthy of the $ on this occasion.  Started strong ended really weak.  Bummer.
