Love this place -- good, consistent quality food, great menu, friendly service -- but oh my stars and garters, the prices are certainly high.  $13 is too much for a burrito with just rice and beans on the side!  Also, they used to have an amazing prickly pear flan but they changed it and now it's too sweet and doesn't have the right texture for a flan. The chicken-fried chicken meal is still a good deal, though.
