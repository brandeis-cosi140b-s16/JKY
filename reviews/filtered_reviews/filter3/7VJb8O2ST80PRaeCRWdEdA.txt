Met a friend here for lunch.  It was not as packed as I thought it would be.  It was nice, walked in grab a table, and the server immediately stopped by to say hello and ask what I would like to drink.  

The corn bread was SO SO good!!!  I ordered from the specialities section of the menu.  Five cheese macaroni & achiote chicken (made with bleu, Jack, cheddar, parmesan and Romano cheeses, finished with toasted bacon gratin).  It was pretty good.
