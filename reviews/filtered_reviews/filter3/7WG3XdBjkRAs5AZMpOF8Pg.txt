My husband & I met our friends Matt & Brooke here for lunch yesterday afternoon, so we could give them a present since I missed her baby shower the week before. 

We met them there & the salsa/bean dip & chips were already on the table, they also ordered a side of guacamole. This was only my 2nd time here & the boys 1st so we had a hard time deciding. Brooke loves this place so she already knew what she wanted before we got there. We all liked how there were pics of each item on the menu. We finally decided; Nick ordered chicken tacos, Matt ordered a beef chimichanga, Brooke ordered beef & chicken enchiladas & I ordered the Arriba pollo con queso (a specialty item). We all enjoyed our meals, except for Matt. His chimichanga had ground beef in it. I told him he should have got shredded, it's so much better!

Service was a bit on the slow side, which seemed odd for the place being practically empty on a Sunday around 3pm. But our server was nice & he always made sure to refill our drinks. Our total (plus tip) came to an even $80, not too bad but a little steep for lunch. 

Overall, we'd come back. Curious to try their beer that they brew right there in the restaurant & the desserts looked tasty as well.
