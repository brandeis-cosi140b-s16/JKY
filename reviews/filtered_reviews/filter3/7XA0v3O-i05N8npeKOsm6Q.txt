Not a bad place to come to grab some Mexican food on the strip or if you're staying at any of the south end properties.  

We came on a Friday night and ended up getting a table for 14 with no problem and without a wait.  Mariachis come by and are real personable.  Prices are decent for the strip, but high end just for regular Mexican food.  Suggest getting the coupon book they give in the hotels and getting a discount on your meal.

Service was also great.
