I cant say i was amazed! The salsa was good/average likely and the food was about standard, nothing that i would write a 5-start review about. .we ordered the app sampler plater, everything was covered in beans and lettuce, it didnt seem as if there was much attention to detail or taste. I will have to be in a generous mood to give it another shot. .
