I went there last night, and it was my first time going. The food was good, but the customer service needs improvement. Even after most people left, the waiter kept forgetting about my table. Don't recommend this place if you're in a hurry. I would go definitely go back for the food. I ordered the Carne Asada Tacos, Pork Belly Tacos, and the Tres Leches French Toast. Hopefully the service improves by the time I go back.
