My review:

Please understand that I am a hard rater.  I rarely award more than 3 stars.  My definition of 3 stars is a good, solid meal with good service.  It is a place that I recommend you try and a place I will likely return to.  

The food here was tasty and the value for what you pay is within reason.  The staff was friendly and attentive.  Both made for a positive dining experience.

Tonight I had the carnitas.  Yum!

Take a chance and eat here.  I think you will enjoy it.  Tell them Chris S. from Yelp sent you.  They will have no idea who the hell I am but you may get a good laugh out of it!  Enjoy!
