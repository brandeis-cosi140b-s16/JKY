Was there just drinking. Being local I was disappointed that they don't have any local deals. Seriously.. I have no beef punishing the tourists but.. come on.. I am local! LOL.. Spoiled huh? Anyhow say up on the deck overlooking the strip. I liked the setup very much. Big roomie area nice big chairs and couches for kicking back. Now, the server was super cool. Funny thing was apparently she was not so nice to some out of town friends we were meeting there, but once we sat down and chatter her up she was super cool. Even comped a drink or two for us and made things more comfy on the bill. I would go back for sure.. Enjoy..
