The Chinese-Mex concept is def interesting, but I agree with reviewers before me in that the food did not necessarily live up to expectation. Which is not to say that it was bad... just that there wasn't anything of note.

My hot & sour soup was neither particularly spicy nor sour... but it was noticeably oily and somewhat lacking in traditional seasonings. 

On top of that, the food was overpriced for the portion sizes... if anything, the only thing I could say that was good about the price was that they decided to be cute with the Chinese side of the menu and make things $X.88 ... i.e. my soup was $8.88 --- my friend's dish was $12.88 ...  for those not in the know, 8 is a lucky # in Chinese culture... so - good try to be "in touch" and cute, but maybe knock down that first # by a few digits and then we can try to be friends.
