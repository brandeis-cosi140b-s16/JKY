I enjoyed my visit to Los Olivos Norte, but I felt that with a little more effort it could have been much, much better.  We visited during happy hour, and while the drink specials (additional food specials available for patrons in the bar area) were actually quite good, I found the service to be mediocre and the servers to be, hmmmmmm, lack-luster.  Smile.  Have fun.  Tell me it's Happy Hous, offer me a premium margarita or some other whimsical beverage...make me feel special!!  :)  The food was good, but not great.  With so many dining options in the area, I don't see myself dining at here again unless they step up the service a notch or two.
