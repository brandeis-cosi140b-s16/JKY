My hubby had a hankering for Mex for dinner. We have been here a couple of times and I have to say the food is "ok". 

My hubby's cheese enchiladas didn't provide him with enough flavor. He thought the sauce could have been better. He also said the beans & rice were bland. I got the Burrito Light. It was good but could use something to add more flavor to it as well. 

The tastiest part of the meal was the chips and salsa.

Service was very good tho.
