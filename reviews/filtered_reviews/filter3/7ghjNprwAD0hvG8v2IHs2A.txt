I tried this place several months back and was pleased.  We were on this side of ton after picking out some flooring and decided to stop in for dinner. This wasn't the same experience as the last. 

Started out with "Chili Con Queso". This was very cheesy and delicious.

The prices seem to have gone up. I ordered the same thing as last time "Enchiladas Real" which is simply 2 cheese enchiladas and some rice and beans. It went from $9.99 the last time to $13.00. I asked the server to have them made with flour tortillas instead of corn. When he brought out our food he even said they were made with flour tortilla as he set them down so I knew he heard my order correctly. By this time he has walked away and my soda cup still empty. As I bite into my enchilada I taste that it was not made with flour tortillas. I had to wait 10 minutes until he came back to check on us to tell him about it. By this time the rest of my party had practically finished what they were eating. When I told the server he was very apologetic that it was wrong but never remade it! I still haven't gotten a refill on my drink by the way. When the server came to clear out table he saw i didn't eat my food except for the 1 bite. He offered to give me dessert to make it right. I said that was OK I would rather the meal just be taken off the check. 5 minutes later he brings an amazing looking ice cream. It was delicious and very thoughtful but being honest here he should have simply removed the meal from the check. 

The restaurant was clean and the food I did eat was good. My main complaint is with the service and how they choose to handle things. With the expensive prices it might just be worth skipping the future.
