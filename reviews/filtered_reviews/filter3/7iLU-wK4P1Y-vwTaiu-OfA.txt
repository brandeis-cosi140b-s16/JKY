This place was recommended to me by one of my neighbors as the "go to " mexican place to eat with my family, so i decided to give it a try.

The food was very tasty, I had the chicken burro. You get so much for the money which is a good thing in these economic times!  The premade magaritas will make you smack yo mama. Mango is my absolute favorite.  Give the other flavors a try, you may find your as well. 

One flaw that I found was the dirty menus, but all in all, a good place to take a hot date if you enjoy a romantic atmosphere with desert landscaping out in the sticks....Peace
