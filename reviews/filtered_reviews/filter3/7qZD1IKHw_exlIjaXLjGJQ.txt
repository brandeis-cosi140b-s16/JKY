Cool little spot. Nice ambience. The food is ok. One friend ordered the chile relleano and sent it back. She said it was dry. The other two friends ordered the taco trio. Both said fish taco was dry, but the shrimp and carnitas was good. I ordered the drunken chicken nachos. Excellent flavor, but a little skimpy on the chicken for $14. The highlight of the night was the flan! Very good. Music is on point! Friendly service and fast. Almost a little too fast. Made me wonder if the food was just sitting there.
