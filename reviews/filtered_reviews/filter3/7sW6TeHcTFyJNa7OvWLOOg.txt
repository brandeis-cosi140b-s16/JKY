I come to Carlos O'Briens periodically - maybe annually, sometimes more, sometimes less. It's a good restaurant. The food is good (not incredible, but a solid good) with large portions (I never finishe a meal). Very American style rather than traditional food with the typical dishes - tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, etc. They go heavy on the cheese - it doesn't bother me, but it has bothered folks I have gone with. Otherwise, it is good food I am glad to eat.
  The service was incredibly fast. Tonight, a Friday evening, they were packed, yet we ordered, ate and chatted, and were out the door in less than 40 minutes. Staffers were there whenever my glass was low, but weren't in our faces all the time.
  The prices are medium - you're looking at $10-20 per person depending on what you order.
   The restaurant itself is pretty decent. The decor is pretty American Mexi-style, with obligatory bright colors and wood furniture. It's not a quiet place, but it isn't real loud - just active.
  Short story is, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but am perfectly happy to stop in.
