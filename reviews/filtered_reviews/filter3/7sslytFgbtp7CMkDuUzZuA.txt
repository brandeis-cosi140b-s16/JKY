Stopped by here last night for dinner. The guava margarita did not disappoint as it was as delicious as how I remembered it from my first visit. We ordered the shrimp ceviche de camaron and the enchilada de pollo. The ceviche came in a tiny portion with a few plaintain chips on the side. For $11, it was as unimpressive as a ceviche can be. Do not get this item if you come here unless you want to be disappointed. 

Max said the enchilada was the best he had ever had but he said that about everything so, caveat emptor.

It is best to come here for happy hours and chug a few margaritas down with friends.
