We stopped in here for a late afternoon snack while shopping in old town Scottsdale.  We arrived about 2:00pm and our party of 4 was one of only 4 occupied tables.  In spite of this fact we had to hunt for the hostess to be seated.  Once seated at a table we were greeted by the waitress who made it clear through her demeanor that it was us who would be doing the waiting.  

The food did redeem an otherwise poor experience.  We ordered the guacamole and the fajita nachos.  The guacamole was cool and refreshing with just a hint of jalapeno and was served with crispy warm corn chips.  The nachos were served in a sizzling iron skillet and were piled high with white cheese, black beans, onions and jalapenos, But what really set them apart were the fire roasted poblano peppers.  

All in all, good food, so-so service.
