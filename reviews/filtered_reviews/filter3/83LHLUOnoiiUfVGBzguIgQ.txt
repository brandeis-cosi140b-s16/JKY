I'm kind of torn on Round Corner Cantina. Their food is definitely not bad but I feel there's better taco choices in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh actually has a lot of good taco joints & I wouldn't rate Round Corner one of my favorite. 
The chips & salsa is so so. The chips seem to be made in house so that is a plus. 
I absolutely love the Elotes, which is sweet corn with Queso fresco on top. I would give the corn 5 stars. I haven't found any other restaurant that makes the sweet corn as good. 
For the tacos I've ordered the mahi mahi & the potato cauliflower. The mahi mahi is good. But not a fan of the cauliflower. I thought it was kind of dry & lacked some flavor. 
Also the set up is kinda of strange. There's no hostess when you walk in so you seat yourself, the seating area is kind of small & it can be hard to get a table. And on nights when they are busy it can get tricky to figure out who's waiting for a table & who's been in line the longest without there being a hostess to keep track. Service is so so. 
Round Corner is worth trying and I recommend going on a week night when its not so busy.
