I love the tortillas here, and as everyone else has said, it's very quick, but I was disappointed with the machacha and egg burrito which had very little taste.  Also, the salsa just didn't do much for me.  The enchilada and taco combo I ordered a different time was only ok.  I like the refried beans.  Overall, it's good but not great Mexican food.
