The first time I went here, the tortas were great.  On subsequent visits, I wasn't as impressed with the quality, and prices went up a bit.  Coincidentally, they started getting a lot of press for being one of the best sandwich places in the Valley.

The cynic in me makes it hard not to think that they are coasting a bit on their rep with the gringo crowd.  This place isn't consistently fast or consistently good - and on multiple occasions, they've even been out of key ingredients early in the day.

Still, the tortas are good, and they aren't so much over-priced as other torta places are under-priced.  Decent value, decent quality, 3 stars.
