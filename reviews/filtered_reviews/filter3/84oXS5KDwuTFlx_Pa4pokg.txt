I only tried this place because it was featured on The Real World... lol... so when my friends and I didn't know where to eat, I suggested we come here.

WARNING: Pink Taco is NOT authentic Mexican food. So if that's what you are looking for, you will leave feeling disappointed. I mean, they don't even have Horchata or anything. What Mexican restaurant doesn't have Horchata? haha

I ordered two carne asada tacos & one fish taco. The carne asada tacos were good, but I've had MUCH MUCH better fish tacos at other places. The rice was a little hard for my taste, but the beans were pretty good. The Lemonade kinda sucked.

The service wasn't great but it wasn't bad. 

Overall, I thought it was okay. I don't mind trying different versions of Mexican food. I wouldn't really MIND coming back here.
