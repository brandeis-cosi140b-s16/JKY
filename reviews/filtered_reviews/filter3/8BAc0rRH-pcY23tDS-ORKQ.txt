Seat yourself restaurant. They probably just had a rush of customers. When I was trying to find a seat. Most tables was taken up with dirty dishes. The staff wasn't particularly friendly but took my order quick and I was served fairly quickly. I ordered the taco salad w/chicken and a shock top beer, the salad is pretty decent and beer though, I got a price 'shock' when I got the bill. My draft beer was $9.75 while my salad was $12.49. Should've asked the price of beer before I ordered it.
