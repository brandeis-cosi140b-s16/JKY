This locally own restaurant has been a part of Arizona for as long as my parents can remember. 

Our own George W Bush visited this establishment on his stop in Arizona (The booth is immortalized by a plaque and newspaper clippings) 

I want so badly to love this place. The decor is adorably kitschy, and full of historical mementos .  The booths are small and cramped, but they made restaurants smaller in those days. 

The wait staff is always running, always efficient and very friendly. Even on the busiest of nights. 

The food is fair. Nothing spectacular. Chips are usually stale, but they're free. My last visit I had a cheese and onion enchilada and a taco. The shredded beef was very wet and greasy but the flavor was okay. 

All in all, I will continue to visit, because I love the vibe. Also their margaritas are good and strong. Maybe I will do better with a burrito?
