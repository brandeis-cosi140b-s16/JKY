My husband loves their food, but it is just okay to me. The inside doesn't look clean enough for me and they have long wait times. I still have no clue on their order system. But I am giving them 3 stars because their Jade chicken keeps my husband happy. We are from Chicago and haven't really found any food to die for yet, like back home.
