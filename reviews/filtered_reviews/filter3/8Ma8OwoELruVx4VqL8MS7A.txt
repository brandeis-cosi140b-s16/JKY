A little joint who had a country singer from Branson, Mo. singing away in there at the time.  The burgers are pretty darn tasty and not too pricey but they need to check themselves with the service.

One time I went in there for some drinks cause I was melting from the heat and it took some time to not only get the drinks but to get them to come back and take the money so I could go!  Another time hubs went in there to get some to go burgers for us and again - service was totally discombobulated about taking, getting, giving the orders and change! 

Fix those elements and ya might just get more stars.
