We were in the mood for some Mexican food and stumbled across this joint.  It's a casual dining place with 15 or so tables and a small bar.  Complimentary Chips & Salsa are included with your meal.  They give you 2 types of Salsa.....Mild and Spicy.

The Spicy Salsa is very good.....the Chips are very thin and break easily....so they got 1/2 of that right.

Side of Sour Cream - $1.35
2 Glasses of House Cabernet - $6.75

The Cheese Crisp was very good.  It's like an open faced Quesadilla with the Tortilla cooked nice and crispy.

The Cheese Enchilada was OK....kind of salty.

The Better Half enjoyed her Carnitas Burrito, but she said it wasn't anything special.  She only ate 1/2 of it....took the other 1/2 home.  The glasses of Wine was hers also....and thought it was ok, what could you expect from house Wine?

Overall, it was an OK dinner....did not 'wow' us.
