The service was amazing here. Our waitress was so attentive and actually had a personality.  (The Tequila Goddess, on the other hand, was kind of scary - I have no idea what that child was wearing).

So we ordered muddled margaritas - I guess a mix between blended and margarita on the rocks.  The fruit (raspberry, strawberry, blackberry, etc) is smashed and added to a margarita on the rocks.  For the blackberry one, it resulted in a smushy string of clumpy blackberries about the size of a golf ball at the bottom of the drink. It tasted so good, but the clump really prevented any drinking from going on.  By the time I moved on to the strawberry muddled margarita either the clumps were gone, or I was too drunk to care.

For food, we ordered the Queso Fundido. I had no idea what it was but my simple translation of "Fun Cheese" made it sound very appealing.  It made for a very oily/greasy cheese mess with flour tortillas. I'm not complaining, I'm just saying...

Dinner was the Filet Mignon burrito shared with my friends cheese enchiladas.  Both were good, the enchiladas were tiny sad little guys but still tasty.  

Chips and salsa were very tasty and served warm.

I wouldn't go back - not because of the food or experience, but because there are just too many great places in Vegas to eat.
