Food was good but the service...meh. Considering the location (across the street from Eddie Matney's) they really need to step it up.

I don't think I need to describe the food as it was all the standard fare you'd get at every other Mexican restaurant in town so I won't detail it. It was flavorful and was served hot though so that's a plus.

The service..well, it was just kind of indifferent. Our server didn't greet us, didn't seem interested in serving us, and was about as indifferent as someone can be who is working in the service industry and earns tips. I was rather surprised given that this is Scottsdale and you really do need to work a little to earn a tip. 

I'll go back because the food was good enough for a second visit so I hope that our visit was a fluke on the service side of things.
