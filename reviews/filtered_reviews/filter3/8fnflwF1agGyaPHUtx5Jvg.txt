I did enjoy this place. The chips and salsa were good and the wait staff was nice. This place gets super loud and I don't know why, it was kinda frustrating. I got the chimichanga, it was good and the beans and rice were fantastic but the chimi was super greasy. It even formed a noticable pool of grease on my place. That was kinda sick but its still tasted good. Blue Adobe is a bit pricey for what it is but I would go back there again.
