The decor of this place is fantastic!  The staff is also very nice.  I really enjoyed their Sweet Tea drink (with bourbon).  The food is good, but unfortunately I don't care for cilantro.  I will eat around it but when I asked them not to top my enchiladas with it, the waitress said this could not be done. I don't think it is very difficult to 'hold' the cilantro especially when you can tell it's the last think the chef adds as a garnish.
