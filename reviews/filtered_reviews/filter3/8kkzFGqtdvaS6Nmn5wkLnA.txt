Dinner here last night. Got a table near the windows - fabulous nighttime view. We had shrimp and beef fajitas, beef tacos and chicken enchiladas. The beef in my fajitas seemed to need a little more grilled flavor, as they seemed a bit tasteless. Quantities were good though. Loved the tortillas that came with my dish though - they were big, not the usual small ones. You only get 2 though, but since they're burrito-sized, that is ok. By the way, the free chips come with a nice salsa and bean dip - both were quite tasty. Seems like a fun place for a party or drinks - quite loud, and people seemed to be having a good time.
