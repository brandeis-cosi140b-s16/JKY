Nothing worse then a server who has attitude when you ask a question. Surprisingly ok - good overall grub,
We ordered chicken and steak tacos asked if they could hard shell it.. The made the shell fresh to order. Queso fundido was ok. Everything was real greasy which is good and bad at the same time if you know what I mean??!!! 

Overall ok id never go back.
