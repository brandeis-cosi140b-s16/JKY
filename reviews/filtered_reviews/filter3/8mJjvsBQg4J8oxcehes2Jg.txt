So me and my Bestfriend  went here for drinks and Mexican Food. We get there the lady informs us that the front bar is closed and to go to the back. It was loud and we walked in and saw the second bar was packed and seats where taken. I walk up to the back and she inform us it was a 20-30 min wait. We found the back bar sat down and  order drinks and food.  I order tacos and chips and salsa  my best friend order steak. It took 30mins for are food to come out  but are waiter Chris and the other young lady which I didn't get her name were  sweet. We could here the music and have fun. Food was ok big pieces of chicken and I thought the chips and salsa would come out first not with the food.
