Another late dinner, this time we were craving Mexican food, so we came to Ricardo's on a recommendation.  I ordered the Enchiladas de Verduras, when my food arrived, I was surprised to see my enchiladas smothered in Cheez Whiz...Yuck.

I asked the waitress if she could get me a new plate with regular enchilada sauce and melted cheese, she was happy to oblige.  Overall, the food was not bad, but nothing to write home about.

The waitress was wearing this odd country style flouncy mini dress complete with petticoat and her hair styled in 2 side buns...Only in Vegas...?
