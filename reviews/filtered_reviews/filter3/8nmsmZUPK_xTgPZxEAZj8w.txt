Great looking place, but way over priced. They even charge you for chips and salsa. The food was OK, nothing to write home about. I guess I should have expected this for Las Vegas tourist trap restaurant. Although the taste of the food was mediocre  the service was good. The food came out very approximately 3 minutes after we ordered it. So quickly in fact I guessing the plates where pre-made and then microwaved, but I can't confirm that. Diablo cantina was a total bust. They will never get another dine from me.
