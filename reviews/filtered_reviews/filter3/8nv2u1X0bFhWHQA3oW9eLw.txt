Had a chicharron taco, Shrimp taco, and a breakfast burrito. Didn't really taste the chicharron. More sauce than anything. The fish taco was good. Breakfast burrito had rice beans n chorizo in it. I like my breakfast burritos with just egg, meat n potatoes. First time I've had retried beans in my breakfast burrito, wasn't a fan. The chorizo was tasty, egg was minimal. Thought the food i ordered was "OK" at best. I'd rather eat at pepe's tacos.
