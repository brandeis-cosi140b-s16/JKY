Azteca has been a favorite of mine since way before Yelp, so I am disappointed that my first visit since that time was my least favorite.
I met my two best friends for what has become an annual before Christmas craziness dinner. 

 Azteca does have the best pico de gallo of any other place and our queso was delicious as well. My friends enjoyed to very delicious margaritas while I drank a cold Negro Medelo.

 Dinner is where I found my self a bit disappointed.  We all ordered combination plates, mine was the taco with ground beef.  Our service was slow for the night and my plate arrived warm with one side of my corn tortilla taco completely soggy.  

We had a very long wait for our checks which were split incorrectly and there was further confusion about how my one friend's visa was charged.  The waiter was was very appologetic and the situarion was resolved, but very awkward.

I am a great fan of Azteca, and I chalk this visit up to an off night.
