I am tainted by the plethora of Mexican restaurants in San Diego. To me this is an average to slightly below average place to grab some Mexican food. The fajitas I ordered were dry and dosed in copious amounts of salt. The tortilla tasted like the kind that come from the grocery store. They were bland. This is an instant removal of one star for any Mexican restaurant. Any decent Mexican restaurant makes their tortilla from scratch. It's really not difficult and it does not take a lot of time. My wife had the enchiladas which were just as forgettable. El Segundo gets two and half stars so I am rounding up to three. The margaritas and the service were the best of this restaurant. I won't be coming back unless it's for drinks.
