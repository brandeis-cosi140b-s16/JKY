This local chain is certainly in decline, but still offers some very unique New Mexico flavors. Their many restaurants differ widely in cleanliness and service. This location in Awatukee was above average in cleanliness and the service was top notch. Our waiter handled our dietary needs and desire to get in and out very fast.

You almost can't lose with the New Mexico-style dishes (many of which are very spicy), but stay away from the "Guacamole Dip" appetizer. In an effort to make the dish seem bigger they pile it on top of a bed of cabbage, and toss it with tons of coarse chopped fresh tomatoes as filler. Much of the guacamole is lost in the process, and what is left is flavorless anyway.

Highly recommend the Banderra Enchiladas.
