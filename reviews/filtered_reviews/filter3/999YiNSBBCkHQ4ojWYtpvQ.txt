NOTE:  I want to apologize now for strange nature of the following review.  I spent close to 12 hours in a meeting today and my train of thought has been slipping on and off the rails.

In the interest of full disclosure, I must admit that my review may be somewhat tainted.  I dined at T&T approximately 10 days after I had been on a taco bender with my brother, in a south Texas border town where the primary language is Spanish.  Mexican food served elsewhere in the US (including Las Vegas) has been less then satisfying in comparison.

Having said that, I am giving T&T a solid 3 star because the food was A-OK.  Not earth shattering, but definitely a step above Don Pablo's, Taco Bell, Chi-Chi's et.al.

The tortilla chips were warm and nicely coated with sea salt.  The salsas served with the chips were ok but a little bland for my taste, though this was remedied with the addition of the habanero based hot sauce on the table. 

For my entree, I ordered a combo consisting of a chicken tamal, a beef enchilada, and a taco al pastor (they referred to it as a "shaved taco" which, having the juvenile sense of humor that I do, I found quite amusing).

The tamal was seasoned nicely and the chicken quite tender.  The enchilada was tasty and surprisingly filling despite it's somewhat diminutive size.  The only negative in my entree was the shaved taco (huh-huh, huh-huh... cool!).  While the addition of pineapple made for a very juicy taco, it also made it too sweet.  I prefer my tacos with the bite of a little acid from fresh lime juice.

I'd certainly hit this place again if I were staying at the Luxor.  I'll just order the fish taco next time.
