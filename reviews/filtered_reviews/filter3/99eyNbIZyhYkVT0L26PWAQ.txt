I went here two weeks ago while in vegas with my boyfriend.  I LOVE that this place is open 24hrs. Who doesn't love 24hr Mexican food. The chips and salsa are amazing.  They even give you refried beans with your sauces.  Margaritas are strong and a reasonable price.  Food was pretty good as well. Only con was the service. They weren't very attentive at times.  Over all great place.  With good food and don't forget it's open 24hrs!!
