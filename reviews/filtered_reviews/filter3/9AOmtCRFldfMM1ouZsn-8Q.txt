After seeing the other reviews for this place, I was nervous.  But it looked like they had decent frozen margaritas, so we gave it a shot. 

Service was fast, friendly (despite our pickiness about what options were vegetarian), and our waitress checked back very regularly, even though it was pretty obvious we weren't ordering more drinks. 

Atmosphere was pretty good.  Lots of families with kids, but at least no annoying birthday songs every 10 mins.  Place seems clean, and our booth was pretty comfy.

We only ordered one margarita each, and they're freakin huge! My house margarita was ok, the wife was less impressed with her frozen strawberry version.

As for the food... Meh.  They brought us chips to start.  The salsa and dip were good, but the chips were all either really stale, or really undercooked, and completely unseasoned.  I then had their regular chimmy, and the wife had a burrito.  Both of those were pretty good.

Bottom line, I think the place is worth a try.  I'm just not chomping at the bit to go back.
