VERY MEDIOCRE. 

I suppose when I am in Vegas the first decision for Mexican fare should not be attached to a mall, so silly me for that decision. 

The salsa's were meh, the guacamole was meh, the fajitas were meh. The one PLUS they has was the delicious two-tone margarita (aka frozen margarita with sangria on top). I could have had 3 of those drinks and skipped eating and been okay.

We were sat at a table right near where all the serves grabbed glasses and plates, so needless to say it was very loud and a lot of clanking all night. 

I wouldn't recommend this but the server was nice and the drinks were good, so I gave it 3 stars.
