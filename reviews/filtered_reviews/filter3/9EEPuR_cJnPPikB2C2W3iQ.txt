Three and a half stars. Decent Mexican food. I could tell because there was some still on my menu!

Full bar. One decent margarita. One type of Chardonnay for my wife. Nothing special about the place at all, just basic good food. Service was nice and efficient. Plenty of seating and they were busy tonight. (Thursday)
