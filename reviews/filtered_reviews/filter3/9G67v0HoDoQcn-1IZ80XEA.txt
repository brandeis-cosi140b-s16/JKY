Only REAL reason we went there cuz my wife found a $5 coupon. So, we went. I did not have any big expectations and therefore was not disappointed. 

This joint is exactly what you would expect from this kind of chain places - Large, busy, kid infested, loud, etc We got this little girl waitress who had other little girl in tow for training. They did OK, if not were very prompt to remove dirty dishes from the table. 

Food was alright. Nothing to write home about. You basic run of the mill chain grade Mexican food. Maybe, a bit on the tastier side of the scale, to be honest. 

My Corona was good as was my wife's Rita. 

All in all, one CAN go there but should one? With abundance of good Mexican eateries around there seems to be no real reason to go to a chain one.
