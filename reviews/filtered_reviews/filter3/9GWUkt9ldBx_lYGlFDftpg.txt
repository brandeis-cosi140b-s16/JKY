They were pushing the margaritas... we ordered one house margarita and one of the higher quality tequila margaritas and told the waiter not to tell us which one was which. We disagreed on which was the better one (so really the house margaritas here are delicious... and there's only a 2 dollar difference). Fresh tortilla chips, bean dip and salsa are complimentary and the baskets/bowls never get close to empty before being promptly replaced. We ordered fresh guacamole which was made at our table to our liking. We also ordered the carnitas with the coca-cola sauce on the side. The sauce was very sweet so I'm glad we had the choice of how much to put onto our food but it was delicious. Overall I left feeling satisfied and almost stuffed (I definitely take advantage of the chip refills). One of the better Mexican restaurants in town but a little pricey.

On a side note: I have also heard great things about Lindos on Flamingo and Hualipi just west of the 215.
