Been meaning to come here, because who isn't curious about the fusion of chinese food with mexican wrapped in a burrito or melted in a quesadilla? Well, it was interesting to eat for sure. The service is pretty good, very friendly, and if it's your first time, which is was for us, they give a sample of part of their menu (beans, red jade chicken, chicken with ginger, chicken fried rice, shredded pork, and jerk chicken was thrown in since we were curious)

I got the egg foo young with no meat in a burrito and added regular fried rice to mine. It was pretty small, definitely not a chipotle sized serving of a burrito and slightly greasy (oil dripping out the tortilla when I took a bite greasy), but it was tasty. My friend got the chile relleno with the side of beans and the quesadilla with the gringo chicken, which she thought was ok. I think we kind of enjoyed our samples more. 

It surprisingly had a lot of seating inside and the decor is also a fusion of mexican and chinese culture with chili peppers dangling from the wall and tsing tao ads/chinese new year lanterns hanging from the ceiling. I would probably come back to try the meat dishes since the red jade chicken was a spiced up version of sweet and sour chicken and the jerk chicken fried rice was good. I think I might have gotten a stomach ache from it though.
