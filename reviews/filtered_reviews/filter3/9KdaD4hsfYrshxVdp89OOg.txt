After eating here, I am still looking for the authentic street tacos that I've had several times on the streets of Ensenada Mexico.  

The customer service there was great but I could easily tell that this was catered for more of the American taste buds as they didn't have tripa, lengua, or cabeza!  I had the Asada, which was kinda dry, bland and lacked the crunchy outside and juicy inside of a steak cooked over a hot grill.  The toppings for the tacos were also average at best. However, I will give props to the tortillas as they were pretty much as good as it gets.  Perhaps my expectations were too high so it's possibly worth a try to decide for yourself but for me, I don't see myself eating there again any time soon
