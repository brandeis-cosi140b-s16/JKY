Good food and the place can be happening.  But to be perfectly honest, there's much better Mexican food to be found in greater Phoenix at a cheaper price point.

There's nothing bad about GB, and they do many things well, but I'm not sure if they'd get mentioned in the top 10 for many Mexican dishes.  In other words, I'd be happy to meet travelers staying at the hotel, but if someone wanted great Tacos, etc. - I'd suggest elsewhere.
