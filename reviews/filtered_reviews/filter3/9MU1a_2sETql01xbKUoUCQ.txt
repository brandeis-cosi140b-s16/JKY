I remember coming here few months ago and was blown away by all the amazing tacos. I don't know if I came here on their off day or they went downhill but I was disappointed by my visit today.

SERVICE
Meh. Its one of those people that hates their job so they turn into a robot and don't give two shits about customers. Waited 15 min at the table for our order and lady threw the bag on the table and walked off. No thanks.

FOOD
On my previous visit, I ordered the mini Carne Asada taco and really liked it. I believe their mini tacos comes with cilantro, meat of choice and onions. They are only  $1.99 so it would be great for people who like to experiment with different add-ons and choice of meat. Carne Asada was so juicy few months ago. Now, its just a dry piece of meat. Asked for extra avocado but I barely got any which is somewhat irritating.

Fish taco was another one of my favorite from last visit. It used to have so much flavor. Now, lacks flavor and shredded fish that falls apart as crumbs everywhere. No thanks.

CONCLUSION
Please step up your game. You guys used to have some delicious tacos..I want them back!
