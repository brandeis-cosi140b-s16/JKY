I came to Arizona to visit my family, it was my first time here and first time out and about. So we stopped in here to get some lunch and watch NCAA Basketball finals. The drinks were good. Service was friendly. Didnt really care for the chips and salsa though. I forgot what dish I had but its a local favorite (it says that on the menu) But its a flour tortilla with your choice of meat (I had Chicken, would have been better with shredded chicken) and cream cheese and deep fried. Not healthy by any means but so delicious.
