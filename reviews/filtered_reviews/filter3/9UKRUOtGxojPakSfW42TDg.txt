Oh Mi Patio! I do have to say that this place is really hit or miss.  I cannot really give it anything about a 3 because I have been to places that have better food and just an all around better feel.  Mi Patio isnt bad by all means but it is just ok!

I had the tamale plate, which came with a red chile tamale, rice and beans.  The beans were great!  The rice was little to be desired, very hard and had no real flavor to it.  The tamale wasnt bad.  The flavor was good but the bulk of it as masa.  I like a tamale with a lot of meat inside and the tamale was about 5% meat and 95% masa!

The guest I took liked their plates so all in all it was a good experience.  I received a lot more recommendation for mexican food that I am going to try!  As of now I am on a mission to find an authentic, good mexican restaurant in Phoenix...Yelp does it exist?
