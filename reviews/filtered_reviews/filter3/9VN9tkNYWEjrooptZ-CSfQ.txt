I really wanted to love this place but alas, I didn't. the salsas were good and spicy. chips were eh, alright. I had the carnitas...tons of fat. I get it, pork is a fatty meat and it gives more flavor, but I think for 14.95, they could certainly have cleaned it up a bit. My beans had fat pieces in it too. Chewy and nasty when you don't expect it. My friend had the garlic pork. Flavorless and a small portion. My other friend had the Carne Adovada chimi. Christmas style. It was actually pretty good. Spicy red and green sauce, lots of heat. We had the chorizo dip. It was chorizo and a dollop of sour cream with 4 overcooked pita chips. So, here's the clincher. They give you a plate of meat that in the menu says..."served with tortillaS ". Nope, you get 1. Just 1. It's 1.50 for an extra tortilla. Not a side, A tortilla. F' ing ridiculous. When we asked our server for another and he told us that it's extra, he followed it up by saying that they're homemade and hard to make so that's why they're extra. I won't go back for this very reason but then the manager came by and asked how everything was so we told him and he just nodded like he couldn't understand what we were saying. Right then, he could have saved us as customers. I believe in giving 2nd chances and I would've just tried the tacos but that manager just looked at us like he couldn't believe we wanted another 5inch tortilla. The service was decent enough but I wish servers would tell their names but it's not a deal breaker if they don't. Also, there's an extra charge for more chips and extra charge for more salsa. They overcharge for what they serve anyways so added charges for that stuff is ridiculous! So....ADIOS Los Dos, I will not be back.
