Alright, so the Jerk chicken sounds good, but it's bland.
The white rice isn't cooked right, so it's going to be worth it to spend the extra seventy-five cents to get fried rice.

The black beans are DAMN GOOD. I don't like beans in general, but these black beans have a super delicious flavor and I could eat them all day.

If I liked orange chicken I would like the Jade chicken because the flavor is nice, but I just don't like that fried texture.

Mmmmmm Mmmmmmm GOOD.

OH and if it is your first time there, let them know and they will give you samples and explain how to order, etc.
