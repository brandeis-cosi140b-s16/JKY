So I had the food again recently and their steak is so much better. The food I would give five stars It was so flavorful and moist. What I am giving3 stars about is the misguided oricing. I thought was interesting that I went with a few friends for lunch, and they didn't give us a inch menu but I did not think anything of it. So I order an enchilada and tacos cambo. And it was $8.49 or $8.99. Keep in mind that I went around qw:30 so it was lunch time.  Didn't think anything of it, but now ai looked on their website and that should have been priced at $6.45. And then when my coworker placed an order for tacos.  Oh yes keep in mind that they only have refills on water and tea. All their sodas are given in a bottle or a can.and no free refills on that.
