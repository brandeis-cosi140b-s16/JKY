This was our first place to go for food when we arrived in Vegas on Saturday night. It came as a recommendation from a coworker and we figured we'd check it out.

The Mexican food itself is decent and the prices are reasonable given how fancy the place looks. We ordered tacos and enchiladas, which came with sides of beans and rice. We weren't disappointed in our food at all but I guess we were hoping for something that would blow us away. Or maybe we're just spoiled by awesome quality Mexican food we can get back home?

The winners of the evening though were the margaritas. My partner ordered a classic and I picked out the watermelon. I was actually shocked that my drink came out refreshing and smooth tasting! I was expecting an overly sweet, super intense watermelon "juice" flavour that I've experienced in mixed drinks before, but this was very light and smooth and everything I've ever wanted in a drink that involves this fruit.

My suggestion would be to come here for some drinks and maybe a snack or appetizer. Or have many drinks. The tequila menu is kind of mind-blowing.
