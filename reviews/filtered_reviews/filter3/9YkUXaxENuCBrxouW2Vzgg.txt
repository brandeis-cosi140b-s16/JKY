I was super excited to try China Poblano's innovative tacos because 1) I love Mexican food and 2) (don't get grossed out) I LOVE duck tongue.

My mom used to make duck tongue allll the time when I was growing up, and I have no idea how to cook it, so I crave it all the time.

The duck tongue and lychee taco was definitely a let down. For over $5, the tiny taco was TINY, and nothing special. The sweet lychee did not go well with the tongue... and the taco was soggy and disappointing ):

Boo. Guess I have to find a better duck tongue taco somewhere else!!
