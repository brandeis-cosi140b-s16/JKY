Lengua (cow tongue) tacos were so soft and delicious, but I would skip the adobada (spicy pork) because the meat was so tough. 

It's really interesting inside the place because they have separate lines for everything. I guess it makes sense since they're so popular! But that means that you have to stand in line multiple times if you want different types of tacos/fries. The asada (beef steak) line was the longest (went straight out the door and started going against the side of the building) and the adobada was the shortest. Almost no line for the cashier, though! It does get really crowded in there and there are no designated exit doors, so be careful not to drop the food you waited ~15 minutes for!
