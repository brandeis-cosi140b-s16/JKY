I stumbled onto this restaurant last St. Paddy's day while in Chicago. I was in love! The decor was awesome, the food great, but the margaritas was what won my heart. Housemade margie mix, and no fake stuff.  I love the tableside guac and the chips and salsa are deeee-lish. One of my favorite meals is chips & salsa and margaritas. Be careful, two drinks and you're making new friends. Sit at the bar and talk to Jennifer. She's the best!

I want to come and try brunch!
