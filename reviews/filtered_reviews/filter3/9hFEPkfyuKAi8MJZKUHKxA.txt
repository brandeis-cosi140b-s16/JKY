I have always liked this place. However, their prices are getting ridiculous for Mexican food. They charge more than $4.00 for one tamale. Really? My grandmother made hers from scratch and I know the ingredients don't cost that much. I would rather support that entrepreneur who shows up in his white unmarked van in the parking lot of Wal-Mart. He sells his for $1.00, and they are tasty. OK - so I am a little trusting. 

I usually opt for the Chile Verde burrito (a la cart) because I refuse to spend the 15-20 dollars they ask for -on most of their entrees. The burrito is simple -Chile Verde, onions and beans.  Don't get me wrong, the burrito is good - but not $10.00 good.

The reason I keep coming back is that I like the old school vibe it has inside (at least at this location). Plus, the chips and salsa are fantastic. 

There are half dozen Mexican restaurants in the area that I enjoy better than this place. If they keep raising their prices, they may drop off my radar altogether. 

Hmmm, it's about time I go visit my tamale guy.
