This place used to be so much better. I would come in from DC and my whole family would go here and get copious amounts of tacos. They are decent but with so much competition you need to stand out to survive. 

The beef tacos were ok but lacked serious flavor. The breakfast burrito was uninspired and was kind of soggy. The green chile salsa was very bland as well. 

The portions are large and the normal salsa is quite tasty but overall there is better Mex to be had.
