I'm giving this a 3 star only because of the price and quality of the food. To their credit, the place is clean, appears to run pretty efficiently, and the staff is polite and prompt. But $13 for that little margarita? I dunno. I ordered the Nachos as an "appetizer but could I have it as a meal, please? yes, with chicken" but I had to dig around for the little pieces of chicken it came with. Fortunately, I'm not much of a meat eater so it made little difference to me. But, for $17, when I want chicken, I want more that 2 oz. scattered in little pieces throughout. 

The sidebar guac looked entertaining although we did not partake. There's also televisions so you can watch the latest game before catching your flight. However, the way overpriced food and lack of substance is what brought this review down.
