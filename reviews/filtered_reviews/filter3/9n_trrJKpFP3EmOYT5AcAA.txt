Wow this place was packed for a Thursday night. With a half an hour wait I was expecting great things. Everything was just average. The chips were greasy and the salsa wasn't anything to write home about. The pricing is very reasonable. The Carne Asada was thick but very chewy, not the best piece of meat. The frozen margarita was very good and I had a bite of someone's tamale and tostada and those were both very good. The ambiance is more of what people go for I think. The interior is very cozy and welcoming like someone's home.
