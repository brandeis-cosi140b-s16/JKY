Do they have some of the best Mexican food in town? Yes, they do. At least from our sample of eating there about five or six times.

Why the lowly three stars then? They had a busy night and, as we wanted to sit on the patio, we had to wait for about forty minutes. That is ok as it was our choice. What was not our choice was waiting for another twenty minutes without anybody taking our order. All the while people at other tables, seated after us, had their order taken and their food served. We eventually gave up and went inside to pay for the beer we had while waiting to be seated. They didn't want to take our money and were apologetic, but it's little consolation when you're angry from hunger. We left without eating.

We will likely try it again on a less busy night. There aren't that many places in town which have creamy chipotle salsa.
