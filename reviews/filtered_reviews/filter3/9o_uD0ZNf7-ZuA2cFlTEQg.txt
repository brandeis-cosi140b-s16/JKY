Just discovered this little gem.  I liked it.  The salsa is not nearly as good as the red sauce that has hits of garlic.  Had the three way burro enchilada style.  My lunch partner had a chicken burro also enchilada style.  The portions are huge for the price.  Can I say it is the most mind-blowing burro?  Likely not.  I will say however, that the horchata is delicious, the service good and nothing is super spicy.  Sometimes I want spice, some other times, I really want the other flavors to be complemented by a little kick.  This is a good alternative for times when you don't want to brave the wait at Tortas del Rey, or you have out of town guests who can't handle the heat.
