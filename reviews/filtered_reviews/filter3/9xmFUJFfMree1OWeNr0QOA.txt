I feel like a racist when I eat here.  Maybe it's the panda bear dressed as Pancho Villa.  Maybe it's the REST of the name (Chino Bandido Takee-Outee).  Maybe it's the fact that I giggled when I saw both.  I don't know.  I just feel bad about it.

That said, the food is actually pretty good.  It certainly won't blow your mind, but getting a Chinese chicken dish with Spanish rice is an experience to savor.  The snickerdoodle is cool, too.  One big drawback?  An incomparably confusing ordering system that leaves even Mensa minds with a headache.  

For better or worse, this is a restaurant that has never heard the word, "no."
