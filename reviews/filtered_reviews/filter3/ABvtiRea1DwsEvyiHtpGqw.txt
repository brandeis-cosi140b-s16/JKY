Omg, It was Last Thursday April 16,2009. The Hostess behind the booth got the Biggest BOOB JOB of all. My wife was next to me and she also saw her too. Lucky she wasnt mad about that. HAHAHA!!!!! Thats a reason why there was alot of guys there than ladies. 

The price is fair comparing to other hotels that charge more. Average price range about $15 including drinks. Food is ok but the guacamole is the only thing that taste good.
