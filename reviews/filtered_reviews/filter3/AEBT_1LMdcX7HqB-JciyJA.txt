My parents like this place so we eat here fairly often.  The salsa is pretty good and the food is reasonable for americanized mexican.  Nothing is particularly spicy or flavorful and they may serve the worst fish tacos I've ever had.  If you stick to burros and fried ice cream you can have a nice family dinner here.
