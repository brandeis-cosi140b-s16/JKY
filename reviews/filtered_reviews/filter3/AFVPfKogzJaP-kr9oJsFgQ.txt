Here are my thoughts about Juan Jaime's:
- I can't believe they charge for chips and salsa. This is not Taco Bell, it's a sit down restaurant.
- I asked for more salsa and the server said to me "Oh, it's right over there at the salsa bar." Apparently I have to get my food myself. Not the best customer service.
- The menu is limited. That being said, I did enjoy by pork burrito, which was recommended by my server.
- The happy hour specials are pretty good. I enjoyed my strawberry margarita made with a top shelf tequila.

I really want to love Juan Jaime's because the food options directly around Chandler Mall are limited to mostly family chain restaurants. Not sure we will be back.
