Steel Cactus sits in a great location on Walnut Street in Shadyside. You have to walk up a few flights of steps once you get there but this place has some cool decor and two floors of seating. The top floor is the roof and my friend and I decided that a second flight up was worth it to enjoy a perfect day. 

This trip to Steel Cactus was purely in the name of happy hour. Too bad we were there a little early for happy hour (starts at 5PM) so we couldn't get the reduced price.  No worries, that wouldn't stop me from ordering Pumking on tap!

We decided to share an order of chicken nachos to offset the high ABV content of said Pumking and I'd rate the nachos a 2.5 out of 5. Definitely not the best ever. 

I don't often mention restrooms in my reviews but I must say the bathroom at Steel Cactus was sparkling clean. Like, you could eat your nachos off the floor clean. Also, good friendly service to be found here. 

Good happy hour destination and if the weather is nice I highly recommend heading up to the roof.
