Came here for a quick meal before a night of partying it up =D

Overall enjoyed the food.  Service started out great but ended after we got our food.  No one checked in one us for the last half hour of our meal, and had to flag down someone to ask for our check.  

The food was pretty expensive for a 'la salsa' restaurant, but that may have been because we were in Vegas (prime location - inside the Miracle Mile Shoppes).  We paid approximately $90 including tip for 2 entrees, and 2 drinks which is pretty unreasonable for a fast food chain restaurant.

Other than the price, and the long wait for our check...everything else was satisfactory.
