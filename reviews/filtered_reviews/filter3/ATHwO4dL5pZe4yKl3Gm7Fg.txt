We came for my friend's free birthday entree.  She had a printed coupon from the internet.  We sat in the Cantina so my other friend and I could order from the Happy Hour menu.

We ordered my favorite Original Fajita Nachos and tried the Crispy Chicken Flauta Rolls.  My friend really liked the Crispy Flauta Rolls.  They were crisp and flaky served with a jalape√±o jelly.  I just wish we had asked for the appetizers to come about 10-15 minutes apart.

My friend wore the traditional birthday sombrero and had "Happy Birthday" sung to her by the staff and got a complimentary scoop of vanilla ice cream in a fried cinnamon tortilla bowl.

We will be back if we are in the area.
