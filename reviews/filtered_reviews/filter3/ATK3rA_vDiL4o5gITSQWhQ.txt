I purchased a Groupon to try this restaurant out.  The place was OK.

The best part was the free chips and salsa that comes in the beginning of the experience when you're the most hungry.  The chips were fresh and came with three different salsas: green, red, and pico de gallo.  Yummy!

I ordered the beef enchiladas, my friends ordered the chicken burrito and chicken enchiladas.  All were satisfied with their food, but both commented that we can easily have gotten the same quality at an outside Mexican restaurant such as El Torito or even Chili's.  For being in a casino, I would have thought the quality would be better.  

The service was great as our waiter was extremely courteous.  The food was OK, but nothing much to rave about.  But if you're staying at this hotel and need a Mexican fix, this will do the job because the prices aren't too bad!
