Not sure what everyone else was eating, but for me it was just okay. The meat had a great flavor/taste but a slight tough and fatty at times. The salsa bar seemed to be flavorless and cut down with water or something. Every great taco must be accompanied by a great salsa/chili.
 If your in the area I would give it a shot.
