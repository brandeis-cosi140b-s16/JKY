I have been coming here for years and the few things that have yet to change is the decor, seating, and spiked margaritas. Sadly when I visited this last time, I noticed their tortillas had shrank, the red sauce is darker, and the chicken don't really taste like chicken. I still love their side dinner salads though. And hands down some of the most flavorful and strongest margaritas in town. Which I love. The service is great and the atmosphere is relaxing with old mariachis playing in the background. Definitely a good spot for family gatherings :)
