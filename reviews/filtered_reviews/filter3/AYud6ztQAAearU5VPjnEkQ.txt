After eating at Red Mango it's new neighbor, went down here for dinner. Yes try it....dessert first then dinner. It kinda flows. This place has good gringo mexican food. Not real mexican. But eh. gringo style. They have fish tacos. I think they make it with whiting...Eh a little fishy for me and it's not a huge hefty chunk of fish. The Paradise roll was pretty good. Good enough for me to burn the roof of my mouth. The Mexicalzi salad was great. But I was looking for a peanut sauce? The rice bowl - was the second thing I enjoyed. I dunno I liked the place but I didn't. I mean the food wasn't phenomenal. The decor.....looked like there was a beach caricature convention in town and they all decided to migrate here with some taggers and decorate, but in the meantime there was a quinceniera and a pinata party caught up in the middle of it and a bomb exploded....Yea so that's the best description I can have. Drink menu not too interested. They use cheap margaritaville tequila in everything. But you can substitute. Rosaritopolitan. Hmm Cosmo w tequila? Banana cream pie margarita.....Banana cream pie shot - with tequila? I mean it just wasn't creative or original. Here's a freebie. Spicy Tapatio and Mint Margarita....Hey that's my own concoction. Don't knock it till you try it. Just a splash of Tapatio - or you can use tabasco. Muddle it with mint and simple syrup, fresh limes, and use a good tequila and cointreau....Mmmm Fantastico. Splash soda water on top.
