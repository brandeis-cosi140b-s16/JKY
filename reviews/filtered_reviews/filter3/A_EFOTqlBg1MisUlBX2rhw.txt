We came here for dinner tonight.  We have been to La Salsa in SoCal, but while the logo is similar, this place was different.

The good:
Salsa was fresh
My hubby really liked his taco entree
The chips were good.

The bad:
There was only one salsa - mild - when CA La Salsa has a salsa bar that is very good.
They charge for chips and salsa
They charge you to pay with a credit card
We had to ask for refills on our water

The food was good - it could have been 4 star, but the service was subpar.
