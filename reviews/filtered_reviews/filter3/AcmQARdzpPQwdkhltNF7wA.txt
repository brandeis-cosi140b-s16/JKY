Nice new Mexican place in the south park with reasonable prices.  

The place is brightly colored and bigger than it looks from the outside entrance.  The place is still finding it's stride as there was some confusion between hostesses and wait staff.    The outside patio is really nice is the weather is cooperating. 

Their two salsa's with the chips were great. Spicy Red salsa and a creamy white spicy salsa. 

Coming Colorado, I crave a good green chili.  So far i haven't found anyplace that can compare to local west chili's, but this place green chili sauces were still good.  I have the deluxe chicken with their green chili sauce.  It has some neat heat and flavor, but I'm picky with my chilies.

The appetizer sampler was pretty big and offered a good sample.  Also, get the house margarita if its a Tuesday.  ( its on special.)
