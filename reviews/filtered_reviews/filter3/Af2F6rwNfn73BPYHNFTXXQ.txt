My brother recommended for our group dinner, so I checked out the website; seemed authentic so good food would be had. I called ahead to pick up a to-go order. Or I should say, tried to order over the phone. They answered, put me on hold, and never came back. I hung up 5 minutes later because I was already at the restaurant. I called ahead b/c I had two hungry kids in my car and was just trying to minimize the time it would take to get the food in their mouths. After I ordered, I saw the cook tell the cashier that he didn't give her a heads up on an order, so apparently they had to start over. that order was mine, and it took awhile to remedy, as two other families got served before my order was ready. While waiting, I saw the cashier pick up tongs to flip the meat (no gloves) and I think he burned his arm reaching across the grill. Doesn't come across as sanitary when the guy handling dirty money is also cooking. The salsa bar did look expansive and I scooped 4 different options for us, but if this is a typical experience, it's not worth it for me. Only gets the third star because the food was tasty.
