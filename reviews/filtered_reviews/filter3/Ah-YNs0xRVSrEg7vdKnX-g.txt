I frequent this Valle Luna often because my grandmother loves it. It has been one of her favorite restaurants for over 3 decades and what grammie wants grammie gets. 

The gradual decline in the customer service has become painfully obvious over the years. The food usually arrives in different intervals, and often before we get our silverware. The tables are so close together you have to practically scream to hear your dining partners. The salsa is flavorful yet has no spice, and the last cheese crisps we ordered were soggy and undercooked. The silverware is disgusting, they've obviously been using it for over 30 years. 

We went last night and observed one of the most incompetent and rude hosts in history. He was a smart ass teenage blond boy that kept pronouncing peoples names wrong. I watched as he past over two separate groups due to the mispronunciations (can he not read his own writing?) I couldn't take it anymore and hipped them to the situation, he responded with indignant rudeness instead of apologies. Luckily for him the group was half tanked from sitting in the bar so they waited to be seated before complaining. 

Now all this aside. Valle Luna makes the best grilled pork chimichanga I have ever tasted. Hands Down. Order it, gain 5 pounds, thank me later. 

5 star chimi, 1 star service, = 3 star review.
