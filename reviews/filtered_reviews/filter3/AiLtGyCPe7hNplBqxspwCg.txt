I'm personally burnt out on the whole hipster thing. I guess because it's been a popular trend for a really long time in cities other than Phoenix. I kind of feel like it's almost pass√© now days. 

However, whenever I want to get my hipster fix I come to places like this and listen to 20 something year olds talk about all the cool stuff they like and all the mainstream stuff they think is lame, while dressed exactly like every other hipsterific poser in the place that studies American Apparel billboards. I guess it's better than the 45 year old hipsters of Silverlake, but whatevs.

Anyhow, sure, it's a cool place. It looks cool. The drinks are pretty good too. I had some food here once. It was good, as in it didn't taste frozen or microwaved, but flavor wise it was just ok- nothing epic.
