Great location right on Las Vegas Bvld! It is even better that It is opened late (i think 24 hrs?). I stopped by after a night of clubbing and drinking. It definitely hit the spot. Possibly the cheapest food on the Strip! Everything was salty IMO. A squeeze of lime made it better. 
-Cow brain: yes you heard me! Try it. I had cow brain before and this was not too tasty and fresh. I think it lost some creaminess and the flavor was not working for me. Fun to try. Not the best I've had. 
-Tripe - my second favorite. tripe was clean and tender. 
-Beef shoulder - my favorite. Beef was tender. 
-Lengua - It was not good. Too salty. 
Would I come back? maybe if it was late and I was hungry. Good location but not the best tacos I've had.
