Have been eating here for years and they sometimes have better than average Mexican food. Unfortunately, the food is often very inconsistent. They have excellent chips and salsa, and pretty good enchiladas. They're stingy with the meatballs in the albondigas, and I was pretty ticked off one time a while back at how much they charged me for an extra plate to split an entree with my Mom. So I'll probably continue to eat here on occasion, especially since it's SO close to my house and they do have really good chips and salsa... I just wish their other entree's were consistently good so I could venture out and order something other than the chicken enchiladas with red sauce. IE: last time I had ordered Enchilada Suizas the green sauce had a really bitter, funny taste to it. I know it's been good in the past... so..? Another example, my Mom had a chicken special the very first time I took her there that was recommended by Frank himself and ugh it really was terrible, really dry and borderline inedible. So, now I just order what I generally know I'll like and stick with that, and for that reason I'm sure I'll continue to eat here but also why I really can't rate it as high as I would like to, or what I think they could do if they had better quality control in their kitchen.
