Went with a group of 4, venturing into the bar area for drinks and dinner after being told when we called for a reservation that the earliest was 11:30pm! The food is good, but not great. I had the shrimp and crab stuffed enchiladas, which is served with a small scoop of rice and beans, one margarita, and shared guacamole. My share of the bill was $60.00, with the drink being $15! We sat at the bar and the bartenders were very attentive, as was the bus staff. I just felt that it was just too pricey for what is delivered. 

Be prepared that the bar area is very noisy with background music blaring from overhead speakers.
