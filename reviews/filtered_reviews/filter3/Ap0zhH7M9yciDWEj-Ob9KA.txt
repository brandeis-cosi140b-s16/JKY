Bean & Cheese Burrito is a winner here, as are the breakfast burritos in the morning.  Service is fairly fast and there's ample parking at this location.

A few gripes...  

1.  None of the salsas are "hot".  Not even the "extra hot" one.  They need to rename those, or actually make them at least a little bit hot.
2.  The chips & salsa ratio is seriously way off.  Few chips with a rather large salsa portion. 
3.  The miniature salsa portion with the burritos is a joke, especially since chips do not come with the burrito like they do at some alternative places like Rubios and such.  Even if someone wanted to dip their burrito into the miniature cup, it is too small, and the portion is too small to be of much use for gently adding it to one's burrito as it is eaten.
4.  Adding onto #3 above, why not just add chips to the burrito order so the salsa isn't so lonely, or take away the salsa and drop the prices by 20 cents or so?
