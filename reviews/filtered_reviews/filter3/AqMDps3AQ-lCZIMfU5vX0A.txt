First, the burgers are really awesome! But ordering in the drive-thru is so frustrating because they can't hear you. Last night we waited for 20 minutes with only two cars ahead of us. We finally get to the window and not so much as a "hey, sorry it took so long".  The tacos are just ok. Good burgers and fries but you cannot expect people to wait for 20 minutes and not even acknowledge it. We may go back but if there's more than one car ahead of us, I won't wait.
