My bf and I had been here before. The food was  great and creative. Today we arrived for our reservation that stated we had a dog. When we arrived we were told service dogs only were allowed, although that was not mentioned when making the reservation. We had been allowed to have him two previous times before. The patio at the time was empty. We had to change out party location last minute.
