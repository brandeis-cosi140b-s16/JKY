Wife and I tried Arriba on our short trip to Arizona...and my overall experience was it was okay.  Nothing really blew me away.  We first ordered the Nachos for appetizers which were good, nothing special, but good.  It was also huge in portion size!  Could feed about 6 people!  I then ordered the Carne Asada which, eh, was just okay.  We may visit this place again to give it another try.

In summary, okay food, okay service, okay prices.
