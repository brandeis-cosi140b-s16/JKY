We went here after reading the fantastic Yelp reviews. This place is great. A unique twist on traditional Mexican food. 

Delightful combination of flavors, textures and color.  I think it's my new favorite place. 

Cheese enchiladas, shrimp fajitas, chicken fienstien and shrimp tacos all great portions and high on quality and high on flavor. 

The flan was amazing and the tres leches and fried ice cream were also pretty darn good. 


So why only 3 stars? The server/service  is part of the atmosphere and can make or break a dining experience. 

Jessie our server was cold and impersonal. I have never had a server appear to be so disinterested. I am hoping he was just having an off day and that he is normally as  upbeat and helpful as the restaurants other servers.  He's attitude and demeanor greatly diminished our experience.  

At the end of the meal he actually had another server bring us out check. Interesting ... and not in a good way. 

I would absolutely return and highly recommend this place if you want excellent food in an upscale and relaxed atmosphere.
