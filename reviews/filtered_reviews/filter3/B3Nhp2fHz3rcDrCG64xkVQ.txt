Great margaritas & food!!! No heartburn with these Margs thanx to fresh squeezed sweet n sour mix. The steak skewers & carne asada tacos are Tote delish!!!! 3 star only because service at tables is hit n miss... Service at the BAR is always EXCEPTIONAL, quick & friendly so if you are on a time schedule I recommend sitting there. But, I am not in a hurry so I will sit back relax & enjoy:)
