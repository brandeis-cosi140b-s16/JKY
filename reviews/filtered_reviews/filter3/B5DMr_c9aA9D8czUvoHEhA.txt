I was a little disappointed with the food at Escobar's. The place was recommended to me by a friend as being one of the better restaurants in Champaign, and the menu online looked interesting, so I decided to give it a try for dinner. The restaurant is really big and was pretty empty when I went (around 8pm on a Tuesday night). 

After pigging out on the complimentary bread and drinking a mango margarita (tasty if a bit too sweet maybe), I started with an appetizer of fried calamari. I should better than to order seafood in the middle of Illinois: it was certainly not terrible, but it wasn't great either... a letdown for the calamari lover that I am. I then ordered the duck breast: the duck itself was not very good (not very tender and slightly overcooked), and it came with steamed vegetables (boring), mashed sweet potatoes (not bad but a little plain), fried plantain chips (good), and roasted pears (definitely the highlight of the dish: these were actually quite delicious). Overall... not a terrible entree but still quite disappointing and a little overpriced. To their defense, the portions were very large and I was completely stuffed by the time I left the restaurant. Friendly service.
