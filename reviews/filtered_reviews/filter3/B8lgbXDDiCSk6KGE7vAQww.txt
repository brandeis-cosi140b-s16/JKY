Went here for lunch yesterday. The service was good, friendly and fast. The chips and salsa was the best part of the meal. I ordered crispy tacos, they were soggy and the shredded beef had no flavor. While the service was good and the complimentary salsa and bean dip was tasty, I wouldn't go back here. I can go to Roberto's and get a much better taco for far less.
