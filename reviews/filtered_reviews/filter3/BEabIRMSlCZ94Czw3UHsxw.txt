I would've given this place 4 stars if the wait to get a table and the wait to finally get drinks and our food had not been so ridiculously LONG.  It wasn't the restaurant's fault we had to wait 45 minutes for our table, but it is their fault that it took more than 30 minutes to get our drinks after we placed our order.  And they didn't even bring us waters in the mean time!

Even though this place is famous for its tortas, the tortas actually didn't look that appetizing.  My friends who ordered them described them as "Mexican burgers."  I'm not really into that, so I ordered the carne asada tacos.  They were tasty, and I actually finished all 3.  The sides of raw radishes and cucumbers were a little strange, but it wasn't bad.  If I were to go again (which I doubt because the wait was so long and there are plenty of other - better - Mexican restaurants in town) I would order the chicken quesadillas.  I tried a bite of one and it was really good.

On top of that it was pretty smoky inside the restaurant due to poor ventilation in the kitchen.  I hate leaving a restaurant and having my hair and clothes smell like smoke/food!
