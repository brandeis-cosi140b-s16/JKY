I've been here for dinner the first time and for lunch a few times after that.  Admittedly, after the first time, I almost didn't go back.  The service was pretty slow and the food was just ok.  But it did seem more authentic, than the typical tex/mex places around.  I was dying for tacos, so my husband and I decided to give it another shot for lunch.  I'm glad we did.  The tacos were great! They come with rice or beans.  I got the beans and they were also very tasty.  My husband got the Eggs Your Way w/Chorizo, Rice & Beans and LOVED it!   Margaritas are ok... not great... but they don't suck either.  I'm overdue for a visit and want to try the Chilaquiles Reyna!  I'll let ya know how that goes!
