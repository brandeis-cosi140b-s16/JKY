My husband and I visited early this week for lunch.  The decor was charming and inviting.  They serve you chips and two salsa bowls.  One green and one red.  I love spicy food but the red salsa tasted terrible to me.  The green, however, was very good.  He husband ordered enchiladas with the fried egg of top, he said it was very good.  He cleaned his plate.  I had a taco salad, and that was pretty good too.  If you order the queso cheese dip, don't expect it to taste like queso.  We thought it was nasty and smelled soured, didn't finish it after two bites.
