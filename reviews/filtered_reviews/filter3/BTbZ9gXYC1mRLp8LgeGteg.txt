Likes: This is not a traditional mexican restaraunt but more eclectic texmex. Good neighborhood location and fun atmosphere and decor with a variety of good margarita-inspired cocktails. Calamari is delicious and I highly recommend it! 

Gripes: The guacamole and cheese dip is mediocre at best. Honestly, it's hard to mess up fresh guacamole when fresh avocados are used (which they are here) but it tasted bland. The tacos are not consistent - some are great and some are just ok. If it were not for the location, I probably would not return.
