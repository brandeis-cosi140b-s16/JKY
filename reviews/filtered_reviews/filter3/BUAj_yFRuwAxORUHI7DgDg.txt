I really wanted to like this place - and I did - this is more of a 3.5 that I couldn't bring myself to round up.

I've been here several times. I've ordered several of the fish dishes (fish sandwich, fish tacos) and been pretty impressed, but just not blown away.

The cold ceviche is also quite good. 

Our meal came with free chips and salsa, which was a nice added bonus.

The service was okay. It's ranged from the standard "good" to slightly sleazy.

I'm not sure if this is just a Scottsdale thing, but I went to lunch with three (male) coworkers. I ordered a margarita at lunch and the waiter, a younger guy, put his hand on my shoulder and asked if I liked my drink. I just thought it was super weird, but I might be overreacting.
