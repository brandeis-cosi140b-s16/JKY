Although my kids seem to love it here,  this place is always a hit or miss.  The service is never consistent. We went in today for lunch around 2pm. It was my daughter's choice for her birthday and she invited a few friends. It didn't seem too busy as we were seated quickly with no wait. There was 10 of us,  4 adults and 6 kids.  After getting our drink orders it took a while for the server to come back to get our meal order.  I've noticed this a few times before when it didn't look busy. They only have one or two servers working the dining area but at the same time they seem to be overworked because they're under staffed. The food was great however,  we always get our fill of chips, beans, and salsa while we wait for our meal. I ordered the steak Mexicana which was delicious and cooked perfectly. Again, the server came by once to ask how everything was and if we needed refills. By the time we were done,  we had to give obvious signs we were ready for our check (hubby left with the kiddies to get situated in the car, turn on AC). The server came about 5 minutes later. Our bill wasn't as expensive as I thought it would be which made me feel a little better.  The food is good and priced right to fit my family's budget. Despite the lack of service, we will always come back. Hopefully they will work on getting it better.
