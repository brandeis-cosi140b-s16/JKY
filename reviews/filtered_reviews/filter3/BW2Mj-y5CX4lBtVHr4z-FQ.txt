The food is decent, the service is decent. They are very kind and outgoing, but they mess up a lot. They always fix it very apologetically, but they mess up more often than not here. The margaritas are on point- strong and flavorful. The chips and salsa are so yummy, and can't beat the free price with Yelp check in!! Also the flan is delicious. 

I'm a fan of the big daddy burrito, as well as the fiesta nachos.
