This place is ok.  Been here once and just don't understand the great reviews.  It's not terrible.  It's mediocre.

I've had their vegetarian burrito, and it was good.  Not great, but good.  I guess I expect a restaurant to be great when the reviews overall are above a 4.  It makes me wonder what I'm missing.

My husband had their chicken taco and didn't like it because the chicken was in breaded nuggets/strips.  I doubt anyone expects a chicken taco to have breaded chicken it.  He sure didn't, and he really didn't like it.  His tastebuds are pretty easy to please when it comes to basic stuff like this, and he didn't even like it.

I also had the Caribbean Martini and it was great.  The ONLY downside to it was that it wasn't filled to the top.  It literally was filled a full inch from the top. No exaggeration.  Since it was happy hour and cheap (I think it cost around $2), I didn't complain.  It tasted great, though!

I think the key thing this place has going for it is its central location.  It's easy to get to, and has a big parking lot.  If you want really good Mexican go to Los Dos Molinos (not super vegetarian friendly, but a few options -- meat eaters and lovers of spice will especially like it here).  If it's just tacos you're after, go to Two Hippies, and if you really want to mix (or confuse) your palate in a fun way, head over to Chino Bandito for a Mexican/Asian combined menu.
