Oh this CA girl who formerly believed Z'Tejas was Tex-Mex. Now being a recent Austin resident, I know this is not Tex-Mex. I was not happy that I had to valet my car-this is not the type of restaurant that needs it. I guess it's due to the high density of restaurants & shops as well as the close proximity to campus that makes this a necessity. I guess it's helpful.

I like the happy hour deals on appetizers, which means I did not spend as much money. Enjoyed the dumplings; Ahi was ok; pulled-pork nachos were meh; catfish tacos not so much.

My Z'Tejas Saviors: Corn Bread. I will go back just for the corn bread. Tableside guacamole-yes please! The portion is too big for just two people though and I really doubt anyone would want to bring it home.
