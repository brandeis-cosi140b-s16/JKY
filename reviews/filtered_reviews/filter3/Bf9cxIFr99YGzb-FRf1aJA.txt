The food was just below Okay. Just below it. I mean, I'm in the southwest, I can expect some authentic mexican fare regardless if I'm in a mall right??....Okay, so for mall food, it was above average. Prices were decent, portions were decent, service was okay. The bloody mary bar for brunch - that was unexpected and the only reason I would ever come back to this place. Brilliant idea!
