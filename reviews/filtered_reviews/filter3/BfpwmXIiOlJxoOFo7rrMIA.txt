Cantina Laredo is a nice mexican restaurant.  If you like super salty chips you'll love these chips.  There are two different types of salsa, a cold and a hot.  The hot salsa has a smokier, spicier flavor than the cold.  Both are really tasty.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas with sour cream poblano sauce.  They were ok at best.  The chicken had no flavor and the sauce was kind of bland.  The pinto beans were really good and the spanish rice was average.  My husband had the carnitas.  The meat was super tender and fell off bone.  He ordered a side of flour tortillas so he could make tacos with the meat.  He had a side of mixed vegetables that consisted of zucchini, red peppers and squash.  He said that they were seasoned perfectly, and he doesn't even like zucchini.  He also had a side of rice and a margarita.  All and all the meal was good and relatively cheap at only $45.
