I had a good experience here when I took my mom to lunch. So this is a sit down place! They emphasize that they are not fast food. 

This is fusion Mexican and Korean food. Great concept! This is what I'd consider a whole in the wall.

They brought out complimentary chips with salsa and guac. Small serving but complimentary so not a complaint at all. Just a note.

We shared kimchi fried rice and a bulgogi fusion burrito. The kimchi fried rice was good! We got a full serving for $10 I think? And we added an egg on top which was extra. It was full of kimchi flavor, it was saucy, and the egg on top was delicious. We had it with beef as the meat of choice.

The burrito was kind of small for the price and wasn't anything special. I don't know if I ordered wrong and just got a regular beef burrito but the flavor of bulgogi wasn't present to me. It tasted like they used fresh ingredients but it really lacked in flavor. It wasn't bad but I just was expecting a lot more flavor. There was nothing that made it "fusion" except the meat but that didn't really work out for me. 

Overall I'd give this place a 3 or 3.5 based off of this experience. 

Some suggestions would be to change their service. They don't do the whole server and sit down thing well and would probably benefit to just do a Roberto's type of ordering thing. Otherwise they should have a real service. Like get a host stand would be step one. I don't want to go into detail but I just think this would really help. Or maybe a number system. 

Also maybe it was just me but they should marinade their bulgogi more. 

The Kim chi fried rice is really good though. They don't shy away from the Kim chi flavor and that's a good thing. My mom hates eating other Asian foods that aren't Thai and she actually raved about this. The fried rice was the saving grace. 

The young woman working was nice and I'd totally go back to try other things and give them another chance.
