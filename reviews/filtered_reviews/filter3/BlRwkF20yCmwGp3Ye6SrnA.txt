The dining experience at 360 Gourmet Burrito was a total 180 compared to the previous 1 star reviews.  The lady cashier was very kind processing my order and to no surprised either as I could tell she was from the Philippines were courtesy and kindness is the norm.  The excellent service continue as I only waited a minute or two for my Thai wrap.

When comparing their burrito to Chiptole's, the 360 burrito has a lengthier tortilla flour wrap; however, there was an abundant amount of ingredients such as rice, shredded lettuce, and chicken.  The chicken was cooked well, e.g. not raw nor overly cooked.  The peanut sauce was slightly present inside the burrito. It definitely could have used more sauce or even a separate container of sauce to dip the burrito.

The Thai wrap was enjoyable to eat and fulfilled the job to hold me from starving during a 4.5 hour flight.  Perhaps 360 GB could enhance the Thai wrap's flavor by adding bean sprouts, cilantro, and/or daikon.  If that day comes I'll increase my rating to 4 stars.
