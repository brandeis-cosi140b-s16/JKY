Food- yes it's decent. Chips and salsa good but how can you mess that up. Soups- great tasting. But the service in this place is lacking immensely. I saw in other reviews that service tends to fall off at night since the owner may not be in the place. That is does. First we ordered iced teas NO F@CKING LEMON. He repeated no lemon and what do you know we get lemons. We hate darn lemons. Food comes, appetizer and dinner all at the same time. We hate that too. Lastly trying to get the check!!!!! Damn were trying to pay here.... Where did Duke go? Who knows ...we finally flag someone down , pay and leave... Probably won't be back. Oh and when we got there were told 20 minute wait.. Huh the restaurant is empty
