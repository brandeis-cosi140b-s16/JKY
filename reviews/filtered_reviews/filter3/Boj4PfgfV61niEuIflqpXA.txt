$1 dolla tacos. thats all i gotta say. 

Come here for those tacos (chicken is better) and some cheap drinks and you'll leave a happy camper. I believe it might be open 24hr/day so perfect after a long night of partying or losing your money! 

The only complaint I have is the length it takes to get your food. I came here twice in one night. The first time was the taco experience, which like a said - left as a happy camper. Second time I came was around 5AM and ordered a chicken quesadilla and onion rings to-go. The order took about 35 minutes to make. I thought it was a pretty long wait, given that they were pretty slow at this time. 

Other than that, cool place to grab some cheap food and drinks before or after your night!
