They try for high end Mexican but really miss the mark. Palomas and guac are good, chips are greasy. Ordered citrus chicken quesadilla that was to come with carmelized onions but got none. Tasteless, blah do not recommend. Boyfriend got the yuca tan pork that had very strong cinnamon flavoring--nothing subtle about it. Service was ok but you feel like you're just getting pushed through. Wouldn't return...except for a quick drink.
