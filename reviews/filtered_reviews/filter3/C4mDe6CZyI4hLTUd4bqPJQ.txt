If I'm ever up for a grease-laden meal, I know where to go. The carnitas was probably my favorite item from my combo meal. Meat was tender and juicy. Jade red chicken reminded me of Panda Express Orange Chicken just with a different sauce. Fried rice seemed a bit dry. Refried black beans had a nice spicy kick to them.
