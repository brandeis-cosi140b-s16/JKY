YUMMY for the tummy.  

I loooove the chicken tacos.  Good and fresh and perfect.  The chips and salsa and good too.  The salsa provided is hot and mild, two different options, which is always nice.

The service is good, although can be slow at times.  It's hit and miss if this place will be busy or not and seems atypical of "normal" business times. 

Food is a bit overpriced, especially for Mexican food, and in Arizona, where you can get just as good for a bit lower priced than Los. 

Overall, good quality food.
