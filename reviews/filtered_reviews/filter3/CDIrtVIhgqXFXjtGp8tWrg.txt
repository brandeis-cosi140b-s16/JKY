I went there on a Groupon  a waiter will come up to your table and give you chips and salsa. Then he/she will ask guacamole or cheese?  They don't tell you it's 4.99. Then if you ask for a hotter chili  that's 3.99 extra. Just make sure you are willing to pay for the stuff they sneak up on your table..the tacos are good though.
