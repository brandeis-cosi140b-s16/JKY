The tacos are authentic but they are not great. I'm sure the adobada taco is the reason why they get such good reviews, but the different lines are ridiculous. The lines at the strip location were unbearable. I am not sad to see it go. The prices aren't that great when you consider everything is a la carte. There are better Mexican options in town. I'm sure most of their reputation is in the fact that the strip location was cheap in comparison to all the things around it.
