Close to my new office so of course i gotta try a few times.

I'm still trying to figure out if this is a good location for a biz ( next door to " not your average deli " there was a hawaiian pizza place that didn't last ad you don't see the biz from the main street - decatur ) 

I've tried the carnitas burrito ( i think it was $5 or so ...sorry i forget ) 

and i tried the carnita's nachos ( about same price  ) 

nacho's were tasty -  decent amount of meat on them  but needed some salsa.

The burrito - waaaay to much bean ! 

The place is boring and the food matches the vibe .

Before i give  the thumbs down i'll need to try the tacos since         
Mr. Taco Clint gave it high marks
