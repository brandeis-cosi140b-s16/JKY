finally! the place slowed down a bit to stop in for a quick bite. it was MLK day, so i thought the crowd would be obsolete, NOT SO! it slowed for a minute, kinda like the waters parting, and then as i placed my order, and had a chat with Andy, the line swelled up again!!!! He said its all been done organically, no advertising, just word of mouth. Must be the BIG A_S tacos. They are litterally bursting with food. I tried the 3 pack of fish tacos. The fish was tender and delicious, however the rice and beans inside the taco was a new twist (next time that goes on the side!) that is where the filling comes from. I'm more of a fish, lettuce, cheese, salsa and lemon fish-taco-kinda-girl so the place only got a 3. However i'm sure on my second visit, the one where there won't be any rice or beans in my taco, will be a deliciously heaven like trip. If your a salsa freak (like my seester & I) this salsa is not for you. neither the green or red is tasty or hot, think salsa for americans.

 its so close to my place too! kudos on the local, glad the previous boutique moved (otherwise where would this tiny all inclusive place be?)

on a side note; the owner and his bro are the creators of Long Wongs Wings and Hippy Brother Burgers and they still have it!!! The place is a kitschy place. You go Andy ^_~ hope they come to Grand Avenue soon......
