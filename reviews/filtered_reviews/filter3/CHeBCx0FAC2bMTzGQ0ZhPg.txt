Stopped in for a snack and drink.  Patio is nice, but the uncovered tables can be ridiculously hot.  drinks were ok... good, but nothing special.  salsa and guacamole are good.  chips were pretty bad.  i think they make their own, but the oil wasn't hot enough or something.  they were super greasy, but also tough. bleh.  i also got the lobster taquitos.  sounded interesting, so figured i'd try something different.  regretted that move.  not good.  the lobster tasted super fishy (never a good sign).  had to drown them in salsa and guac to make them edible.  it's a meh kind of a place.
