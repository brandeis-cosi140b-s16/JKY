Food was ok. I had the al pastor burrito. Pretty small for $12.95. Apparently the burrito just comes with meat. On the menu it says they'll put beans & rice inside "on request" so I requested it. The waiter looked at me and said "you do get beans & rice on the side" and I said "I know. I'd like it in the burrito too please" and for some reason, he didn't look too happy. 

When the food came, no beans & rice inside. Kinda figured that was gonna happen. He wasn't a great server.
