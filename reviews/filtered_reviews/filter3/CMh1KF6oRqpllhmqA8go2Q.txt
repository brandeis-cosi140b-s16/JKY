Been here twice. One time a solid 4 stars, and today was 2 ... at best, so I'm gonna average that out to 3.  Stay away from the Carne Asada as it was pretty dry & bland. 

I had the Green chili burrito before & it was great.  Rice & Beans are always good. Service is ok.

My word of advice is research the reviews and stick with what people here are saying is good .. because it really can be good, but the bad can be oh so bad......
