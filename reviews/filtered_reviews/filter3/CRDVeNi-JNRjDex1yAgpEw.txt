Meh....  It looks like a chain. Has service like a chain. It's a chain. 

I have missed Mexican food, since we moved away from Arizona. I knew better than to make my long awaited return, to go explore a chain restaurant, but my parents recommended Abuelo's. 

Nothing was bad, but everything was average. Guacamole had flavor, but texture was like it came straight out of a gallon tin can. I had the chile relleno plate.  Enjoyed the shredded beef relleno, but did not finish my plate. 

I will seek out family run Mexican food joints.  I think Abuelo's will primarily be popular because of 3 words: location, location, location.
