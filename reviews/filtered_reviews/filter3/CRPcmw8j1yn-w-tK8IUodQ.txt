Fusion is dangerous territory. You either pull it off or you don't.

Unfortunately it was a miss for us on all counts and we ordered over four dishes. 

Taco Maria in CA is the epitome of great fusion w Mexican flavors.

I think for the price, you would do far better at La Hacienda in AZ. For a tastier, cheaper alternative try Barrio Queen. Both are less fusiony though.
