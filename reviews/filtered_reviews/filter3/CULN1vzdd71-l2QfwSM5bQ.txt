Not being from Scottsdale, Arizona or even the Southwest, I'm not entirely sure how I ended up all the way out at this joint or how where this place is still qualifies as Scottsdale.  A girl said "Meet me here" and like a good boy with nothing but the best of intentions, I complied.

Nonetheless, the food is very decent, and I would recommend that you ask for a side of the hot green sauce, which is entirely constituted from peppers with the same name as the restaurant.  It adds a lot.  

If this place were a planet in our solar system and Phoenix was the sun, you'd be dining on Neptune, but if you happen to be out this way and don't know any better, you'll be happy.
