I'm a little surprised with myself for expecting this place to be better than what it was. The only reason that it's getting 3 stars is that the waitress (Danielle) was super nice. There were issues with our drink order (it was made wrong the first time and brought to me in a dirty glass the 2nd time around) and the appetizer was brought out with pico de gallo all over it after we asked for it with no pico. But that was all taken care off quickly and the manager even took the nacho appetizers off of the ticket (actually insisted after we told her not to worry about it because they made it correct and quick after we pointed the issue out). I can look past mistakes. Things happen. 

The low star rating is due to the fact that the food, really just isn't that good. We got the filet mignon nachos for the appetizer and the steak had little to no flavor. The refried beans seriously tastes like what I get out of a store bought can, & the guacamole tastes prepackaged. We also shared a combo fajita plate for 2 w/ chicken and shrimp, and we were completely underwhelmed with the flavors. If I were to sum up what I thought of their food with one word, it would be meh.
