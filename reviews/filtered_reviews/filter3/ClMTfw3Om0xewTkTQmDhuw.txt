The reason I would come back to this place, and I think the major draw for most of the patrons is not the food. What is exceptional here is the atmosphere, the interior design and the concept.

Let's start with the good. The huge stained glass windows and the giant spherical wrought iron chandelier give this place killer ambiance. The huge open space doesn't lend itself to intimacy, but it's a great place to bring a group for drinks and a conversation.

There is one fatal flaw, and that is a common flaw with places like this: the food doesn't live up to the decor. Gourmet tacos are a great concept, but if you're going to put gourmet prices on your gourmet concept tacos, they better blow me away. I tried every gourmet taco on the menu, and none of them were memorable, or worth $5.

Good thing for Taco Guild that there isn't an actual Taco Guild. Because their tacos probably wouldn't make the cut.
