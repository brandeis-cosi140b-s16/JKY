Food was OK - and the best thing we ate was the guacamole made table-side. My wife compared her tamales to those from a jar, and my chili rellenos was average. The draft Negra Modello was tasty, but the margarita was nothing special. The Flan was good - but a great deal larger than our server indicated, so we could've shared one and been happy. Being close to the Zumanity theater was our primary reason for stopping here - and in a pinch we'd stop again.
