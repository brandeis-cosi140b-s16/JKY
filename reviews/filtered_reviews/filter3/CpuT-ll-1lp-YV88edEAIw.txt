One Liner: Good for lots of margaritas and food

Food: (scale of 0-4) 2.2
You get a lot of food for very little damage. The salsa is awesome. The hot salsa taste a bit more chemical and it isn't really hotter either. Whatever you order, you get plenty of food. This is a great place for getting full while getting some margaritas.
