Granted, they did take our reservation for 20 just several hours before we were to arrive.....and we did bring in a group of 20 to have dinner and drinks.  Still, the service and food left a lot to be desired.  

The two waitress (for our large group) lacked personalities.  The food took foreverrrr......which would seem like a good time to sell some margaritas, but we had to ask for seconds.  Then the food came out, and my rice was cold.  

Still, my black bean burrito was good and they kept the chips and salsa flowing and split the checks nicely.   Next time, I'll come with a smaller group.
