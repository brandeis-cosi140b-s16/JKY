Definitely an authentic and delicious spot for Mexican food and tacos, although it's not the best of its kind in the Valley.  The tripe taco was fantastic - great texture and flavor - and I'd come back just for that.  I'm not sure I'd do the same for the carne asada, which was good but not as flavorful as it could be, cabeza, which was similarly less flavorful than I'd hoped and more reliant on texture for its kudos, and the fish taco, which was buried in sauce and otherwise not worth mentioning.  The tortillas are a little dense and also a little lacking in the flavor department - again, there's better to be found in the Valley (and, despite La Tolteca's extremely reasonable prices, for cheaper).  

The chilaquiles, however, are a dish to behold.  A giant platter of still crispy but sauce-laden tortilla chips, egg, meat, queso, avocado, sour cream, onion, and cilantro - it's full of flavor, heavy on texture, well-balanced on spice and hearty as all hell.  Paired with an ice cold bottled beer, it's great any time of day.  You could try to save room for one of the pastries in the glass case located in the market portion of the restaurant (just behind the counter where you order as the market and restaurant seem to bleed together), but we couldn't manage it last time we were there.
