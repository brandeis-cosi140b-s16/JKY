Okay.... Where was the strawberry salsa? The Guacamole was gone too.  I went here with my sister and was so confused with the menu. It was posted on the wall and it was so hard to read. Why was it posted on the side and not in the front? The place was okay. I ordered the the shrimp tacos and got fish. They messed up my order, but they were busy...oh well. The fish was good though, so I didn't complain. I'll try it again and give it another chance.
