I went to Pepe's Taco last night.  I had an interesting experience.  I ordered the Asada Fries which was different from what I usually had in the past.  I typically get my fries from Robertos.  Pepe's Taco makes their fries fatter and thicker which were a nicer difference.  They also put nacho cheese over their fries, sour cream, guacamole, and of course the asada.  I think I like the ones from Robertos better because the meat is thicker and I like the salsa that they add on it.  I ordered my food to go and it did take a bit but I think it is because there were quite a few people before me.

They have a wide variety of meat options such as goat as well as the typical asada, chicken and ect.  They do have lunch specials but those are offered from Sun- Thur from 12-4. 

Inside they have a jukebox which is really cool because I have never seen one in real life.  They play Mexican music which is understandable because it is a Mexican Restaurant.   

I do like that I can see the workers cooking their food.  I was able to watch them prepare my food and watch them cooking limes.  I think they were a bit creeped out because I was just watching them.  Pepe's Taco does have a nice salsa bar which has green salsa, red salsa, some carrots and onions, and I think they were radishes.  I felt my Asada Fries were decent, but next time I will go to get some tacos.  They are called Pepe's Tacos afterall.
