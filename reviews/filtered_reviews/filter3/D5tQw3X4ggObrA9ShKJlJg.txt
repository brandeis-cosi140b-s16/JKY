Back when I was meeting new people, soon after moving here from Ohio, we went here on a Friday for happy hour. I wasn't impressed then; I'm not impressed now.

Sylvia's reminds me of that former lover, without whom I couldn't imagine breathing much less going on with life. But after some time apart, you realize that there is more to living. And when you have them back in your life you understand that your time apart was the best time ever. Now, you think it was a mistake to ever get involved. That's how Sylvia's plays in my life. It was there at a time when I thought it was necessary but have grown to understand we were never meant to be.

Sorry Sylvia's. I'm taking my class ring back.
