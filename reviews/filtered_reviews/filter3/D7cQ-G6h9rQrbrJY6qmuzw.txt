Food was OK, service was spotty.  We had good service early on getting attention from our waiter, the runner and others.  Once we got our food the waiter disappeared.

I got a combo with a Chicken Taco, Beef Enchilada and a Verde pork burrito.  The Verde was by far the star, I would order that again.  The taco and enchilada were bland and not worth ordering again.  

The commentaries were a mixed bag.  You get soup, bean dip, salsa and chips.  Chips were good, salsa was on the spicy side which worked for me but was too spicy for the rest of my group, bean dip was bland and boring, the soup too was bland but I added a spoon full of salsa and it became worth eating.
