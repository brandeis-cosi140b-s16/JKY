El Encanto is one of those old-time restaurants of Arizona. As Durant's Steakhouse, McAlpine, Tee Pee, Sugar Bowl, Red Devil, all have roots in Arizona dating back decades. 

The food at El Encanto is good overall, with a few small overlooked details. First, the Carnitas can be a bit on the fatty side. Second, when the food arrives, don't expect it all to be served at the same time. I was dining the other evening at El Encanto, a table of 5, it took 3 trips to serve us all, over the course of 5 minutes. 

The margaritas tend to be a bit thin as well, they need to adopt a recipe that requires more then a margarita mixer and tequila. Fresh lime juice is always a great place to start!

I do enjoy the space itself, very relaxing, great restaurant to go and chill with friends. The menu has had an overhaul in the past year, reducing it to a fraction of what it was. My advice, expand the menu to not include just the Sonora stuff (tacos, enchiladas, etc) but add some items that you can't get on every corner in Phoenix. Overall a slightly above average experience.
