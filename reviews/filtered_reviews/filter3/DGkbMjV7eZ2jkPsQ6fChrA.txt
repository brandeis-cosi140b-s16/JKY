A penny margarita..thank you very much yelp!! Came here with my family for the first time tonight. I'd say it deserves three and a half stars, wishing it was an option. Was pretty empty for a Saturday night which was nice because it was quiet. 
I enjoyed the purple lights in the restaurant haha, thought it added to the atmosphere. Just liked how it looked in general! Got chips and salsa and they were ok. Would've liked a more flavorful salsa. The spinach type chips were interesting. Also kinda stinks that you have to pay for more chips because most places you do not have to. Our server was great, he deserves 5 stars, got everything right and did everything in a timely matter, etc. 
I got my penny margarita thanks to yelp! Tasted a bit watered down, but for a penny I'd say it was worth it for sure. I decided on veggie fajitas without sour cream and with corn tortillas. They came sizzling! One thing I liked was the variety of vegetables, there were a lot of different kinds of veggies which made me happy. Also came with a good helping of guac. The beans were meh. Vegetables were good but a little bit over cooked for my liking. But overall a satisfying meal.
