Wahoo's is a fast casual chain serving bowls, burritos, tacos, and enchiladas melding Mexican, Brazilian, and Asian flavors. I'll usually get their fish their tacos which they're known for, and they usually don't disappoint. I've had no complaints with service with any of my visits.

The view separates this location from others as you can see both the summit of Black Mountain and you can can also have an unobstructed view of the entire Valley if you choose to sit at the bar or out on the patio weather permitting. The dining area is spacious with plenty of tables and some booths against the wall.

When you order, you have the choice of protein for your dish which includes: chicken, carnitas, carne asada, fish, shrimp, and tofu. The food is OK to me and on par with most taquerias and teriyaki bowl places with their fish tacos being worth return trips for. Everything else is a notch pricier to other establishments but not significantly elevated in flavor. On this particular visit, I had the carne asada Outer Reef Burrito- cheese, lettuce, rice, beans, green sauce with a side of salsa. The steak was flavorful, but I could have done without the lettuce.

If I'm in the vicinity, I'd come back for some fish tacos or maybe to chill out in the bar or out on the patio with cerveza in hand.
