Meh, it's kinda hit or miss. Really depends on the people you are there with, and depends on the fact that there's not going to be drunks trying to fight with someone over little things.

Food is ok (the regular tex-mex stuff). Their yinzerita is something that everyone raves about - i've never had it though. The huge fan at the top is some kind of a marvel I'll agree. It's nice in the spring/summer because it's nice and cool in the top floor (granted it gets ridiculously crowded however)

It's just something else to do on walnut
