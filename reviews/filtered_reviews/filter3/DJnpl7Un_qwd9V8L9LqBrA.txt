Like everyone else, I really enjoyed the tortillas. Fresh and obviously made in house, they really stood out. Also, the size of the tacos and meat portions are refreshingly generous. 

Sadly, the flavor of the chicken and asada was lacking. It was ok, but not over the top. The beans are decent, the rice is a bit dry and the chips were stale. Hot sauce selections are good and the squeeze bottles are nice. the pico de gallo that comes with the chips is pretty much alright, but the chips were stale.

#1 Combo w/Asada (bean and rice option)
4 X Chicken tacos
1 X Chips and salsa

Total was roughly $21.00 plus $2.00 tip. Not cheap, not over the moon expensive, but not really amazing from a taste perspective. Tortillas and portions saved the day.
