I had my first fish taco when I was 18. That's way too long to live without knowing how great of an idea that is. Beer-battered fish has been a part of my life since the fish fries I went to as a kid, and taco night was always a DIY-adventure. So the two together can be pretty awesome. Or, like many things in NoDa, they can be trendy (and a bit pricey).
Cabo Fish Taco's namesake is pretty good. They're not anything to sell my possessions for a surfboard over, but because I can't surf in Charlotte, I wouldn't do that anyway. I like the salsa blanca and how delicate yet filling these tacos are. Their queso takes a good hint of chipotle and is an excellent appetizer choice. Above all else, try the Mexi-Slaw, a chopped vegetable side that I like more than the traditional cole slaw.
Since the place is trendy, one of the hot spots in NoDa, the way is long. Very long. It's relieving to be finally seated, but the place is so bumping that it's hard to really get anyone's attention. Once a server comes over, they're more than happy to help though.
The scene's one thing, the food of the sea is another, and that's why I like Cabo Fish Taco but don't always want to go.
