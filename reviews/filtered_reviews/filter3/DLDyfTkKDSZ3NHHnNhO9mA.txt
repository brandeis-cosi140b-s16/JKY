Mucho Gusto is like that girl who if she just put out a little more effort she would be the love of your life but she never does. Mucho Gusto has so much potential but zero consistency. 

Now I have gone here probably five times and have had different experiences every time. Sometimes I get great food and great service then other times, like when I went for lunch today, I walk away disappointed. 

Overall the food here is decent. I typically go with the Trio Chicken Tacos with a side salad. They are a good size that will fill you up without giving you that afternoon food coma. The only negative is sometimes the salsa is too runny which makes the tortillas soggy and kind of gross. 

 The atmosphere is decent. It does have a good patio when it's not to hot to sit outside. However sometimes they play the music so loud you feel like you're at Que Club on Mill. If you looking for decent Mexican food in Tempe Mucho Gusto is your spot.
