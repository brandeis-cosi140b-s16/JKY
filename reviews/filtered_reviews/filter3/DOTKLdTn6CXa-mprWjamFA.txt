The pros: food was delicious, nice ambience (it's in the Cosmopolitan), very good service - my water glass was always full and waiter was attentive.

The cons: very pricey for what you get. I got a $5 tiny taco (equivalent to the $2 tacos aI had at Bally's a few days earlier, lol) and a $8.88 "street sandwich," which my friend said is normally $1-2 from food carts. My friend got the stuffed pepper, with pork and pomegranate seeds.

Both were delicious but way out of our price range - the pepper was $16! We didn't know it was going to be such small portions.

I guess the moral is go there if you have the money, but be warned it's all small plates. DELICIOUS small plates, but small nonetheless.
