I heard some great things about this place, so I had high expectations.  I wouldn't say my experience was a "normal" one, since we had a party of 12.  Please, keep that in mind when reading this review. I'm sure if you go with two people it would be completely different.  

Our server was friendly and attentive.  My only gripe was how long it took to get our food, and it wasn't exactly warm when we finally received it.  The flavors were great, though.  My favorite was the Al Pastor.  I also opted for a Chorizo Verde taco, just because I've never seen green Chorizo until last night!  

I think it's pretty cool that you can BYOB liquor and they make margs and mojitos for you.  I personally didn't try one, but the rest of the table said they were awesome.  

Overall, this is a great place for the neighborhood, but I'm just not sure if I'd travel from the northeast side of the city to come back.
