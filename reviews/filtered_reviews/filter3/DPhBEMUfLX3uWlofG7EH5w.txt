We had drinks and snacks at El Segundo Sol because Cafe Ba Ba Reeba in the same location had gone out of business when we arrived.  I'll miss Cafe Ba Ba Reeba's Cava Sangria and awesome tapas, but the new restaurant continues to offer tasty white and red sangria and friend peppers (my favorite tapa at Cafe BR).  We ordered table side guacamole which isn't really prepared table side.  The guacamole girl (that is how she identified herself) said there were too many tables in the way to push her preparation cart over to our table.  Her guacamole cart never moved and I'm pretty sure no guacamole is ever prepared table side.  They should rename it "20 feet away guacamole".  The drinks, chips and salsa were all good.  We didn't try the Mexican food, but I'm sure it's as good as typical Mexican food.  The service was great and our waitress was very competent.  I really liked the Caipirinha, which is the national drink of Brazil.  This place is no Cafe Ba Ba Reeba, but I might go back for more drinks and fried peppers.
