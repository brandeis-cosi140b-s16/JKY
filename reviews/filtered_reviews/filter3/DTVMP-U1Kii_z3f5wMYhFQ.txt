Where I work they have burrito Friday where they make a run here for breakfast so I have eaten many burritos from here... I always go with the #2 Green Chile (New Mexico green chilie with pork) or one of the breakfast burritos they tend to be on the dry side so always get a side of sour cream. It's a lot of food if you eat the whole thing it will be a gut bomb you will be full... I split one for the most part so I can still eat lunch.
