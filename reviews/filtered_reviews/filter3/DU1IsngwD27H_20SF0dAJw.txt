It was alright.  The drinks and food were pretty good.  The decor was a bit unusual; skate boards and graffiti type art.  Nothing wrong with it, just not exactly what I was expecting from a place called "El Hefe".  Anyway, in short, it is your typical Scottsdale bar, college students and cougars.  Not my normal scene, but fun if you want a good drink and do some people watching.
