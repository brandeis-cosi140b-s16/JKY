This was the first time today that I was at a restaurant surrounded by cocks. And, sadly, this wasn't as stellar an experience as I'd hoped. :( 

Robert M and I went here for breakfast this morning and apparently that's a meal too early to be considered for taking here. The much-zinged about tacos wouldn't be served until 11 a.m. and it was 9:30 a.m. What to do but order a drink. We did; the bloody mary, which is made with house made charred tomatoes, pureed and served with Absolut vodka (can you believe this is their well? For sure!). We both needed to doctor up our drinks, because we like them spicier and I need salt in my everything, yet it was still short of great. Now, had I been wearing my flask belt buckle and thought ahead to fill it with vodka, this might have been a better bloody mary. With the menu limitations in mind, our choices were limited. As we were meeting up with another couple, we didn't want to eat too much and just sit and watch this couple eat, so we ordered the cheese crisp. Or was it crispy cheese? Either way, it's basically cheese toasted on a skillet until it's good and bubbly and crispy, rolled loosely and server. Good, and I'll try to make this at home. Huevos rancheros was my breakfast selection but I'd filled up too much on the crisp, water and bloody mary and wasn't able to finish it myself. Bless my pumpkin's heart, Robert finished for me. 

Apparently the service was off this morning, and it was painfully obvious. From being brought juice glasses for our water (I drink a lot of water and need constant refills) to feeling like we were left to fend for ourselves throughout the meal, something definitely wasn't flowing smoothly. However, I do want to come back and give this place another try. The volume of positive reviews showcase that Gallo Blanco can provide an exceptional dining experience. Until that time, I will have to round up my 2.45 stars to 3 stars. Please, Gallo Blanco. Don't let me down next time.
