Hi- went here with a large group and had a-ok time. My brother had his rehearsal dinner here which was an amazing experience. This time we were here for a birthday. It was a bit odd at the end of the night when we tried to pay. The server ran all of our cards, then asked to run again, then we all ended up with multiple charges on our bills. The management was good about getting it resolved, but it had delayed our leaving by probably at least 20 mins and then we had the hassle the following days. I will go back to give another shot.
