I like this place the food was good for Vegas and the area it is in. And the music is loud but not to loud where u cannot talk to the people u r with. TV's every where so u can which sports. Good seating. Its a great place. Totally would come back if I were back over here. The little waitress w/the black short hair I did not get her name. Love her she was so on top of checking up on us to see if we needed anything. Great girl.
