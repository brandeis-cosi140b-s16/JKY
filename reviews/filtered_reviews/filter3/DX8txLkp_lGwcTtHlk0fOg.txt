Owner is very friendly and seemingly has a remarkable memory for names, he called me by name several times. Nice clean premises, limited seating for perhaps 30 people. Food is served in disposable plates or foil cake pans. Soda is either bottles or cans. Green chili burrito was tasty but scant on beef, only a couple of ounces in mine with lots of sauce ( gravy) I ordered enchilada style per his recommendation but between the sauce and filling was very soupy. I also ordered beans which are also thin which added to the problem. Having only a plastic fork made it difficult to eat. My wife has the same thing except no sauce or beans and thought it was good but very little meat. All in all it was okay but I think I would prefer a place that serves food with dishes and flatware.
