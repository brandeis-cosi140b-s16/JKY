I had heard from friends that the fish tacos here were really good so I thought I'd give it a shot. We went around noon on a Friday and the place was dead. Unfortunately, our server acted like she was slammed even though there were only a couple tables in the whole restaurant. I never got a refill on my drink and I didn't feel like she really cared about our dining experience. The fish tacos themselves were just okay. The fish was good, pretty fishy-tasting like I like, but they needed a sauce of some sort to make them perfect. I found myself really wanting Wahoo's while I was eating there. I've heard the happy hour is pretty good here so I might come back in the future to give it a go.
