I give Mad Mex mad props for a trendy atmosphere, top 40 music, good service, valet, and some creativity in their dishes.

The chimichanga wasn't what I was expecting, but the twist of using some kind of a red sauce and interesting seasoning made the dish worth while.

Why 3 stars?  An incredibly bland quesadilla, lame margaritas, and bleh queso were what made the lasting impression on me.
