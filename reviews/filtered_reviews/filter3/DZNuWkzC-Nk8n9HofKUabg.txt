So I went back here yesterday with my mom to use our credit form the debacle from our last visit, and the staff really made up for the poor experience last time. The manager (Sean I think...) came over more than once to chat and was very apologetic. We ordered the same items this time (the pollo burrito and a cheese crisp with green onions and tomato) and the order was correct on this visit. Our waitress was also very sweet and took extra time with us. They also gave us a fried ice cream on the house, so it was very nice and I appreciate that this restaurant does the right thing when something goes wrong, that is a great quality in a restaurant. So, we have been going for many many years and will probably continue going, especially after this experience. The food is still just the typical Arizona Mexican food place, but at least they care about their customers.
