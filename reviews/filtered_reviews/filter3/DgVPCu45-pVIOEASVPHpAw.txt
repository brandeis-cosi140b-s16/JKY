Was exactly what the 3-star rating says, A-ok.

The carne asada burrito was nothing spectacular but the adobada taco was pretty decent.
The food in general was acceptable and nothing too polarizing but it really doesn't hold up to great Mexican like Don Pepe's back home (just as cheap) or in the Bay area.

Its saving grace may be its cheap price but I'll be looking elsewhere.
