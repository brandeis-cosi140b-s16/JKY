Ok. I had a less than positive predisposition walking in, based on last two restaurants in this space. Not fair, I know.  But...it beat my expectations. the margs were huge (albeit oddly warm when first served...the ice chilled it soon enough). Limited on tap beers, but we found something that works. The chips were stale, salsa was good. The lobster enchiladas (3 of them, the special) were good, as was the lobster quesadilla (with side of guacamole). Portions were large and tasty. The blackbeans served on the side could use a bit more seasoning, but they're not the showcase of the meal anyway. Good neighborhood joint...& this 'hood needs another one! We'll try again!
