The lady bartender didn't smile or say "hello".   She took forever to bring
the appetizer nachos and didn't acknowledge that.  She forgot to give us
silverware and napkins...had to ask for them.  She asked what we wanted to drink but not if we were eating.  It was "HAPPY HOUR" at 
the bar and she wasn't that busy.
