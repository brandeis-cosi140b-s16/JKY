Saw all the reviews and decided to see what it was all about. Walked in and had to wait about 30 minutes. No actual waiting area. Just stood around waiting. We're offered water but never actually received it. Finally sat down then waited for the sporadic service. You can definitely see who the regulars are. They got seated quicker than most and definitely received better service. Sat on a small table close to another table. So the whole time I had to lean forward so I wasn't back to back with a stranger.  Tables were small after their big plates were served. Food was why I gave it 3 stars. Tenderloin egg Benedict's were good. Cooked great. Beans were dry and potatoes were decent. Never received or was offered a refill
On my ice tea. Finished my meal paid and went next door to Luci's to get a drink and dessert. Overall it was ehhh. I more than likely won't be returning. Food was good. Experience wasn't great.
