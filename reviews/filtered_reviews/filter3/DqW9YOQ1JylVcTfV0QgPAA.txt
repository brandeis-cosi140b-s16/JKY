No check in offers. The complimentary chips and salsa are delicious. The killer margarita is the best you can get for $6. Service is a bit slow because they seem under staffed, the bartender was doing everything Literally! I got the enchantment dish. It didn't look like the picture or anyone else picture. The steak was ok the shrimp eh. I plan to revisit and try the stacked enchiladas though.
