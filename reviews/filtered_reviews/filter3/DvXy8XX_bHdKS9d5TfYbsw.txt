Went here for the first time and after reading the reviews I was very excited to try it, but I wasn't very impressed. Burgers are way over priced for just getting a burger and no fries. And the fries are over priced - $2 for a little kids size fry at Mcds is what you get. The French toast fries were dry and not worth it at all. Better off making your own French toast. Also got the burger brûlée . It was pretty good but not worth $7. From looking at the pictures, it looks like they give a decent amount of less fries when you take out too. Probably wouldn't come back here because it is too expensive for their portion sizes.
