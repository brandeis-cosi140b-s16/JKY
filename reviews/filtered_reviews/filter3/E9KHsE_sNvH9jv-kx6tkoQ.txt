Traditional steak tacos are awesome - served with lime, cilantro and onions on a double corn tortilla. Their salsa bar is great too. I'd also recommend their yucca fries with some of their salsa rosada. I've been there for their taco specials - they only do a couple types (including ground beef and chicken), and they are just ok. Their guacamole is just basic. Their drink specials are pretty decent.
