Good food.  They have some interesting and pleasant variations that aren't normally found around here.
The beans and salsa are always excellent.
The Happy Hour is good, but the service in the bar area is really bad (sat in the bar several times and it is always the same....slow, inattentive and sometimes downright rude!).  Also, as is typical in the Phoenix area, they have two light beers, one wheat beer and a dark beer on tap, but no regular beer (you know, a lager or pilsner!).  What is up with that?  So now you have to either order a bottle or go with a soft drink.
All in all, we like the food and go back often.  If the service was better, they would get at least 4 stars and if they had a regular beer on tap, maybe 5!
