The only reason we went here twice was because the first time I forgot my groupon.  I had the tenderloin Caesar wrap. I don't remember what I had the first time. I really didn't care for either dish. The flavors were just not to my liking. I'm more of a comfort food type. My husband had the steak the first time and the enchiladas this time. He wasn't overly impressed with either dish.   I wouldn't go there again.
