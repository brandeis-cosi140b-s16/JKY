Hate how the happy hour ends at 7! But If your a tequila person it is on point! I'm sad to see this place close down just a tad bir! It's going to be El Hefe! Which is a cool kick back bar tequila place replacing it. There's also one in Scottsdale! I usually get the chicken tacos and the must get is the chips and salsa comes with 3 salsas all very good and different on how you like it! The place is very modern indoor and outdoor is nice! Mill avenue feel. The decor and lighting Is also Interesting and the work crew I rate alright it really depends on who serves you to be a good time
