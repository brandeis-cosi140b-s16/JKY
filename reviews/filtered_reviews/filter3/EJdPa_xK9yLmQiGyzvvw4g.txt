Noticed a new Mexican food restaurant close to my house so I figured I'd try it.... Called in my order and was told 10 minutes. Wasn't ready when I came to pick it up and the staff seemed kind of  discombobulated (possibly due to being a new restaurant??) Food was okay, but my glass mexican coke had this awful metallic aftertaste -  throw up in my mouth status... Honestly couldn't even take more than one sip bc it was that disgusting!
