Chilaquiles Verdes were AMAZING - 4.5 for those 

Unfortunately, everything else was sub-par: 
Fish Tacos - 2.5 stars
Veggie Tacos - 3 stars, wanted more veggies, less guac & pico
Chips & Guac - 2 stars

Would maybe come back for the Chilaquiles Verdes, but nothing else.  Guess I was expecting more from this place...(not to mention the female server we had was super rude)
