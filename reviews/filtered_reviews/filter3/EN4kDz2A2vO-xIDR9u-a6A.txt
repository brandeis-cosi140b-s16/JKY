The kids decided this was "Meh-xican" food. I have to agree that it was just OK. Our waitress was nice and attentive, but the food was pretty bland; even the jalape√±os lacked bite.

I'd read other reviews to beware that the salsa here was spicier than at most places -- I've got to say that was definitely NOT my experience. I don't know if they've gotten complaints and default to a mild version for the tourists, but ours was little more than tomato sauce with a few onions in it.

On the plus side, the kids absolutely LOVED their cheese crisps.
