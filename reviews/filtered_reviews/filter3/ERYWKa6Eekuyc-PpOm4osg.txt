Been here for venue events, but otherwise the drinks are a little on the high end (as well as the beers). Can be turned into a dance floor if you are looking to host a large event (the fraternity/UNLV parties are often featured here), so it can host a large amount of people at one time. Nice patio to cool off if you're dancing on the inside. Other than that, the bar service is A-OK.
