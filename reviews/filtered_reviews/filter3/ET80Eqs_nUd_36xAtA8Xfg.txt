I walked into Mango's when I first moved to Arizona.  I met up some friends here who grew up in Arizona and said this place was awesome.  I don't know if it was awesome but I was soooo hungry.  I ordered the killer burrito.  It was actually realllly good but I don't know if I would call it a killer burrito.  I'm from California and when you go to a Mexican place and order something called a 'killer burrito' it usually comes out the length of my arm. Anyhow, Mango's killer burrito was quite small in size but still good...but it was over priced.

Nothing wowed me here and I haven't really found my way back there.  My roommate ordered a quesdilla and she did NOT like it.  I would definitely pass on that. I think it might have been the grease but she said at one point it tasted like chinese food? No thanks.
