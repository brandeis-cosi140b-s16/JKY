Came here last night (Friday) just as a detour of my normal Old Town Scottsdale routine. Got here around 9:30 and was surprised to see how packed it was already with a wide variety of peeps. There are two huge bars, one inside and one outside (although the patio walls were up so everyone got to experience the beautiful night. Tons and tons of TV's everywhere. This place must be really popular for games and got myself curious about watching sporting events here. The music playing was decent, but got better around 11-ish which I also noticed the older patrons leaving and more younger ones entering. I love the fact they take advantage of their drunk patrons by having an outdoor taco grill/stand, you can't resist the delicious smells! The bartenders were super quick with service despite the large crowd and there are tons of super cute security guards working the bar.

 All in all, it was an okay night, I would come back here for happy hour, but not for a weekend night. There is nothing better than having tons of other bars to stumble to when you get bored of the scene, God Bless Old Town.
