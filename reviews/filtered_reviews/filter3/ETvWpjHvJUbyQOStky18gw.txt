I also wanted to write a great review of this place. Especially when they opened the sliding doors and it was such a great night. First of all i remember all too well the old saying "if its too loud, your too old"! Yep, im too old. Perhaps its because its partly a bar but i really don't want to eat with really loud music. I'll drink with really loud music. But i don't want agita! ( thats my old Italian lady word). Off the bat the chips were way salty. That may just be me. Im kind of salt sensitive. I was excited for the tomatillo salsa since its not easy to get. Disappointed, it was bland and had an off taste. My daughter had 2 tacos. One beef, one pork. She downed them both. Preferring the pork. They looked great. I had the tamales with rice and veggies. The rice was bland but i was starving. The veggies standard but tasty. The tamale was extremely tasty and saved the meal for me. Also, the staff was easy going, not rushed and ver accommodating.
