I thought this place was cool. It reminds me of a little California beach side taco joint. I got a chicken bowl with pinto beans, salsa, cheese and pico. I thought it was pretty good. As for the slushie I ordered, I would not recommend it. It was just Torani syrup and crushed ice. Save money and make one at home! Overall, not a bad experience.
