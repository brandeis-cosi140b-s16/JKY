My wife and I had lunch here while waiting for a flight.  I ordered tacos and my wife ordered the steak salad.  I thought it was ok but not great.  The tacos were a little salty and my wife's salad was not impressive at all.  As far as airport food goes, PHX has upped its game in recent years.  Since there are so many options in the A terminal, I would not recommend this place.  Go to Olive&Ivy or LeGran instead.
