I have seen this place a few times and we decided to stop on Friday night.  The d√©cor is comforting and inviting.  I grew up in So Cal and love the vibe.  Yay.  The man at the counter was very nice and helpful.  I ordered nachos and asked him to order me his favorite taco.   Mt partner ordered a bean and cheese burrito with cabbage.  

We sat outside and the weather was fantastic!   We had fun trivia cards on the table and there was plenty to look at to keep us occupied until our order came.

The burrito was very large and my nachos and taco were huge too.  Everything tasted pretty good.  More toward the middle than the great tho.  The raw onions in everything was the most offensive part.  Not sure if we just missed that on the menu or if they just put raw onions on everything.  

Over all, the price was right, the ambiance was nice, the service was great and we had a goodtime.  Was the food amazing?  No, but it was decent.  We will definitely go back and try a few more things and remember to ask them to hold the onions.  

We will be back ;)
