First impression walking in was definitely how clean it was. The food was good and didn't taste like every other Mexican food restaurant out there but had a more authentic taste to it. The drinks were really good too. The service was not the best but it wasn't bad. I recommend trying this restaurant at least once to form your own opinion.
