Dona Maria is in my neighborhood, so we eat here every once in a while (3-4 times per year).  They're known for their Tamales here.  If I was to rate this place just on the Tamales, I'd give them 4 Stars.  However, since they aren't, they only get 3 Stars.  Here's why:

- Their Chips & Salsa is not that great.  The Chips are inconsistent....sometimes they're fresh and taste good, sometimes they're greasy and taste stale.  The Salsa is very weak and bland in my opinion.....no option for Spicy Salsa either.

- Nachos and Beef Fajitas are my entrees of choice here.  Both are just OK, not great.  It fills my tummy, but it doesn't leave me wanting more.

The family enjoys coming here because it's close to home.  If it were up to me, I'd pass on it most days.
