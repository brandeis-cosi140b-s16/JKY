Where else can you celebrate Cinco de Mayo with bands, an ice louge and a bocce tournament? ...no, seriously, where else? Their patio is amazing. 

They have a lighter, more fish-eatin' friendly menu than most of the other Mexican joints in the area. If you've never had it, the fideo is a little like a noodles-from-a-bag dish and I recommend skipping it.

Their salsa is full of flavorful ingredients like black olives, but don't go here looking for fire. You'll have to head elsewhere to bring on the heat.
