The view was great only We didn't go for the view.  We went so my sister whom was visiting could experience some really great Mexican food. My husband and I have on lived in Henderson a few months so I ask where we could some great Mexican food and was told to this restaurant wold be able to fulfill my wish. 
Aside from a huge bill be got the worst Mexican food I ever had. I thought will its just what I ordered but no one liked their meal either. My sister was disappointed and I was embarrass. The chicken was so tough you could thrown it for a frisbee. The salad was very large pieces and it had to be cut and had more of the tough chicken on it. There just wasn't anything we liked and definitely not worth price.
One and done!
