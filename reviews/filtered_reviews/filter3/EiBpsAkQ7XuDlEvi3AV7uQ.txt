My friend and I only ordered drinks and the chips and guacamole. I didn't think the chips or guacamole were that good, and for $12 I was expecting them to be amazing. My margaretta was awesome though so I would definitely order that again.

I absolutely loved the ambiance in this restaurant which is the main reason I want to go back (kind of pathetic, I know). It seems like it would be a really nice restaurant to go on a date. It was crowded at 7:30 on a Tuesday night, so they must be doing something right!
