Had to try this place based on all the positive reviews.  To be honest I love dive restaurants.  Guess I my dive attraction in the military when we used to go to Mexico border towns on weekends,  Loved the food carts and little hole in the walls.  Never need alot of fluff, just good food and prices.  We'll based on everyone's comments I thought I had a winner.  Place is a little hard to find but once inside it is clean and very basic with a few tables in the front room plus additional sitting in the attached dining room   Owner is very friendly and always makes me feel welcome  Been there twice now and the food is flavorful however the prices are creeping up slowly.  At $3.50 for a hot dog is a little high.  Tacos are now $1.50 and the sugar cane coke I think was $2.00.  Since I generally have at least one hot dog and 2-3 tacos (tongue is my favorite) I can rapidly spend $10 for a mid day snack,  I guess I'm going to have to give up the cane coke to stay within my budget,  Fountain pop would be a nice addition but I don't see that happening any time soon.  If the prices were a little lower, I would give the place a 5, but as it is a 3 is all I can give since I can get equally good tacos and hot dogs near Cave Creek and Bell Rd.
