Their food was okay. The issue that I really had was that most of the chicken that's used is dark meat and makes the food taste more different than you think. There's also not very many non-spicy food items on the menu that are edible.

If you want margaritas the size of your head, and extremely greasy and spicy food, Arriba's is the place to go. If you dont drink and are a weenie like I am with spicy food, then this might not be the place for you.
