There are, in my opinion, several types of Mexican food.
One of them is the type that you stop by at 3 in the morning once you are done partying as another bad decision you are going to make that night. This is one of those places.
The food here was very disappointing and I couldn't even finish half of my huarache.

The redeeming point was their horchata, that was pretty good but then again I seem to like the horchata at am/pm so maybe I'm not the best judge of that.
