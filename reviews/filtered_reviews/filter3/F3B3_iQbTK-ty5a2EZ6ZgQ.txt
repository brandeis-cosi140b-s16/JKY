My boyfriend & I arrived in Las Vegas around 12pm. Didn't get to the strip and check into our hotel until 1ish. We were starving since we didn't eat a very big breakfast. So we walked over the luxor/excalibur to explore since we were staying at the mandalay bay. We saw T&T and it sounded pretty good at a decent price. We wanted to get some food in our system before we started drinking. 

They gave you complimentary salsa/chips while ordering food. I got two tacos with rice/beans for $15. Not bad. I think they have some deals going for dinner at this restaurant as well. The food came fairly quickly and I got pretty big portions. I was pretty much full and stuffed by the end of my meal!

The waitress was very friendly and was checking up on our table to make sure if we needed anything.

I'm fan of this restaurant but not the luxor. I'm not quite sure if I'd be back. It's a good place to try but it wasn't enough for me to come back for more.
