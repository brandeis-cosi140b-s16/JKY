Went here last night for dinner (Halloween) - thought it was a cool place.

Sat at the bar and the bar girl was really friendly.

People everywhere celebrating Halloween, so was fun to watch.

Cocktails there were lovely, especially the freshly made pina colada - a definite hit!

My husband ordered the steak burrito and said it was lovely.  Nice big chunks of meat and a good flavour.

I ordered the prawn in lime appetizer as wasn't too hungry.  Prawns were lovely and fresh but the whole dish tasted so strongly of lime I couldn't finish the meal - it was so over powering!  The paella rice was lovely and moist and fresh.

When the bill came it turned out she had given us the main course option of the prawn and rice dish, when I specifically asked for the small appetizer version.  We did wonder why it was so large - but left it as you can never tell with some portion sizes.

I would have rated it higher had it not been for the appalling lime flavoured prawn dish and the bar girl serving and charging us for the wrong size.

I would recommend this place for a drink.
