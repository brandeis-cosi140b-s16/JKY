Visited a friend recently in Tempe and he took me to this place. The service was great, the staff was super friendly and attentive, definitely a lot more polite than I am used to from New York so they get an A on that. Other than that there is nothing special about this place.

The atmosphere is cool. The food was also good, but nothing that really blew my mind. Over all a good experience but probably wouldn't find me going back here even if I lived in the area.
