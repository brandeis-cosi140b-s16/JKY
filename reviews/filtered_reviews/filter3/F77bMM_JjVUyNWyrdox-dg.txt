Tacos Tacos Tacos.
Come to Blanco for Tacos y Tequila!

We came on vacation.  It was walking distance from my hotel. I didn't know, couldn't tell if it was a chain.  But it was hella crowded.  We had to wait 45 min for a table for 4.  Luckily my kids were on good behavior and they gave us chips while we waited.  Also, we ordered margs from the bar.  They were good! Go for au natural with the agave syrup.  So much better than mix.  Much better flavor.  Sort of like a skinny but without the soda water.  YUM.

Once we finally were seated, the service was very pleasant and somewhat quick. the kids both had a kids taco plate.  I had the Mexican chopped  with steak.  The steak was awesome, very good.  Well cooked.  Hubs had the short rib tacos.  He said, there were, "OK."

Also, the place is VERY loud.  I suppose that is what you get when your motto is tacos y tequila, right?  Food 4, ambiance 2, wait 2.
