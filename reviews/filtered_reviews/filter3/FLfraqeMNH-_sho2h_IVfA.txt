The food was great and I would go back for this reason alone.  The service was not good. The waitress was grouchy and we tried to be friendly but she wasn't buying it.  She wasn't accommodating to our friend that was with us, who only wanted carne asada by itself not on a tortilla.  The request shouldn't have been a big deal but the waitress would not offer any alternatives.  I felt like I was bothering her, as if we interrupted her break to order food. 
The burros and salsa were fantastic, if you can deal with the rudeness and long wait then I would recommend this place otherwise order take-out.
