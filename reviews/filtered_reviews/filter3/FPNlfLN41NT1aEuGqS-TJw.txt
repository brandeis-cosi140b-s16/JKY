I've been here twice and the average of the two visits is a 3. The first time was an #evfn event that gave them 1 star for embarrassingly terrible service for my one margarita.

This time I dined there for lunch with a group of 6 and it was a 4! Unbelievable!

Lets just start with the salsa; the lovely, surprisingly dark addictive salsa. I recall at least 4 occasions where I inquired if it was available for take home purchase. Yay once again for non tomato based salsa!

Additionally I had a seafood enchilada that was TO. DIE. FOR. Honestly. It was just the right size for lunch and had salmon, halibut, shrimp, delicious cheese and was made with no tomato as requested. Topped with green Chile it had an amazing flavor that I ended up craving the rest of the day.

Everyone in my group was completely satisfied. Even the meatloaf sandwich lunch special a coworker had looked delicious and I don't even really like meatloaf. 

The service was kinda awkward, for lack of better words, but this completely made me feel better about this place. While it's a little out of the way, I can see it becoming a work lunch spot on occasion... and I won't complain and tell them about my horrid experience from before.
