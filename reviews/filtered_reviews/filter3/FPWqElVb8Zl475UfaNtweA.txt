Let me start by saying this place was veryyyy accommodating...

We came here during the week and it was extremely busy. The wait for a table was about 45 minutes. We found a table in the bar area so ended up sitting there. Everything that we ordered I felt like it was a bit salty. We started off with the tableside guacamole. The good thing about this is it is extremely fresh, they come to your table and make it right in front of you! It was good but a bit salty. I ordered the Tecate Skirt Steak. The steak was very tender but also a bit salty. & you get 3 mini tacos. They're really little. My friend is a vegetarian so she ordered the Grilled Portobello Mushroom which she didn't enjoy because it was also salty. The waitress asked how everything was and recommended the Corn Gorditas instead, took her plate and brought her the new dish. =) 

For drinks, I got the Missionary which is a mix of the red sangria and the mission margarita. Yummy in my tummy! lol. My friend got the 360ยบ Mint Lemonade which she loved. 

I loved the ambience of the place and the customer service was amazing however I thought that the entrees were a bit over priced for some bite size tacos...
