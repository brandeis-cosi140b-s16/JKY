Had lunch here with the hubby. Was a little worried because of some of the reviews that I had seen, but thought what the heck, let's try it. I had chicken fajitas and hubby had chicken and steak fajitas. Both were delicious. Came out sizzling and stayed hot through the whole meal :-). The steak was tender and had very good flavor. Chips were yummy as was the tea. There were only 2 girls waiting on the whole dining room so service was a bit slow, so be prepared for that. We will be back to try them again and will try some other things.
