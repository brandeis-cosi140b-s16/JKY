Cute upscale cafe but the food didn't seem worth the price.  My friends and I went as part of the Dining Out for Life fundraising day because Barrio was donating 100% of its proceeds to fighting AIDS.  Maybe it was because we went on that day, but it seemed that service was sorely lacking and the food was dry.  

I had the Tacos de Cochinita Pibil which was tasty except the pulled pork was dry.  My friend got the Pollo Poblano which was also dry.  We got the pomegranate guacamole which was EXCELLENT and probably the only redeeming thing about our meal that day.
