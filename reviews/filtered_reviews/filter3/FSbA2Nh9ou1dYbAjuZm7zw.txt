This place is very run down and not clean at all. The food was ok I had their chile verde burrito and ive had way better in other places. I also ordered pozole and I swear it was the most bland pozole in the world. The only thing that came out good was the eggs with bacon and string fries that my daughter ordered she loved them. One last thing is that the cashier that was there in the morning was a sweetheart she put a big smile on my daughters face lol....
