Came here with a big work group. The Spotted Donkey offers solid Tex-Mex that seems more Tex than Mex in a great casual setting. Can't beat the location if you're staying at the Boulders. 

Portions here are humungous and I could barely make a dent in my entree after some appetizer rounds. 

I tried:
- ceviche: well done, perfect mix of saltiness and not too much 'filler' veggies
- jalapeño poppers - breaking was a little burnt. I liked the presentation in a shot glass and the fact that fresh jalapeño was used
- tacos - I got the chicken tacos because it was one of the few items not fried and/or smothered in cheese. This was a solid choice, but I didn't like that it was dark meat vs chicken breast

Drinks and service were a highlight. Special props for making me a Paloma (like a margarita but better) without my having to explain the ingredients.
