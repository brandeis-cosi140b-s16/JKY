The food here is always good classic Sonoran fair with a little bit more heat using the New Mexico Hatch chilis then standard Sonora style restaurants in the valley. The rice and beans are pretty classic there are no surprises and no disappointments the service is about the same, nothing great but not disappointing either and prices are reasonable.
