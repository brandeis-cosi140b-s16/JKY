Went to Joy Ride today and was disappointed. The service was wonderful and attentive but the ceviche did not really have much shrimp and the tacos were light in filling. The ceviche had maybe 2 shrimp for 12.5 not a great value. However, the shrimp that we did try was seasoned well and tasted great. The carne asada taco again, great flavor little meat. I began to wonder today with the lunch specials that they offer are they skimping other places? Bummer... Joy ride is one of my favorites places to go. I love the funky atmosphere and food but it not really living up to my experiences there. I hope that in the future they get back to where they used to be fusing all aspects of dining: great atmosphere, great tasting food and providing a great to good value.
