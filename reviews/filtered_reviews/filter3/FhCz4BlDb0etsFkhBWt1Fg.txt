A very strong 3.49

I started to wonder why they were almost as many cars here as Jack in the Box and Burger King in the same neighborhood at lunch time.  So last week I stopped in.  It wasn't real busy when I got there at 11 but things were going strong by the time I left.  I decided on Asada because I saw it being grilled.  I got the plate which came with beans and your choice of tortillas ($6.00).  I also got a large Horchata.  Very well flavored meat but a bit on the chewy side which seems to be the norm for grilled Asada.  The beans had something in them which gave them an orange tint and was quite tasty.  The salsa bar was pretty complete but I wish the three different red salsas had labels so I could get the mild one with out having to get a cup of all three to figure it out.  I imagine their tacos, burritos, and quesadillas are all just as good as my meal was.  Contrary to the average Mexican fast food place this one had a fairly small menu and was nicer inside.  There is also a good sized patio.
