Went to dinner with some friends and was unsure about this place.  it was kinda dark and the wall by our table was hand carved skulls and skeletons all over it.  The steak i ordered was cooked perfect.  It came with a side of guacamole and black beans, and had a pepper sticking out that looked like Asparagus so i ate it in one shot not realize it was the hottest pepper i've ever eaten in my life!!!!
