This was the fourth and last time I will try this place, I keep thinking it's going to get better and it doesn't, the service isn't attentive and doesn't get orders correctly, the guacamole is more of a guacamole paste in a bowl! I like fresh guacamole! made at your table made to order! I'm not looking to slam them, by no means, I'm sure there's people out there that enjoy it,  but I rather go to Roberto's.
