Food: Good but most entrees are spicy. Also not too many choices for vegetarians... Prices aren't too bad.

Setting: The decor's tacky to the nth degree. Chandeliers made from beer bottles, plastic vegetables hanging down from the ceiling etc. The place looks like a junk yard... Also they had some mist/water coming down in their outside seating area. Ladies, if you straighten your hair, don't come here...

Service: Seemed slow for most tables but I did tell the waiter to hurry it up. He brought the food in 9 mins... Yes I timed him. :)
