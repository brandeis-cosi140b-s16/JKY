3 cheers for happy hour pricing on beers! 

Like many others have said, this restaurant is set up like a fancy Tacos el Gordo. Except the patrons and ambiance are a lot more wannabe hipster and lot less Mexican. 

The food is good. Flavorful, if a little bit on the saucy / soggy side. The Mexican street corn is really delicious and they really don't skimp on the meat and cheese on the carne asada fries. 

My main dislike is how freaking loud it is in here. During happy hour they have a live DJ, which is fine because it's like, "whoo party tiiime," but even during regular hours they BLAST the club music. It is unnecessary for the music to be so loud, and it distracts from the food and conversation. 

My second dislike is sort of related to the set up. I understand they're trying to do it like tacos el gordo with separate meat stations, and that works only if they move FAST and at similar speeds. However, the burrito / fish & shrimp taco / fries, nachos & corn station is significantly slower than the meat stations. That means that if you want carne asada fries AND an al pastor taco, even if you order the fries first, go order the al pastor taco, and come back for the fries, by the time the fries come out your taco is cold. Even if you order carne asada fries and a shrimp taco (same station), they come out so far apart from each other that one is inevitably cold and soggy by the time the other comes out. So the only way to have all hot items is to order only meat items and no sides.

Update:
They are obsessed with the vampiro right now. My friend ordered an al pastor taco, out came a vampiro. I ordered 1 pibil taco and 1 chicharron taco, out came 1 taco and 1 vampiro....
