Loco Patron is great for what it is - a place to get drunk for cheap, and snack on what I like to call "bar Mexican food". There are a handful of places in very close proximity to Loco that also offer similarly priced "bar Mexican food", but I choose Loco every time over Salty's or Dos or San Felipe's. 

I have drank here many times, eaten here many times, and overall I generally really like this bar. They've got a nice smoking patio with effective misters -- seriously where else do you see people on the patio in 110+ degree Arizona heat in summer besides Loco?

They've got a pretty good happy hour that goes until 7pm, offering lots of discounts on drinks. I'm pretty sure some or most of their appetizers are discounted during HH too, which is a plus for me. 

The mahi mahi tacos are probably my favorite menu item. For $13 you get two pretty decent sized tacos on your choice of corn or flour tortillas filled with delicious grilled mahi mahi, pico, an avocado cream sauce, and caramelized onions. Yum. Oh, and your choice of two sides, but who gets anything besides rice and beans at a place like this anyway?

My least favorite thing about this bar is hands down their salsa. In my opinion, it doesn't have enough spice/kick to it, and tastes and looks very watered down. But they do offer several flavors of Cholula and Tobasco, so all is not lost ;-)
