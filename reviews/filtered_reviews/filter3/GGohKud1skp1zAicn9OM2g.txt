I ate here once and swore never to come back but since it was my friend's birthday and this was where he wanted, this was where we went.

We decided to do reverse Happy Hour and none of us came early to get tables to the 10 of us waited a fair amount of time to pull 3 tables together. 

The food was just okay, nothing special or anything. My friend ordered almost every dish that didnt contain meat off the HH menu. Food came out pretty fast. Just everything seem to contain guacamole and chips. 

Service was not that great. They seem to never be around and they messed up on our checks several times, and took them forever to fix.
