$3.95 breakfast right next to our hotel?! Yes, please!  Two eggs, choice of meat, American fries and tortolla(or toast) and 99 cent margaritas to boot!  Great price for the strip...eggs were fresh and delicious.

We probably won't go here for any other meals.  The decor reminds me of a low budget se√±or frogs and there's a dj booth...which doesn't float my boat.  

Service was fast and friendly.  He even remembered our order the second day we went in!
