We came here with the local recommendation of our hotel concierge. Good place to get tequila with delicious tacos, he said. We came during lunch on Saturday so no happy hour and no drinks to vouch for. 

We ordered the Pollo Asada Burrito and Tres Tacos combo. The burrito was good, not spectacular in the marinade. They kinda went light on the cheese and guac, but the black beans were delicious. For the tacos- we ordered Lobster, Mahi mahi, and shrimp. The shrimp tacos were my favorite. Extremely flavorful, and cooked perfectly. This place can add a little more lobster to the taco, and the mahi mahi was okay.

The service was quick and all the ladies were very nice. Food was mediocre though.
