Again, I'm giving credit where credit it due.

While I'm still not thrilled with the visit to Cantina Laredo Saturday night, I have to give kudos to Dave the manager (long time with the chain) for calling and following up. He showed a REAL concern for any problems that guests might have and wanted to make it right and will follow up on my complaints.

Caring about customers is more than half the battle in retaining people who spend their hard earned money with you. Thanks for the follow up and we'll see how things go should I visit again...which I might.
