The place inside seems a little dirty. 
Our table was sticky so we moved to the outside patio. The patio was really nice. They had the tower heaters which was perfect cause it was getting a bit cold at night. The waitress & staff were really helpful & polite. The chips & salsa were just ok. The music was awesome! We had the cactus pear Jumbo Margarita (on the rocks) which was recommended to me by the waitress. It was no bueno. The taste was no different than any other margarita you could find in a bottle at 7-11. All you could taste was the syrup, which left us wondering if they put any liquor in the $20 drink. 
Overall I wouldn't go for the margaritas but maybe try a different drink.
