Don't go here to eat. Great place for drinking, especially on the back patio, but don't go here to eat. Especially not for brunch! You read online that they have a chorizo scramble but apparently the new chef has changed things up a lot. They only offer small, small tacos for brunch! Very limited selection. And they're served to you on Chinese plates. Very weird. Friendly and attentive wait staff though. I'd say, go here for drinks only. Thankfully they just got their liquor license back.
