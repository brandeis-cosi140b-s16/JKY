As a Scottsdale transplant living in Chandler,  I'm always looking for a "cool" and "hip" place to go for happy hour.  Normally, the boys pick places like Majerle's and Murphy's Law.  Boorrrring.  

Now, I don't really like Sandbar Scottsdale.  Too......"alternative", with lots of punk rockers.  But anyway.

We arrived around 4:30pm for happy hour, and there was already a good sized crowd there.  When we sat down with several others, it was clear the waitress was terribly slow with zero personality.  And what's up with the black knee socks with the sculls?  It continued to get busy, and the crowd was the most random group ever.  I saw 21 year olds, parents with children in tow, hot MILF's, and old dorky men straight from Intel.  I'm thinking it's because it's new and everyone wants to check out that cool bar with the real sand and mini pool.

I would have gone with 2 stars, but I threw an extra in because they're new and I will check it out on a Saturday night around 9pm to see if we can weed out some of the randoms and get a fun crowd having a good time!  

Who am I kidding?  We just talk amongst ourselves anyway!
