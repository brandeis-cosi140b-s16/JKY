You are paying for the location here.  Patio - adorable.  But the whole restaurant is understaffed and the food is WAY overpriced.  It is a funky atmosphere with a cool upstairs hangout.  We had the 'nothing is in here' tacos and margaritas.  The margaritas were very strong yay!  Made up for the crappy food and crappy service.  Ya will only drink here in the future....Loco Lime for better and more reasonably priced Mexican!!
