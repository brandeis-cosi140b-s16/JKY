Visited Charlotte for a weekend and was recommended to this place a couple different times. Amidst a really fun and hip neighborhood is this towering cantina. It's like a portal to a seafood shack somewhere in a beach town. 

Once seated, you are greeted with chips and what I think is homemade salsa. It was great! Definitely a different take from your typical restaurant salsa that is runny. 

But, I didn't come here for salsa. I came for the fish tacos - they did not disappoint. I had both the battered shrimp and fish, both were so delicious. I ended up asking for lime to complement the tacos, which was definitely the right decision.

I would definitely visit this joint again, it was a great spot in a really fun neighborhood.
