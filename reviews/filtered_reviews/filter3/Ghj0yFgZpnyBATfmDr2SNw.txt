I was looking forward to a meal at Tacos Atoyac after reaing such great reviews.  I have to say that I was not overly impressed with the food.  The tacos were okay but not as great as I was led to believe with such glowing reviews.  We tried a variety from the fish to the lengua.  Actually the lengua was yummy but the rest we tried were just ok.  The service was good and the restaurant appeared clean.  The AC was on the wimpy side.
