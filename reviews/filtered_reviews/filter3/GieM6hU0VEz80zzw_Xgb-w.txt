Even though the name of this restaurant has mucho in their name, there is nothing mucho about their tacos. The lady who was cashiering told me they were "a little bit bigger than street tacos" which was a lie. They charge $2.95 PER TACO when they should be charging $1.95 because of the quality and size. Not worth it. We got the Baja fish which was pretty decent and had a little heat (which I guess made up for their very mild salsa bar AKA not one salsa was hot period) and the Pollo Asado which was just ok. Their pico de gallo brought in the most flavor with the chicken being bland. We also got a carne asada burrito and split that and the 2 tacos (because we didn't want to pay another $2.95 for another "not a street taco" taco). The meat on the burrito was overcooked and the cook did not cut it apart meaning as I was chewing and swallowing it, pieces would still be stuck in the part that I was still chewing and I would gag. Personally, I say take your money to Joyride Taco House. Their tacos are twice the size for around the same price and their food is 1,000 times better than this place could ever hope to be.
