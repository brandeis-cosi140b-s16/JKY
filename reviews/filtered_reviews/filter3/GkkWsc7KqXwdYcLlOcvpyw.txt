Went with my son during a rainy Super Bowl afternoon.  Due to the inclement weather it was pretty dead.

The best part were the chips and salsa and margaritas.  Ordered table side home made guacamole which was very tasty.  

Disappointed with the tacos.  Tacos??? Really, lol.

Fajitas were just, "ok".

In my opinion, a great place to go to for margaritas and chips and salsa and that's it.
