I went for lunch last week and got a taco salad - it was nothing to write home about. The portion was fine, but there we no beans (not refried or black) and the lettuce was a little on the brown side.

The best part about this place is they offer you 2 different kinds of salsa with you meal - a smokey, chunky salsa and then a medium, pureed kind. Both we very good, and I found the chunky salsa super addicting. 

Don't go during lunch without expecting a 15 minute wait. A little noisy, but a good little spot.
