So I'll make this short and sweet. I've been to Gallo many times. The food is always good and the drinks even better. Tonight I went in hoping to have the great experience I usually have yet that wasn't the case. It was a pretty slow night in comparison to previous visits so I expected the service to be great. That wasn't the case our server was very spaced. He took forever to take our order, and once he did failed to execute it correctly, now I realize mistakes our made but try to get it right the second time for godsakes. Once getting the bill the mistakes where still on there which is ridiculous and a unconvincing prompt "sorry" was given. Me and my family go here at least twice a month and sadly this experience will prompt us to reconsider.
