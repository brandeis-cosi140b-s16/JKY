Chain chain, go away, come again another day. 
Chain chain, go away, come again another day. 

Ok so, as far as chains go, this place is OKAY. Eh, yeah...okay. I've definitely had better. The salsa and chips they give you in the beginning are good. And that's a star right there. Free salsa and chips that are tasty are extremely important. Yum. 

But then here comes the food. I got some kind of chicken fajita (FA JIYE-TA?!) that didn't have much flavor or zest to it despite being grilled chicken in onions. Try burger king style chicken among some chopped tomatoes and terrible guacamole. NO! NO! SAVE ME! 

Granted, the stuff my sister got, the chicken enchiladas, were much better than what I ordered. That's either a signal that you shouldn't order from the healthy side of the menu (which I did) or you should have the taste buds of my sister. That's your choice. 

Dessert was a saving grace, some kind of caramel chocolate empanadas with ice cream that really made the meal better. Well, it at least made me forget what I ate, until now.
