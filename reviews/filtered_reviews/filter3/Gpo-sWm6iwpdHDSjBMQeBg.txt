Today I walked into Rito's with high hopes because of the great reviews unfortunately for them those high hopes came with high expectations. Those expectations were not met,  don't get me wrong the food wasn't bad it was average to slightly above average. I feel as though if you grew up on their enchilada sauce you would think it was the best around, but from an outsider's perspective I didn't see what all the fuss was about. 

Worth stopping at if you happen to be in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there. 

On a better note I almost gave Rito's a 4 star rating because the staff was so friendly and nice. 

With so much high quality Mexican food in the Southwest United States this is a can miss restaurant, very nice people and I wish them the best.
