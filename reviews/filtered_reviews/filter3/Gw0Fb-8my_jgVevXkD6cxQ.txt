Craving Mexican(ish) food we decided on Las Velas in Market Square since we wanted to try something besides Chipotle or Moe's (which can both be found next door).

Food: Obviously Americanized, but I was surprised to find Tamales were the Special that night. They were mediocre, as were the Carnitas Tacos and our Guacamole, but portions were large and fairly priced.

Ambiance: SO LOUD. They had a Mariachi band making rounds and "serenading" all the tables, which could be fun if you're out with friends, but in my case I secretly wished they would stop playing so I could enjoy my dinner conversation without having to yell over the music.

Bonus: There was a foursquare special of $10 off $10 when using an AmEx card, but none of the waiters seemed to have a clue when I showed it to them. In the end, they just took $10 off the bill!

Overall: Seems like a happening spot for Happy Hour, but I probably should have just went to Chipotle or Moe's.
