I wasn't sure how to feel about El Hefe coming to Mill ave since I really liked Canteen
But it is nice and the layout is still the same, I like the pink scheme
Courtney is an absolute doll behind the bar
If you have the chance, ask for her
and she will take care of you

El Hefe has a great happy hour
The house margs are only $5
The also have drafts pretty cheap as well

I shall return and hopefully try the food
