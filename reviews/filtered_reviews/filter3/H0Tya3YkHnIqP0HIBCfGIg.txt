This place used to be great, now it is just ok.

The bean dip and spicy salsa is still here, as are the Margaritas and beer but something is just missing.

The spicy salsa is just not as bold or full of flavor.

The dishes seem tired and over done.

My chili rellno was good but a bit stringy and hard to cut.

The spinach enchiladas could have used a bit more spinach in them. 

Over all still decent but for the prices I would rather go hit up another place.
