mediocre- not amazing but not horrible! i actually didn't want to write a review to be totally honest but i checked in here and yelp wouldn't quit telling me to write a review. i finally caved just to remove the annoying reminder. you win, yelp, you win. 

i've only been twice. not a fan of the carne asada but the chorizo, shredded pork and blakcened chicken is Ok. The price is fair and the people working have been super friendly both times.
