I happen to like this place & before our office moved it used to be across the street, now it's a downtown adventure which I still like because I always discover new things. It's a casual place with lots of beautiful Freda art and it always seems to be busy. 
I am always on the hunt for great Mexican restaurants in Vegas & this one I would describe as filling & casual. Not the greatest but nowhere near the blandest either. It's cheap & comforting. The staff isn't my favorite so try to get a groupon before you come to get the best discount out there.
