My friend and I stopped in here after a day of shopping and it was nearby.  The reviews on  yelp made us stop by.

The three stars are really based on the quality of the food and the location of the restaurant to me.  

The food quality was good, but didn't knock my socks off.  I can get just as good tacos elsewhere in the valley.
- Two taco plate ($9) - had two different kind of tacos, with two tortillas per taco type, rice and beans.  I had the smoked marlin, which I tasted more of the salsa than the marlin...  and the Sonoran carne asada tacos which were yummy but I've had better elsewhere.
- I also wanted to try the el pastor street tacos ($3 for two tortillas).  They were yummy but sadly I had Rocky Point on the top of my mind and I remember getting better there.... 
-My friend got a chicken deep friend quesas that had peppers and onions in it.  It was very yummy and a large portion but very rich.

The restaurant was cute, but small.  Luckily it was just the two of us because a large group would be too much.
The menu was extensive, it was hard to make a decision.
There were tons of salsas to try and a free basket of chips when we sat down, so it was fun to try all the different salsas.

The wait staff was friendly and attentive, I really did like my lunch there but I wouldn't call myself a "fan".  It was good though, and if I happen to be in the area (which is very rare) I would stop in.
