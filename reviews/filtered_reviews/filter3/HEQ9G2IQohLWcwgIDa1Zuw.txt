Went here with a big group for dinner and drinks.  Had what they call the "best margarita"--you should get that; they are very good & HUGE!  The chips are great (especially the ones that come with sweet potato chips mixed in).  The guac was okay.  And the blackened fish tacos, while huge, were okay.  I'd say that I agree with most other reviews about the food; not bad, but nothing amazing.
