I LOVE Chipotle, I eat there at least 3 and sometimes 5 days a week but this particular location is extremely chincy, I always ask for extra cheese and the lady giving the cheese always gives me an attitude, she puts a couple extra sprinkles on and then hurrys and closes the lid and pushes it on without even looking at me. Pisses me off to no end. It's to the point now that it's not about the cheese its about an attitude of piss poor customer service, from now on I'll drive to the next nearest location. I travel around the valley for work and have been to at least 7 different locations and this is the only only place I get this poor customer service. Cheese is the only topping I get on my bowl so I don't think it unrealistic to ask for some extra cheese. Most locations load it on and make jokes about it being a "cheese bowl" instead of a chicken bowl. It's only this particular location and particularly the cheese lady that has a piss poor customer service attitude. This has been going on for weeks and weeks now so I finally decided to write a review. I might try this place one more time just to see if a review like this will actually change anything but otherwise I'll drive to the next closest location where I know I'll get decent customer service.
