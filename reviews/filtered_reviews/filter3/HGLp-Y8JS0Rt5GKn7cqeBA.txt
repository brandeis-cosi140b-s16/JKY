I saw the high ratings and decided to give this place a try.  I ordered the Taco Tuesday special, 3 tacos, rice, beans, and cheese.  It came out on a big plate.  The portions looked huge and generous.  Upon closer inspection, it was the rice and beans that were generous.  The tacos themselves were pretty small and tasted like tacos you'd normally get at a decent taco stand for half the price.  The rice was nice and fluffy.  It tasted fresh.  I'm from Houston, Texas, and used to the excellent Mexican food there.  This place misses the mark in comparison.

Shortly after eating here, I did not feel very good.  After 4 hours I felt pretty bad and had to go to bed early.  I tossed and turned a lot.  The next morning went to the bathroom and had diarrhea.  Okay, so I am not coming back.  A little bit overpriced and food poisoning is not healthy.
