Just got back from the first time there, on Cinco De Mayo. As you will see in several reviews, the decor of the room is not much. It comes off mostly like a banquet or meeting room that had some light conversions to make it a restaurant. Anyway-the food. They had a couple of special going-shrimp tacos or carne asada steak and chees enchilada. The enchilada was not good. Dry, no sauce, not much flavor. The carne asada however, was about as good as I could imagine--lot's of good flavor. My wife had the shrimp tacos and kind of gave them an 'ehhh'. Overall, three stars for me. A sign of a great restaurant for me is ---would I pass by like restaurants to go to this one'. For me, the anwer is no.
