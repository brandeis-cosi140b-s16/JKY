I went to Poncho's today for lunch with the BF and it was ok. The place was very busy, so I thought that was a good sign. We waited for a bit before being seated in one of the small rooms in the back. We were given chips and the salsa in the bowl and promised salsa in a bottle. The chips were very greasy and not that crunchy and the salsa tasted like very peppery ketchup...ick. After 5 minutes or so we were given the squeeze bottle which contained a very similar, but slightly less tomato -y, salsa...not a win. For lunch, I had the mini pollo fundido and the BF had a taco and tostada. My food was alright, the chicken on the inside of the burro was nothing special, but the sauce was good and the rice was really good. Sort of what I expect from a cheap Americanized Mexican restaurant. The BF's taco was fine....also nothing special, but not bad. The prices were decent and the portion sizes were too large. I think it's super funny that they are clinging to the fact that Bill Clinton ate here 15 years ago or so, they have the newspaper clippings all over....I definitely lol'd. Anyway, I wouldn't avoid this place, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.
