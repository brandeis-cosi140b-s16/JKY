We were in Phoenix & Mesa on business a little bit back and only had time for one sit-down meal. This is the place our hotel suggested. The rest of the group really liked their food (or at least pretended to...I don't know), but I thought my blue seafood enchiladas were kind of dry. It just kind of fell beneath my expectations. And the pineapple juice was sooooooo sweet. In a bad way.
