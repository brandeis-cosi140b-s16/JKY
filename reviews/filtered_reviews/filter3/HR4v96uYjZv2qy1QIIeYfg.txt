They need more waiters to run this restaurant. We waited for about half hour and they sat us along the railing- which we didn't mind because it was a beautiful view but as soon as we got in, there were tons of empty seats (about 10 seats along the railing and a few empty tables??!!!) Our waiter, Alicia was friendly. The chopped salad I ordered was just alright- not the best..
