My family and I have been coming to this place for years... back when it was called 'Crystal Palace'.

We still go regularly, mostly for my dad's or mom's b-day celebration.. or with my in-laws.  One thing I've noticed throughout the years about this establishment is that they have the same waiters ... I'm talking working there for at least the 15-20 years that we've been going to this place.  That is kind of impressive, you know.

So, what to order?  Well, if your idea of a Sunday afternoon (when we usually go) is to have a nice lunch and then have a functional, productive afternoon... don't eat here!  It doesn't really matter what you order.  99% of the time what you will be served is an elliptical plate with a 24" major diameter that is chock full of greasyass refried beans, brown (aka Mexican) rice, and some other main dish that is covered in creamy salsa, cheese, or both!  

I'm not saying it's bad (yes, it's bad for you) tasting, because it is actually quite tasty.. but, you 100% of the time regret ordering these dishes because of how you feel afterwards.  You're just bound to feel like a pig... heck, just wear your stretchy pants and one of those puffy blouses (gals, they are in style now) that way you can hide the bulge that will be your bloated belly.  Sigh... this is why I just get the fajitas these days...

The staff is mostly Spanish speaking (fine with me) and so are the patrons of the restaurant.  You'll pay a nominal price, be surrounded by lots of Mexicans, hear some typical Mexican music (hey, maybe you'll get a song from the mariachis that stalk the tables), and eat like a pi... person that has been starved and has finally been fed.
