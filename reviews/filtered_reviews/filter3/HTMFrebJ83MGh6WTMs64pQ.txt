Loved the food....and loved the service.  Was floored be the small portions & price.  Tiny tacos were $5 each and a small plate of fish nibbles on a bed of crispy noodles was $48!  Drinks were $15 each.  Again, yummy, but very very overpriced.  My guy and I spent nearly $150 for shared meal and needed to get fast food for diner later.  Sad.  If you want mini, yummy, meals....and money is no object....this is the place.
I recommend you try the salty foam Margaritas.  Again, yummy, and tiny.
