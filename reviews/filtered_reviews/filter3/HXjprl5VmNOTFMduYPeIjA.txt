This place is very college - which is fitting for the setting. Tempe Market Place is the perfect backdrop. This place was started by a couple of locals who were inspired by their spring break trips to Rocky Point - which explains the ambiance. If that's what you're into, then go for it. 

It's very similar to other rocky point inspired bars around town. It's tacky and colorful and loud and all hard surfaces that are all very easy to clean puke off of. 

Speaking of puke... this place does have a wide selection of tequila (not that I care) but very mediocre margaritas... shame. Other standards food-wise are sub-par or average... a pair of small steak tacos was 8 bucks and tasted like the two for a buck you would pick up in Rocky Point. Nothing special. The cheese crisp was too loaded with cheese (for my taste). Their salsa was boring and their chips were dry and tasteless. 

On the other hand - the Chicken Caesar Salad was totally brilliant. It's not like the most difficult thing to make or anything, but the ingredients they used made for fantastic eats. mmmm... 

I didn't like having to show ID at the door (to some kid 10 years younger than me) so I could go EAT AT THEIR RESTAURANT. I guess there must be liability risks if they let younger patrons in - however, I did see a 3 year old there... I asked if she had been carded as well.

Food-wise - go eat at Chipotle if you want mexican cuisine. If you want to drink a lot of tequilla and listen to music on the outdoor patio with your college buddies - happy hour prices are great and this place might just hit the spot.
