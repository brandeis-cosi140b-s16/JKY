This is a tough one because we went with friends and it was highly recommended.  I am also basing this off one visit.

I give the atmosphere and food a solid 4 stars.  The food isn't authentic Mexican or even Tex Mex, but a great fusion.  They do a very nice job with the flavors.  We found the staff to be pleasant and service good, but it was a little slow.

The parking is awful (Although we got lucky finding a spot).  If you are going to have no parking, offer valet. I found the drinks to be very blahhh.  The prices are a little on the high side.  

I would definitely try it and decide for yourself and I may very well visit again and update this review.
