The atmosphere of this restaurant is pretty neat.  Customer service is great.  You order up front and they bring your food to your table.  However, I expected a lot more out of the tacos.  I ordered a chicken taco and a shrimp taco.  Out of the two, the shrimp one was better... but there was nothing absolutely amazing about it.
