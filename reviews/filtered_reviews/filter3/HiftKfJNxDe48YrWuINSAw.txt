Hmmm... what can I say about this place?  It's ambiance is equivalent to a little dive bar.  You walk in, and order to the left, take a number then go and sit to the right sitting area which seemed a little ghetto and self serve plastic knives, forks, etc.

We asked for suggestions when ordering and got the Jerk chicken fried rice, with Chile relleno and Jade Red Chicken.  The lady behind the counter asked for my name and couldn't spell it (my name is Teresa... like Mother Teresa.  It's not that hard!).  Was surprised, but whatever.

Food: The Chili relleno was AWESOME!!!  It was breaded with Cheese-its!!  Not greasy, but the breading was a bit thick, that I ended up having to cut away half of the bread per bite cause it was too much.  The Jerk Chicken Fried rice was ok; regular fried rice with jerk chicken in it.  Lastly, the Jade Red Chicken was just like the greasy, fried Orange chicken of Panda Express.

Overall, the experience was interesting, food was ok.  The only 'WOW' factor was the pairing... cheese-it chili relleno with fried rice.  If I'm in the area, I would probably stop by for the chili relleno, but I wouldn't make a special trip just for their food.
