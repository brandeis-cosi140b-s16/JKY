I am giving 4 stars, but I am a little skeptical about this restaurants staying power. I know it just celebrated it's 1 year anniversary, but there is something suspect about this place. 

I had dinner here with my family for my brother's 28th birthday. The interior is very warm and dark. There appeared to be a nice bar area and the dining area was nice and open. I did like the way they presented the menus. They had this leather bound cover and it fit very well with the decor. 

We started with a table side guacamole. It was good. The guy that prepared it gave us a play by play and had very infomercial type voice. A little annoying. I almost felt bad for him. The portion wasn't very big however. The chips and salsa were good, but when is that bad. The selection on the menu is quite small and if you are vegetarian there are no options. I had the swordfish with a shrimp ceviche and rice. It was actually very good, but the portion was small by eating out standards. I actuality it was probably the perfect amount of food. The pork and chorizo was a hit at the table as well. I was also able to try the scallops. They were good, but a tad undercooked. 

Here is what makes me worry about their staying power. The server to diner ratio was probably 2:1. We must have had at least 7 different people help out our table. We noticed a lot of other servers, runners, bussers, hostesses, and managers milling about. How can they afford to pay all of these people? Oh yeah, the food is on the expensive side. 

It was good, but I won't be rushing back there.
