The Burrito company has your standard Mexican fare. Although good, nothing really stands out as exceptional. The style is Sonoran.

I ordered my favorite burrito, a carne asada. The burrito was a nice size and overall pretty good. Some of the meat was a bit chewy. One thing I wasn't a fan of was the pico being all on the bottom third of the burrito and not spread evenly throughout the burrito. Along with the burrito, I added the combo of rice and beans. The rice and beans I received seemed to be a bit small.

Based on reviews, the breakfast burritos are the the real winner here. I plan to go back and put this to the test. 

I'm still searching for burritos that equal that of the Bay Area in the Phoenix area. Although the Burrito Company has good burritos, they still fall short of the standard I've had in California, but equal to what I'm used to in Phoenix.

Overall 3.5 stars if I could.
