I didn't visit Yelp before visiting Sonrisa because we had not planned on eating there, just wanted to bring some friends who had never been to Lake Las Vegas and we decided to get a drink which turned into ordering food.

The food was pretty good but the service was lousy.  We had no utensils or napkins on our table, the server wasn't very attentive.   We ordered drinks and an appetizer sampler plate.  When the food came we asked the server for napkins and utensils.  When she had not returned in a few minutes we asked the bus boy and he brought them over.  The server then arrived with white paper napkins instead of the cloth ones. 

It wasn't very busy yet she was still very slow and when I paid the bill she did not bring my credit card back.   No tip for her.  

I'll probably return when I visit Lake Las Vegas since the food and drinks were pretty good but they really need to improve their service.
