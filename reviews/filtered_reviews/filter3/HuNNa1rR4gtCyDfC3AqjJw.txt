I was invited to Modern Margarita via their Facebook for one of their first nights. I enjoyed the food but was a little disappointed with the drinks. 

When I asked to change the tequila to something a little "higher shelf" they were unable to do it. They pre-mixed everything instead of making items fresh. I am hoping that as they get through the initial opening, they are able to help customers out with requests like these. 

Overall the service was good, the atmosphere was nice. It feels very much like a new "trendy hot spot" where often people are looking to see and be seen. 

If I have a group of girlfriends looking for a night out, this place will now be on the list.
