Went for a small dinner a week ago. Had the ceviche and a few tacos. Sat on the patio on a beautiful night, and glad we did. They had flamenco dancers and live music inside which is cool but way to loud for a restaurant setting. So the server forgot to put in our order then tried to BS me when I asked about it. But to his credit they comped the tacos. Ceviche was pretty good. Plenty of shrimp and was nice and citrusy with avocados and pico. Beef taco was alright nothing special. But the shrimp tacos were super tasty. They are tiny street style two bite tacos, but really good. Although only one shrimp per taco which is a little chinsy. Will definately be back.
