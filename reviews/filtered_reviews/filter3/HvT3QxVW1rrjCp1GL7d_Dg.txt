The Good:
- The 5-cheese appetizer was delicious.
- Our server refilled out water and sweet teas without prompting.
- The food arrived quickly.

The Bad:
- The Chimichanga had corn inside (it wasn't listed on the menu).
- The soup one party member ordered was not delivered as an appetizer as requested, but instead was delivered with the rest of the entrees.
- The prices recently went up (December, 2014) which means that two taco's now cost $12 (previously, they were $10). That 20% price increase is seen across the menu.
