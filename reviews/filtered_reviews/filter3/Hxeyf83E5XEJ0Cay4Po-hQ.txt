I didn't think there was anything special about the food, it's more about the atmosphere.  Off the bat got free chips n salsa.  I got 3 tacos and a side for about $14: chicken,  beef, fish with black beans.  Tacos were street taco size but they jammed it with plenty of meat.   Black beans tasted plain but probably made from scratch.   Also got the almond horchata which was good but didn't get a lot of it since they filled the glass with mostly ice.   For dessert, got the churro with chocolate... If you've never had the real churro from Madrid then it's pretty tasty.  Would I come here again?   Probably just to hang out with friends but not for the food.
