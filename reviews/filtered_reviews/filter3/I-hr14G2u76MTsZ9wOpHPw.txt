Ate there on 10/23. My wife has a lobster dish which she liked very much. Unfortunately I was not so lucky, as I ordered chicken mole, a house specialty. The waiter explained it would take 30 minutes to slow cook, ok was fine with that. We sipped on margaritas, I had two and my wife one and they were delicious tasting if a bit weak on the alcohol. This surprised me as they were priced at $19. 

Now the bad news on the chicken, it was chewy and the mole sauce was just ok, not what  you would expect for the price and a restaurant purported to be as good  as this one.
