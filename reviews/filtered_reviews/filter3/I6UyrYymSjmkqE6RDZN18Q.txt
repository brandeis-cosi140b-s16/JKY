I am not sure if I just dislike Mexican fusion, so I have to preface with that. I don't think I do. The waitstaff was very friendly. The food was mediocre. I had a special, tilapia with cheese. It was OK. Tasted like something I could do. The other three diners seemed to enjoy their food. I think it was a little overpriced too.
