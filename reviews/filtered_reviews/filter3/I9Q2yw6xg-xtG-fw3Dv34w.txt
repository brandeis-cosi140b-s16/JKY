Nice Relaxing place to grab a bite to eat.

 I have been to the Old Pueblo Cafe on several occasions and have always enjoyed the food. Today my lunch comoanion and I ordered tamales and Mexican Flag enchiladas (1 chicken, 1 beef & 1 spinach,) with a side of rice & beans. The servings were  huge and tasty, we even took home some leftovers.

While waiting for our entr√©es, we sampled a basket of near perfect tortilla chips.  The chips were thin, crisp and lightly salted. The house made fresh pico de gallo salsa was a wonderful compliment, especially mixed with the hot sauce which is served separately.

The food is good, servings are generous, and the price is affordable.  The staff is always friendly, polite, and accomdating.  I would recommend you try Old Pueblo Cafe if you are in the area.   It's a nice relaxing place to grab a bite to eat.
