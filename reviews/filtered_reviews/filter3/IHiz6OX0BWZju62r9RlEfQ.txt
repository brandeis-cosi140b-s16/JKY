Only ever go here for lunch as I wouldn't say it's particularly a good spot for dinner. The nachos are especially good, not anything like the ones you buy in the store. Guacamole also is freshly made and recommended. The price I think could be slightly cheaper, the only reason it is on the pricey end is to obviously appeal to tourists due to their location. Overall, an ok Mexican spot if you're looking for a quick bite for lunch.
