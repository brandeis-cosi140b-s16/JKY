I think the only reason why this place has so many reviews is because it is centrally locate by several key hotels and ctl airport. If you are starving and need something quick, then this place is for you. If not, the cleanliness of the place and the over all cheap decor and picnic table furniture may scare away the slightest of above average consumer. The food I give a 3.. Service I give a 4, cleanliness I give a 2. Add those up= 9/3=3 stars in my book.
