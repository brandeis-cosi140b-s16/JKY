I'm kind of middle of the road when it comes to Z.  I think they're OK for happy hour, though their drinks aren't that great of a deal, but you don't need too many either.  Ada G. is addicted to their Chambord Margaritas and recreates them at home for us too.  As for their other food.  I've had a salad I liked and some apps were good but I've generally been a little disappointed with the rest.  My friend B's husband used to be a bartender at Scottsdale so once upon a time, we put in many Friday nights at the bar, sampling the wares.  Nowadays I just go for a "normal" happy hour and I'm not having to drive back to her house Sunday afternoon to get my car.  I'd have to say it's a much kinder, gentler approach.  Try them for happy hour.  Sit on the patio, enjoy the weather (unless it's summer) and have a margarita and some tostada bites.  I think you'll enjoy it.
