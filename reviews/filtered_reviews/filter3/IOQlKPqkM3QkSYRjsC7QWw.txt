I love options. I'm the kind of person that when I have chicken strips, I want 4 different dipping sauces.

This place fulfills my need for options in a way that their competitors can't.

The menu is a little confusing, and the daily specials board doesn't have prices or explain that it includes a drink.

I had the special, the chicken tostada salad, a tostada with rice and beans, piled with romaine, chicken, pico de gallo, a dollop of sour cream, tortilla strips, and some dressing that tasted EXACTLY like the jalapeno ranch I covered everything with at Chuy's when I lived in Texas. 

I also ordered chips and queso, which came with a pretty good salsa and more pico.

Drinks! Vanilla coke! Horchata! Tea and lemonade! (See what I mean about options?)

Everything is served in foil "to-go" containers, with lids on the condiment bar for easy transport.

Next time I go I think I'll try one of the tortillas they seem so proud of. 

Oh, and visit their website and click "I don't care" down toward the bottom. You'll thank me.
