Came here after recommendation from others as well as seeing the reviews on Yelp.

First off, the starter chips and refried beans/salsa are great. They come quickly, taste fantastic, and are plentiful.

Service is also great - I found it hard to reach the bottom of my glass before refills, waiters were (sincerely) friendly, etc.

Soon after ordering they brought an appetizer of spaghetti soup(?) which was way too salty for my taste.

I had ordered the fajita, which was just okay. The beans/rice/guac that came with were high quality but pretty sparse. It came with some pretty amazing flour tortillas though, which really carried the meal.

Flan topped off my lunch here for dessert. It was definitely too sweet and soft for my taste, but was edible.
