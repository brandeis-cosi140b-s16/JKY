The food was ok. The Korean element is very heavy in the flavor of te tacos. I ordered one calamari and two pork belly tacos. The food  has a hint of sweetness that is very different from any other Mexican joint in town. The specialty food is defiantly  one of a kind, however, being one of a kind is not always a compliment, and in the case of Komex it does not really add any level of satisfaction to the original.

The only reason I am writing this review is because the service I received was stupid. I ordered three tacos to go and was told that it would be a fifteen minute wait, no biggie, I took a walk for the fifteen minutes and then returned to the restaurant.  [this is what mad me decide to no longer go to this establishment] I walk in and am greeted by the same person that took my order no more than fifteen minutes ago, he asks me if I will be having my food to go or dining in, I do not understand how someone can forget a customer so quick, as if I never even came in. I t was not until I told him that I was just in there to pick up my order that I just placed, that her remembered who I was. Well he then proceeded to piss me the hell off, he gave my tacos away to some other customer. He must smoke an otherworldly amount of pot because  he forgot me on a slow night at that. He then apologized and said that my tacos will be remade. My tacos were done in approximately 7-8 minutes. 

In conclusion, I will never go to Komex again, not just because the service is shit, but because the food is overpriced and is not very good.

sorry komex dude, I just had to tell it like it is.

PS:the name reminds me of tampon box
