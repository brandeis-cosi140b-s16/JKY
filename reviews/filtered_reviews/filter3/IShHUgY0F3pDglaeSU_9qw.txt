Diablo's is definitely a tourist trap, located on the strip in front of the Monte Carlo, but the food is better than you'd expect. Our server was friendly and took our orders almost immediately, though she was slow to bring our drinks over. I was very surprised that chips and salsa was not free; for a place that charges almost $20 for three tacos and rice/beans and $12 for a small-ish margarita, it felt especially cheap. Our entrees - the aforementioned tacos and a chicken torta with fries - were adequately portioned but not for the price. You are definitely paying for the convenience of eating on the strip. Diablo's isn't a bad place to eat. Just know that you'll be paying around $50 for two people to have dinner.
