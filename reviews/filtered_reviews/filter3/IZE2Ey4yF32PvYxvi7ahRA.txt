It was good. But not the way I expected. I had carne Asada fries from Cali and they were AMAZING. Like out of the world amazing. The meat was good, it tasted like it was made by Ecuadorians. I say that because I've had that taste before (I'm half Ecuadorian and Puerto Rican.) it's NOT BAD. Just not what I wanted...it had a little sweet taste to it too...service was good, location is good. The horchata was delicious. Overall it was good. Like I said...not what I thought it would be. The again, it Cali so yeah...either way, still very good.
