So, my girlfriend came into town to help me move home, and she wanted to get some Mexican food.  I immediately thought of Macayo's, because I've been here before and love how colorful their interior was.

We walked in and were seated right away.  I was expecting it to be a bit busier for Father's day, but alas, there wasn't much going on here.  Our waitress was great, and we started off with chips and dip, and eventually ordered some dinner.

My girlfriend went with the Chicken chimichanga and she loved it! it looked really good from where I was sitting!  I went with the Nacho supreme, and it was tasty! My friend also got a margarita which looked nice as well.  

Overall, we had a good time here, and I enjoyed it. Our food was awesome, the service was pretty good and this place isn't half bad.
