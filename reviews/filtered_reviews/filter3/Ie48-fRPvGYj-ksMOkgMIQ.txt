This is one of the nicer Mexican restaurants I've been to and I was glad they take reservations because we were coming with a large group of co-workers to celebrate some birthdays. It was a Sunday night and when I arrived they had 2 large tables set up for our group, although the rest of the restaurant was pretty empty.

We had some margaritas, that were alright so I mostly opted for Dos Equis Amber drafts, which was served in tall skinny glasses. We ordered a few appetizers to share: queso dip and tableside guacamole, which was pretty cool since you got to see the waitress making a fresh batch for you. Everyone got various different entrees and I wasn't able to try them all but the quesadillas and tacos were tasty, as well as the tres leches cake for dessert. We told the waitress we were celebrating birthdays and she brought out brownies with burning sparklers so we could sing to our birthday peeps, which I thought was really nice of them.

I think we were there pretty close to closing time because service was a little slow and we only had 1 waitress despite having a group of about 15 people. In the end, we had a great time and the food was excellent, just took us a few hours to dine because everything seemed to move so slow...at least they didn't kick us out! We ended up leaving after 11 pm when their closing time was 10!
