I would not go here if you're looking for some delicious and authentic Mexican food because you won't find it here. 
The food was decent but overpriced (but hey it's Vegas). I got the sampler appetizer plate to share with a friend which basically had all the appetizers they offer on it. It wasn't that great. 
My other friend got the chips and guacamole...worst I've ever had at a restaurant which was shocking since they bragged about it so much on the menu. Don't care to ever go back.
