I have done pick up since place is so close to my job but last Friday was first time I at inside. The food is awesome but service is not that great. It took over 15 minutes to get our 2nd drink order placed and another 20 minutes before they even brought them back. They weren't even busy so I don't know why they took so long. Also I wanted to try the frozen margarita with sangria but the sangria wasn't frozen so had to settle for a a regular frozen margarita.
