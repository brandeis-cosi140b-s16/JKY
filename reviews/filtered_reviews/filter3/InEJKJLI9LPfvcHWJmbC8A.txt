Its been a few months since the last time i ate here but the grub was good.  The atmosphere was exactly what you would expect it to be for a Hard Rock hotel and casino. 

Depending upon where you sit you can see the Rehab pool just outside the windows. The decor is really cool and the place is well lit. If your into the modern vibe this is definitely a place to grab chow. 

The service was kind of slow but it was busy. They were kind of friendly but you felt like they greeted you because they had to not because they wanted to. If I to attend another convention here then I would eat at the Pink Taco. I just don't think that I would go out of my way to eat here.
