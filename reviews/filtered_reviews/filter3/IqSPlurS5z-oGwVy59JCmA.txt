I visited Tacos Jalisco the other day and was reminded of my old spots back in LA. I know good lick your plate clean Mexican food, so I have high standards. This place is definitely a hole in the wall joint and I actually passed it. You pretty much need to look for the Circle K and it shares the same lot. I was impressed that they had some of the "unusual" meat options like beef head meat and beef tongue (my faves). I came in hungry and ordered three tacos (two lengua/ one cabeza) and a bean & cheese burrito. I thought the meat kinda lacked salt, but the salsa from the salsa bar improved that. I enjoyed that the salsa bar had pickled carrots, califlower, jalapeno mix. Other then that the salsa was ok. The bean & cheese burrito was substantial. I actually could only eat half of it, which was challenging cus it was gud. I will be back to try more items and hope to improve my rating.
