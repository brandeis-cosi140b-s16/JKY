This place kind of disappointed me. Whatta bummer.

First of all, it's 2 places in one. Did not know that. From reviews I read before going, I was lucky enough to grab a parking spot out front because they're tiny little parking lot is usually valet. I hate valet!

Anyway, the cobblestone, hanging plant walk-way was pretty cute. Oh and the firepit seating and couches look like they'd be really cozy and intimate for an evening cocktail. So they've def got that going from them. Although when I was walking through the entrance no one greeted me. There were two guys who looked like they worked there just standing around. Come on, man.

The host thre me off too. He wasn't in a uniform or anything that identified him as the host, so I was a little taken back. 

But when we were seated, I loved the adobe like seating arrangements and the lighting in the place made me feel like I was in a 1950s New Mexico saloon having a whiskey at 2 o'clock in the afternoon with a surly old bartender... that's a good feeling.

Wasn't impressed that the waiter didn't bring us chips and salsa until 30 seconds before our meal arrived but they were tasty. I orded the Taos Club because I love avocados. It turned out to be more of  wrap cut into 3s and not wrapped tight enough because it was disaster to eat and nothing stayed inside. The accompanying salad would have been way better had it b=not been slathered in ranch. 

I had such high hopes for this place, but I honestly can't say that I'd go back. Wah Wahhh.
