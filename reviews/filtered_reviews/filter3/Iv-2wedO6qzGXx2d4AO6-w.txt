Ok, so I did go back, because I received a nice response for the manager. The next time I went, the service was great. The tacos were okay- I prefer a little more flavor and spice though. I get that it's not traditional, but it was just too bland for me... I'm into very flavorful things and it tasted like they didn't even use salt on the meat at all.

So... It's alright. If I'm in the area, I'm not opposed to going again, but it's not really a destination for me...
