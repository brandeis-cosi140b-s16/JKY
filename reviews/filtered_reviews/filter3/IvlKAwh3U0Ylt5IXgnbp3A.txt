I will be honest and to the point. 
You won't be happy with the burgers if you don't enjoy well done burgers. 

They offer many interesting and tasty combinations of burgers that are double stacked two oz. patties cooked well done from a char broiler on Brioche and many other items. In a small and very casual environment with good music in the background. Everything is also very reasonably priced. 

I tried the basic Paradise Burger with a side of fresno chili pesto and carnival corn. The burger was tasty but had a high bread ratio and all the fillings kept slipping out so it was hard to eat. I thought the fresno chili pesto was very good and also the carnival corn was seasoned and prepared nice.

My husband tried the Burger Brûlée. He said it was a mess to eat and he thought his double two oz. burgers were on the dry side. He wasn't a fan of the sweet sugar in it.

We tried a side of pretzel fries. The first one I tried tasted like sweet French Toast so that was a surprise. The next one was crisp fried pretzel roll. I wouldn't recommend the pretzel fries.

The burgers are clearly 5 stars compared to like an In-N-Out Burger type place.

Tasty and OK but not in the league with places that offer cooked to your liking.
