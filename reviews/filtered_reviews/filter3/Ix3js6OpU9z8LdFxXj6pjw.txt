I used to really like this place. Somehow my last visit here has lowered my expectations. I had the fish tacos and it really did not hit the spot. The prices have gone up and it seems as if the portions and quality has gone down. The chips and salsa are still awesome. Maybe on my next visit I can rekindle my feelings for this place.
