I so wanted to love this place. I was in the area to get a haircut with fave barber but told he was on break. So I decided to venture out in the area for lunch. The beautiful entrance door caught my attention and decided to try it.

Since I broke my foot, I'm crutchin' along with the dang boot on my left foot. I must have arrived minutes before the lunch rush. I sat at a little table in a corner. Waitress took my order.  Because the tables are so close to one another and filled, I couldn't go to the Salsa bar to try a few sauces. 

I ordered the guacamole which was yummy -- love guaca guaca! When I ordered two chicken tacos, I expected two nice size tacos. Instead I felt as though I ordered two tacos off the menu section for kids.

Waitress never returned to refill my glass of tea. I may return and give this place a try when I'm no longer in need of crutches. Nothing grand here...now run along kids...

PS...They do not accept AMEX!
