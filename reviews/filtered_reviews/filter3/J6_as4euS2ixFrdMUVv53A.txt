This neighborhood spot is know by locals as an alternative to the overpriced Vegas strip Mexican food that claims to be authentic. The menudo is a friend to any hungover party goer needing a fix from too much tequila or cerveza. They also make a decent Michelada if the menudo doesnt seem to ride you of the pounding headache or embarresment of the night before. If you feel the need for some homemade Mexican food then Dona Maria is the senora you should see.
