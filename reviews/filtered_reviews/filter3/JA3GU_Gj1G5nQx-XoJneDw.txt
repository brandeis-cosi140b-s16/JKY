Los Tacos was very much worth the price I paid for tacos.  The quality of meat, salsa, pico, and guac was excellent ! However the burritos weren't as good as I had expected, the beans are mediocre and the size is reasonable. But I suppose thats why its called Los Tacos, not Los Burritos :b I highly recommend the Lengua Tacos con TODO!! (minus the sour cream)
