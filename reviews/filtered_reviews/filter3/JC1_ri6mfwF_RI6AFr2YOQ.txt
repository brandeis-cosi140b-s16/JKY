It gives me great regret to have to write this review but after being a loyal patron for over a decade, the last experience for the food was not that great so I'm hoping this review lands in the right hands for a major makeover in the kitchen and get it back to what it once was.

We can only judge by the last performance. Guilty that I didn't rave about this place with positive reviews over the past decade but it is what it is. Our last experience (after several experiences of it going consistently downhill) just screams to review negatively on the quality of the food to hopefully save this place. Pink Taco has been my place to go at least a couple of times a month for the past several years.

The front line Staff is outstanding. 5 stars for the staff. No complaints there when it comes to this. "Shank" the bartender is outstanding if you eat at the bar. Definitely 5 stars for this guy. Last two trips on orders being wrong or the food being burnt, he took care of it and made it right. 

So... let's get into the food for the last visit which was not that great. Happy Hour $6 menu which is appealing to order multiple things when it's more then one person to do the whole sharing thing.

-- Chicken Tacquitos --- Burnt to a crisp. Shank took these back and got a decent order back. Still tasted worse then what I could buy in the grocery store for $2.00 and throw in the microwave. Fact of the matter is though, they let the first order come out burnt to a crisp which should tell you everything about the kitchen staff. 

-- Grilled Chicken Skewers -- I'm thinking there is going to be some veggies on these skewers like real skewers but nope. Dry, no seasoning and pathetic. For the Happy Hour price, Del Taco is FAR MORE TASTY for a third of the price.

-- Tortas -- This was like mystery meat. We have no idea what that meat was but it was pretty disgusting. Pretty sure the stomach aches that followed this recent trip were because of whatever meat that it was. I've been all over the world and have had street meat in foreign countries (could have been pigeon, dog, cat or rat meat) that was far tastier. I would highly advise to stay away from these.

-- Cerviches --The fish was certainly tasting fishy. Maybe that's what made our stomachs upset after this meal because the fish certainly was not fresh.

Big Plus -- Mi Casa Margarita was pretty tasty. Not as good as the top shelf margarita (which is awesome there) but not bad for $6.  

All in all... Happy Hour Menu for $6 isn't a good deal. Del Taco is far better for far less so I have to advise to stay far away from it. Main menu has much better things and I really have to RAVE about Pink Taco having the BEST Chile Relleno's in town. 

I feel bad for the great staff there because the kitchen has gone downhill when it comes to the quality of the food there. Bartenders are awesome there -- absolutely fantastic. However, the kitchen needs a TON of help. I mean really, who in the heck who has any pride in their food would send out food burnt to a crisp??? 

So hopefully... this review catches the attention of the right people and they clean out that kitchen problem so I come back and give this very cool place a great review. The front line staff is fantastic but the kitchen needs some serious help.
