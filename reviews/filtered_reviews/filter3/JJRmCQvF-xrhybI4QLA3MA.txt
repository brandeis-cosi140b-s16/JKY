The service? Total crap.. the guy didn't refill our empty sodas once.

The scene? Awesome.. LOVE the new patio overlooking the pool. It feels like vacation on my lunch break . yesss

The food: As yelp would say.. "A-OK". I got the fajita "buffet" if you will. Consisting of fajitas "cooked to order" (heated up for 20 seconds on a grill). Fajitas were decent, and you could get enchiladas as well. Only 9.99 for lunch.. not a terrible deal.
