The fish tacos were good and the trendy atmosphere was nice. But, the whole thing was a bit too formula...like "restaurant in a box" concept. No outlyers, not much spice, fairly bland, middle of the road.....but wait, its in Arizona! Ok, no political jokes re Arizona. I was so-so with Blanco and will continue to explore on the next visit.
