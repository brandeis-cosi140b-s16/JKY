This review saddens us.  We used to LOVE this place for having one of the best ribeye's in town.  We came here last night because we wanted a great dinner, what we got was anything but that.  The ribeye's which they charge $38 for was not even worth $10.  The last time we were here a medium rare ribeye was very juicy and tender, last night it was dry, hard and a very bad cut of meat.  

My wife's was so bad she sent it back.  The manager came over and apologized saying she did not know if maybe it was the vendor did not have exactly what they ordered this time or what happened.  She did apologize and took the ribeye off our bill and told my wife she would also comp dessert or another drink for here.  She said she did not want the dessert but would have another drink.  Guess what $12 charge for the drink, no comp???

A big deal, NO not really, just another sign of a great place going down hill.  I am not sure what happened to the quality of the meat they use, but the ribeye I had was nothing like the last time.  Also, when someone tells you they will do something, they should make sure it happens.  

Our server was new only been there a few months, but the entire feel of attention to detail and service was so different then the last visit we had.  It is sad to say this place will now be off our list of good places to visit.  

I still encourage you to give this place a shot, just know in advance everything is very spicy even though the waiter will tell you "NO, its not spicy at all".  This is not a bad thing just something to be aware of as not everyone likes spicy foods.
