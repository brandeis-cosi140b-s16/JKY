I'm not sure I understand the hype. The staff at the bar is great! They were 100% on point for being VERY busy. The drinks, we just had beers, were good. The queso with chorizo was great.  We waited an hour for a table and decided to order food to go. It arrived quickly,  we paid and left. We were missing a taco (we ordered 8 items and were missing one.... unacceptable.)  Overall? I'd go back for a drink and some queso dip. Not much else.
