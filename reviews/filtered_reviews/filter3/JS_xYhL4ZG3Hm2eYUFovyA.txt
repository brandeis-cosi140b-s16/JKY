Pretty decent New Mexican food. Chimichanga was a bit soggy and serving sizes could be larger.

Nothing extremely "New Mexican" about this place. The owner was pretty cool though. All in all this is just cafe style mexican food a tiny step above a place like Filibertos and a step below Arribas. You can take it from there.


If you want a real treat and a good dive, try Elmers tacos. Much better although it's in the geto.
