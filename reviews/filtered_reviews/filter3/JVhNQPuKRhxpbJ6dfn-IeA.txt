What you get here is a million dollar view of the valley with sightly less food value. Yes the food is OK, what is memorable are the chips, salsa and the favorable bean dip served quickly when you are seated. The menu is overwhelming and takes a while to absorb. The wait staff is professional and attentive. The food portions are good, but the food is average at best. My son had the Fried Garlic Snapper and said it was very bland and had no garlic taste. My wife had Carnitas and said she had better. I came out on top with the Pork Chop dish (Can't even give the Mexican name) which had an excellent sauce. However, the rice and bean sides were bland and ordinary, the bean dip was better tasting. I have had better refried beans at places like Fausto's. The Spanish rice was dry and flavorless. Deserts were wonderful, the flan was tasty and very creamy, everyone liked the  cake. Go here for the ambiance and view and don't have great expectations for the food.
