My husband and I love cafe rio. I've been to almost all of them in Utah but this cafe rio in particular isn't up to par with the other ones. The rice is usually overlooked or undercooked. No one there knows the proper way to present the tres leches by flipping on a small plate adding whipped cream and sliced strawberries. They just hand it to you in one of the tin containers with a plastic top. I even told them they didn't make it right and they had no idea what I was talking about. Anyway that's my rant.
