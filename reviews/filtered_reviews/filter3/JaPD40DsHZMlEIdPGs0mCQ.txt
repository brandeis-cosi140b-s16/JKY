I went there on last Saturday night for dinner with my husband, and while the food was very good the service was horrid.  We were seated immediately and within 30 seconds our waiter came to the table to take our order.   We told him that we were just seated and needed time to look at the menu.  We did order club sodas and the bus boy brought those over with chips and salsa within 2 minutes.  The waiter came back a few minutes later to take our order.  Our first course was a tomato based soup which was very good.  About 10 minutes after we ordered our meal it showed up to the table.  I was beginning to feel a little rushed.  A moment later the bus boy showed up at our table and tried to clear away our chips and salsa that we were still eating.  I let him know this and he left them and went away.   My husband ordered chicken fajitas and it only came with 3 very small tortillas.  We got the attention of our waiter as requested a few additional.  By the time he brought them back to the table 15 minutes later my husband had just continued to eat his dinner with a fork and no longer required them as we had finished eating.  We then requested to go containers.  The waiter brought them to the table.  As my husband and I were packing up our leftovers the bus boy again came by and tried to clear my dishes before I could pack up my food.  My plate was over half-full when he tried to take it.  I again say while the food was very good the wait staff needs additional training.  I do not think we will be visiting this location again.
