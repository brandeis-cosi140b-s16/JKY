When you go to Vegas, even for a day, you have to try a restaurant so we chose the Border Grill for lunch.

"Freebies" - really tasty salsa varieties and nachos, room temp water I wasn't thrilled with.

The grilled chicken torta was absolutely delicious, and surprisingly well balanced - you could taste each ingredient and nothing overpowered.  And best of all, the sandwich didn't go soggy as so many do.  I wanted to like the smoked paprika fries, but honestly, nothing special.
Citrus Chicken quesadilla was easily the best quesadilla I've been able to try in my somewhat limited experience.

4 people, $100 lunch all told.  Tasty food and good atmosphere.  Worth a second trip for sure.
