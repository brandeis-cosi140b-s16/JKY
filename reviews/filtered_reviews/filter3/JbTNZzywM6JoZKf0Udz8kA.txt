Came in here expecting great things considering I was craving both a hamburger and a taco and couldn't make up my mind. I thought a cheeseburger and short rib taco sounded great, especially considering it came with my two fav ingredients: onion and cilantro. Well I was really hungry, drove into a very busy drive thru and decided to dine in. Only one problem: one girl was working the register for drive thru, naturally, and there was a guy both working as a runner and a cashier which meant I did not get service until 10-16 minutes later . I ordered what I wanted and thought it as nice that they offered free fries on Mondays. So I get my order, decide to find a seat outside and find that my leggings nearly ripped a hole when it got caught on a sharp end on one of the cheap aluminum chairs. Had there actually been a rip I would have been so angry. But only, just a pilled part that I need to scissor off. Also, my taco did not come with any cilantro like it said it would as well, although he food was good.Anyway, I wasn't all that impressed with my first experience. Not sure if it's worth coming back...
