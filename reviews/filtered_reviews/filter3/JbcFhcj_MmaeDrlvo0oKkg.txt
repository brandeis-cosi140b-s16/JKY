I went there because it looked like a fun place.
After practicing filling out their crazy menu online I dragged the hubster and a few other relatives. The Jade Chicken was fantastic, but nothing else notable.
Cinnamon hockey puck? Thumbs up.

I might go again if I crave the chicken. Maybe takee outee next time :)
