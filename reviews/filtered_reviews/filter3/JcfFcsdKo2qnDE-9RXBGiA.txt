Pretty good Mexican place.  Reasonably priced, but you're not getting as big a portion as you would from a slightly more expensive Mexican restaurant so...less money for less food.  This is actually fine with me because I never finish the giant portions from other Mexican restaurants anyway.

The guacamole was good, but not excellent. It was actually room temperature which I did not like.  The carne asada burrito was good, although the meat was slightly dry.  The green salsa was delicious, the red salsa was watery and lacked flavor.  I don't know about you, but I'm not into watery salsa.  

Wait staff was great, I don't have anything bad to say there.

All in all, I'd say The Blind Pig has OK food, nothing exceptional.  But I had a good time there and it satisfied my Mexican craving.
