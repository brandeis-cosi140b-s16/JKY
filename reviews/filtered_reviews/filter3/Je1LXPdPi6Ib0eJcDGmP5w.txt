As a veg my review may contrast others.

This place is a chipotle of enchiladas. Pick your tortilla filling(s) and toppings.

For the veg crowd there are 3 ish choices, spinach and mushrooms (good concept but need a bit more flavor and mushrooms), pepper jack potatoes and corn bread. I have only tried the former two to date. For sauce there is only 1 veg option the green. top it with some cheese, melt it and then some salsa and slaw. Looks great.

The down sides are
1. lines quickly form as the melting of the cheese becomes a bottle neck
2. The taste is nothing special the green sauce and the soft tortillas makes this remind me of an Amy's dish
3. I was still hungry afterwards

Give it a try and see if it is your thing, for me my ~7 can be spent elsewhere.
