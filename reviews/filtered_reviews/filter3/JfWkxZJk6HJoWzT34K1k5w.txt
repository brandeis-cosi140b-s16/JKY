So, I made it back to Vida, and as I said was going to try the crab nachos. So, before my thoughts on the nachos, I love the chips & salsa. The chips were hot & the salsa is what I love. So, the nachos...the pictures looked better than they were. Yes, they were okay, but they were black beans & melted cheese w/ a few pieces of crab. I wish there was a little more crab. And, the place was packed so our waitress was MIA. A great lunch spot, but some menu items old be improved, especially for the price.
