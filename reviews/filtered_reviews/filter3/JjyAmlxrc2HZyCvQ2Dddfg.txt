To be fair, we came here because we had been told no more wine at Postino's across the way so perhaps we were a little grouchy already.  The atmosphere is cheery and bright.  The servers are pretty and helpful.  The food is good just not what I'd crave of think of when I think of Mexican food in Az.  Example:  queso ordered and no spice whatsoever.  This is the perfect place to take your hipster friends from the Midwest who would be a little to squeamish at the idea of going to South Phoenix for the original Los Dos Molinos, or simply and won't handle spicy food.  On the positive side, a good place to take friends who are vegetarian, a lot more offerings than your typical restaurant.
