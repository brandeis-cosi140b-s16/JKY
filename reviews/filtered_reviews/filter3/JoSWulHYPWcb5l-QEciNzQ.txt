There is such a WIERD vibe in here tonight . We waited 20minutes for our drinks after ordering them, while,   in the meantime three different people came over to take our food order!!  take our food order!!!! Can I take your food order?????  CAN WE GET OUR DRINKS FIRST? The girl with the bull ring in her nose, was just clueless. I reordered  a diet coke three times and when she brought me the last one, you'd think she would have taken away the  three REGULAR cokes that were piling up, nope, just left them there. Ughh! It's Not like anybody is really rude or mean, but there is no attention to detail or customer service.  The waiter, as precious as he thinks he is, is rushing by and throws down drinks without stopping, spills water all over the table as he refills the water glasses, giggling  it off as he saunters away, leaving us to wipe up the splattered water that is on the table and cell phones with our own napkins. Then he hounds us to order order order! Ready to order ready to order ready to order???????????????????we haven't  even gotten our appetizers yet. I thought the place was closing based on the urgency to order only to be told
They are open another 90 minutes. We are paying the bill for our appetizer and going over to Postino. Something is just to weird and it's making me a NERVOUS WRECK!
