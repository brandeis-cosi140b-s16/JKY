Yeah the food was 'OK', nothing too special but still good.  I ordered a burrito enchilada style.  I thought the sauce was really good, but the burrito itself wasn't great.  The burrito simply doesn't have enough meat in it, or enough variety of fillers.  I prefer something like the nacho burrito from Baja Fresh which has all sorts of good things in the burrito as well as enough meat.  A lot of people seem to love this place b/c it's always jam packed, but I don't see why it's considered so much better than anywhere else that sells the same types of food.  Service was pretty good, and despite the long line the wait isn't bad because the line moves quickly.  The inside can get crowded though.
