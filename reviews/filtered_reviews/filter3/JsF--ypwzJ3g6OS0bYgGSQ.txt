We were looking for a place that would be open late around Aria, and this was perfect because it closes at midnight. We literally walked to the hostess at 11:45 p.m. and she was able to seat us. The next night though, we walked by and the restaurant was packed, so it might be wise to make a reservation. The chips and salsa, along with the margarita, were delicious. 

The food here was good, but could have been better if some had not been overcooked. I had two tacos: one shrimp and one carne asada. The shrimp taco was perfectly cooked and really delicious. The carne asada was a pass: the meat was good but it was literally meat, avocado, and a little bit of onion, which made the taco too dry. I did like the sides of rice and beans though. The BF had the lobster enchilada. The lobster was a little dry and overcooked, and it was hard to taste the lobster with everything else going on in the dish. We wouldn't order this again.

Overall, it was a good experience, but too pricey in our opinion. I don't think most people will spend $$$ for tacos and enchiladas. I would only stop by again for drinks and some chips and salsa.
