I decided to come here after driving past it so many times. The first thing I noticed was their dull menu, no creativity what so ever. I'm a graphic designer so for me precentation means a lot. Anyway, I ordered a tripa and an al pastor. I was the only one there, and it took them a good five minutes to prepare them. Not only that, they messed up my order, they gave me a cabeza instead of tripa. Very disappointed. 

If I ever come back I'll know what to expect.
