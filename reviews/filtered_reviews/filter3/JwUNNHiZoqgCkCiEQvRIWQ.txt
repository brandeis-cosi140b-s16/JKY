Z Tejas
Chain restaurant with predictable yet decent food. Here are the reasons I go there.

The best Chambord Margaritas and Peach Mojitos you will ever have! They are very overpriced but so potent you won't even feel the dent in your wallet after 2. Yea I said it - 2. They cut you off at 3 (but if you're at a table you can sneak one at the bar :)

Food that keeps me coming back~
