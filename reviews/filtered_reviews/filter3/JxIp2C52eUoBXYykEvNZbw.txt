So I came here recently for lunch for a work meeting. I chose the carne asada which had guacamole, rice, beans and a baked potato. The meat was ok, a little tough and a bit over-seasoned (as were the sides) for my taste. For dessert we shaa plate of churros that had a side of ice cream that tastedlike caramel or leche quemada. They were so good we ordered another plate! 

The chips are kept heated in a popcorn/carnitas cart, and they are super delish! Super fatty and salty, I could've eaten my weight in tortilla chips!

Sadly, I dodn't order a margarita since I was working, but I am sure they would be pretty good. Random fact, the margarita is one of the most popular cocktails in the U.S.
