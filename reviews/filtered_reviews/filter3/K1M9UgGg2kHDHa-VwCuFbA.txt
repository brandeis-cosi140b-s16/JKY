I visited CDJ for the first time last night because I don't live in the neighborhood and was meeting a friend.

The service was fast and friendly, in fact, our beers and food came out so quickly I was a little shocked. My friend informed me that the food is alway fast. But I know why: the same rice and beans adorn every plate. In fact, the only difference from our two plates was my eggs were probably fried in a pan and his chimichanga was probably fried in a deep fryer.

I thought our service was great from the time we walked in to the time we left. Everyone was happy, friendly, and helpful. This goes a long way for me even if the food isn't that great. I would even go as far to say that the service is what kept this place from getting a two-star rating from me. 

Unfortunately, the food wasn't good enough in my book to make a return visit. The food was generally underseasoned and un-inspiring. This is very standard Mexican fare and nothing outside the box. Maybe it is what it is, but this place is a cliche of a place with excellent service..
