I had to see what all the fuss was about.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was awesome, very cool, she let me try a few of the beers on tap before I settled on an IPA.  

I ordered an elote.  Well, it was good but I've had better and all the hairs from the corn were not removed and they got stuck in my teeth.  Not cool.  I also had the Naco torta.  The over easy egg was the best over easy egg I've ever had in my entire life.  That's where it ended for me, the meat was meh the avocado slices were more like avocado slithers. 

I think this is a terrific spot to kick back and drink, perhaps have some apps but the food was like white boy Mexican food, not for me.
