(Lyrics - The Outfield - Your Love)

Mexican food in Phoenix is far away
Come sometimes and try it over
So many things that I want to eat
You know I like my tacos little bit spicy
Let's go to Comedor Guadalajara tonight!
Let's go to Comedor Guadalajara tonight!

Comedor Guadalajara is one of those sketchy looking places that borderlines danger and well maybe a little adventure wouldn't hurt!

Needless to say, from the outside the location of this place is pretty off beat (Ghetto!) in my books.  The inside is totally different.  Family friendly and staff is pretty up beat and on the ball.  I came here with my family and we ordered a bunch for Happy Hour!  I went for the sampler appetizer platter and the Mole Chicken Enchiladas with a Modelo beer.  The appetizer came with mini shredded beef tacos on a crispy shell, frijoles, mini cheese crisp, and guacamole.  Overall, a nice start, the platter was perfect for sharing for 2 and a great combination with a beer.  The Mole chicken was steaming hot and came with refried beans and rice.  It was thick and creamy with a minor hint of cocoa which was perfect!  

Overall, service was top notch.  The food was very good for Phoenix Mexican cuisine.  I can't say it's the best in town cause it's a give or take thing.  In the end, what makes Mexican food for me is the sauce and salsa.  Comedor Guadalajara delivers on the food part, but the sauces really makes the difference on my palates! - Enjoy!
