Growing up in the Southwest I can honestly say that I am to Mexican food what Casey Anthony is to scandalous whoring.  With that being said, La Fonda Del Sol can most aptly be described as better than average... more than adequate....above par...and a step above decent. The chips and salsa were very good but the pollo fundito had way too much cream cheese. The side of refried beans and rice was perfect. At many Mexican restaurants, beans and rice are a throwaway. An afterthought. Not here. These sides truly stole the show. One aspect of my visit that was very disappointing was the fact that they don't serve Tecate in a can.  The can is necessary for one to smear bit's of lime, lime juice and salt around the surface of said can to truly appreciate the wonders of a perfect beer on a hot summer evening, with the beading, condensation dripping down the side of the freezing cold can and chunks of acidic lime flesh washing down the smooth, light hoppiness that is indicative of a good Mexican cerveza.
