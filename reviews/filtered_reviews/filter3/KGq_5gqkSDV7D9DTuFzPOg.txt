This place is unique. It's like the typical Mexican joint in AZ but it's own by a white 6'4" guy that speaks Spanish, ayfkm?

Super friendly people, good variety and just for fun I checked in via FB and there were like 1,200 people who had checked in this 8 table place, wtf?

Anyways, being a Mexican food aficionado (and after living in Mexico for several years) I have to say that although the tacos are decent, they are far from authenticity.

I had carne asada con nopal (a platter with rice, black beans, carne asada and cactus leave) which was barely OK. The meat was like the asian fast food, you know? Softer than it should as if they add flour or something like that. The beans were runny, and the rice uneventful.

The taco al pastor was good but it was anything but authentic.

All in all, an OK place to swing by if you're in the area but nothing I would crave.

The interesting thing is that a lot of americans were eating there, good looking women, big Mercedes parked in the parking lot, I mean, it has it's drive for sure!

Try it and if you don't expect much, you won't be disappointed.
