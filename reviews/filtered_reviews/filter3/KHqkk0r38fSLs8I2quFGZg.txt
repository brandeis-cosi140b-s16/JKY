This is a 3.5 star place but again no half star system yet... hmm.

Okay People - we have to agree that there are not too many (if any) authentic mexican joints in town.  Basically, they serve food that a bunch of gringos will eat... just like everyone else.  I am ok with that, too.  

The food here is just fine, I would say it slightly above average amaricanized mexican food.  I can't go any further that that because their chile relleno is below average.  

I will tell you why I like this place.  It is a huge restaurant with plenty of room and very comfortable for 2 or a large group.  I do like the atmosphere here to.

I have been here atleast 25 times.  The service is always excellent.  

When you consider the whole package; food, service, venue, price... I would say I really like this place.
