Solid place for tasty eats.  The guac is very good and goes with everything.  :)  Most people are familiar with Chipotle, so I don't feel the need to write a lengthy review (for once!).  Let's just say that if one wants a quick, relatively healthy meal, choosing Chipotle is better than most places.  Select your form (bowl/salad/burrito), your meat (if desired), and your toppings and you're good to go.  Ol√©!
