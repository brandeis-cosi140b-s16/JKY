good but NOT amazing.


My Dinner - ordered stacked enchiladas - not impressed with the quantity at all. Such a small serving with too much rice and beans for such a high price

My Dessert - really good - chocolate chip cookie

His Dinner - chicken chimichanga - edible but not impressive

His Dessert - crem brulee - very good


We give it 3 stars because it was a good meal but not amazing...wouldn't go again

Still looking for an amazing mexican spot that isn't a dive!
