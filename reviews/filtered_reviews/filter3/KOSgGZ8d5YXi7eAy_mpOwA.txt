We came here for a Saturday lunch and were seated right away.  The booths are comfortable and the waiter was helpful and attentive.  Maybe it's because I now see this place is "Tex Mex," but there was loud country music playing.  I like country, but this was very hillbilly country.

The food was excellent.  I opted for one of the combos and got a chicken quesadilla with the small chopped salad.  Both items were good although I think if I went back I would just get the chopped salad since it was so yummy.  My family enjoyed the quesadillas and tacos as well.
