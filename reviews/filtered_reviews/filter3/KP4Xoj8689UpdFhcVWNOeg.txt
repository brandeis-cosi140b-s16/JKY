Pepe's Tacos is decent. I've had better, but this is close to where I live. Since it's open 24 hours, I can always pop in whenever I'm craving a Taco. As the reviews before me have said, this place is mediocre at best. I had 3 different tacos, the Carnitas, Al Pastor, and Buche. I did the 3 tacos combo with a drink for $6.50... Pretty decent deal. The cashier asked if i wanted 'everything' on it, and I replied with yes. I guess I'm used to Tacos el Gordo, because when they say 'everything' at that place, they give you toppings that compliment the taco. However, at Pepe's Tacos, all 3 of mine had the same. This made all 3 of my tacos taste exactly the same, with just the texture of the meat different. 

If I was in a rush or had a late night taco run, I'd probably drop by again. Otherwise, I'd probably go elsewhere. sorry!
