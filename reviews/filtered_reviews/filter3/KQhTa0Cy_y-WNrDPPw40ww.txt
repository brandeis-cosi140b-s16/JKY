I'll have to agree with my brother, and fellow reviewer, Ryan B. that the portions here are tiny. I ordered a $4 Vampiro, which was a flat, 1/2 taco shell covered in carne asada, cheese, and some green salsa. I didn't expect a full meal, but more that a half of a taco. I also ordered the ceviche, which is AWESOME! Served with a tiny potion of salsa, this ceviche is fresh and tasty! They only make it on Friday and Saturdays, which is why I only go to ATS on those days. Service is so-so. The staff doesn't look too thrilled to be there and have never been overly friendly. My biggest complaint is a can of soda is $1.50!! That is crazy! I am not a cheap person, but I really cannot stomach paying this much for a can of Diet Coke. I usually stop at a gas station on the way back to work to buy a soda because I cannot justify paying that much for a soda.
