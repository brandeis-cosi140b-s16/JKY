The food would get 5 starts, but  I am sooo Frustrated that  they have to nickel and dime you and even charge extra for condiments! The quesadillas are $7.50 and only have 3 oz of cheese in them and $1.25 for extra salad dressing WTF???? They even charged me extra for shredded cheese on my veggie salad- I feel so taken advantage of it is hard for me to enjoy the food...I think the most annoying part is that they have to say "Extra Cheese" very loudly in a sing song voice so it sounds campy as the cashier quickly rings it up and reams you at the same time...
