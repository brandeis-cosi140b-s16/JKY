Pretty good. I got a fish burrito and a coke for $5 in that cute little brown bag that I dig so much. It was enough food to save some for later. The waitress/staff person was *really* nice! It was my first fish taco, so I have nothing to compare it to, but the prices and location will make me come back. I look forward to having other food there and I'll let you know. I finally had to have one of the brownies (I usually eat at magic mushroom burger). It was interesting. It was soft, but the chocolate chips were sort of crunchy.  That may not sound too good, but it was a unique take on brownies and didn't make me like it any more or less. Of course, there were jokes about, "Don't tell anyone where you got them", and that was almost the sole reason I wanted one. My friend and I shared it and we had some left over.
