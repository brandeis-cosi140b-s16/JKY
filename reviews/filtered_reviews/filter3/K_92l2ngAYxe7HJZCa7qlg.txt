They don't clean the grill here.  However, that's a good thing.  The flavors created by the crusty sear on that filthy grill are delicious.

I ordered the three taco combo meal, without the beans and rice.  I think it's the #4 if you're ordering the McDonald's way.  The good thing about this deal is that you get to mix and match your tacos.  So I got the shrimp, carne asada, and their famous tilapia.  Served with a soda for $5.99 and it's a great deal for a lighter lunch.  Very delicious tacos loaded with shredded cabbage and sharp Mexican cheese, accompanied some fresh radish, cucumber, and homemade salsa.

The hot sauce bar is pretty cool.  They serve about 50 different bottled hot sauces; I tried about 5 different ones that I thought were crazier looking.  I was hoping the flavor of the crazy looking hot sauce bottles would match their packaging, however each one disappointed.  The homemade salsa served with the tacos is fantastic.  Skip the bottled gimmicky stuff and stick with the sauce they put on the plate for you, just ask for an extra side. 

The grill at the Baja Bar and Grill wasn't the only thing that hasn't been cleaned in a while; the entire restaurant seemed just as dirty.  From the sticky, self-serve soda station covered with trash, to the overly stocked hot sauce buffet where each bottle was filthy and crusty by the 67 other people that used the bottle before you.  This place is kind of a dirty dive.  Did I mention the help yourself, complimentary licorice they offer to everyone?  Just think how many grubby hands dig their way into the tub o' twizzlers, right after they lick their fingers clean from the delicious tacos offered here.  I'm not a germaphobe, but there are a few things I would definitely stay away from at this restaurant. 

I'll come back to this place.  The tacos are amazing.  This place lost a star, maybe even two for cleanliness.  But like the saying goes, what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
