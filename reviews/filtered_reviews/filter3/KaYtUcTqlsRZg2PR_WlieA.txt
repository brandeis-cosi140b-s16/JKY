As a long time patron of Chino Bandido I have been accustomed to a certain level of quality when it comes to the food. Up until recently that quality has been excellent and it is for that reason alone I am able to give this even 3 stars. I am particularly speaking of this Chandler location. The quality here has been highly inconsistent. When this location first opened (and for months after) the food was actually hot and they certainly did not skimp on anything. Today, I was so disappointed that I had to write about it. The food temperature was lukewarm, at best. The food quantity seemed like it was half of what I had been accustomed to. It was just such a disappointment.

On the positive side I did notice that they have happy hour now so I may have to make my way back to try it out.
