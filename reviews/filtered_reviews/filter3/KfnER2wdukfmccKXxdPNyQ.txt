This is a solid option for Mexican food and some drinks. Good atmosphere but it's kinda on par with Chevys...it is not the best Mexican or authentic but it was definitely good. 

Chicken fajitas was tasty paired with a shot of patron and some tecate...bottom line: I'd come back next time im in town for spring training since it's right next to the giants Scottsdale stadium!
