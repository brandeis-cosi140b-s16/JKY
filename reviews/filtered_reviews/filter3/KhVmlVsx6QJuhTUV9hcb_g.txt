Aunt Chilada's combines festive decor and loud Mariachi music with pretty standard Mexican fare. The entrees were large and reasonably priced. I did enjoy my smoked pork chinalinga and the choice of salsas -- verde or roja in mild, medium or hot.. But still, the pluses aren't enough to drive out of your way for a visit. 

Another note: it did seem like the place to go if you are into drinking a lot (which I am not), so keep that in mind if you're looking more for a place to bring the kiddies or your 80-year-old aunt Rose.
