Despite rave reviews from other Yelpers and friends, I found my Gadzooks experience tonight fairly average. Now, my choices were more limited as a vegan, but I was looking forward to the spinach-mushroom tacos. I topped them off with Pico de Gallo and guacamole. We also ordered the chips with the roasted Roja salsa. 
The corn tortillas were outstanding and held up so well to the filling. I found the sauteed spinach-mushroom combo to be okay, not anything too flavorful. The guacamole needed something more, in my opinion. If I am going to eat guacamole while visiting AZ, I have high expectations. I thought it was bland. The chips were also okay. So, my meal was good but nothing that would bring me back in a hurry. I will say the enchiladas looked delicious. Worth a try if you are in the area, especially for cheese and meat lovers.
