I can't believe that I have never been to Diablo's Cantina. It is yet another one of those joints you pass by while in Vegas, place on your to-do list and watch it sit on that list for a while... until this last trip.

It all started with one of those retarded fliers promising you a margarita for like $3-5. Normally, my BS detector is kicking and screaming telling me "hey stupid head... you can't get a decent drink in Vegas for $5. why the hell did you even take the coupon let alone walk into the f'in place". Yea, I know. I fell for it. Maybe because I was drinking... maybe because my inner cheap bastard took over for a nano-second. Whatever the case, we ended up here.

The "discount" margarita is pretty much what you would expect... its in a fucking glass the size of thimble and the Nyquil in your medicine cabinet has more f'in alcohol than whats in the drink right in front of you. Not that it stops you from drinking it anyway because you don't want to lose you buzz... but you quickly realize, you just screwed up badly.

We continue on and order a cadillac margarita and what do you know it comes in a normal sized margarita glass... you feel almost embarrassed that you even ordered the "discount" margarita just from the sheer size difference between the two. You almost expect that the "discount" margarita would come in a sippy cup or something that a kid might drink his apple juice from. Anywho, the cadillac is pretty good. Of course, we have to have another. And another.


Oh yea... we order some food too. Like the following....

* Taquitos - I enjoyed these. Pretty good and tasty

* Angry Calamari - Yea... made me pretty angry because they calamari was a little fishy smelling. When I say a little.... I mean a fucking lot.

* Diablo's Hot Wings - Not bad... but then again its hot wings. Hard to screw that shit up. Put frozen hot wings on plate, hit the f'in microwave for 4-5 minutes, boom... you have hot wings.

* Guacamole - Filler food. Next!

* Fajitas Combo - Not bad. This is probably what saved this place. Decent food at a decent price.


Your probably asking yourself... damn, you ate a lot. Naw tons-of-fun, the food was over 2 visits because we happen to be staying at the hotel where the joint was at. Overall, it wasn't bad. Will I come here again? Probably. The margaritas were decent minus the one meant for the midget... but I can't complain too much. Oooops. Already did. I give this place a 3..... out of 5.
