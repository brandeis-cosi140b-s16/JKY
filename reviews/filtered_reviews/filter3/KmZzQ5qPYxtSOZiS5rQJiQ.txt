This place is a little different than the over half dozen fast casual Mexican style eateries we have to choose from in this area . Salsa Blanca serves your meal on real plates and you sit in a nice dining room so it has the feel of a sit down eatery and this place has delivery service .

As for the food we find it somewhat average and for the most part what we'd expect for this kind of place .

I had the Chicken Taco Salad the meal was served on a large oval plate (not a taco shell? taco salad?) but on the up side the peppers and onions were sauteed not raw so it was more like a fajita salad so I guess that is an upgrade . I also tried a side of guacamole ,it seemed to be made with fresh avocado but it had sour cream mixed into it so for me it wasn't the best but it also wasn't the worst either (I really hate when guacamole is frozen or made with frozen avocado) I confess I was not a fan of the seasoning on this particular chicken in my salad but they offer others .

My husband had a combination plate of three things with rice and beans . This place fresh fries your taco so it is one better for tacos than some places that use the shell out of a box . The chicken in his enchilada looked like white meat shredded he thought his meal was OK . I might also need to note we were checked on several times by many different people....so I can say service is stellar .

We have many similar restaurants in this area and Each one is unique and each one does at least one thing better than the others . For a low cost fast casual meal out it's OK .
