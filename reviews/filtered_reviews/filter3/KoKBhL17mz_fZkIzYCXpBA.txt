Wanted to explore some place new after work tonight, so did a little research (and yelping, of course!) and chose the Round Corner Cantina to satisfy some post work munchies. I had really REALLY high expectations for this place, and while I wouldn't say I was let down, there were a couple things that didn't quite sit right with me, ergo my 3 star rating. 

First, I called earlier this evening to ask a quick question, and not only did no one answer, but their voicemail was full.. not ok for a business in my opinion. Second, when we got there, the bartenders were really super unhelpful. When you first walk in, you step right into the bar area.. it's small, dark, and kinda cramped.. kinda divey, which is not an issue, but if you're unfamiliar with the place, as we were, it can be kinda hard to find your way around.. and when the bartenders offer no help whatsoever, it makes it that much more awkward. So we finally found our way to the back patio, which is really super awesome. We sit down at the bar, only to be told that this bar has just closed.. ugh! So we grab a table, which was fine, just not what we had in mind.  

From that point, the service was prompt and decent. Our server was friendly and helpful, and our food came out super fast. We got the queso as an appetizer and it was AMAZING. Seriously the best queso I've ever had anywhere. So good! I got the Shrimp Tacos as my meal, and they were good.. no super amazing queso, but good. My white sangria was decent. Again, nothing special but I enjoyed it.  

By the time we left, we both agreed that we were happy we tried it and we'll be going back soon I'm sure. I would definitely recommend the back patio, it's a really cool place with a great atmosphere. On a warm summer night, I can imagine that it's the place to be!
