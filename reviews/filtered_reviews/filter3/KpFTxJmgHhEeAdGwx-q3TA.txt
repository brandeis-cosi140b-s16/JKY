It's been awhile since I last ate here.  Not much has changed and that's a good thing.  Shows they're on their game if the crowds keep showing up.  I give 4 stars for vibe and attitude, but only 3 stars on food for taste and presentation (let's call it 3-ish).  I was surprised at the heft of the steak burrito, but was disappointed it was mostly rice and beans.  Where's the beef?  At $12 for a steak burrito, a bag of Tostito's, and a cup of water, I expected higher quality.  

I'm sure I'll be back and try something different.  I know there has to be a better experience than today.
