Since this review was written I have returned to Leticia's and while the food remained delicious, the service is very inconsistent. I've had 5 star service at Leticia's.

Unfortunately, the last time I was there a larger party was seated next to us and we literally did not get any attention from our server again. Someone else dropped our food off at the table and we had to wait several minutes and then chase someone down to get our drinks refilled. Finally, we had to ask a busboy passing by for the check. Even though he had to approach our server in order to get the check, she still did not deliver it to us, apologize for the wait or say goodbye to the table. We were so disappointed.

Although my last experience was extremely bad, we had noticed on previous visits that the service was not always awesome. The failures in service and inconsistency are too much to deal with and I probably won't be returning to Leticia's for some time. I think it is very unfortunate because the food is just so good and we were so excited to find that restaurant nearby. I am updating this review in hopes that the management will realize that great food isn't worth much if it is delivered to the table cold, late and without a drink.
