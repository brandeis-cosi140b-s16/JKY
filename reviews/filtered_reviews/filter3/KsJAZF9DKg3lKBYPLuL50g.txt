Lots of people rave about this place. Even saw the show on tv. So I tried it.

Food was average/below average. Served my dish before others that ordered before me. Though wow that was fast! But then realized why. Ordered the BBQ Pork and Machaca. Both were dry with minimal flavor. The cookie was a nice treat and very tasty. Got the volcano cookie.

Service was good.
Price was high for what they offer. Food above and 2 Coronas = $20
Decor minimal.

Would return with someone that wants to try it but will never have any cravings for Chino Bandido food.
