We chose this place because it was convenient for a Tuesday night show we were seeing at the Luxor.  Hostess reception was beyond rude and completely ridiculous.  There was no wait, but our party went to sit in the bar because we wanted quick service.  After sitting at what we thought was a bar table for about 5 minutes, the long-blond-haired hostess came up to tell us that we were at a dining table and escorted us back to wait for a table (apparently, there are no tables that qualify as "bar seating").  We stood there for another 10 minutes, just to have her take us back to the EXACT SAME TABLE!  She then, literally, tossed our menus on the table and walked away before we had even sat down.  Disbelief is the only word I can use to describe this experience.  Thankfully, our server more than made up for this terrible first impression.  There was good teamwork between him and his busser as they both worked hard to accommodate our need for speedy service.  Food was good, but nothing to get excited about.  We enjoyed the steak quesadilla and steak/bacon tacos.
