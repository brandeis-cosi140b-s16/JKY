The GOOD: reasonable prices for the Las Vegas strip, frozen margaritas look good, relaxed atmosphere, and good for people watching.  The steak nachos portion was very large, and plenty for two people.

The SO SO:  For the steak nachos, the steak was rather chewy, and some pieces had so much gristle that made it not edible.  The cheese on the nachos was OK, but obviously canned processed sauce with plenty of sodium.
