Very "ok" spot to eat while waiting for your Southwest flight in Vegas. Probably a better option than Sbarro, Burger King, Popeye's or Wendy's. At least it is an attempt at "Fresh Mex."

I got the Big Blu Burrito, which was rather small. But the chicken was surprisingly solid. It came filled with the chicken, black beans, rice, lettuce, guac and sour cream.  Buddy got the Chicken Taco Salad and also said it was surprisingly good.

Again, this place isn't great - but it's easily the best option in this part of the airport. 3.25 stars.
