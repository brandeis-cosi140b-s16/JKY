I was reasonably happy with the food here.  Ordered a beef chimichanga with rice and an extra tortilla on the side.  The chimi was just a little dry, with lightly seasoned shredded beef - probably could have used a little more of a kick, but it was ok.  Rice is rice - nothing out of the ordinary there.  The tortilla was piping hot, and was pretty good.  I don't know if it's really the best tortilla in Phoenix like they say, but I wasn't disappointed with it - just a little chewy and had a nice flavor.

Including a drink and tax, it came to about $8.50, which was about right.  Overall, not something I'd go out of my way for, but I think I'd go back if the opportunity arises.  Plus you can get fresh tortillas to go for a good price, so I may just do that next time I'm cooking at home, instead of getting store-bought.
