I ate at this location a few years ago while on business travel and enjoyed the meal.  This visit was somewhat disappointing for me and my family.  I can handle spicy food, but on this day my food was so spicy I was not able to eat it.  I'm the type of person that will never send back my meal, but I will bring it to the attention of my waiter.  The management offered me a free desert for pointing out the issue with their entree. Unfortunately, we won't be back to the Barrio Queen.
