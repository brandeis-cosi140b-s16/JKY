There was no wait, waitresses dress in cute cut-up shirts and most are good-looking, GREAT music, and they have a cool gallery where they have a pic of my fav country singer Toby Keith, I enjoyed that very much. 

Now as for food, the salsa was amazing, I loved it, boyfriend thought it could use more spice. Waitress kept trying to force us to buy drinks, but we didn't want to get too wasted and not be able to go out on the strip late-night so we just ordered waters. As for entrees I ordered the chicken fajitas, they were okay kind of bland and the seasoning had a funny flavor going on. Boyfriend has the carnitas platter and he said it was "better than expected for american mexican food."

The big negative was that our waitress didn't come pick up our check . We waited for about 30mins and ended up giving it to another waitress.

All in all atmosphere was great, food was decent, service wasn't too good, but they do give you a little postcard with your picture on it that you can use for 20%off your next visit which is a nice souvenir.
