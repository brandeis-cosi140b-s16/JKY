The line was an hour long to get our tacos, probably because of EDC. The tacos were decent, but not great, and certainly not worth a 30 minute wait, let alone an hour! Each kind of taco has its own line, so if you want different meats and are by yourself, you're screwed, or even if you have 1 other person with you and want several different meats, you're still screwed.

Also, they put guacamole on the tacos, which drowns out the taste of the tacos. I've been to Mexico many times and they don't do that there. California also has a large Mexican population and they don't do that there, either. Some places put chunks of avocados, but not guacamole.

Maybe these are 4 or 5 star tacos for Nevada, but these are jus average for me. In the SF Bay area tacos are much better.
