Ohhh.  Its 11 am and on my way home and I was down to get some mexican style breakfast.  Ordered the huevos rancheros.  Then was told that breakfast ends at 10:30.  I ordered the chimichanga.  The waitress gave me 2 glasses of soda cause she was worried that it would get busy.  The chimichanga was pretty tasty.  I could have done without the rice.  The best part about this meal was the attentive service from the waitress. Ask for Theresa!!!
