I would actually give this place 3.5 stars. The guacamole was mediocre and shrimp /squid ceviche was way too sour, I wouldn't order that again. I had the cabo azul, which came with chile relleno, enchilada, and side of taco. The dish itself was good, but nothing wowed that I would pay $25 again. You can find something similar at the food truck or a regular mexican restaurant. I mean, the restaurant was beautiful and great services.
