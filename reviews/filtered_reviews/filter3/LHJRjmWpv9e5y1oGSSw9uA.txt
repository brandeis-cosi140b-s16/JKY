I like this place, but my meal wasn't as great as i had hoped.  Margaritas are spot-on.  Vibe is quite quiet and quaint (I've wanted to write that for awhile!).  Very friendly staff.  My bartender/waiter offered several suggestions but I went with the fajitas, which he didn't suggest so maybe I should give myself just 3 stars.  But seriously, a place that calls itself a cantina should have great fajitas, right?  Well, they were good, but not great.   Very good guac, nicely warmed tortillas, but it was hard to find much chicken amidst the mound of peppers and onions, and the sauce it was cooked in was overwhelming.  The taste reminded me of something you would heat up in a frozen fajita kit, not something fresh and authentic.  Additionally, for $18 you would think it would come with rice, beans, cheese, etc.  Nope.

Next time I'll go with the recommendations:  enchiladas, chalupa or stuffed pepper.
