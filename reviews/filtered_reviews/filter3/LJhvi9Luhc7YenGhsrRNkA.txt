My review is based upon two dining experiences with the bartender.

The first time I ordered the Halibut Tacos and they were very tasty.  I enjoyed them and wasn't keen about the Margie I had with it, but it was functional.

The second time I took carry out of the same exact food order and enjoyed it as well.

Not many options in the vicinity so I was happy with it, without having to get back in my car and leave the property.

some guy was playing guitar and singing one night, he was good...
