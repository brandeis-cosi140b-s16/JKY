2.5 stars. The good part: they have an extensive variety of tequilas, the bar is good at making drinks and the ambience and decoration are both really cool. The guacamole and the cajeta crepes were both delicious. The guacamole I thought was very unique, using pomegranate seeds as an ingredient. The tamarind duck and the torta de puerco were ok. The bad: The food is not as authentic as I was expecting or the flavor was not as good. I am talking specifically about the chiles en nogada and the fish tacos. The fish tacos' filling was good but the tortillas didn't look authentic. The ugly: the queso fundido. That is totally not a mexican queso fundido. I don't know what cheese they used but the color and the flavor was totally different.
