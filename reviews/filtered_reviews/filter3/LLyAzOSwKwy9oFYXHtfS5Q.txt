Stopped by here one Friday night around 7pm to celebrate the end of the work week and this place got so many recommendations from friends that we had to give it a try. The wait time for 2 was only about 10 minutes and we were seated in the bar area which was a bit more cramped and loud. My drink of Cabo Azul was great! The tortilla chips and 3 sides of salsa were great. The food we ordered was just ok. Nothing great or super fantastic. I ordered shrimp ceviche and the mexican corn. The bf ordered carne asada enchilada. When the food came out is was almost like we read each others minds. Not very thrilling. I guess we were expecting a big old wow factor of taste. One thing that threw me off was the girl who first took our drink orders. She was under 18 so she couldn't bring me an alcoholic beverage which is what I wanted so there was some mix up with who I was supposed to order the drink from and how it was going to get to my table. My mexican corn was like something that I could make at home. The bf's enchilada and sides were a bit dry and overcooked. I think we will skip Leticia's and stick to the regular places that give us a bit more yay when it comes to the food.
