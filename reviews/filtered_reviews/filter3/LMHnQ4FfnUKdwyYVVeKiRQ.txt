I went on a Thursday night, so it was not very busy. The nachos are amazing! I do not really like cheese, but these nachos were to die for! Other than that the food is just average. The lime cilantro rice tastes exactly like the lime rice at taco bell. The service we had was pretty bad, but the food was cheap and tasty. I would recommend other restaurants on mill ave over this one.
