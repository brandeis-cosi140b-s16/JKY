First time dining at this restaurant. We were greeted and sat at our table quickly. Food was good. Customer service was excellent. I would  recommend trying this place to anyone who is looking for a good Mexican restaurant. 

The only reason I give it 3 stars is because 3 of the people I was with ordered menudo and they were about to bring out our food and said they ran out of menudo.
