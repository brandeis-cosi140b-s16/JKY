What made this place unique over other Mexican Restaurants was that they had a Chips & Salsa Bar with 2 kinds of Chips & like 3 kinds of Salsa, well, we returned tonite to discover that they no longer have the Chips & Salsa Bar anymore! We were very disappointed! They now give you a basket of Chips & the Salsa's at your table. There were 4 of us tonight, so the failrly-small basket of Chips went rather fast, so we asked for a refill which was full of broken chips pieces...Come on, people!  I ordered Fajitas and what came out of the kitchen? ...Flauntas! They apologized, so I ate the broken chip pieces while I waited for my Fajitas. The Fajitas was actually pretty good! ...There was a lot of chicken, green peppers, onions. Comes with sour cream, guacamole, tortillas, & salsa...A bit too salty, but very tasty. We also ordered their House Margaritas which were $6... They were on the small side & a lot of ice...We just missed their Happy Hour which is from 4-7 pm, which they are 1/2 off at $3 instead of $6, so, try to go btwn 4-7 pm.  Makes me kinda sad to say that we proabably won't be rtrng to Silvia's becuz the 'draw' was the Chips & Salsa Bar. Why do things always have to change (for the worse?)  :(
