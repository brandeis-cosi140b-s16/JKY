I was really excited to try this place.  I live in the neighborhood and am dying to have a go-to cheap, fun, Mexican restaurant...but this will not be it.  I love the atmosphere, especially on the patio.  I wish the taste of the food was as good.  

Overall, I found things to be underseasoned, and I am usually the one complaining about saltiness.  We started with the corn dip, which was alright but kind of ruined by the fact that it was lukewarm.  The chips were very fresh and crisp, though.  Then we had one of the poke dishes over rice--very bland.  If you want good poke, go a few blocks down to Hula's.  Then, I had a shrimp taco and a steak taco.  The steak had good flavor when I ate it alone, but the taco wasn't great.  Same with the shrimp taco.  I also taster my friend's pork entree.  He liked it, but, once again, I thought it was bland.  And, yes, I did try adding several of the different sauces that they provided, but I still wasn't crazy about anything.  

I would like to go back to have drinks on the patio, but I'll probably have dinner elsewhere.  Or maybe I'll try the Brussel sprout nachos, which I'm told are very tasty.
