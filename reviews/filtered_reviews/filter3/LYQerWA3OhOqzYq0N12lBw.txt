The concept and decore are something different to offer guest. They use the freshest ingredients possible and the salsa bar gives you access to endless types of different flavors.  I gave Taco y Taco 3 stars.  To my disappointment all 3 items we order were extremely over seasoned with salt. "Guys, let the natural ingredients speak for themself, salt is a flavor enhancer not a DOMINANT flavor." In addition, 80% of the cheese on our carne asada fries was unmelted. I look forward to eating here again in about 6 months. To give them time to workout all the bugs. ALSO, no need to tip they add a service charge to all bills!!!
