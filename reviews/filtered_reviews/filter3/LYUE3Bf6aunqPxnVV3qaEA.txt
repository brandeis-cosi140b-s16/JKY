The building has stand the test of time longer than any business in it's place.  The Stand is the newest food business in this location. Decent.  I ordered a burger and chips w/guac.  The chips were ok, the amount of guac you receive is pretty much a tablespoon.  The burger was similar to what I've had at other burger joints, nothing really stood out.   If The Stand does stand longer than 6 months, than a lot of promotions and superior customer service will be needed to out shine other burger joints.
