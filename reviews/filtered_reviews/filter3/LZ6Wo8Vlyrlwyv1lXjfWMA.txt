Friday evening. The place was busy, crowded, but not as bad as it would get later. We got there about 5 pm. Told it would be a 40 minute wait, but only about 15 in reality. The place is lively and had a good vibe.
Once seated, it took a LONG time to get any service. Eventually our waitress brought menus and took a drink order. Then a long time passed and the chips and salsa showed up. The drinks came later. The margarita (Casa Margarita) was dreadful. The beer warm. After a long wait, she comes back to take a food order. Then another long wait. The food was quite tasty, very fresh and appealing. Much like what you really do get in Mexico City, Oaxaca, and other places south of the border. Tex-Mex it is not. 
The food is good. But it's the service that makes me question whether I'll return. I don't know if there are too few wait people or what, but service was appallingly slow. The waitress, rather than working an area seemed to have tables scattered all over - very inefficient. In addition, she had to bring out a table on wheels and actually stand there and make some guacamole at a table which really slowed her down, and pissed me off because I needed a refill that she couldn't deal with at that time. The management definitely needs to retrain the wait staff, streamline their jobs, and get things moving. This place is a nice change from the tex-mex so common in Gilbert, but if it's going to survive, they need to radically speed up service. 
One last thing: I don't know what it is about restaurant design these days, but this is just another LOUD place. The hard floor makes it noisy and uncomfortable. Several of the newer places in the area suffer from this, like Snooze and Joyride. I get it that concrete is easy to clean and maintain, but it's so noisy. Put some carpeting it and deaden the sound.
