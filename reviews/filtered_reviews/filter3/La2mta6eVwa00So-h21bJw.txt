Came here today with a friend for lunch because she had told me about the mango margarita. We sat at the bar and when we ordered the Mango margarita the bartender said they were "out". I was kinda bummed out and when we asked what other margaritas were good she said she didn't know because she's only 20... Not sure why you would have a bartender who can't taste the drinks. Overall the food and drinks were ok nothing to write home about.
