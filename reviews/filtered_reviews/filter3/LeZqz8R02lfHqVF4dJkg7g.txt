For the money I guess it's pretty good.  Not really identifiable as Mexican food though. When food arrived it was a mystery. Tamale? It's hidden somewhere under the gluggy white sauce. And enchiladas the same but with a strange red sauce. First bite was surprisingly good but then subsequently lost its appeal. I guess I should have had the fried cheese but, did not know until I saw it go out, then read the reviews. Plus side was the super hot servers.
