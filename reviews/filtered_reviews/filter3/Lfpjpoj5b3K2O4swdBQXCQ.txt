I have to say, this place is pretty good. 

One star was knocked off right off the bat because the hostess told my husband to "ditch the drink" before we sat down. Really? Those were her exact words! I seriously take that as an insulting way to ask someone to get rid of their drink. It was a martinellis apple juice too. 

Luckily our visit got better from there after I muttered a bunch of crap under my breath as the hostess walked us to our table. And yes, lady, I WAS talking to YOU. 

I ordered the Alambre tacos. I wouldn't say it was dripping in flavor. I barely tasted the bacon and it would have been much better with some Mexican cheese. My husbands cheese enchiladas on the other hand were delicious. Chips and salsa was pretty good. I always enjoy salsa verde. The house salsa tasted salty. Rice and beans were also pretty standard tasting. Now for the corn on the cob appetizer.....it was so good we contemplated getting one to take back up to our room for later. It was seriously nomzzzzzzzzzz!!!!!

Woulda given this place a better rating had the hostess had a little more class. I understand rules and regulations, but I don't understand asking someone rudely to "ditch the drink". Thank you and good night.
