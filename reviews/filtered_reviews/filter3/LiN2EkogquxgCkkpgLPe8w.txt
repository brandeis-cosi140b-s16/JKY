I visited this restaurant in the Luxor hotel on the strip for lunch during my recent stay in Vegas.  My friend and I decided to sit at the bar to eat and watch the Sunday football game on one of their many tvs.  There was also a live mariachi band who traveled from table to table and all around the perimeter of the bar area taking requests and playing songs for everyone interested.  The menu was quite pricey but the quality of the food was rather good.  I ordered one chicken enchilada a la carte which totaled $8 and my friend ordered a plate of three street tacos for $14.  He recommended the carnitas taco out of all the meat choices.  They also served three different salsas with chips while we waited for our food to arrive which was not long after we ordered.  If you are looking for a quick mexican food stop while browsing the strip, check out this spot.
