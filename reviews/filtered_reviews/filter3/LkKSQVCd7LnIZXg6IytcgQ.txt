I returned here fr a birthday lunch with a co-worker.

I was a bit sad to see the Tuna sandwiches was removed from the menu leaving me with the $13 tuna plate option. It comes with two decently sized Cajun pieces of tuna, on a bed of rice and veggies. I asked for rare and it came medium well however.

There is a new small bites menu for budget conscious lunch crowd.

The validation is no longer of much use, it is just $1 off now.

As allays the chips are great.
