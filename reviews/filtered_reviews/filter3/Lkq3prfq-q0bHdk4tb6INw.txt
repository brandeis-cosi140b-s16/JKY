I really, really, want to give Lindo a better rating but each time there is something that lets me down. 

The food: Awesome. The flavor is great and the menu is vast. You are sure to find something you like here. The chips and salsa are great too. I usually order the chicken or veggie fajitas which are fantastic or the carne asada tostada - love it. They also serve this awesome tomato/garlic soup before dinner. I love it. 

The service: Sub-par. The waiters are always friendly, but they always mess up at least one of the orders. It's frustrating. Not sure if it is the language barrier or what, but without fail, something usually goes wrong. 

The atmosphere: Great views of the strip and Henderson. The downside is they keep it hella loud. On top of the talking, they have live music. Instead of being entertaining, it is mildly annoying if you are sitting around it. 

The parking: On a Friday or Saturday night, there is never enough parking. You either end up walking a bit or parking across the street which is "not allowed"

My recommendation is, if you are going to eat here, go for lunch. The food is worth it, but the noise and service on a weekend is not.
