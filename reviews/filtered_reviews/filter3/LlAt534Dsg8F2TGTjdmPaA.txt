The food here is decent as well as the service. I moved here from Chicago about 8 months ago and I still haven't found a good Mexican restaurant. This place is better than the other Mexican restaurants I've tried so far. However, the food could use a little more flavoring and more juiciness. Hopefully I can find a better Mexican restaurant soon.
