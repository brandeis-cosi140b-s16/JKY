$10 for Carne Asada Nachos. Pretty costly for a fast food type of place and I ONLY wanted Cheese and Meat on it. As if that wasn't easy enough, they Still put sour cream and guacamole on top, which meant more than half of the nachos / meat went untouched / were scraped off. Oh wait $9.50 because they charge 50 cents per card transaction. -.-"
