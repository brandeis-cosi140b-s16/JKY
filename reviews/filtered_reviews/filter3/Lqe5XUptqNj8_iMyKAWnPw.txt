Second time eating here.... the first time was delicious, great service. Tonight was horrible! The server forgot  my beer, the guac tasted weird, took forever for the food, I asked for another napkin and instead of bringing it the lady started stocking glasses at the bar. I got tired of waiting and got up and asked for one myself.... and to top it all off the only time they checked on us was at the very end of the meal! At that point I just asked for the check because I wanted to leave. The only reason why I am giving three stars is because the girl and the food was so good the first time we went. The two guys serving was too worried about the large party next to us and didn't give any thought to my son and I. Would not recommend with service like that. Not sure if we will be back.
