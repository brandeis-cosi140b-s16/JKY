i have to say i really like this place. i wouldnt say its the best place in the world but its solid. i wouldnt necessarily go out of my way to go here but if im at the hardrock its my choice for the places there. the tacos are small though.
the burrito was good, as were the fagitas and the appetizers- i also like that they bring free chips and salsa to the tables. 
the service was also pretty good on both occasions. 
my only complaint in regards to the food is that the rice seemed undercooked or as though it dried out from sitting. (also i dont like there salad- its sweet? and odd)
but hey, im sure some people like the salad so....
all in all a good place for a bite to eat.
