I almost feel peer pressure to give it another star, but it IS just A-OK for me.  Been here a few times, trying to love it more... The tortillas are awesome, and buy as many as you're going to eat w/in a few days... the tortillas aren't full of crap and won't stay soft forever.

But for the rest, it's good or ok.  The Oaxaca burro consist of soft boiled potatoes (was scared it was the home fried kind) and really enjoyed it.  Meh on the enchiladas and the red chili beef's flavors were too muddied... not the bright chili flavor I get elsewhere.

I'd come here whenever I'm looking for Mex in CenPho, but I wouldn't make a point to drive out to it.
