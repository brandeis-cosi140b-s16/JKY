Ever get hungry but don't have a taste for anything in particular? Wanna eat but don't want to cook, drive very far, or wait a long time? This is how we ended up at Macayo Mexican Kitchen. And I must admit, when I left, I was full, so it definitely got the job done, albeit without any fanfare or fuss. 

This place is typical restaurant Mexican...loud tropical-ish decor, standard chips and salsa (which was actually fresh tasting) despite looking like it was out of a jar. I think margaritas are a big part of the draw, but I stuck with Dos Equis. So I got the carne asada burrito, which looked pretty gargantuan, but after I dumped it out of the tortilla it wasn't a ton of meat, quite unlike my friend's carnitas which was a GINORMOUS portion. Either way, the carne asada was tasty and tender, beans and rice that came with were pretty basic but definitely edible, especially when jazzed up with a bit of pico de gallo. The guacamole, was a ginormous portion, more than two piglets could handle and that rarely happens. All in all, this place is good in a pinch, but I wouldn't rush back.
