Went with a friend for a late lunch because we were shopping in the area. Very convenient to a great shopping area (we were hitting up REI and Sur La Table).

Although the location is great, the food was mediocre. We both got the Enchiladas Supreme, which we read were good. Basically, you get two small enchiladas (one chicken, one beef), rice, and a "salad." I put salad in quotation marks because it was basically iceberg lettuce with a little tomato salsa and some shredded cheese sprinkled on top. They could definitely work on making that more of a side dish and not an afterthought. The rice was good though, and there are free chips with salsa, which I thought was the best tasting part of the meal. The lunch was about $10, including tax and tip, so not a bad deal. Since they had good (and free) chips and salsa, I'm giving this place three stars, but probably will not be going back.
