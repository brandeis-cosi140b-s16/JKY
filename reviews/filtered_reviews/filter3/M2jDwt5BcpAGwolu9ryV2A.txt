While I am partial to good hole-in-wall Mexican food, I was pleased to find a nice alternative to tacos and chimichangas.

We sat on the patio, which is a great patio btw, to enjoy the beautiful weather before it's gone.  We ordered (yes, ordered) chips and salsa and guacamole.  They serve two salsas, both green.  The spicier one had the most flavor.  The chunky one was a little bland to me.  I had crab enchiladas in a chipotle sauce.  I asked the server if the chipotle was firey hot since I don't care for that.  She stated the crema it's mixed in cancels out the heat.  Not so, it still had a nice kick.  If you really can't tolerate spicy food, I wouldn't order anything with chipotle, however.  I like that sauteed veggies are an option in addition to the standard beans and rice.  They were fresh and still crisp. My husband had the lamb adobo.  He complained the amount of lamb (it was still on the bone) was insufficient given the bowl of adobo sauce and the price.  We are not exactly light eaters mind you.

While some other Yelpers have noted service issues, we had a fantastic server..pleasant, efficient, attentive without being intrusive.

My complaints.  Offering chips and salsa, yet charging.  Why is it that a $10/plate restaurant offers them complimentary, yet this restaurant charges when their meals are nearly $20?  To me, this is like expecting your customers to pay for their bread basket.  Desserts were lacking.  My husband had the flan.  I'm not a fan, so I didn't try it, but he wasn't overly impressed.  I had the chocolate tamale.  For some reason, I expected it to be a sweet tamale.  Instead, it was just chocolate cake in a husk.  Not bad, but not heavenly either, evidenced by the fact I didn't finish it, a rarity in the dessert world for me.  Other offerings were ice cream and chocolate cream pie.

I'm sure we'll return since it's so close to us, but I'll bring my own chips and a bottle of Pace next time!
