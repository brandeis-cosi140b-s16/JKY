Endless bowl of chips and salsa; too bad the chips were not warm though. We had an early dinner there and just after we seated ourselves, three more parties came in and two of the parties were greeted by name and one of them mentioned that they had coming there for over 20 years while the one of the other parties said they have been going there for years and years. 

Food was yummy, I should have asked for beans, they were especially good!!! 

I used the ladies room before leaving and have to say that they have one of cleaniest restrooms around!!!
