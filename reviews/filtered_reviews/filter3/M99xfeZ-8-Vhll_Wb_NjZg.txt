We love this local Mexican food restaurant. We frequent it often. I struggled between 3 and 4 stars because the food is typically very good. However, on almost every occasion the service is slow and very poor. For my first time ever, on my last visit, I left no tip. Service was just poor. They seem to hire servers either with no experience or servers that no one else would hire. Management needs to step up and train or hire better servers. Or hire better managers. This last experience was also the first time the quality of the food was not up to standard. Keep your food standards high and train your servers.
