Great concept...not so great portion sizes.

I reallly do love tacos from China Poblano but I don't like the prices. $15 for guac? OMG. $14 for Siu Mai? OMG!!!! I don't even remember what I paid for 2 pork belly al Pastors. 

I have eaten her 2x. Once in a hurry before entering Marquee and last  week in no rush for a late lunch. The place was calm and somewhat empty so we got great service. 

Sure they hand make dim sum here but I think they are creating dim sum for elves/fairies! I needed a microscope to see my siu mai. They are packed with flavor but not worth $14 for 6 TINY pieces. 

I think they need to work on their portions and maybe hire some dim sum chefs from the bay area. They are on point with the tacos so I won't ding em there. Just be prepared to pay a pretty penny for food that costs next to nothing at home. 

Vegas tip: Order from the to-go window if you're roaming around the hotel and try the tacos. Don't forget to order a beer!
