Valle Luna is a reasonably reliable Mexican restaurant.  Nothing spectacular, but reliable.  The food is pretty good, the menu has a good variety of "classics" (burros, chimis, fundido, etc), the chips and salsa are fine.  Nothing spectacular. 

Service is reasonable, and the prices aren't bad (especially if you get a coupon which shows up sometimes in those coupon clipper magazines).

Obviously I'm not raving about this place.  I would put it on par with Garcia's or Serrano's.  Not great, but not bad.  Nowhere near the level of someplace like La Tolteca.  But it was closer, I have limited time for lunch, and I had a coupon.

One thing I will say is they support youth athletic programs.  They have numerous plaques displayed of the various teams they have supported.  Girls' soccer, boys' baseball, etc.  A LOT of plaques.  It's cool that Valle Luna takes an interest in their community like that.  Many places don't.  Has nothing to do with the quality of the food, but when choosing between comparable restaurants like Garcia's and Serrano's, I think it is nice to know I am helping support such things with my patronage of the restaurant.
