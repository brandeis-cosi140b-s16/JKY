My boyfriend and I got the fusion burrito and the fusion fries during our visit. He got spicy pork in his burrito and I got pork belly on my fries. For the amount you pay the portion was decent for the fries. They tasted great except I felt like there was barely any pork belly. Also, since pork belly is a bit more expensive than the other meats I expected to receive more. 

My boyfriend enjoyed the burrito and I say it's worth it because it is pretty huge. 

You also get orange slices and fortune cookies at the end of your meal so that's a plus. Overall this place is good.
