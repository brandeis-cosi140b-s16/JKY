I have loved this Mexican restaurant for years but lately the service has been going down hill. Nobody who works there seems to smile. The front desk seems like a group of teenage girls just hanging out not thinking about customer service. I love the Pollo Fundido but last time I went it had dry chicken like it had been cooking since lunch service.  I sure hope they raise their standards back up soon.
