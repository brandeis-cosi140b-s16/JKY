The first couple of times I wasn't too impressed with this place.  When you dine in the seating isn't the most comfortable (I'm a booth kind of girl), and they give you a squeeze bottle of hot sauce for your chips instead of salsa (I'm also a salsa kind of girl).  However, my fiance and I have been ordering take out from here quite a bit lately.  I like the bean and cheese burritos and the tacos., and the little plastic cups of salsa that they give out are super good.  Why they don't just serve that salsa in the restaurant is beyond me.  So, the place has some good staples, but it's a more of a take out kind of place in my opinion.
