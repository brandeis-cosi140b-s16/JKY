Our group has come here a couple of times recently for dinner and drinks.  I'm not a huge fan of the margaritas (the pitchers taste like they're made from a store-bought mixer), and the Mexican food we've had has been decent but not mindblowing (nachos, tacos).  However, Paz really stands out when it comes to environment.  Want to play ping pong?  There are two tables in the room next door!  Feel like looking at art?  There are some really strange paintings hanging around all over the place.  Feel like getting drunk on a patio while attempting to play cornhole?  You're in the right place.

This is a place where you can wander between buildings with a drink in your hand, chatting with friends and playing backyard games.  It's like being at a friend's BBQ.  All they need is a pool.  Unfortunately I've been informed this site is closing, so I'm just crossing my fingers that the business keeps the same atmosphere at their next location.
