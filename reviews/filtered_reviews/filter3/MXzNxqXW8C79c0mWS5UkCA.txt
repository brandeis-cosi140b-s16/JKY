Treasure Island sure does a nice job reeling me in with their complimentary $50 dining credit. Unamused by any other venues in TI, we settled with Isla because 1) we heard they made a mean margarita and 2) they were airing the Giants' playoff game at the bar.

Started off with a complimentary tower of tortilla chips with 3 different salsas, verde being my favorite. Added the chipotle adobo guacamole w/ pumpkin seeds, which was a delightful start to our meal. The flavor was intense, yet refreshing on a hot summer night. I could have kept chowing down on guac for the rest of the evening. Of course, we couldn't leave without trying the masa cakes. My favorite was the beef, but only because the other 2 completely fell apart on me. Least favorite was the queso fundido with chorizo. This was just a hot mess. Thank goodness for extra napkins covering my lap or else my jeggings would have been soaked in grease. The rock shrimp ceviche was a huge disappointment - extremely bland and extra watery. I suppose for a practically free meal, I can't complain too much, but I would not come back out of my own willingness. 

I'll give them kudos for making one hell of a margarita that managed to give my brother a good buzz only after a few sips, which is an accomplishment.
