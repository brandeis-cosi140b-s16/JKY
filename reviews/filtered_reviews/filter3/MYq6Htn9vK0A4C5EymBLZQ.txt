This place has gone downhill. I recently took an out of town visitor here and I was so disappointed. I have always loved their food and the margaritas there. We ordered margaritas this time and we got the upgraded tequila. $18 and they were so sweet we couldn't drink them, I swear there was not a bit of tequila in them. The food was still pretty good, that's why I gave them 3 stars. Last year I would have given them 5, but with expensive bad drinks, it ruined the experience. I don't mind paying for good tequila, but then give it to me. Armando was our waiter, he has served us there several times, he is so nice.
