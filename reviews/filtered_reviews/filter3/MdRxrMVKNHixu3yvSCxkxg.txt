The food here is very good, as are the drinks. I'm a local, who has been here twice, and I really wanted to love this place. Amazingly, there are very few top notch Mexican restaurants in Vegas. This has the potential to be one of them. But there is a serious attitude problem. The concept is to "share" dishes, and all are brought out separately, which would be fine, if you were given plates to "share "your food with others. Other than my immediate family, I'm just not comfortable taking bites off someone else's plate. Trying to get an empty plate here was treated as inconceivable. After finishing 2 orders of tacos, 2 sides, an order of guacamole & chips, our 3rd side still hadn't appeared. When we asked about it, we were told that "things just come out here when they're ready". Call me crazy, but I'm just not into eating corn for dessert. I got the feeling that management just assumes that you are a tourist, and dismisses any concerns as irrelevant. The old adage, to "assume makes an ass out of you & me" seems fit here.
