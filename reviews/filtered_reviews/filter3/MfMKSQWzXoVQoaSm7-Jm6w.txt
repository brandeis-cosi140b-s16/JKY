I was pleasantly surprised by the ambiance this place offered.  Vibrant yet chill and welcoming.  With that said... 

SERVICE:
The service totally ruined the whole experience.  Although we were seated pretty quickly it took ~20 minutes for the waitress to get our drink orders and bring them to us.  We were ready to order our dinner when she took our drink orders but she said she would come back for them.... that was another 10 minutes.  Then, another ~20 minutes for us to get our dinner.  

FOOD:
The Stella Artois that I should have been drinking 10 minutes ago was lukewarm.  I guess I got what I paid for.. it was only $4.
We had their guacamole and ceviche appetizers to start off.  I was very disappointed at the $10 ceviche that compared in size to a scoop of ice cream you would get at a baskin robbins.  
My naco torta was also cold as if it had been sitting around for a while.  I imagine the torta would have been tasty if it came out warm (like my beer). 
What was really upsetting was that the waitress met eyes with me as I was slouched over the table leaning my head on my hand, weak from hunger and she didn't even bothered to check on our orders.  How rude.
My friend had tacos and it wasn't anything special either.  Don't get fooled by the picture.  It's so tiny it's not even worth the $2.  
Did I mention they were out of pork?! C'mon.. at 7pm on a Saturday?!


IMPRESSION:
Slooooow service, average tasting food.
