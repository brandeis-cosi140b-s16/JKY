We only tried the Shrimp Ceviche and weren't impressed. It was such a tiny portion for $11. It really wasn't spicy for having habaneros and it surprised us with the mandarines in the mix. It came with chips and 3 salsas which were really delicious. I probably should have went with the guacamole instead. The hostess never even looked up at us to tell us she'd be with us shortly so we sat ourselves and almost left because the bartender wasn't paying much attention to us either.
