Dropped a star maybe it was just an of day but my food wasn't as good as past experiences. The near was greasy and the rice andbeans seemed kinda old.  The lunch prices are west over priced and the specials are horrible for lunch.  Sandwiches no discounted burritos so my lunch with tip and tax was $17 with only water.
