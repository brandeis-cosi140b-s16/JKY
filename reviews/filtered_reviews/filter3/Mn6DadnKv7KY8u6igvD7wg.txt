It's ok. I think the reviews are a little misleading. I'm a New Yorker that recently moved to PHX. It's not NY quality Asian Fusion but it's not bad. I'm not basing my review on the decor or lack of but on the quality of the food. The Chicken fried rice was bland, they only use very little soy sauce and scallions, nothing else. I was pleasantly surprise to find real pieces of chicken instead of the imitation meat that many Chinese places use. The Jade chicken is very very good. I will definitely come back just for the jade chicken. The jerk chicken was dry, I understand jerk chicken has a dry rub but it's not juicy whatsoever. It feels like it's been re-cooked too many times. The cookies are a nice surprise. The children's menu is priced very low and it's items are not bad. Overall is not NY Asian style fusion but it's not horrible.
