Went to La Condesa around 630PM on a weeknight and drove right by it a couple of times. No lights on outside at all. The parking was kind of scary as well.

On to the food. The Shark Taco was good until I ran into a huge piece that was so tough that I couldn't get my teeth to sink into it.
The carne asada tacos meat was a bit tough and cold.
The pork taco was pretty good and the meat was tender.

The salsa bar was the most interesting and yummy thing in the place. I loved the cilantro salsa the most.

If you go there you may want to pick a time when it's a little more busy. Not sure if my food was at its best since it was just before dinner? Not sure. I will give it another try though. Each taco was about 3.50 each. There are a lot better taco joints in the area though.
