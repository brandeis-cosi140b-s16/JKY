Three taco's for $6, and that's the every day price. ;-)

I've had Two Hippies Beach House about three times now and there's just something about them that doesn't quite sit right. I want to love them for the $6 / three tacos meal, but my GI system seems to say otherwise. I've had different combinations of tacos here with varying success, and since I'm no masochistic I must gracefully withdraw my name from ballot for "Duke of the Beach House." - no write in's, please.

Maybe it's the enourmose portions per taco, or perhaps the combination of spices used when cooking the beef. Maybe it was the rice, or extra sliced jalepenos I always ask for. Either way, the food had a good taste, and a great price, but just doesn't agree with my sensitive 'personality'; I guess. :-/

Alas, I live to fight the good (food) fight in this ever lasting battle.

Happy Yelping Phoenix.
