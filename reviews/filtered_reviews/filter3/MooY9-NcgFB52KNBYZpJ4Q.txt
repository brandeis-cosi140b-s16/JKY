We have eaten here a dozen or so times in the past decade and the food/service has degraded slowly. The last visit (this month) the waiter never once came over to see how the food tasted. The shrimp with guacamole appetizer tasted very good but the design is bad, they have a 2 inch tortilla topped with 1/2 inch of guacamole with a large shrimp on top. You either have to cram the whole thing in your mouth or get avocado all over your fingers trying to bite the thing in half. The chicken sandwich was equally messy trying to eat, way too much melting cheese and sauce dripping all over your hands. Better places to spend $40 on lunch.
