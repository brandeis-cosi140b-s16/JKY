After party hardy drinking at rockhouse, we were having the after drinking junkfood galore carb load cravings, particularly Mexican at that moment...
5 of us decided to go to Diego since that was the closest thing to Mexican in the hotel.

Our server was SO NICE even if some of us were drunk and acting annoying. He made suggestions on what is good and brought everything and more that we needed for the table. 
The tableside made guacamole was delicious as well. We were snacking on the chips with salsa/guac while waiting for our food which took quite awhile...

Their carne asada is the best thing out of all the things we ordered that night.... My boyfriend got some fish dish : seabass and he thorougly enjoyed it but me and my friend thought its texture in our mouth was like mucus cuz it was way too soft...
i got this pork dish which i forgot. It was fork tender and good with the tortillas but not something i would pay $$$ for ...
Its not someplace i would come back to and not worth spending money on unless it was comped like this time. I have a hard time justifying spending $$$ on mexican food.

Some king taco and carne asada super fries wouldve cured that junky mexican craving better, Of course but hey its Vegas!
