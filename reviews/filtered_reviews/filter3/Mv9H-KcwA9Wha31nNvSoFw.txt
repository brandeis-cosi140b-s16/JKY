The only reason I'm giving Pink Taco 3 stars instead of 4 is because of some rude behavior from the staff right before the restaurant opened.

We arrived at 10:58 to find unlocked doors and staff walking around inside. We believed that it was open so we entered. After standing inside waiting to be seated, an employee and supervisor came in from the outside and rudely asked us to leave. I would have no problem with this if they used at least some sort of common respect and tact while asking us to get out 2 minutes before they opened.

The server on the other hand was very helpful and displayed sincere professionalism. The food was pretty good and came in amounts that matched the price - something rare in Vegas. I had the carne asada and was very pleased with it. My girlfriend had a chicken quesadilla and let me tell you, it was STUFFED with chicken. Pretty good. My other 3 friends were content with their meals as well.

An overall good experience with the exception of those two staff members. Maybe it's just me, but as a customer who is about to spend my hard earned money on a meal I expect some form of respect or at the very least common politeness.

If you're staying at the Hard Rock stop by, if not it's nothing special so I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.
