3 stars stands for A-OK, and that's exactly how I feel about El Pollo Supremo, it's A-OK. I love hole in the wall type of joints, especially when it comes to Mexican food. I was expecting to have my mind blown with delicious chicken and carne asada, and while it was good, I didn't think it was as spetacular as others were raving about.

Maybe since we came in here on a Sunday and not during normal lunch hours during a busy lunch work week, maybe the food was sitting out, allowing the chicken to dry out...just perhaps that was the case...but seriously, my chicken was really dry. The carne asada was pretty good and seemed super duper fresh. The beans, tortillas, and pickled onions were all good. Again, the food was okay, but nothing to write home about. 

The service is super friendly. I believe El Pollo Supremo is a cash only place.
