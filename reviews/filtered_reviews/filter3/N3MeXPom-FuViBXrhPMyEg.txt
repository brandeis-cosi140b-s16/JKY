The best way I can describe this place is hip, trendy, and overpriced. I've had lunch here several times. I won't come back again unless the boss is paying; that's a fact. The only parking is public, and you have to pay, so bring your quarters! Let's just break today's experience down step by step:

- Decor. The dining and bar are in one big room with very artsy decor and clever furnishings. The music is a bit loud for business lunches, but adds to the artsy entertainment factor. One of the main attractions used to be the very fit and attractive female bartenders and hostess. It appears they were off today. 

- Service. Standard. Nothing above par. I had to ask for a water refill. 

- Chips and Salsa. One more day, and the store-bought chips will be stale. The salsa was thick and smoky, if you're into that, and I swear they put molasses in it. Not a fan. I like good ol' fashioned salsa picante!

- Passionfruit Margarita. Great flavor, one of many. It was $10. A couple of pitfalls, though. It seemed like a small serving (small mason jar), couldn't taste the alcohol. Also, they fill the glass half full with ice. I get that it's Las Vegas, but c'mon. That is not standard procedure for blended margaritas, muchachos.

- Shrimp Ceviche. This was $12. The shrimp tasted fresh and the side of plantain chips was nice, but again, I felt the portion was small and something was off about the sauce. It tasted too watery and sweet. Needed more cilantro, lemon, and salt.

- Grilled Fish Tacos. This was the highlight of the meal. The yellow tortillas for the street tacos were the perfect consistency, and the fish was very moist and good. With a nice relish garnish. 

- Beans and Rice. Came with the fish tacos. Nothing to brag about. Just standard flavors. Beans were a little bland and the rice a little dry.

That's it. All in with tip and tax, I paid $42 for just lil ol' me. I think if they had lower prices, I wouldn't have an issue about recommending this place. It really is a nice hangout downtown and seems like it has great potential for nightlife, but not on my dime.
