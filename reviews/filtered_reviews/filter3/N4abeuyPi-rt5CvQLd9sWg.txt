I think Tex Tubbs does veggie tacos better than the meat tacos. I had the 2 taco plate today with the Hot Mama (Fried chicken soaked in house made buffalo sauce,
with fresh lettuce, julienned celery, pico de gallo, and sour cream in a handmade corn tortilla) and the Grilled Portabella Mushroom taco (Fresh spinach, roma tomatoes, crumbled goat cheese, toasted pumpkin seeds, and roasted poblano 
sour cream in a handmade corn tortilla.) The Hot Mama was very disappointing. If you love buffalo chicken you should not get this taco. I didn't get any of that hot buffalo flavor at all, mostly celery. And the fried chicken was just so sad. KFC has better fried chicken. This chicken had no flavor at all. I also got a side of the jicama slaw which had very little jicama in it, a couple of slices of mango, but lots of mayo and cabbage. Bland city. Put some caraway seeds in there or something. 

The one thing they did do right was the Portabella taco. The mushroom was marinated and sliced into strips and the goat cheese was tangy and perfect. 

Service was really slow. I walked in by myself around noon today and waited around for five minutes to be seated because no one was watching the front. Also, my server dropped my check off while I was in the middle of eating. Kind of presumptuous and rude. 

In summary, stick with the veggie tacos and stay away from their jicama slaw.
