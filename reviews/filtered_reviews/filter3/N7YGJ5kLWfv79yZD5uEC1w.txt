Service was quick and friendly. Chips, salsa and "slaw" come right away.  I eat Mexican in some of the best places for it, so my rating more a "global" scale. For the Southeast, this place is above average.  First: salsa is ok. Pretty watery but good flavor. Chips seem house made-also good.   The "slaw" is very good. It's basically ceviche with no meat. 

I ordered carnitas. Pork of course-they offer beef and chicken carnitas, which is weird. The portions are very large and come on a huge plate. Rice and beans were as expected (surprisingly they are sub-par at a lot of places-not here). Carnitas normally are hewn from a large roast (can be fried). They serve 1"cubes. Not really traditional. Pretty good flavor, but if you like carnitas, these won't satisfy. Served with pickled onions. Good but odd. Should be lots of fresh onions and cilantro.  Also, there was more slaw, and excellent nopal (cactus) salad. Corn tortillas were store bought, probably all that is avail here.  Guacamole is good, but not enough provided. Overall good, but I would order something different next time
