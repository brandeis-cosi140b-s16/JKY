My girlfriend and I try out new restaurants almost once a week. This one being close to home we thought we'd try it this week, had pretty good reviews. We got to try their famous green chili tamale, it had good flavor but was mostly masa. I had the spinach and almond enchilada and Chile relleno it was good. But the service wasn't very consistant. The waitress was nice and informative about the menu but very slow in coming back to us to take our order and too refill our drinks. But I would try it again because the food was good and they had some different twist to tradition Mexican cuisine.
