Nothing particularly wrong with the food, but the total experience didn't knock my socks off. The guacamole was freshly prepared and quite good as was the chipotle salsa. You need to keep in mind that you're eating at a small plates/tapas style restaurant.  Prices are a bit inflated given this setting. The Siu Mai and vegetable fried rice were delicious, but the tacos were not very impressive. Overall, the price was disproportionate to the overall experience.
