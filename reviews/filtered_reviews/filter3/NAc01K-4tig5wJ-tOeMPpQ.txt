We came to this place on a recommendation from a local, since we're from out of town and were in the mood for some mexican fare. The food was good, I ordered the garlic shrimp which was a house specialty and it was slightly spicy. This place is supposed to be known for spicy food and their salsas are quite spicy. I love spicy food so the hotter, the better. The garlic shrimp was good, but i didn't feel like it was anything to write home about. I also tried the mojito which was also good. They strained the mint leaves out which is kind of nice. We also tried the guacamole which tasted fresh and wen well with the spicy food. The service was fast and prompt. The night we went the place wasn't really busy so it's not like we had to really compete for attention. The decor is casual although they did have a couple of random things on the wall...i think i saw a coyote pelt hanging on the wall but the place is casual so i wasn't bothered by it. Overall it's got decent mexican food at standard prices.
