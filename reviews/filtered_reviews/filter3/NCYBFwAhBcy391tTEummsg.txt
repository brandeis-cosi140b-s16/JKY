We have been coming here for many years, and I think since it has gotten bigger it has gone a bit downhill as far as customer service. We almost always modify our orders, and although they have no problem charging us for it, I don't believe they have gotten the order right once in the past two years. If we ask for the food to be redone, it can be another half hour because they don't make a priority for what they screw up. The food is not consistent in quality, either.

The new, larger seating area is nice.

Some of the staff/owners who work the front are nice, and some are downright rude. They rarely clean the tables all day so bring extra napkins.

The restaurant is very close to where we live, but we have recently been discussing that we need to start going somewhere else.
