This restaurant is not the best. The appearance on the outside is not as good as the inside. The people are very very nice except the one lady in the front :( The food...absolutely disgusting! Nasty tamales, burned meat its just gross. I do admire the free chips and dip though... Their guacamole is the only good thing there... 
Overall, this restaurant is not a good place to eat at all... :(
