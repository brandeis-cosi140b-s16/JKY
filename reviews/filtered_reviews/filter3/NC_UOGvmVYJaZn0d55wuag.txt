Fuzzy's is one of my fav places on Mill. They have a great selection of mexican food at very low prices. Amazing drink specials, really friendly staff, and a great location! I have been here a few times with a friend late on a Fri night when needing something to eat. The service was quick, the food was hot and really really good. It exceeded my expectations. I hope Fuzzy's stays on Mill for years to come.
