Went a few days ago and frankly wasn't impressed.  The nachos were very skimpy on the toppings and on the smaller side for the price.  Service was good though!  I was also surprised that there is a charge for chips and salsa.  This location has been numerous different restaurants over the years and it looks to me like that will continue unfortunately.
