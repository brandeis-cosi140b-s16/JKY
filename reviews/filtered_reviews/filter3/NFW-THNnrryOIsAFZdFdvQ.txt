I'm beyond disappointed in this place. They have an amazing all day happy hour on Sunday, but they've ruined my favorite margarita recently. I love the Sonoran, but now it has lost its sweetness. Our server was all too eager to pull my drink off of the table when we asked for the check(still willing to pay) and kick us out the door. This used to be one of our favorite destinations on a lazy day, but it is most definitely crossed off now. You can't ask what you can do for me if you can't make my favorite margarita the way you made it a few weeks ago then expect me to want to stay. I can get a margarita anywhere. I wanted that specific one from that specific place.
