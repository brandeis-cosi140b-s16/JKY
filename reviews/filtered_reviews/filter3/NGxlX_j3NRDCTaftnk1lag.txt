Tasty margaritas, OK food, average service. 

I have been to Paz a couple times now, a quick walk from where I live. 

The first time, we just had some margaritas late on a Thursday night.  The margaritas are only $3.00 and rather delicious.  That's a definite positive!   The service that evening was just OK. They got us the order in a decent amount of time, and payment was easy. 

Of course, First Fridays are going to be busy. The hostess wasn't exactly friendly but did take our names, and we got in fairly quickly for a busy evening.  The server was slow and unhelpful.   

Food: The food is pretty good, though I should not have ordered the torta.  The chips and salsa are yummy and fresh.  The tacos are usually pretty good.  Again, I love the $3 margaritas. 

Our server was slow and just didn't seem interested in us at all - very apathetic. 

EDIT on restrooms: Per management, there is more than one restroom.  The one restroom is near the bar, but there are others.  The service can be slow too. The ambiance is fun - interesting artwork, a happening place!
