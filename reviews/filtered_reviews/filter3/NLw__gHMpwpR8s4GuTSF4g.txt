We had a 20% coupon for Cabo Wabo, so we came here...but forgot the coupon. Story of my life.

The drinks were good, but too expensive. I paid more here than I normally pay in NYC for a cocktail.

The food was good. Especially liked the salsa, nom. We also came back for brunch, and that menu is good too. Liked the breakfast quesadillas. Also too expensive.

The scene is non-existent. But keep in mind, we were sitting inside because it was a cold night out. Warmer evenings overlooking the Bellagio fountains are probably superb.

Server was super friendly. Gave out a free shot for our birthday girl.

All in all, a good enough spot to eat. Maybe save it for the warmer months.
