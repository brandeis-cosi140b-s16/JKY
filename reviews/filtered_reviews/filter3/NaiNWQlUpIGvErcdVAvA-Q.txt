Solid place, needs to smooth out rough edges. What I mean by that is the wait staff and the blonde woman bartender. But over all, solid guacamole, good food so a must try and see for yourself. 

The atmosphere is trendy/rustic Mexican feel. With a few tv's in the building. A patio for fun in the sun with friends or your pootches.
