Hubby and I went there for lunch. I had the Santa Fe Chicken Sandwich and it was really big and tasty.  My hubby had the pulled pork tacos which were okay. We weren't really impressed with the chili sauces, absolutely no heat considering the place is called Diablos. Hubby had the Cadillac Margarita and I had the Twisted Sister which I really liked. We didn't go for a second round of drinks because they are way over-priced (around 15 bucks per drink). Overall, seems like a fun place for the younger crowd and looks really happening in the evening with cool DJ and lots of shots!
