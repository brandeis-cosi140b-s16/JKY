Still like the one off of Dreamy Draw Dr. near Squaw Peak. This is the second time I've been here and the food just isn't as good. We also had the unfortunate luck of showing up right after a couple big groups so our service suffered as well. 

Floors and tables were less than clean. Not disgusting but you would assume they must have been short staffed and that's why; benefit of the doubt. 

I did my trademark chicken enchilada which was pretty dry and Jen did some dish with chicken stuffed in poblano peppers. She liked it a lot. I also need to give kudos for offering to swap our the standard sides of beans and rice for one of their soups. Very cool. 

Overall was less than impressed and I guess I'm stuck making the 30 min drive to the good Aunt Chelada's versus the five minute one to this location.
