What can I say? Food is good and my server Susanna was excellent. However, this place is fit for the Dodge Viper crowd. Bahda boom bahda bing!!! Just can't stand the attitude from top to bottom. Who needs the attempt at East coast attitude in Phoenix. Too bad because the concept and food is good but the tude is a major turn off. Who needs the aggravation?
