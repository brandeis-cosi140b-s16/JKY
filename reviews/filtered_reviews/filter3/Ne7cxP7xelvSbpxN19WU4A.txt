Went here for lunch today and had a good experience.  I give it three stars for the food quality, flavor, and the details (stocked soda station etc.). The decor was good; however, it would have been better if more time was spent investing in quality food.  I got the shrimp bowl and added pico de gallo, white rice, black beans, and lettuce.  I had the cilantro dressing with it.  There was a fair amount of shrimp which was nice.The thing was, it was the cheap tiny little baby shrimps. I was really disappointed with that since it was the basis of my meal.  The prices were relatively reasonable, but baby shrimp with rice and beans is definitely not worth the eight bucks i paid.  The pico was okay, it didn't have too much flavor.  The soda station was not fully stocked at all which was strange because it was not busy at all.  I liked the bar lay out with the open garage like doors.  Go ahead and give this place a try if you really want, but chiptole or baja fresh are MUCH better tasting and you get way more bang for your buck!!!
