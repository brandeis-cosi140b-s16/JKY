We first went to Chuy's not long after they opened, and perhaps for that reason, were not impressed. It took a while to go back, and it turns out, we just don't seem to be fans of the place.

There is a bit of kitschy appeal to the place, the food definitely takes a backseat to the overall decor. They've done a nice job of revamping the joint so that it looks nothing like Zink - though Zink was actually a pretty decent place (especially that patio!) before.

On the inside, you have trees, and noise and kids and, like others have side, IT IS LOUD. Maybe I'm showing my age more and more, but I could do without all the extra props and noise - I'd much rather have better food instead. What is there is okay, but when you throw everything else into the mix, it's just not worth it.
