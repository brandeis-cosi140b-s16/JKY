I'd rate this  3.5 if half stars were an option. The food is solid and it's certainly better than most burrito options in Charlotte but it's not as good as I was expecting based on the reviews.

You get a lot of food for your money here and for the most part, I enjoyed my burrito. However, I wasn't crazy about a lot of the sauce and salsa options and that's an important part of a burrito. They have several different hot sauces so I was initially pretty excited when I saw the salsa bar but I had trouble finding one I really liked. They all had a strange creamy taste to them and none of them were really spicy. The habanero one is the best (you have to ask for this one) but I've had better habanero sauces before. The spicy chicken on my burrito was fresh tasting and tender but it also was over salted.

In summary, it's a good place to go if you're craving a burrito but I'm not sure it lives up to the five star ratings I keep seeing.
