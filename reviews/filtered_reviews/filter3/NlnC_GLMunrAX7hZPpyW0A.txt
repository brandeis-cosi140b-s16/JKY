3.5 stars.  Nice Mexican place that seems to cater to parties and partiers.  Great big menu full of pictures, tons of cheese on most items, bean dip with the salsas, and micro-brews on site.  Chips and guac were simply standard.  Salsas were standard too.  Bean dip was an interesting touch.  My server was very good...well above average (Ashley).
