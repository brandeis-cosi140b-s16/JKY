Consistently rude service, dirty! dirty! dirty! But....I can't complain about the food.  It's definitely fast food Mexican style...one of those places you just close your eyes and ears and enjoy the tastes.

tip: don't ask for taquitos...even though the place is called los taquitos, they look at you funny if you don't call them rolled tacos!
