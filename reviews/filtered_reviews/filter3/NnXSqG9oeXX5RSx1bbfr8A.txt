My family and I came here on a rainy Monday night. They don't seem to be good with serving large parties (ours was 8 adults and 2 kids). Service was slow. I had a chicken enchilada which was really good but teeny tiny, and a side of beans which were good. My husband had the green steak fry bread and I had a bite and really enjoyed it. I was sitting near the kitchen and I saw the server girl heating the chips up in a microwave and then bringing them to the tables. That was a bit shocking. So, the food was good, but the atmosphere and service was not so good (nor were the chips).
