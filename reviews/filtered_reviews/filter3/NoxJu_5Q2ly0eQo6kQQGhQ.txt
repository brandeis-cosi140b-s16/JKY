I love mexican food. Most of the time this Nandos is good, but the one in Gilbert is much better and much more consistant in the freshness of the food as well as the presentation of the food than the Mesa location.    I do like the staff at the Mesa location, I eat there so much I know them all.   I do wish however, that the consistancy was better and that they would make the chocolate nacho chips FRESH..  They only make them once a week and they are absolutely NASTY by day three but they serve them anyway despite the NUMEROUS times that I have expressed this to the staff in the past.  I will continue to go there because it is close to my house.  The staff and management are nice and acknowledge you when you walk in the door. That is saving them a little bit in this review.   FRESH chocolate nacho chips is all I ask!!!!!
