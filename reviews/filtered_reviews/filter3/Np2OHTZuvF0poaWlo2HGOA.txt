Chips, Salsa and Guac were all awesome. The crispy cod taco was great and the plantain taco's were pretty good. My only complaint was the sweet corn + avocado ceasar was weak on toppings - only trace amounts of corn and cotija, no croutons to be found and barely any dressing. I would also like more agua fresca options (beside hibiscus) and more non ice cream desserts.  I'll be back to try the nachos and a different salad.
