Meh, whatever.

Their food is just OK.  All of their sauces are cooked with flour, so that eliminates most of the dishes I enjoy at a Mexican restaurant and the dishes I have had that don't contain flour are just OK.  I do not enjoy their beans and rice and their prices are pretty high for lunch, around $10/plate.  In summary, a sub-par Mexican spot, like most.
