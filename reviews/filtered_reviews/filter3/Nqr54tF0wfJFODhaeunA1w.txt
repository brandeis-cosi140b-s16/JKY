I don't really know what to say. I ordered a carne asada burrito and it was just ok. The meat didn't have that much flavor and there was nothing else in it- just bland meat and the tortilla. The best part was the tortilla and the red sauce which was actually hot. I love hot sauce that is actually hot! Lol  it's going to be hard for me to eat there again because there wasn't a taste to crave. :(
