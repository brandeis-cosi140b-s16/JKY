We have been here 3 times. Once it was best fajitas ever- second time it was worse ever..third time it was average.
The prices are certainly really great especially if you get the fajitas for two.  Service is friendly and they have plenty of tables so its never going to be that busy in there. Just dont go there expecting the best mexican food you will ever have.
