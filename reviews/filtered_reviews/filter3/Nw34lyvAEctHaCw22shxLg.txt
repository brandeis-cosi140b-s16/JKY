I came here after raving reviews from a coworker. The parking lot was full so I thought I was in for a great experience. Obviously they brought out chips and salsa like any other Mexican food restaurant would. The chips were stale but the salsa was tasty. There was a hot and medium sauce available. The was perfect for me but then again I don't like my salsa too spicy anyway. I also ordered a margarita but when it arrived to the table was definitely under whelmed. It was really small considering the size of margaritas at other Mexican restaurants. Hopefully this was a lunch size special.  For lunch I ordered the chicken chimichanga plate.  I definitely had good flavor.  It was up to par with other Mexican restaurants around the valley. If I were in the area I would eat there again but I wouldn't make a cross town trip just to eat here.
