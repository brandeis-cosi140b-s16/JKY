The food is average. Nothing horrible but nothing outstanding. I had the carne asada salad. Most people wouldn't complain about getting mostly steak in the salad but it was all steak, onions and bell peppers in a crunchy tortilla bowl. Not really a salad to me. The carne asada was pretty tasty though. The free chips and salsa were pretty good.
