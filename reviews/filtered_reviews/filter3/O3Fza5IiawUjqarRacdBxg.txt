Went with friends for lunch last week. I've never been- the atmosphere is fun, the place is huge and has an large outdoor seating area. Its like a Macayos on steroids. Anyway, the food was good, and the service would good also. Except for when my friend wanted a simple substitution. Before we know it, 10 minutes have gone by, I've had an entire conversation about something else with the 3rd person in our party and another staff person was brought over. One of my friends called ordering lunch "negotiating". The poor guy gave up and ordered something else entirely. It was good, it was just a weird experience.
