This place is a mixed bag for me. I want to give this place 2.5 stars so since i cant ill go 3. It reminded me of a chipotle with a trendy dining room. I like chipotle and the flavor of the food was good. So that's a good thing...

The downside was the price. I had a steak burrito with a small drink for nearly $13... that's way to expensive.  Plus the burrito is 1/2 full of rice. I'm sorry but I can get a carne asada from a local taco shack with x2 the meat for 1/2 the price. 

So all in all decent food and very high prices. Will likely just take my business to somewhere I feel I get a better value.
