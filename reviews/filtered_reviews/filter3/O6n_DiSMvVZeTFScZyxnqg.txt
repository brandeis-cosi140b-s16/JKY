I will be straight forward, I am not a Steel Cactus fan. I only return because friends always drag me here. I always order the Dos Equis Amber queso dip, that I absolutely love. I will also usually have a Yinzerita. Beyond that, I'm not convinced. This particular visit, I felt as if my table was an annoyance for the server. I did not have iced water until after my appetizer was served. I had to ask a different server for menu's because mine was not response or anywhere to be found. I always give this place second chances and leave feeling truly disappointed. Great environment but mediocre, at best, entrees.
