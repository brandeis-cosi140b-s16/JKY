Considering this is the last Chevys in the Las Vegas valley I am going to go easy on them. I really like the ambiance of Chevys. Their margaritas are pretty awesome too, especially the Watermelon ones you can get during the summer. 

I like the veggie fajitas. They come out piping hot and the tortillas are always fresh. The chicken chimichanga is really good too, if you like the fried aspect of it. 

However, when you have a special request, your wait staff should not roll their eyes at you and say "yeah, uh, we don't DO that." (Especially when it involves sitting in another area so our young children do not disturb other diners). It's rude. So it would have been 4 stars for the food, but one gets knocked off by the rude and inconsiderate hostess.
