Ok, let me start by saying you don't come here for truly authentic mexican food.  You come here for a sit-down restaurant experience, chips and salsa, 99cent margaritas.  It's just like the big chains in the valley you come to know what to expect with mass production.  So looking at it like that I think they have decent food and big portions.  The service is hit and miss but I've never had a truly bad experience or horrible food, just mediocre.
