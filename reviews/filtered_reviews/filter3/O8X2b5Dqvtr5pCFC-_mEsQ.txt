We decided to have dinner here on a Sunday night with a couple of friends. To say this place was busy would be understatement of the century. Luckily, there is a huge parking lot behind the restaurant itself. The restaurant is actually a lot bigger on the inside than it appears to be from the outside. It appears that this is the spot for celebrating birthdays because once inside, it was nothing but large parties. One con with that is the annoying mariachi band birthday song every 10 minutes.
The staff is friendly even among all of the chaos. It may have just been that particular night, but surrounded by a huge crowd, just sitting in the waiting area was making me feel like I was going to have an anxiety attack. 
We were finally seated and presented with chips along with bean and salsa dips. The chips were fresh and both of the dips were fine. I opted for the carnitas while my husband went with the steak ranchero. My carnitas were cooked well, but had it not been for the additional sauce they would have majorly lacked any flavor. My husband's steak ranchero was just that...a piece of mediocre meat smothered in melted cheese.
I would say in comparison to a place like the Red Iguana in SLC, this place falls way short in therms of "best" Mexican food. 
The prices are decently reasonable relative to the portions, but not necessarily to the quality of the food. With that being said, I'd say it is still one of the better sit down Mexican food option in Vegas.
