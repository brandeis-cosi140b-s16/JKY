The five of us decided to come here for a lunch get together before one of our friend leaves to Hawaii.

Chips and 3 types of salsa:  Man hold up!  Green salsa in my cup!  I usually shy away from green salsa since it is usually tasteless.  Not here...we ask for more.  Green Salsa: 5 stars

Guacamole ($9)-Nothing special.  Just plain guac.  I like guac with sundried tomatoes.  2 stars

Green Corn Tamales ($10)-I thought the tamalito was the bomb, this is super yummy too!  I made this appetizer my entree!!!  It came with a side of sour cream and pico de gallo, but I didn't even need it.  Plain is good for me!!  5 stars!!!

Duo Ceviche ($15)-two types of ceviche, baja and peruvian on one plate, but they share one thing in common...PLAIN.  2 stars

Achiote Chicken Caesar Salad ($15)-chicken was juicy. 3 stars

Spicy Shrimp Tacos ($19)-chipotle shrimp...but my friend expressed that it tasted like butt cheeks.  She hated it.  I tasted it and even though I don't know what butt cheeks taste like, I know that I won't be eating anymore of this shrimp.  She gave it 1 star

Machaca Chilaquiles-brisket, crispy tortilla chips, cheese, eggs, onions, roasted peppers, all mixed together in a pile.  Because this is brunch, my friend got a plate of fresh fruit, cream cheese pastry and a sticky bun. He gave this 5 stars.  I agree.

Service was wonderful, but as you can see, the number of stars given to each particular dish fluctuates.
