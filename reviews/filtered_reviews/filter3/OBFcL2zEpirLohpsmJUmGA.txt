Holy crap this place is pricey!!!  I am not cheap but 12 bucks for a margarita??  Why not have the kick ass margarita at Los dos Molinos for about the same price but really gets you messed up and tastes great!  The food at Cantina Laredo is very expensive too, nothing under 10 bucks WTF?? Anyway they do use quality meats, the chicken & the beef were excellent however the stuff surrounding them was below average. The masa on the tamale was mushy, the tortilla & the sauce on the enchilada was less than desirable. We did enjoy the fajita taco & the chili relleno though.  Due to the many guacamole reviews on here we just had to try it.... Above average I guess but way too limey for my taste.  So for being expensive & not that great of food I probably will not go back, however I must give props to our waitress Jocelyn, she was unbelievable!!!! We have not had exceptional service like that in years, she was so phenomenal we even called the manager over to let him know of our experience!!!  I absolutely would have given this place one or two stars but bumped it up to three because of the service!
