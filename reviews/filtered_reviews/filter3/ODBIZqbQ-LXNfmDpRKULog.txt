I think the daily special - carne asada like- dinner was ok nothing special about it.  The price is right for the food however the drinks were kinda pricey.  A regular margarita tasted nothing like at Lindo M...that was waste of $ however the tall margarita was much better :) A bottle of beer is almost $5 kinda high for this place. The server was friendly and very helpful overall I enjoyed the meal I chose but not the margarita or the price of our bill
