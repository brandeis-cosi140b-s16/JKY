Went with bf on a Wednesday night. Nice location- seems like a very low-key, relaxing kind of place to hang out around. Plus it was nice to get a little out of the city. Couldn't see that much in the dark- we might come back to check out the activities in daylight.
   We were seated in a really nice, cozy, and private booth. The staff (Daniel) was quick to wait on us, friendly, and really good about coming back to check on us frequently even though we were kind of hidden. He was knowledgeable about the foods and able to steer us towards some good choices. I got the beef enchilada and avocado taco combo- both were good. The rice was surprisingly good-I usually just expect the rice to be a bland or badly spiced side, but this was yummy! I actually considered asking for more 
  They didn't have any horchatas, so I also got the Jolly Rancher, which was okay at first but wound up tasting like cough syrup and then the house white zin, which was DISGUSTING- I know house stuff isn't supposed to be the cream of the crop, but at $7 for 1/2 of a small wine glass you expect something you don't have to choke down! This review would've been 4 (maybe even 5) stars if the drinks hadn't been so bad, so my advice is to enjoy the food but steer clear of the drinks!
