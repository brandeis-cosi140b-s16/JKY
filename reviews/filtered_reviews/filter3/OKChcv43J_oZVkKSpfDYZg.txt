We were starved.  The House of Blues had a 2 hour wait, the show for the Lion King was in 1.5 hours, there was no time to waste.  We needed to find food.  Earlier we were walking around the pool area in Mandalay Bay since we were done with the smoke filled casinos.  We needed fresh air.  Good thing we were paying attention because this was where we headed to for dinner.  It was so out of the way that no one would know this existed and we're sure to get a table.

The food was just ok and so was the service. Can't complain again since we didn't have any other place we could go for dinner.
