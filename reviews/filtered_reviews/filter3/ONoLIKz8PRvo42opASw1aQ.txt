Stopped by for a late lunch so we missed the crowd. There were a good amount of cars in the parking lot, but service wasn't bad. Heard terrible things about the place but had to try it for myself. Sat out on the patio under an umbrella. Nice if you don't mind the resident ducks staring you down for chips. They don't bother that much if you don't feed em. Ordered a grande strawberry margarita. Very good. The salsa wasn't anything special but the chips were fresh. Ordered the 2 enchilada plate with rice and beans, one chx one shredded beef. She order a chx burrito. It took longer than we expected to get the food out but was good and filling. Spendy though for 2 plates and 3 grande margaritas ~$70. I'd go back.
