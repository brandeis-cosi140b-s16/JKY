The best part about Taco Guild is the atmosphere. It is a gorgeously restored church with original stained glass pieces and a few newer decor items that pull it together seamlessly. They had a nice beer selection with a few from Cartel Coffee's new brews as well. The downfall was the food. The menu made ordering so exciting, but what came out on the plate did not match up to the description. Everything just tasted so bad. Like very surprisingly bad. It's upsetting because I really wanted to like this place too. 

If I am in the area again I would go back for the beer and some chips and salsa but that's it.
