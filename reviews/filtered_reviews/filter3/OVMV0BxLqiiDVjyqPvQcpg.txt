Disappointing. I wonder If the owners are counting on the success they've had with Stone and Vine to carry them thy these other ventures.  First, this place is much more crowded and doesn't offer a huge selection.  I asked for assistance in deciding on an appetizer so the young girl waiting on us told me her favorite which was the Queso so I ordered it, then had the quesadilla for the main course. I felt like I'd overdosed on chips and cheese - really wish the waitress had steered me in another direction for the appetizer or at least given me a better idea of what it was as it was so similar to my main course. Both were average at best.  My friend and I were talking as we continued to sip our beers but we were pretty much asked to leave to free up the table.  Wouldn't have been so bad if we had been able to continue on to our planned next destination of the yogurt pace next door but we were further disappointed to find it's not there anymore.  Apparently for some as of yet unknown reason they had to suddenly vacate and move elsewhere.  I would not be surprised if another mediocre restaurant pops up in its place.  This may be a case of too much too soon-itis.
