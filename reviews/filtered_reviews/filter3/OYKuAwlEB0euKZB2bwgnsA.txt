Add me to the chorus of people who do not understand the effusive praise this place receives from the majority of Yelp reviewers.

I've been here twice. Both times, the food was solid, but nothing special. I tried the flautas the first time, and a combo plate with chile relleno, cheese enchilada, and beef taco on the second visit. They do give you a lot of food absolutely smothered in cheese, and the prices are moderate. (Doubtful you're getting out of here for under $10/person after tax and tip.) The margaritas are $1.75, but of course very small and full of ice...I wouldn't expect anything different at that price. The horchata is delicious and made with real milk.

So the food is okay, maybe slightly above average. The service seems to be hit-or-miss. The first time I went, I sat at the bar and the service was great and friendly. The second time, however, I brought my girlfriend and we sat at a table. The server couldn't have been much more rude - he was extremely short with us. He basically acted like we were wasting his time and was not friendly at all. The younger guys did come around and keep our chips and salsa well-stocked, but it couldn't make up for the attitude we got from the server in my mind. Maybe he was just having a bad day, but you shouldn't take that out on your customers in any circumstance.

Average food and hit-or-miss service makes Mi Patio a 3-star locale...I really can't imagine rating them any higher.
