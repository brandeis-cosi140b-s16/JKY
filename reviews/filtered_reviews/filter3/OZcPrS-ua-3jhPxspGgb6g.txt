Drove down to check out the tacos here after reading Yelp reviews. I have to admit it was the only place we had tacos while here, so I don't have a reference point beyond what I've had at taquieras in Cincinnati. 

So the place looks intimidating from the outside, but once you step in it is bright, clean. We ordered fish tacos and some chicken tacos to go. I've only ever had fish tacos that used non-breaded or lightly breaded fish - so the heavily breaded fish on the tacos weren't what were expecting. They were still good, but I would have preferred them to be on the lighter side. 

The chicken tacos though were rather bland, the ground chicken that is used didn't really have any flavor. Next time maybe we'll have to try some of the other offerings but what we sampled didn't knock our socks off.
