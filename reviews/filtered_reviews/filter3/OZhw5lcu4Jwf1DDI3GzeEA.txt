Stopped by for lunch with a friend one weekday afternoon. I'd heard him talk about this place a few times as its' close to his office so I had high hopes. It's very latin themed when you walk in, bright and cheery colors. I would describe it as a closer to authentic Chipotle. They have burritos, tacos, enchiladas, etc. and you make your meat selection and choose your sides. I had the taco combo with fire grilled chicken, rice, and beans. My mouth started watering as I saw them hand making the tortillas. I paid for our meals, stopped by the drinks and got some horchata (they're selection of jugos looked great), grabbed a seat and dug in. I really liked the tacos. I've never had Chipotle's tacos but these were a mix between street tacos and your taco bell fare, and I thought they were great. The rice and beans were okay. I wish there was one closer to where I live but I'll definitely return.
