have eaten here twice; once dining in and another, take-away. The dining in experience was decent. Server was good. I wanted shrimp and asked for a recommendation that also had a spicy kick. It was meeeh. About 6 medium shrimp with a cream red sauce that was not as spicy as I had hoped for but remedied that w extra condiment. Certainly wasn't worth the nearly 20 buckaroos. Margaritas were not bad.

Take away got a steak burrito and that was good. 

Have to say it's been a chore finding stand out Mexican in this town, and thought it would be the opposite!
