I've frequented this restaurant many times for work-related, team building-type lunches so the times I've been here are with my co-workers and it's during lunch.  So that means it's super busy cause everyone else is on their lunch and we're all trying to eat lunch within an hour.  With that said, I've always experienced great waiters and waitresses who are aware of the time constraints and manage to get lunch served in a decent amount of time.  

The quality of the food is fair especially since I only order off of the "Lunch" menu.  However, yesterday I realized I hardly got any meat on my plate and a lot of rice and a lot of beans.  Maybe they're trying to cut corners by skimping out on the portions?  Who knows?  But the place is old - needs new furniture, carpet, etc.  With all the new "hipster" places nearby, they really need to step their game up.  Anyway, I heard their happy hours are crackin' so I'm leaving it at 3-stars until I've had a drink or two to sway my opinion to state otherwise!
