The tacos were good,  when they finally arrived. Unfortunately this was 30+ min later on what quickly became a to-go order. I will try them again sometime,  but this place just doesn't have the quick turnaround needed for a weekday lunch. 

There was nowhere to sit and even standing room was  scarse. Tuesdays are $1.75 tacos so everyone was here for lunch. I had to eat in my car =/
