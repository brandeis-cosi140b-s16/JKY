I've been here twice- once inside for dinner, and once outside for drinks/snacks.

The outside experience was much better, but I'll start with the inside.
Inside was too loud, distracting and dark- I couldn't even seem my food! There was an old movie playing on the wall, and it kept distracting me from my conversation. Also I don't like having to sit at a tall bar table when I'm having dinner. 

Outside, last weekend, was good. Drinks came quickly as did food and the service was very attentive. I do feel like the place is pretty overpriced- everything could be dropped a dollar or two and I would probably bump it up another star. Nothing I had (red wine sangria and steak tacos) stood out as wonderful or memorable.

The bar seems to get really crowded, but I really don't think I would enjoy myself there for just drinks, and neither would my wallet.
