I've heard rave reviews for this place. So much so that I would be willing to give this place another try. Perhaps I went too oriental and not enough Mexican, by ordering the Jerk Chicken Fried Rice Combo w/o beans with Jade Red Chicken and BBQ pork. The Jerk Chicken Fried Rice I really liked. The Jade Red Chicken was good but not super amazing. The BBQ pork was just ok. I'd probably go for the burrito or quesadilla next time. The guy giving out samples and our orders was super awesome though. He calls out your name like you're an old friend! Loved that. And let's not forget the free cookie with your meal! What service!
