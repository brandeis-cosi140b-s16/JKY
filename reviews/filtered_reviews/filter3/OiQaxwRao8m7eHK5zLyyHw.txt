Tex Tubbs has gone through some changes - in the back and front of the house, and on their menu. My GF and I have eaten here dozens of times, and continue to go, about once every 4-6 weeks.

Here's what works
- Frito pie. Don't be shy. Order it.
- Three kinds of salsa.
- My favorite tacos are the Backyard BBQ and Southern Comfort. These are new to their "Fancy Tacos" lineup in the last year
- Margaritas. They squeeze fresh limes for these, like their step-brother restaurant, El Dorado. Yum.
- Jicama slaw. Another new'ish addition to the menu. Great side, and doesn't make you wish you'd worn an elastic waistband, like rice and beans do for me.

Here's what doesn't
- Spotty service. That "sit anywhere you want" thing at the front door is still off-putting, even though I know that's the drill. 
- When you do sit down, you may have two or three different people help you. I know this is better than having NO ONE come over to the table, but I frequently find myself saying, "Someone already took our drink order." C'mon, I shouldn't have to direct traffic; I'm here for lunch!

Overall, Madison doesn't have many great Tex-Mex places, so Tubbs is the king of a small hill.
