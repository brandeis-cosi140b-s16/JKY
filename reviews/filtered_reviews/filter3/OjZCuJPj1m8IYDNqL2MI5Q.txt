The only reason this is a three star is that we didn't eat there ... just great Tequila, even better service and a great place to just sit for a bit. 
We got to try a few different kinds of Tequila that we'd never heard of before and the shots were poured just a little heavy. That's the best thing one can do to get me to buy more! 
We will be back and the next time will try something besides the chips and salsa!
