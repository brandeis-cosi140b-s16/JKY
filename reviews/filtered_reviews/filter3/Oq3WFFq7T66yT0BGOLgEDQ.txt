Eh, this place was so unimpressive. The prices were fine since the portions were large.

I had the ahi tuna which was overcooked. *side eye*

We were staying at the Venetian for a bachelorette and sone of the girls decided on this place so I just went along with it....so many other places to eat in Vegas, so bummed we wasted one of our meals here.

The server was very nice and the ambiance was nice, hence the 3 stars. Go somewhere else.
