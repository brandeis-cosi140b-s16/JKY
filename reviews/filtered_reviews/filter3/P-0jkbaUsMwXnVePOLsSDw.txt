After a 6 1/2 hour shopping spree with my sister, we were tired and hungry. We decided to try this place since niether of us had ever been there. The place was clean and comfortable, very cute. The staff was very pleasant and our server was the nicest!! The chips and salsa were very good! Our entree's had a great presentation and was very filling! I had the Dos XX Fish Tacos, with rice and black beans, they were pretty good but not amazing!! My sister has some chicken enchiladas which were yummy. This place is cool, I will have to go back and check out their Happy Hour!! Although, if you are looking for authentic Mexican, this would not be the place.
