I'm from Chicago, used to charbroiled carne asada tacos... Wanted to try something different. Overall, I think it's pretty good here. I liked that I ventured out of my comfort zone & tried "the shanghai" taco- which was pretty good! I also had a fish taco (I thought was ok), carnitas taco (was good, just not what I'm used to) but I really didn't like their carne asada taco. All 4 came on the taco platter with 2 side; I got the black beans (which were bland), and the chips & salsa which was bland as well. 

Recommend: yes, but try to venture out of your expectations & try a unique taco you may not find elsewhere. I guess it's more of a west coast thing I'm not used to in Chicago... But I would try it again. 

PROS: free parking lot, not crowded, unique food, friendly service, unique environment

CONS: it was hard to find because there is no sign overhead to distinguish it from the neighboring businesses in the strip mall, too dark inside to see our food while we ate, kind of shady characters outside on front made me think twice about going in... Looks kind of like a dive bar or biker bar at first glance. 

I saw this initially on Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives

Our total was about $25.00 for two taco platters.
