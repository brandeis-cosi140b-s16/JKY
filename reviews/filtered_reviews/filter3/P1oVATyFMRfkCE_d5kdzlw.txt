Cafe rio is amazing

But this location blows. We both got salads and they didn't put the melted cheese on the tortilla. When we asked about it they said "they don't do that". Hm. Well next time we'll just go to the locations by our house who "do that".

Basically, if your craving cafe rio, don't go to this one.
