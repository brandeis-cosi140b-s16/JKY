I absolutely love nachos and despite some poor reviews, my wife and I decided to go.  My wife ordered a taco trio but I was there for one thing, the nachos.  I almost did the 'create my own' thing but decided to check out their El Traditionale nachos. As I said, I read the other reviews so I was sure to pay attention to everything on these nachos.  Yes, there was a bit of grease on the plate but they are NACHOS, expect it!  The chili was pretty delicious as were the homemade chips.  The big problem with my nachos was the fact that there was little cheese to go with the chili and chips.  I had about ten chips left over with a decent amount of chili on the plate and nary a shred of cheese!  I want my nachos to be loaded with cheese!  These ones weren't.  The taco trio wasn't that great either.  The pork and chicken on them was a bit tough.  I think that Nacho Daddy is more of a place for a Happy Hour but in my opinion, it is not a place for dinner.  They have a fair amount of bottled beers as well as the usual drafts and even Delirium Tremens.  They're Happy Hour specials seem good: half off appetizers and something like $1.50 for a Pabst I think.  If it was for Happy Hour this place would get 4 stars but for dinner, just the 3.
