Our department decided to try this place for dinner after a fun time of bingo. 

The restaurant was filled to the gills with cowboys because of NFR, but they were able to find us a table even though we were an hour early for our reservation. The service was pretty good. Our drinks were refilled often. The food wasn't fantastic, although I didn't have very high expectations of the place. 

The chips and salsa were pretty disappointing. Totally flavorless. Everyone added tapatio to it to for more flavor. I ordered the pork adobo and it was ok. Nothing amazing, but it was edible. I only ate about a quarter of it and didn't feel I had missed anything. The rest of my party was pretty disappointed with their food. They know I Yelp and asked what I would rate the place and each of them gave their own star rating. I have to say most of them said two star, but I give kudos for the good service and since I actually thought my meal was ok. I rounded up for the attentive and accommodating service.
