Finally visited Phat Burrito for lunch and unfortunately, was disappointed.  I hear about this place all the time and my experience eating here was just so-so.  My grilled tilapia salad didn't seem to have much fish but had a lot of rice and beans.  It was served in a grilled flour tortilla that was very thin and dry.  Some friends ordered tacos and they didn't look fantastic either.  I'd take Johnny Burrito over Phat Burrito any day, but I did like the quirky location and decor.
