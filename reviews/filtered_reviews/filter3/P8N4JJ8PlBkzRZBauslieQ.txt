I'm finding as time goes on that I'm becoming more stingy with my stars.  To get that fourth or fifth, the place really has to be special.  While T&T was good, it's wasn't good enough that I'd go back again as my go to place in Las Vegas for Mexican food.

After reading some of the reviews about service we gave them a test and ordered guacamole to start.  Some folks said it never  came but ours came quickly and really was quite good.  I must admit the chef has a heavy hand with the spices.  we ordered medium and if ours was medium, be careful of the hot.  The chips were good, nice and fresh and crunchy.  Two sauces for dipping, a red and a green, both of which were tasty.

My hubby ordered the shredded pork tacos.  You get three mini tacos along with black beans and rice.  Surprisingly the small tacos he got were so stuffed with pork that he couldn't eat all of the third.  He said they were good but not wonderful  I ordered the grilled shrimp tacos which were good but not wonderful and I love shrimp tacos.  I kept expecting regular size taco shells with regular size shrimp but these of course were the small ones and they used the little tiny shrimp.  No way were they grilled, probably saut√©ed in a pan.

We both got margaritas.  I had a skinny one and didn't finish it, tasted horrible.  don't know what they used for mix but it wasn't good.  My husband got a strawberry agave one and he said it was good but not great.  Am thinking unless you ask, you get the low end tequila.

Not much ambiance but that's ok, it's a casino after all.  However, that said when we want Mexican food in Vegas, we'll go back to Border Grill
