Sat at the bar and had great service. The food all lacked flavor which is disappointing bc you expect so much flavor at a Mexican restaurant. We had shrimp fajitas and the shrimp were cooked perfectly but it needed some spice and/or seasoning. Same with the guacamole, no flavor. Good salsa and chips though.
