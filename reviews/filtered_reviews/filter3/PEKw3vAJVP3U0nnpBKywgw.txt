Living in SoCal, I've had my fair share of Mexican food. From Tex-Mex, to hole-in-the wall, to authentic, to fake Mexican-Cali-Fresh. So while in Scottsdale for work, I had to see what they had to offer. Yelped, and found Habanero's. Overall, I have mixed reviews. The chips were gooooood! Not just corn, but different flavored chips. Yummy. I got a side of guac, which I'll pass on next time. TOOOO many onions for me and not enough salt or lime juice. The owner, as others mentioned, was super nice! Cracked jokes, was friendly, very good service. BUT, when it came to the food, ehhh. I hate ordering take-out and having them eff up your order! I ordered 3 tacos: 1 fish, 1 blackened shrimp, and 1 carne asada, requesting them on corn tortillas with no onions, cilantro, or pico, with extra limes. Got them on flour tortillas with cilantro, with 1 small lime wedge. The fish taco was my least fav. Just tasted like frozen battered cod that was seasoned enough. The shrimp was just ok. The carne asada was great. The meat was very tasty. Also got a side of rice. My whole order (including guac, 3 tacos, and rice) came to $11.16. 

Overall, I was disappointed with my food mostly because it wasn't as I ordered it. Lesson learned: check it before you leave if you get it to go. I miiiiiight go back when I'm in town next and give it 1 (only 1!) more chance.
