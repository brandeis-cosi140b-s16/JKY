Great food but the service is horrible. 
The table side guacamole is awesome, especially with the pomegranate in it... Surprisingly ! 
The only downfall to this place is that they are horribly slow and not at all attentive to their tables. We kept running out of water and trying to catch someone's attention was near impossible.
