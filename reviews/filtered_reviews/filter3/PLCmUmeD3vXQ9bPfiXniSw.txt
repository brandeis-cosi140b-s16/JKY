The restaurant decor was cool, our server was very friendly , food was just ok. This place has been built up and talked about so much in this area that we decided to stop on our way through town. My tofu tacos we ok, slightly bland, the refried beans were good. My boyfriend had the Serrano chicken tacos, he said the flavor was also kindof bland and the chicken was dry, his avocado pasta salad was awesome. Maybe because of all the hype surrounding this restaurant we had our hopes too high. We probably won't be back.
