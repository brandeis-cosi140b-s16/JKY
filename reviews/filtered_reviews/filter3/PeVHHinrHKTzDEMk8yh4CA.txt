My visit was on a Wednesday night...the same night they offer fajitas for two for half price, $14.99.  The chicken and steak were not only plenty but very tasty.  The dips served with the nachos are also tasty.  My one complaint were the drinks. We ordered the Sunrise Margarita which is a cobination of Mango and Strawberry.  Although quite tasty is lacked KICK if you know what I mean ;) .
