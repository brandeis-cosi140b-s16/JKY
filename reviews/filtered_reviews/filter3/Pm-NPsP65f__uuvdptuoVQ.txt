Honestly a 3 1/2 star rating. Minus points for hostess stand. Two young girls that seemed like I was burdening them for a table. Other than that service was above average. My son forgot his hat and the waiter ran it back to us. His recommendation of the steak/shrimp speciality was delicious. The steak was cooked perfectly, the shrimp was tasty although one was randomly drenched in salt. Overall 3 1/2 experience.
