The tacos are pretty good. Basic soft tacos. Today i tried the chilaquiles and they were ok. Not the chilaquiles I'm used to. Basically layered tostada shells with chicken and a little sauce in between. The service is very good and all of the servers were very polite and attentive. It's convenient from where I live so will come back.
