Great tasting food. Chef Paco made his rounds greeting guest. That was a plus. I had the posole & my hubby tried the nachos, that were very good. The Flan was excellent. We were looking for an organic non-GMO place to eat other than WF. I gave this a 3 only because my soup had more broth than hominy or pork, small bowl & a little cold. The waitress seemed preoccupied. Plus it's shares same building as a gentleman's club near a shopping center. The crazy thing is they deliver? And It stays open 24hrs!
