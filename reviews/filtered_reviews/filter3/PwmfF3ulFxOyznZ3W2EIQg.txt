This is my youngest son's and his sweetheart's favorite Mexican restaurant. They've been wanting to take me here for years now. Maybe it was best that I waited...

Chips and Salsa (** 1/2) Warm Tortilla Chips. Salsa was watery, and needed a bit of Green Onions!

Queso Fundido (** 1/2 $6.75) Melted Queso Cheese and Chorizo Dip with Pico de Gallo - served with Flour Tortillas. Where was the Chorizo? Saw the remnants... Reddish Oil... must've been the meatless Chorizo. Once I added the Pico de Gallo.... tasted OK. Otherwise the Queso is just not Cheesey enough! Hint to Frank & FIna's... try adding Roasted Chile's to Queso to give it a bite! Or how about some Jalapeno?

Al Pastor Dinner (*** $10.95) Marinated Red Pork. Barbecued Pork... way, way overcooked. Tough and chewy. My son had the Cochinita Pibil... the marinated Pork in that dish was nice and tender and flavorful. What happened to the Al Pastor? Side included a Tortilla cup of Refried Beans and a pile of Mexican Rice, and Flour Tortillas, which did not look home-made despite the claim.

Sangria Carafe (**** $5.50) Bits of Apple and Lime in the Sangria mixture! Highlight of the evening... for me.

Found out tonight that son's fiancee / gf likes Albondigas Soup... she has pretty good taste, Kevin.

Inexpensive, and a very, very popular Mexican restaurant - not one empty seat in the house tonight! It seems, from the entrees I tried tonight, this restaurant is very non-committal in the preparation of their items... maybe trying not to offend anyone?  Maybe, I just ordered the wrong entree! Just do not see the fascination with Frank & Fina's Cocina!
