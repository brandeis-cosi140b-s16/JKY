Hey it was nothing great but the price was right.

The wife and I stopped in here our last night in Vegas.
They were generous with the drinks, giving out a ton of free shots, but the quality of the alcohol is somewhat suspect with me. My gin and tonic tasted like rubbing alcohol and the whiskey sour was very sweet, too sweet. But every bartender makes drinks a bit different.

On the topic of bartenders, the younger guy and girl that were serving were very friendly and even helped me get open bar price (it was an open bar for ladies night). Service was great.

The bar also had an actual dj playing the music which is always a plus.

Overall alcohol was not great, but it was a good time and we would consider going here again if we stayed in the flamingo again.

To all the people going here to eat, what were you thinking?!?
