Dropped in last night at around 6:00pm starving and ready to kill some tacos. I ordered the chicken, pork and fish tacos. They were all okay, with the fish being my least favorite (I think I just prefer mahi or salmon in my tacos). The pork was my favorite, not "blow your mind amazing" but still pretty good. I think the one major criticism I have is that I think they are put together sloppily... meaning that If they put a little more effort into making sure sauce is spread throughout, I think I'd find the food a lot tastier. 
Also, I am NOT a fan of beans and rice being present in my tacos, but that's my problem, next time I will order without. I do like that I didn't feel like a lard ass after eating them (unlike **bertos) which was nice

All in all a good experience. The girl behind the counter was very nice and  it was cool to see desert offerings (brownies and such) in a small place. Echoed from a couple of other reviews, I was surprised at how large the tacos were. For the price, I was expecting street tacos. I took a few bites out of all three and threw the rest out. One would've been plenty for me but then, I don't usually consume a lot of food in one sitting. 
They haven't been open for too long so I'm hoping they work out some of the kinks. I will be back.
