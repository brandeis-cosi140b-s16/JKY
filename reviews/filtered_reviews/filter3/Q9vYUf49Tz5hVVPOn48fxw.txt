So SuperMex changed into Jaliscos. Some things are the same, some are totally different. 

Same: d√©cor, atmosphere, 24 hours, bar, etc. 

Different: menu, you can now order multiple styles of Mexican pizza, the ceviche has lobster, there is a HUGE bowl of very good albondigas, the salsa is spicier, overall, BETTER.

Still just average cuisine, and everyone stomach hurt a bit after. The cheese enchiladas were average. We did not care for the shredded beef. The ceviche was also just ok, it needed more cucumber. The soup and the nachos were the best, which is not saying much for a Mexican place. 

I wish Henderson would step their game up for authentic Mexican food. I know this is a short review but really, there isn't much to say about this place. It is decent, but that's all. Nothing stands out from food to service. I wouldn't doubt another name change is soon to come.
