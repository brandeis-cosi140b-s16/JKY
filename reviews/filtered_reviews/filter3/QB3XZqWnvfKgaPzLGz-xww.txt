Gotta hate on a place that pays for top-o-the-listing spots in our revered database, no? (Check the Three Amigo's pagina, if you no te creo).

I want to. Bad. But I can't, because the food - dressed up, calmed down - is good. Not stellar, not blow-your-tastebuds-out-your-nose amazing, but good. And that's Numero Uno when it comes to restaurant going, at least for this sometimes-angry belly.

I'm sitting there with TRP stuffing gringo-red salsa down my throat (seriously with the tomato paste people? srsly?) and giving the green stuff the skeptic-eye when we get our 1511 Queso - no bacon, but all pineapple-and-onion covered - and damn if I didn't eat 1/3 of this all by myself. Cheez Whip via Mexico City with soft tortillas (as a dipping implement, new to me) and a side of jalapenos. It was sick nasty good, in that secretly-I-eat-Easy-Cheez-outta-the-can way that we do so well in CLT.

It's true there's only two things a veg can eat here, and I went, mehly, with the Taquito - and, once again, decent, deeply flavored, nice texture, plated haphazardly but well. Diff beans than Ms T's, white rice, no guessing at what animal stock you're pretending not to swill. 

Dug the idea of Family-Style Taco Consumption. I'd never seen that.

Would I go back? To stand in line for an hour on a Fri, hell no. But for 7 dolla lunch? You bet.
