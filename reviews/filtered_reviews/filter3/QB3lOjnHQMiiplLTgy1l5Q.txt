Went here to take my mom to lunch, just curious to try another tex mex restaurant...service was prompt, a bit slow but our service was nice and the complimentary chips/salsa was great. The food was good, not something to go crazy about, my fish tacos were yum but I dunno why they couldn't serve it 1 grilled & 1 beer battered, it has to be either one :-/  but yeah, prices are little high but overall it was ok.
