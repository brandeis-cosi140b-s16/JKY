I live and work in an area with a high density Hispanic community.  We have really good Mexican and South American restaurants.  This place had good chips and very good salsa, the street tacos were just ok.  It was way over priced, $20 for three small tacos with beans and rice....outrageous, at least double what I am used to.  I gave it 3 stars because the food was average, I would give it 2 stars because it was overpriced for the meal in total.
