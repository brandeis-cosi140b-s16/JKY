I think this place is better than people make it out to be!

Great prices, good food, great music videos being played in the background, and a good crowd.

While the chips and the fajitas were average or above average, the best part is requesting all the hot sauce accompaniments they have available.  I would recommend the Habanero sauce if you like spicy food, it is good on everything!

This is a great staging spot to have a little dinner and have a couple drinks before heading out for the night.  I will be a regular here.
