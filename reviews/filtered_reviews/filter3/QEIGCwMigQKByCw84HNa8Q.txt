Get their Crispy Rock Shrimp Tacos (with Mexican slaw & spicy chipotle sauce)!  I ordered it because it was recommended by the waitress, which I agree with.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly, and the the spicy chipotle sauce goes well with the guacamole & salsa.  YUM!

I also got their mojito... meh.  They muddled the mint more as I had requested.  I wished they put more lime in... this drink tasted like enhanced water.  Too light for my tastes.  Felt a little bit ripped off - the drink was $9!
