If you lower your expectations, it is not a bad strip mall mexcian fast food joint. It is just not all that good either. Guy at the counter was friendly and brought us a water with our soda. Nice of him to go out of his way for us. Just hoped for more flvor in food. The rice and beans were cold so that food not help. NOT a 4.5 star Yelp place but better than a two star-barely.
