I was excited to try this place due to the reviews. I left disappointed feeling the experience was a bit above average, at best. It started off well with a tasty appetizer sampler and flavorful salsa with chips but it quickly went downhill when the entree arrived. The carnitas I ordered were dry, obviously not very fresh. The sauce had a nice unique flavor, very mole-esque but I did not enjoy it due to the shoe leather meat. The corn tortillas that came with the carnitas were borderline brittle, not moist and soft as they should be. The beans and rice were good and my wife raved about the flan. I opted to pass on dessert. The ambiance was very inviting and put together with the standard Mexican restaurant decor. Everything considered, I don't think I will back. There are plenty of Mexican restaurants much closer to me where the food is at least equal to or better than The Original Garcia's.
