The Chips and guacamole were good.  My wife had a vegetarian enchilada that was really tasty.  I had the steak fajitas and they were fairly bland. The service was good. 

The dinner wasn't bad it just isn't what we expect out of a nicer place in vegas.  Every place we eat at the Venetian is excellent but Canonita was just ok.
