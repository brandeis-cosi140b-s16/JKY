I didn't check the reviews before eating here, so I was a little worried once we sat down and started checking out the reviews. We decided to stick around anyway.

The menu wasn't great, it was extremely loud, and the service was incredibly slow. So, I see why people have been disappointed.

Going into it expecting the norm for a restaurant on the strip is going to be over priced, with underwhelming food and service, will help keep this in perspective while dining here.
