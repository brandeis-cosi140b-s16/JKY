The food is ok. I really liked my carne asada taco, but not the adobada one. The adobada had a lot of chopped pineapple and tasted more like a pineapple taco. To add to that, the white corn tortillas were not good at all. In my opinion, you can't have a good taco without a decent tortilla!

I didn't mind paying 4 dollars for a taco since they were served well. The one thing that did upset me was the they charged $.30 per taco to hold the beans (we paid for a large party so the $.30 per taco really added up!). I am used to being charged for adding toppings, but to charge me for taking stuff off, now that's just crazy! Thanks to your miser ways, we won't be going back anytime soon.

I prefer Tacos El Gordo anyway, which is right next door. Where you can customize your tacos and don't get nickled and dimed for getting what you like.
