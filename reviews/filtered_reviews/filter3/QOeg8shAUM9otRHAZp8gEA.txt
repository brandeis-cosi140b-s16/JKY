This place has wonderful reviews from their loyal customers. I'd like to appreciate this place for what it is. So what is it? This is a restaurant that has been serving this area of Henderson since dinosaurs roamed the Earth. Every older neighbor in my part of Water Street District has raved about them. So they're an integrated part of society here. They serve solidly average Mexican food. It's probably gone downhill a little on quality. The decor is funky. The wait-staff is generally personable. 

My salad, as another person has described on a review, was filled with water, small, and straight out of a bag with some cheese on it. It's ok - it's Mexican food. I don't think Robertos even HAS a salad. I shouldn't really be expecting an amazing salad if I am trying to order authentic Mexican food. 

My beans were so-so. They kind of tasted ... old. My rice was dry and flavorless. Our table wobbled. 

So why even give them three stars? My chimichanga was AWESOME. I got it smothered in red sauce, and the result was something that I can't begin to describe. I never like red sauce. I absolutely abstain from ordering enchiladas at Mexican restaurants because I hate that sauce so much. I've only ever liked it at one place, in California. But I took a gamble and I adored it. 

So did my husband. And he's picky. Way-picky. The kind of picky that won't try new places with me unless I beg or threaten bodily harm. The kind of picky that requires us to end up picking up pizza after we eat at a friends' house if they're serving something he doesn't like. The kind of picky that always orders the same thing wherever he goes. He said it was the second best enchilada sauce he's ever had. (Next to mine, of course.) For him to say that means I would take him back here simply for enchiladas. That is why they get three stars. They will have my business simply because they do one super-important thing better than anywhere else. You can't knock that.
