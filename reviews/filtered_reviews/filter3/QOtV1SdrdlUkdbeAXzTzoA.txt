I came here on a Saturday for lunch and it was packed so we took our food to go. By the time I was able to eat my torta ahogada, it had already soaked up all the spicy sauce it was swimming in and was soggy and quickly disintegrating. Normally I'm pretty tolerant to spicy foods but all I could taste was spicy. My friend got 3 fish tacos, which were super tiny. He was still hungry afterwards so he had san other full meal. Overall, it did not live up to all the good reviews I kept reading about on Yelp.
