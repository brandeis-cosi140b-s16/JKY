So far I have frequented Madmex in greentree /shadyside and now monroeville. Each one I had something a little different so the kudos and misses will vary just a heads up.

Greentree had the best stocked bar in pittsburgh I heart anyplace which stocks Absolut Pear... Mango or Acai Berry Ive been to Bars here who couldnt stock any of these so A++ for booze at this location. Here they had all three.

Shadyside the Margaritas were so yummy and so were the buffalo wings I was in heaven. Though be careful ordering the expensive bigass one with the sidecar extra shot thing....... creepy little bugger makes for a big buzz later :)

I tried the pork Carnitas burrito at Monroeville, along with chips and salsa. Here i cried for the authentic mexican of the southwest I truly miss, because the carnitas were so bland, the rice was white (ew) spanish please, and there weren't really any beans or corn in the burrito. Suffice to say Chipotle makes a better carnitas pork burrito for the same price or less. Also my 12 oz margarita was super tart and boozey.

Salsa the chipotle and the blk bean were yumm, the nacho cheese was gross but ive never been a fan of that. I would read some more yelp reviews before ordering here again or maybe just go here for drinks and apps.
