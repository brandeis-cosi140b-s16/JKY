I wish the chips were endless and free. Their salsa also leaves something to be desired. The portions are large and pricey. Nothing amazing for Mexican food here. I had the chicken enchiladas and had some of my friend's sampler platter and it was unremarkable, yet extremely filling. I didn't feel well for up to 30 mins after.
