Saturday night....We had a party of about 9 and we were seated very quickly. Love the thick tortilla chips. Waiter was very nice and split the checks for us without even being asked. Food was good... Nothing mind blowing but was average... Good. The bathroom needs remodeled and is very creepy and outside??
