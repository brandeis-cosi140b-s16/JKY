Came here today on the recommendation of Dee at the wallpaper market, located across the street, inside Creative Home Fabrics. (Little shout out there for Dee's business)  Dee says she gets so hungry when she comes in early because the delicious smell of fresh grilling meat is overwhelming.  I went, ordered lunch to go. It was good.  Steak quesadilla was soaking in grease . I had to take a napkin and soak up the grease.  I ordered 3 steak tacos, and 3 chicken tacos. Good. Had to add a lot of salt and pepper to really enjoy them. The crazy potato with steak was good. I love that they have coke products, styrofoam cups and pellet ice. 

Love the cucumbers at salsa bar. 

The place is darling. Very very clean, was PACKED at 12:30pm.  Lots of clean cut business people and elders  ( missionaries) eating here.  It had a really nice " boutique-ee feel to it. 


The background story is cute and inspiring. 

The food was good and the place cute and really clean. . I would not drive out of my way to eat here, but would definitely return if I happen to be in the area.
