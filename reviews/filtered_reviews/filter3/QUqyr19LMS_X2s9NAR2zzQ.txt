I love seeing a local business have the seemingly sudden success that America's has had, and I don't want to be "that guy", but... I mean, can we all just admit that America's, on the whole, is just OK? Over-hyping breeds disappointment.

This is one of the original America's, and I remember portions bigger and prices smaller, but maybe that is just the curse of nostalgia. I do appreciate that the menu has expanded a bit.

Cochata (iced coffee and horchata) - yum
Bean and cheese burrito - yum
Salsa - meh
Breakfast burrito - yum-to-meh.
Service - yuck

Getting just a bean burrito, chips, and a soda is pretty pricey, for such a basic meal and such a casual setting.

I've had some not so good recent experiences with service and getting orders wrong at this location, so I haven't been back for a while. Usually it's fixable and they're courteous yet brusque, but this vegetarian is very disappointed when her on-the-go breakfast burrito has chorizo in it... contrary to her special request. I do appreciate the lard-free beans.

Also, as a resident of the neighborhood directly behind this location, parking is totally a bummer during peak hours (and not peak hours, for that matter). There are about 5 spots in the America's lot, then it's nothing but neighborhood parking. Most residents are used to strange cars of restaurant customers parked in front of their houses, but just be mindful. Bring your patience and you'll be fine.
