This place is in a great location and sweet patio. Great place for people watching also.

The food was very average. Tried 3 different tacos and though the mahi mahi was the best. Had the nachoes and again very average. Cheese was extremely thick and random clumps of taco seasoned ground beef in there. 

Service was average to good. The college-aged girls working there were friendly, attentative. Waitress did forget an order, but nice about it.
