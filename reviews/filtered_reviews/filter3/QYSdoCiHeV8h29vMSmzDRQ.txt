It's pretty good but a little pricey for what you get..the tacos are really small!  Good flavor..I had carne asada tacos..u get 4 small tacos..very tasteful but tiny..finished dish in like 2 minutes!  The Jamaica Margarita was pretty good but also small..it had Gran Mariner in it which was a nice kick! ($13)..another thing is that the server barely payed attention to us and was only looking after the larger tables.
