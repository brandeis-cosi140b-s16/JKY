I recommend coming here specifically for happy hour. They have decent offerings, half priced apps and drink specials every day of the week. I wouldn't say the food is anything to write home about, but I've not had a bad experience here either. I've only had the apps so will comment on those. The shrimp ceviche isn't the authentic mexican or peruvian quality, but it is passable. Can't go wrong with the guac and chips and would recommend those for sure, the spicier version has jalapenos in it.  Queso dip is pretty standard but satisfies the crave. The rooftop is pleasant when the weather's nice. It's in a great location, so it's convenient for a quick or casual bite, from which you can move onto your next great adventure. It's a great meeting place, accomodates large groups, and I always see the after work crowd there to unwind. Overall, I feel like the food is in the same range as a Chili's or Applebee's, but given the vibe and location of the place, it feels like a step above.
