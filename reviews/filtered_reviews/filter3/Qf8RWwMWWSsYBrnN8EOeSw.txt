Cool little taco shop in a questionable part of town.  we went early and the place was dead. The waitress was very nice and helpful even going in to the kitchen to get us samples of the meats they offer.  The salsa bar was huge with lots of interesting choices, nothing rocked my world but the cilantro cream was tasty.  we ordered a variety of items, my least favorite being the quesadilla, just tasted like fried greasy tortilla couldn't get past it to eat more than a bite or two.  the tacos were good I had the shark and hubby had the pork it was his favorite. we had a carne asada burrito as well and the meat was tasty.  It was good not great but I think we will be back to try it again.
