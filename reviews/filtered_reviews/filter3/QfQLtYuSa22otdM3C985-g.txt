As people said, there are separate lines for each kind of taco. My go to taco is usually the lengua. Some people are uncomfortable eating tongue, but honestly it's some of the most tender meat possible. 

Unfortunately I was little underwhelmed by the lengua here. The meat wasn't as savory as I've had at other places.

Looking at the reviews, I guess I should have tried the pork. Maybe next time...
