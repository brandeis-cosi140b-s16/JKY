Been here a few times as it is close to my work, and their happy hour is not disappointing. Margaritas are under $5 and many appetizers and small plates are also discounted. I love their salsas. The warm red one is good, but the green is my fave. Their crab cakes with the corn sauce are darned tasty. The guac is good and my friends like the tacos here. They were pretty busy on a Friday at 530, so be prepared to wait for a table, even for just two ppl. There was also live music, which was so loud, it would have been impossible to have a conversation if we'd Sat in the bar.
