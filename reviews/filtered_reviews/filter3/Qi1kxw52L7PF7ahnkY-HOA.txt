A few bucks can go a long way. Always tip the people who serve you. 

We sat at the bar and ordered guac & chips ... Little did we know it was made table side which is incredibly inconvenient to the bar tender but the manager came to help out, we tipped him a few dollars - he acted like he'd never seen money before! So after that the manager got us a few more 2 or 1 beers (happy hour had been over for a half hour already).  

We also ordered the quesadillas and they were really good. 

Sit outside, the barstools are super fun. Plus there's a DJ playing good tunes.... The servers come out and dance to certain songs and get customers involved. 

Overall I liked the place.
