The food is 5 stars the service is 2 at best if even that.  We had Greg as our waiter and he was more interested in talking with the hostess and looking at girls walking through the parking lot versus taking care of our table.

Examples:  chip basket was empty he passed by twice and finally the 3rd time I had to stop him and ask.....ice tea glass empty for well over 5 minutes twice...just sitting at the table and waiting and waiting....
