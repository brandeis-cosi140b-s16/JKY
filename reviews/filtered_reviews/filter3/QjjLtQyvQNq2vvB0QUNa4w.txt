This place was conveniently located in Treasure Island. Nice atmosphere. Has that tropical island feel to it. I came most days because I had coupons for 2 for 1 drinks. 

However, the service was lousy. But with their drinks normally costing $12.50 a piece.... The coupons came in handy. 

I was never offered a menu at any of the times so I wouldn't know about the food. I'm surprised they didn't want to serve food........
