My and the BF were hungry and didn't feel like making the trek out of our hotel so we hit this place up.  I have to say that whoever designed the menu totally catered to my flavor profile.... SALT and LIME.  No it's not very sophisticated, but I love it.  I ordered the tortilla soup and a chicken burrito.  Also we ordered a queso appetizer.  The Queso was lame honestly... they meant well, but after like 3 minutes it hardens and is no good.  The soup and burrito were SOOOOOO good!  I was a happy camper.  My bf ordered the falafel tacos.  Basically he said that they weren't that great for him, but he understood the concept.  If I'm back to the Luxor again I'll hit this place up.
