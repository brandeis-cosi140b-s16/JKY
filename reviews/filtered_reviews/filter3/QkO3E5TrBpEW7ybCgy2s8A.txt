I got the bowl with the pig and chicken. Its pretty good and they put a lot! I couldn't even finish it. I like their mango sauce and papaya sauce and you guys should try it if you like your food sweet and fruity! They also give you a plate to try the meat. 

I didn't like how they only have brown rice but it was really good since it tasted home made
