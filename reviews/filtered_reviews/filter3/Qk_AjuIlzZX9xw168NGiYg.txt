One thing will definitely steal the show of my review: when we were at Maverick, the guy sitting at the table next to us tried the 5 lb. burrito challenge. We basically couldn't focus on anything else. It was HUGE and just thinking back on it makes me a little queasy. Props to that man, though. He won and got a t-shirt (you only get a t-shirt and a little name recognition? Ouch). 

Anyway, the food was perfectly fine. We enjoyed watching football on the multiple tvs and the atmosphere was spot on. Maybe it was the shoes I was wearing, but damn. Those floors are slippery. Be careful on your way to the bathroom, especially if you've had a margarita or two.
