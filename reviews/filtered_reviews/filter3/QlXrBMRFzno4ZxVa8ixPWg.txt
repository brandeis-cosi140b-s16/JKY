My cousin raves about this place so we finally came to check it out. It is a cute little restaurant. Chips and salsa are good...but I mean how can any mexican restaurant get that part wrong right?
I decided to get a bean and cheese burrito enchilada style and a cup of fideo soup. The enchilada sauce was ok. Definitely have had better. The bean's and rice were flavored nicely.The soup lacked flavor and was oily. Not my favorite. I also got horchata ( I always have to order it at every mexican restaurant I go too) it was good but extremely sweet. Like it had either been sitting too long or hasn't been stirred. We shared fried ice cream. Which was also delicious no complaints there.
Overall it was satisfying but probably not my top pick to come eat when I am craving mexican food. 
The prices aren't bad eitheer and they have a nice selection for their lunch menu.
