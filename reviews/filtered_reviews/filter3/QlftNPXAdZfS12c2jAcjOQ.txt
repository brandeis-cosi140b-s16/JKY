Based on the rave reviews, we went to Blue Adobe last night. The service was excellent, the wine list fine, and the food was good. However the salad was drowning in dressing (order it on the side) and I expected a lighter touch to the food. We ate outside on a lovely evening. I am still searching for that spot where I can eat a nice meal while watching the sun set over the distant mountains.....
