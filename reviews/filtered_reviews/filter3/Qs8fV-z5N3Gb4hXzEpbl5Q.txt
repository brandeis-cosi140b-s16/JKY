This place is not a good value at all. We were seated relatively fast and it was packed during Father's Day. The food came quickly enough for us not to worry about it. I ordered a burrito but did not come with a side of anything. The burrito was ok, but I feel like I could have had a better burrito at a local taco shop. For the price we paid it did not feel worth it. Not coming back to this place any time soon.
