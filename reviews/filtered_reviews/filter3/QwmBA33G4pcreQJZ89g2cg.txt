The food is always great,  I have been here maybe 5 times and only one of those times were we waited on in a timely manner.  They drop the menu off and then go away for at least 10-15 minutes.  For some reason the wait staff refuses to write down any orders.  I'd rather they write them down instead of getting them wrong. The lack of staff is the downfall of this place.  Can't deny the meat and the food is fantastic.
