The food is pretty tasty, but expensive compared with similar food in Mesa area.  The margaritas are way too expensive.  They have a happy hour BUT only in the bar.  I just don't understand why restaurants don't extend happy hours to ANY of their eating establishment locations.  They ARE trying to attract business aren't they?  I've NEVER seen a 'special' price on anything at Nandos. Even though food is good, I'll probably go elsewhere due to excessive cost.
