I ate dinner here on September 27, 2008. I had heard about the restaurant from my boss, who said it was a must-visit during my trip (he'd only been to the Santa Monica restaurant).

Great service.

Food was ok. My boyfriend and I had eaten lunch at the Bellagio Buffet earlier in the day so we didn't get into the restaurant until around 10pm. Neither of us was very hungry, but we did need to eat something.

We got guacamole for an appetizer. For the amount of guac, the appetizer was fairly overpriced. I've also made guacamole at home that was better than this stuff.

My boyfriend got a quesadilla off of the appetizers section, which had chicken and several Mexican cheeses in it. He thought it was delicious.

I got the watercress, avocado, and orange salad. I don't eat meat, and so my boyfriend ate the bacon off of the dates so that I could include them in the salad's taste profile (even though the bacon taste lingered...). I blame myself for completely not noticing that there was bacon in the description... so no blame with the server or kitchen there.

The dressing was wayyyyy thick in the salad, to the point where I asked if they could make me a new one with dressing on the side. The dressing was also a very weird flavor profile. Lots of black pepper and sour/saltiness that just sort of overwhelmed everything else in the bite. I didn't even taste coriander, just sour/salty/peppery grossness.

The server was very accommodating about the dressing, and had a new salad ready pretty fast.

I had a delicious coconut lemonade, which was the highlight of the meal for me. My boyfriend had a watermelon mojito, which was ok, but he commented that the fresh mint was strangely overpowering the watermelon flavor, which he wasn't sure combined well with the mint.

We also had the Tres Leches cake boxed up for us so we could eat it later, and it was delicious.
