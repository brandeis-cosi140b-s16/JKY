Friday night was my 1st trip here. I'll be honest, it didn't start out well. There were open tables all over the restaurant and multiple groups standing at the door and the hostesses were not exactly in a hurry to get anyone sat. They kept walking back and forth from the host stand not really doing anything. If there ever was a reason to use words like "mosey" or "aloof", these girls would be it. 
The wait staff was super nice so that kind of made up for it. The food was very good and they weren't stingy with my margarita, although my friend ordered a beer and the glass wasn't filled to the top. 
Long and short, The food was worth giving it a second chance on a week night.
