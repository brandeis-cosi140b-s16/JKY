Steel Cactus is fun. It's a fun restaurant / bar.  I enjoy myself here, but it isn't a place to eat or drink.

The crowd is great. The bar staff is great. The basic drinks are well made.

The food is alright. It is definitely better than suburb Mexican, but I'd prefer Round Corner when it comes to food.

The cocktails are boring. Mad Mex does a better basic volume margarita. Round Corner has a better margarita selection.  Steel Cactus doesn't have any Mezcal.

Overall, Steel Cactus is fun. That is why I go.
