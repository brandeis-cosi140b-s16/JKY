I've only had breakfast burritos here and they are amazing.  The best!  However if you're looking for good service do not come here.  The people at the register do not greet you and seem annoyed to have to take your order.  I've had my order messed up a few times which isn't a big deal but they always seem like I've asked for something unheard of because they need to fix my order.  Check your order before you leave and don't expect friendly service to go along with the great food here.
