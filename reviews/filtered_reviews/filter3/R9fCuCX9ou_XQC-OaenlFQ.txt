I debated if I should even review this mediocre experience. The reviews make it sound like its a hidden gem, of quality and quantity in the lost art of Mexican cuisine. I found it very bland. It did fill the purpose for which I came here, but compared to some awesome Mexican food that I have had in this so-close-to-Mexico-state - this place was far from note worthy.

It's not expensive, which is the factor that saves this place - but I find the fast food angle of Mexican food incredibly tacky. And the seating arrangement is purposely very small. It is clear that the model is enter-pay-eat-gtfo, and I have no issue with that - but I don't see this as something that I want.

One could compare this to a Mexican franchise, something that in itself is a hilarious strangeness when one is living with so many actual Mexican that can cook amazing things out of mystery meat, lard, flour and chili.
