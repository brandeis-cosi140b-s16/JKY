To the other reviewers of this establishment: HELLO! You don't go to a place like this expecting great food or outstanding service. You come here because you want to see pasty, chubby white college chicks in stupid balloon hats pounding sugary drinks, raging sloppily in a sad attempt to drown out the unspeakable misery their shitty futures hold: double-wides, obesity and litters of squalling, snot-nosed brats.

YES, it's unbearably loud -- you'd welcome ear-splitting shitty Top 40 music too, if you were trying to drown out the squalor of your miserable existence. If you want nice quiet conversation-level music, git your ass over to some elitist liberal hotbed that serves tapas and jazz. Senor Frog's is for REAL AMURRICANS! And real Amurricans like their music LOUD and SHITTY!

YES, it's overpriced, crappy bar food. What the fuck do you expect from a tourist franchise catering to hordes of sunburned fat-asses disgorged by cruise ships listing dangerously from all the excess weight crossing the gangplank??!

For reals, people. The only reason to come here is to ogle depressing drunk middle-Americans. So loosen your fuckin' tie already, order up a gallon jug of slushified 150 proof hi-fructose corn syrup, and get with the program!!!!! It's the Greatest Show on Earth!!!
