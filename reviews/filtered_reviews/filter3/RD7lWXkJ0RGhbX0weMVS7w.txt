Don't get me wrong, as I mentioned last time, the servers and the quality of the food are top-notch.  However, this is the second time we have visited the Mission and its the second time we have been treated VERY poorly by the host-staff, specifically a man with dark hair in a hip button-down shirt.  He stands at the desk prepared to seat people, but if you don't look the "Scottsdale" part, he is condescending and rude.  We decided to give it a second chance BECAUSE the food was so good the first time, but we will not visit again.  The host left a foul taste in our mouths one last time.
