It was extremely noisy and congested inside and in line for the register. But we got our food fast and it was great! Getting to-go boxes was a bit of hassle because we had to go back to the counter for them, and as mentioned, it was a bit crazy in there. The person who got the to-go lids for me was a little rude but he was busy and I didn't take it personally. This place seemed very popular! It wasn't the best that we had two babies (because of how crowded it was) but it was good and we'll go again.
