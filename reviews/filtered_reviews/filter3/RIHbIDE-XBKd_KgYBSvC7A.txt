I read the reviews of this place and decided my wife and I should try it out. It's a little hole in the wall and reminds me of a Filabertos type restaurant. We did take out for our dinner order. They were kind of busy and it took about 30 min to get our take out order. The food is significantly better than a Filabertos type restaurant. I had a chili releno  combo that was really good. My wife had their tamale combo and she thought they were great. We also had some fish tacos which I really enjoyed. The fish was grilled not fried, and were right up their with Rubios fish tacos. I would visit this place again.
