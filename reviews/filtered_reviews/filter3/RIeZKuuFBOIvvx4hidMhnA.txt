I've come here a few times now for taco Tuesday's with coworkers during lunch, and I figured it was time to write a review already.  I'm not the hugest fan of Arriba's, but I do dine here from time to time.  The place is usually pretty busy since its in a busy strip of town, and the service is pretty good.  

I usually get two taco's and a drink of some kind while I'm there.  I guess the shredded beef taco's are not part of the "taco Tuesday" promotion, so their a whopping $4.99 each, which kind of chaps my a$$, if you know what I mean. I could go with the ground beef, but sometimes I want what I want.  They also have chips and dip, that come along with whenever you sit down in the restaurant.

The one thing is, depending on how busy they are, there have been a few times where I have been out of my drink completely, and been parched for a beverage, especially in the summer time.  I know their busy, but hot is hot, and dry is dry ,and I like to stay hydrated during the summer, and I'm a big beverage drinker anyways.

I'm not a Mexican food connoisseur by any means, but it seems to be average food at best.  I leave full, but not craving to come back for more.  If I wasn't going here with co-workers, I don't know that I would be dining here at all.  It's not that their bad, cause their not, but I think its more of an average/blah kind of feeling when I leave.

To my knowledge, theirs no outdoor dining here, and getting in and out can kind of be brutal with the traffic on Camelback. Overall, not a bad experience here to speak of, and I would return in the future, but nothing that strikes me as "amazing" or "to die for."
