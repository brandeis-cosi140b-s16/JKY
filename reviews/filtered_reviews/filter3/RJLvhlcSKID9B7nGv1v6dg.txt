The three stars are for service, decor, ambiance and the margaritas.  

We started off with some guacamole which was prepared table side.  Sad to say the best part of the meal was made by the server but it's true.  The food was less than meh.  There's no doubt in my mind I was given instant rice and that was the most memorable part of my meal.  I can't recall what I ordered as a main dish.

I think this is a great place for happy hour margs and guac... nothing else.
