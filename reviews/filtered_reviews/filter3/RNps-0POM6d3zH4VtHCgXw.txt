Went for a quick lunch on a Friday after reading some of the glowing reviews here. 

I liked the ambiance. The smell of the open pecan wood fire lent a 'campfire-y' feeling to the dark place.

I got a Carne Adovada Burrito with red and green sauce. The burrito was pretty good, but not the best I've ever eaten. The meat was great - a far cry from the typical dog-food flavored mass that is typically served at most mexican restaurants. I'd have liked to taste some more of the smoky flavor from the pecan wood, though.

The beans and rice that came on the side were entirely forgettable. In fact, the beans seemed like your typical watery, canned pinto beans.

I didn't think that the burrito was really worthy of its $12 price. I'm willing to pay that for a great burrito, but it just didn't quite rise to that amount. It was maybe a $9 burrito.

The service was really good. The wait staff was responsive and the food was served up quick and hot..
