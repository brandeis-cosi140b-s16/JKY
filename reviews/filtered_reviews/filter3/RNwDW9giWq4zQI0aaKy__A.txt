Not the best lengua and cabeza tacos, but you could do much worse in the valley. The tongue was a bit more toothsome than tender, and the cabeza was a little on the greasy side. The carne asada was really well seasoned and not too fatty though, and the carnitas were tender perfection-- muy delicious. 

All tacos are served in a doubled up corn tortillas, which was kind of blah. It was a bummer considering there the corn tortilla tasted more like filler because they were a bit stale. At least there was a very generous amount of meaty filling per taco, each of which is topped with onions and cilantro.

The atmosphere isn't much to speak of, but when looking for a good taco joint, this generally doesn't regsiter on my radar. They could really benefit from adding some grilled jalapenos on the side of their tacos, or at the very least putting together a kick ass salsa bar. You know, the kind where you go overboard and get a tiny plastic container of at least four types of salsa, pickled veggies and pico. Hells yeah. 

Oh, but they don't have that here. They do have some cheap and filling options for Mexican food that are much more authentic than the 'Bertos mold. Hit it up if you're in the area, drop a fiver and feast!
