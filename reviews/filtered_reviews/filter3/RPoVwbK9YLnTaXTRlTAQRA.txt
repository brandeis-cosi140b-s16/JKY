I made reservations on cinco de mayo and was surprised the could even accommodate a party of 5. Although there was a wait outside we were seated immediately. The service was extremely slow and inattentive. The food and just meh...I also got the sweet potato enchiladas and really didnt think they were anything special. I would give it one more chance to see if anything is work going back for. For now i just want to move on to the next review and not wast my time with this mediocre resturant.
