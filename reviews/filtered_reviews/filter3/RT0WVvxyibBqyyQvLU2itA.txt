A great old time mexican place!  The food is good and the atmosphere is what you expect for a traditional slightly run down restaurant.  The service is always great and the food is also wonderful.  It is also laid back and good environment for kids.  The parking is sometimes full and the neighborhood not so great, so try to find a space in the small area.
