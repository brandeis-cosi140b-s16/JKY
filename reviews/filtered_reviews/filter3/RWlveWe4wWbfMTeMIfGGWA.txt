I ordered Shrimp fajitas. The shrimp were plump and juicy and the dish had a lot of kick to it.  The food is fun and festive and the margaritas are served blended. They have a huge margarita machine cranking behind the bar. Emilianos has an upbeat and festive atmosphere. I think it fits perfectly in the South Side works.The menu is your standard Mexican fair, enchiladas, burritos, Chimichangas. One of the more creative dishes I've tried was the Camarones Cobijados seasoned shrimp wrapped in bacon
This place is fun for dates the wait staff is personable and they also have a full bar.
