So my man has been telling me about this place for a while now. Some thing about scorpion shots...

Tonight we found ourselves out and about downtown for our friends birthday, and inevitably end up here to do this "Scorpion Shot."

I asked our server Aerrick what the spirit was in this shot, he replied "what ever you like" - well I tequila. The other 4 had Mezcal.

The whole time Aerrick was super awesome, he was friendly and didn't seem annoyed by our obnoxious birthday boy. He frequently fist bumped and was most definitely attentive. 

Our waters came first, as expected. Beers and margaritas to follow - and just after the food order we had our shots delivered. 5 shots down & A few entrees later we receive our bill. 

All of the Mezcal shots were $20 and rang in as "scorpion" something. And then there was mine. "Don Julio 70" FOR $29.

$29? Are you kidding? I drink 1942 at Goldspike for $25. Let me tell you that it isn't the price point that has me bothered, it's the fact that our server failed to mention the bump or that Don Julio 70 was all he had. I would've swapped it for Mezcal. 

I work in the industry and this is completely unacceptable. Lesson learned for this place - ASK PRICE POINTS AND CHECK RECEIPTS. 

Maybe this was just a button error, and maybe I should have said something... But after almost an hour with a bunch of drunks I was just ready to go.
