Went here with my family on a Monday night. Place was so hard to find. We ran around the hotel forever looking for it. There was a Lowe's conference taking place there, and getting through the crowd to get to the entrance was quite an adventure. 
It was dark and pretty much empty in the restaurant. 

Our service was excellent. We ordered the trio of salsas and the guacamole. Very good. 

My mother and siblings all ordered humongous margaritas. They looked great. I was nursing a massive hangover, so I had a Pepsi.

I ordered the plantain empanadas (not mexican, BTW). The presentation was lacking- they were just there on the plate. Almost like some frozen snack you microwave and toss on a plate. 

I abhor sweet with savory, so this was not the dish for me. The filling is not appealing to the eye and is sweet. They weren't horrible, but I just couldn't get past the sweet. Next time I'll try the green corn tamales.

My sister's friend ordered the tortilla soup. The "soup" was too thick and didn't have much flavor. However, the soup has these cubes of cheese that are so damn delicious...I just gold-mined those out of her soup throughout the meal. They were absolutely my favorite of the evening. I could eat a whole bucket of those cheese cubes!!!
