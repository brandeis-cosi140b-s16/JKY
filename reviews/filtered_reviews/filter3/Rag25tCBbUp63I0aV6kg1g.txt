We really wanted this place to be better. We saw it on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and thought we would give it a try. We loved their house special of fried white fish taco - it was delicious but needed a little more sauce. The house-made cole slaw was dry and cabbage pieces cut too large. The tuna tacos were good but the tuna was overcooked. The queso had a nice consistency and flavor.

The service was fine but nothing really stood out. It is a great casual affordable option in NoDa with good margaritas.
