Honestly I don't see how they have such high ratings because the food was ok.  This definitely isn't real Mexican food. The rice and beans were not good. My chicken enchilada was alright.  My husband got the carnita burrito which was pretty good.  However I will compliment on their Margarita mmmm and their tres leche cake.. That was super delicious.  I haven't had that in awhile.  It had a hint of vodka in it too.  Another thing we ordered a side of guacamole and the waiter never brought it to us.
