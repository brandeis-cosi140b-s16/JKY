I was a little wary about meeting a friend here after work because of the reviews, but I guess they are true to their word, Arriba's was A-OK. 

We were seated at around 4:45pm (on a Tues.) and there wasn't too many people in the restaurant. We were seated near the bar in a booth, and our server quickly brought us out some water and chips with salsa/bean dip. The chips and fixins were good. The menu is expansive and between that and chatting with my friend, I didn't really have time to look at it. But I went with my friends recommendation and had the white sands enchilada with chicken and a 99cent margarita. The food came out quickly and hot, and it was really good. 

I'll most likely be back....sometime
