Ok.  I might have given a four out of five stars if the server could pay attention to the tables that he was meant to service.  Instead, on a slow Tuesday night in April, the service was wanton of care.  When I asked about the differences in the margaritas on the menu, the server CLEARLY lied and did not attempt to hide it.  LEARN YOUR MENU THEN PRESENT IT.  

Done with that critique, a few of the nice things did not include the nachos ( mediocre) but the ambience and the rest of the meal was actually ok.  Just needed help getting past the initial brawl with apathy.
And who can afford to have apathetic service??

Sorry.  I said I was done with the negative side.  
Hours later, I emerged less than emaciated yet energized and enthused that I would be able to have the rest of my steak at the hotel...
in a nice friendly environment... 

SO...I would go again but I will probably not.
