I had the grilled fish tacos in corn tortillas, and the taste of that dish is worth four stars, but the price ($13) is at least two dollars more than it should be.  The salsa was good, particularly the thicker hot sauce, and the person I was with also liked their meal.  The service was good on our visit, though it was not really crowded.  The decor is dark and tired, and it was not the cleanest place around.
