Are we getting a few more visitors this year, or are my poor old ears deceiving me? 

I think we are getting more visitors, based on the accents I'm hearing and the number of people clogging the entrance to my little lunch spots...reading the menus...gawking around...discussing all of their personal peccadillo's and preferences..."I dinna wanna fookin taco...I wanna go ta the fookin Breakfast Club" :-)

I think they were Scottish tourists, if I'm any judge of kilt's:)...and maybe soccer hooligans, too...although no soccer is being played in Scottsdale right now...spring training hooligans? :-)

I heard all that and more on Taco Tusday at CV, yesterday...an "elderly" lady from Baahstaahn (probably this side of 100, but well north of 90) complaining in a loud voice that the beef tacos were "tooo hawt...spaahcy hawt!"...imagine that...spicy food at a mexican joint:)

After detoxing with a pleasant little 6 miler along the mighty Scottsdale River, my buddy and I decided that we needed a little retox at Cien Agaves to put a spring back in our steps...I had 3 of the darling little $1.00 shredded beef tacos...my buddy had 11...that's right...11...at a sitting...for lunch:-)

He's 30 years younger than I am and he's a professional athlete... I remember the days before my MC4R gene started misbehaving and I could eat like that...damn genetics! :-)

If I did that kind of thing these days, you would need to chain saw out the wall of my home and use a crane to get me out of the house and onto set of "Biggest Loser":)

Yesterday was a nice day for a taco tuesday retox...great weather for the tourists...I heard a number of un-Scottsdale accents, dialects and languages on the street (as befits a tourist mecca like Old Town Scottsdale) and it looked like the turquoise and tee shirts were flying off the shelves so things are starting to pick up again:)

It's put me in such a good mood that I'm even willing to up my rating of CV to a solid 3.5 stars...although I still don't round up...sadly:)
