A downgrade in rating is needed here. I've eaten here several times since my initial review and while the service has remained very good, the quality of the food seems to have declined. The portions are still generous, but the rice is dry and the entrees are often not seasoned properly - they come out too salty or tasteless. And I wish the margaritas had some alcohol; if there's any, it's almost undetectable - so no wonder they are inexpensive. Service,  4 stars; food, 2 stars; so, 3 stars for the average ... and average is probably the best term to use for this place right now.
