I found this place while looking for a fairly inexpensive place to eat and decided to wing it. 

Walking in, I was shocked to see how dead it was for a Saturday night and I'll admit I started to wonder if this place was going to be worse than my expectations but I took a seat. I like that they sell art from local artists but overall the decor looked pretty run down. Just needs a little sprucing up. 

I ordered a Route 87 cheeseburger and added an egg. The description appeared to be my favorite burger from Jonny Rockets (coincidently named the Route 66) which I also add an egg to. 

It arrived it was everything I hoped it would be. The taste was almost exactly like Johnny rockets. Yyuumm!! The fries were a bit cold but edible. 

The highlight for me, however, was my waitress. She was attentive and so very friendly, checking on me frequently , ensuring my coke was always full. In fact, she kindly offered a to go cup as I was leaving. Score! I wish I had gotten her name because she was a star.
