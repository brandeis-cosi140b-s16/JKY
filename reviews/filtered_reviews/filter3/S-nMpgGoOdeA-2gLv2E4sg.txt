I came for the elote, the staff was super accommodating and even cut it off the cob for me. I compare everything to Elote Cafe so unfortunately this didn't come close. It was a bit heavy on the lime for me. Husband got a quesadilla and that was delish and I was appreciative of the check in deal of a free cheese cup! It was great! Oh, and the indoor music was way too loud for my taste.
