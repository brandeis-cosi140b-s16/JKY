Luckily my wife was with me or I would have given the mission 1 star based on my meal. 
I was served one of the worst meals I've ever ordered in a restaurant. 
I order a chicken entree from what I thought was a nice restaurant, not a pub. The server placed a large plate in front of me, it had a gigantic pile of fries and 4 pieces of chicken laid on top. The chicken was covered in a ketchup flavored BBQ sauce. That's it... It was comical that the chef actually thought of this meal. I wouldn't serve it to my 5 year old... 

My wife ordered the tacos and out of desperation I reached over and grabbed a taco. It was amazing! I couldn't believe the same restaurant would serve 2 completely different meals. I don't get it. 

Moral of my story is if you go to Mission which has a good ambiance and feel...just don't order the chicken entree!
And if the chef reads this, please take that off your menu.
