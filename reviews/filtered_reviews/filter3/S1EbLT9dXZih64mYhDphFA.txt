Dropped here after a conference, and it was well worth it.
Good food, decent prices, big portions.
Sangria & Watermelon soda were yummy, and good guacamole! Really, most of it is bad, this stuff was real.
Portions were pretty big; 2 guys got the chicken quesadillas & couldn't finish. I had the ceviche trio, very good flavor. 
YUMMY plantains.
