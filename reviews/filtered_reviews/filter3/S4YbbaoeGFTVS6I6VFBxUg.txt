Met some people here for dinner recently and I did not pick the place. I usually don't do Mexican chains and unless you're a college student, this place really isn't for you. But as I said, I was meeting several people who picked this place. 

I took a recommendation from my waiter (who was actually pretty cool) and ended up with some Pablano Steak meal that was just ok. It was too much like fajita without the yumminess. This was just so average and reminds me why I do not go to Macayo's much.
