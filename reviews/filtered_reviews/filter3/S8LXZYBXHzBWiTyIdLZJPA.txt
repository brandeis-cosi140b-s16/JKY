Stopped in here for lunch.  It's a very casual place with friendly service.

All the flavors are very vibrant.  I really liked the Carne Machaca con Huevos.  It's from the brunch menu and is kind of a take on steak and eggs.

The langosta taco was my least favorite as the langosta was so mild.

Over all it was a nice meal.
