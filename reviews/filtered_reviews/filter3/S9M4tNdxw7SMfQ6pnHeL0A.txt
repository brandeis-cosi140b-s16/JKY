We went on a Sunday night for dinner. The restaurant was definitely not very busy but the service was very slow. I would not recommend going there on a Friday or Saturday night when they are crowded.

That being said, the free chips and salsa / bean dip were awesome! The mini taquitos just okay but the queso they came with was wonderful. My husband got the sampler platter and was disappointed (it was just a bunch of mini fried appetizers). I had the stuffed pepper and it was good, but nothing I'd crave again. We saw other tables' food go by and some of the more traditional meals (burritos, enchiladas) looked delicious. They also had relatively cheap beers and everyone we saw with margaritas seemed to be enjoying them.

We will be back. Not when we are craving authentic Mexican cuisine but when we want something easy and cheesy and spicy. If you are wanting gourmet Mexican you should stay away from chain restaurants. If you are wanting good ol' Tex Mex at a decent price, hit up Arriba (unless of course it is a Friday or Saturday night, then steer clear!).
