Meh.  Went there for a birthday thing a couple of weeks ago.  I'm glad someone's trying to do this in Pgh, but the execution is a little weak.  (I'd actually prefer that someone try simple, good Mexican before getting all fancified with it.  Seriously, there's no place to get a good, simple tongue taco for under $3 in this town.)

Despite the creativity with the menu, there's something flat about the food.  (The barbacoa I had tasted like canned pulled pork.  Probably wasn't, but that's what it tasted like.)  

Service is average at best, but don't ask for anything special or complain or distinguish yourself in any way: the owner's completely insane and will make your visit a real pain.  I'd heard this from friends and didn't believe it until I saw it happen with my group.  I'm just glad I wasn't the one arguing with her.
