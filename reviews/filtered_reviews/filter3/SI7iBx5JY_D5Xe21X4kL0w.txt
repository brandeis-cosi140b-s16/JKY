Tqla is nice enough. We started an evening here. Reservation was a breeze and all that, however we came early for just a drink and we didn't realize that only the bar is open seating. All others high tops and whatnots are not. So we waited for that and got a grand seat in front of the enthusiastic pro-karaoke man that welted out Margaritaville like he was getting paid by the decibel. He might be ju fine entertainment for some people, but I am less amused. Especially since it makes you eat in silence while making awkward eye contact with your friends.

Overall it is an ok place, but I had heard more about this place than it delivered and post-visit I concluded that it must be the lack of competition that fills this place at 5pm on Good Friday. monopoly at its finest is a sweet business aspect. I respect that, but as I said I expected more. 

The waitress staff was sweet and accommodating and that goes some way too. 
I still haven't made my mind up about this place. I realize that I will come back when in this neck of the woods. But it will probably not be MY suggestion.
