The food was very good. This is a definite would go back type of place but not one of my "take the out of town friends to" type of places. The best part each time I go is always the salsa. I'm not typically one for a super chunky salsa but the flavor is amazing. This is the type of place you can take a picky eater to and still get a slight culinary experience as well. The menu has a number of great options worth checking out.
