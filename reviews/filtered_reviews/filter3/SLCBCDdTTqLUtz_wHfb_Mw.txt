It was my first time here n i was on a date. I'd have given a five star review but the lady who helped us was really snippy n sarcastic, which made my date get irritated n say  some mean things the whole night. Other than that my chimichanga was really good. I could have done without the waitress n the bad company. They should have eaten together.
