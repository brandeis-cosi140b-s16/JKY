I didn't order much so it's hard to review. I got chips&salsa... the chips weren't that good but the salsa was delish. We got a side of guacamole to eat with the chips and it was very bland, we added salt, pepper, and salsa to it to make it better. I also ordered a churro which i didn't care for. The place was clean and the ladies were nice so that's s plus!
