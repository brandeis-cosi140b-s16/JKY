It's a see and be seen type of place in the Epicentre Uptown, and the d√©cor and vibrant energy is palpable.  Bisected tree trunks cast in cement in the entry way and main dining area are comparable to cobblestone paths (charming, but be careful, ambulation on them isn't as easy as it looks), and seatbelts woven into surprisingly comfortable chair and stool seats strap patrons in for upscale Mexican cuisine. Al fresco dining options overlook busy College and Trade Streets, which is prime real estate for people watching.

The food itself at Vida Mexican Kitchen Y Cantina is good, but not great, especially for the price tag. Menu stand outs include the Pork Barbacoa and the Chicken and Corn Enchiladas entrees, while the Grilled Corn with Queso Fresco and the Pineapple Papaya Coleslaw are beautifully summery sides. The ubiquitous chips and salsa also deserve a nod, as the salsa has just the right amount of kick to make the longer than average wait for the entrees more enjoyable. Those that enjoy guacamole also sang the praises of the Table Side Guacamole.

Skinny Margaritas, Vida's 100 calorie creations that are "full of liquor", as one server put it, are served in martini glasses. Be careful not to make the rookie mistake of not paying the bar bill prior to heading to your table, though, because attempting to separate the bills out along with the dinner bill led to frustration and wasted time for the group and the adorably accented server. Had the server in the bar area not told the group that it wouldn't be a problem divvy the bill at the table, it would have saved us all an extra 30 minutes and a distaste for the restaurant itself.
