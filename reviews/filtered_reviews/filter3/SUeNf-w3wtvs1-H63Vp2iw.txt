Fresh ingredients, unique draft beer selection, and great service make this a nice stop in the Forum Shops.

Battered Fish Tacos were excellent as was the Handmade Guacamole

The negatives that took them down a couple stars were the carnitas really needed to be strained a little before being put on the fresh corn tortilla, they were very greasy and we ended up just letting the tortilla act like a sponge. We didn't finish them.

Also the margarita I received for checking in was normally priced at 11 dollars and if I had actually paid that for it I would have been disappointed.

All in all a good lunch though
