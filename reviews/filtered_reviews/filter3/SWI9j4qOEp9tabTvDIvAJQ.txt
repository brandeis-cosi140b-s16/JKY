I've been to Yo Rita a few times. I agree with the other posters who say it's expensive - every time I've been there I end up adding costs in my head so I don't end up spending a fortune, because paying the guts of 20 dollars for a couple of small tacos does not sit well with me.

The place is nice for stuff like birthday parties, you wouldn't go there all the time but it's nicely decorated and isn't unpleasant to hang out in. The cocktails are really nice and I like the free chips. 

So I think it's great for a small bite and some fancy drinks on a special occasion, but I wouldn't make a habit of going.
