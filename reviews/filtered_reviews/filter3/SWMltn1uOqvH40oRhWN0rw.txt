I like how it's cheap and authentic. The flavor and texture was pretty mediocre though. The chicken rolled taco was possibly missing the chicken. It was crunchy for sure. The toppings on it was good. The beef tamale and chicken taco was dry. Tasty, but dry. I'd come here again because it's cheap and easy.
