I'm on the fence about this one, We had dinner here on 2/8/15 and this trip was really a foodie trip, so we decided to try something different, so we asked a friend who travels to Vegas for work A LOT and he recommended this place and the mojito in particular.

The decor is dated but kind of cool, the music was nice, it looks like they have live bands there (but not on a Sunday night) 

We got a starter sampler (I don't remember what it was called, but there is only oone on the menu) and it was pretty good, the tamale was amazing and so was the mini cubano. 

He had a shredded beef dish (I tried it, it was really good, better than mine actually)

I asked our waiter if he recommended the the chicken or the pork dish I was torn between, he actually said he never ate either one. Soooooo I don't know how well they know thier menu's I'd think you should be able to make recommendations and at least give a better overview if someone who's never eaten there wants to try something new. 

I went with the pork, it was pretty good. 

We also ordered mojitos, tastey but I am not a fan of more stems than leaves, I asked why there were stems and was told they had more flavor - but for me, it made it really unattractive.

Would I return...? Sure, but I would probably order what my guy had and drink something with less stems, it was clean and the wait staff was friendly.
