I had to try Chuys since I'm a huge fan of Mexican/Tex Mex food. Chuys is located in the beautiful location of Southpark the decor is very festive and the servers are very friendly! They brought out the chips and salsa the salsa was very bland. I ordered a vegetarian plate that included a chile rellano and a vegetable enchilada with rice and beans. The portions were large so you definitely get your money's worth but the food was not impressive just very bland and average.
