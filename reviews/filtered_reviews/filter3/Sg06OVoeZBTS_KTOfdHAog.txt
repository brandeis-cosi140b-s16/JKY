Nice spot. Food was tasty but a bit over priced.  20bucks for 4 small chicken enchiladas.  3bucks for chips and salsa. Felt like I was paying mostly for the atmosphere, but then looked over and saw a mechanical bull in the middle of the restaurant. Service was fast and friendly tho. Definitely liked the location being inside the new Linq area.
