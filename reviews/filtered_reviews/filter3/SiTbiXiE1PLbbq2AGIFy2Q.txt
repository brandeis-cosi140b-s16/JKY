Should this actually be a 2 star review rather than 3? Probably, but I have eaten here several times in the past and enjoyed the casual environment. 

This seems to be the case of a good restaurant on the down hill slide. The service has gotten worse with each visit. This time the service was less than desirable. There was a really cute young lady at another table that got GREAT service from our waiter. Hey, I can't blame our waiter, I just don't want my family to not have what they want or need. 

When we asked him why there were only 2 tacos when he said the meal comes with 3, he went on a diatribe about how the Chef's and servers need to get on the same page. "Some chef's are cool with it (3 tacos vs. 2) and others aren't. We (Wait staff and kitchen staff) need to get on the same page." This looks like a lack of management control.

Too bad! I likely won't be back any time soon.
