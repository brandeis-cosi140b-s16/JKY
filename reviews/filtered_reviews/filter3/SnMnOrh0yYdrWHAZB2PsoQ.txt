Their food is ok. Personally I think that el patron in monroeville has the best Mexican food in the area. Their drinks are reasonably priced. For a Fri or Saturday in shadyside, this is the new place to be. It has a lot of space and a roof top bar. It depends who else is around to make up the atmosphere. There were a lot of cmu students who.just finished their mbas there. They were moody and rude to the bar tenders.
