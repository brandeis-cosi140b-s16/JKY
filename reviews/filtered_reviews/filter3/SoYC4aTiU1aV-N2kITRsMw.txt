Atmosphere wise, this place is awesome. Very big interior with a huge bar area as well as seating area for dinner. Rum selection at the bar was definitely lacking, but the overall options were pretty god. It's a bustling scene and one of the more happening place in uptown Charlotte. It's basically an upscale and trendy Mexican restaurant. 

Food wise, it was just ok. The guacamole was decent but not nearly the best that I've had. I also had a chicken burrito that was fairly good. It was way too big though and very doughy. 

Overall is was a good experience. The restaurant is more so a place to go for the atmosphere. The food is definitely good, but this is more so a place for a rear happy hour.
