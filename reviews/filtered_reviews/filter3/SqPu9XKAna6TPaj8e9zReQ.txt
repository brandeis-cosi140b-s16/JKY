good authentic Mexican. Good Chinese. good cocktails. However, for a place that brands itself in inventiveness, I expected more... Mary the cuisines, spice up some dumplings, throw some Peking duck into a taco, go crazy! But no... You get Mexican OR you get Chinese... If you want both, then you have to order both. The best attempt at this was a beef tendon (yes, tendon, not tenderloin) taco with a raw Kamotto oyster on it. Good, but not great (1 more oyster would have been nice. And while their at it, drop some spice in there too). Nice try Jose, but step it up.
