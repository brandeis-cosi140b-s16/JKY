For starters - get a freaking misting system for the patio - I almost over-heated here last night while watching the Lakers take on the Celtics.

The food was good (nothing astounding), service was better, and the coronas..... um, tasted like coronas... (I can't tell if they were extra cold or if I was extra hot). Bonus points for having truly hot salsa available.

Funny how they have a heater system outside but no attempt at cooling whatsoever... fans? misters? something please!
