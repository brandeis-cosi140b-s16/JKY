Had high expectations for this place.  DIdn't quite deliver.  The positives:  the duck is AMAZING!  The negatives:  high pricing for portion size, weak but ridiculously expensive drinks for the area, a menu that didn't offer many adventuresome dishes.  The restaurant is extremely loud... small quarters with stone walls and you couldn't hear any dinner conversation.  Service is OK, but no one is overly friendly.  Art on the wall is nice, but looks like it was done by an elementary school kid yet has $500 price tags.
