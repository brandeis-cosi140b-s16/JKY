Let's start by saying the food is good and I love the atmosphere.  But the service is slow.  My husband had the crab enchilada abs dais is the best seafood Mexican food he had eaten.  I got the pork Caritas plate.  Loved it.  We decided to try again two more times to see if the service was any better.  It was not.  Very very very slow.
