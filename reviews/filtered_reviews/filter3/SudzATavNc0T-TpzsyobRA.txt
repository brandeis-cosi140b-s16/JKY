I really expected better. I read all these glowing reviews and was rather excited to go. However, everything was a la carte and very small. Fine, no worries, I do not expect everything to be like a typical Mexican restaurant. I can adjust. I ordered a chicken taco and a carne asada tostada. The chicken was dry and the tostada was burnt.

The restaurant was clean. Service was good and friendly, but I do not go to restaurants for atmosphere....

I will probably try this place again to see if I just hit it on a bad day.....but overall I was not impressed.
