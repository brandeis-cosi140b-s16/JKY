My friends and I decided to try Diablo's out since it seemed more "fun" than the Monte Carlo Cafe. We needed a decent restaurant to eat and drink at before we started getting ready for our night out on the town. The wait was give or take 30 minutes - which seemed like the longest 30 minutes ever. All of us decided to check out the menu so we can decide what we want once we sat down knowing the service was going to be slow since it was a Saturday night and the restaurant was busy. 

Within those 30 minutes I had changed my mind 3x on what to order. Grrreat - that's what happens when you give me time, I change my mind! On to the dining selections.... (we all shared) 

-- Appetizer Sampler - Beef Taquitos, Potato Skins, Diablo Wings (Mild), and Calamari (Rating: 3/5) The potato skins were delicious! 
-- Diablo Burger - The patty was at least inch and a half thick, the bottom bun was hard as a rock, but the fries were fried to perfection! (Rating: 2/5) 
-- Pulled Chicken Burrito (dry) with sauce on the side - According to my friends it was good. It came with rice, beans, sour cream, pico de gallo, and guacamole on the side. (Rating 3/5) 
-- Rockin' Shrimp Tacos - The shrimp was battered and deep fried served in a flour tortillas (3 small tacos) served with rice, beans, sour cream, pico de gallo, and guacamole. The shrimp tasted delicious (Rating: 3/5) 

The wait was a-okay, I was starving so my stomach was biased about the wait time here. The waitress was very attentive for the first half of dinner, she stopped by at least 3x to ask us if we were doing okay. However the last half of the meal we were completely ignored. The food was nothing fantastic nor was it that bad. If you're staying at the Monte Carlo and need a decent place to eat besides the buffet or cafe - come to Diablo's. Decent prices for the food and atmosphere makes it a fun experience.
