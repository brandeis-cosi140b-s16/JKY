Salty's is great for outdoor happy hour with your friends. or maybe you want to set up and have a sand volleyball game. They also have live music on weekend, outdoor TV for sports fans and then again, right across from the ball field during spring training. Food...not exceptional...but if you order a few buckets of mini beers it can taste better.  The chips and salsa are a great easy much and they have unlimited refills for a few bucks.

Service...well, it can be really really slow if its crowded, so do not expect anything to come quickly.  Salty's can be a really great hangout...and that's why we have our Friday happy hours there. Bunch of friends drinking and eating chips and kicking it up sand with the volleyball
