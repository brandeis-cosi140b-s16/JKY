The tortillas are fresh and made in front of you. ... such a change from what passes as a tortilla on the east coast.  This takes the baja fresh experience up a level. The pork is very good though a bit on the sweet side. Standard taco was served with lettuce tomatoes and pico. Rice and black beans accompanied the meal. Drinks are mostly soft drinks, though they serve house made limeade as well. The biggest downside of the location is the high ceiling industrial look, which combined with the loud music and the tile floors makes it impossible to carry on a conversation.
