Stopped in here for dinner and drinks with friends last night.  Upon entering the place I noticed the look and feel is almost identical to that of the one off East Blvd.  Not a bad thing.  Large bar area to the left was open and inviting and the service from the moment we stepped in was great.

I was a little off put by the fact that this night they had run out of steak and scallops but I suppose these things happen from time to time.  I got a Southwestern salad with chicken and wasn't dissapointed.  Also the gauc was very good, although at $9.50 a bit pricey.

Parking is a little crazy in Stonecrest as you might already know so be prepared to walk after parking.
