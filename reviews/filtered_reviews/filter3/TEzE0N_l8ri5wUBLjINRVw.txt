This is a nice little place to hang out for drinks and pretty yummy food. The prices are  reasonable, especially their happy hour prices. My fiance is a big tequila fan so he was very happy with the large tequila menu. This place gets pretty packed sometimes so we always end up sitting outside because it's SO LOUD inside. That is my only real gripe about it. The food was pretty good, nothing amazing, but pretty yummy. It's a nice place to just hang out.
