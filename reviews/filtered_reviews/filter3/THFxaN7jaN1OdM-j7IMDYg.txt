Oh how I wish I could have given this very popular place more stars. I don't know, maybe because I grew up in a Mexican neighborhood in Chicago, or that I lived on the West Coast for years, but I have a certain expectation for Mexican food that I have really yet to find here in Charlotte (except at a couple of dive joints down South Blvd). Anyway, I know the whole story about the South African owner, and JWU trained Chefs, blah blah blah. But here's the story....the food just isn't that spectacular. It isn't. The guacamole was good, but had TOO much line and not enough salt to bring out the flavors. It could have used more red onion as well. The chips were good, but lacked salt and didn't seem that fresh to me. The Orange and Spice Crusted Pork Tenderloin was average, and the pork was well done, not a pink center which I asked for. The "crust" part was tough to chew, and I just couldn't finish the dish because of it. 

I got their "spicy" Margarita and while good, I didn't get the whole "spicy" flavor that our lovely Community Manager Nikki raved about. I'm thinking, WHERE'S THE HEAT? It did say SPICY didn't it??? Ugggg

The highlight of the evening was them giving us the Queso and tortilla as a complimentary extra. Now THAT was really good....honestly the only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 2.

The restaurant is really loud, and very busy. Which is a good sign. But I'm convinced that the good folks of Charlotte just haven't had a really GREAT, AUTHENTIC Mexican restaurant yet. When you do, you'll see just how different and BETTER it is than all these Tex/Cali Mex places that exist in Charlotte.

Look, this is a decent place for sure. Will I come back? Probably, and just get a darn Burrito, Chimi, Quesaidilla or Fajita. Maybe they do those the best?
