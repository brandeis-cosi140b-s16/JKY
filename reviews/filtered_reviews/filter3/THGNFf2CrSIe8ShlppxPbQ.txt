A friend of mine lives near Tee Pee's and seemed to like it a lot so when I saw deal on Groupon I decided to buy one and try it out. I am a major chip person...... if they aren't good then I don't want to eat there and Teepee's chips were acceptable, but not great. 

My friend loves the guacamole since they put paprika in it but I did not like the consistency. I got the shrimp & chkn fajitas. Half of my family is Mexican so I know good when I taste it and once again this was somewhere in between. They use a ton of cheese and the portion sizes are huge. Although the food was so-so our waiter was very attentive and did an excellent job. I may come back for a happy hour special one day if I'm in the area.
