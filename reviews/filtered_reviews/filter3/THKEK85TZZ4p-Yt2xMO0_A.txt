For lunch they've got some pretty good food and I've been there a few times now with local businesses for meetings.  Chips and Salsa are really good (and yes that matters) and the taco's I had today (grnd beef) were really good, not greasy and everything was filling and appropriately priced.

Nightlife... typical Scottsdale bar, not much more to say.  Decent patio for hanging out, but typical scottsdale croud.. no surprises there.  But good place to hang at night.
