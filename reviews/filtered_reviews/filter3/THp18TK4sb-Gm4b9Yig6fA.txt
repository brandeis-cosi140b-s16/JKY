First of all, the food was AMAZING!!!  But the service was the worse I've had!  I'm not a complainer by any means, but this waitress  was terrible.  Our food didn't come together, 1 person in our party of 6 didn't even get their plate at all.  She said she was going to take it off the bill, then proceeded to have her co worker come over and have us pay for it.  It was a cluster fuck.  No one apologized or owned up to anything.  I forgot to mention, the rest of the service our original waitress was hiding out from us, bizarre!!!  
  But let me tell you, the food is well worth to come back to.  Every time we'll be in downtown Vegas, we will definitely be here to dine!  Hands down, my brothers Loco Moco nachos were the best!  And don't forget to try the Mexican corn as an appetizer.  Prices were good for the quality of food you get!  A must try
