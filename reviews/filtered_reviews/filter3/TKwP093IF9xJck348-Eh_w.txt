My first experience to gallo was with a meetup group. The food was good and location was cute..the waitress we had seemed to be out of it or just not used to having more than a couple tables.  Although we were a group of 8.  She seemed calm but yet it wasn't busy except outside. Our table numerous times was being sought out by the group as she didn't cater to well to us.   At the end, I needed to leave early so I asked if she could split the check.  She said sure and came back with it.  It was $24.   I gave my cc and then she came back with my card charged to a tune of 138.    .....after a 10 days of realizing that my authorization of 138 wasnt dropping off. I called to talk to the manager and to have them call me back in regards to a cc charge.  4 more calls over the next 11 days and I finally get a call...why did they wait this long...once I got a hold of the manager she was nice but very much not so on top of returning the call.   I took off one star for the waitress and one star for the management neglecting my concern for so long.  The employees on the phone when I called seemed really nice and sincere..I believe they made the effort to get my number relayed. ...will I go back...probably not because I have plenty of other choices out there.
