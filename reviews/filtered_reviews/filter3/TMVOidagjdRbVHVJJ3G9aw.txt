This is a nice restaurant with a sport bar atmosphere. Their menu consists of Nachos and Burgers.  The Hubby and I ordered the chicken Thai Nachos and the Shrimp Nachos.  Both were good, but the Shrimp Nachos were way to spicy to enjoy.  The average menu price is about $10 and if you want a larger order of nachos "entree size" they add about $4 more.

I can see myself coming here again if I'm in the area, but I wont make a trip across town specifically for the restuarant. Dont get me wrong... its nice, but not great.
