I found Milagro Grill based on Yelp recommendations. I was in the general area and in the mood for tacos.  This seemed to be the likely choice.  

The rating of A-OK neatly sums up my experience here.  The vibe is relaxed, service is reliable and the food was reasonably good.  I will say, I had very high expectations for the avocado tacos after reading rave review after rave review about them.  My opinion is they're tasty but not all that memorable. I can live a fulfulled life if I never have another.

Note:  Apparently, they allow dogs on the patio.  One was sitting under the table next to mine.  I didn't find this particularly bothersome but some may.
