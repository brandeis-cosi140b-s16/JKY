Took my wife back here for lunch since she loved the fish taco's so much the first time we went. Unfortunately it wasn't nearly as good this time. The fish taco's didn't have the same flavor they had the first time.

I didn't get a receipt so I don't know where I was over charged but adding it up in my head I certainly didn't pay the prices that were posted on the menu on the wall.
