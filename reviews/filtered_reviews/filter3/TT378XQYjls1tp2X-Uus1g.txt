Once upon a time I would have given this place at least a 4.5 star rating...  
Leticias has lost its luster! On multiple occasions they have been out of simple things like bottled water... or a liquor behind the bar.  Items on the daily menu go unavail for days. I have spent many evenings at the bar plugging money  in the video poker machines and enjoying the company of their amazing bartenders(Justin and Liz) . My husband is a fan of many of their dishes or should I say was a fan until here  recently hes complained that the food isnt the same.  Sadly somethings gone terribly wrong we truly hope the management gets the kitchen back in order otherwise the only reason patrons like us will visit is to say hi to the staff and pray they will have our drink- Not a fan of Mexican gourmet but once upon a time I would have recommended. For now we are in search of good mexican food...  Too bad because we live so so close.
