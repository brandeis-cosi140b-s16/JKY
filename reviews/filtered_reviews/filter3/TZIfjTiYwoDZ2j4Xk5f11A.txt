I really wanted to like this place. The ambiance is cool, the menu items looked appealing and the service was average. Unfortunately, our food was OK and I felt it was overpriced for what we got. The sangria we ordered was refreshing was only $20 for a pitcher. All in all, I probably wouldn't come back here unless it was for happy hour which I have been told is a good way to experience this restaurant.
