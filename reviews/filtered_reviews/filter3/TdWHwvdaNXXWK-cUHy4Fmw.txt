I hate to be the critical one since everyone else raved about this place but I thought it was ok. I ordered the 3 tacos so that I got to try most of the meats. I got the chicken, kahlua pig, and steak. Beware! The steak has chinese five spice in it! That was the taco I didn't eat; I hate five spice. The chicken and kahlua pig were good; however, I prefer the chicken. We also got an order of the chips and guacamole. The guac was good but the chips were stale. We exchanged it for another bag but those were also stale. On the plus side, the service was great! The counter employees got us through fast and were super friendly. They even came by to check on us. If I could suggest one thing... Mac salad! Mac salad is something I look forward to at hawaiian restaurants but they did not have it here. I get the chipotle concept with chips and salsa but a side of mac salad with my tacos would have topped it off just right!
