My first and only visit so far to Sam's Cafe was quite nice. The house margarita is a bit pricey, but they offer some good happy deals so be sure to get in on those. I had the Black and Blue quesadilla and it was delicious. Our server was bit quirky but friendly and attentive. The atmosphere on the patio is wonderful. With the fountains nearby and plenty of opportunity for people watching, you can easily relax and enjoy your visit.
I won't say Sam's blew my mind, but I would definitely visit again. Especially for hour happy.
