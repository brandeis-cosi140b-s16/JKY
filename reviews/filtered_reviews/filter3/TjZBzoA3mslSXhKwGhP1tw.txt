I had the lunch special fish tacos which surprisingly didn't come with rice and beans. I enjoyed them with their salsa bar habanero salsa. Couldn't feel my lips on the way out. The server was very attentive. It was really OK but with so many good mexican restaurants around Chandler it didn't make the cut as anything special.
