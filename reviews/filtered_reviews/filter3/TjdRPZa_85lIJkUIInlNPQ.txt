Never ate here but we come here regularly for the happy hour and the scene. Good group usually a fun place to people watch. Tends to be a lot of attractive people lurking about. Like myself.

The service can be hit or miss. The 1 bartender guy who rides his bike and is bald is really the only person working there worth a dang. He knows how to take care of people. The rest are just twenty somethings that tend to spend more time hanging out in the corner talking to each other than worrying about the customers.

Either way we will keep coming back for $3 Tecates.
