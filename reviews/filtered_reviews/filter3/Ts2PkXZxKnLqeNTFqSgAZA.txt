This was the second stop on the taco tour with Jon and Amy H. I had been waiting (patiently) for this place to open after the closing of Atoyac and was so excited to try the new place. We arrived around 8 and didn't have to wait in line, so I was happy about that. The husband and I split the brisket, bacon, and fish tacos and an order of sopapillas. The tacos here are more expensive than other taco places... to the point that they really need to be great to be worth it (each taco is at least 3$... that can get steep if you want a whole meal).  As we waited for our food, Dan so nicely offered us some chips on the house... very nice. Unfortunately, the food just wasn't very good. The brisket was bland.... I would not order it again and wouldn't suggest others do either. The meat was tender, but nothing special at all. The bacon taco was also nothing awesome.... it was like bacon overload and no other flavors. I didn't love it either. The sopapillas were maybe the biggest disappointment... they were way overly cinnamon -ed and probably would have tasted better if they were just plain. The redeeming thing? The fish taco. This may even be better than the one at Atoyac. It was super delicious, with very light flaky fish and flavorful sauce. I would come back just for that. This place will probably be better after they have some time to work the kinks out, and I will most likely try it again, but the first taste left something to be desired.
