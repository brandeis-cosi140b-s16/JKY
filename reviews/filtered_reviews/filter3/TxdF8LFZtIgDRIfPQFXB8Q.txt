We've become semi-regulars at Manuel's lately...usually for happy hour in the bar.  Well the bar is currently being renovated so my wife, daughter and I had dinner in the restaurant last night.  

We were greeted nicely and quickly seated.  My appetizer plate was a little dirty and when I borrowed one from another table the bus boy came by and apologized profusely.  I told him no big deal...those things happen.  Waiter was excellent...very friendly and with a good sense of humor.

Chips and salsa were very good.  Two kinds of salsa...mild and hotter.  My wife and daughter prefer the mild but I like the hot stuff.  Chips were warm and fresh.  Waiter was attentive and kept the basket filled.

Now on to the food...I had the carne asada burro norte√±o style.  Excellent flavor to the meat - sauce could have been a little more spicy though.  My wife had a chimi enchilada style..she liked it too.  Daughter wasn't too hungry so she just had a couple of beef tacos.  The plate was emptied so I assume that she liked it also.

All in all, a pretty decent meal.
