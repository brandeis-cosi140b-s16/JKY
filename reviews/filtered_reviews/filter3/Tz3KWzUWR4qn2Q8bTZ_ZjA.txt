I'd heard really good things about this place, so we decided to head over there and check it out.  The atmosphere is fun and colorful.  Plus, the wait staff all seem very friendly.

I must say this first, I don't like things too hot (as in spicy), so I'm very particular about my Mexican restaurants. 

When we were seated, we were given a very small bowl of chips and some salsa.  My hubby tried the salsa first, and deemed it too hot for me.  So, as I like to do, I asked for a side of guacamole...I prefer that anyway.  When it came, it looked decent, but also had a strong heat factor.  I truly wanted to like it, but could only manage about 2 bites.

We ordered an appetizer of chicken taquitos.  When they arrived, we devoured them!  They were delicious!!  There wasn't much heat to them, but the flavor was so wonderful.  Honestly, I would order that as my main dish, if we ever decide to go back again.

Then came our entrees...hubby got cheese/onion enchiladas.  He enjoyed them a lot.  His only complaint was that there were too many raw onions, but it didn't deter him from cleaning his plate.  I got the carne asada.  The flavor of the skirt steak was wonderful, and the grilling of the meat was good.  My only issue was that it was so chewy.  I've had lots of skirt steak in my life, and when it's done really well, it can melt in your mouth.  We left there about 2 hours ago, and I still feel like I'm chewing some of it.

We decided to end the meal with something sweet, so on our waiter's recommendation, we got the flan.  It was quite tasty, but a little dense.  I'm not saying it wasn't good, but it didn't have that light airy feel to it.

All in all, it was a decent meal.  I'm not sure whether I'd want to go back, or not.  But, if we did, I'd really want to get those chicken taquitos!!
