If you go to Loco Lime and don't get the crab queso dip you are doing yourself a disservice. It is very tasty, although the crab is a bit more subtle than I was expecting. I suggest letting it cool down a bit and get thick and semi-congealed (sounds gross but I assure you it is not).

All four members of our party got the 2 taco meal, so if you are not tacoing it up then you might have a different experience. I went with the Al Pastor. it was interesting though I'm fairly sure I would pick a different meat if I went back. For some reason all of the cheese ended up on one taco leaving the other wanting. The rice and refried beans were fairly standard for a Mexican restaurant, and frankly, I've had better. The folks I was with got the carnitas, steak, and ground beef tacos. I heard no complaints from the first two, but the gentleman who got the beef complained that it stuck with him for the rest of the night.

The atmosphere was comfortable and not overly cheesy (as Mexican restaurants occasionally have a tendency to be) and the server was attentive and correctly split our check 4 ways.

All in all I enjoyed the meal, but since I live within walking distance of 2 other Mexican restaurants (that I can think of) I will be keeping an eye and a tastebud out for something more spectacular.
