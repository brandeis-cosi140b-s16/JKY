Came in for dinner with a group of people from work. 

The staff are hit and miss; some of them are nice and polite. while others are dismissive and not helpful. This includes management. 

The decor is modern but has traditional Mexican elements. I like the design but wished lighting was a bit brighter.

The food: 
Guacamole - the order was like two small scoops of gelato. While it was good, it did not blow me away. 

Queso Fundido - this was cheesy good and I would order it again. I would also ask them to make it spicy somehow. It would have been better with bits of Chorizo in it. 

Octopus and Shrimp Ceviche - Both were fresh and tasted great. Portions again were small. These would be good as tapas style plates. 

Carnitas - The carnitas was surprisingly a larger portion. It came with a couple of medium size pork ribs and a chunk of pork butt. The flavors were good and there was a crunch from the deep-fried pork butt. It came with guacamole, tortillas, salsa, and pureed beans. These were some of the best beans I've had because it was luscious and creamy... I think from either lard or butter. 

Other people on the table had the Camerones Ranchero, Seafood Enchilada, Carne Asada and everyone seemed to like their dishes. 

No desserts because we were too full from everything else. But the server did tell us they has fried bananas and flan. 

In the end, I do not see myself coming back. There are a lot of other good local Mexican restaurants. But for tourists that want Mexican food, they don't really have much of a choice.
