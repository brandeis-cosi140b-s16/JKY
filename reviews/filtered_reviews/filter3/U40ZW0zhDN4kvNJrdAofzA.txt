Good, but definitely not as good as it used to be.  Eleven dollars for two small tacos with hardly any fish or shrimp in either of them but way too much cilantro, plus a small side of beans of rice.  All of our flour taco shells were so chewy that we could barely eat them.  Give customers a choice because flour does NOT taste better, plus there's that whole gluten-free craze.  Draft beers were very pricey for a restaurant.  Not in much of a hurry to go back.  The food is fresh though,which is whey they barely earn three stars.
