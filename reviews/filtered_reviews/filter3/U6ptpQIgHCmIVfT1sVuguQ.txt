On a quest for the perfect fish taco I tried Wahoo's tacos.

A really fun atmosphere inside. Really laid back and fun feel to the restaurant! 
The bar area looks really popular and fun! 

The fish tacos are good but nothing special. I anticipated something really over the top from all the hype and reviews. While it was a decent fish taco it wasn't anything to write home about. 
I prefer the fish tacos at Rubios to be honest. Better priced and crispier :) but I think it's just a matter of personal preference. 

Overall a cool place to meet a friend and hang out
