Food is good! I think one of the better restaurants in Luxor. There are not much but I love the music here. They are always playing one song and mixing it with a completely different song. It great to hear! They have sports on at the bar and they have this great Strawberry Agave margarita! Its a must try. I love their Alambre tacos and their corn and guacamole is not too bad. It is a little pricey but definitely worth trying at least once.
