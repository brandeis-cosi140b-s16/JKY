Decorated for the rich old Scottsdale folk, food is designed for $30k millionaires who don't know any better. 
Ceasar salad: a pile of leaves that I had to saw through myself using a butter knife. I quickly realized that this setup is designed specifically for the escorts who come in to order this - their right forearms won't have any problem with the strain. 
"Street" tacos: Came in hard shells. NO option to get soft shells? Then they're not STREET tacos, dumbshits. Plus, these hard shells were thick enough to crack a tooth. Since I don't have veneers like the rest of your customers, it was difficult for me to gnash through them.
Service is fine and the place is clean and beautiful. And the chips and salsa are excellent - there is a pineapple salsa with a kick of habanero that will sneak up on you, fast! I like it.
