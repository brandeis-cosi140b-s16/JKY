For the Strip, this is a pretty good option for food. It's a bit out of the way (like a mile from the center of the Strip) and compared to the trucks that abound around LA, the price is high (about $2+ for a tiny taco with only one tortilla if my memory serves me correctly, while LA trucks use two), but the flavor is pretty darn yummy. Try out a few including the cabeza (cow's head), which is tender as can be. The al pastor on the other hand is tasty but a bit overdone. My co-eater pal like the crispiness of the meat--and I can always appreciate meat cooked to the point where I can't feel the fat, but this made it a bit tough to eat... I prefer a little more tenderness. 

Bottom line: Compared to the mediocre buffets all over the Strip that cause you to indulge to your stomach's limits, this is a quick and easy place to eat just enough while getting some bang for your buck.
