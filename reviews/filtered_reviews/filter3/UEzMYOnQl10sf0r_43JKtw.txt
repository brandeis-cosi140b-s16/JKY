My bf and I went here to grab a bite to eat right after we got to Las Vegas.  We were both kind of disappointed because the food was overpriced and just average.  I got chicken tacos which I definitely ate up because I was starving though!  The place reminded me of  "On The Border" or like one Yelper said the movie "Dusk til Dawn."
I also got a margarita which I thought was good especially because I drink a lot of those but for the hefty price of $13.  

This kind of place should give you free nachos and salsa when you get there but nope you have to pay extra for that.  We entered from the hotel entrance of the Monte Carlo and I almost slipped because it's a shiny slippery floor on a ramp (if someone was drunk they would definitely slip and fall in heels!).  

The waitress was okay in service and personality, and I asked about any specials (i previously saw they had ones advertised on the Monte Carlo website) and she told me they weren't any.  False advertisement.  The place is big and has an outside rooftop but it was chilly that day in LV so everyone was inside.  We were there on a Friday at 1:00pm.  Sat down right away and there were plenty of open tables.  

If you want to grab a quick bite to eat right in the middle of the strip, this is good for that.  There are definitely other restaurants that are better in food quality and service in Las Vegas.  People wrote some harsh reviews on the place...I really think in general though all prices for food in LV are just as over priced as NYC-in fact maybe even more!  

I would go back here though for drinks at night-could have a different atmosphere and I always like to give places a 2nd chance if it wasn't a horrible experience the first time!
