The service was amazing but the food was mediocre. We ordered the mussels as an appetizer and it was delicious besides the fact that there was a soup of butter at the bottom of the bucket. I love seafood but covering them in butter is a sorry excuse for taste, personally. I ordered the beer battered mahi tacos, which were delicious and filling. My boyfriend ordered the tamale entree and it was an average tamale, nothing special. Portions were great, but the taste of the food was nothing special.
