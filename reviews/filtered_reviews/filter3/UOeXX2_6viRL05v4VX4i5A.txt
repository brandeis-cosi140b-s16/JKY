We arrived and it took a while to be seated.  Then took a while to get a menu.   We ordered a guacamole for our chips.   It came out almost half way after we had our entries and only because I mentioned it again to the waiter.   My friend wanted an "agua fresca" which they stated they were out of.    Note: big advertising outside restaurant saying "aguas frescas".  My other friend ordered the mango salad which 10 minutes later she was told no mango.   They were also out of asada for asada tacos.   The chicken mole was great but it was piled on the plate like dog food.  I think adding rice and a little touch would improve the look.  Overall the food was excellent.   However when considering the ambiance, the location, and the slight sewer smell, I will have to lower my rating to 3 stars.    Food deserves at least a 4.   But again, the overall restaurant experience is important.
