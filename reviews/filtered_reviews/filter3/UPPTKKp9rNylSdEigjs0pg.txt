Tried Maize for the first time about a month ago and it was good. Tortillas are made fresh so that is amazing. They ribeye steak tacos are extremely tender and the fish tacos have excellent flavor. Wish the place had more sitting space though. Chicken tacos were a bit bland but the salsa verde adds great spice for them.
