After work drinks with the girls! We love the Blood orange Margarita!
Served by everyone that works there. Hard to decide who our actual server is, 
there was problems with the communication that way. We seem to get alot of apologies from the servers telling us that it was shift change and that was the problem for the long delay in getting our drinks. Personally, if it wasn't for going out after work with the girls, i wouldn't be coming here. Not a fan of the way they work things. Love the guacamole and the chips and salsa. Not a lot to chose from regarding gluten free options.
