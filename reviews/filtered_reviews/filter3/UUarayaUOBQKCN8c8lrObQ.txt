Having dined here approximately 5 years ago and having enjoyed our meals I wanted to revisit the restaurant. 

First, is the mandatory (complementary) valet parking. I am perfectly capable of parking my own car, thank you, without the need to use a valet service. 

Second, chips and salsa:  Sorry, Chevy's is just as good but the habanero salsa is wonderfully freakin hot!

Third, my wife's seafood combo was wonderful. My tamales were just so-so with too stringy pork inside. I've had as good or better eating tamales at my farmers market. Rice was dry and crusty in places. The pinto beans were just plain bland. 

I'll revisit on my next trip, or maybe not.
