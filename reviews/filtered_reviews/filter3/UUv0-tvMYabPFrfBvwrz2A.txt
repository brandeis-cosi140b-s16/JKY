We ended up here for dinner out of desperation. It turned out to be better than expected. The avocado fries and sonoran grilled corn were fantastic apps in addition to the chips and trio of salsa. We split the grilled steak and linguisa sausage. The steak was tender and perfectly cooked. The sausage had great flavor and texture. The rice and bean sides were a little bland. We had a pitcher of margaritas that were pretty good, too. They (falsely) advertised happy hour drink specials which were only available at the bar. The atmosphere is nice, dark, with lots of leather and colorful Mexican decor.
