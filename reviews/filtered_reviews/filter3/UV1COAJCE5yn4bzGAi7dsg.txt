The inside dining area is too loud! I'm no grandma but I'd like to hold a conversation over lunch without having to yell like I'm in the club.

Rock Shrimp Tacos 3 for $15....ouch but yum. (best with plenty of lemons) $20 for Chicken Fajitas were alright but I liked the shrimp tacos better, the fajitas weren't as memorable.

Then we watched the staff do the Cha Cha Slide in front of the whole restaurant, it was awkward because nobody really cared for it and the staff wasn't that into it anyways. Portions aren't hearty for their prices but other than that it's still quality fresh mex.
