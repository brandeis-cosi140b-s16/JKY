I am a regular at this Valle Luna location and tonight my boyfriend & I got pollo fundidos with black beans & rice. Usually, service is awesome and the food is great. Tonight was fundido night so maybe that's why they just weren't up to par tonight. Also, the server brought us refried beans instead of black and asked if we wanted another drink when we were clearly ready for the check. Like I said, I'm a regular and tip well, but might not go back for a while because of tonight. Very disapppinted.
