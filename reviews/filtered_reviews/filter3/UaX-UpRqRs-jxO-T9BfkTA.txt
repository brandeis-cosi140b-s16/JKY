This place is great is you're looking for an inexpensive lunch (around $10 w/ tip). The lunch specials are what you would probably expect from a Mexican chain, but they are not bad. I really like the salsas that they serve. Sharing a couple of servings of chips and salsa with a couple tacos hits the spot and leaves me very full. If you work in the area you probably already know about this place, but if not, you should check it out. It won't hurt your pockets and you may end up becoming a regular.
