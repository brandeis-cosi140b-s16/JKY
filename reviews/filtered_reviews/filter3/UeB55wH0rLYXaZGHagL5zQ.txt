The rooftop deck is a nice touch in the friendlier seasons, but the food could be better. They have a decent happy hour with cheap mixed drinks, house wines, etc.. The chipotle salsa we ordered was good and definitely repeatable. The chips were thick and strong--perfect for dipping into guacamole, which was unfortunately subpar. The avocados must not have been ripe enough and were stringy.

My fish tacos came on double corn tortillas which I approve of, with a side of rice and beans. The tacos themselves were only "meh" however, same for the rice. The beans were pretty good.

Overall, my feelings are mixed about Steel Cactus. It has potential, but currently is just a good place to get a drink, salsa, and enjoy the nice weather. The food quality could use improvement.
