If you could give 2.5 stars for this place I would since it was exactly mediocre. Some things good, some things bad. We walked in on a Thursday night and there were a couple people outside (even though it was in the 40s, 50s) and approximately 3 people inside. Very quiet. There was also no music playing, so it added to the quietness. Later, we heard some clicks and an ipod came on with some random selections and then the rest of the night there were the sounds of their computer restarting on their stereo system. A couple people at the bar also, and some guy on his computer there. We ordered a couple drinks as it was $3 wine night, which we liked. They had some selections of good wines too for the 'house' wines..i.e. viognier for $3. Took forever to come and the waiter was downright bizarre. Kept mispronouncing food on purpose and then cackling wildly about a joke he had made. Guacamole was good, if salty, but I like salty. The Grand Marnier on it added a nice touch. Main courses came out before we were even half done with the appetizer which I find intensely annoying. Husband had a shrimp dish which tasted like some watery, frozen shrimp had been put in the microwave and doused with some A1 and Swiss Miss. Shrimp burrito was good though, and huge. We had a gift certificate there, and if we didn't, it definitely wouldn't have been worth the price. Would maybe go back and just have a burrito and sit outside when the weather's nice, but overall a pretty mixed experience. Go at your own risk!
