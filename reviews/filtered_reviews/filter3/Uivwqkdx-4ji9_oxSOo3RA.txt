We been there four times and it's good except if you don't like your food floating in sauces then you need to order sauce on the side. We order the whole fish and each one came out over cooked or burnt. Another time we order burritos which were good but too much sauce on it. Chips and salsa is always good. Great view of the city that's why I have it 3 stars. Food is 2 stars. :(
