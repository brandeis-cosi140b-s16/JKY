Overall , I like this place. A smal hole-in-the-wall place with straight forward, cheap, non-greasy Mexican food. I can dig it. I personally think the one on 7th st is better, but I will chock it up to growing pains since this location's only been open for about a week. I went today for my all time favorite Torta, but they didn't grill my bread so it wasn't nearly as awesome as it usually is...yes, I'm picky
