I haven't been to this location for several months but for some reason I feel like it's changed since then. I got a grilled chicken salad. The tortilla tasted like it had been sitting out since lunch time (we went for dinner). The guac was brown. We took our order to go, otherwise I would have asked them to make me something else. The tin the food came in felt cheap(er than before). My boyfriend actually cut through the bottom with his plastic knife. He said his burrito was okay but not what he remembered it to be. We freaking love Cafe Rio and have been to several and love the food. This time was really a let down and we may not be back if it happens again.
