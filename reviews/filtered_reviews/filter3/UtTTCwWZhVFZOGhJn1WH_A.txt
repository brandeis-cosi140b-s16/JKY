New to town and was wanting to try this place out after driving by a few times. Service was decent. I ordered the beef taco salad which was just okay..a lot of ground beef and not much else. Definitely needed queso and guac to make it more flavorful. I asked for sour cream on the side and got charged for it.. i thought that was standard to bring out with Mexican food? My fiance ordered a tamale and enchilada which I tried some of.. tasted amazing! He definitely ordered better. 

Would love to give this place another try and try out their marg as well.
