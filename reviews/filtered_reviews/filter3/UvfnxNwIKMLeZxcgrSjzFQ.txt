I want to first say that this is a Mexican restaurant with Las Vegas Strip prices, now once you've rationalized that you can sit down and enjoy a nice dinner.  I must say I did like the upscale Mexican cantina decor and there was plenty to see and great music.  I went here for dinner with a friend and we both agreed it would make a nice date spot or even pre-dinner place before partying on the strip.  

I loved the chips which were freshly baked corn tortillas with an excellent sampling of salsas.  I ordered Ceviche as an appetizer which is completely unnecessary since you probably will fill up on all the addictive chips.  I had to ask for them to placed out of arms reach to avoid devouring too many. For my entree I had the tequila salmon  which came with jasmine rich that was both sticky and sweet.  The salmon was filling and tasty but not overly flavorful as what I suspected since it came out on a "hot plate".

The service and attention provided by the staff is certainly top notch and it ended up being a fun and enjoyable dinner.  If you're looking for something different and not too pricey on the strip this is a great place.
