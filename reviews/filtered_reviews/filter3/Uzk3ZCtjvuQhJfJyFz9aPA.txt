Tried this place for the first time the other night. Ordered to go and was really surprised when I got to the restaurant and the line was just about to the door. I ordered a bean tostada, rice & beans and the vegetable salsa and guacamole. The bean tostada was not impressive at all. Very plain. But, everything else delicious. I loved the salsa. I will definitely try something they're more known for next time.
