They offer a great menu selection, including seafood choices.  

I had the special, the $10 burger (special on Sunday, for only $7).  It was the special of the day.  We went (our party of 4) on the way to the Mesa Art Center for a free exhibition.  The other three persons in our party had traditional Mexican dishes, and the report was that they were very good.  The ambiance was a little off putting, being in a less than good neighborhood and the decor was a little dated, but what the hell.  The best part of our meal was the salsa and chips.  Great appetizer!  This restaurant is highly rated around Mesa.  I would go again, would not order the $10 burger, and maybe upgrade my review to 4 stars based on more traditional Mexican dishes like chile rellanos.
