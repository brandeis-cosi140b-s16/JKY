First ime at the location. Was looking for a pollo asada burrito. They did not have. I ended up getting a carne asada burrito. Their type of Mexican food I would consider different than the standard style. Kinda like taco bell, they love adding beans and cheese to everything. I personally don't like it and did not will not return. I felt the burrito was small in comparison to a junk place like Filibertos. Expecially considering half the burrito was beans.
The food; good quality. I liked the tortilla, carne asada, guacamole, pico, it all seem to be of good quality. The carne asada was good quality steak and was surprisingly tender. 
Atmosphere; not bad for a hole in the wall. Did not see a restroom.
