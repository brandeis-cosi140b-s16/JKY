I've been here twice. The food is excellent. The only reason I give it a three is because the last time I went, the table next to us was filthy the entire time we were there. Not once was there any effort to clean it. They also sat us in a corner in the back behind the bar when there were plenty of seats in front.  It made me wonder if I we were really welcomed there.
