Lunch was a great experience, the artwork caught my attention before anything. The servers were attentive and the food was out before I could even blink. It was busy with people during the lunch hour, so that much mean the food is quite tasty.

I enjoyed chicken fajitas (but the chicken was a little dry) as my entree along with the nachos and salsa as a complimentary starter.  I thoroughly enjoyed the salsa at Jalapeno, they give you two kinds - a traditional and a hot salsa.  I would recommend stopping here for a Mexican lunch if you're near this area.  They have a great outdoor patio, but that is only for the nice weather here in Scottsdale.
