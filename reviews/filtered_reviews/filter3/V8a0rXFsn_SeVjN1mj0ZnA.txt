Good looking spot! Food is a bit over priced but to break it down:

Chips & Gauc were good, had a kick to it.  Service was good, for 20 people the staff did pretty good.  Taco's, I believe were best part. Chicken and Pork. For a taco, it does seem a bit pricey, but great for a quick bite and back to the tables. Btw, we waited a long time for this place, and overall, the food was A-Okay.
