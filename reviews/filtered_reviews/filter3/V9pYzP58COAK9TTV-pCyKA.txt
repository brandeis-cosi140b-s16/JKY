This place was tasty but in no way remarkable. The food is perfectly adequate in flavor and portion but doesn't stand out as a 'must eat'.  The service was friendly and quick. If I'm looking for a cheap fast meal I'll take Phat Phranks over fast food or Roberto's any day. The only negative was the horchata was bland and tasted like it was a mix.
