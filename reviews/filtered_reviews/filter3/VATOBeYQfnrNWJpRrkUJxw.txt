Went for Lunch - The Staff while professional did not seem happy to be there. I and several other non-Spanish speaking groups were left to our own  instinct with the wait staff unwilling to explain the menu without giving the non-welcoming attitude that we were just too much trouble. So I ordered the Cognac Chicken while my wife ordered the Beef Tacos. The "Chips" delivered to the table were either old or cooked/re-fried at too low a temperature since they were Oily. The Bean dip was average and the tomato based dipping sauce was a dark, hot, bitter,  variety that is unique to this place. The Cognac Chicken cooked with canned mushrooms and onions actually had a strange sweet taste and the accompanying Rice and Beans were nothing special. The place was very clean as I observed one cook diligently changing gloves when interrupted at her station (excellent). I can't say anything really Great NOR Bad about this place, however I would not go out of my way to eat here as there are so many better options for the price. $ 45.00 for two counting Tip - No Alcohol, Appetizer nor Dessert.
