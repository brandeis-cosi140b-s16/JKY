Eh, its ok.  2 stars better than those 'berto's type places in the area.  

Just your usual divey mexican fast casual spot with the usual cliche arrangements of meat, beans, & tortillas. I had a soft taco & some taquitos. 
They have a drive thru, but I went inside, the staff friendly and pretty quick. There's a self serve salsa bar and the establishment isnt the cleanest place, but its definitely not gross.  

The taco was alright, nothing to complain or rave about.  It had some flavor & spice, i was quite happy that it wasnt bland.  
And the taquitos, they require a bit of effort since theyre buried under a pile of lettuce & cheese and dont automatically come with guacamole.  Meh, all that lettuce made some of them soggy & lose their crunch.  

I might go back there again, but its in crappy mesa, so it wont be too soon.
