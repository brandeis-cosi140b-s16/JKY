The food was good. I ordered the fish taco perfect just what I wanted. I did come on a working lunch so no drinks for me. But my Romeos had beers. It was pretty busy. Waitstaff was nice. When are food came are plates were mixed up so some of my men weren't eating what they ordered but they were fine with it. Dessert time 3 of us ordered flan, chocolate chimis sopapillas. Everything was really good!
