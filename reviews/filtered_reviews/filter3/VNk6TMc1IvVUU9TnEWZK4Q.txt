Good drinks-not horribly overpriced.  GREAT drink specials - $11 for a 20oz GOOD beer and a shot of anything!  Can't beat that!!!  Friendly bartenders and decent food.  

You know, what can you REALLY expect from an airport restaurant.  You don't go for the food.  If you're really hungry enough to eat at the airport, then don't expect 4 star restaurant quality.... and don't judge the airport restaurants as such. 

This really is the only bar/restaurant option in the Southwest terminal.  I found a security guard and asked about some of the other restaurants in the airport and was told that unless you want to make the 20-30 minute hike around security to get around to some of the other gates, you should just stay put.  I'm actually glad he suggested this- even though I had a 3 hour layover.  The menu LOOKS impressive... but again, remember where you are.  I did happen to be starving and needed a little something to soak up the drinks I would be consuming during my loooong layover.  I ordered the poblano burritto.  For an airport burrito it wasn't bad- but it was slightly lacking in flavor.  I asked for something to add some spice and they provided me with three different kinds of salsa to try, which did make it a little better.  

What most impressed me was the service.  The bartenders and servers were all upbeat and smiley- very friendly and definitely created a welcoming atmosphere.  The drinks were not HORRIBLY over- priced and now if you order a beer, you can add a shot of ANYTHING for $4!  I got a shot of Don Julio (which might normally be at least $10+) so ended up paying $11 for a 20oz Modelo Especial and excellent tequila.  

And other reviewers were right.... this is definitely a great place for eye candy!  All the hotties seem to flock here...
