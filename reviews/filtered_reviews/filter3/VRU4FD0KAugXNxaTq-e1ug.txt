They have good food, it's more ethnic than American, and I like that. 

 The last time I went the waiter gave me my food and disappeared and when I cut into it,  and realized it was the wrong order, he reappeared and before I said anything picked it up and said "that doesn't look like the right enchilada, Sorry about that, I'll go have them make another one correctly." I didn't even open my mouth! So I was touched that he was aware and noticed, at the same time I think it's creepy that he just knew it was wrong. 



Anyways I'm not too fond of this place to be honest, I can't really give you a reason why.
