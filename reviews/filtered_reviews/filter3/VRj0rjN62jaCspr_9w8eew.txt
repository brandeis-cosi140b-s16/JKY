This place is really a neat experience; from the water entryway to the busy inside decor.  I remembered food here being awesome so I drug along my fiance after four peaks was a zoo, and we decided to go elsEwhere. The wait was only fifteen minutes for a table,  so we opted to get a drink at the bar in the meantime.  There were three bartenders working,  yet none of them seemed to be in any hurry to get us beverages.  After five minutes of awkwardly staring at the bartender he finally came our way.  A hop knot and casadores margarita cost $15. Overpriced; welcome to scottsdale. 

We were finally called and were seated in the last booth next to both the bathroom and the server station.  Im not sure why they thought anyone would want to sit within earshot of server gossip,  but it certainly wasn't prime real estate.  Our server was nice but extremely slow.  We unlocked the free chips and salsa yelp deal;  for a place that prides themselves in some spicy dishes,  both salsas were bland and certainly seemed store bought.  Thank goodness they were free.  

The entrees were the saving grace of this restaurant,  although don't come here starving because it took around 40 minutes to get our food. We had the cowboy meatloaf and carne asada plate;  both were so good we literally couldn't stop eating it! Drool! We got the fried ice cream which was pretty good,  but not the best I've ever had.  

We will come back for the awesome entrees and hope service improves.
