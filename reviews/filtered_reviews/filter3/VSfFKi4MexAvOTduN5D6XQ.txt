Yay!  I am so happy that an America's Taco Shop has opened up in Old Town.  It is right on Goldwater and 1st Ave, which is conveniently walking distance to my work. A friend and I went there for tacos at lunch today and since it was the first day of their soft opening we got our lunch for free!  The service and food were great and so I know I will be back.

They seem to have pretty much the same menu as the other locations and the quality of the food was just as good as well.  The restaurant itself is pretty spacious, it looks like the building was formerly a house since there are many rooms instead of one big dining area.  The best part is the large "backyard" area.  They didn't have all the patio furniture set up yet but I hope they will take advantage of the grassy lawn and put some seating under the shade of the large mature trees.  It looked really lovely back there.  I can't wait for it too cool down a little more so we can sit outside next time and it looks like a nice spot for happy hour, too.

Only problem is the parking, since it is across from Arcadia Farms who has commandeered most of the street parking for their valet service.  But we were able to find plenty of open spots on Main St, just one block south.
