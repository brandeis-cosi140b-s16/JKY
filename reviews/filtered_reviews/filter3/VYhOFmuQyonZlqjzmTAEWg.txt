There were some pro's about this place: Service was decent and some of the food was really good. However, other food was just meh. The items that were good: Salsa had lots of onions in it which made me happy (I am a big onion lover!) and had a really good fresh flavor, the chips were nice and crisp, the jalapeno cream sauce that came with my numero ocho (8) combo was delicious with just the right amount of spice, and the fideo that the hubby ordered was different but I really enjoyed it (hubby said it was too plain for him). Now onto the other food: Hubby said his pork chimichanga wasn't bad and that the pork was cooked well but needed more seasoning, my chili relleno was ok but the batter had a weird texture to it, and my spinach enchilada was not very good at all. I like to have other components inside the enchilada rather then just plain spinach and unfortunately, these just had lumps of unflavored spinach with nothing else. So all in all, I would say this place was ok. There were some items that are good enough for me to come back but I would just try something else on the next visit.
