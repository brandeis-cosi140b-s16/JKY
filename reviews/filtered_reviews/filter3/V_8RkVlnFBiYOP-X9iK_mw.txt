The food is good and I like the atmosphere.  Drinks also tasty but expensive.

I liked this place better when the weren't so uppity and offered chips and salsa. 

Our waiter said 'we don't have chips anymore' but then shortly afterwards the table next to us had chips sitting on the table.  It was very frustrating.

I guess you 'can' get chips if  you order the $10 table guacamole, but what if you don't like guacamole??  Maybe this place it just to 'trendy' for me...

I just get tired of every place in Scottsdale trying to be 'haute cuisine' and usually failing.  How about some regular 'good food'...
