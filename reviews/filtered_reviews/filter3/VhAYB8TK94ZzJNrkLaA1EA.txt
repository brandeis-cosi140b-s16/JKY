This was my second attempt here. I wasn't overwhelmed. The food is a departure from typical Mexican so look at the menu. I ordered a grilled chicken breast and steamed veggies. Boring, I know.   It was flavorful though. We had chips that were actually really good. There a lot of heat to their salsas.  We sat on the patio. The atmosphere was great. They have a pond/water feature which was lovely. White twinkle lights and lit jalape√±os  are strung above the patio which adds a little enchantment. The tables are low for the chairs, so it's a little awkward eating. You feel hunched over. While I did enjoy my dinner, I won't go back. Too many other great places to eat in Scottsdale.
