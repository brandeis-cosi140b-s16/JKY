Trying this place out with my Cuban friends. Heard this was the place to be for Cuban food so why not. They have exceptional food here! I got the picadillo and it was amazing. Service was a little slow that's why I gave them 3 stars. Should not take 20 minutes to get water to the table, but oh well. The food was exceptional so it makes up for it. I would recommend and come here again.
