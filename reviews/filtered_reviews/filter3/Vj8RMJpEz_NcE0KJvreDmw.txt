After seeing the chile verde burrito from Phrank's listed in LV Weekly's Top 10 Mexican Meals, I had to try it. I happened to be in the area due to a Yelp event, so I called in a phone order and picked it up.

Shout out to their stellar customer service: the lady who took my phone order was sweet, quick, and efficient. And when I called back for their address, she gave me thorough directions, unsurprised that my GPS was coming up with errors. I really appreciated her help.

I finally got my opportunity to dive into my burrito, and it was enjoyable. The ratio of rice and beans was favorable- I prefer not to have too many in my burrito, if at all, and they were flavorful but light. The majority of the burrito was stuffed with shredded chicken, and there was a good amount of cheese, too. 
As for the chile verde component of my order- well, the chicken was flavorful and had a kick to it. But it wasn't noticeably "chile verde", it could have quite easily passed for simply a spicy chicken burrito. This coming from a girl who regularly goes to Albuquerque and knows chile verde very well- I'm even open to interpretations, but this just didn't have the tomatillo-chile kick to it that I was expecting after the rave reviews. That's not to say it was bad, I was quite satisfied with it and felt it was priced well (about $7), but it was not the quintessential chile verde dish I was led to expect.
