Decor - A+

Food - Decent but not the best place in town.  The lowdown:

Skinny Margarita - Good, delicious.

Chips - Too thick - not a fan.

Salsa - Thoroughly enjoyed.

Guacamole - Just ok.  Needed salt and garlic.  Mine is better.  

Braised Short Rib & Avocado Cheese Crisp - Ordered because of the 'rave' reviews on yelp.  It was ok but wouldn't have a craving to go back just for this.

Carne Asada Tacos - Dry, disappointed - meh

Pork Carnita Tacos - Good

Slow Cooked BBQ Pork Taco - Excellent, A+

Brown Sugar Carmel Flan - Amazeballs.  Tasted like Creme Brulee.  A must!

Tres Leche Cake - Wasn't a fan.  It was extremely dense.

Roundup - Not my favorite place for mexican food.  Would I go back?  Not sure.  I guess I got it off the check box for another Fox restaurant.
