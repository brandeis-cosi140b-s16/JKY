Came here for a casual afternoon lunch and it wasn't too crowded.  We sat further inside, but it is nice that the restaurant is open to The Strip so you have the best access to people watching.  I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad and it was pretty good.  The prices were decent.  Would I come back here again?  Sure.  Is it one of my top choices?  Probably not.  I probably would have liked it more if I was drinking!  :-)
