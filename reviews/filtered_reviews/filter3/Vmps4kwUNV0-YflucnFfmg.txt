This place used to be a staple for my family.  Saturday's we'd wake up and head to Dick's for the Carne Adovada.  But the last few times we've been have been disappointed.  The portions and quality of food and presentation has changed within the last five or six months.  

I think it is because they got rid of a lot of the old staff that made that place so awesome.  It was like Cheers, they knew us by name and if not by name at least by face and that is how we were treated...with a smile, great service, and great food.

We are still big fans of Rokerij (which is owned by the same folks as Dick's and Richardsons).  I'd really like to see this place turn back around.  I have many friends who used to frequent this place but not so much anymore.
