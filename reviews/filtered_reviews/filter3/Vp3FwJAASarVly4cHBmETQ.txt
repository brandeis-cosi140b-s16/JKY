Pretty solid place.  Missed it while driving on Central Avenue and then when I went back and found it, I don't know how I actually missed it!  Parking is pretty convenient and there is outdoor seating (obviously seasonal).  The place is a little cramped inside, but you're there for the great food!

The salsas available with the chips are pretty hot.  Not as flavorful as some other places, but there's plenty of heat to make you want to order a margarita or sangria if you haven't already done so.  I ordered a combo while my friend got some enchiladas.  Good quality and good quantity.  Service was a little unemotional or uninterested, but it was prompt and nothing was missed.  The New Mexico style food is a good change of pace than the regular Sonoran style found at most places.  It's more of a place to go to if you're in the area rather than destination restaurant.
