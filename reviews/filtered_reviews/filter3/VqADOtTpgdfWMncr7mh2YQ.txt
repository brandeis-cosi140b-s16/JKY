Came here with a crew of 5 adults and 4 small children. This was early on a saturday evening and the restaurant was not crowded. We were told that we would have a 40 min wait!! I looked around and saw tons of open tables. They said that they did not have another server so they were limited to tables. I couldnt grasp that answer so I asked to see the manager. 5 min later we had a table. Was kinda amazed by that whole ordeal. 
The food was good and the beer was cold. Ambiance was ok but still couldnt get past the initial seating ordeal. Prices were slightly high considering we were in a "remote" area but not too bad.
