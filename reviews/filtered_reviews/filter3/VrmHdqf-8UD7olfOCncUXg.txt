Rosita's was the ONLY place to go for great Mexican food when I was younger...but now it's average at best.  The spinach enchiladas are fantastic but the green corn tamale was tasteless...the fideo was watery like soup...not like it used to be.  At least the water is now filtered to some extent.   My biggest complaint was near the end of our meal...someone lit up a cigarette (wasnt the bar...maybe a cook?) and choked my 83 yo mom and I..we had to leave quickly.  When I complained all I got was "cigarettes?  I dont smell anything".   Rosita would should be turning in her grave!
If the health inspector had been there, that place would have been shut down.
