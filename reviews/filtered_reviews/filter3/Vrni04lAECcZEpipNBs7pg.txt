We have been here twice. We had a crazy fun Friday night outside patio dance night on my 40th birthday a few years ago. We went back last month just for lunch and although it was tasty...it wasn't the place I remembered. I would give this place 4 stars for summertime night life with live music. But, average 3 stars for dinner or lunch. But still, a great place to watch people.
