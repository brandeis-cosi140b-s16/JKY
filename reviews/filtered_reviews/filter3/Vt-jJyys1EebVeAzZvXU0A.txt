Ill start by saying i really love the food. The only reason its 3 star's is because the pork tostada and chicken burrito are always good. We started going to this location about 3 years ago. First, we ordered online all the time. Our food was always wrong! We thought maybe the first few times it was just an accident (it happens), but after nearly 6 times of it being wrong I emailed the manager (not looking for any hand outs but just to let her know). I got a response and of course was offered a free meal and hopes of us coming back. Of course we went because we still love their food but now, we just go in thinking that would be better. Well, everytime there is a line because they move at a snails pace and it seems like noone knows what their role is. Last week my food fell on the floor because noone was watching the oven that they roll the food through! They werent even really that busy at the time and the cook was litterally 1 foot away and he watched it slowly fall off the side!! It takes them 5 minutes to go get jalapenos from somewhere in the back and most of the time we have to ask again for someone to get them because they forget. The last few times the ice has been out too and the cleanliness of the dining area is meh. The sad part is, its mostly a new staff since when we first started going there so I dont see how there are still so many issues.
