Mediocre food, OK prices, so-so decor, good live entertainment.

The service was good and friendly, but the food was disappointing.  The chips and salsa were the best part of the meal, unfortunately.  I had the barbacoa tacos that came with beans and rice.  The meat was tasty but dry and the rice was even drier.  The beans were very bland.  I ordered a margarita which unsettled me and my girlfriend's stomach (in fairness, our light breakfast was probably a major contributor).

The Mariachis were great.  They played all sorts of music and were very engaging and funny.

Was it the worst food ever?  Nope.  But it didn't rise even to the level of Chevy's either in decor or taste.
