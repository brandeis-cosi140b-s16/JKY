Luxor- from the hotel registration, go up the escalator to the right. We needed a quick bite to eat before our flight. 

Shared the Chicken Nachos... $15! With tax and tip, we just left a $20. 
They were pretty good nachos and a good sharing size but way too expensive for  nachos. Glad they were pretty good but wouldn't come back.
