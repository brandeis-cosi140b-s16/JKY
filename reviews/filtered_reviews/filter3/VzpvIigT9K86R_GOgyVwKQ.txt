Inside Treasure Island: 
Signature Drinks (Classic Margarita, Mexican Cucumber, House Muddled Mojito, House Muddled Margarita)
Margaritas and Mojitos are terrific! Definitely a signature item, the muddled margarita comes in strawberry, raspberry, blackberry, pineappple, and cucumber. i tried the strawberry margarita, and with the chunks of strawberry, it was magnificent!  The mojito is the popular cuban drink, mixed with bacardi silver, fresh mint leaves, fresh squeezed lime juice, simple syrup, and house muddled fruit - if you prefer.  typical snacks include classic guacamole, chips and salsa, and empanadas.  located inside the casino, it is a cozy little bar with low lighting and latin beats...not to mention the video poker on the bar.  we were there at a strange hour, on a tuesday night.  one thirty am, and we were disappointed to find they were out of chips and salsa, as well as all other food items on the bar menu.  currently, as i am penning this, the bartender and her three ancillary staff members look preoccupied with talking to one another, instead of asking us if we would like another drink. my friend mike is purposely slurping the dregs of his mojito to indicate he is ready for another...i suppose timing is everything.  don't expect much on a weekday, at one thirty in the morning.
 
the bar stays open until 3am, serves food until 1045pm, and weekends until 1145.  so, not your typical vegas bar that never closes. well, do bars close here, ever?
