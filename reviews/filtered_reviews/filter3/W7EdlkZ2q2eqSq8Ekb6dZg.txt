3.5 stars

considering this place is in lv...and is one of the top chef master's restaurants..i'll say it wasn't disappointing. 

I started off with the homemade white peach lemonade which was really refreshing, with the right amount of sweetness and tartness! so glad i got it. 

they give you complementary chips and 3 diff kinds of salsas yayyyy 
OH and the seating outside is overlooking the mandalay bay pool area= GORGEOUSSSSS 

i got the special of the day: tecate pork torta= satisfying and hearty. generous portion of pork and this kind of cabbage slaw thing with fries sprinkled with some kind of pepper...maybe cayenne? 'twas pricey...but i guess it was worth it. 

i would probably come back for happy hour or margheritas

p.s. i tried the food truck in la which i enjoyed...and i know there's a location in santa monica...maybe MAYBE i'll go again
