I have eaten here several times and from what I've seen, the experience at Joyride is consistent. So the positives are the atmosphere, service, and drinks. Whoever designed this place did a really great job at creating a hipster environment that is also really comfortable. There is a great outdoor seating area and all of the design choices are happy and pleasant. Service has also always been friendly and efficient. The other major upside is the drinks, which are well made, creative, and delicious. They have a nice nonalcoholic selection as well. 

The major downfall at Joyride is unfortunately the food. It isn't awful, but it's just not very good. I have had a variety of tacos, the torta, and some forgettable huevos rancheros type thing and none of it has been any good. I mean, it's edible, but it just falls so flat in flavor. Pretty much everything needs more salt and spice. Even the salsas are really quite bland. 

If they improved the food situation, this place would be five stars, no question. As it is though, I'd stick with drinks and eat at any one of the other more delicious choices within walking distance of Joyride.
