Food is always pretty good no complaints. But the last several times service has been spotty at best. 

Do you tip solely on service? 
Does service out weigh the time it takes to get your food? What if you have a good server but it takes over 30 min to get food after you order? 
This was not a place that should take that much time. #tryharder 

It has taken overly long after ordering 30 min to 40 min. Which with a 2 year old and a 4 year old can be an eternity for chicken fingers. It's crazy I know.  Also seems like they don't want you eating the chips and salsa.  I always say keep bringing them till I pass out then ever 5 min.
