The quality of the food here teeters on the line between low end dine-in and just quick fast food- the "I'm so hungry, I'll eat anything and it'll taste good anyway" kind. 
The fish tacos are good. The fish is well seasoned and fresh. The cabbage gives the tacos good flavor. Anything that makes this place stand out? No not really. But if you're hunger and looking for a place to sit down, this place will fill your tummy. I wouldn't have eaten here if it wasn't down the street from my friend's house.
