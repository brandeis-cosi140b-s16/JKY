This review is mostly about the food.  Ate here for lunch in March.  Service was good but may be due to only two tables being used in the whole place.  My wife got a breakfast burrito and I got the carne asada tacos.  both were good.  Can't complain about the food.  

The outdoor patio was nice, with a big cabana bar and tables set in sandy areas.  Overall this place seems more of a place to go at night to get your drink on.  From reading the previous reviews I can only imagine what the clientele looks like.  Based in the following I think I know.

As my wife and I were walking out to our car, some young guy was dropping off a girl at her car in the parking lot.  While I was laughing the guy in the car made eye contact with me and started to laugh too.  I just hope he was nice enough to get the poor girl breakfast!
