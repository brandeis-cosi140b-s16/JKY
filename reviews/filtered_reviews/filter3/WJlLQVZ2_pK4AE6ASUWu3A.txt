Had lunch here today. First let me start by saying the food is great. The salsa brought with chips when you are seated ( and you server acknowledges your existence) its so delicious it makes it a little hard to write this review. We had to ask the busser to take our drink order, then about 10 mins later we had to ask him to have someone come take out order. With a 3 yr old and 1 yr old in our party it was getting ridiculous. Our busser (great young guy) hurried around the restaurant doing as much as he could for several tables I saw the servers standing off to the side talking. As we waited for our food another patron was up front complaining she had only seen her server once and was NOT happy about her service. One of our water cups was dirty and when the guy came around to refill it was with carbonated water and had to give us all new water (no biggie) the food FINALLY came and the kids were beyond starving (took about 30 mins) I could understand if the place was busy but there were 4/5 tables max... The food was a little cold but tasted great. The place is clean and the decor is very nice. The music and the salsa were my favorite part. We left a nice tip (for the busser) it's sad to think this kid worked as hard as he did for a woman whom we interacted with twice to get the tip.. I'm not sure the salsa is enough to bring us back. Staff really needs to get it together even on a slow day. People that were seated after us had their order taken before us and we had to ASK to helped.
