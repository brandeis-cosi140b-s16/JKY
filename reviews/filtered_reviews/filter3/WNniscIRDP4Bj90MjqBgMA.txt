Overall, not a bad dining experience... but nothing was exemplary about it either.  I'll go back.

I am fairly consistent with what I order when trying new places that are similar to other places that I have previously been to.  What I mean by that is that unless something is highly recommended by other Yelpers, then I will typically get the steak tacos at a Mexican restaurant... and that way I can, in my own way, compare each restaurant to the others.

Anyway, there was only a very brief wait to get seated... and the service was really attentive, coming back to check on our meal, and filling up our waters often (always a big plus in my book).
