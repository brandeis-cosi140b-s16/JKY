They proclaim to have the Best Tamales but they are mehhh

I had the 2 Tamale lunch plate, Green Chicken and Red Pork.  The pork tamale was definitely better.  It was more moist and had more flavor.  I found the chicken to be dry and lacked kick.

I ordered an additional taco for $2.35 and it was decent at best.

On another visit, I had the menudo and was pretty pleased.  

The chicken fajitas were pretty tasty as well.

All in all, it's a decent spot.  3 stars....4 stars at best.  There has to be a better tamale in Vegas.....The search continues...
