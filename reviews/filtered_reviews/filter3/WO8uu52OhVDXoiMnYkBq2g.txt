Eh, it was alright. The atmosphere is ok - very family-friendly. The parking lot can get quite packed and you may have to circle it a few times. The best thing here is the view. But you can't really get close to the view as it's behind the bar and there's no tables near the massive windows overlooking the Vegas valley. They don't comp drinks at the bar, even though they do have gaming. The food definitely left something to be desired. It wasn't bad. But it wasn't exactly good either. The service was friendly and mostly attentive. All in all, not a bad spot, but it wouldn't be my pick when craving Mexican-fare.
