Not bad, but the highlight of the meal was the chips and salsa.  I ordered the shrimp chile relleno and there were maybe three shrimp in the whole dish.  Our server was really attentive, but the food was just okay, and everything was pricey.  We had a nice time, but we probably won't eat here again.
