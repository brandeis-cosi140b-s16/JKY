(Lyrics - Bruno Mars - Grenade)

Easy come, easy go, that's just how I eat
Oh, try, try, try it all and I always give
Should've known you were tacos from the first taste
Had my eyes wide open, why were they open?

Came to you with all my friends and you tossed us some shots
You tossed us some shots, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
Cause what you don't understand is

I tried the Taco Guild for ya
Throw my name on your place for ya
I'll Bo Bites my reviews for ya
You know I'd try anything for ya

Taco's in a church!?  This I had to try!

I came with my running gang to celebrate a birthday.  At first sight the place was pretty enclosed with some stained windows around.  High vaulted ceilings and the bar is up front where the altars would be.  This place was pretty cool in my book!

Complimentary chips and salsa at the start.  It was a hefty size and perfect with 4 different salsas to dip.  I ordered the Chorizo Meatballs to start.  Doused with sweet pear sauce it had a tad bit of kick as you chewed through the soft and warmly served meatballs.  For my tacos I shot for the Al Pastor Pork, Urban Bean Coffee Braised Beef, and the Chipotle Cherry Steak.  My favorite was probably the Al Pastor Pork; topped grilled pineapple, jalapeno bacon, and pickled red onions.  I didn't really care much for the Coffee Braised Beef though it did sound fun.  It was topped with caramelized onions, mango jicama relish, and cotija cheese.  The Chipotle Cherry Steak again sounded fun, but was okay at best.  It was topped with pablano straws, chile aioli, and bleu cheese.  

Overall, the place was a delight and beautifully nestled into a church.  Live bands during the weekend and service was lovely.  In the end, I would rather much prefer my street tacos...Street, but this place is a still a cool place to hangout.  Enjoy!
