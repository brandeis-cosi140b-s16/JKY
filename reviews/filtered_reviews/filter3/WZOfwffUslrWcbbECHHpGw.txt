I do prefer Fausto's over Roberto's, but it's still hit or miss. Sometimes, the food is delicious and other times, it SUCKS. I usually rave about the food, especially the Al Pastor, but during my most recent visit, the pork was not flavorful and so, so fatty. It was a real bummer since that's what I order on everything. It's my favorite choice of meat.

The good: Prices. Large portions. Pastor (sometimes).

The bad: Crowded. Inconsistent food quality and service. SOGGY FRIES.

The parking lot is terrible. Fausto's is located at the end of a shopping center corner with awkward lot positioning. That added to the rush of people in and out of this fast food joint, it's a mess. Just be careful.

Overall, mixed feelings. I won't go out of my way to visit, but if I get a hankering for Pastor Tacos, I'll consider a visit if I'm in the area.
