This place is like all the other build your bowl places with the exception of:
1) The meats are really well seasoned and tasty
2) The staff is super friendly

The atmosphere could be improved.  It doesnt give off any sort of island feel.  It actually seems empty and boring inside. 

I think I payed 12$ for a bowl with all the toppings.  A bit pricey for food thrown in a bowl if you ask me but it was good.
