An okay place for lunch. We happened to be at the Hard Rock for a pool party and decided to grab lunch beforehand. I got the fish tacos, which were okay. The nachos are pretty good though and it comes with 3 different types of salsa. I wasn't impressed by the food, but it's a nice place to hang out and have a couple beers.
