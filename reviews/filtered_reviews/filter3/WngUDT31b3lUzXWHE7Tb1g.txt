This place is a surprise. I was expecting a little hole in the wall fast food type restaurant and was blown away by how much space is available inside.

The decor/ambiance  is typical and welcoming. 

The food was great and our dishes were very large. I hate leftovers but I was happy to bring some home for lunch.

Just remember to ask for a small side of guacamole or you will end up with a weeks supply to take home.
