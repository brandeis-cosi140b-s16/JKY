This place makes me miss ASU so bad.  Hanging out with a crowd last night who were at least a few years removed from college, it really drives home the fact that life is different now.  Anyway, on to the food/drinks/experience.  TACO TUESDAY is awesome.  $2 tacos, $2 beers.  Does it get any more simple and easy than that?  I really enjoyed the tacos, as well.  The atmosphere sucks unless you love the faux Mexican beach chic theme-restaurant thing they have going there.  I didn't love the music.  It was pretty deserted, which surprised me.  Seems to me such a terrific deal should really draw people in, but apparently that's not the case, or at least it wasn't last night around 8 or so.  

I'll go back for the food whenever I get stuck missing ASU again.
