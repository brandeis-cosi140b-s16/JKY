We usually dine in when we eat at Z'Tejas, but this time decided to place a to go order.  The hostess sent me to the bar to pick it up, which I hate.  As usual when this happens, I stood at the bar with my thumb up my a$$ waiting to get the bartender's attention.  He was super busy while the hostess went back to her podium to do absolutely nothing.

The food here is decent.  One dish I highly recommend is the diablo chicken.  If not for this dish, I probably wouldn't eat there as often though.  The corn bread is a nice touch and they're not stingy about bringing more.
