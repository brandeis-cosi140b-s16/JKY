When I heard the name "Hussong's" I thought it was some type of Chinese restaurant. But paired up with the name "Cantina" threw me off as it's actually an Americanized-Mexican resto within the Mandalay Bay Shoppes. 

PERKS
+ great service (attentive staff dressed in sports jerseys)
+ gigantic drinks - they have specialties such as the "Bull Dog" (margarita + beer), but I opted for a sangria
+ FISH TACOS ($14) two mahi mahi fish tacos were fried placed upon two corn tortillas with shredded lettuce, guacamole and pico de gallo. Very fresh and decent dish. (Note: apparently the most popular item on their menu)
+ CHIPS & SALSA & GUACAMOLE - salsas were fresh! Chips were crisp and the guac was devoured by everyone!

DIRTS
- prices: although the fish tacos were a decent meal, I thought the dish was WAY over-priced for Americanized-Mexican food (but alas, it's Vegas so they'll charge a bit more)
- noisy: my co-workers and I had a little get together here, although it was nice they were able to reserve a section for us. The whole resto is a bit noisy with the sports games going on and the chatter from all the customers
- not authentic
- mediocre drunk grub

FYI
*located in mini-strip mall walk-way in between Mandalay Bay & Luxor
*you can keep the gigantic glass of margarita once you've drank it all
*laundry list of margaritas are available 
*drinks range from $8-14
*many flat screen televisions to watch the latest sports game 
*Rick Moonen's "RM" restaurant is just around the corner for sustainable seafood

I came here with my co-workers for a little get together after a meeting. I'm not sure if I'd eat at this establishment again. But for great service, good drinks and mediocre food, it's okay, but probably not my first choice.
