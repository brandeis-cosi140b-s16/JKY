I've been to Phat Burrito several times over the years and have always loved the location. It attracts all types of people in the Southend area. Hipsters, skaters, local biz owners, and Uptown bankers alike.

 There's something on the menu for everyone. Burritos, salad, quesadillas and all of the different toppings/fillings you could imagine. Upon our last visit, I decided to try out a quesadilla after getting a burrito each previous visit. Can't say that I was blown away, but it was reliable. If you're hungry and craving meat and cheese between two tortillas, you can't go wrong. 

There was something really odd about the salsas that day, too. The medium variety seemed to have a very "astringent" sensation/flavor that was very unpleasant. Typically, the salsa bar is the best party, but must have been an off day. No biggy, though. My wife tried the salad which was great. Huge torta next to a generous piling of lettuce, beans and all of the fixins'. It was a winner. 

A great little spot with great outdoor seating and mediocre seating inside. It can be a little crammed around lunchtime, so taking it to go or even eating out of your car may be in the cards. I think for the price (close to $19 for the both of us with only water to drink) in conjunction with the lack of splendor, it's not a top priority on my list to pilgrimage for lunch/dinner, but always love to stop in when on business/pleasure/errands in Southend.
