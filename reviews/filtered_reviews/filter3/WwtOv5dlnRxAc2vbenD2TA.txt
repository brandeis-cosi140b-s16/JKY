I would give this restaurant a 5 star rating however the only down side that prevents that are the front greeting (hostess) staff. The first time there my wife and I wanted to sit near the bar. The front greeting gal told us to sit at a dirty table and wait. No way!! Second time around another greeting gal wanted to sit us at the patio and we didn't even request outdoor seating. I have to say they are kinda dumb. As we were leaving we notice a lot of empty tables, a full waiting area and the greeting gals fooling around, giggling and not seating anyone. Food is great but service is meh.. Don't think we will return unless management fires the front greeting gals!
