I agree about the duck pond & the ambiance...
However the proof of the pudding is in the taste. 
On our first visit here about a month ago, we were impressed with the whole enchilada.....

However, tonight, honestly, the food was tasteless. Was it the chef's night off ? I had a salad with chicken on top and my husband had chili relleno with chicken.
I asked for another dressing ( the first one was so-so) to save it , but i guess it was the chicken that had no flavor on both our dishes, that was disappointing. 

The chili relleno had no batter, no cheese inside, just a green cooked chili with a few slices of bland chicken on top. The black beans tasted canned...The rice okay
The soup with meatballs was indeed delicious.
But I wonder, how could we like Mexican food without melted cheese ?

I have to say the service was fine and the manager did compensate us for our disappointing dinner, which was honorable. 
Will we return again ? Probably not.

PS Rubio's, which is a fast food Mexican Grill, has set the bar as far as taste is concerned for us and it costs half the price.
