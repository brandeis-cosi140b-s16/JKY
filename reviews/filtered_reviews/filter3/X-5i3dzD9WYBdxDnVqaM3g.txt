While better than a lot of other Mexican places in the area, I just can't get above thinking of it as a-ok.

The set-up is similar to other places where you order from the person who actually makes the food - and you walk down the line saying yes or no to various toppings and whatnot.

The food is definitely plentiful and large. The tortillas are delicious and the different meat options are seasoned nicely. But, overall, I still just find the tacos and enchiladas average. Their queso, however, is definitely above average. In fact, my favorite thing here is the chips and queso.
