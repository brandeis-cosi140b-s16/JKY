3.5 stars....I gotta say, the carne asada burrito was good..Its def.  not like filib's would put out, this on has sour cream , cheese, lettuce,beans and rice along with the carne asada.  I Have to admit, the asada was a little on the skimply side.. VERY skimpy...   rice was a little stale.. but all in all it was good.  Will try the street tacos next and the shrimp burrito.. Get rid of all the filler foods, give the burrito carne asada.. the little I had was incredible!  almost like americas tacos ...
