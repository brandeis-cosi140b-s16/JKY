Over priced for half decent food. I honestly think cafe rio is better but my boyfriend likes their tacos so we still come from time to time. We ordered to-go today. My boyfriend got his usual two chicken tacos with rice and beans and I got a chicken bean burrito. Half way through my boyfriends tacos he bites into a stick. A stick?!?? In his taco?!?... I don't understand. He was so hungry he still took a few more bites but couldn't finish the last one. As always, my burrito was just okay. Tortilla was way too soggy to finish. The only good outcome to this visit was my boyfriend finally agreed to never come back. Finally.
