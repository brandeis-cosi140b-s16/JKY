Pretty decent for airport food.  Quick and not bad.  Ordered combination tacos (you can mix and match) before a flight, they packed it really well - each taco was individually wrapped in a foam box and then a bag.  No messes here.

I ordered one chicken taco and one carnitas taco both in flour.  Chicken was tasty, good flavors, not dry.  The carnitas taco was greasy and not as flavorful - would not recommend.  They charged me an extra 50 cents for the combo.  Guacamole is an extra 75 cents.  Salsa verde comes with your order, but it's pre packaged and not fresh.  

I didn't have time (and the real reason I had a morning flight) - or else it looked like a great place to drink prior to take off!
