Very delicious tacos, albeit more expensive than your standard food truck taco. Ambience is very casual. Jose Andres is a god of Spanish cuisine having introduced jamon iberico to the U.S. and innovated via molecular gastronomy but Chino Poblano did not deliver against my expectations.

We ordered many dishes. The chips and salsa were one of the more memorable non-taco dishes. The carnitas with chicarrones wet yummy and the lobster tacos were a novelty. There are many restaurants in Las Vegas on the strip that provide a more memorable atmosphere and food.
