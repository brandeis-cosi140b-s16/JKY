Typical sports bar atmosphere with the Mexican food twist, but don't be fooled it's still Americanized.

They have a huge menu with many different types of foods for any of your picky friends. You're bound to find something you and your friends will enjoy! The awesome part for my friends and I is the Vegetarian and Vegan menu! Which makes choosing foods easy since I won't necessarily have to read all the ingrediants on the list if I order anything off that menu. 

We came here on a Tuesday which is Tequila and Taco Tuesdays! They have 2 for 1 shots of any of the Tequilla and 3 tacos for $6 or $7 depending on the type of meat you get. Not a bad deal! I was with a group of 10 people sooooo we decided to order food as a group and share. Basically we got the Nacho party platter, it was larger than anyone expected.....safe to say we didn't finish it, lol. I didn't get to try any of it, but everyone had their own favorite since it contained four different nachos they have. We ordered around 4-5 plates of the tacos and then the vegan nachos. 

I did try the vegan nachos and that was delicous! It had all my favorites, daiya cheese, beans, corn, mild salsa, guacamole, and fake meat =P that's all I can recall. It's enough to share between two people! 

Oh and we also got Chips & Salsa, but I requested hot salsa and I was disappointed when the hot salsa tasted like mild salsa to me. Even asked for extra habeneros but apparently they don't offer that. The waitress was kind enough to bring some other hot sauce which was good, but not spicy sooo that was a bust. 

Add a couple of rounds of drinks and we were all set! I think we stayed past closing time, but we weren't kicked out and they never said anything to us which was awesome! We didn't even realize otherwise we would have been out the door 10 minutes before closing. Props to them for letting us hang out longer without distrubing our fun!
