Okay, here we go.  My first under achiever review.  I hate to do it, but I must be honest.

Overall, the food wasn't EXACTLY bad, but it was very small.  For the price, I would have expected more on my plate.  It is priced just a tad more than the Rubios and Baja Freshes that it compares to.

The environment is a little bit cramped and (when i was there) the salsa bar was a mess.  Like I said, the food wasn't bad, but it definately wasn't outstanding.  With the prices and competition with the chains mentioned above, you would expect a LOT more.

I have visited this taco shop one time 2+ years ago and have never gone back (That says a lot).  Do yourself a favor and hit Rubios if you are in the mood for this type of food.  You'll save some coin and get tastier food (and more of it).
