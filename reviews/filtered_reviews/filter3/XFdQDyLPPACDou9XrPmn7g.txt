I've been here 3 times and each time I enjoyed the Queso Fundido.  If you don't speak Spanish, I'll translate: 
queso means 'cheese' and fundido means 'to salt the living shiitt out of'.  Expect to be thirsty for at least a week afterwards.  

The rest of the menu is mainly ok, but not great.  The staff tends to chat with themselves about their family while ignoring you, but once I had a bartender who supplied me with many types of cocktails while taking the time to explain what was in each one.
