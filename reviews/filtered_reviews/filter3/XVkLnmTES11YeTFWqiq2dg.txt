This restaurant reminds me of TQLA.  The atmospheres are similar.  The pork wrapped in the banana leaf was delicious.  Chips and salsa were good.  There was just a strange vibe overall.  The service was ok, but nothing extraordinary.  

We went for dinner and waited 45 minutes for an ok dinner experience.  It may be a good place to go for drinks at the bar with some friends.

Nothing amazing to mention, and I may return sometime.
