---Good--- Friendly service and I enjoyed the food.  I'd like to go back and try a few other items, but right now I'm kinda perturbed about this place.

---Bad---  1) This is just dumb, how could you ever think of putting push/push doors on your bathrooms? Walk anywhere near the doors and you'll be smacked.  Buy two $.89 door handles and fix the problem.

2) No ice tea or was it hidden and I had to press a magic button and the tea fairy would appear?

3)The ordering system is not unique or funny, it sucks, it blows, it makes me want to kick a puppy.    Why must I use my secret decoder ring to find the code for what I want to order for lunch?     Example: First write the number of the entree down, if you want a burrito put a "B" next to it -BUT THEY DON"T TELL YOU THAT!!!!     WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF   Why make me figure all this out when all I want is lunch.

4)Huge pictures of, what you would think to be, menu items above the register so you can order/figure out your selections. The first this she says was something like " These are not our menu items". Awesome, thanks for the mind fuck.

But the food was good.
