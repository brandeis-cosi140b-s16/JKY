Stopped by to grab a quick lunch to go. They have a very small menu, but it still took me a while to decided between the torta and burrito. Since I haven't had a torta since I was about 12 when I was visiting Mexico City, I ordered a carne asada torta and an horchata to drink. 

Service was friendly and pretty quick. The carne asada was delicious! Finally a place that serves carne asada like I grew up with. The horchata was a little too sweet, but still good. My dad still makes the best.  :)  The torta was a pretty good size, but I think it's a little expensive for lunch and a drink to go. 

It's a pretty small place with an open kitchen and seating inside and outside under a covered patio. I would stop by again if I was in the area and craving a quick meal.
