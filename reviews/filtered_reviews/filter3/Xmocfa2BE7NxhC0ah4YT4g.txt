ah Chino. I have been going here for years, well actually the other location, but same place. This location is really hard to find if you don't know where it is.... it seems like the location is not really great for their business... but I dunno. This place is good in that bad kind of way. The food is greasy, it comes out on paper plates or in tin take out dishes. It pretty much always makes me feel sick after eating there.... but I still eat there because it's just good sometimes. I always get an emerald chicken burrito and machaca quesadilla in a combo with the jerk fried rice. The emerald chicken is good.... all white meat and really oniony. It's one of the more asian-y dishes. The machaca is good too, just standard shredded beef with tomato, garlic, and onion.The BF gets bean and cheese burritos and seems to like them. I think the thing that always brings me back is the free snickerdoodles. They're sooo good....and also they are free which makes them even better. So against my better judgment, I will keep going to Chino Bandito.... 


Oh, and if you're drunk... this place gets at least one more star.
