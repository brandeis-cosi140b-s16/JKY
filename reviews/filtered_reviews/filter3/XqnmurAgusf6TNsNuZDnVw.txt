Well let's see, none of tables had been bussed.  One gentleman had been waiting for 30 minutes right and the staff continually walked past him. No one wanted to claim the table, etc.    no  apology. When someone did finally take my order, it didn't take long at all to get my food. The portion was huge!! 

I got the chicken nachos.  It had liquid cheese which I don't like and I wasn't particularly fond of the shredded chicken because it lacked flavor.
