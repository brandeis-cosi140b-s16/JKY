Get the PASTOR...

OK now that we've got that out of the way, having lived literally dozens of feet away for 3 years, this is the single most thing I miss about my name old hood. The food is a top notch hole in the wall. With my homeboy always (usually) behind the counter, the service is always friendly, and this became the go to quick dinner spot for virtually all my friends coming here for their pregame dinner (which often led to the round 2 trip, post game drunken snack). While I almost always got the pastor here, both the chicken and steak are good quality and I'm partial to the Costillas en Res con Papas (sp?) You'll see a picture of it on the menu, love the grilled jalape√±o.

Short story long, and not just because I have more than a few drunken (and sober) memories, but this is by far my favorite pastor in the city and I will always keep coming back!
