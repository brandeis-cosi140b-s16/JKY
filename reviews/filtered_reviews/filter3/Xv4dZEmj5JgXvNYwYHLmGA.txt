Came for lunch today because I had a buy one get one free nacho. Let's start off with the cleanliness of the place. Our table was really sticky and the tables menus could use a wipe down. 

For our nachos we ordered the carne asada nachos and the pulled pork nachos. Carne Asada ones were good but nothing special and priced at $16.95 I wouldn't ever come back here and order nachos. The BBQ sauce on the pulled pork nachos was to sweet. So we didn't really enjoy those. If we do return I like to try a burrito or fajitas. Positive note service here was great!
