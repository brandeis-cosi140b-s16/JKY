I want to give this place 4 stars, but the service fell short on more than one occasion. The food was great, and the entertainment they have visiting this place is awesome. Everything from local to national acts. I've made a couple group outings to this location with co-workers and on a fairly dead time of the day. The idea was that we wouldn't be competing for service since there was only one other table to tend to, but was I wrong. It took us over an hour for 8 of us to get our food and there were multiple occasions  where I would have loved to get another drink but it literally took 20 minutes to get a draft or mixed drink. I'd gladly go back, if the bartender is Alaina. She was awesome and very prompt. But keep in mind if you sit on the patio, the trend is 'out of site out of mind.'
