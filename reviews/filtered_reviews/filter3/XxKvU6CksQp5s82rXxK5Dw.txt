The patio here is so cute and fun! It was to cold to sit outside but the inside was cozy. We had to wait awhile to be seated and after waiting, the bartender finally came over to seat us. The lunch specials are a great value at $7.95. I had the taco and enchilada combo, it comes with refried beans and fideo. I got the spinach con queso inside my enchilada and it was really tasty but everything else was  average mexican food. I think the chips and salsa were the best part. They are great because you get both corn and flour tortilla chips with pico de gallo and hotter sauce. Our waitress didn't come by very often and the service was pretty slow. If I were to go here again I would definitely sit out on the patio and do chips/salsa with a frosty drink.
