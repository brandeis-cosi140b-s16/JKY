My friends and I were staying at TI for the day and after drinks, we were all starving so we saw the giant frog from our window and thought "Hey that looks like a cool place" so we headed down for lunch.

DECOR: Its a typical bar and bar atmosphere. Wasnt too loud when we went, but still there was noise. There are some funny signs on the ceiling with different funny sayings. Even the decor is "loud" but what can u expect in Vegas right??

FOOD: Food was pretty good. My friend and I had the BBQ Combo which was really good. Another friend had the Beef Fajitas which was good too, but BEWARE they charge u to get more tortillas, lame! The portions are good to share as well. 

DRINKS: All of us got two drinks that come in thos big containers shaped like a palm tree. Was good enough for the six of us and taste wise was good.

SERVICE: Our waitress was nice but not overly friendly and not as attentive as she could have been. Overall she was nice though. 

Overall it was a good experience and I would go back, but at the same time it won't be at the top of my list either, just when we are in the area.
