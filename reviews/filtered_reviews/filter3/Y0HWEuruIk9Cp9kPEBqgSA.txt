The plates are extremely over priced. The food is just okay. And the service was meh. We had a large party and were rushed out , plates were taken away even though food wasn't finished , it was just a mess. The servers were attentive . It suck because I used to be a huge fan of this place . I brought my In-laws here and I was embarrassed that I recommended this place.
