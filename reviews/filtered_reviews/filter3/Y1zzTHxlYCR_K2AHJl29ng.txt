After hearing rants and raves from the people at work I deiced to finally give this place shot. 

Okay, right off the bat, ding, 1 star! Who the hell pays for chips and salsa?!  For some thats a reason to boycott a place! Maybe its the homeless problem or the neighborhood around there, its still pretty lame!

Order a cheese crisp.. I have to say, one of the best Ive had.. super crunch, held the paid for salsa very well.. not to oily.. I could have had just this for lunch! For my entree I ordered a green corn tamale and a green chile burro with rice and beans. The green corn tamale was awesome! Super moist, cheesy and very flavorful. The rice and beans were decent enough.. the green chile burro was good but not great.. it had a strong black pepper flavor which I'm not a fan of but the meat was nice and tender. The tortilla was wonderful though.. soft and chewy and slightly charred. I think they actually make those there as I saw some other guests leaving with ziploc bags of them. 

The chunky salsa was very fresh as all the food prepared for us seemed to be. However the red sauce in the bottle tasted fermented and much like beer. When we asked if she put beer in it she said no and said that it might be going bad. She tasted it at the table (which I loved) on her finger, shrugged and walked off.. must have been alright. Still didn't taste quite right to me. 

El Bravo is decent Mexican food, close to work, cheap and comfortable. Though with so many other places in the neighborhood, Via Delosantos and Los Reyes de la Torta I don't see the need to go here to often except when I'm in the mood for a good tamale!
