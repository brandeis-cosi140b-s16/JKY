I wanted this place to be great, but it was just OK. We were seated at a table without napkins and utensils. Why?? sit us at an empty table especially when the server took five minutes to recognize us as customers.
When we asked for silverware and napkins, she said 'Wait a SEC!!" Hey, we've been here five minutes before she came over.

My wife ordered the Carne Asada and I had the Carnitas Burrito. The server asked if we wanted the Slaw; hey wait a minute, it comes with the entree; we also chose the RED SAUCE; BIG mistake. The sauce was poured over and was BITTER. I had to scrap all the red sauce to the side of my plate. My wife also agreed that it wasn't good.
Looking at the menu now, I don't remember if my burrito had the guacamole and pico de gallo in it. The carnitas, itself, was moist and  cooked just right. The Jicama Mango Slaw was very refreshing while eating the burrito.

The next time we try this restaurant I'm going to try their tacos and margarita. It looks like the name of the restaurant lives up to its billing, I just wish the burritos would have  been mucho better.
