We went on a Saturday and arrived at 11:30.  We were the first diners in the restaurant, and there were two women at the bar.  Service was quick.

The Chips and Salsa were as good as any in the area.  My wife had the grilled chicken salad and I had the Mole Poblano.  Although I enjoyed the Mole, my wife's salad was unusual with vegetables that we did not expect in a chicken salad. (squash, 2 types, etc.)

We'll go back, but that salad is off the list.

By the time we left the place was packed.
