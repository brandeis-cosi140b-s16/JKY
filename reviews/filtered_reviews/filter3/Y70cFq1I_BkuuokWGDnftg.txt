Pretty fun atmosphere, live music, etc... Chips and salsa and guacamole were good.  I had basic cheese enchiladas, that which I judge all Mexican places, and I didn't even eat 1/2, it was made with cheddar cheese and the sauce was a red vs brown sauce, not good.  So I just filled up on chips and drinks.  My companions all liked their food, but they got entrees and seafood enchiladas.
