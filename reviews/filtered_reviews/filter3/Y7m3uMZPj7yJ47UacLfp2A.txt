My fellow Yelpers reviews averaged 3  1/2 stars so I expected a decent experience.  I'll give it three stars but it really should be 2  1/2.

I showed up at Happy Hour during the week and the place was dead.  I sat at the bar and ordered the house marg with no salt and it was served as requested and tasted fine.  Later on I ordered a second one and it was served with salt.  As the place was still dead I was mildly annoyed.

The chips were warm and fresh and the salsa was bland.

Ordered Chori-Pollo and quick as a flash my entr√©e arrived but it was the wrong dish.  Lots of apologies and smiles and a second quick flash later the correct dish arrived.  It was mostly hot and tasty but the re-fried beans served as a side were cold.

When I asked for my check the friendly bartender promptly gave me another patron's check.  Once again, lots of apologies and smiles and the correct check was presented.

Overall there were too many bumps in the road and the meal was just average.  There are about a thousand places to eat and drink on Carson Street.  These folks gave me no reason to return.
