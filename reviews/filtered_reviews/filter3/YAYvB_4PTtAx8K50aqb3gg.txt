I went to this place with some friends after seeing it on Diners Drive Ins and Dives expecting something AMAZING.  While it wasn't awful, it wasn't quite as good as Guy Fieri made it sound. 

I ordered the Carnitas Quesedilla and the Jade Red Chicken combo served with jerk rice and black beans. (Way too much food for one, but I wanted to taste a few different items.) The cuban black beans were by far the best thing on the plate, nicely seasoned and a creamy texture.

I'd recommend not getting the Jade Red Chicken.  Its one of the top sellers but the crispy chicken pieces lose their crispness when dunked in the sauce and the flavor is mild when combined with the jerk rice and cuban black beans.  If you like sweet and mild, slightly soggy fried chicken pieces, then its for you. 

If I went back I'd probably stick with the carnitas or other non-fried food.
