This place is okay if you go in with the expectation that you'll be getting fast food that you can't really buy anywhere else. As for the quality, everything was extremely greasy.

We got the fettuccine noodles, a cheesesteak sandwich, and a bulgogi plate.  Each item was greasier than the last.

We saw the reviews and were really excited to try this place but it was a let down.  The price is what makes this a three. Otherwise the food alone was probably a 2 to 2 1/2 stars.
