Went to Mercadito's for the first time after hearing this was a good place to eat. Decided to go during happy hour to try more selections of tacos for a lower cost. I was seated outside. Had the mahi mahi, chicken and steak tacos. Chicken was a little salty, the steak was a little over cooked however the fish was good. The tacos are on the small side. Also tried the chips and salsa. Selected three different salsas and was surprised it was served in a small plate with small spoons. I know why the give you spoons because the corn chip wont fit in the shot glass size plate. No unsweet ice tea! Ordered a Pepsi and paid $4.00 for it. Over all this place is good and overpriced.
