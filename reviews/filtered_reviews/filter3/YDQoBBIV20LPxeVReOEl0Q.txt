Pink Taco is famous? I assumed so since many of my group members really wanted to come here. I expected something a little more spectacular or unique with their quality of food. The chips and dips were GREAT. They offer 3 different dips (guac, cilantro chili and a red one ....yeah not very descriptive but best I can do!) and the chips were fresh. I just got full of of that.
The sangria was okay as well. It tastes better the longer you leave it out and have the ice mix in. Maybe a little too strong for my taste.
We ordered the PINK TACO dish. It's their signature dish right?!? Well, everything was a little too salty. The chicken was marinated well, but I was so thirsty after. They gave a generous amount of chicken with some tomatoes and lettuce on a freshly-made flour tortilla. A corn tortilla may have been better. The rice and beans on the side were salty as well but still tasty.
The fish tacos were good as well, but the fish was a little small. I guess it fits the small tortilla.

In the end, it's really filling and you will need to.....release some of it after! It was a pleasant meal but does not live up to its reputation.

Pink Taco, youz a salty taco!
