Recently ate at the newer Elliott and Kyrene location (which was my first experience with America's Taco Shop). I am glad that I visited the other location first because had I visited this location first I am not sure I would have tried it again.  

I ordered chicken tacos at both locations and the food quality was the same, both were very good.  The down side to this location is its age. Not that it has to be completely new or updated necessarily,  but it feels very dirty.  Bugs in the light shades,  dirty window sills,  and the bathrooms smell horrible.  Unfortunately their seating is limited,  so we also had to sit next to the bathrooms... which was not a pleasant experience.  

Lastly,  I ordered guacamole at both locations.  It seemed much less flavorful here and had a consistency of yogurt (not your typical guacamole). 

I will just make the Elliott road location the one I visit in the future.  

Overall,  love the food though!
