I go to Vegas regularly and have been to many of the great restaurants.  Though China Poblano is not as costly as some, the price for what you get is costly.  Five fifty for    one taco that I can consume In 4 bites is a little high.  Though the carnitas is delicious, it is still not worth the price.  Same can be said for the 20 vegetable fried rice.  The chicken taco was ok but not memorable.  I think the 20 vegetables was match the price.  But then again, everything is a bit more In Vegas.
