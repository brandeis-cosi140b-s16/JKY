This place is disgusting. I would have lived a long happy life not having entered Loco Patron. The crowd is creepy alcoholics, douchey jock stereotypes, frat boys and sad, hysterical hos. The inside is so dark you can barely see the person opposite you and the tone of the place is set when you arrive for dinner at 7PM and are CARDED. 

So why on earth am I giving this place 3 stars? Well it's really 2.5 but honestly the food was solid, middle of the road tex mex and the portions were large for their price, making the meal I had a value. The $6.50 quesadilla with green chilies was made with what can only be described as the world's largest tortilla. It had to be a 30" one because it was folded over and still looked enormous. There wasn't too much cheese in it, but enough to not feel stingy, though the accompanying guac and pico de gallo was not nearly enough for the magnitude of that quesadilla. We were in on a Tuesday night which is $1/$2 taco night and I did try the mahi mahi taco on the soft corn tortilla and liked it. I don't really like mahi mahi because it's regularly cooked to death and tastes like nothing, but the topping made it a nice $2 treat. 

If someone brought this food to your house and served it to you without telling you where it was from you would enjoy it. But Loco Patron is a charmless restaurant/bar that should be avoided.
