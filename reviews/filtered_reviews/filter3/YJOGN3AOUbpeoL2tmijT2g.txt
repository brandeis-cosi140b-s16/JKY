Mmm pink taco. Wait a second.... What a disgusting name. You know a MAN started this business!

Anywho, after a long morning of drinking at the beautiful Hard Rock pools, one needs to recharge and refuel themselves for the obnoxious amount of drinking that will occur later that evening. Pink Taco is a fun place to run into for lunch for a decent meal. With a name like Pink Taco, you know that everything is going to be just a little hyper sexualized.... Oh and the menus are pink and glittery. Sold.

I'm a huge fan of the Chicken Tostada Salad... Crispy romaine lettuce with grilled chicken, avocado chunks, black beans and some really good chipotle dressing. I've also tasted a few of the other dishes my friends got. I like my salad more but it was still tasty... or maybe I was just too tipsy to really care. Look it's obviously not going to be authentic Mexican food so don't harp on that. Many things in Vegas are not authentic. You would know this if you took a look at some of the "women" on the outskirts of the strip... yeah, you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about.

Overall I think Pink Taco is a fun place for lunch in the hotel that isn't that overpriced! I've never been for dinner or happy hour but whenever I walk by at night it looks like a wild party inside. Oh and keep a look out for coupons or specials online. The last time I was there these two guys gave us their coupon so we got our meal at 50% off! Woot woot.
