For starters, it's dark as hell inside. They never asked if we wanted to be indoors or out. That sucked. Ambience and design is cool. Lots of dark wood, bright copper and adobe. Our server was very good and attentive.  My draught beer was flat but I left it at that. Ordered only one. 
I can't stand booth seating unless at a diner so I was somewhat uncomfortable the entire time. 
Food was good. I got the tacos ala carte. Pork and the tilapia were very good but the lamb was nasty grizzly.  Rice and beans were tasty and cooked just right.  My one daughter's brick oven pizza was well liked and my other daughter's skewers were great. My wife's shrimp quesadilla was over the top great according to her but she was buzzed!
I'd say Richardson's would be an excellent place to bring or meet friends but as for families or business clients, not so.
