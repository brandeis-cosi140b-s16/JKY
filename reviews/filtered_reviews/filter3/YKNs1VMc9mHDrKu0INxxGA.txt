I've been here twice in the past 3 weeks.

The first time was for a huge girl scout leader award dinner.  We had our food catered and it was delicious.  They gave us more than enough food and the service was fine--nothing special.  I probably would have given it a 4-star rating.

But last week we came here for a happy hour/good bye party and it was awful!!!
When I came in a little late, I went straight to the bar for my drink.  It's a good thing I did because the bartender was also our server and I later found out that he hadn't even served our table their drinks yet.  So I received my drink before everyone else who had been there a lot earlier than I had.

The bartender was extremely rude and unhappy.  He seemed flustered the entire time.  I'm not sure why we didn't have another server out there since there were about 20-30 of us.  The restaurant was pretty empty besides us.  This was a Thursday at about 5pm.

I went to the bar to order my food since all my friends were complaining about how slow he was with ordering from the table.  Luckily I think a manager came by and saw me waiting at the bar, so he took my order.  I ordered the street tacos from the happy hour menu.  Yuck.  I didn't care for them at all.  I just ate the carne asada off the taco.

My margarita was okay, but I had to repeatedly go to the bathroom to wash my hands because the syrup must have been all over the glass making my hands sticky.

The floor was also gross and sticky.  My shoes were sticking as I walked.

My biggest complaint however, was that they would not honor their happy hour prices for us.  Their reasoning was because we had such a big group.  I think that is ridiculous and unfair.

I plan a lot of happy hours for my work, and I will never plan one for here again.  They will be missing out on a lot of business.  Oh well....

It's too bad because I have heard that they have really good food.  I just don't think I'll be here again.
