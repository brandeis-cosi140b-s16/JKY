We had dinner here during a convention trip, and it wasn't half bad. If you're staying at the Luxor, make sure you use the coupons for BOGO on beers! We ordered 5 different dishes, and they were all Decent, but nothing to write home about. Just average cookie cutter Mexican food. Ask for their Hot sauces if you like a little spice! They're homemade, spicy and delicious!
