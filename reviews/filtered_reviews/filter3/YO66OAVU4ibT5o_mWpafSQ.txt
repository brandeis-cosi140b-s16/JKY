I have very mixed feelings about this place.  I reviewed the McKellips location a couple times....once a great review, and once a bad review.  Now, we've been to the Gilbert location a few times now on Saturday for happy hour, while my sons at his guitar lesson.  Their house margaritas are really good....and cheap during happy hour (3 or 4 bucks I think).  Their chips and green salsa are also very good....but you have to pay for them in the bar...at least during happy hour.  Had the nachos once, but realized the beans aren't vegetarian so I won't be having them again.  I'm sure we'll go again for happy hour, but that's probably about it.

One thing I absolutely love is the decor!  So cute and charming!  Love it!
