My wife and I were craving mexican and happen to be in the dilworth area.  We decided to stop and give them a try.  Just for some background information, we love mexican.  Biombo's in concord is our favorite and for in charlotte we enjoy loco lime.  

I will say that this is not a bad place.  I gave them 3 stars because this is not the mexican food that we enjoy.  First we ordered the Queso with our chips.  This is not the regular white queso that many mexican restaurants want.  This is more of an authentic queso, it has onions and is slightly brown compared to white that we are use to.  So my wife nor daughter really liked that.  

We all got burritos and thought they were ok.  The carne assata did not have the best flavor and just was not the best one I had.  

I do not think this place is bad and could see how people would love it.  I think it is just not my cup of tea.  On a better note the table service Guacamole looked great.  If i ever find myself back I will give it a try. 

For regular visits I will stick with Loco Lime and our number one favorite Biombo's
