Amazing number of burrito choices!  I had the green chili burrito (only $3.65!) which was standard chili sauce, with chunks of tender pork.  There wasn't a LOT of meat, but for $3.65, it was a nice value.
I also had their Mexican Chicken Soup, which was fairly unique.. it was very flavorful, and included a generous amount of cheese, and crema fresca..  
My parents had fish, and shrimp tacos.. those tacos are HUGE! heh. 
The staff didn't quite seem to be firing on all 8 cyls, and the dining room needed a serious sweeping/wipe down.  I guess they are in the process of adding a patio, and doing some remodeling, so that may have something to do with it.  Also, I was impressed with their tea selection.. two types of Tazo iced tea! :D Great place for a quick, inexpensive meal.
