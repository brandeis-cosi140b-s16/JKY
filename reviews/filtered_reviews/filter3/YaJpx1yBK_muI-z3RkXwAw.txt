Macayo's is yet another Mexican place in the valley which is just right there on the line with what I consider "average" Mexican food. There's nothing wrong with being average; it just isn't something I'd want to be known for. 

It's the type of place where, if you live close by it'll probably work in a pinch if you're in the mood for Mexican... you just won't leave wowed. There's nothing wrong with the food, it's alright... just not unique or fresh enough to really cause you take notice. Comparatively there are places like 'Rosas' in Mesa which have flavorful dishes that actually stand out and make you want to go back. 

This location has been pretty consistent, and the wait staff are fine; I just can't justify going here more than once in a blue moon when there are quite a few other Mexican places that have much healthier and flavorful options for about the same price.
