Huge burritos at this joint, they have plenty of vegetarian options as well.  The naked chicken and rice burrito was delicious and it had an organic flavor.  The graffiti outside the place reminds me of that soulful Philly graffiti that I love.  This little corner restaurant is fun, go out on the patio and enjoy a burrito.
