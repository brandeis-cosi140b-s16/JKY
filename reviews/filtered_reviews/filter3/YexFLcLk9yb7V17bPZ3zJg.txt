This review calls for the good, the bad, and the ugly! 

I came here on August 18th with my friend Lindsey. We got here around 12:30am due to the fact that she got off at midnight. 

The good: 1) they're open late, till 2am. Perfect for those of us who work on the strip! 2) Happy hour! 3) The food! We got a bunch of different tacos to share between us   and they were all delicious! We also got an order of ceviche and bacon wrapped jalape√±os and we weren't disappointed!

The bad: I wish I'd caught the hostess's name because she didn't seem like she wanted to be there. I got there before my friend and went inside to grab a table for us and when I approached her she gave off the vibe that I was inconveniencing her. She tried sitting me at a table right next to a speaker and I politely asked to be seated at a different table and she rolled her eyes but fulfilled my request. I'm hoping that she was just having a bad day and this isn't her attitude on a regular basis. 

The ugly: Apparently Tuesday's are taco Tuesday's which involves a dj. However the music was so loud it was almost unbearable. I asked the server if the music could be turned down a little and he said no because that's the way management wants it. I'm all for music but it needs to enhance your experience, not take it over. I couldn't even have a conversation with my friend. We would have gotten another round of drinks if the music had been turned down just a little. 

Will I be back? Maybe. I love the food and the fact that they're open late but the dj and the loudness of the music kind of ruined it.
