So it was our first time here, upon walking in the place smelled of sewer and found out one of their bathrooms broke. So once we were able to pick a table we sat far from the bathroom and near the door which helped a lot with the smell. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. They even brought us out chips and salsa while we waited for our food.
I wanted to try a sample of a few different things so I got 3 Street Tacos. A steak, a grilled chicken, and chipotle shrimp. My husband got the Steak Torta with Fries. And we got a Horchata to wash it all down.
The Torta was okay, the Fries were delicious, they season them with cilantro and parmesan, nice and crispy, not greasy. My tacos were just okay as well, their free salsa bar helped them out, the steak and chicken were cooked nicely but lacked flavor/seasoning. The tacos had plenty of meat in them. The shrimp taco was a huge fail, the shrimp had the chipotle sauce on them but had zero taste and an odd consistency, I wouldn't recommend those. The Horchata was yummy.
I'll give them another try since they are so close to work.
