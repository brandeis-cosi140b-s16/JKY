Barrio Cafe was pretty good, but a bit pricey for what they deliver. When I got there it was completely packed, and due to the very small amount of space in the restaurant, a bit hard to navigate through. 

My table started off with a bunch of appetizers. I found it interesting that they made the guacamole right in front of us, but I couldn't help but think that it was just a gimmick to justify the $11 price tag (and no, it wasn't a lot of guac, just one avocado). The server was nice enough though, albeit a bit rushed, and the flavors were very good. I especially like the tapenade; it was superb. 

After the apps came the main courses. I have to respect a place that has a passion for seafood in the middle of the desert. A large portion of Barrio's menu consisted of different variations of shellfish and fish. I ended up ordering the torta with crab meat and chicken. It was pretty good, but I felt that the crab overpowered the whole sandwich, even with the hollandaise sauce that cover nearly every bite. It had a lot of potential, but I'm not sure that I would order it again. On the flipside, I tried their chicken enchiladas and those were great. They are served in a small skillet and they are buried in a sea of delicious toppings. I'm glad Barrio could do this classic some justice and add it's own spin on it.

After taking my last few sips of sangria we began to part from Barrio Cafe with leftovers aplenty. Four people, a $200 tab and the satisfaction of trying a new place. I'm glad I got to go, but I'm not sure when I will be returning. Some people may really enjoy it, some may not.
