The food is awesome, 5 stars. Never had a bad tasting meal. 

Their service leaves you wanting to eat else where, 2 stars. Not sure how they always have 8+ people working but no one is working to get the customers food out hot. From the time the food came out of the oven it was over 5 minutes until we had paid and we still had to get drinks and silverware before we could eat. And on top of everything, the restaurant was freezing cold which only adds to the food getting colder faster. 

Whenever I go, it's always with the expectation of cold food. Thank goodness the quality of food is good and makes up for it ALWAYS being cold.
