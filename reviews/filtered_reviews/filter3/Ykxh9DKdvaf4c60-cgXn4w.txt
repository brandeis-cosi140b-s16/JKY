This place is a hit and miss. When I havent had it for awhile, its amazing! When I've had it too much, its a miss. I am a regular though and quite a creature of habit. I do love their chiccharones tacos, those are addicting. I'd skip their seafood tacos (the shrimp is rubbery and a little slimy and tastes like it was just defrosted). My other favorite here is their carnitas tacos, those are pretty amazing! The salsa bar could be a little better. When you order chips and salsa, make sure you ask for fresh ones.... they tend to be hours old and stale- best to ask for a new batch. Great atmosphere, customer service is pretty good.
