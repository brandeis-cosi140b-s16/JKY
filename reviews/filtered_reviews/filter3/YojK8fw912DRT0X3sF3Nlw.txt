This was my first experience here I felt the restaurant had too many lights on it was very bright and took away from the ambience .
The music was really good by a live band. Was not too loud
I ordered the shrimp Fajitas it was delicious but the shrimp were not jumbo size as it was advertised , lots of onions more than I expected. 
The dessert is what I really enjoyed the fried ice cream was on fire , enough for two people. Absolutely delicious. .
