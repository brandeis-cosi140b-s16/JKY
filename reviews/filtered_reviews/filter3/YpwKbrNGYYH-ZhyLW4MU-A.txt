I didn't eat anything here other than some chips and salsa so I am not sure how the food is but I can tell you all about the drinks!  They have lots of different margaritas and they are only ok.  The taste was average but they price was very high, I mean I know its Vegas and all but come on!  The beer menu was fairly good, they have all the crappy normal beers but also some good local-ish beers.  Being from San Diego we are picky about beer and like to see things other than the usual so we were happy that we got to try a few new things.  The salsa was also just ok.  Service was also just average.  I did like the decor and atmosphere of the bar.
