Overrated!!!! We heard that these tacos are the best in Las Vegas so me and my Girlfriend decided to check it out... It's way off the strip and its like you walked into Paisa Heaven! There was Moms and Tia's who just got out of a quince√±era, paisas outside bumping corridos peeling out in there old dropped on switches Chevys! But I'm from the hood of LA Highland Park to be exact so that's like going home for me! Anyway we stood in a long ass line, we got tacos de cabeza, Adobado and asada. The cabeza was on point really good!!! The Adobado was ok I think your paying for the show of el compa taquero cutting the meat of the spinning rack and dumping all that guacamole and chile on it and it makes you believe your in TJ show! It was just ok nothing spectacular or anything! The Asada was bad! The best part about that taco is the tortilla and the guacamole other than that it Taste dry like it was boiled asada... I've had asada 10 times better from one of our mediocre taco trucks in LA! So it was ok but nothing to drive way off the strip for! To be honest I'd rather go to Tacos Mexico by the stratosphere if they we're open That late.
