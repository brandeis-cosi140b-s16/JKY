This was decent, but felt like we were mostly paying the premium for being on the strip, not for quality of food. Acceptable, but with so many other options, I wasn't very impressed. The drinks were tasty, but the enchiladas I had were merely ok. Service was good, but the restaurant wasn't full at the time.
