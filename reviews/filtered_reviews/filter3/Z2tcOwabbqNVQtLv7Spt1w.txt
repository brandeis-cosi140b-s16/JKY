While Arriba Mexican Grill may be exclusive to Arizona, it's desire to be a major chain may be what keeps it average.  In an area that has an abundance of Mexican establishments (both on the low and high end), very little about Arriba stands out in the crowd.

The several odd things about the restaurant stick out like sore thumb.  What's with the New Mexico theme?  Having only driven through the state, I'm not sure if New Mexican has its own culinary style.  I always just assumed that like many other southwest states, New Mexico just fit into Tex-Mex.  The menu being exclusively pictures is a turn off.  Makes me feel like I'm at an Ihop or Denny's.  And having the descriptions in a small white text over a black background in a dim room made it very hard to read.  They also seated patrons near the bar, and left the main dining section fairly empty.  I don't know if they were short staffed, but I notice as I was leaving that there was a wait, even though I was able to see that the dining room had several empty tables.

The service was excellent.  The waiter was friendly and our drinks were constantly refilled.  The ambiance isn't bad.  We were seated next to an open sliding door which showed off an outdoor water fall/pond setup.  Chips and salsa were at the the table immediately.  The spicy was wonderful.  The mild was okay.  The bean dip was awful.  The food was also pretty good.  While it tries to be different, it doesn't seem to stand out.
