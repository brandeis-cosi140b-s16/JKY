When I travel, I usually have all of my meals planned out because I'm just like that. My trip to Milagro was a little bit of a hail Mary - I got skeeved out at the last minute by reviews of the other restaurant I had planned to try, and ended up trying to find the closest Mexican restaurant to my hotel that didn't sound scary.

I ended up sacrificing good food reviews for a place that didn't get rated down for being dirty. I can say that Milagro had a great atmosphere, and was very clean and comfortable.

The chile verde tacos were good, as was the guacamole. My dining companion had a salad, which she enjoyed. I was impressed with the tequila selection, although I didn't get a chance to try any of them.

Milagro was just a very nice, middle-of-the-road Mexican restaurant - worth a visit if you are close by and not sure where else to go, but I'm not sure I would seek it out.
