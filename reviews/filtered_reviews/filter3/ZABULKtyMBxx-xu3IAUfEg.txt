MY GOD! the happy hour 3-7pm margarita's are STRONG

As for the food so far the only thing I ever order is a chicken fajita salad and so far they are always OK but they differ slightly each time. This time was less chicken and much more fried onions but it was still OK with the white meat chicken fresh and not greasy. I tasted the guacamole from my husbands plate and noticed it had some sour cream mixed threw it and I don't remember noticing that before.

I did notice they have some new menu items such as grilled chicken with mixed vegetables and some sort of (I think) fish burrito. A new side option is jalapeno cream cheese.

My husband had one of the combination plates he said it was OK and didn't think the margaritas were as strong as I thought.

Service from Jose was excellent!

Popo's is not the best but also not the worst you can do MUCH WORST in this area.  I do bet Popo's makes the strongest $3.00 happy hour margarita's anywhere!
