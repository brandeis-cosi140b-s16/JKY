If I would have known this was in a hotel, albeit a boutique hotel, I would not have come here to eat.  

I ordered a carne asada taco, while it was small, it wasn't what I normally expect for street style tacos.  The tomato topping was good, but I would have preferred the typical onions and cilantro.  

The breakfast burrito was a big disappointment.  It was composed mostly of tortilla which kind of killed the flavor.  Lacking in the chorizo, egg and potato department.  The ingredients just didn't taste fresh.  Sure it was night time and I was trying to have breakfast, but it was offered all day on the menu.

I do have to say the Prickly Pear Margarita was pretty good.  I could keep drinking those all night, I just may not have a good morning the next day.
