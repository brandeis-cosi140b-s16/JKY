It's all about the sizzle, not the steak, at PVBC.

The burger itself is small and not very flavorful, if you get just a burger and apply pedestrian toppings. There was a bun - not much to say about it.

They're doing a neat thing with the fancy toppings, but when you consider overall value of what you get for your money, combine that with the hype, consider what you can get elsewhere, it's just not worth what you pay.

For the more mathey, that equation looks like this:
 $V = ( q+h )  { c   *

or: 
dollar value of quality plus hype is less than competition

* no 'less than' symbol for yelp text fields, how lame
