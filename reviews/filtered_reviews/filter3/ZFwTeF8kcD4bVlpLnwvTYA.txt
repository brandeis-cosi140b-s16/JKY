If I could give them 3 1/2 stars I would. The atmosphere is cool and they have a good patio. Also nice they have a small parking lot which is convenient as parking in that area can be painful sometimes. 

The brussel sprout nachos are amazing  and they really are a must order. I love all the sauces that they bring you as well. We've tried a few types of the tacos and haven't been impressed yet. The pork one was way too sweet and I couldn't even eat it. I also found the salmon one to be overcooked and blah. 

I've only been twice now so maybe they'll get better. I do plan to go back as I do see potential in this place.
