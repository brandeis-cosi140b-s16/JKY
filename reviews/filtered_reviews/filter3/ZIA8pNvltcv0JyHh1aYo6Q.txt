Senor Frog's is modeled after spring break in Cancun. If that is the premise behind the bar then they hit the nail on the head. The blaring music, copious amounts of drinks, and grinding on the dance floor screams college. 

As a stop on our long journey of bars to visit, SF was not the most impressive. We had more fun in the outside bar. The stools that resembles girls' rear ends with funny expressions was one of the highlights of the night. They provided us with many pictures to sum up the whole experience. Inside the jams were bumping and the balloon hats gave us more photo ops.

It is part of the TI trifecta, but not a place to go to on its own.
