Just stopped in for tacos, which were good.  Will stop again to try a burrito since it is the burrito house!! Very nice gal at the counter.  Quiet and parking right in front is nice.  
Horchata is made in house according to the cashier, so expect rice bits in yours! A little on the sweet side for me though.
