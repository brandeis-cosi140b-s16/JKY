For having 'Phat' in the name, their portions were kind of on the opposite side of the scale. At least for the adobada torta I ordered and devoured in point four seconds. It was a very good quality sandwich, don't get me wrong. The bread was nicely pressed and the meat was nicely seasoned, it's just for the price, it left me wanting more. The torta itself was just a little over half the size of a regular torta that you would find in any taco spot and it didn't come with any chips or anything that would substantiate the experience to equal something that felt like a full meal. I would say that this place has potential but as for now, Phat Phrank's is a misnomer and is very misleading to us hungry lunch patrons. But then again, maybe Phrank stay's Phat because he keeps the other half of our meals for himself.
