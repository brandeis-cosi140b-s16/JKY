Not my favorite. 

With that being said, the place is really authentic ole school Mexican. The service is very fast and efficient. We had no less than 4 different people bring drinks, food, clear plates. Impressed. 

Food:  the server suggested the Tia Esther- I had with chicken. Thought it was going to be spicy- nope. It was ok. The beans are ok as well. I did like that a scoop of Guac came with the plate. My husband had the Colorado burrito and added onions. very tasty- the meat was chunky not ground or shredded. 

House margaritas were good- most house margs are made with lots of sour mix- not these. Felt they were the 'skinny' marg. tasty.
