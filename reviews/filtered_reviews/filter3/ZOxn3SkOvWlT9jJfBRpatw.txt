We went to this restaurant expecting Russian and Mediterranean restaurant fare so it came as a surprise to find the menu has been expanded to include American and Mexican fare at the expense several dishes we wanted to try.  Since we were the only customers on a Sunday evening, I would hazard a guess that the menu changes are an attempt to attract a wider customer base.  We began with a delicious beet salad that included both cabbage and seasoned carrots followed shortly by varenki, Russian style dumplings generously filled with melt-in-your mouth potatoes and sour cream.  For an entree my wife ordered schnitzel, an Israeli style chicken fillet that had been rolled in panko and fried, adding a small house salad at a nominal cost. I chose beef stroganoff served in a cream and mushroom sauce.  Both entrees included a good sized portion of roasted young potatoes that were delicious.  Unfortunately the entrees were less successfully with the beef being a little too tough and the chicken on the dry side.
