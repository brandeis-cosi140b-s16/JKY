My boyfriend is from San Francisco and I am from Atlanta, but we have lived in Charlotte for about a year now. Unfortunately, we have yet to find Mexican food here that satisfies our high standard cravings. We ventured to Cantina 1511 last weekend to give it a try. It was definitely good, but not nearly as divine as the delicious authentic Mexican restaurant in my hometown or the amazing California burritos that my boyfriend is accustomed to from back home. We ordered a pitcher of the house margaritas after wavering over whether or not to make the investment. Unfortunately, our $28 pitcher of margaritas almost entirely consisted of super-sour mix rather than much tequila. We decided to try the guacamole, made table side by our waiter. He asked how much spice did we want, to which I said, "a little bit." Apparently, I should have asked him to make it as spicy as possible - it barely had any kick to it and was less flavorful than Harris Teeter's guacamole (and definitely no Chipotle, either). It was Saturday evening, but our waiter seemed very busy. He slowly refilled our chips and drinks. Yes, I understand that it was peak busy hours, so I can cut him some slack for that. I ordered the entree salad topped with chicken. It was quite delicious! Flavorful, tender chicken, fresh veggies, and a nice mix of cheese and spicy-ish ranch dressing. It was also enormous - definitely get bang for your buck there. I couldn't finish it. My boyfriend had the Mexican Barbequed Pork plate, which was essentially carnitas. It came with only three flour tortillas, but a nice convo of rice, beans, guacamole, and pico de gallo. He enjoyed it, but it was nothing memorable. All in all, Cantina 1511 is certainly decent, but basically only on par with my expectations for a Mexican restaurant in North Carolina.
