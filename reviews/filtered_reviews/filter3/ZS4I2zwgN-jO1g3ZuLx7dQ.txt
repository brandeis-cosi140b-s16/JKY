It's so sad I have to change my review. First we walk in and as we waiter a table a lady is talking to what looks like a manager about finding a hair in the god. Uh ok anyways we get our table. The server takes forever! His assistant did most of the work. I got a refil after it had been empty for 10 min. We had to ask for soup, which was served the same time as our food. My mother in law got nachos which was just cheese and jalape√±os. No beans? I could've made those nachos at home. I'll be going somewhere else for Mexican food :/. It was nice knowing ya for 10 yrs
