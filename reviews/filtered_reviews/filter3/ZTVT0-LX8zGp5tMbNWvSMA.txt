I had higher expectations for this place based on the reviews.  My son had a burger that was huge and he enjoyed it.  He was excited most about the marinated onions on it.  He usually hates onions and really enjoyed them that way.  I didn't think the chips were that great.  My girls got the kids meal chicken strips.  They came out looking hand made but burned.  The employee was kind enough to get us a second order but the kids still didn't like them.  I had the egg sandwich and thought it was just okay.  They forgot to put any cheese on it.  I missed that but it still didn't excite me.  They did have yoo hoo and the girls were happy about that.

OH and I saw a maple bacon milkshake on the menu.  LOL!  Ick!
