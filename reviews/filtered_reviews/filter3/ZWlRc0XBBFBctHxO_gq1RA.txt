Husband & I went for dinner one Sat nite followed by breakfast the next morning while staying at the Hilton down the street. The spinach & chicken enchiladas were to die for, but the other three meals were mediocre. Service was unimpressive due to MIA and apathetic servers both times. Three stars for cute southwestern patio & enchiladas.
