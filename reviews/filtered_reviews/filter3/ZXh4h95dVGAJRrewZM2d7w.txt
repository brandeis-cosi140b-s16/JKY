The Skinny: tried their beef, chicken, pork belly, fish taco - would only recommend getting 1 out of 4 (3) Service: good and prompt (3) Value: given we'd only order 1 dish out of four again, I think we'll pass on this (3).

I'd been wanting to try this place out for a while given everything that I've read and heard about this place. Finally, they opened a location close by my hood? Game on.

So we ordered their beef, chicken, pork belly and fish fusion tacos to start.

We were served up the complimentary chips, salsa and guacamole which was decidedly meh. I forgot to take a picture of the guacamole but it was brown and relatively bland. The salsa was alright but nothing special. The chips were clearly their homestyle fried corn tortillas which were overly thick and greasy.

The fusion tacos we ordered were quite filling and the serving size is quite large. All the tacos were topped with shredded cabbage and tomatoes (FYI, I thought the tomatoes rather flavorless pale beefsteak tomatoes - not a of which I was not a fan.) There was a little too little meat per veggie ratio in the taco for my tastes.

The fish in the fish tacos had a really tough coating on it and missing a nice light sauce on top to tie everything together. I found it overall to be too dry.

The pork belly and the chicken tacos were okay - both had a hit of smokiness however they were oddly underseasoned for Korean food. I expected big flavor hits of chili paste and sesame oils... which weren't there.

The best thing we tried was the bulgogi taco which was good - it was seasoned right and had a good amount of grilled flavor to it.

Overall, given that we only really thought 1 dish was good out of 4, I think we'll pass on this place even though we were glad to finally check out what all the fuss was about (3 starred review).
