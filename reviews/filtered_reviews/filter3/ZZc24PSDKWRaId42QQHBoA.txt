Valle Luna has been our choice for Mexican food for years. Today was the one and only time they disappointed us. 
They have added a new menu and when the waiter asked me if I wanted grilled or shredded chicken. 
The waiter said grilled is better so I said ok 
  Without telling me that it was two dollars extra 
Just to grill. The point is I felt like I was being taken advantage of for more money. It's not the money it's that telling someone is the right thing. The burrito bowl was so and for the price it's mostly lettuce
