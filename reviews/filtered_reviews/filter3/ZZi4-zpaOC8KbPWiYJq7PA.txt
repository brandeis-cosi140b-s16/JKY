We are Mexican Food LOVERS and were really looking forward to trying this place.  The tequilas are impressive and drinks were great.  Food however was very bland.  Salsas were timid, and the chipotle tasted more like liqid smoke than roasted peppers.  My husband's mole was liek a roast chicken dinner with a mild peanut sauce.  The food was not offensive, but did not capture the complexity and depth of really good Mexican cooking.  So disappointing! Service was fine.
