- the food is O.K., seems like americanized version of mexican food
- the waitstaff is hurried.  they smile politely, although it's not genuine
- the cost is GIANT for what you'll receive, so be prepared to pay more for less
- the atmosphere is bland, and worthless

I will be recommending friends/family that they avoid this place.  This could all be solved with prices 40-50% lower, although I doubt they will comply.

Bottom line:  don't bother
