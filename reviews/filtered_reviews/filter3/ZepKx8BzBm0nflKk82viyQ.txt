Not your typical "authentic" Mexican restaurant, but my experience was ok. In all fairness, I would have to come back & give this place another try...food wise. 

I ordered their house Margarita & it was very good. Nice amount of tequila with the fresh lime after taste. Refreshing!!  Chips n salsa are just ok, as the salsa is a bit on the watery side, but good flavor. 

I need to come back & try a Mexican dish, as I went for a salad because it was already 10pm and wanted to eat something light. I went for their Grilled Shrimp Green Fields Salad with Jicama & Strawberries. It was just "ok". Very bland tasting & no kick of flavor in the dressing. I was disappointed. I had to add salt, pepper & salsa to kill the boring blandness!! The grilled shrimp were fine though, cooked perfectly. Edible & not tough or chewy. My friend ordered the Grilled Chicken Salad with Mango & Jicama. Her salad was tasty & had flavor. 

Skip the shrimp salad & go for something else!! 3 stars for ambiance, service & drinks. I will come back though & give this place another shot.
