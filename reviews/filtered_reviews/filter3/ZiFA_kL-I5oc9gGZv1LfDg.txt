I'd have to say that my experience was average. The good things- the guacamole  was very good, the margarita that I requested with Hornitos was very good (and strong). The pre made Patron margarita was also good, and I'd definitely get the chicken flautas again. The bad- the avocado fries- they sounded good in theory, but had a cardboard type taste. Also the strawberry margarita that was on happy hour for $3, was very weak, like a strawberry slush.
