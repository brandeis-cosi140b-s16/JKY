Usually I like Gecko Grill but as of lately it's been hit or miss.  Sometimes my food comes out right away and tastes great. Other times the food is bland and take forever to arrive.  The service is usually not that great. It has taken up to half an hour before a server ever stopped by our table to take our order.  Then another 45 minute wait for the food to arrive... Don't go there if you are hungry and want to eat anytime soon.
