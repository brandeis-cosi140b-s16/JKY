Stumbled into this place, and nooooo!! fellow yelpers, I was not drunk. 
I would think I was after paying for this meal, talk about still being hungry. 
A simple chicken single taco with only a few bits of chicken and I think I piece of onion was $5.50, and that's because it was on the special menu. My har gow which is one of my favorite dish was not worth $16.00, I should have walked over to Earls Sandwich, which was my first choice, but me being a foodie/ foodsnob, trying Jose Andres restaurant sounded like a good idea. 
Oh wells, I ended up having CPK at the airport for a filling BBQ salad. Since I had a 3 hour delay!! Augh!!
