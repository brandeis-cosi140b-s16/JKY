It's been awhile since we've dined here. The only gripe I have is the price has gone up significantly on their entrees. None the less I always enjoy their shredded beef with chimichanga, burritos, etc. they have been consistent on the taste. The shredded beef is like dried meat & usually other Mexican food shredded beef are greasy or too much Ah Jus & they kill it with salt properties.
