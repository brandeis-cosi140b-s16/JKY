Reminds me of Paco Tacos. They definitely put the "rock" in Rock Taco with the loud music. It's not the ideal date night or girls' night out when you really want to talk or gossip. It's a place that you'll enjoy if you want to be distracted by watching a game at their bar, listen to a live band, or stay engaged on your entertainment device. 

The food was okay, nothing spectacular, but enjoyable nonetheless. However, I do not recommend their guacamole; it was bland and flavorless. On the flip side, I will recommend their salad with grilled veggies. The chipotle ranch dressing packed a punch!
