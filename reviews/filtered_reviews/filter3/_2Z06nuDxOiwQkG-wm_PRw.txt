I have to amend my review.  Where the food is great, the service the last three times i have been has been pretty mediocre.  No one cares about the customer, lets just move as many people around as you can.  The lack of an adult at the counter contributes to the poor attitude with the employees.  No one over 23.  Not dissing on that age group, they just dont get real customer service.  I come here 2 times a week, but its time to find a new favorite restaurant, one that appreciates me as much as I appreciate the food there.  The combination of Chinese and Mexican food with Jamaican just works here.  Try the Chile Rellano, one of the best I have ever had.  I love coming here.  The Jerk Fried rice is out of this world and topped with their special hot sauce?  Words cannot describe.  I love this place.
