My friend and I stopped here for lunch recently and we quite enjoyed the atmosphere upon walking in.  We were both pretty famished so we ordered the Carnitas en Chile Verde.  But while it was super tasty it was quite hard to eat with the chips because the carnitas came in huge pieces that hadn't been split or cut up.  Both of us figured if this is an app to be eaten with chips, it should be user friendly...but instead we had to use our forks, cut it up on our plate, and then scoop it up with the chips.  Annoying.

The two of us went for their 3 street taco plates so we could try as many flavors as possible.  I had the carne asada chorizo azul (but was given carne asada...grrrrrrrrr), bario pollo, and pescado.  The bario pollo was my favorite because of the huge poblano pepper at the bottom.  It was quite flavorful while the others were so so.  If you go for the first time, it is totally worth it to try the 3-taco plate and get 3 different types so you can try as much of the flavors as possible...I highly recommend going this route!

Now as for the service, it wasn't so great.  Our waiter was one of the most crankiest and lack luster servers I have ever had.  We even tried joking with him and striking up conversation, but he wasn't having it.  He was also not so good at showing up to refill our water glasses or ask if we needed anything else.  We noticed he was this way with all the tables in our section in front of the bar.  I can't remember his name because I think I tuned it out out of annoyance.
