The food was prepared very well, great flavor with some bite but not so hot it wasn't enjoyable. The restaurant was an old church at one time so it made for a very unique dining experience. Stained glass church windows and a bar that fit very well with one another was very cool. 

The service on the other hand was just mediocre at best. My biggest complaint was the server kept forgetting or just plain forgot to bring us what was asked for. Although this didn't make for a great overall experience, I would definitely try it again with the hope that the service next time would be much better.
