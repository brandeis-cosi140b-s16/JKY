Over,  just ok.  Even with $25 off $50 restaurant for com gift  certificate.  The chips didn't taste  fresh,  not warm.  Chicken burrito was disappointing,  just chicken lettuce and pico,  menu said chilis, jalepeno sauce... Salad burrito,  asked the waiter if it was the correct burrito and he said yes, we said it is not really spicy it doesn't seem like it was described in the menu, the waiter asked if we wanted to have some Holopainen euros we said sure, then the bill came and had a 2 dollar charge for jalape√±os.  The waiter never said it was a side charge. The specialty tacos were good and the beans were good however the rice left a lot to be desired. Not worth returning in my opinion.
