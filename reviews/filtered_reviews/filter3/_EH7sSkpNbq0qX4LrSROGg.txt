Great food loved the green chili burrito and beans were awesome. Wife had the beef tacos with guacamole which I also tasted and thought it was pretty good.....wife said it was okay? The folks there are very friendly and attentive. My only gripe is the pricing......WOW!!! Tacos were like $2.80 a piece and nothing else, beans and rice are a la carte and not cheap either. The burrito was also about $6 dollars.......as good as it is its still just a burrito. So if you don't mind paying inflated prices for good food this is your place. I will probably return when I get the 2nd mortgage on the house
