Yes, I am somewhat of a mexican-food snob, as many other Yelper's with a Mexican background, and I dislike giving anything less than 3 starts, but have no problem doing so when I absolutely have to. 

Let's start with enjoyable side of my visit at Chayo's. The restaurant is spacious, very nice, clean and a great atmosphere for family/group gatherings.  The waitresses were decent, not overly nice nor rude. The food was decent, but nothing to brag about. ordered a Sangria, and it was VERY good! Very refreshing and decently priced. 

Now, let's get to the problem with this place...My visit with my group of 15+ allowed for plenty of feedback to know well enough it was not just me who felt this way...Ordered the Ceviche appetizer ($14) and was stunned by how small my appetizer was. I'm talking, almost offensive! Noticed that ALL the appetizers were unbelievably small and the entrees were also small, slightly bigger than the appetizers. The Churros ($10) were pretty good, and came with a expresso sized hot chocolate (Abuelita) which was awesome because it's almost unheard of for a Mexican restaurant to serve "chocolate abuelita!" 

These portions were more like Tapas. Don't come here too hungry....
