It's hard to find good food at any airport, but this one is different. The food was great, so 4 stars for that; but we got lousy service, so I have to take away one star. Guacamole was fresh and tasty. Entre was good too. Sangria was a bit too sweet for my taste. I don't know what problem the waitress had with us right from the beginning. She was showing a lot of attitude even as we placed our order. She brought out the guacamole herself, and said the nachos would follow. 5 minutes later we were still waiting for the nachos. The manager was passing by, and he noticed that we were trying to grab her attention; and he helped us himself. This repeated later as well.
