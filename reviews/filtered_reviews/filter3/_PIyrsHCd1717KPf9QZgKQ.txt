I've been here about four times.  I've had the fish tacos more than once, and they are pretty good, though I don't care too much for the cream sauce they douse them with on occasion.  

The slow-roasted pork burrito is delicious.  

Their refried beans and rice are pretty good.  They aren't bland like they are at many other restaurants.  

The guacamole is not very good.  Two of the times I ordered it, it came out in some strange brownish, grayish color.  Expensive, too.  $3-4 for nothing more than three or four tablespoons.

The prices overall are pretty expensive for a Mexican restaurant.  I'm not sure what it is with restaurants like this but MEXICAN FOOD IS NOT MEANT TO BE EXPENSIVE.  It is predominantly made from beans, rice, corn, flour, onions, tomatoes, peppers, and a little bit of meat.  So, why are we paying $13 for an entre?

The atmosphere inside is awesome.  Just what you'd expect from a hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint (which, oddly enough, is in a strip mall).  

BOTTOM LINE:  nice choice for a meal, though I think you can do better for the price (or just as good for cheaper).
