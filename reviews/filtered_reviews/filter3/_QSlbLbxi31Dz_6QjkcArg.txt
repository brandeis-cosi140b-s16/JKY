Went there due to recomendations and was told to try one of the fish dishes ended up deciding on the Mariscos Verrados i think. wasnt really impressed.  I give it to the cook scallops la it was not over cooked the flavors were brought out well just a little better than all the rest except for Bonita Michocan.  Service was great couldnt have had a better waiter  My wife had the rellanos and said mine were better.  My sons had some cheese enchiladas and they were just ok.  Margarita was mixed very well had it on the rocks.  However with the price that it came to be just not quite worth it.  Ive had much better meals at other places for much less.
