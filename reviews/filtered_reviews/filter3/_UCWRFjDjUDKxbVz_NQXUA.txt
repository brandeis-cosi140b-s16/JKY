I went here last week for lunch since a colleague recommended it. I work near Country Club and the north 202 and am getting tired of the same old places within a 1-3 mile radius from work - so I was excited to try something new. 

Typically when I go to Mexican restaurants I order shredded beef hard shell taco's (boring, I know!). They were actually very good, but kind of expensive for their size - I think I paid almost $7 for 2 tacos. The chips and salsa that came with the meal were also pretty good, although I had to salt the chips a lot to get them just right. My colleague got the steak burrito and said he really enjoyed that. Would give it a higher rating if it either the food portions were bigger or the prices were cheaper.
