Mexican + Chinese fusion...but not really in my opinion. The only thing they add that's Mexican are the beans. 

The jade chicken is good, but I was not a fan of the jerk chicken. It's really spicy and the flavor is just ok. You can get a meal with fried rice & beans. I wasn't a fan of the black beans. It was like a paste. 

There is a dining area, but it's pretty ghetto. But I did appreciate the TV that was in the dining area.
