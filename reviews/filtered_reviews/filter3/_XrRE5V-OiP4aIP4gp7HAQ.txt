It was around noon when I visited. Mind you I'm super hung over from Friday night and tacos sounded like the perfect fix. I read all the reviews on here so I wanted to see what all the fuss was about plus k was super super hungry. I think that the tacos were super basic. maybe I feel that way because I'm from LA, and tacos are our thing out there. I had two al pastor and two asasa tacos. The tacos de asada had some guac, I'll pass I didn't like it the tortilla was pretty greasy and the al pastor had a green sauce that wasn't good. Anywho, I guess for twenty bucks it was ok. I'll pass next time though.
