The tacos are amazing but their system for ordering is severely flawed. I stood in line for  45 minutes for tacos. Good tacos! But tacos nonetheless. And you can only order the type of tacos that each particular one is for. So if you want the asada AND the adobada then you'll have to wait in line again to get those.
