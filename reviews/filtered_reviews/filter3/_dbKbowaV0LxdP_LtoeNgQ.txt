Service was great. Drinks were great. Chips and guacamole was great. Smell was awful! It's 108 outside and more people were on the patio than inside, and it's not because of the giant fans or mister system. The inside bar area has an awful sewer smell that anyone can identity as dry p-traps and/or dirty bar. Please, PLEASE, pour some water down the drains!
