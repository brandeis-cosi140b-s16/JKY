The good: Fun and divey atmosphere, Margaritas were tasty. The Baja Chicken Burro was AMAZING and I'm sure horribly bad for you. Portion sizes were good. Chips and salsa were pretty good as well. Our waiter brought us a complimentary shot towards the end of the meal that had tequila in it and was similar to a mini margarita. 

The bad: The service. I asked for a margarita glass with no salt that never came. We were asked if we wanted another pitcher of margaritas and we said maybe in a bit and as we were finishing our meals he just dropped one off at our table which we didn't really want at that point in the meal. They advertise a $2 margarita but it is so small and has so much ice it isn't much bang for your buck. We ended up getting a pitcher and they were tasty but extremely weak. 

I will be back since it is close to the house and the food was good, I just hope that the server pays a bit more attention.
