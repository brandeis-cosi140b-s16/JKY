Once again, we were out and about, my mother-in-law and I, running errands.  Lunch time comes and we are always ready for a bite.  In the mood for Mexican?  Oh yea, I was.  So we headed to Arriba.

The server welcomed us with chips, salsa, and warm bean dip.  It was really good.  Gotta love a Mexican restaurant that serves bean dip on the house.

Thursday is chimi day.  Buck, ninety-nine for a chimichanga.  Such a deal.  I had mine with the green sauce (mild).  The chicken was shredded and very tender.   It was huge, but I ate the whole thing.   Oink.

Great place to grab a quickie meal.
