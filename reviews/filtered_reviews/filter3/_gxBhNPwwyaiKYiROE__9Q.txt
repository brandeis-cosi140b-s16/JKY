I do love Chino, however, I am taking off a couple of stars because the last few times I have gone there, the food didnt seem very fresh but was till tasty. I love the pork fried rice (some of the best fried rice Ive ever had, kinda sweet from the BBQ pork in it), the black beans (some of the best black beans Ive ever had) the jade red chicken and the carnita's quesadilla's. The BBQ Sweet pork is pretty good as well. And the snickerdoodles cookies and chocolate volcano cookies are da bomb. A couple dishes I am not impressed with at Chino: The egg foo young, the chili relleno (had crushed saltines on it which I was not keen on), and the gringo chicken (kinda dry and bland). 
The price is decent although it recently went up. The owners are the nicest people and the staff is always pretty friendly. The decor and ambiance is a little strange with the folding tables, cheap chairs and not much decor on the walls. However, I was told by the owner at one point that they keep it that way so they can keep the food and everything cheaper. They have been improving on this lately with painting the walls and tiling in the crappy little round putting green that was by the backdoor. 
I still like this place very much. Here is a story to tell you how much I like Chino. One time, I got water from the drink dispenser. I was sitting there stirring it around with my straw when I noticed something. Upon further inspection, it was a dead cricket. Pretty dam gross. I was disgusted that I didnt go back to Chino for about a year. Then I started to miss it. So I went back, just dont get a drink anymore. Haha. I do wish that I could go there again and have the food be fresh and wonderful like it once was. Its still good though and I will still go when I get my occasional chino craving. After all, "eat chino, live forever!"
