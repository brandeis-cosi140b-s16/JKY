Our team from work came here before an event for some breakfast and it was alright. I wasn't blown away but I did enjoy it. Their home-made tortillas were delightful but I didn't think my Huevos Rancheros were all that great, otherwise. The sauce on top was somewhat bland and the eggs were overcooked (for being over medium).

I tried my boyfriend's Chile relleno and I didn't like the cheese inside. He said he liked them but he's had better. I just wasn't that impressed by the whole meal. The waitress was awesome so we did appreciate that. Also, the fresh-squeezed lemonade was great. I would definitely get that again. 

In the end though, I probably won't come back to pay $10 for a dish I didn't enjoy.
