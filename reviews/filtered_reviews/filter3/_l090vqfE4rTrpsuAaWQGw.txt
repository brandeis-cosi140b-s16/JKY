We decided to check this place out while in town. The wait time for our order took longer than expected for 2 burritos and a Chorizo plate. I guess that only makes you even hungrier! Once the food arrived, I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't impressed either.  This place is alright. Will give them a try again when I return to Phoenix.
