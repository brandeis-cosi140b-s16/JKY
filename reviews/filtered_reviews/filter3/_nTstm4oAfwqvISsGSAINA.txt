The lack of consistency in the place kills me. I eat here almost every week. Sometime they're like lightning crankin out burritos like crazy. Last couple times I've almost lost my mind. I always happen to be there about an hour before they close. Stop running out of grilled chicken! Make more! I get it, you're gonna close in an hour. I don't care, make more grilled chicken. Don't have the entire staff cleaning up the place instead of helping the 10 people on line. You're going to lose more business with the people you're making unhappy by trying to scrape by the last hour then you will the couple of chicken breasts you might waste. I hate that I keep going there expecting the crap service most of the time. This would be a 1 star if this wasn't the case all the time.
