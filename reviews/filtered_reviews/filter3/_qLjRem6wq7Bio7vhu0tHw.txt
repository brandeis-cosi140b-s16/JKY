During the hectic after Christmastime we decided to finally try much acclaimed mexican dining establishment. Here is our assessment:

VALUE  excellent
FOOD  good
ATMOSPHERE  poor

As the meals we ordered were tasty, the restaurant was freezing (no heat) on a very cold 40 degree evening. Our food became cool and definitly ruined it's flavor. Also neither of us liked the thin tasteless hot sauce...not even as good as Taco Bell!!! Why not offer a variety of salsas.  The place was packed with hungry customers and the food and reasonable prices keep the folks coming in. Personally I think there is room for improvement.
