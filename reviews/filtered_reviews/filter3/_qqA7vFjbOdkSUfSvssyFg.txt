The food here is very good. Although I haven't really tried anything besides the Pollo Fundido (Fried chimichanga filled with shredded chicken and topped off with a jalapeno cream sauce.) Amazing!! My husband had tried a lot of other things in the menu, but always goes back to the Pollo Fundido. 

The service is not the best since they're almost always packed inside. You will probably only see your server an average of three time like mentioned in another review. The space is very limited it used to be a regular home which was converted into a restaurant.  You sit very close to the other table little space to move around. If you can ask to be seated in the first dining room area. The rooms in the back of the restaurant get very hot and uncomfortable.  They also have a bar if you like to eat around loud music.
