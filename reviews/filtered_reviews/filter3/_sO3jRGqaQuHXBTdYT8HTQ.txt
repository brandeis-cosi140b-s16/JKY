Creamy, fresh, deliciously smoky and completely out of this world Elote Callejero appetizer = A+.  I could have eaten five of these.

Super fresh, flavorful and affordable tacos; all varieties = A+.  Also the hot sauces are to die for. 

Disaffected wait staff = C.  Helpful enough I suppose...Smiles and/or welcoming attitudes were completely absent, save for one gentleman running around checking on everyone.

Climate control = C-.  It was hot as Hades in there.  Granted, it IS August, but seriously.  Ouch.

Fly situation = D.  We were swatting them away CONSTANTLY.  Eww.
