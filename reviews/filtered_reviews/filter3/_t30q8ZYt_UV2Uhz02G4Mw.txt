I've been a fan of Wahoo's Tacos for years and especially like the  location in Santa Monica.  I'm very happy they have opened in Summerlin.

The Good:  I had my two favorites, the fish taco and fish enchilada, and both were excellent.  They also have the unique Vegas advantage of having a full bar with video poker machines.  The bar, while small,  was packed at 2pm on a Thursday.

The "Could be Better":  They seem be suffering from opening pains.  The cashier didn't know about the beer of the month so we helped her learn something new.  The food took about 15mins to come where I'm use to about 5 minutes at other Wahoo's.  Also, I missed the condiment bar that most other locations have with a selection of different hot sauces, lime slices, and extra napkins.  If these things improve I will definitely increase my rating.
