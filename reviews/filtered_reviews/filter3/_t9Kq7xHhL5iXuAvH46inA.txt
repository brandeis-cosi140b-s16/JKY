I'm a little conflicted in giving Aunt Chilada's a rating: I've been to the restaurant many times and would possibly say it's my favorite Mexican place to go for dinner (not that I've been to too many Mexican places since I just moved here and my boyfriend is a creature of habit).  The main problem is that the food has been a disappointment more often than not.

Love the hand shaken margarita, which comes with your choice of top shelf tequila and a floater (we usually go with Cointreau).  The flour chips are also really delicious, even if they're not authentic Mexican.  I was iffy on the salsa at first, since it has most of the garden thrown in (olives being the main rogue ingredient), but it's really grown on me over time.

Don't have too many recommendations on entrees.  The fajitas are ok and come with enough to take home for lunch or dinner the next day.  Pretty much everything else I've had has been a failure: greasy, oily quesadillas, dried out machaca and chicken in enchiladas, a chili relleno that was 75% breading.

Thing is, by the time I've enjoyed my margarita and some flour chips out on the awesome patio, I don't need much else to make me happy.  Two stars for an indoor experience, four stars for the patio.  Average it out for three overall.
