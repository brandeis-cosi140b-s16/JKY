Underwhelming.  The tacos seem exciting on the menu, but the flavor is bland and missing a bold punch (the tortillas in particular tasted like store-bought Mission tortillas).  Nothing special about the food and likely wouldn't come back as the Taco Guild is an overpriced, blase restaurant with too many other flavorful Mexican food options in the area.  However, they deserve credit (hence the 3 stars instead of 2) for their interesting decor and effort repurposing an old church.
