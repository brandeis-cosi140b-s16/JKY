After seeing this place on Food Network I called my Bro. who lives in Chandler and asked him if he has been here, and of course his answer was yes, so I told him next time I'm in town I want to hit up this place so it was a done deal, the food was just okay I liked what I ordered but it wasn't really a wow factor for me, my Mom on the other hand didn't care for the food at all so she wont be returning. It's cool that you get to sample the food before you order it that way you know whats good and what's not...
