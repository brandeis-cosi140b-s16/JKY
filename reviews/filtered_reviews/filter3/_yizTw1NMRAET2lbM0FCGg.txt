Nothing special.  That's about it.  I had a craving for some nachos - average.  My husband had the enchladas - again, average.  I tried a pina colada - super average.  The service - not so great.  We went for lunch.  It wasn't crowded.  In fact, I didn't see many people.  And yet it was hard to get the waitress to the table.
