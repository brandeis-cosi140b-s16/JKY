To whom it may concern,

I am in search of delicious Mexican food that is full of flavor and a little heat. I came to Haciendas hoping to find this (and it is close to us) but was left with want, once again. The street tacos were dry, burrito was filled to the brim with chicken but it had no flavor, and the salsa was tasteless as well. Don't get me wrong, this place is not bad - it just is ok. The service was great and the staff was friendly which is enough for me to give it a second chance - in time. For now I will sit and dream about the glorious Mexican food we left behind in New Mexico

Yours truly,
Desperately seeking good food
