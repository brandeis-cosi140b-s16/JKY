This was my first visit to Agave.  I agree with several of the posters who rate this as average food and over-priced.  I do like the building, both inside and out.  We did have good service.  We also were there in the late afternoon when there were few other people there.

I had the Steak "Alambre" style.  It was a tasty dish that could have used some more heat.  My wife had the Mayan Chicken Tamales.  She liked them but thought they were spicy hot (they weren't) and she thought there was no chicken filing until deep down (there was but it was bland and you couldn't distinguish it from the masa).

When I checked my email later, I received one from Open Table saying that Agave had cancelled my reservation.  I don't know why, but that means no open table points.

I'm not anxious to return to Agave when there are so many other good Tex/Mex places around this town.
