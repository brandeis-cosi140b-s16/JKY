As a Pitt alum, I've spent my fair share of time here.

In summary: decent food, strong semi-good drinks, very average service, and too small of a space.

I generally avoid going there unless if it's summer or winter break. The food and drinks are OK, but not nearly good enough to have to deal with Oakland parking/traffic/etc and waiting 45+ minutes to get a table.
