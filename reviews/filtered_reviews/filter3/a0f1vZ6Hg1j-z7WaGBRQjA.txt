So I wrote a bad review last week about the Sandbar. Not to take away from the experience of mine which was not good; after the words of a friend I decided to do a re-write: which I have never done. 

I have to say I have been there several times before and have not had a bad experience. Additionally, those I had lunch with that day had no complaints whatsoever and stated the server they have had previously and always has been good. 

Also, the AGM did actually contact me and apologized for the experience and offered to buy me lunch. 

So a week later, here is my objective non-hungry or quick tempered review. 

The food I did have was good. John enjoyed his chicken burrito and Jen along with other coworkers all were very satisfied.  Thursdays  ladies get half prices apps and drinks which is pretty much the draw every week. 

The whole experience wasn't perfect but one mistake does not dictate disaster. Like I said I have been here for other occasions and at other times of day and have found it to be a very fun and relaxing place. 

I won't promise all my future reviews to be full of hugs and kisses but they will be more well tempered.
