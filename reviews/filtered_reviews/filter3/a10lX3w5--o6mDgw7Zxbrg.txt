I REALLY want to love this place.  Its in my neighborhood, it has a good atmosphere.  Its a fun place to take visitors or to meet up with friends.  Margaritas are just OK and the food reads well on the menu, but for me, its just not that exciting to eat.  Salsa is good, service is good, but considering it all, the food just really knocks it down a few stars.  Tip:  if you are a brunch lover, there are so many delicious places in Madison, I would not waste your Sat/Sun here
