3.5 Star
After trying a michelada from Captain Tom's in Houston, TX, I was hoping to find a michelada that is as good here.  Last night, I told my husband that I wanted one.  He  suggested Viva.  

They offered two types of michelada, with lime or preparada (with clamato juice).  I ordered the preparada but my husband override my decision and asked for two with lime with dos equis.  Our drinks came out and I was disappointed.  Not the delicious michelada that I was hoping for.  We asked for more lime wedges and it definitely made it taste better, but still, not the spicy tomatoey, limey michelada that I craved for.

For dinner, I ordered menudo (only offered on Sat and Sun), and my husband ordered lengua plate.  They gave us a  bowl of soup to start our meal, and it was pretty good.  I only ate 1/3 of my soup and took the rest to go.  There was an abundant of tripe in the bowl.  My husband's lengua was very tender.  One of our favorite item of this restaurant are is the tortilla.  Oh, forgot to mention that they also give you chips, salsa, and bean dip to snack on.

The staff is very friendly, funny, and attentive.

Overall, I really want to be a fan of Viva because of the awesome staff. However, I have to give it 3.5 star for now.
