This place is really good.  The food is excellent, the service is outstanding.  What I DIDN'T like here was that the menu does not have the prices of their drinks.  So after searching for it, I had to ask the waitress who came back and told me what a margarita cost.  They are good but very expensive and I think it is wrong to expect people to just order drinks with dinner, wine, beer or whatever and not know how much they cost from looking at the menu.  Seems a bit devious to me.  So I only rate them a three stars.
