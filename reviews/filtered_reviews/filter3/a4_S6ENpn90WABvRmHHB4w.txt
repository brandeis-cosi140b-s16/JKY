Staying at the Luxor because I missed my flight and my boyfriend had switched from the MGM Signature to the Luxor since I wasn't here. Well now I was, urgh, what a day. So, we cruised around for something to eat. Mexican is usually pretty easy to do vegetarian so we got a table. Alicia was our server and she was great. 

I ordered a cheese quesadilla and it came with chicken, geez, seriously, this was twice in one day I got meat served to me. Anyway, they sorted it out and all was fine. The drinks were good and the chips, salsa and quacamole were yummy.
