Tried this place shortly after it opened. It's in a fun location and atmosphere. We had a great server and the food really was quite good. Serving tacos on the little holders is a great idea, keeps the mess down.

Nothing exactly bad to say, just a bit steep on the pricing for what you get. It's a good place to check out, but nothing really 'popped' for me--the "modern Mexican cantina' theme is nice, but not fresh.
