Great price, fast service, chips and salsa are awesome. 

FOOD
You can eat as little as you want or as much as you want and still not break the bank. If you're not really hungry you can get something simple like soup or plain tortillas wth beans. If you're starving order a Mexi-pizza.

Each stereotypical mexican entree comes heaping with beans, rice and lettuce- so you will have a plateful of food. 

SERVICE
Chips, drinks, and salsa arrive at the table almost before you do. Drinks are always promptly refilled. They never complain if they have to split a check. 

OTHER
The only reason they don't get 4 stars is because they aren't high quality Mexican food- more like a step up from fast food. The tables and chairs are also very tightly packed into the establishment.
