Living across the street from City North I've been anxiously waiting for MM to open.  We went a few nights ago for dinner and I have to say it didn't live up to our expectations.  The patio and atmosphere is beautiful.. give that 5 stars!  But the food and overall experience was just ok.  We asked to mix our tacos since they give you 3, can we have 2 steak and 1 pork but they said it's not allowed. Funny since we offered to pay the higher price and just sub 1 of them for pork, but i guess they couldn't do it.  Seems like it would be pretty easy to do and other restaurants usually have no problem with that.  Anyways, the carne asada tacos were good but a little light on the meat.  Salsa was ok but was lacking spice.  We also ordered the guacamole which we did enjoy.  The salsa flight was nice to be able to sample everything but again they were all mild and lacked alot of flavor.  My friend ordered the chicken tacos and only ate 2 as she didn't care for the flavor. 

We were hoping for dessert but they said they don't have a dessert menu.  Hopefully this is something that is coming soon.  

Service was ok but I know it's new so we figure they are still getting used to running the place.  They looked short staffed so our waitress wasn't on top of things like we would expect.  She also asked if we wanted our bill when we still had full drinks at the table.  Felt a little rushed like she was trying to clear us out.  

We will give this place another shot and try another item off the menu since the tacos weren't the best.  But i'm really hoping it gets better as it's a beautiful place and perfect location for us to walk over for lunch or dinner.
