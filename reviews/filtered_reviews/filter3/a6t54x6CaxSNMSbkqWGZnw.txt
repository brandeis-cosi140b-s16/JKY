This is was my 2nd time at Blanco's. 

Here is the run down:

Get the guacamole! It tingles the tastebuds. 

Salsa is also quite delicious. Not too hot and goes great with the freshly made chips. 

Fajitas-got chicken and shrimp but ordered steak and shrimp.

The reason I didn't correct my order: service was about a 1.1. It took forever for everything. Don't quite know what the hold up was (both bartenders were busy taking order and 3rd emp just stood behind the bar). 

With this being said the food was a 4-4.5 but the service was a buzz kill. 

Will I be back, yea. Will I sit anywhere close to the bar, no.
