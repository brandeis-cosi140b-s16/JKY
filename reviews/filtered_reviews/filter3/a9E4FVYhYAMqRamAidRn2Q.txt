Great patio at night during the cooler months.

 We recently enjoyed the nice weather with a southwestern feast here. The menu was definitely Mexican, but a little off-beat too. This is a great place to go with a group of friends to get the "old town" party started.

Overall good food, nice atmosphere, fair prices, and an amazing location.
