Finding a place with a large patio on a hot summer day can not be considered a great find.

We arrived and parking was so tight we had to park on a near by neighbor hood street.

Inside it was crowded with a long line to order.

Most items are available in regular and XL size. I went with a regular vegetarian quesadilla $3.75 and "Americas corn" 2.50, and was then given a number for my table.

My quesadilla arrived and it was much smaller than I expected and less cheesy, but the saut√©ed onions were good. The Corn is just a corn on the cob, covered in mayo and then some shredded cheese. Each dish comes with a small piece of cucumber and radish. 

On the table there is a large selection of hot sauces however they did not taste fresh to me.

My co workers got the carne asada and they liked it.

They have a 2-6 happy hr with $1 tacos cheap chips and beer I may try it again for a late lunch.
