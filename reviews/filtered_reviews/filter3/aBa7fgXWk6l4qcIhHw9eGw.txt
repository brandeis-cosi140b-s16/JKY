Food was ok. Got chicken, barbacoa, and carnitas tacos. Wife got nachos. Food was a 6/10.  Tacos are miniature and I can get the same off the taco truck. 
For someone that's never been there it's totally confusing. The trays are at the end of the line at the register and the start of the line is labeled as station 4 instead of 1. Then the signage isn't good enough for the new customer to figure out how the whole thing works. Once you know how it works it's easy. There's not really a line, it's more a free for all to get your food and then get to the register and wait. 
Like most other people said, the register area is totally inefficient and slow. 
Super grossed out by the salsa bar. The ladle is WAY too big for the mini cups they provide, so you end up pouring it all over your fingers and then it drips back into the salsa. Saw this happen with almost every person before me. Passed on the salsa after I saw this.
