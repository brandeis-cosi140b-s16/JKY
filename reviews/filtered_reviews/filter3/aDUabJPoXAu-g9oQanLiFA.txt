A Tex-Mex place that combines the lack of authenticity from fast-casual dining like Chipotle with the selection and taste from fast food like Filiberto's.

And adds cheap drafts on game day. No, like REALLY cheap drafts. Could not believe I was paying $2 a pint for a good IPA. The food ain't the most quality stuff, but it tastes nice, has a fun environment, and cool staff. Really not a bad place to pregame it.
