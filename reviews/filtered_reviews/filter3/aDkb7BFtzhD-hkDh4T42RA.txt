I'm so torn on this review. Having grown up in New Mexico, I am a huge fan of New Mexican food and research suggests that chile may be addictive so I'm generally grateful to find a place to get my fix in the Valley. 

I had the huevos rancheros, which is two eggs any style over corn tortillas and smothered in red and/or green chile (in New Mexico, we do both and call it "Christmas." i.e. Question: "Red or Green?" Answer: "Christmas"). It was served with a side of refried beans and rice. (I liked the rice.) 

Si Senor uses the New Mexican red and green chiles but it didn't really scratch the itch, if you know what I mean. (The bean dip was spicier than the "hot" green chile. The bean dip was really good, by the way!) 

I just really don't have anything compelling to say about this place. Bottom line, after a 20 mile drive to check them out, I just don't think their chile delivered. 

The chips and salsa plate they start you with was nice. It included a fiery bean dip, green chile, salsa, and a sour cream. And, the fact that you get sopapillas at the end of your meal is a nice memory of my days in NM (but I don't remember ever having the option of a cinnamon and sugar one?!) although the texture of the sopapillas was off. 

I drove a long way to check out Si Senor and, truthfully, I would rather drive back to Albuquerque for some Carne Adovada (not even on Si Senor's menu) than back to Chandler; however, if I was IN Chandler already I would probably give them another visit - you know, research suggests chile is addictive...! I mean, I'm already wondering how I would have felt if I had gotten the stuffed sopapilla...
