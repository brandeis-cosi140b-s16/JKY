Over the lips, past the gums, look out stomach here it comes!!!! For a fast food Mexican Food joint, I have to say this one is pretty tasty! I LOVE their Super Nachos! They also have decent tacos and yummy rice and beans. If you don't catch them when they are busy) you don't always get the freshest ingredients, as in sometimes I have had stale chips, or the meat wasn't as good as it usually is...... so try hitting this place during the normal B,L and D time rush. Also if you're looking for a late night snack, this place is open 24/7 so being able to stuff your face with pretty decent Mexican Food, is better than no food at all :) I have to say I will keep visiting Fiesta Burrito rather than their competition! They are better than FillyB's and close to my bf house! Alway a plus when we feel like grabbing something quick! I just wish they would stop being delicious sometimes and meh the next! Consistency is nice!
