China Poblano is a bright, fun, casual restaurant. Seriously, it is a carpeted wall away from being an ecstasy-lover's dream. Chinese and Mexican small plates is the name of the game here. They have a healthy list of tacos. Being a self-appointed taco aficionado, this was a welcomed sight. Unfortunately, the two I tried (Viva Chine & Carnitas) missed a mark a bit, but were still solid. However, when you are dropping five bucks on a taco, you are looking for a bulls-eye. The tuna ceviche, on the other hand, was dynamite. I am not a huge ceviche fan, but the server recommended it, so we gave it a whirl. Marcus was dead-on with this suggestion. We also tried the 20 vegatable fried rice, which was alright. Overall, the dishes were interesting and varied in tastiness. The food was quality and intriguing enough to warrant another visit sometime in the future.
