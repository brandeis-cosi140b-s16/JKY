My roommate frequents this spot often so I was curious. When we got there around 8pm we were told the wait was 15-20 min which it was but did notice lots of empty tables. Seemed fine because service was speedy once sat. 

let's start w/the positives;
Ron y piña as a cocktail....so tasty fresh pineapple, rum, lime and chili y salted rim which I love and you can also taste a light pineapple pulp.

For dinner I ordered the rice which was super interesting & had bits of veggies like mushrooms mmmmm. I bet it's their paella rice, it's a lil crispy and chewy and has some nice flavoring. I really could jus come and eat a million bowls of rice. 

taco chinos are pretty bomb, so hearty and unique. They have this Vietnamese style thing going on. I know this is jus wrong to say but I would use less meat and add maybe carrots or a little bean sprt to give it an ump. But really that is minor. 

my hang ups;
I tried to order pork belly tacos but they were out and no chips and salsa which for me is blasphemy.

cochitia taco. was totally thrown off by the flour taco and I feel some sort of way for paying $4 for 1 taco, it was good but not impactful.

overall I wanted to love this place but I luv the taco truck la frontera more#€#%#^*+==
