I went here to kick off the big Vegas weekend, thinking it would be fun & convenient.  Turned out to be dead on a Friday!!  The guac was good, but the portion was wrong skimpy.  The margs were okay, but it was irritating when the server tried to 'up-sell' our pitcher with Grand Marnier.  I split the pork tasting with anther pork lover and neither of us found it impressive.  Small, fatty portion.  

3rd star because I was with my best friends, so the experience was fun nonetheless.
