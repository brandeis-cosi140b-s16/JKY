This is a fusion I never expected - Mexican and Chinese, street food-style.

Two separate bars surround different cooking apparatus - steam baskets filled with dim sum on one side, and grills for tacos on the other.

The guacamole ($15) is fresh.  "When Pigs Fly" ($13+ for four) was nice but nothing spectacular.  The carnitas taco ($5+ for one) had an interesting twist with pork rinds on top.  Everything was good but not great.  The major downside is that it's just too pricey for the quick bites. 

Interesting but limited drinks.

Fun to try once, but probably nothing I'd need to go back for.
