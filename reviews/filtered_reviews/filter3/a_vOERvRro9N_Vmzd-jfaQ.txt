Let me start off by saying that I would like to go back to El Segundo to experience the bar because this place has got a KILLER atmosphere. The restaurant sits open to LV Blvd and has got a great patio with a balcony of lit trees. I loved, loved, loved the design of this place.

The chips and salsa ($2.95 for bottomless!) were DELISH.

My meal, although I just got a cheese crisp, was just OK. I had looked at getting the Fajitas but they were a bit on the pricey side ($18). 

They had an extensive bar menu though and you can't really go wrong with a margarita so I would recommend this place for a drink and a snack but not sure you could count on a mind-blowing meal from El Segundo.
