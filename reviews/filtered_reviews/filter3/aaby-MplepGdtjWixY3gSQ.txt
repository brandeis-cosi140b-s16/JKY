Just ate Miguel's for lunch today and got my fill of fast food Mexican for a decent price.  I'm not overly impressed by the place, but it makes for a nice meal if you're in the Paw Creek area (85 and Little Rock Rd.).  There's an open "veranda" for dining (read: a dining room with out doors or windows attached on the front) that was a nice touch on a day like today.  Fast, cheap, and loaded with salt, what else could you ask from a local Mexican joint?

They have all the regular dishes you would find on a menu in a down-home Mexican place, plus lunches specials for about $5-$6.  I got the Speedy Gonzales, an enchilada, taco, and rice for a respectable $5.75.  The service was rather impersonal and task-focused, but maybe it was just one of those days.   I agree with Tonya that the sketch factor of  restaurants like these "raise the stakes": you'll either discover a hidden treasure or the Bates motel.  Miguel's, however, wasn't either one.  So maybe the "ho-hum"-ness of this place was my false expectations.  No hidden treasures here, just decent Mexican food.
