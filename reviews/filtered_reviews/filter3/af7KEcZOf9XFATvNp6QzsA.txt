The guacamole was pretty good here, they made it at the table right in front of me!!! I enjoyed that, the cheapest show I ever saw in Vegas.  The decor was a bit over the top- way to red for me.  I expect to be comforted by Mexican food- For the food to take away my stress and anxiety, and give me a deep sense of inner peace.  Maybe I expect too much from my burrito- but who can say? ;-)
Anyway Diego was pricey for the food, but overall I would go back, but not that often.
