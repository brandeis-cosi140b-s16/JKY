China Poblano has an interesting concept but I'm not sure if I want to eat chinese and mexican food at the same time.  The decor is interesting, we sat outside where you can see everyone else.

Food:

Twenty Vegetable Fried Rice: this was probably the best thing on the menu.  We added chicken to the dish 

Happy Family Jiaozi: these dumplings were itty bitty and not that great.  The sauce that it accompanied was too sweet.

Guacamole: this was good, I would recommend sharing with the table

Hot and Sour Soup: A little too vinegar-y and too much fungus

Tacos: these were good but a little on the greasy side.  I would recommend eating somewhere else if you're craving Mexican or Chinese food.
