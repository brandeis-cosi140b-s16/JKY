The food here is very good and is reminiscent of that in older South Eastern areas of Arizona. I grew up in Globe and love the food here as it reminds me of my youth and my hometown. With that said, I think this place has some issues. The service here can be quite spotty. For instance...we went in this evening for a Friday night dinner. We arrived at 6:30 pm and were told there would be a 15 minute wait. While waiting I decided to use the restroom and proceeded into the restaurant and to my surprise, more than half of the place was empty.... When I asked the hostess why there was a 15 minute wait on a Friday night with half the place full she told me that they only had 3 waitstaff on this evening. I know I counted at least 5 that were milling about casually. At any rate, if you aren't in a big hurry I would recommend anything with the enchilada sauce on it (best I've had) and the tacos are great.
