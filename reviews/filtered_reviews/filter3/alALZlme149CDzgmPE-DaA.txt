Last meal before leaving Vegas...

Self-seating. Takes awhile for the server to come greet, but I don't blame them with how disorganized this place is. However, our server was extremely friendly :)

Ordered: 
Chicken Fajita Burrito (minus the chicken and cheese) - was decent. Definitely not an authentic Mexican burrito... but it did it's job and made me full as can be.

$11 beers... what the redonkulous? Only in Vegas...
