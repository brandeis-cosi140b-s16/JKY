* Welcome Experience
- Ordinary

Nothing to report here...

* Establishment
- Encouraging

Interesting decor, especially if you are in to Sammy Hagar and all the trappings.  Big, loud, Vegas.  

* Service
- Outstanding 

Alexis was really good!  She was personable and attentive and showed up at all the right times.  Someone who came to clear the table accidentally knocked a glass of ice water in one of my party's plate.  He promptly apologized and sent a manager.  Without question the manager removed the entree from the bill and offered an alternative.  (To go even!)  The leadership definitely emphasizes service.  Bravo!

* Food Quantity / Quality / Presentation
- Discouraging

Keep your expectations LOW - it's CABO WABO.  I mean, any place that has MEXIYAKI on the menu had to be appetizer and beer fare.  It was.  

The $32 New York strip I ordered was smothered in dark sauce to hide the poor quality, and was way past med rare, and tough as can be.  

It was good party food, not a dining experience - (keep your expectations low!)

* What I'll remember

Alexis genuinely cared!

What I can't wait to forget

The gristle I had to cut out from my $32 New York strip.
