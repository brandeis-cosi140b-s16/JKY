So, the good:  Plaintain and black bean mash, lump crab nachos, skinny margarita, chipolte ribs

The bad:  Service is hit or miss, enchiladas are meh, greens are very plain.

Note: The grilled corn used to be fabulous when served on the cob.  Too many people complete complained about it being messy so they now strip it from the cob.  It has lost something.  Let's worry less about being "clean" and more about good food!
