I would do 3.5 if that was an option, though. 

This place gets a bump b/c of outdoor seating which allows for excellent people watching. The food is very good, although not particularly special. Same for the drinks. Maybe it's because I've never been for happy hour, to experience the specials, but for the prices I wanted more... more flavor, bigger margarita, chips and salsas on the table... 

We ordered the queso fundito, which is my less preferred option to queso dip, but it was tasty with nice hints of roasted peppers in it. Then I had the shrimp fajitas, and my friend has the steak/chicken fajitas combo. Service was good, but not standout.

I loved Cafe Ba Ba Reeba that lived here before, and I don't think El Segundo Sol has quite filled those shoes.
