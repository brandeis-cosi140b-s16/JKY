Getting your tires rotated should not take very long right?? Wrong, we had just dropped off the car to have the tires rotated down the street and the guy said okay thank you we will see you in an hour and half. So we decided we would go grab a bite to eat. Why not try Viva Mercados. 

For the time being around 5:30 I expected to wait but that was not the case, we were seated immediately and the server was on top of the bean dip, salsa, and chips. We were a very easy table for the drinks, 3 Waters with lemon and and kids apple juice. While looking over the menu I was a little taken back by the $8 Kids meal price and the high prices on the food, I may sound like a cheap skate here but I'm sorry I did not feel like we were walking into a upper scale Mexican restaurant. My chimichanga was good and i did have leftovers but the entire time I was thinking about the fact that I very easily could have received the same exact item at a hand full of other places for almost half of the price. 

Enough about the prices.... The chimichanga I mentioned above was the shredded beef chimichanga that comes enchilada style with sour cream and guacamole, beans and rice and your sopa ahead. The meat was very tender and flavorful and the beans were pretty good, my only complaint was the rice, it was very dry. As far as i could tell the drinks must have been strong since the ladies in the booth across from us seemed pretty tottered... Overall the food is good and the service was great but I personally feel the prices are a little steep.. But we will probably be back in the future!!!
