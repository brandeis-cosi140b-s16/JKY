The food is not bad, it wasn't the greatest.. I went to a different location years ago and thought it was really good, so came to this one and the food is not the greatest, but not bad either.  

The place was pretty clean so that was a bonus.  I just didn't like the attitude of the girl who took the order... but what can you expect from teenagers, really?

Probably won't be back in anytime soon but will always give something a second chance.
