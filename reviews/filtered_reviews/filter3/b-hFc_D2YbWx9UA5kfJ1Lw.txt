The food is OK. The place was a little noisy. If you are in the Luxor and have a craving for some Tex Mex, this would be a decent choice. However, this is not my favorite place for Tex Mex in Vegas. For that, I would suggest you check out Dos Caminos at The Venetian or The Pink Taco at The Hard Rock.
