If this is the best Mexican food in Vegas, then I have to believe that there's not much competition!  Not that Isla is a bad restaurant, but I'd have to agree with another reviewer; it's basically a step above Chevy's.  I ate here twice during a recent stay in Vegas.  The first time, I was by myself and I had an appetizer and a drink, which was fantastic.  I tried the ceviche, and it was middle of the road, although the mojito was good.  The second night we stopped here for a late dinner, and honestly, I found the food to be overly rich and greasy and not very tasty.  I prefer sitting in the bar outside the casino and getting appetizers and drinks, otherwise I wouldn't waste my time!
