Carnitas taco, barbacoa taco, beef siu mai, Chinese wings, Mongolian beef

Definitely a neat concept. The space is really cool, you can see them making the tacos and noodles from the outside.

We made a reservation which was the right call since the place was pretty full. The waiter recommended ordering a few dishes to share, so that's the route we went. We ordered, tacos, siu mai, wings, mongolian beef, and the queso fundido (basically make your own quesadilla). The food comes out as its ready, so it's kind of fun waiting to see what comes next.

The item was the tacos and I have to say the barbacoa taco is easily in my Top 3 Tacos of All Time. Absolutely amazing. I regret not ordering more them. We also got the carnitas which was good but can't be compared to the barbacoa.

After that came the beef siu mai which I thought tasted a little off. The rest of my party did not finish it either. Luckily the asian wings and mongolian beef arrived quickly after that. I really liked the wings, but the mongolian beef could have been from any corner Chinese shop.

And that was it. Oh wait, what about the queso fundido. It still hadn't come 20 minutes after the previous dish. We asked our waiter about it and it had either never been reported to the kitchen or they lost the ticket. Either way it came out right away after we asked, but they were not apologetic at all. The queso itself was alright, although definitely not worth the wait.

Overall I'd say the food is most just good, but you can do so much better (with much better service) at too many places on the strip to make this a must-visit.
