I am going to return to Taco Guild and hope for a better experience than the first. I went shortly after they opened and it seemed they still had a few kinks to work out, but I know that is normal for any new spot so I will go easy with the criticism. It took up space in the old Methodist Church and maintained the beauty of the structure by repurposing the gorgeous old building instead of rebuilding it. The stain glass windows, giant chandeliers and alter bar truly are magnificent. 

The tacos were gourmet street tacos and they were not bad, but for their price point I expected a little more. (Gallo Blanco knows what I'm saying, they've got it down). The chips were delicious but I have to admit the salsa reminded me that this is the child of Z'tejas. I like that they serve all local crafted beers, but I was disappointed there was not one Mexican beer on tap. Who wants to wash down a shot of tequila with an IPA?

The place is family style which I don't mind, but the table they sat us at was so cramped I barely had room to move. Also the brick walls and high ceilings really carry voices, and I had to shout through my meal to hear my bf (not the best thing when you are sitting next to 4 strangers).

The service was horrible, but I won't harp on that because they had just opened. 

The valet service was atrocious, this has no impact on my review but hopefully they can get the feedback somehow.
We went to get the car and it was raining, the valet wouldn't leave his post because he was waiting for another guy to come back, he wouldn't give us the keys because the car was parked across Osborn.
We stood there for over 10 minutes in the rain. They weren't that busy, there was no rhyme or reason for this. 

I will return and hope for a better experience (and maybe skip the valet), it really is a cool spot, and it just needs to work a few things out.
