The food here is usually good - the thai burrito is unique and tasty and the fried tofu is delicious even for a non-tofu eater. The margaritas are fantastic, especially when they're discounted for happy hour and late night. I like the seasonal variations as well as the usual flavors. A few margs and a pickadippa is always a good decision.

The service at this location, however, is bad. The restaurant is small and as a result the servers rush you in and out. I have been here at least two dozen times, and almost every time the servers have been at best inattentive and at worst blatantly rude if we stay at the table longer than 2 minutes after the entree is done. This doesn't just happen when the restaurant is busy - we were there a few days ago in an almost empty restaurant on a Thursday night and two waitresses stood four feet away from us and glared for 30 minutes. Everyone at my table commented on how uncomfortable it was. 

I really do like Mad Mex at this location and I'm going to keep going because I love the margaritas - but the service needs to improve.
