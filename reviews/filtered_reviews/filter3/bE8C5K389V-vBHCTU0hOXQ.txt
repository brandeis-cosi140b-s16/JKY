Tina was an excellent server and replenished our beverages before our drinks were even half empty.

The fajitas were very tasty but didn't have enough meat (combination of steak and shrimp). 

The ground beef Mexican pizza had a lot of ground beef that was cooked perfectly and a variety of cheeses as well as green and red peppers and onions.

The chips and salsa were worth the price of admission.

I've had the opportunity to eat here twice now (I live out of town) and can't wait to get back.
