It's noon, so lunch rush... I get it. I ordered "combo 2" (2 tacos, fries and a soft drink). I was quoted 10 min but actual service time was 15 min. If you ask me, that's a bit long for fried fish and shrimp on plain tortillas where you take them to the salad bar and build them yourself. The cilantro mayo is a winner though! Yummm
