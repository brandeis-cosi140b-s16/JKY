The Good:
Modern, hip decor.
Great patio seating with misters.
Friendly, attentive staff kept the drinks, water, chips & salsa coming.
Tasty chips & salsa.

The Not So Good:
Food came to the table cold.
Hate to say this, but it was bland.
Drinks were small and lacked any kind of kick.

Verdict: Won't be going back.
