I tried El Segundo Sol after a shopping trip at Fashion Show Mall.  My partner and I wanted to refuel and relax before heading out to gamble on the strip, and the cute outdoor patio seemed like the right spot to chill. Loved the music they play (lots of reggaeton and salsa), as well as the twinkling lights.

When we arrived, the front patio area was pretty full, but the back part was empty. Our server was courteous, and took our drink orders fairly promptly. We also ordered the bottomless chips and salsa.  A few minutes later, our server came back to let us know the wine I'd ordered was only available by the bottle, not by the glass. (I thought that was odd, since it was clearly on the menu as one of the wines available by the glass. Maybe update your menus to avoid confusion...). But cool, ordered a different wine. 

We waited at least 15 minutes for our chips and salsa appetizer. It arrived right before the entrees.  That was irritating, as we were hungry, and what's the point of bottomless chips (not free btw) if they give them to you right before your meal?  The chips and salsa were actually quite tasty. 

The Mexican chopped salad I ordered was not great. It was basically a cold garden salad with a few pieces of corn and beans and dry chicken. My partner's tacos weren't bad, a little salty, but decent overall. 

I ordered a second glass of wine that never arrived, so I eventually canceled it before getting the check. Overall, the service was ill timed and distracted, though our server was very polite.  

Would I return? Yes, but probably for happy hour or to grab light appetizers and a drink on the patio.  For a full meal, probably not.
