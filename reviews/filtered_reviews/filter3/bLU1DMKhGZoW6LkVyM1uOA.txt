I'm late with this review, so can't remember all the details. Despite the name, don't come here looking for authentic Mexican food. It's a trendy restaurant that uses mostly tacos as the medium. Nice large space, well decorated, homey feeling. I had 3 tacos and my wife had two. Sorry, we can't remember the filings, but mine would have been fish or veggies. Just not memorable, and at $55 total, is a bit pricey when we only had one or two drinks.
