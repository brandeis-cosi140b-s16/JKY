Probably 2.5 stars.  The staff was nice but it's the food that holds this place back from  a higher rating.  The chips and salsa are bland.  Went with the chicken, shrimp and steak fajitas.  The steak was clearly a low quality and tasted like liver, everything else just felt massed produced.  Next will be going elsewhere.
