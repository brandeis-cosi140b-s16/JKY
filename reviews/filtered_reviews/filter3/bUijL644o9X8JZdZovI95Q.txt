The Cadillac Margarita was amazing but too strong for my personal taste. The Strawberry Margarita was delicious; definitely recommended for those of us who do not like the strong taste of liquor. Lol. As for the food, I wasn't very impressed; too expensive for what you get. The meats [steak, chicken & lobster] were all overcooked. The highlight of the meal was the salsa served with chips & the hand-made tortillas. I would be inclined to visit again if their prices were a little lower.
