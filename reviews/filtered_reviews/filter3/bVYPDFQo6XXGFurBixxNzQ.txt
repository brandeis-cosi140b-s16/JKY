Went to Cabo Wabo with the family in August 2015, and found it was nothing like the Cabo Wabo in Mexico.

This Cabo Wabo is located on the corner of the Planet Hollywood Resort, on the Strip.

The good part of our visit was the margaritas.  We decided it was a better value to get the pitcher.  The margaritas where delicious, and had a good about of tequila in them.  If you decide to visit the restaurant, I would only come for the margaritas.  The server was also very friendly and attentive.

The food items were very expensive, and the portion size was very small.  I have seen more rice and beans on children's plates at other restaurants.  On the plus side the small portions you do get taste good and are freshly made.

Some of the negatives:

I have never been to a Mexican restaurant where they didn't toss a basket of chips and salsa on your table when you sat down.  Here it's a $6 charge if you want chips and salsa.

Most of the items do not come with beans and rice, that will cost you and additional $7 on top of the cost of the entree dish.

Check your bill before paying.  I noticed a $8 "CNF" charge on my bill.  When I asked what that was I was told it was a concession fee because the Planet Hollywood charges them for being on the property.  Basically, Cabo Wabo wants to charge me outrages food prices and then on top of that help pay their rent.  I informed the server I wanted to speak to the manager because I was not going to pay this additional fee.  She returned with different bill with the CNF fee removed.  I can't imagine how many people pay that fee without asking a question as to why. 

Although the margaritas were delicious, and the food good, albeit small in portion, I would not come back here because of the very expensive prices and because of them trying to add on additional charges to my tab without informing me.
