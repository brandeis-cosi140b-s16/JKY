Nice people helpful. But the food I ordered was very very bad!!! I ordered some asada tacos, I didn't even eat them. they were full of oil and it didn't taste nor it looked like carne asada. Very disappointing. I have to say their free margarita was very good and their chips with salsa and bean deep was good. But I wouldn't go there just for margaritas and chips with salsa and beans
