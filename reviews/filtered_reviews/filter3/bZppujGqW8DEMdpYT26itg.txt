Great happy hour with cheap margs is the best thing Blue Agave has to offer. Atmopshere is lacking. Not fun or authentic. Maybe after a couple of margs, it appears to be decent but really not a hot spot that makes me want to go back. There are other local places for HH nearby so I wouldn't go out of the way to come here. Foodwise I wouldn't really bother.
