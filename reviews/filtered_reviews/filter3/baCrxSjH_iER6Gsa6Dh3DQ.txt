I like coming here during happy hour. You can get really cheap chimis and taquitos. I think they're like 6-7 dollars per dozen. The menu is 1/2 off appetizers. Two dollar dos equis during the same time. The chimis and taquitos are plenty filling and the beer is cheap. Can't beat that.

Only thing is that happy hour is very limited in the time window so make sure you get off work early or maybe head somewhere else. Service always seems like they'd rather be doing something else or they really just aren't all there. More than that, they don't like to try to beat the happy hour times.
