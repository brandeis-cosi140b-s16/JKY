We had a work dinner here.

The evening started off a bit rocky as they didn't have our reservation.  Some mix up, but they were able to accommodate us.  They wanted to make us order off some special sharing menu but we nixed that.   

We did start with some communal appetizers that were awesome.  And the Guava Margarita was great.  I had the veggie Tacos which I loved.  My co-workers with Snapper were less impressed.  They said it was chewy.  

Overall, decent Mexican but I'll bet Vegas has better to offer.  We just went here because we were all staying in the Red Rock.   Food was okay and our clients enjoyed it but they missed the early drama about the missing reservation. 

The food probably rates a 4, but I had to knock off the stars because of the mix up with our reservation and the way we were treated when it was all getting resolved.   Not sure this is the best place for large groups.  They ultimately came through, but I had serious doubts for a while.
