The cornbread and service were decent/tolerable. The food was also okay. The voodoo tuna was good but not worth spending 22 dollars on I would rather spend 8 more dollars and get quality fish and a lot bigger cut then what little they give you here. I wish I would have ordered fajitas or burger or even the fish tacos so I would feel like my mom got her money's worth. Definitely will not come back most likely unless I have no choice in the matter. My sister was supposed to have spicy pasta and it wasn't even remotely spicy. My mom got jambalaya thinking that it would come with rice like at yard house and she hates pasta mind you, so when they brought pasta she didn't want to be one of those annoying customers that sends stuff back so she basically was picking at her seafood off of the dish the whole time.  My brother got the Mac and cheese he seemed to like it but it seemed like 3/5 ppl didn't enjoy their food enough to want to come back.
