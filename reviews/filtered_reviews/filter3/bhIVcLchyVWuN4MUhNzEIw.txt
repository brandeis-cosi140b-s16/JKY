My wife and I have been waiting for weeks for the So-Cal Fish Taco Company to open in downtown Gilbert. We are locals who frequent four great restaurants already in that section of town (e.g., Postino, Joe's B.B.Q., Oregano's, and Liberty Market).  

First impression matters: It was crowded on the first Friday night opening. We were told there was a one hour wait.  This helped us decide on takeout.  

The fish tacos were nice and crunchy, but we felt that there could have been more fish sauce & cotija cheese.

The carnitas tacos were a little dry to us.  The beans tasted as if they were canned beans.  In house cooked beans have a fresher taste to them.  

As Parents we were concerned that we didn't see a children's menu.  This could still be in the making, however.    

Service was fast for the to go order. Service was friendly. (Still finding their way in terms of organizing the crowd, but we think that is normal for a restaurant that has just opened.)  

We see this venue becoming a local favorite if they subscribe to the enduring idea that quality drives business and customer service matters.  

Haven't had the clam chowda yet but since we spent ten years in Boston we are ready to offer our thoughts after our next visit.
