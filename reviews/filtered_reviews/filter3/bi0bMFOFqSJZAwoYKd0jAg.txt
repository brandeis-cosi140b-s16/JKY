Cheesy.  Truly, it's a little too cheesy for my tastes, although I've grown to accept this as a normal problem with these Americanized Mexican restaurants.  But this is a great little place that has dining inside and a take-out window outside.  It's a great place to pick up an enchilada-style burrito on the way home.
