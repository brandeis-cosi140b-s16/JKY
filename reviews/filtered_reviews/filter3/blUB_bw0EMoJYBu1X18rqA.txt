Went in on a slow Sunday afternoon. ..  barely anybody in the restaurant. .. including our server. She rarely came around, doing the absolute bare minimum. So she was lacking. No stars for her. BUT I  was satisfied w my meal. I had the steak burrito... And I'm a lil obsessed w the bacon wrapped jalape√±os! Sooo yummy!
