Grabbed some tacos on the way to my class today, after work. 2 fish tacos, 1 spicy chicken and 1 tea. Iced tea was disgusting and i told them so, they agreed and actually dumped all of their remaining tea out. I have gotten no apology, but did get a refill with watered down Horchata. 
Tacos were alright. Nothing really to write home about. Just average good taco. Does not qualify for a big deal in my book.
Stop by there or keep driving is totally up to you. If i were in your car i would have said - "Whatever".
