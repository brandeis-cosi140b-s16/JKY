This place only gets 3 stars in this review because the service was horribly slow.

I came here today for the first time since last summer.  My girlfriend and I were seated on the patio.  We walked out after 15 minutes of not a single server stopping by.

In the past, the food has been okay and everything is pricy.  The real draw here is the proximity to the rehab pool and the ambiance, views, and dare I say, talent.
