I hate writing a sub-par review for this place because for the last 6 years it has been my go-to place for recommendations to out-of-town guests and favorite for a great meal. It was always a solid choice. Service was always a bit "stiff" but usually because they were slammed - at least it was efficient. Food was always great.
I just took a group of valley visitors there for dinner and regrettably must echo the recent reviews that this place is slipping. So bummed to say this and only writing in the hope they might read this and other reviews and take steps to fix it before this goes the way of the Teepee.. 
Service was badly organized - busser brought waters 2 at a time to a table of 10. Use a tray! One drink list for the whole table - when I asked for some more I got another 1 only. Drink order got messed up. No explanation of specials, sides or advice for visitors who were curious about the menu. Recommendations from the waitress were the standard bloodsucker response of the most expensive thing on the menu. When the good arrived the plates were sloppier than usual. Food still tasted pretty good on most dishes but presentation was poor. Also  took a long time to get all the dishes to the table - maybe 8-10 minutes from first person getting their meal to last person being served. 
Just not as good an experience as I received a few months ago. Seems like a bunch of new staff and nobody enforcing standards, at the line or on the floor. 
I love this place but the experience I had could beat be described as "jaded" - and with the amount of good new restaurants around that is a real shame.
