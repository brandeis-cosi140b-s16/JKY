Had a Groupon ...2  entrees for free; so hubby and I dined there.  Since the Groupon was for lunch  we went on a Saturday a little after 3pm.  After we ordered, was told their lunch ended at 3pm so we couldn't use the Groupon. Menu advertised lunch/dinner items with no difference in prices. Meal was fine.  Waiter was somewhat standoffish with non-Hispanic customers.  

Didn't want to lose my money for the Groupon so we went back a week later before lunch hour was over.  Showed the Groupon before we ordered so there would be no more errors.  Was told the meal couldn't be over $21.98.  The stipulation on the Groupon didn't say that but whatever.  Our waiter was very nice and friendly.  The meal was good, however my husband wasn't impressed. Had never know of this place without he Groupon.  Very large and spacious restaurant.  Not very busy on both visits.

One Great thing, the food was delivered to our table in record time.  It was as if the cook heard us when we ordered the food.  

The salsa was better than most Mexican eateries. 
May come back when on a all ladies outing.
