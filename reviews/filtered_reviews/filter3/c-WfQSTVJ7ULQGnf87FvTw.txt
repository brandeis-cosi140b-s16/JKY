Best service I've received in a while from a little gal named Dina. 

Food was okay... nothing special. We got the appetizer platter. It had a couple sweet corn tamales, four wedges of quesadilla, and some steak and chicken skewers. 

Honestly, the food was not that memorable. The sweet corn tamales tasted like corn bread. Don't get me wrong. I love corn bread, but not when it's supposed to be a tamale. The masa was way too sweet. The steak skewer was the best thing on the platter. 

Service is why I bumped them from 2 to 3. :) She was awesome, but won't be back any time soon for the food.
