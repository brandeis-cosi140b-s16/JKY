Chips and salsa always make me happy. The Brava Burro was a mini-burrito with a side of lettuce, tomatos, and salsa. Inside the burrito is rice, refried beans, and I chose chicken over the option of shredded beef. The was some good spice used to heat up the meal and my tongue was on fire. But the tortilla was bland, and I could have whipped up the same type of meal at my house.

The patio area was the highlight of the restaurant, and had plenty of tables, and a large fountain, which created the illusion of water in the 98 degree heat.

$5.99 + $2 = $8 + tax and tip.
