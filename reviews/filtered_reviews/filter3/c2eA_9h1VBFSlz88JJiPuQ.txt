Went for our monthly lunch adventures with the ladies. The food was great, no complaints. I would've given a higher rating but the service was slow. He was great and had our orders done correctly but during the hour and a half only two of seven got our drinks refilled. By the time he came back around to our table we were ready for the check. Maybe they need more servers if he was the only one servicing both sides and outside of the restaurant?
