Carlos O'Brien's serves up large portions and offers your standard Mexican fare such as chimichangas, burros, tacos, and enchiladas.  They offer a few vegetarian options such as chile relleno and spinach enchiladas.  Chips and 2 types of salsa are served at the table prior to ordering.  The chips are very thin, and the mild salsa is very tomato based, while the hot salsa tastes a bit more authentic with a good robust chile flavor.  Feeling like I needed more greens in my diet, I opted for the spinach enchiladas for my dinner.

The enchiladas themselves tasted OK flavor-wise, but while I appreciate that they used fresh spinach, it wasn't cleaned very well and I would get mouthfuls of some grit occasionally when I chewed.  I tried some of the 3 way chimichanga, which tasted decent, but it was hard to find the green chili part of the chimichanga.  

Drinks were refilled promptly as needed, and service was generally good.
