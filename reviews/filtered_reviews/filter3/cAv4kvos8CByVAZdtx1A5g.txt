After picking my fiancee up in the morning, we took a quick look for some off-Strip food joints that were serving breakfast, and we ended up at Phat Phrank's on a Friday morning. At 10 AM in the morning or so, it was pretty empty, so we were able to order right away, and our food came our relatively quickly (around 5 minutes or so after we placed the order). I went with the barbacoa breakfast platter, while my fiancee went with the huevos rancheros. Both were really good - the barbacoa was cooked enough so that it shredded easily, and it really goes well with solidly-done scrambled eggs. I do say I wish I could have combined it with the huevos rancheros' pepper sauce, which added a real nice kick to her dish and made the dish flavors much more vibrant. While I like the idea of the thinly-sliced fried potatoes (they sure looked like plantain chips, but they definitely tasted like potatoes), they're a bit on the light side. Given the rest of the meal is relatively hearty, I think a bigger serving, or adding a side of Mexican-style rice, would have been a better way to round out the dish.

I'd like to come back sometime to try the regular offerings, but breakfast on its own was okay. It's better than your average breakfast, but I've had better Mexican-inspired breakfast dishes at other places.
