The food is easily 4 or 5 stars. I'm giving it 3 for everything else that was just abysmal. I've gotten the taco plater a few times and all the tacos I've tried are great. The boyfriend got the frito burrito and loved it. 

The room we ate in was the large one in the back. It was obnoxiously loud due to a large group there. We all left with pounding headaches. Several babies cried from the noise a few times -- no joke. The service was also painfully slow. I got water and somehow that took longer than multiple drinks from the bar. It took 10 minutes to get a refill and over 10 just to get the waitress to take the check. Restaurants shouldn't make it hard for you to pay. 

The food is so good I'll be back or at least get takeout from there, but this particular experience left a sour taste in my mouth. Free chips when you check in on yelp though!
