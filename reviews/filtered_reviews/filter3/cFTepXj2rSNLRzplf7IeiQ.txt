For me it was just ok. I ordered a carne asada torta because I've always felt you can't go wrong with carne asada. I was right in saying that but lately I haven't been real big on bread, the bread for the torta was thick and when I eat a torta the the bread is usually pretty thin. The value was not all that great either although it did come with avocado which can be expensive at times, it seems as though the box was just thrown together with the sandwich and some chips the presentation was not great at all. 

I won't think twice about eating at cilantro if I'm near it chances are I probably won't stop, I'll keep going until I find something else I would like to eat.
