You've got to appreciate a bar that has actual sand you can sink your toes into, bringing a little bit of the beach to the Valley.

At the Desert Ridge location of Sand Bar (there are three in the Valley), there's a massive bar in the center of the outdoor patio, along with a ton of umbrella-covered tables atop the sand, as well as a big indoor restaurant.

The bar is full-service and has a slew of televisions, and there are also three more secluded cabanas with ultra-comfy couches and televisions.

This past Sunday, my friend and I were surprised to see no one was sitting at the cabanas, and we got our own private viewing party at one after requesting to sit there.

I've only had the food at Sand Bar once, but it was nothing special and definitely not something I'd crave. I did like the endless bucket of chips ($5) and two types of salsa (the green is my favorite), but I'd stick to that if you want food.

The cheese enchiladas ($8.99) were rubbery and forgettable, and I didn't enjoy the red sauce that covered them. The saving grace of the dish was the rice, but even that didn't stand out.

Instead, go to Sand Bar for an island-y atmosphere and a ton of viewing options. Even though all the TV's at the bar displayed football games, the bartender had no problem turning on the Diamondbacks for us at the cabana, and the service there has always been great for me.
