If you are in the mood for Mexican this is NOT the place for you!  Sure they have margarita's and even a few Spanish words on the menu but that is really where the similarities end.

I was there on a Saturday night and the place was busy, so that could be why the service was brutal- we had to ask for things multiple times before they came and the waitress wasn't familiar with the bar or even the menu.  As for the food I ordered a chimichunga it was okay but I wouldn't order it again.  It was as if they are trying too hard to make it different, if that's the case the succeeded.  However, I think they should have focused on making it better.
