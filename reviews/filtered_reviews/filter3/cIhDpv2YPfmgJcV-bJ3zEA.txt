Overview:
Mad Mex is a popular, dimly lit, trendy Mexican restaurant/bar on S Highland Ave pretty close to the plaza with Chipotle/Whole Foods that I visited as a part of a large group for a pre-interview dinner.

The Food:
Perhaps I am not the best person to talk about the food here because we did not have a traditional meal here. We were served buffet, BYOT (build-your-own-taco) style, and given a standard array of chicken, lettuce, salsas, and soft tortillas. We were served on their second story dining table which is basically a indoor balcony that seats a little over 20 people. I didn't find the food to be very special in any way, and thought the open room wasn't the best place for people to talk due to noise from the bottom stories.

The Establishment:
Situated on a row of shops rather than in a plaza, I'm not exactly sure where people park. When I came here, I ended up parking in the Whole Foods plaza which was about a quarter mile away. It's very dimly lit, and fairly loud, but was upscale in that most of the furniture was good heavy wood and the bathrooms were classy and clean. There is a large bar to your left as you enter that I did not try out.

The Service:
I can't really comment as I came with a large private group. After our initial drink orders, I didn't meet a waiter again.

Conclusions:
Mad Mex was a decent restaurant for our large group (~20 people) but unfortunately I was not impressed by the food. I do have to warn readers that my experience was likely marred because buffet-style food has to appeal to the broadest audience and I do favor adventurous places that take chances with their cooking. Mad Mex has a trendy vibe that will appeal to most young people and seems well suited for small groups of young adults.
