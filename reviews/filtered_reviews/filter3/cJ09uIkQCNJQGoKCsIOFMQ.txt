Very disappointingly 'eh' experience.

The tacos are excellent, let's get that out of the way. The guys pitching you the tacos are friendly and do a great job.

The front-end staff though pretty much kills it for me. They took forever to get us rung up and even so they rung us up incorrectly (there were four of us it's not like there were 20)... As such, the line was long and when I didn't get something I paid for and tried to go up front to get it they wanted to take a freaking inventory of my meal to ensure I wasn't scamming them for chips.  

Additionally the pricing just wasn't there for me for a walk-up place like this. I was hoping for a better experience.
