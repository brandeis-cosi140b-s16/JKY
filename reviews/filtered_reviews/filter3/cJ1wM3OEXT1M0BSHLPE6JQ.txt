The place was fast and staff friendly food not bad but the reason why I gave it 3 stars is because it's way overpriced for half the food you get a robertos with similar taste however the fresh fruit water was on point. I don't think I will be coming here again just because of the overpriced 5 bucks for one taco is too much for me.
