I have been to Sylvia's many times. I think they are about average for a Mexican food restaurant in Phoenix. I have had their Chimichangas, green chile burritos, red chile burritos and their bean burritos. 

Their best item is the refried beans. If you are interested in a delicious bean burrito, this is your place. If you are making something that would be complemented with refried beans, come in and order a pint because these beans are delicious. Their tortillas are pretty standard, I think Carolina's make a better tortilla. I think the enchilada sauce could be better but it isn't the worst enchilada sauce I have ever had. 

They have a pretty large bar on 7th ave and Missouri with excellent happy hour specials and live music.
