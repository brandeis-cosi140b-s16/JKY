OK actually I would give it 3.5 Stars!  Here is a run down of what I had today...

I love that they actually use corn tortillas for their tacos and the give you 3 different kinds of salsa and a side of grilled onions and jalapenos, which are really good.
Chorizo Tacos- The chorizo was a bright pink color. I really couldn't taste the actual chorizo flavor with the onions and cilantro on top.

Carne Asada Tacos- I found the carne asada to be a little greasy with not a whole lot of flavor. But if you add the grilled onions and jalapenos then it is a lot more flavorful.

Black Beans- Now I normally don't order black beans but something told me I should.  It was more like a black bean soup.  I liked the flavor.

I saw a few things on the menu that I would maybe come back to try.  They have menudo, which is rare on menus anymore.  I wouldn't say they were the best tacos I have had, but maybe they are the best that Phoenix has....definitely cheaper and more creative than America's Taco Shop.
