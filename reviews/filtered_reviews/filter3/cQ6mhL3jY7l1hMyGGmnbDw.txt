Good morning Sergé, Omg!  Unpersonable, mad faced bartenders. Their is a reason we haven't been here in a long time. . Disappointed!!  Although, The food is amazing!! Actually it would have been 1 star if it was based on the service.  By the way I'm the one that ordered Jordan Chardonnay, And then I asked you about the rosé,  if it's French style. And you said it's Italian. I know it's Italian.  You should turn your frown upside down.  I love where I work. If you don't love where you work, You shouldn't work there. Same goes for the girl who was your barback or bartender.
