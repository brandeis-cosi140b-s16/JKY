Went here for Cinco de Mayo dinner.  Hostess told us the wait was about 45 minutes and I think we were seating in a little less than that.  However watching the bus staff, they definitely could have been a little quicker in turning over the tables.  They also don't have a bar to sit in while you wait; just a couple small benches at the entrance.

The atmosphere is nice and has a nice cantina feel to it.  Once we were seating, they brought the free chips and salsa immediately.  Guacamole is extra and was good (chunky and not watered down like a previous reviewer's was, so it may be hit or miss).  The owner roams around the restraurant and he brought us our food no more than 5 minutes after we ordered, as we simply ordered burritos and tacos.  I got the carne asada burrito enchilada style for around 10 bucks, and it was very good.  The best deal may be the tacos (2 a la carte for about $6).

The weak point at this place was the service.  After we got our food, our waiter all but disappeared  for at least a half an hour, leaving me wanting another margarita but not getting one.  Once they finally came around to take our plates away, I found myself thinking ahead "do we want more chips? another taco?" as I wasn't sure the next time we would get that chance.  A sign of poor service in my opinion.  Even as the place started to clear out and we were just sitting around talking, they didnt bring us our check until we were one of the last tables still there.

Overall, the food was tasty and I had an very enjoyable experience, mostly because of good company.  But I'm pretty sure we could of had that at a bunch of other places too.
