A few months ago someone told me the best chips and salsa and guacamole was at some Blanco place at The Clarendon. I went there to find that it had closed. I was told the chef went over to Otro Cafe.

I eventually found it and went in to get some chips and salsa. First, they neglected to tell me they didn't actually have salsa. They had a green Chile salsa and a Chipotle salsa, but not the typical chunky salsa with tomatoes and such. Second, somehow the chips were stale, yet the bag managed to leave grease stains on my counter at home. The guacamole was good, though. Most people put too much garlic powder in their recipe, but this was just right.

I haven't tried their menu yet, but for the price I paid (like $8) for stale chips and not salsa, I'm not sure I'm willing to venture a night out with friends to overpay for  food that may or may not be quality.
