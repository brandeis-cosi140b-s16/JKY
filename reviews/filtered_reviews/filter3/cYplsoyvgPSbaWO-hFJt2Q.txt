Was in chuys the other day got the shrimp tacos. They were ok, nice heaping shrimp on a good soft taco. Basic refried beans and rice combo.My only complaint was the sauce to protein ratio. I got like 1 squirt in the corner of the taco and it was incredible, I just wanted more to go with the huge shrimp. The bulk of the meal left me needing a lot of water just because it was a bit dry, but delicious. Service was good, loved the layout, sit on the patio if you can.
