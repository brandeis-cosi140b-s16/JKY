I'm taking a stand in rounding up to 3 stars.  I got there just after 9pm and was relegated to the drive-thru, so I can understand that I didn't get the optimal dining experience.  Even after a short car ride home, the burger was still great.  The onions and tomato were too thick and assertive for my taste, but the sandwich was meaty and delicious.  The "special sauce" provided flavor, without overwhelming.  This place is a good comparison for In & Out, where the burgers are also fantastic and the fries are subpar.  These fries had a nice subtle garlic pepper seasoning, but they were soggy and flaccid.  (Maybe that's only because of the time driving home.)
The shake, however, was the biggest disappointment.  It was a below-average chocolate shake.  It had a malty flavor to it, and the straw looked like some giant breathing tube for asthmatics.  It collapsed on every sip.
Add the fries and the shake to the high price tag, and you get a 2-star review... but the burger was good, and I'm holding out hope for a better experience next time.
