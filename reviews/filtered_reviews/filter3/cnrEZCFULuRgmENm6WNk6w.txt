Dude, the weirdest chile rellenos I have ever seen.  A bed of chile's topped with a meringue and green sauce, WTF?  I am glad that I ordered a burrito and enchilada myself, both of which we good.  I made the burrito the shredded beef, it was good, but not worth the up charge, or special attention that it was to garner.

Margaritas are rather weak.

We were in the area, and I am glad that we stopped in once, my dad has been hearing about this place for sometime, but it was a nice one stop place, and no where near a regular place, or even special occasion joint.  Los Dos Molinos is far superior, and further away than this little place.

The restrooms are cramped little private rooms that are very clean and stocked and have a some character to them.  3.75 Flushes.
