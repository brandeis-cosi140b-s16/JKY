Heard mixed reviews, and they were on groupon so thought I would try it. Beans were cooked to the plate, rice was undercooked, and beef in the burrito tasted like rubber- way overcooked with no seasoning! The only reason why I am rating 3 stars is for the excellent customer service! They were on top of things, smiles and all!
