I've got Vegas-on-the-mind cuz I'm going there next weekend, so bear with me on the next couple of reviews...

It really figures that The Hard Rock Hotel would have a restaurant with this name. (not a fan of the Hard Rock) Anyhoo, I ended up here after having spent all day making sweet "mouth love" to a large football-shaped drink in the Tropicana Pool. (never again) I was told this place would be "really tasty", and I have to say it was a little bit of a let down. Really, really average "mexican" food at best. I think I had some sort of lackluster enchilada plate with a creamy cilantro sauce. (the sauce was actually pretty good) Also, I remember having corn on the cob and it being DELICIOUS--it had some sort of garlic/mayo coating on it--sounds gross, but I assure you it wasn't! (NO idea why they served corn on the cob, btw) Honestly, this place earns 3 stars solely for the deelish corn and the margaritas. 

Sorry this review is so vague....but it's Vegas and I'm pretty sure I killed alot of brain cells that weekend.
