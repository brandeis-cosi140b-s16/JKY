I'm a Jose Andres groupie, when I started going to Jaleo in DC over 10 years ago. When I saw this was a not so expensive option for dining in LV last week, my friend and I walked right in. There was a 20 minute wait, but we were able to take a seat at the bar immediately. Had a salt air margarita which was FABULOUS. ordered a few different dishes: tacos - pancita & carnitas, noodles, something from the dim sum menu and chips with guacamole. The food was good. The ambiance was fun. The bill and the margarita were truly the highlights of the dinner. Check it out as an option for upscale fast food if you are at or near the Cosmopolitan.
