In the area from out of town looking for some good mexican food to takeaway.  As others have mentioned, it is a hole in the wall kind of place that is easy to miss but the food is decent.  I would say it's not "drive across town good" but a solidly good place if you're in the area.  I had the carne asada tacos (#6 on the menu) which were good, but I probably should have stopped by the salsa bar since they were a little dry.  We also ordered chips & guacamole - chips were good however the guacamole seemed thin and runny not chunky as I typically prefer.
