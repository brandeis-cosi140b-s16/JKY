My sons brought me here for Mother's Day.  It was busy, but we didn't have to wait as long as we thought.  We were seated in about 20 minutes and our waiter was prompt and courteous.  I ordered the agave margarita which was very bland.  I had a shredded beef enchilada and a chicken enchilada served with refried beans and papas con chile (yummy).  The shredded beef was very flavorful, but there wasn't much chicken in the chicken enchilada.  It was a prefect amount of food for me - not too much.  My boys and husband enjoyed their meals as well.

Atmosphere is pretty loud with all the customers.  Lots of kids being Mother's Day.  We will have to try it again on a non-holiday.
