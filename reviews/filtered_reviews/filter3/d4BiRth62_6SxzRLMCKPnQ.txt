I gotta say, I do not see where the rave reviews for ATS come from. I get the niche vegan group but, aside from the chain being named best carne asada by a local paper, I find the restaurant underwhelming. Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad -- the place is clean, has its own style, and has found success with shops all around town now. But I find the menu limited, the prices high, and the food just okay.

But when out of towners visit looking for the Best Mexican food, I steer elsewhere.
