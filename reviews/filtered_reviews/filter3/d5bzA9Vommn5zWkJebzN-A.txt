I really wanted to love this place but wasn't impressive at all. 

The ordering process is a little bit confusing, but the people there are super kind and helpful. Extra star for that.

Besides that, the food is nothing to die for. It worth the stop if you're in the area but definitely wouldn't drive more than 5 miles just to eat there.

Cheers.

PS Prices are fair.
