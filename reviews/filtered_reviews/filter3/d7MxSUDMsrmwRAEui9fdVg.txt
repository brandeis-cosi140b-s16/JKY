Ventured forth to the Pink Taco for my birthday dinner, happily clutching a restaurant.com gift certificate in my chubby little hand.  It was a warm Sunday evening and since we are both smokers, we opted for patio dining.  

The Rehab party was in full swing at the pool, which borders the Pink Taco patio, so conversation at normal decibles was not an option, but the people watching was pretty good.  Lots of hard-bodies strutting their tats and designer sunglasses. But I digress.  Back to the chow ...

I had the carne asada platter and it was good - steak was tender and flavorful. My friend had the carnitas, which was disappointingly dry. The freshly made tortillas were mucho goodo, and the trio of salsas that they deliver with the chips are quite tasty!  The rice and beans were ho-hum, but it is pretty hard to make those jump off of any plate.

Margaritas were yummy, but overpriced, although this IS Vegas and we WERE at the Hard Rock, so it was expected. 

Service was average.  I did appreciate the waitress giving me a heads up to check the seat cushion before I sat down, since "Rehab"-ers sit on the patio a lot and the cushions can become damp from moist booty.

I will probably return in the future, just because it is one of the few restaurants in town that has outdoor seating where the tobacco-inclined are welcomed.
