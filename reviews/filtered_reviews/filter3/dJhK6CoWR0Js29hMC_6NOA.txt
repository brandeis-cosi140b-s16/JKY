The food in my opinion is very Americanized but was pretty good.  I was there with a group of ladies for a Bachelorette Party on a Friday night so they were somewhat busy. 

The chips and salsa they leave on the table are delicious. I love the baked chips and the salsa is the perfect blend of spicy but not too spicy.  Once I had a chance to look at there really cool electronic drink menu I decided on a frozen strawberry Margarita. The drink was super delicious! It was pretty awesome that you could create your own Margarita though. One side of there drink menu was the create your own Margarita and the other was a list of cocktails they offered. 

I decided on the Pork Carnitas street tacos for dinner. They came with a side of black beans and a choice of rice either Mexican or cilantro.  The meal was three small tacos with guacamole and salsa on the side of the plate. The tacos were just ok in my opinion. Personally nothing spectacular but not horrible either. I thought they were kinda of dry and needed just a little more sauce to make them better. I just used extra salsa to enjoy them a little more then I would have normally. 

Now price wise this is pretty expensive for Mexican but it is on the strip so that is what you get. People should not be surprised at how expensive it can be. On top of being a pretty expensive meal for one person because I was with a party of 8 or more thy added gratuity. Gratuity ended up being $6 for everyone which I thought was decent for Vegas pricing. 

The thing I really enjoyed was the decor and ambiance of Yolos. I loved the colors and lighting. Also we had excellent service from a very attentive waiter who was wonderful at helping a large group.
