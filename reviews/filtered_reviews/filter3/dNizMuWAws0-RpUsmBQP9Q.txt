I give solid 3 stars. Thursday night group of 6.slow in the beginning from host to food. We had to put together our own table open mic area.waoted about 5-10 min on drinks another on menus.SErver was very friendly just think it tough on 1 server to work a bunch of people. There was a 10 top, 3, 4 and few others.the salsa was really good.the chips where mix flour and corn witch I like.i had shrimp taco thinking it would be breaded however no breading witch didn't set well with a flour tortilla as taco. Rice and beans really good everyone else food looked good but mine was avg. I recommend breading the shrimp and maybe a Chipotle mayo sauce
