One of those neighborhood favorites.  It's similar to Tito's Taco's in Culver City, California but with a bigger and better menu.  People just seem to love this place.  It's a dicey neighborhood but people from all walks of life do come here.  Lock your car!!!

I loved the chimichanga with guacamole and sour cream.......  Yummy.

No doubt this is a place to visit,  it's grimy inside and out but it adds to the experience.......   I'd go back anytime......
