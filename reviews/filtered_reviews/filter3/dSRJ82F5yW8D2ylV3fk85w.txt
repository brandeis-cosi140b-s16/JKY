What's the deal with Rokerij and Richardson's?  We thought we were hanging out at Rokerij and it turned out to be Richardson's.  They aren't the same place but they are in the same place?  The valet parking is set up so that it drops you off at Richardson's entrance, see the confusion?

As we were sitting there I remember thinking, "I don't know what all the fuss is about."  The oysters were good, the wine was alright, the ambiance was okay - western decor isn't really my thing.  My friend and I sat at the bar and the bartender was sweet but not really attentive.  Hopefully we'll pick door number two next time and end up at the right place.
