My first time at this place finally, and I actually like it more than I thought I would!

The atmosphere is great, I really liked the open feel of the booths and dining area. There is a pretty small bar area too. 

Waitress was very nice, attentive, and there when we needed something.

We started with corizo queso dip. Which I loved. The little bit of smokiness from the corizo blended really nicely with the cheese.
I got ground beef enchiladas, they were good, but the sauce was a little different than what I am used to. Something in it just did not taste right, but my wife liked it a lot so just a personal preference there. 
My better half got the chili rellenos. She said the best she has ever had.

This is one of those time I really wish I could give half stars. A solid 3 1/2.

Overall good night, can't wait to go back and order something I will actually really like this time!
