I went to Aunt Chilada's at the recommendation of a friend who used to bartend there. 

When I arrived, I was immediately asked if I was meeting a party here. Nope, it's just me... I was seated and brought a menu along with flour tortilla chips (yum!) and salsa. 

I started with the cheese crisp. This thing was amazing!! It was a cross between a sauceless pizza and an open faced corn quesadilla. So good. In retrospect, I would've finished that and eaten less of everything else.

From there, I ordered the 2 combo plate: Cheese enchilada (how could I go to a place named Aunt Chilada's and not order one...) and chicken taco. The enchilada was good, and the sour cream I ordered with it had an almost whipped texture. I took one bite of the taco, and decided against it. It was a crunchy corn tortilla, the chicken was breaded and fried (crispy chicken in a taco?). 

If I went back, I'd stick to the cheese crisp and a 1 entree plate.

There is also a banquest room, and a large outdoor seating area with a bar and bocci ball court.
