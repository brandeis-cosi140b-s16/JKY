I really want to give this place a better review, because it's jaw-droppingly gorgeous and I wanted to love it...but I didn't.

They just opened, so I'm hoping they are just working out some kinks.  The chips and salsa were great, but the food was just so-so.  I ordered a tamale, and the husband ordered some mole enchiladas--neither one of us thought the food was bad, it just wasn't our favorite.  The portions are also pretty small for the price, if that's something that bothers you.  (I didn't leave feeling hungry, I'm just saying.)  There are some really unique/authentic dishes on the menu compared to the usual Mexican places around town.

I ordered a glass of wine and he ordered a beer--another table had margaritas that looked awesome, so I think if we come back it will be a drinks/appetizers situation.  It's downstairs, kind of dark, romantically lit, and has an old-school Mexican vibe that makes you feel like you're going to run into Zorro or something.  Definitely would be a good date-night spot if you're adventurous!
