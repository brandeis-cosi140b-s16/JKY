SUPER long wait time for a table. We went on a Friday at about 5pm and had to wait about 45min for a table and there was hardly any room to stand.  The bar is located towards the front of the restaurant, which is smart but it's way too small during happy hour. 

They have a second bar towards the back but it's more for the people sitting in the patio area.  They have misters in the summer and heating lamps in the winter.  I didn't see anyone eating in the patio area tho, they were mostly drinking so I'm not sure if you can actually order food from there since the seating is more lounge(y) with no actual tables except for small coffee tables. 

As of Sept 16, 2014, they have  1/2 priced appetizers during Happy Hour, and $4.50 house margaritas, $3 Mexican drafts, and $4 house wine.  

Food was pretty good - I would describe their menu as mexican-american.  If you plan on going during happy hour on a Friday, expect a wait or make reservations!
