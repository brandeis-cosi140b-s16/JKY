Can't relate to the negative reviews here ..... been going to Dona Maria over the past 12 years whenever in Las Vegas with a hankering for Mexican ...... always good dependable tasty standard Mexican fare . Good solid burritos,tacos and tasty salsa,rice and refrieds........ quick service..... reasonable pricing...... never had anything but a good,pleasant meal here .
