My husband really likes this place. This was where he wanted to go for his birthday. I am neutral about this place. It can be pretty good, but its not the freshest, most innovative mexican. There are not very many healthy options. Everything is very heavy, greasy, huge, and covered in cheese. Now this type of food can be appealing, especially if you had too many drinks the night before. I still like to find healthier dishes though, and it is hard here.

The service is friendly though. Be warned Peorians/Glendalians love this place and it can get pretty crowded so you might have a bit of a wait. 

One thing I absolutely do not like is that most tables are raised, so the high chairs are either too low or have to be stacked on top of each other. They are also sticking out in the path of the waiters. Last time we went, a waiter carried a sizzling place of fajitas right over my babies head. OMG I almost had a heart attack and just kept her on my lap. It was so scary. 

Basically, its like normal American style mexican food. I just feel that I am in Phoenix, and can get more legit mexican elsewhere.
