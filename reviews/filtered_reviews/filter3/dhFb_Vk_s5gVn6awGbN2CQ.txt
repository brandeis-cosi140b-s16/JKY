Service started out slow. We had been sitting for over 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. Took our drink order and then hurried away before I had finished. Did the same thing when we were ordering our food...had to reel him back in just to finish the order.

Food was actually pretty good for airport food. The chicken quesadilla was average but the pork nachos were delicious.
