Even though true Mexican dishes are terrific, sadly so many Mexican restaurants serve gloppy, over-sauced dishes that this style has been termed "typical Mexican".

Well this restaurant would fit the "typical" bill. The fish tacos were fair at best, with none of that really fresh fish taste you get at some places, and the "Camarones Autnentico" were small to medium shrimp swimming in a not so flavorful sauce. Other dishes were all Mexican mediocre chain quality.

The Sopapillas for dessert were neither fluffy nor tender.

Service was very good, atmosphere nice with a small pond in the middle, and their salsa and chips excellent. It may be a good stop for a few beers and chips, but other than that not worth a visit.
