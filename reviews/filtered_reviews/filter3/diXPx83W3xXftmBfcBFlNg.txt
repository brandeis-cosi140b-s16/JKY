So after a most mediocre meal last night I'm still wondering how this place is so positively Yelped? Please don't get me wrong.. CT is a great hang out and is VERY well priced with huge portions but, quality over quantity is a sound rule that for my experience didn't hold true. 

We sat for about 15 minutes before we're even acknowledged by our waiter.. I was so thirsty I almost took my chances and drank from the pool on the patio.. who knows what was in that water but I was SO ready to find out when our waiter showed. Once we got moving the service was decent though one of the entrees was nearly 10 behinds behind the rest. So of course we waited for that entree to come out while ours got cold so we could eat together. Pretty annoying though forgivable I suppose. What wasn't forgivable were the screaming kids that were playing around the pool as their stupid parents sat there and got drunk. How can you enjoy a meal when there are babies crying and children playing.. it seemed like fucking Romper Room instead of a TAVERN! *Sigh* I miss Lambchop!

The food.. eh.. so so. The Pork Adovada sauce was bitter to the point of needing to drown it in sour cream to take the edge off. Me personally would have sent it back but there were other powers that be. The Rotisserie Chicken wasn't better then something you can get at your local grocery, though Id have to say that the groceries are far more moist and flavorful. There were 2 standouts.. Habaero Cheeseburger and the Green Chile Mac 'n Cheese.. both very very tasty! 

We will certainly come back here from time to time but there are other old reliables that make better New Mexican food in Scottsdale.
