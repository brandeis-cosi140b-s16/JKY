We've been trying to get into this place for weeks. Something about Mexican food for me is that you have to be in the mood for it, stars in the universe have to align just right ,not to mention it helps to be in the area. One thing that caught my eye is their closed in Sunday's, on their door it says we take care of you and take care our employees by giving them Sunday's off (not exact verbiage). 

You walk in and it has a Chiptole or Cafe Rio style type serving method. Assembly line where they take your order along the way. I ordered the quesadilla and a large shrimp cocktail, apparently the shrimp cocktails are bomb ass and the pictures from fellow yelpers looked good to! After you pay they give you a number for your table and you sit your ass down and wait. 

We didn't have to wait long at all, fast service! I wasn't impressed with my quesadilla, I felt they could have filled it up more (picture of inside attached), stingy with the meat! The redeeming factor was the shrimp cocktail. HOLY SHIT! this was definitely a homage to the shrimp gods as I was more than satisfied with this. Tons of shrimp, the flavor was really good to. 

One thing I didn't like was when they brought the food I asked for water and the server just pointed to the machine. It's like really!? After I tipped a few bucks (uncomfortable if you don't, since it's on the receipt and they stare at you). She points to get it myself. I know I know I get it, it's not fine dining but if that's the case then put a tip jar there not a tip spot on the receipt then pretty much tell me to get the drink myself. Cause then your just another fast food place. 

Come here for the shrimp cocktail, it's totally worth the $15, will be returning for this.
