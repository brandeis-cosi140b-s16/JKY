From the reviews, I was expecting better. I tried the asada and pastor tacos and the meat was good, not the best in Vegas by any means, but standing in the different lines for different meats and then standing in yet another line to pay is a real pain. I would think they could simplify the system and probably save some money on all of the duplicated labor.

I ordered multiple tacos with everything, but they were inconsistent: All three asada tacos had meat, but only one had guac, two had cilantro and onions and only one tasted like it had any salsa. I went to look for some salsa, but only found limes and radishes. A tad disappointing.
