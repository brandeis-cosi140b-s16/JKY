Stopped here for breakfast. It's typical of all airport food, its either frozen or otherwise all pre made food, and it costs way too much! 

I had the fruit and yogurt plate. Most of fruit was ripe, usually not the case in situations like this. Also, the bowl of yogurt was large, there was no way I could finish. 

My husband got the breakfast burrito. Which as shown on the menu is just tortilla, eggs, sour cream, salsa, and potatoes on the side. It costs extra for cheese and meat to be added to your plain burrito. The whole this was much better than I expected, the flavor was quite good for airport dinning! 

I was a little sad at the lack of decaf beverage options. I wanted something warm and decaf, like tea or hot chocolate or even a decaf coffee, and the waitress insisted that they had nothing.
