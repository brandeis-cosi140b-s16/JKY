I had really HIGH hopes for here.  I'd read in a few locals magazines how outstanding they were.  So after finding a huge line at BJ we decided to bag it and headed across the parking lot to Agave.  

No line on a Saturday night on a holiday weekend should have been a clue.  

We were seated immediately. Our waiter appeared to take our drink order.  We never got the obligatory chips or water even though we asked for it.  there were maybe 5 tables total in the area we were in and I guess the baseball recap of the Mets v Nationals was much more important than customers.  

Our drinks came out of 2 only 1 was correct so that's a 50% or 2.5 stars.  

We ordered appetizers & dinner.  Our appetizers came out and within 5 minutes our food also came out. While I thought the whole purpose for appetizers was to savor them then have the meal.  I did want another margarita but the waiter seemed to have disappeared.  Finally we flagged him down and asked for to-go boxes & a bag along with the check.  

2 appetizers & 1 order of tacos, 2 cocktails $60.00.  

We had the tacos this morning for breakfast..not to bad.  had the packed up quesodilla for dinner..again not to bad.  

I wish someone could come up with a concept that marries cool atmosphere with good food & service.  

I still think our little hole in the wall, while not so chic, still has the best Mex in town.
