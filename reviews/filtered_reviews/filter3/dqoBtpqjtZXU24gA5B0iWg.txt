First you need to like spicy food!  Tex - Mex: Hatch chili spicy.  I have been here for lunch a couple of times - tried their burrito (green chili) $10 and the Green chili stew ($15).  The lunch menu is very pricy!  The place is cluttered, at least the bar area, but I think it was clean.

Bottom line:  If you like spicy food and don't mind spending 50% more than you should for a good meal; then I'd say try it.  The receipts are good, just over priced.  If you don't like spicy - don't come here.
