Over Christmas Break, four friends and I wanted to have dinner at RuRu's. Given the holidays and the size of our party, I decided to make a reservation about 2 weeks in advance.

On making a reservation: No Open Table. You need to call.

On the atmosphere: Maybe it was because of the holidays, maybe because it's a new hot spot in Myers Park - the place was packed. Good thing I made a reservation. The patio is going to be fabulous in the spring...and maybe even give Selwyn a run for it's money.

On the drinks: Three of my friends got margaritas, and they all said the margs were on the sweet side. I really enjoy the smokiness of mezcal, so I opted for the "I Love the Smell of Napalm". The drink was perfectly balanced - the rosemary syrup did not overpower.

On the food: Very funny dish names. We started out with "Three Amigos". The quest blanco was parked in front of me and I could not stop. I ordered "Fat Guy in a Little Coat" and "Long Duk Dong" with a side of the white beans. Both tacos were delicious. Beans were ho hum. Next time, I'd skip the white beans and get another taco - probably "Uncle Buck".
