I went there last night for dinner with friends. It's a HUUUGE place...doesn't look that big from the outside, but it's a sprawling establishment. Around 6:30 on a Thursday, they were running full. I would have loved to sit outside on the patio because the weather was so perfect, but we just opted for the first available seats, which were inside. My friend was hungry, so she ordered the Aunt Chilada dip (refried beans, sour cream, guac, and ground beef), and some drinks from the bar. Nothing stellar so far. The waitress came to take our orders as soon as we sat down. I got the Tacos de Pescado, my friends got flautas and tamales. We got salsa and chips to start with. The order came really fast, while we were still finishing our starters. I liked my tacos, though I wish the fish was a little more flavorful and spicy. I added lemon juice liberally and salsa, which made up for the blandness somewhat. My friends said their food was good, though far from authentic. I give three stars to this place mostly because of its ambience. I wish the waitresses would give diners more time at the table though..i felt a tad rushed. But maybe that was because of the crowd. Yeah, I can sure go back here again.
