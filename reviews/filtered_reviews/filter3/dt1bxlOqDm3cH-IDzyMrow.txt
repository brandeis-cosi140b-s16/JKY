Did you ever have a little insignificant almost not worthy mentioning kind of thing happen while dining being a precursor to things to come?

It started with my iced tea. It was an unexpected fruity flavor but what really annoyed me was the very old orange slice hanging on my glass. I could tell by looking at it that it's been around for at least more than a day. That sort became a kiss death in my opinion and maybe blemished my experience a little bit. 

They started us off with a generous amount of chips and salsas. The chips were fresh and slightly on the thick side. The salsas were both unique one was a very limey tomatillo and the other was a creamy very spicy red that had a smokiness to it with a slightly bitter taste to it.

I had the smaller sized Quinoa salad that was mostly quinoa. I thought the salad was OK. I liked the pumpkin and local yulu seeds in it. I also thought the sweet roasted corn in it was a nice touch and it would have been better with just a little more roasted corn.  I would have enjoyed the salad more if I didn't add the chicken because I didn't care for the taste of the chicken. I"M NOT SAYING IT WAS BAD in any way but it had that similar taste to it that the hot sauce had that I didn't care for. It was something smokey and the salad flavors, the fruity iced tea and the smokey chicken just didn't taste good together for me. But I note that's just me and anybody else might like it.

My husband had what they called Paella. He said it was OK as a chicken with salsa and rice in a skillet kind of meal. It didn't have the crust of rice one expects at the bottom to be paella and the rice was mushy but OK. It seemed like more salsa than broth. He didn't recognize anything pork in the dish but was told it was in there when he asked about it.

I just kept looking at that falling apart soggy orange slice...........

I do note they have a nice patio for al fresco dining.
