History and nostalgia only will take you so far. La Pinata has been here for a very long time and servs decent quality mexican food. However it is nothing special or unique.

The fast service the chips was apreciated by all, the lunch menu has many options than end up costing ~$10-12 with tax and tip. 

It is hard to say much else as this place is simple mexican and my enchilada was decent.,
