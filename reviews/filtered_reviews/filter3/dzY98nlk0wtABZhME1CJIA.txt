I've been sick on my little holiday, and while I have a tendency to eat my way through a new city with an unlimited budget, good old affordable mexican sounded just right for post nasal drip and sore throat.

*Be prepared for very, very loud music.
*Not a ray of sun shines into this building.  
*I wanted to sit in the garden during this summer "cold spell" of 70 degrees - but we were denied.  (Seriously the perfect temp for al fresco dining.)
*Top shelf margaritas will run you $10. Is it just me or does that seem like a lot for a hole in the wall in AZ?

Yelpers seem to love this place; we liked it just fine.  We got one fish dish and the carne asada platter with cheese enchilada.  When in doubt, stick with the fish.  The meat was very average in quality and flavor.  The grilled fish was fantastic.  A bit of a miscommunication between my husband and the waitress about being gluten free.  The serving staff and owner were very kind, apologetic, and made immediate strides to whip something else up.  All in all, a respectable time.
