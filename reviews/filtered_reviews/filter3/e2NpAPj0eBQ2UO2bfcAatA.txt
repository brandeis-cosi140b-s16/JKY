Met some friends there over the weekend.  Very crowded but that's ok cause we were there to have fun and people watch.  Beachy kind of atmosphere - a little corny but hey, this is a fun place so I don't take it too seriously.  Margaritas were good.  Bartender was hot.  Food was ok, but hey it's bar food so I didn't expect great.  Good place to hang out and drink.
