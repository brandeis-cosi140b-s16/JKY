I was here for the first time on Monday. I heard lots of good things about this place. The food was excellent, the service was great, and the atmosphere of the 80s is unbelievable. 

I am given it a 3 star because when we first arrive, the hostess told us that there was a 25 minutes wait (it's a good sign that they are busy, I thought), however, when we were seated, I saw and counted 18 tables empty. For that reason alone I gave  it a 3 star.
