My family and I went here for dinner after watching a show.  We were pretty excited to eat here since we're fans of Top Chef.  We started off with their excellent guacamole. It was creamy and fresh. For our entrees, we got beef brisket taquitos, steak tacos and sauteed shrimp which were great. The meat was tender, juicy and full of flavor. Too bad I got the grilled fish tacos.  The tacos were nicely plated with red, white and green rice.  However, I had fish bones on my tacos and had to send them back 3 times!  By the third time, I still had fish bones and I just gave up on my entree.  A girl could only take so much bone swallowing in one night.  They comped my tacos and our desserts which we appreciated: Flourless Chocolate Cake, Tres Leches Cake and another dessert.  They were ok.

It was a disappointing meal.  I felt bad for our server who had to keep sending my plate back to the kitchen.  I'm not a diner who's a PITA and I don't make complaining a habit either but seriously, whoever was in charge of de-boning and filleting fish that night shouldn't be let back in the kitchen.

Border Grill fish tacos? NEVER again!
