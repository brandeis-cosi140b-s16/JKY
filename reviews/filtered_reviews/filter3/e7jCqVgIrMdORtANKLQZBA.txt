I was honestly shocked at how absolutely amazing the food was at Rosita's because it is in the Ghetto (which happens to be less than two miles from my place ha ha).... and I was honestly shocked at how bad the service was. Normally Mexican restaurants have the best service, but man... it was literally a 2 hour dinner only because it was 20 minutes in between times where we saw our waitress and it took FOREVER to get the food even though they were not that busy. 

I had the Mexican eggs with beans.. DELISH. I was eating slow waiting for my delayed tortilla to arrive and I was over halfway done when it finally got there. I must say, a warm, fresh tortilla makes everything better! 

Honestly, the food was really, really good and if it we-rent for the REALLY bad service I would have given this place at least a four... maybe a five.
