Located in a smaller shopping center in the lake mead area adjoining a bakery, you'll find mama marias.

Service was slow and disjointed.  Very small place so this probably is the main reason for this.  Grabbed my own menu and sat down.

After the waitress stopped by I was served good home made salsas and chips, as well as guacamole.  Salsa had a little kick but was what I'd define as mild overall,  still very good.  Asked for some hot stuff, it never showed up.  

Ordered fajitas for my meal.  Overall not bad, spiced up with peppers, lacked any significant flavor otherwise,  plenty of vegetables.  Not overly greasy.

The tab....very small.  This place is cheap.

Overall, a small family restaurant that's not bad but nothing I'd seek out.  If I'm driving through I'd stop by again.
