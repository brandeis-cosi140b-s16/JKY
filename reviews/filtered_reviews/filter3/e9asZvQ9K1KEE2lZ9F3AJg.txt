Went here with Tori on Sunday and we had a really good time. The restauraunt surrounds a duck pond and we are both big duck fans so we sat outside and the ambiance was great. This is the perfect spot for wedding or work parties. The patios are huge. The food was ok, we just split the chile verde and it was spicy and the pork was really tender. We also had sangria and although a bit sweet for my tastes it was still pretty good.
