I agree that Juans is good but its not the best Mexican food I have ever had. What makes or breaks a Mexican restuarant for me is the chip and salsa and I thought the chips and salsa were average at Juans.
I had the combo #15 which is a cheese enchilada and a beef or chicken taco w rice and beans. The refried beans were the best part, they are super tasty. The price is right and the portions are big.
