I frequently come here for breakfast (although I have to admit there are few Mexican places to choose from in this area of AZ) The good: The chorizo and eggs are always very good. The huevos rancheros with red sauce is excellent. The carne asada burrito is ok. Now the bad: I'm not a fan of the green chili here sorry NMG. Im not a fan of the huevos rancheros with green sauce. I tried the green pork chili burrito and was not a fan either. Maybe it was the time of day but the meat was really chewy and I didn't like the texture. There are some very good items and not so good according to my taste buds. My suggestion: try them all until you find something you like, don't pass on the place due to one dish you didn't like.
