Really pissed about the new sissy sized dip trays, they are the stupidest dishes I've ever seen at a restaurant.  The chip doesn't fit WTF were they thinking? Don't even bring the dam chips if your going to be so cheap. I think they lost a table full of regulars!
Saved by our excellent server, Will he brought us grownup sized bowls!
