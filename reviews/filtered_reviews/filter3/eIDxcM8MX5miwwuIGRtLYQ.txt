I really do love this place, as it is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the Valley (we live in Scottsdale and make the drive frequently). 
The atmosphere is amazing and very festive during the Holidays. 
My absolute favorite on the menu is the Squash Blossom Soup which is seasonal and delish! The flying saucer is killer as well as the Carne Asada Platter. Salads are ok, but I wouldn't bother when there is so much great food to eat here.
I wish they had fountain soft drinks (because they are yummier) but their's are bottled (plastic bottles)...but then again, there's always a yummy margarita to be had! 
Tia Rosa is a Valley favorite and a really good restaurant!
