I've been to Lindo Michoacan West twice now on busy evenings, and there are some positives and negatives to the joint. 

First the service. Our waiters, bartenders and bussers were all very friendly and very "johnny on the spot" with drinks, Margaritas, chips, etc. Both visits I was with a large group of 6+ and we were all well taken care of. I was very pleased with the service and going off that alone, they would earn an additional star. 

Next the drinks. Yum, and strong! I have a very specific favorite margarita that they made to perfection each time. Nothing worse than inconsistent custom drinks, but they passed the test. 

The food. Eh. I'd say that like other Yelpers, I agree that it's just average. The menu is extensive, but nothing in particular jumped out at me. The soup served at dinner was surprisingly good. Chips are fresh and the bean dip is good. Salsa was OK, but kind of average. 

The only other negative was the mariachi band. While their performance was great, it was loud. Very loud. We could barely hear each other and their set was kind of long so that was definitely a negative. 

We will be back. This is a group favorite. I just need to find my special menu item that they do well and I like. Maybe next time I'll try the carnitas. That seems to be a Yelper favorite.
