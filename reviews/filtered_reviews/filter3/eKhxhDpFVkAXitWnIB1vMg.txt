We had lunch with a small group.  Service was prompt and courteous and the patio is very nice.   Pricing was very reasonable.  
The food was just 'average' compared to other nearby competitors.   The Carne Asada taco didnt sti well with me, but the pork tacos were pretty decent.   Other people in the group commented that the shrimp tacos  tasted a little 'off the shelf.'   Overall this one wont be a frequent lunch haunt, but I'll go back sometime Im sure.
