Chipotle is my favorite option for a quick meal. It's often my go-to choice when traveling because it's quick, good and relatively healthy. So I've been to many locations nationwide and you could say I am a big Chipotle fan. 

Unfortunately, this location is the one closest to my home and it is the worst I've ever been to. They are wildly inconsistent. They tend to be pretty busy and I think they try to skimp on portion sizes do they don't run out as fast. One day you have to pay for extra meat to get the same amount of meat you got on another day. And you pretty much always have to pay for extra meat to get what the normal portion is at other locations. With extra steak now being nearly $3, this is straight up ripping off the customers. If you're going to offer a double meat option and place a 40% upcharge on it, you better consistently define those portion sizes.

Some of the staff are quite polite and friendly while others are rude. This is pretty standard for fast food or fast casual establishments who employ young people for low wages so I wouldn't judge them on that. However, I have been there at 11am, when they open, and the line is wrapped around the store and out the door and not one staff member is in sight - all were in the back, apparently getting a pre-shift pep talk (you cound hear the cheer when it ended). Service did not start until 11:12! Some people had left. This is lunch hour and many only have 30 minutes - when you start serving 12 minutes late that's nearly half a person's lunch break.
