One of my reps brought me here for lunch today. We had chips n guac. The guacamole was great, as were the assorted salsas. He recommended the duck tacos. I give the tacos 4 stars.. because I love duck.. and tacos. The combination of the two is genius. Beans and rice were bleh. Not a whole lot of flavor there. Our waitress was kind of a snatch. All in all a good time-
