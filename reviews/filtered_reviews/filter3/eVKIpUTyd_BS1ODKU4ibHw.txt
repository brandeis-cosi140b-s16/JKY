Been here a few times, for some reason a lot of my friends enjoy having their birthdays here.  I do not like waiting in line and there is ALWAYS a line here.  I should stress my main experience here is only on a Friday or Saturday night.  Its always packed in here, and hot as can be.  Hard to move let alone dance.  Often tough to get to the bar and order a drink because there are so many people posted up there.  Not my favorite place, there are generally fun good looking people but at the price of standing like cattle.  Drinks are decent and well priced, but I only go here if I have to.  Just far too crowded for me, too hard to order drinks, hard to dance.  No where to sit down really at night.  I believe there is good seating in the day, but they move all the tables and chairs to make space for more people.
