A-ok authentic Mexican place near the downtown area.

Location - not the best part of town. Parking is the worst especially during busy hours.

Restaurant - came here on a Saturday night and maybe something was wrong with the A/C that night but it was sooo hot! Add to that a crowded room and you've got yourself an oven! 

Service - fast and attentive enough considering how busy they were that night.

Food - we ordered the steak fajitas, wet burrito, and mango margaritas. Chips and salsa and bean dip are served before the main meals. Overall food was good! Definitely what you would expect from a Mexican place - greasy and unhealthy but very satisfying. I could've easily shared my fajitas, but since we had a Groupon, we went ahead and redeemed what it was good for. Margaritas were a bit strong. We didn't finish them. 

Overall- I would recommend this  for an authentic Mexican meal if you're on this side of town. I just hope in my next visit, they've got the a/c fixed by then.
