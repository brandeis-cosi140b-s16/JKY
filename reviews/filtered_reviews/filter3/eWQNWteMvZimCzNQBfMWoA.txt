Let me start by warning you it's VERY over priced. LOL. 1 taco is at least $5.50 I think. Food is kinda hit or mess. We had the cochinita taco, not bad but salty. The carnitas was WAY better. I believe that one is their best seller. We also shared the golden pigs. I was skeptical about eating a fried pork bun but it went really well with the condensed milk sauce. The other dish we tried was the dan dan mian. This dish was the most disappointing to me. The portion is pretty small, I didn't like the flavor and it was way too salty! We sat outside the restaurant and service was pretty good. They refilled water and kept checking on us and clearing plates. Not sure I would go back for the food though. Too pricey and not tasty enough when I feel like I can get better tacos and dim sum in Cali for way cheaper.
