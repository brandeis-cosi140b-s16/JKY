The Jade Red Chicken and Jerk Chicken Fried Rice were both really strong.  After all the hype I had heard about it, I was kind of disappointed to be honest.  It was still enjoyable to find the culinary mixes of Chinese and Mexican, but I fault the people who hyped it up more than the restaurant itself.  Definitely worth checking out, and I'll go there again.
