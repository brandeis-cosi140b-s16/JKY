The food was a respectable combination of value and taste. While I wasn't personally blown away by it, I did find our waitress Christina was particularly attentive and considerate. She made sure we were well taken care of from start to finish, and had a very energetic, optimistic attitude that was quite contagious. 

I find the atmosphere and the decor inviting, everything from the semblance of rope around the booths, art with various bulls and Mexican cultural emblems, and cool lighting. I would say that the place definitely did look the part, and had the staff to more than accommodate the venue.

I had a steak burrito that had a fantastic sauce, but I didn't think it did anything unusually spectacular for me.

This place is a good, consistent spot that I think delivers what you might expect from an upscale, casual dining Mexican restaurant on the sidelines of a casino.

Our server Christina even gave me a spontaneous turbo massage so that I would remember to give a review. I might be a tough critic, but the review has been delivered. 5* waitress 5* atmosphere 5* staff 4* value (given Vegas standards which tend to be pricey), and 3 1/2* food. It fits a role, and fits it well.
