Update.... They no longer carry the ahi stack or the ahi. :-((( this one was of the top three meals I've had in Phoenix (native) and I am bummed. I've never had anything else there because I couldn't abandon that dish. They cut the menu in about half ;(. The service was still great and so was the prickly pea margarita, but my salad was horrible. I couldn't eat more than a few bites because I was gagging. It had those crunchy peas they have in certain trail mixes that might appeal to some but to me it was like dirt. The weird dry mushy pinto beans at the bottom didn't help. I will come back for drinks and nachos but the ahi made this place.
