The tacos are delicious! 

My favorite is the Carnitas - braised baby pig and spicy salsa verde w/ pork rinds!!! The Barbacoa de Res was pretty good too. 

The Langosta (lobster) taco's were OK. I don't think it was worth it for the price. 

The tacos are the size of Mexican street tacos so order a few to taste. 

The Beijing Glass noodles is a yummy cold noodle dish w/ veggies. I found it refreshing. The avocados on top were a good mix. 

I also had the Har Gau dumplings. The outside of the dumpling was good, dumplings must be freshly made, but I thought the inside could use a little more taste. 

Overall, this is a pretty good place for higher end China/Mex. It's tough to find a China Mex restaurant anyway.
