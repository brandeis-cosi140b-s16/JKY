Counter people need to know what they are serving. Three different people were clueless when I popped the "white chicken " question. Finally, they said it was white meat, but a chicken burrito at this place only contains chicken in a tortilla for 4 bucks. Nothing else is inside - that is not a burrito in my mind. I ended up with the egg, onion and potato breakfast burro, which was small, but pretty good. Everything was well cooked and it wasn't as huge as some other places breakfast burros. The hot sauce was watery and had no taste, but the mild was better with more flavor and still a small bite. Chips are not included to-go. This is some sort of americanized mexican food despite what they tell you on website. Might be back for breakfast again, which is great that is served all day.
