Pretty good.  5 of us decided to try it out.  Sara said her margarita was something to yelp about, so I am.

I had the quesadilla, it was stuffed with veggies but was really messy to eat.  It kept falling apart.  Gary had the meatloaf, he dug his mashed potatoes but said the meatloaf was too spicy.   Emily had a wrap type appetizer.  She really liked hers, and had leftovers.  I never have leftovers, I have a Gary! ha!  Kathy had salad with shrimp, and she ate it all, so it must of been good. 

The cheese tortillas were fantastic! Apparently they have 12 different tortilla flavors. For dessert we had almond flan with berries, SO GOOD!  More please!  And a chocolate cake, I didn't try any of it but it disappeared so it must of been good!

The patio was nice but it's summer in Phoenix so we ate inside.  I don't know if I would go here again.  It might make it's way into my rotation.  Maybe for a drink on the patio in the winter.
