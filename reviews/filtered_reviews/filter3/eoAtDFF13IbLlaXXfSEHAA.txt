The food was really good. Especially the carnitas enchilada. Chips are good and fresh. I have to give three stars because the server waited twenty minutes to take our food order after we waited a long time for drinks already. Then the food took forever when there were only three tables in service!! Forever as in longer than thirty minutes, so while I don't usually eat the chips I didn't have a choice. The chef is very attentive to your allergies I must add. Eat here on a day when you are on serious chill. Oh yeah -- great top shelf margaritas!!!!
