This place was recommended by one of my friend's friend.  The moment I entered this place, I noticed this was unique for me because everything is all outdoor.  As a person from the San Francisco Bay Area, we don't have places like this because of the weather.  There were heated lights, but I believe that's unnecessary especially with the warm Arizona nights approaching.   Maybe for the Winter season. 

The food was very good.  We started with chips and salsa and their nachos.  The salsa was full of flavor and they taste a lot better than Salty Senorita.  My wife and I ordered the the six pack Dos XX fish tacos and they were very good, which you can't go wrong because its just beer battered fish.  They definitely taste a lot better than Rubios that's for sure.    

They have live music Friday night and a huge Jenga block for anyone who wants to play.  

The waitstaff was friendly and they checked back at us here and there.  This place is definitely leaning towards a younger crowd, but it's a fun place to be.  Dos Gringos is a nice place for lunch and is great if you have a large group for dinner and drinks.  However, I do not recommend this place if you have young children because some of the signage that is posted on the wall and below the bar counters.  Some of the signage is inappropriate for young kids to read. 

The prices are moderate, which is usually just right for Tex-Mex.  Furthermore, the drinks are inexpensive and you can play Jenga.  If you're in Scottsdale, then I recommend this place especially you have a group of friends with you.   You can't go wrong.
