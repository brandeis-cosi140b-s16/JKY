I got to try this last Friday about 8:30pm (didn't realize they close at 9pm).

The food was above average, and the prices are low, but the atmosphere is woefully out of date and dilapidated. 

I appreciate the longevity and family-run aspects, but come on guys it's time for a remodel (at least some fresh paint and better lighting). A few booths would be a huge upgrade from the wobbly tables, and I'm also not a huge fan of paper plates...

This would be a better choice for a quick lunch on the cheap, or take out.
