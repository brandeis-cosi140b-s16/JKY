Okay, so I have to say that I expected subpar generic Mexican food. However, I was happily surprised to find that there were some authentic Mexican dishes. I was also very happy with the extra spicy salsa that was given to me after I requested something hotter than the normal salsa that they give to all tables. Good salsa provides the basis for all good Mexican food in my book. Most of the other food was average American / Mexican, but with half price draft beers, appetizers, and margaritas during happy hour who can complain? Their desserts were also pretty good. I guess I would say it's better than Mad Max but not as good as Los  Cabos or Verde .
