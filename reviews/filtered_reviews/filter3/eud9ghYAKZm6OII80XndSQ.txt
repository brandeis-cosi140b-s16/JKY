I travel a lot and like going to the Barrio's Cafe in the Phoenix airport.  Problem is... my advocacy is loosing momentum with each visit due to the servers spending more time complaining about their job and co-workers than paying attention to creating a vibe worthy of repeat. Please get back on track.
