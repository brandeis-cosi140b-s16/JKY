wow this place is LOUD haha, I felt like I had to scream to be heard. food is good but the portions seem kinda small for the price. I got the carne asada tacos and my bf got a burrito. he was pretty satisfied with his burrito because it was very meaty-- a lot of places tend to pack a lot of rice and beans. my tacos were yummy as well although I wish they were bigger!! I enjoyed my dinner but I don't think it's that delicious enough to come back, I've experienced better mexican food for a better price. it was a good one-time experience for Vegas I would say.
