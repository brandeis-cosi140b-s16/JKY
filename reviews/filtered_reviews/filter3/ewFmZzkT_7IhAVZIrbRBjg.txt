I typically love coming here, as it has some of the best mex food, for a great price. Any other day I'd give 5 stars. 

...That was, until just this last visit.  
The service and quality absolutely lacked.
First off, They got my order wrong! Thankfully, they refunded me the extra burrito and gave me the drink i originally ordered instead. The cashier had a sketchy demeanor to him and seemed kinda out of it, maybe he was on something? Idk.
I digress, I arrive home and open my food container only to see that they even messed up my "no guac" request! Is this cashier deaf?! Lol.
To make things better, I bite in to my food to find another little extra; a toothpick.

I typically don't review stuff, but this trip literally compelled me to go out of my way to get on yelp and express what happened. The place is great, but tonight sucked. 

2 stars; but because the food is so great, 3.
