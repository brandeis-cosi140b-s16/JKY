Had the taco salad, it was so so.  Not enough green chili meat and a chewy taco shell but overall it had a good flavor.  I was wanting to love this place because of all the good reviews!? Kids liked their tacos.  Had to pay for water, no fountain drinks here.  But to their credit I do have to say they were very friendly and I'll give it another try!
