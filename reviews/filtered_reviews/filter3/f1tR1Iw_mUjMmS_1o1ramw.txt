There are two locations. The other location is closed on Sunday! Complimentary nachos with guacamole and salsa. 

We tried the fusion nachos and the fusion burrito. The fusion nachos were surprisingly good! The bulgogi is tender and tasty. There's also salsa and jalape√±os on the nachos.

I wasn't that impressed with the fusion burrito. I wasn't into the salad part of the burrito. The bulgogi and rice and salsa and the veggie flavors didn't really jive well together. 

Service is good though! Waitress and waiter both very friendly.
