Overall a decent meal. My wife had spinach enchiladas and enjoyed them. She said the rice was way too salty but the rest was good. I had steak fajitas. The steak was seasoned to perfection and was very tender. The beans were good and there was a nice accompaniment of veggies and condiments. The staff was very friendly and fast. 
My only complaint is that of many other reviews, the food was good but not special enough to substantiate the cost. Our meal came to $65 and this was with no drinks.
