Stopped in for an early dinner. The host was polite and seated us immediately. The waiter seemed uninterested greeted us and went through the motions but didn't appear to want to be there. The food was out of this world. I am not usually a big fan of Mexican food however the chicken tacos were awesome. They came with a side of refried beans and rice both were adequate but the chicken tacos were the star of the dish.  All other Mexican restaurants I have eaten at offer complementary chips & salsa this place doesn't. The salsa is good and labeled appropriate for heat level. The chips were good. The soft taco shells were awesome. I can't speak for the drinks however my associate who had a margarita said it was very good. Would eat there again.
