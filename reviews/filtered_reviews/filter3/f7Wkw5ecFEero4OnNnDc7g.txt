It's cheap, the margaritas are huge, they serve breakfast tacos all day (proper breakfast tacos, not Taco Bell's waffle nonsense), and you can sit on the patio with a giant drink and a plate of breakfast tacos, feeling vaguely like an expatriate who ought to be listening to Mexican radio. It's the next best thing to being in Tijuana eating barbecued iguana. (I can't swear there isn't an iguana taco -- have another 'rita and go take a look, 'kay?)

It's a "scene" restaurant, as most things on Mill Avenue are, so not the thing if you're feeling incapable of coping with sudden, loud noises, many of them made by inebriated undergraduates. If you go at a dead-ish time of day, it's not in-your-face loud. The staff are perky and patient while you figure out the menu for the first time, and they don't go nuts over trying to turn tables if there isn't a crowd. This is counter service -- order up front, pick up the food in the back when called -- so it's pretty low key.

The breakfast tacos are pleasant, more than life-changing. If you have a serious problem with fairly well-done scrambled eggs, ask up front to have them runnier or order something else, as these are quite well-done eggs. In the future, I would stick to variations where there's something greasy like chorizo to counter the stiffness of the eggs. These tacos are very generous -- I thought I was starving and couldn't finish a plate of two with the accompanying Latin potatoes (which are very nice) and refried beans (which are generic).

As far as Mexican restaurants of this sort -- silly name, self-conciously funky decor, waitresses in tight shirts, very large drinks, loud music, okay food -- go, this is a bargain with a nice view of the neighborhood.
