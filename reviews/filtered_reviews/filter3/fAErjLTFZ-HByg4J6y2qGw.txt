Ok, I am a chips and salsa fanatic! This place has the best chips!! I was the chip monster!! Munch, munch, munch...! The drinks were ok. I ordered the Mojito and it was alright. We then stuck to the Pom-Acai Margarita after that. That was way more tastier....

The decor was very beachy...., the sand outside was cool! The actual look of this place was very nice....I definitely would come back but not when its sooo packed. 

I have to come back for the chips........!
