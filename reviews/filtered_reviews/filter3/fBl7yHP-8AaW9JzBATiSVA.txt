Joyride Taco House includes all of the wonderfully trendy requisites that those familiar with Upward Projects concepts are accustomed to: contemporary interior, big-indie playlist, hipstaff with an accommodating if occasionally tepid disposition,  and cheery bathroom displays of branded toilet paper.  It's owners' predecessors are much more subdued and earthy in character; Joyride is borderline frenetic by comparison, and I mean that in a good way: it's all bright colors and motley decor and 'we're blasting our decent taste in music on purpose you damn suburbanites so don't bring the babes if you're going to be uptight about it.'

After scoping the decidedly mixed taco reviews (we Phoenicians are a notoriously cheap lot, aren't we?) I opted for the Cosmic Torta (veggie sandwich).  Too many mealy textures more appropriate in a burrito (squash beans salsa etc.) made for a mouth-feel that was muddy as hell, (which I really should have anticipated, by the way.)  The bread was perfectly tender and the presence of avocado improves pretty much anything, but overall big thumbs meh: that bite needs reworking.  The cocktails were the type of cloyingly saccharine deliciousness that you can't stop from ordering even though you know they're going to roil ceaselessly in your stomach later on.  I had a Mazatlan Mule and two Blood Orange Margaritas - so much delightfully tooth-aching tastiness going on, enough to +1 in terms of stars.

Not the best of the UP lot.  That said, still better than 95% of the restaurants in the god awful locale that is Gilbert.  A must try if you're within a ten mile radius.
