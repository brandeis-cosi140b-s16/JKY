Nothing wrong here.  It's more elegant than a typical Mexican restaurant.  I found the food perfectly edible and hits the spot when I have a craving for Mexican but I save 4 and 5 star reviews for Mexican restaurants when they are truly a cut above.  Usually the best Mexican food is found on plastic plates in divey locations.

Go here for perfectly good Mexican food but you won't be blown away.  Also I didn't like their margaritas.
