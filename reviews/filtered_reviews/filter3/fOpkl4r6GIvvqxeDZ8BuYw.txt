First and last trip to new location.  Food was 4 star worthy.  Service (once seated) and wait staff excellent. However, new location is loud, open, more bar-ish, and LOUD. 

We had reservations, showed up on time, and then waited 25 min to be seated.  Had we been told that they don't really do reservations we would have gone someplace else. Had we known it was going to be this loud we would have gone somewhere else. We wanted a nice date night.  Had we wanted club level sounds we would have gone to a club. 

Loved the old location on East Blvd.  Was good ambiance, food and service.  We never had to wait when we made reservations.  

We will miss you Cantina 1511.
