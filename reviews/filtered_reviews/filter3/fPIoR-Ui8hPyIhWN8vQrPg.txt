El Segundo Sol is a new Mexican restaurant that just opened up this week at the Fashion Show Mall (it's located in the old cafe babareeba location).  I visited the restaurant on Friday night and left pretty pleased.  Notwithstanding the "new opening" hiccups that our party experienced, I recommend that you check this place out!

Minus one star for not providing chips and salsa (you can purchase it for around 3 dollars but the salsas are nothing to write home about...they're all pretty bland).  However, if you're with a group, try the queso dip, it is amazing!!  It comes with small, in-house made corn tortillas.  So yum!

The drink selection is great.  I had a tableside margarita on the rocks and I was able to select my choice of tequila.  The server also had no problems customizing margarita orders.  And they offer a great and long selection of beers on tap.

On to the food!  I ordered the tacos al pastor and they were delicious!  The shredded pork arrived in a little covered black pot alongside rice, black beans and guacamole/sour cream.  And it was served with more of the homemade corn tortillas.  So, it became a make your own tacos platter.  I highly recommend ordering the al pastor.  A friend ordered the chicken enchiladas and they were wonderful!  I didn't try the carne asada entree but it arrived on an enormous plate and looked fantastic.  One side note: the rice is a little odd for a Mexican restaurant...it had an aroma almost like jasmine rice and it was very sticky like short grain rice.  It tasted alright, it just took some getting used to.

Minus one more star for the prices.  They're pretty steep compared to other Mexican restaurants I've frequented, but then again, the restaurant's located on the strip so it's understandable.  The decor is great, especially if you sit outside under the trees (strung with twinkle lights!).  If you're craving Mexican, try this place out.
