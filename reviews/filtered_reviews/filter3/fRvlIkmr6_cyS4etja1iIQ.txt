went over the weekend for a friends birthday....

  the restaurant was so dark i could barely read my menu, but the service was amazing, i never had to ask for a refill and it seemed like there was a constant flow of chips and really good salsa, i doubt it was made in house

i ordered a carne asada quesadilla....whatever was inside my quesadilla was not carne asada.  it was very bland, no marinade to differentiate mexican food from what i could make at home let alone even any salt and pepper and unfortunately my steak was really fatty and chewy...

it was edible, but nowhere near the $20 i paid for it.  gotta love vegas!  if you want amazing mexican food, go to the border grill in mandalay bay...my friends and i werent willing to travel that far and we were in the mood to try something new....the guacamole was really good, but i doubt they made that fresh...cool restaurant to look around in, maybe just go and have chips, salsa, guac and a margarita....go spend your money gambling if youre just gonna throw it away ;)
