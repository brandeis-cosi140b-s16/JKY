We loved the atmosphere upon walking in and were given a great table outside. But, the good stuff ended there. Our waitress was extremely nice but not at all efficient. I had to ask numerous times to get water and our third margarita showed up after we had asked for the check. The dinner took forever to arrive and when it did, my carne asada tacos were very dry. No one in our party would go back for the food or bad service but the atmosphere was cool. Would go back for a cocktail and chips.
