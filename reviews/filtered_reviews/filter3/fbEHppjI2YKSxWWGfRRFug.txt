Went based on reviews. Ordered a margarita and was asked if I wanted it plain or strawberry (wasn't told strawberry would be extra). The margarita looked better then it tasted. Ordered the imperial shrimp and 2 orders of the taco plate. Shrimp was delicious and tacos took over an hour to come out. Finally received our tacos but it was not what we ordered :( 20 minutes later and our tacos were finally here! Server gave me a free drink for messing up on our order. Tacos were ok, it was a Monday so locals get 50% off the entire bill. Probably wouldn't go back to pay full price. I'd rather go to Pepe's
