This place was pretty decent.  The tacos are definitely just like the ones we had in Mexico, with the exception that the meat was pretty hard.  The potatoes, on the other hand are amazing.  They don't really go with the rest of the menu which is very inexpensive.  The potatoes are like 6 bucks, but honestly, they are worth it.

I probably would go back.  The food is okay, the atmosphere is friendly and a very nice staff.  

If you go, get the potatoes.
