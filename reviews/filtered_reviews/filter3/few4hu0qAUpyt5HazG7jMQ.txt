I keep coming back here because I love Mexican and it it so close to where I live, but I never leave here completely satisfied.  The food is good but not always seasoned properly.  The pastor and carnitas have not been as flavorful as I would expect and the barboaca was way too salty the one time I got it.  The wait staff is friendly but seems to rush you out and can be forgetful at times. The layout is unique with a bar/lounge area and also has a front porch seating for when its nice out.  This is one of the best spots for Mexican I know of in Charlotte. However, I prefer their sister restaurant Paco's Tacos as far as the food goes. The salsa verde at both restaurants is banging!
