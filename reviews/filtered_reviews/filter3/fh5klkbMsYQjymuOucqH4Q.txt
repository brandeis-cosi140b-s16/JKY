Go here for food only.  Drinks are way over-priced for what they are. For example, they want you to pay $7 for a half pint glass of very weak Margaritas.  $7 should have you feeling pretty decent after 1 and these were as if I didn't have anything.  I have a little breathalyzer for fun and I blew after one and it did not register.  

As for food, definitely a great place and good flavor.  They are, however, inconsistent on portion size and ingredients. For example, one time I ordered the carne Asada burrito and half of it was beans.  The next time, no beans and lots of carne asada.  

In summary, Gallo Blanco is kinda like a box of chocolates with their food, you never know what you're gonna get.  


As for drinks, go elsewhere.  Even happy hour makes me sad.
