Phoenix has more than enough places to eat Mexican food every single day of the year but I had being wanted to try out Taco Guild with a friend for some time. We finally went and like so many others, I have to give it a 5 for the atmosphere and the building. It's unlike any place I've ever eaten at to be honest. But...for the rest it's a big "meh". There little tacitos are similar to what you find at nearby Joy Ride which I found to be very close in terms of coolness but with tastier tacos. 
I took a dive into what I thought was some creamy avocado and it though it wasn't something that set my pallet on fire it was later confirmed by our waiter prior to ordering that the avocado sauce was with jalapenos...now that I could believe. 
As for the important thing, the food, I went for the "safe" chicken tacos but there was just something lacking. Not as tender as flavorful and the tacos felt a little too thick. I'll be honest that I'm all for mild tasting salsa and it would have been nice for the waiter to warn that the dipping sauces provided (they are all good and probably perfect for most) are on the spicy side. It also didn't help that there were flies in the restaurant. Not the most enjoyable thing.

I would recommend the place for a drink and happy hour for sure but I'm not honestly sure I'd be back for lunch or dinner. Worth checking out and hopefully having a higher opinion of it then me, amazing decor aside.
