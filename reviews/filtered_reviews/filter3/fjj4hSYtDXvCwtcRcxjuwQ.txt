Came in on a Saturday evening and it was pretty empty except two other folks besides my boyfriend and his parents. We got an order of carne Asada fries. I've definitely have had better in San Diego and LA. The fries were perhaps the best part of the meal because the entr√©e was loaded with sticky cheeses that harden easily and  meat tasted a little too burn and a little bit of refried beans (no even 1 tablespoons of it) at the bottom of the plate. The presentation really needs some work... the side of these Styrofoam plate was dirty with food, not sure if it was ours.

Overall I would not go back but its an ok place to eat at.
