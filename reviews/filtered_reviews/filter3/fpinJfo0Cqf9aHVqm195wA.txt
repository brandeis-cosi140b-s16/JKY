A little pricey considering all the other Mexican options out there.  Even with a BOGO coupon two burritos and a drink come to almost $14 !!  $2.19 for a drink seems a bit much.  They seemed slow and the workers not really attentive.  They half listen to you and mess up the order.  I think the team needs to work on service.  I also was a little ticked off that the whole time I was there they ran a blender - for like 15 minutes straight.  Seriously do the food prep before rush hour.  I am also offended by the up charge tactic of this chain.  Charging $1 extra for wet is fine, but the print is really small on the menu and when they ask if you want wet they never tell you it costs an extra buck per.
