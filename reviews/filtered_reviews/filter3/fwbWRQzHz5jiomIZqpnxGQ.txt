I came here around 9pm this past Thursday night. I was annoyed because after waiting 45 minutes, the hostess said we would be seated in a few minutes, but she forgot about us. After another 15 minutes, we went back again to the desk after seeing other parties seated ahead of us, and they realized they forgot and quickly sat us at a table inside that was empty for the entire time we were standing there. Hungry and frustrated after 1 hour, I'm docking them 1 star.

Once we were seated, the food was great. The elote corn was really good, it was this sweet cream butter (tasted almost like caramel) on top of the cob, cut in half. The crispy pork with cola lime glaze was also really good- little pieces of juicy pork, sweet with a nice smear of this nutty paste inside a lettuce wrap. These were the 2 best dishes I would get again.

The guacamole was pretty standard, they put garlic, lemon, tomatoes, onions, cilantro and some cheese on top. They only use one avocado, for $12 I didn't think it was worth it. The mission fries were skinny fries served with two sauces- we couldn't finish this, but they were good fries and filling.

I'll probably come back for the food, but hope the front desk service improves or they start taking reservations.
