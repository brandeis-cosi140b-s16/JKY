The food here is actually very good. The girlfriend and I had carnitas and carne asada tacos. Both were really delicious and authentic...the carne asada in particular was very very good. Really tender and well marinated. 

Only downsides are really slow, inattentive service and obviously it's way overpriced (but that's expected in Vegas)
