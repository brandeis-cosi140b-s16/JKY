What can you say about airport eateries that hasn't already been said...about most cars made in the 1990's. Non are really "that bad" but you never really want to take your date in one. Most try hard, but none really tend to hit that 4th star.
This review is more for the staff here at the Jose Cuervo Tequileria..but the food deserves honorable mention as well. I was here waiting for a flight home last week and my partner and I needed a sit down meal pretty badly. We found two of the few open seats here in the eatery and grabbed them... however on the way in we were spying a few seats in the "outside" area...only to hear the waitress comment to us that we "shouldn't sit down and expect quick service" as she "couldn't handle the tables" she "already had". Not a good omen...but we ventured forward grabbing a small table inside.
Now yes...the place was packed, but the waitress that we had greeted us fairly quickly, indeed mentioning that she were very busy but she would get us some drinks and food as fast as possible. I also overheard a woman sitting at the table next to us complaining to several staff, and patrons that walked in...about the service, the manager etc..even instructing people walking by to "please not eat here".  The waitress that she spoke to also happened to be helping us....and I must say the waitress handled it well.
Yes, out food and drinks took a bit longer than we perhaps should have...the food wasn't 5 star... but I gotta say the nachos we both had were exactly what was needed. And the beer was cold.
