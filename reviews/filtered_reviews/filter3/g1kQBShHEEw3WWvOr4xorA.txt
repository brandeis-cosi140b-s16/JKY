Carlsbat Cavern, or rather, Carlsbad Tavern, is a campy New Mexcian restaurant/bar that was the "ethnic" concession made to me by my parents after pleading to go to at least one regionally appropriate restaurant during my visit.

What do I mean by campy, you ask?
- Stuffed animal bats on the ceiling. As G.O.B. from AD would say, "Come on!"
- Newspaper menus headlined "The Daily Guano"
- Bat sauce: a Habanero-based hot sauce that was mild considering the base
- A cave-themed interior, a bar area, and a decorative pool/moat exterior

After I assisted my sheltered family in translating the "unfamiliar" menu, we consumed:
- Nachos (~$6 on HH, normally ~$9): Chips were a bit light for the heaping toppings
- Lobster Enchiladas (~$16): Disappointing - slightly bitter and not much taste overall
- Chile Rellenos (~$11): Peppers stuffed with pork and cheese, tasty but a bit heavy
- Green Chile Mac + Cheese (~$6): Standard with appreciably subtle pepper flavor
- Chocolate Mousse Cake ($7): Too much cake and too much sugar, not enough cocoa
- Chocolate Eruption ($7): A "cake" with hardened chocolate mousse and cheesecake chunks; better than the aforementioned but still overly sweet

On happy hour, for a meal made of discounted appetizers and ~$4 margaritas, I could see this being a fun choice, but skip dinner (even though admittedly I am compelled by the ample outdoor moatside seating and the Habanero burger replete with medical warnings.) While I don't feel I wasted my restaurant selection, I also don't feel I prospected and struck pay dirt in Carlsbad Tavern either and I'm sure gold is out there.
