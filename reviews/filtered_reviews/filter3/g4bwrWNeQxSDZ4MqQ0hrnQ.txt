Bummer. I was pretty disappointed with this place considering it's 200+ reviews and 4-star rating. It's ALMOST there but there's just something not quite right... and I think its the service. From the hostess to the bartender and server - everyone was very slow and seemed VERY inexperienced. At the bar and our table we waited more than five minutes before we were acknowledged and then it was another 15 before we got drinks or water (which we had to ask for again). No bueno. The vibe is okay but didn't have me jumping for joy. There are plenty of cool, hip Mexican restaurants in Phoenix and I won't be running back here expect for maybe a happy hour after work and some small bites. The food as dinner wasn't worth the $70 price tag. 

We had the "famous" guacamole - okay, it was good with the mango bites, but any bite without a mango was really bland.. basically squished avocado. We did the ceviche - fresh but nothing spectacular. One of each taco... the best was absolutely the carne asada.
