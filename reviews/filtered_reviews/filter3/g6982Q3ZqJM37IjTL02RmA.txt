Atmosphere:  LOUD!!!!  Come prepared to talk loudly and listen hard!  The waitress did an excellent job attending to us and keeping us happy even while they were very busy.  Fun vibe and atmosphere - great hangout spot for the weekends.  

Drinks:  Sangria is delicious but sweet.  You can get margaritas by the pitcher - and they are strong!!

Food:  Chips and Guacamole was pretty good - strong on the lime/citrus flavor, but in a good way.  Tacos!!!....$4 tacos!!  We had the Short Ribs, Fish, Pastor, Pollo Rojo and Huitlacoche Tacos and we liked them in that order.
