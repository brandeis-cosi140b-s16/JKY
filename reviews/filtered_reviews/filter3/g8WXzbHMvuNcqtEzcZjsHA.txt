It was pretty good. I would like to see them use a diffrent bun for there burgers. Grocery store bought buns sucked.  They should order them from another local business like great buns, fresh daily,  it kinda took away from the flavor of the HB. Also the hamburgers we order were really over cooked and over seasoned. The mark of an inexperianced cook, remember ground beef only needs to reach.155  degree's for 15 seconds not 15 hrs. I give FAT BOY 3 stars. Given its location the inside of the restaurant is very clean the people are great very friendly.  I will go back. I hope they make some changes. They really should get 3 1/2 stars because all ingredients were fresh except the buns.
