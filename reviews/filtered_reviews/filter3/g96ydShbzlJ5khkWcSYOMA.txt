This restaurant was featured on Check Please Arizona and the reviews were really really awesome on that show. We drove quite a while to get here and the food and ambiance were just mediocre. Nothing like what the people on the show said. 

The Shrimp Fajitas were good and their chips and salsa are really good. The seating is dark antd dingy if you are not in front of the windows. Ask for a booth near the windows. 

We also had the vegetarian fajitas which were okay. The sides are way too much and no one really needs to eat THAT much sour cream. The server we had was a delight and very attentive. 

I will probably not go here again considering it is very far from me and very greasy food. They did let me know that they do not use lard or other animal products to cook their food with including their tortillas, in case you are wondering.
