Expected better after seeing Los Taquitos on DDD. Prices are great, atmosphere is nonexistent. Took 15 minutes to get food after ordering, and although ok, we were underwhelmed. Fish tacos had so much liquid they were soggy, burritoes had to much sauce and fell apart. Rice was pretty tasty. Cost about $32 for family of 5 to eat. Not sure w'll go back. For a little more, On The Border has food we liked more.
