Horrible service! I read about others' bad service but was hoping for a good night. I thought I was invisible. Our order was to go, and half of it was missing, the other half was wrong. The order was ready and waiting and I was in there for a total of 25 minutes, waiting for an ipad?.  The food was not terrible but not worth the wait, inconvenience and missing food. I will never be back and I hope others will reconsider.
