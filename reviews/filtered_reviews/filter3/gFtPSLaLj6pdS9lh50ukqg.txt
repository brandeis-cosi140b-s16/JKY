As much as I love kalua pig, my favorite of the meats turned out to be the huli huli chicken. I had three tacos in the crispy corn shell topped with cabbage, cilantro, and a little cheese. I sample all three sauces but they weren't that great. 

The coconut bark is so ono! They also have Hawaiian Sun drinks and play music by Hawaiians (not "traditional" Hawaiian music), which reminded me of going with my buddy to see her cousin perform with a local band back in Hawaii. Great laid back vibe.

I have no complaints. I gave it a three because I wish that it was more Hawaii and less Hawaii-Mex. Dude, some pancit, sticky rice or Mac salad would have set it off.
