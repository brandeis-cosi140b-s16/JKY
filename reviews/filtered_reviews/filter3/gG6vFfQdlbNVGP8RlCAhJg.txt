I love it when a unique new bar/restaurant opens within walking distance of my house so I was very excited to try this place.  My wife and I finally made the walk last Friday.  We arrived just as happy hour was ending and the place was packed.  They should really call this place "Club Canteen" because I really got the Scottsdale club vibe from the decor, people, music and staff of this place.  Anyway, I didn't let that deter us so we gave the hostess our name to be put on the 45 min waiting list to get a table.

After walking around mill for 20 mins we went back and took a seat at the bar.  The bartender was very nice but the margaritas are just ok.  They do have TONS of tequila choices if that is your thing so they weren't lying about the "tequila bar" in their name.

They gave us a table in the time promised.  We were seated outside in the back and in the dark.  It was kind of ridiculous that there were no lights out there and we could barely see the menu.  Between that and the loud dbag techno music I really felt old.  Anyway, here is what we had:

* chips and guacamole - the chips were great but the guac was too pasty and may have been from some sort of package.  It tasted ok but it wasn't what I expected from a "Mexican" food place.
* steak skewer lettuce wrap things - these were pretty good and unique....little skewers with tender pieces of steak which you slide off into lettuce wraps.
* Corona And Lime Roast Chicken - this was very good and flavorful

The service was just ok.  It was just too busy with drinkers too get decent service.  It was like having dinner at a club.

Anyway, this place seems better than it really is.  It is a great addition to Mill but I probably won't be back.  I would like to try more of their food because the menu online really does look amazing, but it is more trouble than it is worth.
