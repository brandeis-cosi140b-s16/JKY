I guess I'm just spoiled to the authentic Mexican food we have back home in Southern California. But after a long long day of drinking on the Salt River, The group decided to swing by Fiesta Burrito in an effort to feed our beer munchies

Again like all Authentic Mexican places they take cash only, that being said, I had to spot a buddy of mine for his meal. I ordered the rolled taco's w/ guac and a carne asada burrito. I was blown away.....no carne asada fries?? That's a staple back home!!!

The burrito was pretty big and had tons of carne asada packed in there, the rolled taco's had a good amount of guac on em but skimpy on the cheese. Also this did cost a little more than what I'm used to paying back at home. I guess if I need a Mexican fix and I'm out in AZ I'll come back but other than that I'll be glad to go home to Alerto's, Los Alazanes, and Taqueria de Anda for some Carne Asada Fries.
