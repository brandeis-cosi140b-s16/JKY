Casa don Juan is one of my longtime favorite spots. The Lengua tacos are always consistently delicious and entirely craveable. This is a great casual sit down Mexican restaurant great for pre or post First Friday munchies.

The frozen margaritas aren't exactly strong, but they aren't overly sweet either. The atmosphere is warm, exciting, and inviting. It's like Grandma's House in Mexico. Great smiling service, and you can pay at the table or on your way out.
