I came here for a Spanish Meetup and ordered the Vallarta Shrimp and for dessert the Tres Leches cake. The shrimp dish was pretty good but was maybe a little too sweet. The cake on the other hand was way too sweet and otherwise could have tasted very good since I did like the flavor. 

On a more positive note, the establishment is nice and seems pretty upbeat and some of the staff speak Spanish, which is good for practice.

Overall I think this is a good place but the food didn't do it for me. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't spectacular either.
