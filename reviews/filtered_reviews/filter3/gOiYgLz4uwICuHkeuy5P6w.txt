Distrito is pretty good, but not memorable.   It  lacks the energy you would expect given all the hype.   Plus the decor was underwhelming.   Too dark and lounge-like.  Boring really.

We started with guac and chips and salsa.   Chips were way over salted, almost inedible.  But I did eat them, found myself brushing off the loads of salt with my fingers.  Guac and salsa were good.  Then we moved on to veggie tacos which were nice and a kind of mexican flatbread with mushrooms and a huitlacoche sauce.   Also good.  The rice with corn, cream and habeneros, a kind of Mexican risotto could have been good if it weren't so over salted.  

Distrito offers a nice variety of margaritas.  We tried the watermelon- cucumber and the cilanto and both were good.

We had heard that the service can be a nightmare, but we received good, if bland, service.  

So Distrito was an OK choice for us, but we are not pining to return.
