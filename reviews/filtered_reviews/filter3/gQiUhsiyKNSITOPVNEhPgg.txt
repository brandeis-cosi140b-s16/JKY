3.5 STARS

Came with a group of first timers on a Friday night for dinner. No wait and we were able to grab a table in the patio, which looks over the Mandalay pools. The ceiling fans kept it cooler and bearable. But if you hate the heat like I do, I'd stick to a table inside during the summer. 

Reading through the menu, we were all overwhelmed and excited because it all sounded so good! Finally we ordered the following:

- Grilled skirt steak
- Short rib taquitos 
- Tecate carnitas 
- Chocolate cake 
- Sangria

Unfortunately we were all a little disappointed at the end of dinner. Don't get me wrong everything was good but nothing special. I've definitely had better Mexican food.

Service was however amazing! Our waiter was very nice and hilarious! For the most part the food came out in a timely manner. The only thing that took awhile was the dessert. We weren't sure if they forgot about it. This place is great for families too. They provide crayons and paper for children.
