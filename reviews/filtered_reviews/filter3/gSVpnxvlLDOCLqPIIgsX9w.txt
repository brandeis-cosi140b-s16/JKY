Really wanted to love love love this place. The service was great and liked the decor. The food wasn't amazing though. I got the garlic shrimp, which seemed more buttery than garlicky. Husband muscled through his fish tacos. Kiddos didn't want to eat what looked like Costco chicken nuggets.

I did like my giant margarita. The amuse-bouche (ceviche) was phenomenal.
