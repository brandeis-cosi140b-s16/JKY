This place was amazing when it first opened.  We would eat the short rib and chicken tacos 3 times a week.  Unfortunately the quality declined and so did the service.  I called and told the owner about the issues and he didn't seem to care.  I go back every once and awhile to see if it's getting better but I just keep getting different tasting tacos with hard stale tortillas and they don't even give you a lime with the tacos anymore.  I'll give them 3 stars because the burgers are still really good.  Chocolate shake is usually good but sometimes has some freezer burn.
