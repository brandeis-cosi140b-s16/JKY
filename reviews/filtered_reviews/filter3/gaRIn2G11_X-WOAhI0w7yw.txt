We go here sometimes when the boy is craving something homey Mexican. 

It's not my favorite place because I'm not a huge Mexican fan, but boyfriend likes it a lot and claims they have good food for him. I like that they are kind of divey and everyone is nice and accommodating. 

I usually get some Americanized version of Mexican and boyfriend is obsessed with burritos and everything. I can't remember the name of what I had but it's usually chicken with cream cheese. It's pretty good, not great. Boyfriend always clears his plate- clean plate club! 

I like their margaritas and generally like going there for drinks and some apps or something small. We will always go back since oh friend loves it but because I am not a huge Mexican fan I won't go here in my own (nothing against you guys it's just my personal taste).
