A good portion of my last trip to Vegas was spent looking for a taqueria. Where was all of the Mexican food?! This time around I remembered to use Yelp and found this place.

Why three stars? I found the food to be disappointing and lacking. While the rice and beans exceeded my expectations it was the main entrees that didn't cut it for us. 

Parking can be tough if you are coming in the evening during the weekend. Drinks are great and guac is made right in front of you from fresh ingredients like the tradiational Mexican restaurants typically do.

Decor is adorable and service was fine.

My quest for awesome Mexican food in Vegas continues!
