I'm not quite understanding these 5 star reviews....maybe they are friends with the manager or owner. 

It's not that I think this is a poor experience. I agree with most of the comments: "unpretentious" "comfortable" "great ambiance". My visit was all those things --  pleasantly surprising a restaurant found in a hotel. 

The menu is interesting and even innovative; not many nuevo-Mexican establishments serve Chilaquiles on the menu. The mini tacos were good, with a veggie option, Carne Asada or Cochinita Pibill. The carne asada was grizzly (and remember, this is a mini taco - so to have all three bites to be grizzly was a disappointment. ) Conversely, the Cochinta was flavorful (but it was a little greasy))-- but man -it was delish! 

I ordered a side of Guacamole - yuck. But I also ordered a side of French Fries (don't ask what spurred that combination), which I LOVED. 5 Stars for the French Fries which came along with an Aoili Chili dipping sauce. 

The Gallo Blanco Cafe deserves your attention and hopefully they'll just continue to tweak the food a bit because the place has potential. 

(NOTE: I went for lunch, so I'm not sure what the bar atmosphere or happy hour/dinner is like.)
