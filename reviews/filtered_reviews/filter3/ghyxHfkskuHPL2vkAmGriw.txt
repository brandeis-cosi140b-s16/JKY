We yelped a breakfast spot in the Phoenix area and came across this joint. 4 star average with 350+ reviews. It sounded promising so we headed on out. Situated right next to a boutique hotel, inside there is not a wall separating the lobby area of that hotel and this restaurant. I'm guessing it's the hotel's restaurant. 

We decide to order the following:
-grilled Mexican corn. (quite tasty actually!)
-breakfast burrito with chorizo on the side (quite bland actually and required a lot of their salsa)
-carnitas and carne asada tacos
-eggs & chorizo plate 

Service was great and they made sure our waters and coffees were filled. While placing our orders our server provided helpful information which ultimately resulted in my decision to share my large portioned breakfast burrito since I wasn't very hungry.

All in all nothing to write home about. I've eaten at so many great Mexican taquerias (trucks, hole in the walls, restaurants) in CA and practically grew up with this cuisine that I'm sorry to report that was pretty underwhelmed with GB's foods.
