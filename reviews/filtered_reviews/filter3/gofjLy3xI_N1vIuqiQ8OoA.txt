I brought my mom here because she craves posole a lot and this was the closest place to her house LOL. It was a quick lunch and were only there for about an hour before we had to go. We both got posole...it was good, but it was what you made it, you know? It could be basic posole or an amazing kick in the mouth depending on how much lime (lemon in this case), chile, and onion you put in it. Mine was #bomb, Guys. I'm good that way. Anyway, I have no complaints except for the fact that they forgot to bring our drinks out at one point so we gave up on those. The horchata was also good but I didn't understand how a glass of Sprite cost more than the horchata, which some consider a unique drink. Beats me. Anyway, good enough to return if I had no other choice but not good enough that it would be my FIRST choice.
