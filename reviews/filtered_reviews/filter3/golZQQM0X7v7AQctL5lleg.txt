It was national nacho day so I decided to be patriotic and invite my mom to get some good greasy grub! She, much like me will never turn down the chance to some good mexican food or some quality mother daughter RR. 

We walked in and were greeted by a friendly hostess and were seated right away. Our server was friendly and efficient and checked back on us often. 

My only problem was the food - it wasn't that great. We started with the build your own guac dip. Sounded like a great idea but execution seriously lacked, and they charge and arm and a leg for it. It was a small scoop of plain guacamole with small dishes of tomatoes, red onion, jalape√±o and cilantro. Even mixed up on the plate it was lacking something.   I ordered a Carnitas Chimichanga and it lacked any real flavor - It was more filbertos $6.99 chimichanga than the $14.00 I paid for it, and even sadder the rice tasted burnt... such a bummer. It was a really disappointing dinner and I don't think I will be back.
