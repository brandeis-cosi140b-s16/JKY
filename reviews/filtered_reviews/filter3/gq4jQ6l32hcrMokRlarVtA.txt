Not in the best of areas, I wouldn't venture to this direction late at night.  Fortunately, we got up early Sunday and went for breakfast.  Nice decor and nice sizeable dining area, just past the bar upon entry.  We were seated near the kitchen/bussing area, which bothered the Mrs. Furniture could use an upgrade as the tables and chairs looked older. But I loved the Mexican decor and the place looked clean.

We went for the number one combo, two tamales, rice & beans.  Beans were very good, rice was moist (just the way I like it). Service was friendly, though we felt rushed by the older male waiter. Tamales were good but too much masa and cheese and not enough green chiles.  My wife didn't like the sweet tamales.  She did, however, like that they did not forget her to-go order, as some places do.  Points for that.  Also points for the delicioso salsa.

Another thing we liked was that they seemed to work as a team. We had three different people serve us, they didn't have separate stations and each server is on his/her own.

Negatives: $4.30 for a side of beans, $4.30 for a side of rice, $4+ for a tamale a la carte.  These same items are two-fifty in L.A.  I understand this is Vegas, but in this part of town?

So after my meal I had to make a little trip to the little boys' room.  Wouldn't you know, no toilet paper.  Who doesn't check and fill the paper roll before they open?  It was one of those rolls that has 10 feet of paper on it and I find the only one in Las Vegas that is out, at breakfast!!!   Fortunately, I checked before I did my business and improvised (I will not elaborate). I did let them know and they were polite about replacing it.

Not bad, but not a place I will go running back to.
