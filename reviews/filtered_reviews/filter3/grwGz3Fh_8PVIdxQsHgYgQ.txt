I recently saw a food network episode where they featured Chino Bandido. Since I love both Chinese and Mexican food it sounded like a real hit. The choices are all mix and match. Yes, they serve both Mexican and Chinese but you can turn your favorite Chinese dish into Mexican. Any of the Chinese fair can be served burrito style or even in a quesadilla. Some of the food is a bit more spicy, which I tend to like. I went the traditional route and had some of the JADE RED CHICKEN (Lightly coated, deep-fried chicken glazed with slightly spicy sweet sauce. Different and habit-forming) and the CARNITAS  (Mild, slow-cooked shredded pork saut√©ed with onion, tomato and cilantro) 
burrito style. The black beans are smoothe and spicy (yum!) To top it off I had the jerk style fried rice. To top it off your meal includes one of the best darn cookies you've ever had. The location in Chandler is huge so if you want to walk in with a big party they can accomodate you. It really is a must try.
