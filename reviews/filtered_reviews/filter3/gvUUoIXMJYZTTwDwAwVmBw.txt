I have attended a few Happy Hours here and have had good times. Th challenge is I get off at 3 and happy hour starts at 4. Sit around and wait for the happy hour prices. Otherwise it is expensive. During happpy hour all drinks are half off. I went yesterday and had a few beers. A $1 for each and I left with spending $15. My friend had 3 Jack & Cokes and left spending $12. I have ordered the happy hour food specials before and they are okay. Typical bar food - nothing special. 

I do like the location - right there next to the movies, sometimes people on stage just outside the outdoor patio. The place is packed, especially a Friday afternoon/evening. Convenient location to the highway make a good HH destination for me.
