Being that my bf gave the place a rave review (he went on taco night) and that it's owned by the fine purveyors of some of my favorite local pizza (Hawthornes) I was really looking forward to Loco Lime.

We were seated right away - cue the traditional music and the yummy salsa. I was a little sad that the chips weren't warm (I know I am kind of a stickler about little touches- especially if its not busy) but the salsa was really good so I ordered up my combo plate (chicken enchilada + beef chimichanga) and expected good things. 

I had recently visited the Taqueria and I will say Loco Limes Meat was much better! I enjoyed the chimichanga but I didn't care for the red sauce on my enchilada (it was oddly sweet). 

The server from Taco Night told my bf to hold on to his receipt and that if he visited again he would receive 10% off ...but I guess she was misinformed because they told him that was only valid if he used it at Common House or Hawthornes. I suppose it would have been nice to have a server who was clear on that stipulation - as ours didn't allow us to use it. 

Overall I wasn't really blown away  - I think I like La Paz and Cantina 1511better.
