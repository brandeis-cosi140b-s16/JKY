Since North Scottsdale is light on passable Mexican this becomes the de facto spot to scratch the occasional taco itch. Solid menu and a decent sports bar environment should you want to catch a game. Recent price increases to the menu have taken the luster off of what was once a solid member of my lunch rotation.
