We headed over to Dilworth to eat at Lebowski's the day after Christmas only to have our hopes dashed when it was closed.  Luckily, Cantina 1511 was open across the street.  And as a Mexican food snob, I can safely say that Cantina has the best salsa I've had since I left San Diego.  Spicy without being too spicy, flavorful, and good consistency to adhere itself to the chip.  I now regret not trying their guac.  Decent food overall.  But man, that salsa!  Start bottling it.
