So, I'm totally sure what the differene between New Mexican and just Mexican food is, but this place is New Mexican.

this location is pretty nice, with an huge shded patio area that has a rocking water feature that creates this spray-mist to cool off the area - granted, it's not so great when it's 110 out with 75 percent humidity, but it looks nice nontheless.

kind of family joint, on a par with Macayo's.
