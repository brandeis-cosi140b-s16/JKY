This is the 2nd time I went to Ru's. The first was the YELP event which was awesome! Then on a dinner with friends= service was very nice, came at the end so only had a side salad, and the place was busy.
I thought woo-hoo this place is going to become a regular place.
Then the LAST time went during 4pm or so. The place was completely empty and I stayed for 3hrs. I feel bad, the food is amazing and the drinks are too, but without ppl coming in and that the menu is expensive.....don't know if they will last.

Hope they do....
