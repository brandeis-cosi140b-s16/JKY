visiting from CA & my co workers and i were craving Mexican food. Food was good but service is terrible. It's a small place, I think I made eye contact with the server like 3 times. I understand they might have been busy but some acknowledgment would've helped. Aside from that, food was tasty but I don't think we'll be back.
