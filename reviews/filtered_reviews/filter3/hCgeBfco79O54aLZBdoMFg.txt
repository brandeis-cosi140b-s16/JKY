Enjoyed my lunch here.  Friendly staff.  Had the steak burrito - it was decent.  Very friendly bartender and staff.  Place was more of a bar that also had a kitchen than a restaurant with a bar.  I would come here for drinks with friends and likely eat somewhere else.  Food was definitely not California Mexican - meaning Manuel does not use the quality fresh healthy ingredients you get from California Mexican fusion.  This is more Mexican - refried, lots of cheese, and too many fried choices.  It all comes out looking gray and cheesy.  Three stars because the margarita was very good.
