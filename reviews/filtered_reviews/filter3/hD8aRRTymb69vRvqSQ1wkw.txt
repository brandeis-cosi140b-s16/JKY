I was in las vegas staying at the Paris hotel for my sisters bachelorette weekend and we decided to come here for breakfast before walking the whole strip. I thought it was way too early to drink so I didnt get to taste the drinks but the girls said they were strong and good. I don't recall the name of what I had for breakfast but do remember finishing the whole plate and it was just what i needed. In fact, all the girls devoured most of their food. We were at the outdoors seating and it was nice for people watching, and to plan our next adventure. I would return here on MY future bachelorette weekend !!
