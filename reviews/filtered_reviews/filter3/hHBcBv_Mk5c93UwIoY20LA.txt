I really wanted to LOVE Joyride after hearing all the hype. Did I LOVE it? No. Did I like it? Yes... 

The decor and atmosphere is fun and trendy. The chairs and booths were all comfy. HUGE bar area which I thought was great. 

Service was really good. We had two different ladies waiting on us. They were both friendly and attentive. 

Drinks and food were okay. I got the blood orange margarita. At first sip I was like "Wow this is great!" After a few more, it started to get SO sweet. I could barely finish it. I ordered the crispy fish, shrimp and ahi tacos. The crispy fish was actually really good but the other two were rather bland. The ahi was dry. I got black beans as a side and they were also very bland (I added some salt myself.). 

They give you complimentary chips and salsa in the beginning but it's a fire roasted salsa. If you want any other kind besides fire roasted you have to pay. 

Also, I wish they had a couple tvs at the bar area. We wanted to meet up with some friends to watch the USA soccer game and would have stayed here, but ended up going to a different restaurant to watch it since Joyride didn't have any tvs.

I will probably return to give this place another chance and maybe try some different things. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars but the food just didn't knock my socks off.
