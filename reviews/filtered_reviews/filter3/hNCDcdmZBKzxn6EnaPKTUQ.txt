Great local place. I was staying with a friend right down the street so Aunt Chiladas became the "go to" place when we didn't want to drive anywhere.  

I tried the chicken and spinach enchiladas as well as the seafood enchiladas on different visits.  The chicken and spinach enchiladas were bland but the seafood enchiladas were very good, containing shrimp and bay scallops. Each was accompanied by rice and beans, traditional although I thought that the beans had an overwhelming lard flavor.

The complimentary chips were good - including both flour and corn chips. The mild salsa was flavorful, with black olives in it...interesting.
