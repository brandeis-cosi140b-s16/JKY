We've been wanting to try this place for a long time and we finally had the chance today. I got the green chili pork enchiladas with half red, half green sauce. The green sauce was very flavorful and slightly spicy. I didn't really care for the red sauce though. Although it didn't make my top 10 list of favorite Mexican food restaurants, I would go again.
