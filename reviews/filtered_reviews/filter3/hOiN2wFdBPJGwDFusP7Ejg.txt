I have to agree with a lot of the reviews - most of what Emilianos has to offer is unremarkable - however: 

- The service is very fast and very friendly;
- The chips and salsa are free - and table-side guac is at least fresh and cheaper than whatever godawful price avocados are selling for these days; and,
- If you remember that this is Tex-Mex, not authentic Mexican food (go to Reyna's in the Strip), then you will find a decent, inexpensive lunch or dinner.

I'm happy with my experiences at Emiliano's and typically make it my go-to option for lunch when I'm at the SouthSide Works.
