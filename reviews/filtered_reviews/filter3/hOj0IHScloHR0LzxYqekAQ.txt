I would actually rate this place 3.5 but yelp doesn't give that option. 

I have been on the hunt for decent Mexican food since we moved to the area in June. 

There were definitely pros and cons to Carolina's. 

The place is big and was busy (order took 20+ minutes to come out after I went to the counter and asked the status of the order). The ordering line moved quickly and the girl who took my order was friendly and answered my questions. 

I ordered a chicken taco and a single tortilla (since that is what they are famous for). My daughters had the kids b&c burrito and the kids beef tacos. I also ordered the chips and salsa. They do have salsa on a bar area but it is dispensed in ketchup pump things. Which made the consistency more watery than the salsa that came with the chips and salsa. The salsa that came with the chips was much better even though it was probably the same recipe. I got a water to drink and it tasted like fish tank water. It was disgusting! I've worked in restaurants before and I would guess they never clean the soda taps. 

The taco was ok, the rice was bland and unimpressive and the tortilla was good but not the best I've ever had. However their beans were amazing!! I would go back and take my husband to try a bean and cheese burrito but am still on the look out for a Mexican restaurant that has it all. Coming from CA you get a bit spoiled!
