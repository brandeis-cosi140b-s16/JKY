We went to happy hour for the second time in a week and walked out! The bar was filled with old people and families. We will never return... ever!

Review...part 2...so we returned some time ago...the foods good and service is too...we've been through several different servers as well as changes in management...now the new change...no more Happy Hour on the weekends. When will the restaurant learn...to be continued .
