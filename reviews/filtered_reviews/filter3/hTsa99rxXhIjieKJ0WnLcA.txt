Love the food here!!! Chips and salsa with bean dip... AWESOME!!! I agree with the consensus that they have slow serving but always very friendly!!! I like that they have a person walking around doing pictures for guests... Nice touch!!! Great finish to the meal was the Pina Colada served in a fresh Pineapple!!! DELICIOUS!!!
