What else should some new england guys do when they're visiting family this close to mexico? Margaritas and tacos!

First off...don't be confused by the location. This business is one of the few that is not closed in this strip mall.  (I'm confused as to how the snow board rental shop didn't make it in AZ?)  The upside of this is plenty of available parking!  The decor is classic "Mexican restaurant in America", which I actually think is fun.

The service was decent, although for how slow the place was I think they could've been a little more attentive.  The staff is mainly high school/college age kids..who look like they're trying at least.  The waiter even ran after us as we were leaving to give my cousin her reading glasses ($1.99@walgreens) that she left on the table...not by any means because she had a couple margaritas.

Food was decent...I would definitely come back again for a casual bite.  We arrived at 4pm, which was awesome because the bar was having happy hour.  We each got a different margarita on the list.  I decided on the Don Quixote because I enjoy an aged tequila.  All of us decided that the marg's were quite tasty.  We ordered the sampler platter and a bunch of the $1 Tijuana tacos and must admit that they were very good.  I'll commonly do 'taco tuesdays' at a local bar in boston and their $2 taco's don't stand a chance next to these.  The sampler platter was okay, but I wouldn't order it again.

Our stomachs full of awesome tacos and margs...the only thing left to do while visiting family in phoenix is to stretch out under the sun and take a little siesta!
