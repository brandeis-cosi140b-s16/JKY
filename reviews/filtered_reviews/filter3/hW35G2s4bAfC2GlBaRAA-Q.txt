Service was great (Even though we were in a very large group, and probably got a little noisy as the night went on).

Drinks were perfect!

Food was bland.  No flavor, and not cooked well (overcooked enchiladas are chewy like a Charleston Chew candy bar--yuck).  When we got back to the hotel we actually had to order some food to satisfy our hunger since no one really ate the food we had at dinner.
