Went here with Clients from out of state kindy by accident. Was supposed to go someplace else (which non of us could find) and somebody called and said *I'm in front of Sandbar, lets just go here* We all aggreed! Not any of our usual tastes but it was ok. Did not have a rude waitress, the front desk girls was pleasant, the drings were good and the food delish! And there was loads of food! Big portions! A Sports Bar, a little loud at times during the game, had to yell a few times across our table conversing. The only thing i did not like was after the bill was paid, NOTHING! Not even water!
