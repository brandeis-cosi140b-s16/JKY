We arrived at ~8pm with a party of 5 on a Friday evening. Got seated immediately and lucking it was one of the places that was still open to under 21 guests, which FYI is hard to find downtown after 9pm.

What I liked:
The mason jar cups, patterned wallpaper, and hipster servers really gave it that downtown feel with a cool modern Hispanic flavor. Our server was pretty great as well, and I really enjoyed the energy and fun all of the server shared with one another.

What I ordered:
The Ceviche de Camaron - Worst ceviche I've ever had... It was caked with some kind of cilantro sauce. Also the shrimp was very small, something you'd find in a cheap buffet. But the plantain chips were a nice spin, it was the first time I had them with ceviche.

Mexican Burger - *Beware* if your server recommends the Mexican burger don't get it. Three of us ordered it and none of us finished it... came out very rare. Wish my server asked me how I wanted it cooked. The sweet potato fries were very mushy and got cold quick as well.

They gave us unlimited family style rice and beans for FREE with our entrees which was great, but they taste pretty average. Don't be impressed, but heck at least they were free!

The service:
Server was terrific and very knowledgeable of the menu and it's offerings. All of their servers seemed like hipsters and did a great job taking care of one another's tables.

Overall, I was not very impressed by this place and I can see why they have a 3 1/2 star rating on yelp. 

Imho, La Comida was an exceptional experience for it's atmosphere but the food quality and taste really disappointed. I would highly recommend this place for the atmosphere and vibe, the food not so much. If you're feeling mediocre Mexican food and want to experience the new downtown feel give it a shot. 

Atmosphere 5/5
Service 3/5
