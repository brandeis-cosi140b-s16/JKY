We went here while visiting our son and grandson in Phoenix

I cant say that I was too impressed with the meal. I got a beef tamale and 2 beef enchiladas which were OK but far from anything special. The Fiedo was pretty tasty and we both thought that the chips and salsa were good, especially the flour ones.

Will we go back, possibly during happy hour for the free buffet and because the chips and salsa here are very tasty.
