Average Mexican food, nothing special.  I had the chile rellenos which were decent.  I'm not used to paying for chips and salsa.  $4 is a little steep for what should be complimentary.  Chips were straight out of a bag.  Salsa was pretty good.  Overall, one of the better values at New York New York.
