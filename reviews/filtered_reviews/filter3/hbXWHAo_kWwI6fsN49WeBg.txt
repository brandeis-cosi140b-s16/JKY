Wow, can't believe there are no reviews on this place yet....guess it doesn't make an impression.   Went here yesterday for lunch with some friends, we all finished our plates.  I feel like this is a REAL nice place for dinner as far as the atmosphere but nothing on the menu really gets me the need to eat here.  I ordered a spinach enchilada and avocado enchilada with beans and potatoes.  The spinach one was good but the avocado wasn't special, the beans were less than average but the potatoes were kinda of different but in a good way.  I wish I could find something here that I could crave because the service is always good and the atmosphere is just awesome.  Guess I will keep coming here till I find my combo.
