I have been going to Dona Maria's for about 6 years and I have to say that the quality has been going the wrong direction.  I went there this past week with my parents.  My Mom's cocido had hardly any meat in it.  Also, they were also stingy on the vegetables.  My Dad had tacos and they were ok, but is it just me or does it seem wrong to be red sauce on a ground beef taco? Just saying.

I had the chicken fajitas and I was impressed with the amount of actual chicken in the fajitas.  

The tortillas were exceptional, however I am not sure I want to pay as much as this place costs for stellar torts....
