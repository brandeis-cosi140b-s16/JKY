Excellent food and service (read the flow of beer was satisfyingly rapid) overall, the green salsa was wonderfully balanced providing a nice amount of heat with an excellent amount of taste. Unfortunately, I was slightly disappointed in my gorditas as the chicken was slightly dry but otherwise the rice and beans were definitely above par. Unlike some Mexican or New Mexican restaurants I was pretty pleased with the freshness of the ingredients, I didn't see brown lettuce or greenish tomatoes, and while the chicken was disappointing the rest of our dining party was greatly pleased. I will definitely go back to take a stab at the enchiladas or something else that impressed everyone else.
