This restaurant was one of the first I visited after moving to Scottsdale from Southern California.  The food wasn't horrendous and the service wasn't atrocious, but there were definitely things that could have been better.  

The sauces were a little bland and so that in turn made the food not too memorable.  It lacked that authenticity that I had grown to love at home and seemed more like a more expensive Del Taco experience.  

The service wasn't terrible but there were not that many people there and it seemed that neither was the staff.  This, I never hold against the waiters themselves as I have no clue what has been going on throughout the day.  

So, all in all, it isn't a terrible place to go, but I will keep my eye out for a more authentic Mexican experience.
