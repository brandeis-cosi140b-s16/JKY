Food was good. Drinks were good. Service was so so. Had to ask for my wife's drink twice. When it came it was wrong. Then we were double charged for her drink on the bill and had to argue our case with the waiter to get it corrected. We should not have to audit our restaurant bill and fight to get to pay the right amount.

We will come back as we are new to the neighborhood and realize that sometimes any staff can have an off day. 

The restaurant may want to invest in a POS system though as the waiter didn't know what we ordered. He apparently added up our bill by looking at the glasses and empty plates on our table.......
