Clusterf*ck. Zoo. Frustrating. One line is for al pastor, one line is for carne asada, etc, etc., which means you have to endure multiple slow-ass lines if you want different meats. Bf wasn't too impressed with $2 tacos; he thought the prices were high for taqueria food (I.e. $10 for carne asada fries.) 

I chose not to order any meat on my fries at all because the threat of meat contamination was imminent...I could just see it now -- I order steak & end up with tongue & brains chopped up in my meal. No f*cking thank you. 

My fries were covered in cheese, guac, & crema. I asked for red sauce, which helped moisten & spice up my mess of crispy, creamy, fatty goodness. 4 stars for the fries & having orange bang in the soda fountain. 3 stars for the crowd & irritating order process (line up to order, line up to pay.) 

I'm sure he'll want to go back, but in my expert Mexican-food opinion, it ain't all that. I'd prefer to go elsewhere.
