Stopped in before catching a Midnight Movie and was looking forward to the Fish Tacos, but I got there after 10 pm and they only had Steak & Chicken Tacos, but they did have a great, cheap late night menu.

Decided to try out the Sonoran Hot Dog and the Bucket of Wings.  They were both fantastic.  The Wings were a pleasant surprise as I'm a Wing-a-holic and wasn't expecting much but after my first one, I was hooked.  They had some great flavor with just the right amount of kick.

The service was a bit slow for the limited crowd, but it was a fun crowd and atmosphere and the staff was friendly.  I wasn't looking to drink Alcohol and unfortunately they were out of Iced Tea with 3 1/2 hours left before closing, so that was a down side, but overall experience was favorable and I look forward to stopping back in before 10 pm for some Fish Tacos soon..
