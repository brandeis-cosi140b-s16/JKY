Stopped by today for lunch after a few recommendations from friends. Decided to go with the 'award winning' Pork Barbacoa burrito, which while delicious, quickly fell apart in my hands leaving their sauce everywhere and causing me to have to get a knife/fork to finish it. The restaurant has a very similar ordering/seating arrangement to Chipotle/Qdoba. I was very pleased with the serving size compared to a similar meal at Chipotle, and with it being rather close to home, I'll be sure to stop by and try some other dishes (hopefully ones that don't fall apart after 2 bites).
