This place was suprisingly OK for Arizona restaurants.  The Roast Corn Gordita appetizer is very spicy but very good.  I got the mushroom taco and really did not like it.  But some of my other friends ordered the chicken, pulled pork and the squash tacos and liked them.  The pumpkin bread pudding was very yummy.  I would have just been happy ordering that! lol  being we were there for a bachelorette dinner, they brought out a sparkler with the complementary bread pudding which was a nice surprise for the occasion.  The service was not very tentative so things seemed to drag out.  But i am from the east coast so we like things on a faster pace then most.  If you like this type of food i would recommend trying it out.
