I was craving nachos, so we decided to try here. Saturday night, about 7-ish, no problem getting a table, but we waited a bit for our server. Once she came, she was great, but it took a bit. 
The menu is huge...but the first half it is drinks. Not kidding. I had a Wyder's pear ale, which I haven't seen elsewhere - really refreshing & good. 
I opted for the BBQ chicken nachos - yum! Lots of cilantro, though, so may want to ask the kitchen to back off if you aren't a fan. My husband had the steak fajitas, and added shrimp for $3 more. He had about half left to bring home. 
It wasn't a bad experience, I just wasn't wowed.
