I was torn with this place... 

We stopped in for a late lunch on a Saturday.  It wasn't too busy so we were able to browse the menu and find seating without a problem.  There is one line for the al pastor tacos, another line for all other types of tacos and another station for nachos or bowls.  The al pastor looked really good as he was carving it off for my taco.  Honestly, it didn't have as much flavor as I hoped it would.  Don't get me wrong.  It was good... just not memorable.  The nachos were ok.  Again I had the al pastor for the meat topping.  Bummer.  Not so much flavor.  

I will definitely say their contemporary decor and a DJ spinning the tunes as I walk in was definitely a surprise.  I wish they would clean the tables a little more often upstairs though.  

I had high hopes and was disappointed.
