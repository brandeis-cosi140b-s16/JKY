Here is the deal. If you want to go with a bunch of friends, drink your face off, fall down, maybe puke. This is the place for you!!! And at $25/ All you can drink! How can you do better?

But don't think you will get to sober up with food, they stop serving food around 9PM - BOOO!  I can't write about the food, we never tasted even a tortilla chip. But based on the food reviews, that may have been a blessing in disguise.

We went with a bunch of friends, and honestly had a blast! Dancing, big booty contests, pure contained madness. It was fun! Not sure I would run back, but thoroughly enjoyed the night we had here. 

And then headed over to Tacos El Gordo for food! (the best late night tacos on the strip) Because we were STARVING!
