We were looking for a good lunch spot to get out of the heat, enjoy some more upscale mexican food and say goodbye before we all left for the airport. 

Made a reservation on Yelp after reading the reviews. Still had to wait when we got there, but we won $21.00 on the penny slots while waiting so it paid for part of the lunch ;)

You have to pay for chips and salsa and we had 3 die-hard salsa fans, so we ordered two orders - which got pricey, especially because there is not a lot of salsa in each order (although what you do get was very, very good). 

I had the vegetarian enchiladas and added guacamole (for an extra charge). The sauce could have used a little more punch in the flavor, but all and all it was really good. I enjoyed the cilantro rice as well.

The other two dinners ordered the chicken burrito and taco lunch specials and said they both loved their meal. 

Cool drink menu presentation at the table (like an iPad type menu) and the service was good and attentive. I liked how dark it felt in there - good ambience to forget you are in bright, hot Vegas. 

Decent meal - I am not sure I would rush back when I am back in Vegas, but recommend if you like a little upscale American version of Mexican food and some good salsas. 

(I tried to forget the name was Yolo the entire time I was there - was that named intentionally or coincidentally?)
