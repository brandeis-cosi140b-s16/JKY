I went during Happy Hour for Half Price wings. Not many other folks there.

Had the San Francisco wings. Good value and nice presentation. My personal taste is the crispy deep fried wings though like they have at Gene's Last Chance in the Strip district; otherwise, I would bump the review up another star.

There is a mid-day half price food discount for students along with the 11p-closing for everyone. I'll definitely have to come back after 11p to try a burrito or something.
