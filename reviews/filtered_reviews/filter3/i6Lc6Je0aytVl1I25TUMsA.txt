Okay so I'm conflicted about Burrito Factory. I'd probably give 3.5 stars if that was an option but it's not so I'm sticking with 3. There are a few things on this menu that I'd give a higher rating to. The nachos for example I really love. You can put basically anything you want on them to build your own and that's awesome!! The burritos are okay. We've tried the steak fajita, the chicken, and the california wet burritos. The first two lacked any kind of real flavor. No spices or salt or anything else appeared to have been used. However these burritos are packed full of ingredients and they don't skimp. The California wet burrito is better but again just okay. They give you salsa, and they have these other sauces. The orangeish looking sauce is my boyfriends favorite. He always wants me to order extra extra of that stuff as he can't get enough. It will save the burritos lol!! The plantains are good (hard to mess that up) and the queso is good but could use jalapenos in my opinion. We order delivery from them frequently and the poor delivery guy apparently has issues. He's really nice but sometimes I feel like he lacks awareness. He's delivered to us like 4 maybe 5 times and he still calls to ask exactly where our complex is because it doesn't show up on his GPS. I really am going to need him to update his GPS or use google maps!! However our food still always arrives pretty hot so that's a plus, the negative is my sour cream arrived melted into a soup so I just don't order it anymore lol. This place is a convenience factor for us so we'll probably continue ordering from here on occasion. I feel like if a few kinks were worked out this place could really shine.
