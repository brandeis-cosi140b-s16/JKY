We went to Coyote's for lunch after seeing a movie at Galaxy.  It was larger than I was expecting, I saw an occupancy sign that said 220.  The booths were spacious and comfortable.  We didn't venture far into the restaurant, or to the restrooms, but what we saw was very clean.  Our drink order was taken very quickly, and our chile con queso came out quickly as well.  This is made with real cheese, no processed stuff here.  You can tell because when you tried to get it onto your chip, it left LONG strings of cheese back to the bowl.  This made eating a little difficult, but we loved it.  Not a lot of places near us have queso this good, we'll definitely return to get some more.  It could use more heat, but I generally think that, so I don't knock a star off for failure to make something hot enough.

We each had a lunch special, my wife had the crab enchilada, and I had the Zarape, which is basically a large flour tortilla stuff with chopped fajita beef and topped with red and green sauce.  As per usual, I liked the green sauce better.  If I got this dish again, I would ask for all green sauce.  I thought the meat was very good, it was completely cooked, no pink whatsoever.  So, it was overcooked for my tastes.  But, it had good flavor.  I understand it's the lunch portion, but I feel like I had a lot of bites that were just tortilla and cheese, no meat. 

The rice and beans were good, I'd say above average for those typically served with an equivalent Mexican dish.  Also, as I looked through the rest of the menu, the prices seemed high for this type of establishment.  I certainly enjoyed my lunch, and would return to Coyote's, but some of the dinners seemed to be a few dollars higher than I would expect at a similar restaurant for the same dish.
