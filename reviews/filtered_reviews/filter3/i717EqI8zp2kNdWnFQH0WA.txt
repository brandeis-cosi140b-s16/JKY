This place is located at the World Furniture Market.  There were no events that day, so there was plenty of parking.  The interior is very posh (its in the World Furniture Market, so it has to be nicely decorated).  The chips were over salted, but the salsa was yummy.  It tasted homemade with lots of veggie chunks.  I ordered the chicken quesadilla for $12.  The other two people at the table ordered a cobb salad and the carnitas.  The food took a long time to come out and they were not very busy.  The food presentation was very elegant.  (When I think of Mexican food I don't think elegant.)  The portion sizes are small.  The food was tasty.  The best attributes of this place are the atmosphere and the food presentation.  If you are going for food, then there are better places in Vegas (taste just as good, but cheaper with larger portion sizes).
