Fantastic service in such a small but cozy diner-esque place.  The food was really good, with soft corn tortillas a fresh ingredients.  If you dine in, they also provide fresh homemade salsas and chips.  Food was just a tad underseasoned for me but the fast and friendly yet unobtrusive service definitely more than made up for it.  Check them out!
