We descended on this place for happy hour and a early dinner. We were in the mood for some chips and salsa and tacos. We arrived  little past 5 on Tuesday. They had some really good happy hour prices, so we ordered couple of drinks and ordered the flight of salsas and guacamole. Then we each ordered 3 tacos and split some steak fries. She ordered the chicken and I got the pork tacos.                                                          Overall I thought the food was pretty good but nothing special. I am hard to please though, cause my lady is Hispanic and her family cooks some of the most amazing Mexican food I've ever eaten.  The great thing about this place is the happy hour and the prices.  We paid a little over 30 for couple of drinks, salsas and tacos. Not bad at all. The service was good though and the food came out quickly.  I would go back again but prolly try something different.
