Well I think it was us, cuz we were expecting something else.  First of all we thought we were in Richardson's, which now I see is next door.  But as the place is under remodel we weren't quite sure where to enter and so we went in here.  It was very dark and noisy, I felt the music was too loud, but at the time I didn't know that this was the bar.  Anyway we weren't in a great mood to party and so that put a damper on the dinner.  So in all honesty, I will have to go back and try it when we aren't being so pissy.  The service was slow, the water tasted off, the shrimp quesadillas weren't worth the money, but the pork green chile rellano's were delicious, spicy, smokey and flavorful.  I felt the beans and rice were okay, could have been cooked a little more thoroughly.  I also thought the price $15 was a little high for 2 rellano's, should be more like $12, but I won't bitch and moan for $3.  The order of pork gc enchiladas for take away lunch the next day were very tasty and much appreciated.  So as I said maybe it was our pissy mood, we'll see next time at Richardson's.
