To me, this place is almost like an upscale filibertos. It has a real quaint and nice home style environment that's very inviting. But sadly it stops about there. I tried one of the breakfast burritos because everyone else rants about them and to be honest it couldn't shake a stick at one from filibertos. The overall burrito was somewhat small and the potatoes were simply mushy, not really holding any form. I wasn't really pleased by my experience but I decided to try it another day (chips and salsa are chips and salsa, can't really mess that up)

About a week later I went back for a three rolled taco combo. Surprisingly, they managed to take the deep frying step and double the length of it I assume, leaving them in too long. I was at the end of the lunch rush is that helped any. What should have been crispy/soft rolled tacos turned into thick tough chips filled with meat.  I was too disappointed and just ready to wash my hands clean of the place so I didn't raise a fuss. 

All in all, it's a personalized filibertos that offers chips and salsa with most meals. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be healthy mexican food but either way it wasn't that tasty for me. I'm glad the rest of you had good experiences.
