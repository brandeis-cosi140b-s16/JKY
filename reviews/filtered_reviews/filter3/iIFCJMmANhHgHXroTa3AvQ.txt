We made another lunch stop at Braddah's Island Style on our most recent vacation and once again shared a Kalua pig burrito with seaweed rice, black beans, charred pineapple verde, lettuce and tomato. Even though management committed the unpardonable sin of running out of cilantro, our burrito were still very good. The staff seemed less friendly or engaged than on our first visit just 6 months ago.  For example, no samples were offered, tables had not been bussed, and bottles of sauce were not put out until a good 10 minutes after a customer made the request.  A rating of 3.5 would be most appropriate.
