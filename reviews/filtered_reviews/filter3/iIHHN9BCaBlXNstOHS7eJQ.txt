Went to Vida this past Sunday with my family after a friend suggested this place.  I am always in the mood for good Mexican food, so we headed uptown for this place.

We sat outside, on the bar side since the dine-in side was pretty crowded.  I thought that the crowd meant the food was good, so I was happy.  We were pretty hungry so we ordered the Chips and Salsa and added the Guacamole for an appetizer.  My wife and daughter shared in the 6 tacos platter while I opted for the Nachos and added some groud beef at an additional charge.

The service was decent.  Nothing really special, but I felt like we were taken care of.  The Chips arrived first and were pretty good.  The Salsa was Fantastic!!  Probably my favorite part of the meal.  The Guacamole left a lot to be desired.  My wife and I both agreed that it was pretty bland and needed some salt to heighten the flavor.

My Nachos were ok.  My only knock on is that the ground beef was also very bland.  It really had no taste.  The 6 Tacos platter included 2 veggie tacos, 2 fried chicken tacos and 2 grilled chicken tacos.  I was surprised to see that the soft flour tortillas were fried and therefore, were very greasy.  I was not a fan of that and neither was my wife.  

For drinks, we ordered 2 ginger ales and 1 lemonade for my daughter.  My wife thought the lemonade tasted like what they would use for a Margarita.

Overall, we spent about $45 including a 15% tip.  So I don't think the place is too bad price-wise, considering we got plenty of food.  But I wish the flavors were more vibrant.

The waitress did mention that the menu is different with more options on the dine-in side of the venue, so I might give this place another chance some day since we were sitting on the "bar" side.
