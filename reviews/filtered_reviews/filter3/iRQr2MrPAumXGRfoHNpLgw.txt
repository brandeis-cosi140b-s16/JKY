I have had one 5 star visit here and one 1 star visit, so the average is 3 stars.

First time was great!  Our waiter was a Bonanza High School student who was so charming and friendly.  He gave us some free guac because we told him it was our first time there.  I got the Fusion Burrito, which was surprisingly delicious, and my husband got the orange chicken.  The staff was really friendly and we talked with the owner about how she wants to open another location.

I had been itching to go back since then and we went last night.  Now, they had just opened up again after being on Christmas vacation, so I don't know if that is why it was so crazy in there,  but our second experience wasn't as good.  It was very crowded at 8:00 on a Wednesday night. My husband wanted the orange chicken again, but they had taken it off the menu.  He was really disappointed by that.  I ordered the carne de puerco. Unfortunately, the meat was cold and the rice and beans looked like they were from a can.  The owner was the only one waiting tables this time, so she was super frazzled.

I like this place and I like the lady who owns the restaurant, so I'll definitely be back, but my last visit definitely moved them down a few notches for me.
