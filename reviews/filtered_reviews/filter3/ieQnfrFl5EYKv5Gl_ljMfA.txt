Two words: THE SMELLS. AHHHH! As soon as you walk downstairs into this, what I'd like to say, authentic Spanish underground oasis, you get hit with these amazing smells and they give you ALL of the feels! :) At first look, you see everyone eating outside wrapping around the restaurant/market but if you go inside, you'll find a stairwell to leads downstairs. There's no windows down there but it feels like you're in something straight from Mexico City. Loved the atmosphere. 

I learned that they make all of their tortilla shells and chips fresh right there in the restaurant, hence all of the smells.  All of their margaritas are made fresh as well with fruit juices and agave nectar. Try the guava margarita if it's on special! A-MAZ-ING. 

The menu itself is pretty big with a lot of selections. I recommend trying the salsa sampler for as low as $3! Try at least the mango one. Nice and sweet.  

Even though the menu gives you a wide selection, I'd say the prices are slightly higher than normal. Maybe because it's an authentic Spanish restaurant but who knows. I went with the steak tacos topped with onions and fresh cilantro with a side of black beans... I had to choose between beans OR rice... not both... which is not favorable in my opinion. I'm a hungry man! I need both. 

If you're looking for an authentic Spanish restaurant with a great atmosphere, I would definitely recommend this place in the Strip District. Great food, drinks and feel but just a little pricey for not-so-much food and I wish our waitress would've checked in on us more often (all reasons for the 3-star review). But all in all, a great time!
