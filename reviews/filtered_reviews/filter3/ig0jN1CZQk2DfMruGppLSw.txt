I was debating for a long time whether to review this place or not cause technically I didn't really eat here except for chips & salsa.  However, tis my duty to keep my readers informed!  

As many of you might already know I'm a fan of the AA Club. (Affordable Alcohol)  SFC definitely had that going especially during HHH (For those that don't enjoy the AA, HHH stands for Happy Hoang Hour) Yes, my fellow AA member and I order 3 drinks only for a quick stay and it came out to only $7.50.  Wowza - we gasped! -- and drank!

The Chips & Salsa?  Well they claimed to have a pretty "spicy" salsa, but in the end I had to add some Tabasco to bring it up a notch.  Needless, to say, I ate two baskets full of chips - oink oink! 

Service was real good actually for a place like this.  I expected more attitude and I don't care what you think flare, but I was rather impress.  You smile and I will too -- Thanks Lindsey.

The place is a Cantina and I don't expect it to be fancy by any means.  It wasn't pretty and it definitely made me feel I was south of the border -- patrons were happy drunk Americans ye-haw! - Enjoy!
