Pretty neat place. I'd never seen this chain before. I got a burrito with grilled chicken, enchilada style. SUPER glad I got it enchilada style--that sauce is great! I wish, however, that I got shredded chicken. Oh well. The burrito is a good size; I split it with a friend and we were both fill at the end without being stuffed. I'd definitely come back!

(One thing I thought was weird though, is the price for the quesadilla was more than the burrito! Wonder why?)
