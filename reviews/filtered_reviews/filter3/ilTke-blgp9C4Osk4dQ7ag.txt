For the longest time I've wanted to try Dona Marias Tamales, however I was certain that they only served tamales and little more.  When I finally browsed their online menu I was pleasantly surprised, as DMT is just down the street from me.  At this point I can only speak to the tamales and chips and salsa, but I do plan a return visit to try more.  The complimentary chips and salsa are fresh and more tasty than most competitive places, however I probably won't order the tamales again.  I was disappointed that they were lacking in the flavor department.  With tamales in the name of the restaurant, I expected them to be quite noteworthy.  Their service was very prompt and friendly, as I walked in to place my order and my tamales to-go were ready in about 10-15 minutes.
