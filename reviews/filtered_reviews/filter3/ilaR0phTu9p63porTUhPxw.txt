It has a nice patio and decent quality ingredients however the flavors are geared for tourists who want to tread lightly. 

To best enjoy yourself here come order a marrita sit on the patio and snack on some chips with your dip of choice. Note the salsa is quite mild again for the tourists I believe. The service here is quite good as is the selection on the menu.
