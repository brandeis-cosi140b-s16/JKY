My wife and I had dinner on Saturday evening. We started with some drinks. My mojito and my wife's sangria were excellent. Unfortunately, the drinks ended up being the highlight of the evening. For an appetizer, we had queso fundido, which consisted of a lot of melted cheese, a few jalape√±o peppers and an occasional roasted red pepper.  I found it lacking flavor, especially considering the amount of calories that must have been in the thing. The cheese was very chewy and my mouth actually got tired of chewing. For entrees, I had one of the night's specials, short rib enchiladas and my wife had the chicken enchiladas. We had to send them back initially because they were cold. (To Verde's credit, they comped half of the appetizer to compensate.) The short ribs enchiladas were good, except that they were small and had very little short rib. They were mostly potatoes and carrots. My wife had the chicken enchiladas. They were fine.  Overall, a solid three stars. However, one must consider the cost. My meal was $18 and my wife's was $16 - pretty expensive for Mexican food that was only slightly better than your local Mexican restaurant that serves $5 lunch specials consisting of two nicely sized enchiladas, plus a mound of beans and rice.
