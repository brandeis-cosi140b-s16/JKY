Went here for lunch today with my husband. We have lived in chandler for 8 years and this was our 1st visit. We did not sit out on the patio due to the weather. The inside was kinda small and I really disliked that there were no booths. The bar was very open to the dining area which made it very loud. The tables were all covered in white table cloths but the chairs were like cheap outdoor patio chairs, These chairs were not comfortable at all. 
I ordered the burrito enchilada style with shredded beef. My husband ordered a combo with a taco and burro. In my opinion the food was only ok. And for the price I hoped it would have been better. They uncharged me $2 for the enchilada style. $1 for a very small side of sour cream.  Chips and Salsa were pretty good. Service was very slow. Overall this didn't live up to my expectations. However I would consider going again to sit out on the patio.
