I went to this Sandbar location (my first time ever at a Sandbar even though I lived close to the one in Chandler) not too long ago with a few friends. It was interesting and had a cute beachy vibe with actual sand on the ground. Maybe I would have thought it was more cute if I wasn't in boots. :( Darn you fall fashion staples in Arizona. 
Anyways, there's an indoor and outdoor bar. And this place was packed on a Saturday night. Like packed to the point where I was trying to go to the restroom and some fratty douche backed it up into me. Have no fear, he got pushed into his clan of douches. 
So this place would be cool maybe if I was super drunk before I got there. But I wasn't. And I didn't get super drunk (I think?). Typical club-ish scene. I guess I'm just a grandma in a 21 year olds body and was expecting more of a laid back bar since my parents went to the Chandler location before, LOL. Darn.
