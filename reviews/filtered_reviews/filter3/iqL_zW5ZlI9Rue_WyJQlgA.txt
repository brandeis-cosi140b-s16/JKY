I think everything about LUXOR is average 3 stars. Except for the hot drunken girls. They do score some points. 

Onward... Tacos & Tequila is expensive. And I mean for a burrito, expect to dish out around $16. Jeezzzz man... 

Our order was a burrito, 2 drinks, and a side order of rice. And it came out $25+ but the bar tender was really cool. Really easy going dude... so was the hostess and the rest of the staff. So good ups there. 

It was crowded and the place was jammin' - just the way I like it. Alot of good looking people, good energy, and aside from the steep price. The food was was pretty damn good. 

TIP: Sit at the bar and avoid waiting 463 hours for a table. Orders are quick and service done with a smile.
