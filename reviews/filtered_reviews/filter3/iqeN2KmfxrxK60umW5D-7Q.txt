First off, I will say the outdoor patio almost made this a 4, but I couldn't quite do it. But the patio is amazing and the cutest place to be in March in Scottsdale.

I walked here from the Valley Ho with some girlfriends, we were craving some Mexican food after a pool day. 

The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was spicy like I like it.

I got fish tacos, which I like to try everywhere because they are my favorite. I like that the fish was grilled, but the tacos could not be picked up because they were so soggy. I had to eat them with a fork and knife, which wouldn't have been bad but they didn't wow me. The beans and rice were better actually. The price was good for the amount of food though, $12 for 3 fish tacos, rice and beans. 

You can customize any dish which was nice for my vegan friend.

I wanted to try and margarita because they looked great, huge fishbowl glasses. It looks like happy hour may be the time to try those.

Another thing I thought was weird was that there was 6 of us but our server said he could only split the bill 3 ways maximum. Good thing most of us had cash, still strange in this day and age though.

I thought it was good and I would go back to that patio again without persuasion, but not topping my list for Mexican food.
