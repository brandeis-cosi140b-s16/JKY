Came in at 330 on a Tuesday.  I assume this was their slow time as there was only a handful of patrons and at least 3 or 4 servers and 1 bartender. 3 female servers walked right by me without saying hello or acknowledging me. I hate that.  Makes you feel like they don't want you there. After 5 minutes a gentleman approached and asked if I had been helped. He took a drink order and returned with a menu. Nice guy but he had a dirty broom and dustpan in has hands the whole time....not very appetizing.  A few minutes later, the bartender took my order. I had the Tingo tacos. Tacos were very good as were the chips and salsa. They bring 2 salsas, red and green and both were very good. I really appreciate it when the person taking care of me comes back to see how my food tastes, promptly.  The female bartender did come back to my table but after I was halfway through. If I had had a problem she would have never known it. I asked for a to go box and she brought me one. As I was packing my food in the box I dropped a chip. I didn't feel like getting down at the moment to pick it up and I watched as all of the female servers walked by, more than once and never picked the chip up. Two mail servers did the same thing. There's no way they didn't notice it. It was right in the middle of the walkway and they just stared at it and did nothing. You can always tell when people don't like their job and that's the impression I got from this restaurant. None of the staff smiled at me and none of them seemed like they cared that I was there at all.  It's too bad, the food was very good. When I come to a restaurant I don't expect people to do cartwheels and shoot off fireworks when I come in. However I do expect to be greeted and treated with kindness and a smile. These people all walked around with frowns on their faces and with the attitude that they just didn't care.
