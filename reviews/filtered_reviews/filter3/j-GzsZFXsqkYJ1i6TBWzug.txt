I've heard nothing but good things about this place but I didn't think it was great. The food was delicious, I ordered New Mexico enchiladas with an egg. However, the service was horrible. We waited a good 10 minutes before someone came to get our DRINK order.  And I had to wait a few more minutes for them to refill my drink.
