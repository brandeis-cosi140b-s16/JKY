This place has a cool atmosphere and a unique style to their food. However, the place is so loud that I had to yell across the table to talk. The music is loud so therefor everyone yelling to socialize. It is over priced as well. For a small glass of rose wine it was 10.50. And it was a very small glass. They consider the plates sharing size. They're not. We ordered the chili rellenos thinking it was for two for 18.50. They were the smallest plates for 18.50 (barely for one person).That being said, the food was yummy. They made unique salsas and sauces. The food is very different from a normal mexican restaurant.
