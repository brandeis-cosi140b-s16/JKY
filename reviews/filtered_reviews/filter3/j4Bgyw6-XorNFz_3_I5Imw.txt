I was pretty excited to try KoMex, but it turned out not really meeting my expectations. The food is great if you want either Korean or Mexican, but it wasn't that great at executing fusion flavors. Ex: the bulgogi fries were just fries, cheese, jalapenos, and not very much bulgogi. Plus, the bulgogi didn't taste too much like bulgogi and more just like beef, so then the whole dish was just carne asada fries.

The tacos were similar. The chicken was really bland and not particularly Korean, but the pork and bulgogi were better. The kimchi fried rice was well made, but that's not fusion.

Great service and prices. It was around $20 for 3 entrees.
