The outdoor patio is very charming with lots of beautiful plants, trees, fountains, authentic looking outdoor oven and comfortable patio furniture. It sets the ambience for a relaxed dining experience, which might compensate for mediocre food and service. It's worth a visit to relax on the patio. Parking is convenient.
