I had never been here before, but I do get their menus in the mail.  We decided to try it because we were told kids eat free on Mondays.  The place was packed so obviously very popular.  We only waited about 15 minutes.  Minus a few hiccups, service was good and the food was good.  I'm not sure if our Margaritas were really the doubles we ordered but they tasted very good.  My brother had the fajitas which were great but a little skimpy on the chicken.   It ended up being pretty expensive and I notice my kids' meals were still charged.  That was taken care of right away for us.  Overall I would definitely go back.
