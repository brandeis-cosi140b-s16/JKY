My husband and I were in Scottsdale for the weekend. We were shocked by the lack of good Mexican food but decided to try a sit down option and found Barrio Queen. The atmosphere is fun. Very eclectic but festive. The table side guac was good but hardly guacamole - more like an avocado salsa. It still had great flavor. I ordered the suiza enchiladas. Too much congealed cheese for my liking. Lots of oils and other unidentifiable liquids on my plate. Even though our waitress was pleasant and attentive, I probably won't return.
