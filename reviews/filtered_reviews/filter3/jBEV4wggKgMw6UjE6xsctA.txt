I have been there a few times, both at the Rokeriji and Richardsons, but today I shall do a review for the Rokeriji.    First off, since they are side by side and have the same owner, I am giving both restaurants three and one-half stars.   I have had pan-seared salmon and the beef tenderloin skewers off of the "small plates" menu.    Both are cooked and flavored to perfection.   Yummm!!   Last night for dinner I had the carne adovada, and my companion had the chimayo chicken.    I tasted his chicken, and, yes, it was good but nothing outstanding.   I liked my meal much better.   His side dish of the potato on the poblano was typical mashed potato with a chili flavor.     I guess that would make sense since it was sitting on the chili.   I asked our server how hot the red sauce was for the pork.   She stated that if it wasn't quite hot enough, she could bring a hotter sauce, which she did.   The pork was flavorful, but it could have used more sauce.   The rice and beans and flour tortilla were average, typical I guess one could say.    I ordered a glass of their red wine.    Sorry.    I can't remember the name of it, and the wine list isn't posted so I can't access it.    It was $15/glass, and it was heavy bodied, just the way I like it.    I would go back, especially since it is conveniently located.    Is it outstanding?    No.    I wouldn't say so.
