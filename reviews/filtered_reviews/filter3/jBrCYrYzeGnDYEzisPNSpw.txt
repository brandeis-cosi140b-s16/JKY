Does "Los Reyes de la Torta" translate to "gut bomb?" Because that's what I got there. The food tasted good but man, did my stomach not like me for it.

The boyfriend and I ordered the mushroom queso and a torta to share (these things are huge). I would not order the queso again. I guess we just didn't know what it was. We expected a queso dip for chips. We got a plate full of melted cheese that I guess you put into tortillas. It was difficult to manage and just not really what we wanted.

The torta was tasty, I'll give 'em that. But honestly, it could have been better. We got one with pineapple and chipotle mayo. Could have used more of both. The mayo was almost non-existent. But there was plenty of meat so even though we shared one torta we were more than stuffed walking out of there. 

I would give it another shot but only if I was really, really hungry.
