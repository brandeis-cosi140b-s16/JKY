Fantastic place to take a visitor from out of town. The place is somewhat seasonal because you really should eat on the outside patio. It's definitely a fun atmosphere and the food is actually good (sometimes). I found the service to be nice as well - although they seem to frantically run around like chickens with their heads cut off not knowing what to do next. Their stress stresses me out. If you have kids, they'll love this as a treat and will probably remember it forever.

Their margaritas are average and their mexican food is actually shitty and 80s and standard. It's edible, but not good. Their American food is pretty good though. You're going to go here for the atmosphere - bringing you back to smoking jackets and hanging out in the den. If this review is confusing, let's just say I've had mixed results when visiting this place.
