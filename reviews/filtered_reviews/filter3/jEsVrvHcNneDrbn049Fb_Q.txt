I think Abuelos is very good for a chain Mexican food restaurant. They are pretty consistent with nice servers and decent food. I remember a time when there were huge lines out the door and hour long waits, but maybe that was in spring training season because the last time I visited, we got right in with a party of 6. I will go there again with out of town guests because they seem to love it but i prefer to frequent local establishments if I can.
