I went on a Saturday night and I got seated right away, and my server, LG, was very helpful about the menu and the wine selections.  Nobody ever said Mad Mex is Mexican or even Tex Mex, it's definitely California Mexican...and as long as you understand that, you will do better there.  Having said that, I don't think they have a very good Margarita (which should be tequila, triple sec or Cointreau, and fresh lime juice).  The food at Mad Mex tastes great and it's made from fresh ingredients.  The decor is consistent with the Mad Mex branding, and there's original artwork throughout the restaurant.  I love the high ceiling, the different seating options, and the huge open wall that faces Highland Ave.  This is by far my favorite of all the Mad Mex locations.
