First place I came on my first day in AZ and they served me the most disgusting Margarita- it tasted like cleaning products I told the sever the same and he looked at me like I was crazy and told me there was no way that was possible...So I chugged it and got a Corona!! The food was ok nothing special. The best part was sitting on the patio and drinking!
