I have alot of friends who live on campus, so yayo is a staple in our weekend routine. food is good, beer is good, its a great place to sit and drink and listen to local talent play thier music. the atmosphere is cozy and hip, but sometimes the other patrons can be a downer. the quinticential college hipster with the fake wayfarers sit outside drinking pbr and smoking cigarettes looking down thier noses at me and my friends can get on some peoples nerves. the staff is funny and friendly and always accomedating.  overall, fun place to hang out, dont let the other patrons ruin your good time here at yayo.
