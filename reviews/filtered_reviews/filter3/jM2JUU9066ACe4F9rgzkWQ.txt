Weird that there are no reviews since last July on this place???  I have been here many times as it is 10 mins away from my house.  I do like the location because you feel you are right out in the desert and the outdoor sitting is nice.  Inside in the main dining section can be VERY noisy if it is busy.  Lots of families and kids too sometimes.  I just went on a Friday night and had a decent experience.  They have live music some nights, which is nice but can just add to the noise level.  

The margaritas are very good.  Free salsa and chips are good.  Food can be a little hit or miss sometimes.  I usually get the Pollo Fundido and it has ranged from really good to okay on several occasions.  I think sometimes it is sitting under a heat lamp too long.  I did notice on this visit that the portion sizes have shrunk and the prices have remained the same, so I guess management finally have moved the way of many chain restaurants to squeeze more profits.  The food tends to be very salty.  Wait staff can be hit or miss too.  Friday night, the waitress was super busy and you could tell probably had too many tables but we got what we ordered in a fairly timely manner. Probably would give them 3.5 stars but that isn't an option on Yelp.

Will continue to go back.
