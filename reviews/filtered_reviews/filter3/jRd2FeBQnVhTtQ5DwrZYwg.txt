The person I went with had a lot of food allergies and the owner was very accommodating. She knew exactly what was in the food. Anyone with food allergies knows what a blessing it is when the chef/ owner knows everything about everything. A+ for that. 

Negatives:

It took 15 minutes just to understand the flippin' menu. If you're new, prepare to get ushered to the sample tray where you'll get a tutorial on how to fill out the order card (which still makes no sense), then you'll be herded back in line where you finally pay and order. It's overkill for a restaurant geared towards the lunch crowd. Hell, it's overkill for any restaurant! Ordering should never be that complicated.

I found everything to be too salty, over fatty, or over fried. The novelty of the place wasn't enough to make me enjoy the food. 

I figured the burrito would be a good bet because it takes a lot to mess that up. The owner recommended the black beans but unfortunately they came out runny. The taste and consistency was more of a dip or side dish than anything else. The beany-soupy burrito fell apart after one bite. Bummer! 

The side of rice was also equally as disappointing, as the rice seasonings weren't mixed. The bottom of the dish was just plain white rice and it had no taste. 

Even with all of that, because it's an interesting concept, the owners are accommodating, and most people LOVE the food (I'm sure I'm in the minority). If you're into a salty, greasy Mexican/Asian food, you can probably overlook the confusing ordering system and enjoy it.
