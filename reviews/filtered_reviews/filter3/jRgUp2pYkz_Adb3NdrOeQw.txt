Just OK. 
Went for lunch and decided to try one of their Lunch Specials. 
Green Chile Beef Burro. 
Their Chips are basic and a bit boring. Salsa was the same. 
The Burro was a bit of a sloppy mess and lacked flavor. The Beans were soupy and rice was just decent. 
Service was great. Not a place I'd go out of my way to go back to, but would consider giving it another try to see how they do on their other dishes. Nice little outdoor seating area.
