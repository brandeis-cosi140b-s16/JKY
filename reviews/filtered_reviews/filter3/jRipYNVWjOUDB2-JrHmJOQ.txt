We went here for lunch because we had seen a few good reviews, but I don't think it was as good as many people said it was.  

The food was ok, but nothing special. We go to Mexico and Hawaii fairly often and always get fish tacos, so our bar for tasty tacos is high. The tacos here were average. We also had the steak teriyaki and it was lackluster as well. The teriyaki sauce was runny and bland. 

On top of all that, the soda machine was out. Of course we didn't know that until we got our drinks and took a swig of water and soda syrup. Yuck! We told an employee walking by and they told us that they knew about it and were trying to fix it. About 20 minutes later, we hadn't seen anyone about the soda, even though we saw them bring in soda in cans they had bought for people to have, but i didn't see any of those passed out either. We couldn't ask them to give us one because we couldn't get anyone to come over to us. Everyone seemed to be running around crazy like. I would have hoped to get sodas since we paid for them, but we never did nor did we get a refund on them. Quite disappointing. 

When we were getting ready to leave, and quite thirsty, a little boy, maybe 10 and obviously the owner's kid, came by with a sweet treat for my daughter and gave us coupons to come back. He was nice and cute and redeemed the place a little, but we were so thirsty and annoyed at the service that we were over it.
