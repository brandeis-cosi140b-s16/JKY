Walked in and deafened by the loud music.  Let's say ordering food was a challenge.  We arrived just minutes before the lunch time rush began.  A very confusing process when ordering food.  Everyone was guessing where to begin.  Finally got our food and then proceeded to the salsa bar.  Now with the lunch time crowd piling in, getting to the salsa bar was impossible.  I would reccomend relocating it far from the confussing food ordering lines.  It became a mixed jumble of confusion and frustration for everyone.

I ordered 3 tacos and she ordered a salad, along with a couple of beers.  Very tasty, and the salsas were great.  Had to practically shout to converse, because of the music being pumped over the sound system.  They do not skimp on the guac, compared to Cafe Rio, where you get a tiny teaspoon scoop of guac.  Finished with the meal and a cold Stella, while watching and laughing in amazement at the other customers trying to figure out the maze of lines.  Would eat here again, but would advise to avoid the lunch time rush.

Place was clean and friendly service.  Food was authentic and tasty, but giving it 3 stars for the mass of confusion while ordering, and the overpowering thump of loud music.  This in turn.... caused every person in the joint to yell, just to converse..
