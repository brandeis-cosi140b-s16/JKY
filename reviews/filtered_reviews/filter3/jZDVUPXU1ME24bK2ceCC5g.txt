Overall good meal. Big portions and good price. I had the chicken tacos and my wife had the fish tacos. Both very good and both came with 3 tacos each and two sides. We could have shared a plate since we had the guacamole made right at the table. For sides, you must get the corn.

Now the drinks were another story. My wife and her friend tried the specialty drinks with most being $10. Definitely not worth it. 

Food is great. Get an appetizer, split a meal and get a dessert. Good locations, staff was very friendly. Overall good meal.
