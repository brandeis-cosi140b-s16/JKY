We stopped here after watching the excruciating Criss Angel Believe show, which is another story entirely. We were seated quickly, but the hostess and waiter kept going on about how we should have come here on Saturday because there is dancing and fun and non-stop tequila action and we really should have come on a different night. Well, do they want us to turn around and leave? Thanks for dashing our hopes for a wonderful evening. But we stayed, and the food was a lot better than expected. The salsa assortment was delicious, as were the fish tacos, although the portions a bit small. I expected, you know, El Torito-sized plates. In general, food was good, and T&T is a nice place to stop if you're already inside the Luxor. But don't go out of your way.
