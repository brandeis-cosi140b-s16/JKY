This place is adequate, and I like the huge iced teas, but the food is nothing special.  Everything is okay, and because it's so close I wound up eating at Tee Pee several times in the past few months-----but then I just stopped, because you can find better Senoran Mexican food than this.  The service is usually fantastic, and a lot of people must apparently like the vibe (bar?), but there are many mom and pop Mexican places in Phoenix that have superior flavors to this.  I've tried just about everything, but when you pay $11 and you just can't seem to find one menu item that rocks, you move on.
