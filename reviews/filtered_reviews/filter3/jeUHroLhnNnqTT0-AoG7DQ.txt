Go for the cocktails and the guacamole . The tuna belly guac and the spicy cucumber cocktail were both amazing . The tacos on the other hand were more of a let down . The tortillas were Meh, and it almost felt like they were trying to be too edgy and unique with the fusion flavors on the tacos so it was so much going on . We ordered a ton of food because we wanted to try everything  and they were all so heavy, they could even make the tacos smaller so people can experience more. If you have ever had tacos from the west coast these don't even compare . We also got the tres leches cake for dessert which tasted like one of those frozen boxed cakes, we had one bite and left it.
