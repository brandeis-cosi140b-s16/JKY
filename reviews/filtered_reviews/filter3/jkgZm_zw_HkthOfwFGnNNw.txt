Cabo Fish Taco is a pretty good place. Personally, I love the queso but the food has just never been flavorful enough for me. The flavors never really mesh together in a way that's like..."good GOD I HAVE to come back for this specific entree" Definitely a place to try out for yourself though! Although it may not be my cup of tea it may be yours!
