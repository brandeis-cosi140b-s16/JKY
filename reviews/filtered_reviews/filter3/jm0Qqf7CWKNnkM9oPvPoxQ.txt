This is definitely a place to sit out & have a few drinks with some chips and guacamole, but not a full meal. The food just isn't that good but the patio atmosphere definitely makes you want to drink. I had the Gringos Burrito and it was forgettable. Low quality rice without much flavor, mediocre red sauce, heavy refried beans, etc. I shared a cheese quesadilla with friends and it was also whatever. Barely any cheese so it was super thin, again forgettable. I'd definitely come back on a nice afternoon for beers & a snack, Dos Gringos does that wonderfully.
