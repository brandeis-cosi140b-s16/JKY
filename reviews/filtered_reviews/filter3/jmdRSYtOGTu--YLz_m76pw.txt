I wasn't expecting a whole lot here. Food is okay. I got the avocado tacos with lettuce wraps instead of tortillas and they were nothing to write home about. Maybe a bit over filled, so they were hard to eat.

Had a boring queso fundido skillet (vegetarian), and the cheese didn't even seem fully melted. Disappointing. Served with soft flour tortillas. Meh.

The one highlight for me was the house margarita. Simple and delicious. I slurped up the whole thing.

Ultimately, I can't say that you should come here, but if you do, prepare for an underwhelming experience.
