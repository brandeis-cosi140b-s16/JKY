Not sure where to eat dinner last night, we decided on one Mexican restaurant, instead though, we went to a place we keep driving past.

The interior is very bright and colorful, many decorations on shelves, an attractive wine cellar/vodka storage area adds to the room. We were seated almost immediately, and had drink orders in short order. Chips, salsa and bean dip came out straight away too.

The menus had us perplexed though, as prices were different on both of them. Drinks were listed as 0.00 on one, absolutely blank on the other. Refill prices were listed as $1.00 and $1.50 for special drinks, and some of the food was inconsistently priced too.

Their menu offers a wide variety (almost too much!) of combination plates, dinner platters and a la carte items. The prices were a little on the high side for Mexican food, but it smelled so good, we stuck it out. 

Our server is one of those that tries to remember your order, without writing it down. I say try, because he forgot what my wife had ordered by the time he finished inputting my meal.

We were surprised when soup was brought out after the orders were input. It was a tomato based soup with some form of pasta, was pretty flavorful, but nothing mind blowing.

Our food came out, we both looked at each other and wondered how we would eat so much food. However, her steak was not worth $15.99 for the plate. My combination was good, yet lacking in some flavor. 

I had the #6 - chicken tostada, enchilada and taco. The taco was not greasy so much, as it almost seemed watery. It was an odd flavor, and the taco shell was falling apart as I attempted to eat it.

We will give this place a shot again, and will go for some other plates, and not fill up on chips and salsa before, which was good, if not a touch spicy. Personally, I prefer a chunky salsa, and would have enjoyed it more if that was offered too.
