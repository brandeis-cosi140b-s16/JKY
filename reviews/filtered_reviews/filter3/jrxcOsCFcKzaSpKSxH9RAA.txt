Had alot of fun here.

Yes it is overpriced like everything on the strip.  The food is just ok, but definitely not bad.

But it was a cool place to relax. If you become friends with the bartenders at the outside bar it is quite fun. They seem to have great convo's from everything from how to make drinks, to relationships, to Vaginal Flatulence.

Definitely Good Times.
