Diablo's served my first ever Vegas drink. Again, this was a restaurant but they have bars throughout for enjoying a margarita. The vibe was borderline hard rock, hardcore, but the people were mostly tourists and plenty of party people walked in and out. Margaritas were about $10, and the staff is friendly. Will have to try to food and update next time.
