Stopped in for lunch before hopping in my car to head back to L.A. The entrance and atmosphere screams come in and take a seat! haha

The staff is friendly and asked if I had any questions regarding the menu. I knew what I was coming for so I ordered right away. The food arrived fast and I can say it was decent. The portion was large for the cost and filled up both me and a friend leaving us to take home leftovers. I've had better Mexican food by far but the service, fast pace and food is enough to round up my rating to three stars. Would be three and a half if that ever becomes possible.
