I was soooo excited to come to Verde! Until... We were waited on....

My four friends and I decided to visit Verde (instead of Seviche) for happy hour on a Tuesday night. The place was mostly empty at 6:30pm, and it stayed that way for the remainder of the evening. After our whole party was there, we were provided with menus. After we decided what to order to drink, 20 minutes passed before our waitress came back. It took an additional 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive, and 15 more minutes for the waitress to take our food orders... I'm not an impatient girl by any means, but when a place is pretty much dead... That is unacceptable. Our waitress also took food orders of a party of 5 that came 30 minutes after our party arrived...

The food made up for the service, but that doesn't amend it. I had the 3 tacos. One was mahi, one was chicken, and the other was shrimp. I wasn't wild about the chicken (tasteless and tough), but the others were delicious! The white rice and black bean side was also very good. I even tried the aphrodisiac tequila flight... If you are a tequila expert, I would recommend trying one of their flights. If you're not (like me), be ready to get hammered with a few whiffs... Lol

I would definitely give this place another shot, but the service could be improved drastically...
