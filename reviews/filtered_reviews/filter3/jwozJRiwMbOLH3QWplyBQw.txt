Edit: The manager came over and fixed the situation. Still wouldn't order a cocktail but cool that they refunded the second set of kettle.

Don't order a cocktail. Major ripoff. $9 for kettle and soda that was so weak that we ordered a second shot and it cost another $9. Basically you'll pay $18 for a very weak drink. Go across the street to HiFi...
