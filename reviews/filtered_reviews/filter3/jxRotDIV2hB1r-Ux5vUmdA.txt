Lots of my friends really like this place . Parking was difficult to find . Had to park a behind and go thru the alley .prices were  high compared to most other mexican restaurants.  I did like their guacamole and chips . I had their green chili which was  disappointing . The meat was dry and not very spicy . I did like e the whole beans .. I would not rank this as one of the best mexican restaurant in town . Service was also slow
