It had been a couple years since our last visit and was throughly disappointed in the food this time. I ordered the chicken tacos el carbon and all they tacos had in them was flavorless chicken and cabbage, I had to drown them in salsa to make them edible the beans and rice had the most flavor on the plate. My wife ordered the nachos and it was a giant pizza pan of meat, cheese, chips, and grease. For 15.00 I would have at least expected a little bit of beans and maybe some sour cream or guacamole on the side but nope that was all extra. 

The best part of the food was the kids meals but you really can't screw up a bean burrito and mini chimis.  Although the food was bad the service was good and the staff that we encountered were very nice and great with our kids.
