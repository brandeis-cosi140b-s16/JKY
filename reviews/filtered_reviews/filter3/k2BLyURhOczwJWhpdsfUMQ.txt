Frank and Fina's Cocina has a very good atmosphere in a very nice location.  The staff wasn't very friendly, but they weren't rude either.  

The chips were good, light with a very satisfying crunch.  I found the salsa to be good, but not great.  It was simple and plain, with no spice.

I ordered the carnitas burrito, while my friend ordered the ropa vieja.  My burrito was, once again, good but not great.  He said he enjoyed his dish.  Nothing was over or undercooked, but everything seemed to be missing an extra kick.  I could understand where people would like this, but it wasn't up to my palate.

We finished the meal with fried ice cream, I've had better before, but it was still yummy.

Worth the try, but wouldn't go again. Sorry Frank and Fina!
