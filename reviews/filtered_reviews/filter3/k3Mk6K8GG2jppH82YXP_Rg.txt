This is the cutest place ever.  I will start by saying the food,  awesome!!! .  I attended the place for a group luncheon for about 50 people.  The organization of service sucked and they seemed to be unprepared for the party.  Many people food, including mine, came out after most were finished eating (but the food was good). Besides the clueslessness of handling a large group, the place is cute and the food is so good.  The Guacamole is to die for.
