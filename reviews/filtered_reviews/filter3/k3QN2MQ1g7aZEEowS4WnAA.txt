I know I'm going to hear crap for only giving this place 3 stars. The food here is outstanding!!!! But service, that's a completely different story. Been here about 3 times and have had not so great service every single time. 
First time, made the mistake of coming during lunch time. Wait was about 45 minutes but luckily I had nothing planned after and was looking forward to trying a new place. After almost an hour we finally had a table. And after 30 minutes, finally got our food. It was very busy so I understand the wait. Second time, I called in my order since I only had 30 minutes for lunch. Said it would be ready in 20. Got there, still had to wait 20 minutes for my food. The order had not even been started yet. Third visit, came here today with my boss. Came around 1:30 after the lunch rush. They weren't very busy but we felt like they were rushing us to get out. There wasn't even anyone waiting for a table. So yeah, long story short...service is lacking. They have picked up on hiring extra staff which is good. 
On the other hand, food is amazing!!!! The bulgogi burrito is my #1 choice. The mix of Korean and Mexican flavors all rolled into one is mind blowing!!! This is probably what unicorns eat since it's super amazing. If you're feeling like a health nut, they offer the same taste in a lettuce taco. Not really healthy if you eat 4 of them though. The portions are huge and the price is affordable! Since I'm close by, I will be back.
