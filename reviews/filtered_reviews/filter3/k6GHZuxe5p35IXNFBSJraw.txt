Seemingly average to good Mexican fare in a cool setting, worthy of a visit for an out of towner. 

Lunch specials are affordable and portions are plentiful. The servers were friendly and attentive, sure to keep my glass filled and the chips coming.  The chips are perfect...warm and crisp and the salsas were great.  

I sampled beef taco and enchilada.  I'd say this was the first taco I've had that I truly enjoyed.  The chili relleno was not the best I've ever had, but was decent.  

If you have the itch for Mexican in a cool, memorable setting, swing by!
