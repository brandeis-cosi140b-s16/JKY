Food, really great.  Service, good. Atmosphere....great looking place, but not a really fun atmosphere.  Been here twice, Friday happy hour and a Wednesday dinner.  Friday at the bar was mildly busy, good bartenders.  Wednesday was dead, but food was great.  Great place to hit before going out to Scottsdale. Will be back, but not a sports, dance, bar type of place.  Drinks a bit pricy.  Margarita and a "specialty" drink, $18...on happy hour pricing.  A bit high....
