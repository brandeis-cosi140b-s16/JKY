The atmosphere is beautiful..contemporary art,  beautiful exterior, and perfect lighting.  Unfortunately,  in an area like Scottsdale, which is known for it's fabulous restaurants,  the food was just meh.  The service also wasn't what you would expect for a restaurant in this price range. The place was almost empty, which should have told us something.
