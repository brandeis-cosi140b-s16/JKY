Well, due to aborting my date after drinks and before ordering any food, I can really only review the beverages. The raspado at 7 bucks was great tasting with tequilla, grapefruit juice and club soda i think. One of the better crafted mixed drinks and the ill-fated date had a glass of wine. The chips came with two kinds of salsa and i would give the nod to the green one which was avocado based. Chips were regular and did not stand out. As for food, items hovered about 12 bucks, but will have to try that next time on a date that can actually make it through the dinner ordering process.
