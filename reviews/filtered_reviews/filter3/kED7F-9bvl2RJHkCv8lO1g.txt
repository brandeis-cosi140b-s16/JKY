The host was a little bitch....telling me that she needed to get past me....well if she paid a little bit of attention she would've noticed that i had nowhere to move bc i was letting her customers get past me...as to the food, it was good i ordered some chimichanga or.something that had white cheese on it...either way it was good ...the set-up of the tables sucks....feels like an overcrowded military cafeteria, not a restaurant
