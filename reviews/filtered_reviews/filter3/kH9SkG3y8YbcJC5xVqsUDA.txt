Had appetizer $8 Pork Tostadas' Delicious! not much one can say about mexican fare, same 6 ingredients just arranged differently and called something else. We ate at happy hour and bloody mary's were $8.75. Went there to kill time while our flight was delayed. No reason I can think of to return. Great service however. Was lucky to find parking. On the sunny side of the street at 108 degrees one might argue that isn't lucky.
