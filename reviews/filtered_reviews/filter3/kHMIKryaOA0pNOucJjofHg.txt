I went here with a buddy of mine on a workday lunch break. I must admit, my expectations were low, so I was overall happy with the experience. I had the spicy pork combo (sandwich and fries) and a Horchata to drink. A quick, fast foody type place, but much better than a burger king or carls for a lunch break. I'll be back, but I noticed the location closest to my house on 40th st has been closed.
