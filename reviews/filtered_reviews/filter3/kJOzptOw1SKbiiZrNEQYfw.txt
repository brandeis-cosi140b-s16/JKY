I was excited about eating here after having a great experience at the San Tan location a couple of months ago.  This time I was left under whelmed.  While our waiter was very enthusiastic, it didn't translate into the food.  The tableside guacmole was pretty bland as was my crab enchiladas.  The Fajitas one of my lunch partners ordered was very good, at least the steak was, avoid the chicken.  Maybe I wasn't hungry enough or they are having an off day, either day, it wasn't quite as good.
