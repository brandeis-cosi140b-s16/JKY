So I constantly heard people talking about how amazing this taco shop is, and I had to try it. The lines are outrageous, and it is set up as a cafeteria style where you stand in line, get your food & then you pay. The taste of the tacos were absolutely amazing, however, I paid $2 for a  taco about the size of my hand. After eating 2 of them, & an order of fries, I couldn't honestly say I was full. Overall, would rate as average.
