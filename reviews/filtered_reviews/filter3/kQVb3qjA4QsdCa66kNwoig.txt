Tried Chino for the first time today. I was craving something really flavorful and "dirty", and through recommendation of a friend wound up here. 

I ordered the Jade Red Chicken bowl with Pork Fried Rice. All I can say is "Meh, it was alright". The chicken was pretty good, although it left a terrible aftertaste in my mouth (I'm still tasting it 3 hours later). The rice was alright - a little too salty in my opinion. 

Service was quick and excellent. Being a first timer, they gladly offered me a sample and helped me fill out my order form. 

I'm still a little unsure about it, but wouldn't mind returning to try some different items.
