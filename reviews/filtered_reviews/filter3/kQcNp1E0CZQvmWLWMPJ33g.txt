Went to Carolina's for dinner. We love their mini chimis. I ordered the beef mini chimis w/ rice & beans, no guac or garnish, and sour cream on the side. My boyfriend got the same thing except chicken. The place was very busy. It was funny waiting for our number to be called because they'd call a number before ours, then a number after, then another number before, etc. We were bound to come up sometime! :) And then ours was ready. They got the order exactly right. We split our beef & chicken so we could have both. I liked the beef a lot more than the chicken, personally. The chicken tasted too much like dark meat. The shredded beef was moist & tasty. Crispy, fried exterior... Yum yum! The rice & beans are nothing special... Could use more seasoning. Go to Valle Luna for good rice & beans. But the chimis here are great! And they have yummy tortillas too. Though it's not the cleanest place I've been to... there was a lot of hot sauce spilled on the floor. =/
