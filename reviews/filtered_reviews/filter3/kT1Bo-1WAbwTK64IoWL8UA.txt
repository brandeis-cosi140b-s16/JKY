The food is great!  One of my favorite Mexican restaurants.  I've been going there since it opened.  That being said with the exception of one newer waiter, the staff is rather unwelcoming and unfriendly. If the food were not so good I'd never go back.  If you don't mind bad treatment the food is great!
