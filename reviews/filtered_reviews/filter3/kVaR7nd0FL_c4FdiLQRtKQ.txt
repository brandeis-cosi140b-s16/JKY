Got a take out order which was prepared promptly.  I chose fried shrimp tacos which I were good but only had 4 smaller shrimp in them each.  I picked my side as pasta salad and while I typically love hot food this side was too spicy for me.   I might give it another shot for mahi mahi, I'd also like to see option of mixing up selections and buying more than just 2.
