The food is delicious fast mexican, the service is friendly, but you'd have to be blind not to think the signage detracts from Revo's otherwise quite pleasant esthetic. If the menu is on televisions, why not put changes up there where they belong? Seems like the point of going to the expense would be so I don't need a little tent on my table telling me that yes, you do now offer burritos "enchilada style."
