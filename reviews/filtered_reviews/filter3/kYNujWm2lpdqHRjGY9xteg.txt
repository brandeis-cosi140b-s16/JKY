I wanted to check out this place due to the high ratings and some of my friends have mentioned that they like this place a lot. As most Mexican restaurants do, they offer chips and salsa. They also offer bean dip, grilled jalapeños, and grilled onions. I really liked their bean dip and that they offer the grilled jalapeños.

We ordered the carne and carnitas fajitas for two people. It was enough for three people. It was alright but nothing spectacular that I would come back for. The service was great and attentive. The restaurant is huge with a nice patio. I would come back for their chips, bean dip, and grilled jalapeños and try something else.
