We went for a change of pace for happy hour. Kind of pretentious for what you get. Sat in the patio which was nice, although the birds were a bit aggressive. 

Overall my biggest problems were:
1) Margaritas menu doesn't have prices on it, but the waiter casually mentions one costs $30. I really do like to know the cost ahead of time.
2) Nothing (& keep in mind I got three menus) said that starters were 1/2 price for happy hour until we got the bill.

Other than those two things, the evening was fine, certainly not spectacular.  Those two things,however,  were irritating enough to mark this place down from a 4 to a 3.
