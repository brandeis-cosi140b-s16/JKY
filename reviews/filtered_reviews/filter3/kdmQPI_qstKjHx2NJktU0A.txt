I sit here writing this review trying to remember my time here.  I was at Sammy's for a bachelor party and by this time, I was pretty gone.  I do remember having a pretty potent margarita and somebody ordered some nachos.  Having consumed distilled beverages for about 12 hours at this point, I can honestly say that if they put out stale chips and week old movie-cheese, I would have downed it all in a heartbeat.  The place was lit up like a Christmas tree and people seemed to be having a good time.  You should check it out, cause in Vegas, never know what is going to happen.
