Decided to give Three Amigos a try after a certain amount of recommendations and reviews about the place. I visited on a Tuesday night with my friend and surprised at how small the place is! It's a true hole-in-the-wall Mexican restaurant.

We ordered the (small) house margarita and I found it to be a bit bland. I didn't get much flavor or 'oomph' from the drink. I've definitely had better margaritas. 
We were given the standard complimentary salsa and chips and I ordered a small portion of the guacamole. The salsa? VERY good and the chips were slightly seasoned which provided a nice flavor. The guac was good, it tasted very fresh but nothing else that was of note to remark about.

I ordered the enchiladas de horno (chicken enchiladas with cheese, onions, cilantro and avocado) which came with re-fried beans and rice. I loved the portion size of the enchiladas. They weren't your standard oversized portion found at other Mexican spots. My biggest problem with the meal was that parts of the rice was overcooked. Like, crunchy bits of rice which is a big downgrade for me.

I've had better Mexican food but I'd definitely give Three Amigos another try!
