This restaurant is very upscale in terms of menu and dcor.  We started off with a matched set of margaritas, the usual chips and salsa, and mini empanadas with roasted ancho chicken in white corn pouches accompanied by a spicy sauce.  I ordered the shrimp Belize  (6 shrimp with caramelized onions, peppers, avocado and lime) while My wife chose the margarita scallops (5 pan fried scallops finished in tequila, mango and mint salsa). Our dishes included the obligatory refried beans and rice.  We concluded the meal with bread pudding and a Kahluha flan.  The bread pudding was was too heavy, but  everything was pretty good though pricey.
