Hussong's is a convenient Mexican joint if you're staying at Mandalay.  Living in SoCal, there are so many wonderful Mexican restaurants to choose from and put Hussong's to shame.

I ordered the shrimp fajitas - the service was slow, but when the fajitas finally came out they were okay.  Nothing to write home about.  If you're looking for something less fancy, I would check it out.  Otherwise, there are much better options around the area.
