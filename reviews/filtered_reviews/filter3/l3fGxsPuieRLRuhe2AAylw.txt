The food here is great! I always get the mini chimis and love them. The salsas and bean dip are always really good. The only thing that kinda turns me off is how everytime I walk in I'm not greeted. I always end up standing there while the employees are either walking by or looking over at us. Kinda awkward. But besides that the staff is friendly!
