We hit this place on a Saturday morning when the airport was crazy busy. It seemed to my wife and I that the restaurant was under staffed to handle to nearly full dining area. We had eaten lunch here before so we thought we would try it for breakfast.

The service was very slow due to the crowd but our server was very friendly. The food is not bad, considering you are eating at the airport. If you are looking for great Mexican food, this ain't it but, again, you are at the airport! It won't hurt you, so give it a try if you have some spare time before your flight.
