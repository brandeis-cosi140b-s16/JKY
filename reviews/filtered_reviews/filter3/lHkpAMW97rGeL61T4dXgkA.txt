I'll give 3 stars because everyone was just so nice, but honestly it was just not the place for me.  House margaritas were good, and the salsa was very flavorful, but it seems like every single menu item is spicy and that doesn't work for me.  For some reason I asked after I placed my fajita order if they were spicy and was told oh yes, very!  Umm, no thanks then.  Switched to shrimp tacos, please no cilantro.  Of course they come loaded with cilantro and I have to pick it all out of the wet cabbage.  My friend got quesadilla as another less spicy option and they were served taco style, weird.  I am glad I gave it a shot but the only reason I'd be back is to have a margarita while I wait for a table at Cowfish!
