First impression: RuRu's has a beautiful location, a lovely outdoor patio, and a wonderfully unique TexMex menu. 

My husband and I walked from a nearby wine tasting Fri evening to check out RuRu's for our first time. There was a fairly long wait, but we didn't have to wait as long as expected. 

The cocktail menu looked fun and beer menu wasn't too bad - there was a small selection of local drafts...would love to see more local craft options for sure. 

For dinner, my husband opted for a burrito covered in queso and I ordered a strip steak and grilled mahi taco with a side of the creamy white beans. The food arrived quite quickly and looked great. As far as actual taste/quality/value, I was disappointed. The steak was rather tough, the tortillas were nothing unique and the contents of the tacos didn't quite fill them enough. The beans were tasty for sure and I can see why they are so popular. 

Anyways, cool place and definitely worth a visit, but I think I'll stick with Paco's Tacos for their brisket tacos and Cabo Fish Taco for their delish fish tacos.
