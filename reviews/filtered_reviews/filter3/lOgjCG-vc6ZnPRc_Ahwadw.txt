We stayed at the HRH and came down for a late dinner on Saturday 8/10.  The place was pretty empty at 10:30pm.  No real vibe.  Server was very pleasant and engaging.  Drinks were brought out right away.  Chips and salsa followed.  The Salsa was very good.  I ended up pouring that on my tacos.  I opted for the Taco al Carbon (steak).  The plate came out with 3 small tacos, beans, and rice.  The flavor was pretty straight forward.  Nothing spectacular at all.  I have had better taco from the "taco lady" that we have had come to our parties to cater.  The other people in our group opted for the steak enchilada and fish tacos.  No one really raved about the food at all.  So not sure what the hype is all about.  Would probably not bother to try it again.
