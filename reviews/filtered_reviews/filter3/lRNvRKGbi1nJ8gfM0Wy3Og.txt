I got the country fried burger and the wife got a BBQ bacon burger. We got fries and French toast fries. The service was good, but the food was... Meh. The burgers were smaller than expected and the patties seemed like they had been sitting for awhile. The French fries also tasted like they've been sitting. If we go back it will only be for the French toast fries which were pretty good. Overall it was mediocre at best. Won't be back for a burger.
