Great food and great specials on 1-2-3 night. Margaritas were delicious but hard to drink more than one because the mix was too sour. Asked the waiter several times to turn the music down so we could converse at our table but he never did, not sure if that was his fault or restaurant policy but eventually had to move to the back of the restaurant to be able to carry on a conversation. Otherwise the service wasn't bad. Would go back here but not my #1 montford spot.
