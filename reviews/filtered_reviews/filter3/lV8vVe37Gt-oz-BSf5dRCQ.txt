Came here with a group of 6 last weekend for dinner. Service was pretty decent. 

I'm only slightly familiar with the work of the two chefs, Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger. Kudos to the duo for creativity of the dishes and the thorough knowledge of the waitstaff. They serve warm and crispy chips and 3 kinds of salsas; all unique and good. We started with an order of the guacamole, which was pretty standard. Nothing really stood out with the order and it was a tad bland. 

For my main course, I ordered the Yucatan Pork ($24). It was a good-sized plate; price wasn't great but wasn't bad for restaurants on the strip. The pork itself was tender, but the flavor was just OK for me. There is a pretty heavy cinnamon flavor, which I found bright, surprising, and interesting, but that's really all I could taste. I think the dish was slightly bland and could have had a bigger variety of flavors. The rice and beans were very standard and uninteresting. I was a fan of the plantains that came with the dish, though. 

Overall, just an OK experience for me. I would definitely be open to revisiting and trying some of the other dishes, as a lot of them sounded interesting and creative.
