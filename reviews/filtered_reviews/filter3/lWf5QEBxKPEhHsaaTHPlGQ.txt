Tried Si Senor for the first time last night. Our experience was just okay. We were seated right away but it took at least ten minutes before our waitress came to our table. Once she had served our drinks service did improve a little bit but it was only so so. The chips are served with four different dipping sauces. One is a hot red salsa, one is a sour cream type of sauce, one is a bean dip and one is like a verde pork sauce that is served hot. I enjoyed the hot red salsa and the sour cream sauce but I didn't care for the verde pork sauce.

I ordered a combination plate which included a cheese enchilada, a crunchy taco, a flauta and chili con carne all smothered in red enchilada sauce. The enchilada sauce was delicious. Spicy and tasted home made. I did enjoy the enchilada very much as well as the crunchy beef taco. My fianc√© tried the two bean and cheese burritos smothered in the red enchilada sauce and these were very good as well. The beans here taste very fresh and creamy. The Mexican rice here is also very good. So overall the food was good and I would definitely come back for cheese enchiladas in red sauce. We were also served sopapillas at the end of the meal which were delicious and you can get them covered in cinnamon. Good value for the price.

The reason for three stars is partially because of the service and partially because of the ambiance. I do not mind an older restaurant that is showing some age as long as it is clean and taken care of. The table we were seated at had a big stain of red sauce directly in front of me on the table cloth. I also observed many dusty areas along the hallway leading to the kitchen which always makes me worry. Note to management, just take a little more time to clean at the end of the day it makes a big difference! Other than that pretty good experience. Food is good. Return factor 60%
