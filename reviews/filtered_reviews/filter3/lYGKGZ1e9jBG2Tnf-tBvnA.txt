I am upgrading this review from 2 stars to 3, because I had a bad service experience at El Segundo Sol in Las Vegas (the food and drinks were amazing) and I got a call from the manager after the owner got back to me after seeing my review. 

Ross Buter who is the manager offered me a free meal there, but he wouldn't be in on the day we would have gone in, but since it was our first time in Vegas, me and the wife didn't want to repeat restaurant on this trip. Thus Ross offered me a certificate (without an expiration date) to eat at any Lettuce Entertain You Restaurants' establishment. 

That was a really kind gesture and as promised I received that letter in the mail with two gift certificates totaling $50. So I plan on definitely visiting an establishment and will 100% be going back to El Segundo Sol on my next trip to Vegas which will be rather soon. 

I'll be updating this review again and possibly another Lettuce establishment in the near future.
