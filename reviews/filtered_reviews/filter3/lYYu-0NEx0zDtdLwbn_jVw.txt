The food here was really good. It was filling and tasty. However, when compared to other taco joints or mexican food, it is just very average. I love mexican food and the food here lacks the authenticity of other places... But this should be obvious since its in a casino. 
My problem is that they are very very pricey. For two people, it was $54. The food was good and it was discounted for gamblers, but if I had to pay over $50 for the quality I would be upset.
Definetly people should come here and try it out, just know the quality isn't worth the price.
