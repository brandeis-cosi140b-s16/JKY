Ok...I am upping to 3 stars here for a few reasons. 

First, here I am thinking...um, 3 year old in tow...umm, guess that means FnB, Bourbon Steak, Petite Maison, etc...are all out. Great, did I have to say I was an expert at finding places to eat. Hmmm...aha! Carlsbad Tavern. 

Why? Water and lights, all in one, mesmerizing. Even to me. Plus, You and or said child can be relatively loud outside without bothering anyone. Aside from fears of people going into the water, it works well. 

Add to that, the service was good, even courteous, despite a dish mix-up that almost led to crying...by an adult. 

I still think the menu is a bit too large and varied, and the New Mexican items can get lost, but it is decent place to please all ages on an outdoor patio.
