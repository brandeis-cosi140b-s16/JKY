Went here on October 15th for a 30-year class reunion social (drinks & pre-ordered munchies).

The waitresses were efficient and attentive beer-slingers, and the food wasn't bad.

The band that was playing when a group of us got there (around 7:30pm) played way too loudly, and was way too average (bleh, in other words).  It might not have been so bad had we not been trying to catch up with one another....and if they weren't playing like they were headlining a concert.
