I really have to say that my experience was just okay.  I walked in the wrong way and got ovewhelmed.  There are 2 doors, one is for the bar and one for the restaurant.  Because it was so crowded everywhere we couldn't figure out what door we needed to enter.  We finally got inside and seated in the presidential room.    The doorways and rooms are so tight and clausterphobic.  Everytime I needed something I would have to flag down the waitress and I felt like we were bugging her.  The food was just okay.  I ordered the veggie burrito that I liked but would just get it from the take out window next time where it is even cheaper than inside the restaurant.
