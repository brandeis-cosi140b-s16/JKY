This place was decent.  My work had a holiday party on the porch, well more of a holiday get together.  Regardless, we had some drinks, chips and dip, and tacos.  Overall the service was decent.  The waitress did take a drink order and forgot.  No big deal.  The tacos were great other then the carne asada taco.  It was overloaded with cabbage, and was lackluster in flavor.  I'd recommend the brisket, they were amazing!  I would definitely go back again.
