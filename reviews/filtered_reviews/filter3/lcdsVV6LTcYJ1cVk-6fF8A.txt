Talk about a restaurant that's described by their name. I've driven by this area multiple times and never seen this place. Thought I should bring my mom here since we both enjoy seafood and Mexican food. Usually we'll go to the Islitas restaurant for seafood, but I saw the reviews here thought we should give it a shot. 

First it's located in a sketchy area. It's noted it opens at 10:30, but it was locked they didn't open till 11. The other stores around there are kinda old and beat. As you walk in it's pretty small the waitress quickly attended us. My mom order a coke bottle they didn't have it, my first choice was a tamarind flavored jarritos soda turns out they didn't have that lol. The oysters we ordered had this water flavor instead of the normal oyster flavor. The shrimp cocktail I had was good had a lot of shrimp. My mom had the carne molcajete which comes with chicken, beef, chorizo, cheese, beans, and grilled cactus. She said it ok but the beef and chicken were so seasoned it came out salty.
