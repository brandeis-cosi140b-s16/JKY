Finally made it and have to say I wasn't truly impressed.  I got one of the tuna tacos with refried beans.  The beans were lukewarm.  Took awhile to get our drinks.  I wasn't impressed with their chips either, needed some salt and some seemed stale. The music was alittle too loud as to where we couldn't hear the waitress and she couldn't hear us.  Dont get me wrong, I"d give it another try but only if I'm in the area, I wouldn't make a special trip.
