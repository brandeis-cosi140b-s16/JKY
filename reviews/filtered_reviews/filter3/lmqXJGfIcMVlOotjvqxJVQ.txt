While some people swear by this place I cannot.  The food is decent clean New Mexican fare that is very average.  The restaurant itself is clean and is considered sit down fast food.  The price point is just right with meals between $5-$10 and free chips and salsa (Chipotle should note this!)  3.5 out of 5 stars for fair priced clean quasi Mexican cuisine.   I will stick to Polliberto's for Mexican food.
