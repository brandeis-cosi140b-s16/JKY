This past week we came here twice, once for dinner - and the second time was for late night tequila shots. For dinner, we were able to get a spot on the patio, overlooking the strip - great spot to people watch! Beers were overpriced, and undersized (so were the margaritas).. but the food is good. Order the fajitas, which can be split between two people (around $20) and you both will be full. There is karoake inside too until late night, so end the night perhaps with tequila and singing?
