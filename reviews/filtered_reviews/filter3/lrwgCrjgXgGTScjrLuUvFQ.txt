I keep forgetting that Lawrenceville is the new hipster hangout so I was somewhat unprepared for my Round Corner Cantina experience.  I met a friend around 9pm on a Thursday night thinking we would have no problem with crowds.  Big mistake.  After squeezing my car into the last open parking spot within a 5 block radius, we made our way inside.  The place was packed.  I was hoping to lounge outside, enjoy a few drinks and the lovely weather, catch up on current events....it was not to be.  Instead we settled for one of the last tables inside.

The service, while not the quickest, wasn't a complete disappointment considering how busy the place was.  The chips and salsa were some of the best I've ever had - which they should be for the price.  We also ordered tacos - my friend got the mahi mahi tacos, I the hanger steak tacos.  $7.50 for just two tacos seemed a little steep, but they were darn good.  The beer and cocktail menu has lots of options.  One of our biggest likes was the music - lots of great songs I hadn't heard in awhile.

I don't know that I was necessarily impressed with my whole Round Corner Cantina adventure, but I will probably be back.  Just not when I'm in a hurry.
