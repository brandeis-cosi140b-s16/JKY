The service was excellent, the restaurant is beautiful, the salsa and table side guacamole were delicious, the food (well what both my mom and I ordered) is left to be desired. My mom ordered the mahi mahi tacos and I ordered the barbacoa tacos. Both were dripping with oil and just very greasy. I don't think I'll go back for that reason. Very disappointing as I had high hopes for this restaurant because of the great yelp reviews. Oh well, you don't know unless you try.
