I love tacos. They are my favorite go to. My husband loves burritos. So when my brother brought our family here after his ravings, we thought it could become one of our go-to's. The decor and ambience was rustic urban with good music. Service was good as I ordered a taco that has some bitter saut√©ed arugula on it that made me gag and they let me trade it for another. My husband loved his shrimp burro while my tacos were overly flavored and dressed. I probably would've liked the street tacos better that have more similar flavors. I would recommend La Santisima for the free salsa bar and better tacos.
