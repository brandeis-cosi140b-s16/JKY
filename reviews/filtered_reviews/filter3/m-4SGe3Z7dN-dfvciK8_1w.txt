Pros- as far as I can tell this is authentic New Mexican chili they serve here and its pretty tasty. 
Cheap beer and margaritas served here
Overall the portion sizes are very generous
Prices are very good for what you get on the food as well

Cons-
Place is filthy and as the years go by a lack in pride of ownership is starting to show
Very cramped with a poor layout. Its always uncomfortable to navigate your way past diners and ppl getting self serve fountain drinks as you make your way back to order. They need to rearrange that place because when busy its a nightmare to dine in
Food quality has dimisnished in my opinion over the last 3 years.
