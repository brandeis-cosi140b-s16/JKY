Pink Taco is ok. Our server was really nice and helpful! Always filled our glass without us asking. Only thing I have to whine about is the quality of the food, and pricing. Obviously to me, I feel that there is some sort of unwritten rule that says "the ratio of good quality food must be equivalent to the price". I feel that this ratio is a bit off where it leans more towards a high price/ low grade food quality ratio.

We got a $12 pomegranate Margarita which was of course had that big round house tequila kick to the face! But that's a given...its a margarita.

$5.99 Fried Fried Ice Cream- Don't be fooled. It a big scoop of ice cream in a generic, but fancy looking ice cream cone cup. I mean I'd be sold on it if it had some sugar and cinnamon "churro" like seasoning to it, but it was plain. Then the choco syrup had some weird taste to it. Like it was spiked with alchy. I'm all for spiked drinks, but spiked syrup? Nay..

$12.99 Baja Fish Tacos- SUPER SMALL PORTIONS! The fish slices WERE SMALL! I felt like they must have gone through some serious cut backs since the BP oil spill. I mean it's like they killed their pet goldfish and served it to me in a tortilla (poor goldfsh!!!!!)

$8.99 Chicken Skewers- Thumbs up to tenderness...but my sister wasn't too happy to find  nicely redish pink center to it. SMH.

Service is nice. The restaurant decor is fun and festive, but food is just not worth it. Thankfully the awesome Yelpers on here knows where the REAL tacos are!!
