Good food! I have enjoyed all their tacos and their 20 vegetable fried rice. I have also enjoyed their chilaquiles. They don't seem to get the idea of "well done" fried egg. I did have to return it three times. I finally just gave up! Drinks are pricey. I mean $6 for a tiny ginger ale! Food is also a bit pricey but I have enjoyed it every time I have been there. Will go back in the future.
