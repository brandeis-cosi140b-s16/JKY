We wanted something fast in Vegas to eat before our show....so we decided to stop here. There were 11 of us and I personally wasn't a big fan of my meal...I had a chicken burrito..it was just blah...needed more flavor. I did like the queso...good queso!!

A couple of us got the maragaritas and they were fresh and great!!
