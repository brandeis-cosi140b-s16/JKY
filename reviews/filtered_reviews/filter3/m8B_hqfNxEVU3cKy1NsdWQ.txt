Though the service was pretty good, the food was just alright. The place is pretty dark inside and our table didn't have a light over or near it so we were unable to really see what we were eating. Nothing stood out as being particularly delicious - though I will say the Pozole was pretty good. They're "hatch" style is not as hot as I expected (unless of course you eat the chilis themselves!).

Overall just a-ok...
