I was one of six in a group.  The waitress basically stood over me until I ordered.  My friend joined us a little while later and she drank one of our waters.  The waitress never came back to check on us :/  She  left plates and trash on the table until I asked her to take them.  The food wasn't the best I've had there either!  I will definitely go again because of previous experiences that were positive.  Hopefully, the next time the service will be stellar and the food delicious!
