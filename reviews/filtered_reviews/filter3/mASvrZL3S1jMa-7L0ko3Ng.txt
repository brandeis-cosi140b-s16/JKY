This place was ok. It was recommended to us from a friend who knows authentic mexican cuisine. When you first arrive they bring you out chips and 3 different types of salsa (green, spicy red, and pico de gallo). They are all pretty good. I ordered the cheese enchiladas and asada taco combo and it was ok. I really liked the enchilada sauce, it's definitely not your canned version in most restaurants around here. The tacos weren't the best. The beef seemed kind of dry. Although the tortillas were homemade.
Warning: This place only gives you one free drink refill before they charge you for another drink and it's like 2.25 or something....weird. They also only give you one chip refill before they charge you 1.99 and they don't give a lot of chips.
