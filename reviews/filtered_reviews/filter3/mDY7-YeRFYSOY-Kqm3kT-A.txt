Let's just start by saying I'm not a fan of Mexican food, but we went here specifically for the Chicken Fundidos which we had sampled in the fall at the Taste of Cave Creek. They are so delicious!  Even more delicious at the restaurant with its Mexican ambiance, and its stellar outdoor patio!  A reminder to self, though . . . don't overdo it on the chips! 

This place isn't keen on reservations unless you call a couple hours ahead.  I called earlier in the day and they told me I'd have to call back. When I called back two hours beforehand, they said the couldn't accommodate a party of 2 until 8 pm. That was too late for us, so we thought we would just try to get in without a reservation, and if not, find another local restaurant. We arrived at 6 pm and there were tables galore -- inside and out!!!  I guess they all cancelled?

The service was prompt, but we felt rushed through our meal . . . maybe it was because they were expecting another crowd that might not show up!

So with that experience, it knocked a star off what could have been a really 4 star review!
