I'm so torn.  This place could be really good, and parts of it were.  I did enjoy their samples, and it definitely told me what was good and what was not.  Their system of ordering and the options you can choose are awesome.  

The jerk chicken rice and the black beans were the best part of the meal.  I didn't care for the red jade chicken.  It was just greasy sweet and sour chicken.  Takeout status.  I did enjoy the carnitas burrito, but why would I order that here if I can just go some real Mexican place anywhere else?  

Oh, your meal also comes with a cookie.  Snickerdoodle, to be precise.
