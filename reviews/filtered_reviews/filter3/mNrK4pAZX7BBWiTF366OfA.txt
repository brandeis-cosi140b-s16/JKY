My husband and I took our four kids here for dinner. I had the Baja fish tacos I didn't care that much for them. My husband got the chicken burrito. He didn't care for it but I really liked it. Two of my kids got the macn' cheese. The loved it! I honestly wish I would've got the Mac n cheese. My two other kids got the chicken strips and they said they where good. We also ordered the chips and salsa and I thought the salsa was gross. Overall it was ok. I wouldn't say I hated it but I didn't love it either. They sat us quickly and the service was good. It was also quiet which I love in a restaurant.
