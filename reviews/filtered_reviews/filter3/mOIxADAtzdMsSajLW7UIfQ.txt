We really need a 3.5 star rating, but since there isn't, we are going to round down since it's on the weak 3.5 side.  All that aside, the food is decent for Mexican standards.

They have a legit chili con queso (especially the one with chorizo too).  Think creamy velvetta cheese with chilis chopped up in there.  It is pure cheese heaven.

The food doesn't blow you away, but you can find some servicable choices that you will be satisfied with.  There is a shrimp in garlic sauce that is served with a guacamole salad that is really good.  You can enjoy some good guacamole with chips and finish off the rest with the salad.
