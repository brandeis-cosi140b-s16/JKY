So this another popular Mexican chain restaurant in AZ.  Fun atmosphere with Mexican decor throughout make this a great place and can accommodate larger groups and families.  The food is what you expect for classical Mexican food and better than average which is why this review has 3 stars.  If they made the ingredients better here this would be my go to for good priced Mexican food more often.  The margaritas are priced good, as are all other drinks, which makes this place a great spot for drinking a lot then having some Mexican food.  

The reason this is a 3 star and not 2 is because I am a huge Mexican foodie.  I deducted 2 stars because the food could have some better ingredients and it is a chain restaurant.  Both are negatives in my book.
