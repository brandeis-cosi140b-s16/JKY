I live right by ATS. RIGHT THERE. I had been there before and wasn't too impressed, but I had to give it another chance based on proximity alone. So I went after being reminded of the joint on abc15. The piece they were featured in made my mouth water so I decided to walk on over. 

I have to admit I am rather picky when it comes to Mexican food. I think most Mexicans are because nothing is going to compare to what Nana used to make us when we were young. Although I am choosy I do have favorite places that can suffice when I need some spice. (Sorry I had to be corny) 

They have signs that say best carne asada in town and I am sorry, but the Charlie's catering cart has better carne asada and they do not charge $3 per Mexican coke. 3 BUCKS! I am no cheap ass but damn. 

If you want to visit and  support small local business (which I totally do) check out ATS. 

If you want something less pricey and arguably more flavorful AZ has TONS of options.
