Mmmm, asian inspired tacos! Pretty happening beer list! My ear drums bleeding on live band night, suck! Well they weren't bleeding but let me tell you what it was insanely fucking loud in there. Like so loud you couldn't order your food at the counter you literally had to point at them menu to what you wanted. It took forever to get our food though it may have been ready but I couldn't hear if my name was being called. 

Highlights.. Shanghai Taco, Pescado Taco and the Bombay Taco. Lowlights.. Having tried most of the sides, chips and salsa is the best one with sweet potato fries being the worst  which were greasy, burnt and limp. 

Now with all that said I like Yayo, it's alright! Seriously though, come early before the live music starts. Unless of course hearing loss is your thing.
