One thing I always seek out the minute I leave Calgary, is Mexican food. Any of it. All of it. I step off the plane, hug my friends and mumble something about tortilla happiness and they know exactly what to do. Tacos from the trunk of a Cadillac? You say you made the tortillas yourself? I'll take three.

Well, the tacos at Roberto's don't come out of the back end of an El Dorado (that's a tale for another time), but the soft tortillas are fresh, the salsa bar is complimentary and it wasn't difficult to veganize my order. It's not the greatest ever, but it's very delicious and a place I will probably ask to come back to whenever I'm in town.
