The service here seemed to be a bit disorganized as they had the two cute bartendresses on duty doing bar back work at the height of happy hour.  The need of the bartendresses to both retrieve and restock glassware while simultaneously serving customers definitely resulted in slow service.  I found the margaritas to be rather small but they did seem to have a decent kick to them.  I had three of the carne asada tacos and they were very tasty but extremely small so it probably would have taken three or four orders to get anywhere close to a meal for me.  I think I would stick to happy hour at this place.
