Great service but the food is very bland. Shared the taco plate (shrimp, lengua, and carnitas) and chicken flautas. Many components of the dishes we had needed more depth. The rice and beans were completely uneventful. The carnitas tasted like absolutely nothing. The taco plate came with some salsa that was fresh tasting but could have had more of a kick to it. The flautas were decent as the chicken was seasoned and it came with a smoky/chipotle sauce to dip it in. They were so busy, I felt bad asking them for hot sauce since they don't have it out for easy access. The location is great but I recommend a hole in the wall taco shop for "real Mexican food made by real Mexicans" which they boast on the outside of their establishment.
