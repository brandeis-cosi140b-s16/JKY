For me, this place is very satisfactory. It's not super great, but it gets the job done. Also, I liked the chips and salsa that they served starting off. It was a nice mix of torilla chips and sweet potato chips. The service overall was really friendly and prompt and I didn't have a whole lot of complaints on that end.

My one complaint? The portions served. I got a chimichanga that looks like a fried burrito from chipotle with a side salad. It was a pretty good chimichanga, but i didn't feel that great after eating the body weight of a newborn with a side salad to boot. As you can tell, I'm not big on leaving anything on my plate. 

Lastly, the cherry on the frosting for me was the white chocolate pecan dessert thing they give you at the end. It's their version of the chocolate mints that they give you with the bill. Come here to eat, don't come here for fine dining.
