I'm very generous in this 3 star review.  This has been my absolute go to restaurant for 4 years. I was obsessed with their wine, service, bread, green chile potatoes, red meat (when I still ate it) and their fish specials. Every time we've had special guests in town, we've taken them here. Due to having a child , getting healthier and busier, it's been months since our visit. It was hot, sweaty, and we totally ignored.  After ordering entrees and  several bottles, we saw our food eons later.  There was no bread as well. And the more I thought about it, our old waiter was much better, yet he NEVER remembered us. Even though we came in regularly (weekly) and were very generous. So mabeye I shouldn't be surprised. I guess I wanted to like this place more than it deserved :(
