It was our first time to visiting ,it was cute decor . Love the patio , the soloist musician was great. The service was good. Our server advise us that our food was going to be 45 minutes wait. We were OK with that because we had time. So you are in a hurry don't go . We get our food we were not impress at all. I had the chili rellano dinner , they cover it with some red sauce it taste like ketchup. The guacamole had no favor at all. After spending $100 for 3 meals, 6 beers, and one appetizer we just where not impress at all. On our way out we hear a great band, now they do have a great band . We actually stay  a little bit more just to hear the band . so we decide if we want to listen to some great music we will go , but if we wanted to eat great mexican food we will go elsewhere.
