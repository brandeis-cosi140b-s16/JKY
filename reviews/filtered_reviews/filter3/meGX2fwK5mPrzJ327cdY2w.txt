Dropped into Sir Veza's Taco Garage on Thanksgiving morning with my family on the way out to California. Did not eat anything; this was about some liquid holiday cheer! 

Everything is served in Red Solo cups to keep track on who has a beverage, if ya catch my drift. 

Aside from the Tang, our bartender made a pretty good mimosa. Negra Modelo on tap. 

Also, the guy thought I had a Minnesota accent. Too funny. At the very least, thanks for giving this Northern California lady a good laugh! 

Prices seemed typical for airport drinks; however, when your awesome Pops is footing the bill . . . Who cares?!
