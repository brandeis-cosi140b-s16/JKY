LOVE the food here, but I'm not too pleased about their slow service and small servings.
I recently went in here for lunch for a change instead of Chipotle and at the time they didn't have any steak available. The server then had me wait on my exact spot in line until it was finished cooking (expected to have been between 5-7 minutes) while he served other people that weren't getting steak. I ended up leaving to go to Chipotle because of the long wait and the awkwardness I felt as people walked right past me as I waited in my spot in line. 
What keeps me coming back is really the food. The house dressing is amazing, meat is perfectly cooked and seasoned every time. I do wish they'd be a little more generous when it comes to their servings--I barely had any rice in my last tostada. 
Overall, I'd consider occasionally coming back to this location since it's closest to home but only when I'm not at a time crunch.
