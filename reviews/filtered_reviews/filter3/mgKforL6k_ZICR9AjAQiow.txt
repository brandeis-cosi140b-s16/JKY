First of all, this place DOES NOT serve traditional Mexican food.  The food quality is the type of food you would get at a Chilies or Applebee's.  So you are looking for Mexican food, this isn't the restaurant you are looking for. Anytime you go to a Mexican restaurant they serve chips and salsa... No chips and salsa??? After reading the menu you could get chips and salsa as an appetizer.  Service was horrible!!! Our waiter just walked around looking lost and never came to our table to refill our drinks. This place only serves White-ican food not Mexican food.
