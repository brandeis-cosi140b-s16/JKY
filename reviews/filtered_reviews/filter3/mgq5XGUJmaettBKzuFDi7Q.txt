Food is always excellent! However, today the service wasn't great. Ordered the guac, chips & tacos. The tacos arrived, but no guac & chips. When we asked the server what happened, he said oh it's coming now.  Obviously, he forgot to order it & he was pretty rude about it.
Normally, I would have said something to management regarding the service but, I was entertaining guests.
