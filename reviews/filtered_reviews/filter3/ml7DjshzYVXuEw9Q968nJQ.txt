Tried a few margaritas, and a ton of tacos.

Chicken tacos - a bit of gristle, and bland
Al pastor - pretty damn delicious
Pork belly - good, but would be better without the salad on top.
Mac & cheese - tasted like creamed corn with macaroni noodles

Regular margarita - decent
Spicy margarita (no clue what the actual name is) really delicious!

Overall, it was ok. Nothing amazing, but not horrible. I don't live near the Red Rock, so I wouldn't make the trip out there, but if I was in the area with friends that wanted Mexican food I would probably go.
