Never even knew about this place until I started hearing rumblings about this must eat place off Woodlawn.  I love Mexican food, probably my favorite, so I decided to give it a shot.

Meh...what's all the fuss about?  Very typical Mexican food.  Blindfold me, put a plate from Azteca or a place like Monterrey and I promise you I couldn't tell the difference.  

That being said....it's good.  I've been here several times and never been disappointed but at the same time, never overly impressed.  In the restaurant business no bad news is probably great news so take that as a compliment Azteca!

Service is quick and polite always.
