Hey it's hard to get Tex-Mex anywhere but Texas. The atmosphere was cool. The food was OK at best. I ordered the fajitas. They couldn't satisfy my taste buds for any spicy salsa. I was away from home and sure was wanting some nice spicy salsa and chips.

It has a more bar atmoshere of course. It would be fun with a group. I was actually there on business myself. I give it a three for the food, a five for the drinks and atmosphere. I would go again. It sits in front of the Monte Carlo so it's a good location to sit sip and eat on the strip.
