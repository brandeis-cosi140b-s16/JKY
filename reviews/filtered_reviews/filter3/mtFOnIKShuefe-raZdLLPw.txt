This is a generous three stars.

I don't get it.  This restaurant has mediocre Mexican food but the prices are reasonable. Every time I've been here the service has been terrible and this includes going for lunch when they weren't very busy. On one occasion my chips and salsa showed up after my entree was served and I'm still waiting on that drink refill.

They do have a patio. But, it's right on Tatum Blvd. If your idea of a beach style patio includes thousands of vehicles whizzing by then you have found your place.

I guess the draw here is the bar.  I wandered in with some friends one evening and the place was hopping. It was loud, crowded and packed with 20-somethings. For me, it was too loud, too crowded, and I've outgrown that "go out and get wasted" phase.
But, if you're into that sort of thing - go for it.
