Went to grab an order to go. I have been going to rehab burger but wanted to give this place a shot. Inside was pretty cool. Had an old time diner feel to it. I ordered the Texas burger but asked the sauce to be on the side. By the time I brought it home I found I did not get the sauce on the side. Seems like a pretty simple request and it's not like they were busy (I was the only one there). Having said that the burger and fries were pretty good. Just a straight up tasty diner style burger the way it should be. I guess the in enthusiastic service and the screwing up of my request of having the sauce on the side is why it's 3 stars instead of five.
