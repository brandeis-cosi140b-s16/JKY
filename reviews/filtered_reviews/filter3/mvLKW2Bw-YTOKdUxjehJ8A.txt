Last night Eric R. and I visited friends who live in the Lake Las Vegas area.  We walked through the empty bridge that used to belong to the defunct Ritz.  Our friends asked if we liked Mexican, to which I replied, "It's Eric's favorite!"

We sat at a large booth, and the staff was very friendly, bringing 2 baskets of chips and 2 salsas for the four of us.  We all had a cold beer, and I definitely appreciate a place that has Dos Equis on tap (lager AND amber)!

I opted for the ceviche tostada appetizer as my meal, and was not disappointed - piled high with citrus spiked shrimp and fish, slices of avocado, quite a bit of heat from diced jalepeno, tomatoes, and a small side salad of mango and carrot.  It was the healthiest possible option at a Mex restaraunt.

Eric R. ordered beef fajitas for himself and enjoyed the big plates of food.  Our friends shared off the menu beef nachos and had enough for 2 more people to eat them probably.  Overall, good service and food, wouldn't rush back to Lake Las Vegas to eat here, but it is a solid choice if you find yourself out there.
