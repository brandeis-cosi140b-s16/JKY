Three stars is about right.  This location was not too far from our gate in Terminal 4.  We had a bite to eat here yesterday before our flight home.  Alan had the tacos de camarones w/ water to drink.  I had iced tea and a fruit plate because I wasn't that hungry.  The iced tea was fresh brewed and good.  The fruit plate was OK.  The strawberries were fairly good, the pineapple was very good and the honeydew was hard and tasteless.  The apple slices were too sweet for me, but fine for Alan and the cantaloupe went to him too.  He reported the tacos were fine.  Prices were high, as you would expect in an airport.  Service was very nice.
