This is a good mexican food restaurant, not the greatest I've had and certainly didn't live up to all the hype I hear from others (at least not for me). Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but the items I've tried are average with other similar restaurants. The place is always packed, so I might be in the minority with my opinion. I usually get take-out and my biggest gripe with Rio Mirage is that they give you only a *teeny* bag of chips and an extremely small amount of salsa (seriously, about two tbsp) with the take-out order (order of 3-4 entrees). Pretty annoying when you get plenty of chips and salsa when you dine-in (and also compared to the chips and salsa you get with Macayo's take-out). If you ask for more chips and salsa they will charge you for it. So take-out orders, if you like a lot of chips/salsa be aware.
