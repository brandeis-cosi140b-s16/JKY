If you found this place on zagat, turn around now. Theres no way its so high rated. We had the calamari as an appetizer but it wasn't anything special. The 14 oz pork entree was decent but nothing close to fantastic. The brocoli was fresh. We got the roast duck and it was pretty bad. Lacked any flavor
