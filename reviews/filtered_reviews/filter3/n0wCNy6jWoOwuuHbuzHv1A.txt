Massive portions for the price. I paid $7.99 for an XL burrito that was the length of a dinner plate.

The staff was quick, friendly, and the lemonade is fresh squeezed.

The highlight of this place is the outdoor patio. It is quiet and relaxed; just what I needed after a long day golfing.

In Texas we take Tex-Mex seriously, so this food was only average for me.
