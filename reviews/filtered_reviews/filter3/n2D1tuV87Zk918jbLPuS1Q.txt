Great decor, wide opened space which, I love and they even have a ride the bull. 

The downfall is that the bathroom is upstairs, however if given the choice, I would definitely hangout upstairs, you get a bit of a view and it has a bar with plenty of seating.

As for the food, I can definitely say that I love the chips, love the green salsa but not a huge fan of the red salsa.

I ended up getting the pork ($26, not worth the price), which was okay, it didn't come with any but pork, which I was a bit disappointed with. I think I fort sick form it, because after dinner I did not feel well. I didn't drink any alcoholic beverage when I was there either and I was the only one that ate it. 

My boyfriend got the lobster tacos, it consisted 80% veggies. The waiters messed up everyone's orders and have everyone flour tortillas and not corn (not a huge deal). 

I did like the music they were playing a lot of "old" school hip hop.
