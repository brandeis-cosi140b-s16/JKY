The place had a great vibe good service and music. I didn't feel like i was in a restaurant on the casino floor even though we were. 
I have had a lot of great Mexican food in my life so 4 stars didn't seem fair. Food was good but not great.
I would recommend if your in the immediate area but not worth the money if you have to make a trip.
We had the taco dinner a few margaritas and the fried ice cream portions were good and so was the food not bad.
The atmosphere trumped the cuisine
