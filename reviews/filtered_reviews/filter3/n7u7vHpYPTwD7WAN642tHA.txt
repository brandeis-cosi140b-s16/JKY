It's funny how the service can make or break an evening. 

I'm a pretty easy going guy with a pretty high tolerance level, however if you piss off the wife you instantly are on my shit list! Starting obviously with the service, overall in the restaurant it seemed fine but our waiter Gabe was pretty bad. I wasn't sure if he really wanted us to be there. Do you care? Do you not want a tip? Is this your civil service? 

On to the food...By far the best dish was the Quesadilla with Langostine Borracho. The langostine was cooked to perfection, it did have a bit of shell but that is something I can deal with. The goat cheese is the flavor that really put it over the top. Nice dish! 

The chicken mole was also a winner, however it was lacking in quantity  department with the mole sauce. If you get this dish you typically are ordering it primarily for the sauce. Don't skimp! 

The prices are also a bit hefty. The two ladies next to us got their bill and gasped, "$95 for the two us!" I don't think you should be surprised by the bill, after-all the prices are on the menu, however be forewarned! 

They should get a 4 star for their food but unfortunately the service is still part of the deal. I would go back if I lived in the area minus Gabe to give it another shot.
