The margaritas here are about the best I've ever had.  Ice is blended so smooth it was like a fine slush.  Mix and flavor were perfect too.  On the other hand, the food was extremely disappointing.  Had the chicken fajitas and they were not very good. Chicken was good, but everything else lacked flavor.  I've had much better Mexican food at chain restaurants.  I would go back for the margaritas, but I would,eat elsewhere.
