I only gave it 3 stars. We live right by Mexteca so a lot of times it's our go-to place for Mexican food. Lately we've been disappointed. I always order street tacos and they don't seem as fresh as they used to be. My husband gets the Mexican pizza and he can say the same.  The breakfast burritos seem like they've been pre made and warmed up...they used to be much fresher. This place isn't as busy as other competitors near by like Carambas, yet the wait to get your food is really long. The workers also don't seem as friendly anymore. I don't know if something has changed with management or if my husband and I are just tried of eating here. Prices are decent and decor inside is nice! Just not the best food anymore.
