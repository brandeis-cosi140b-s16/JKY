I'm split on this one.

The food? Four stars.  I've had both the veggie burrito and the black bean burrito (the two main veggie options), and both were delicious. My partner has had the chicken burrito twice, and loved it.  Rice? Good. Beans? Good. Worth 5 stars? No, and the prices may be a little high, but it is still good food.

The service? Outstanding.  People have always been friendly, the manager always stops by, waitstaff offer salsa and drink refills, they have a togo window, it's great.

So why 3 stars?  

Two reasons;

1) At first, they seem all green/enviro friendly; their placemats are printed with soy-ink, their bathroom offers half-flush to save water. So why the hell are they using STYROFOAM cups for drinks, and the beans/rice?  Hello!  Even if they didn't want to go get bio-degradeable cups, styrofoam is HORRIBLE for the earth. It almost makes it worse that they're clearly trying to be green in other areas, because it's so easy and affordable to find an alternative to styrofoam.

2) The other issue is the bathrooms. The women's room has three half naked men hanging out (the men's room apparently has half naked women).  A beach scene, I get, but it's really fucking creepy have life size photos of anyone watching you pee...and as a queer woman, the fact that they're men makes it even creepier. Add to that the wall between the men's and women's is slightly see through, so that when someone is in the other side, you can see the light, and the shadows of their movement.  Super creepy.

So breaking it down --
Cost: 3 stars
Food: 4 stars
Service: 5 stars
Weird policies on being "green" and creepy as hell bathrooms: 1 star.

All in all, 3 stars.
