I've gone to both locations in Scottsdale and they both have their own pleasant chill atmosphere. I like the North Scottsdale location a little more because it's more open and less stuffy. Lunch specials are a good deal. 

I've tried a few items, but I generally get the beef tacos. The taco comes out really hot because it's fried, the taco is a little drippy with grease, but it's quite good. They get a an extra kudos from me for carrying RC Cola on tap. This place is middle of the road Mexican and you'll feel a little bloated after you eat there, but still pretty good overall.
