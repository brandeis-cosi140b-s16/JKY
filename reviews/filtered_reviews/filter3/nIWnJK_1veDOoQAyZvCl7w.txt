Visited this place with friends for Cinco de Mayo.  Understandably very crowded, so we waited at the bar.  I had the Maverick margarita, which tasted like a margarita should.  The bartender appeared to be a bit juvenile....I don't know if he thought he was flirting, but my girl friend stated that his banter may work on twenty something's, but not on women of our age.  Besides the bartender, there were two donkeys outside, dressed in tiny sombreros!  The donkeys were sweet and didn't try to unsuccessfully flirt with us.  Anyway, we were seated in under an hour, and, while we waited, we had chips and salsa.  Very average, but having something to snack on was great!  The bar area had a band and was noisy in general, so we were delighted to sit in the back area.  I liked that the menu designated the vegetarian items.  I ordered a dish that sounded so decadent:  three cheese quesadillas with spinach and portabello mushrooms, sour cream and quacamole.  They also came with a garnish of cabbage and tomatoes.  The quesadillas did not taste as special as they sounded.  In fact, one could not have picked them out of a dive bar quesadilla lineup.  Also, I had to ask our waitress for a glass of water three times.  Good thing I wasn't in the desert.
About the decor......the walls featured pictures of rock musicians, such as Jimmy Page, Ozzy and Peter Frampton.  But, the music did not match the theme.  The genre was basically pop music of today, with a surprise song by Journey thrown in (oooooh, that was heavy!).  One detail that caught the eye of myself and my rocker chick friend was a stencil near the bathrooms that said, "you are never too old to rock."  Photo op for us aging head bangers!  So the outdoor donkeys and the stenciling saved the day!
