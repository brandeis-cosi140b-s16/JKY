I kept hearing the radio commercial on 96.7 and although kinda annoying I decided to give it a try if I ever find myself in that area. I was having some work done to my car a block away and decided to walk there for lunch.


The Good:
Friendly staff, very clean and fast service. I had a carne asada burrito and decided to try the al pastor tacos. It is the best al pastor I've had so far here in Vegas. I love Pepe's Tacos and Los Tacos Companita which have excellent al pastor. Taco Y Taco's al pastor blows them out of the water! The salsa bar is clean and a great variety of salsas. The tables were clean and the staff is constantly cleaning up after messy people that leave there trays on the table. Unlike Roberto's or Pepe's where its usually messy and the tables are filthy and the salsa bars are usually disgusting! I was very impressed how well they keep the dinning area. Taco Y Taco has fresh ingredigents and ordering at the windows is easy. Everything is made in front of you and the protions are good sized. 


The Bad:
I would give it 5 stars but for a total experience they lose 2 stars for the fact that they have a huge swap cooler in the dining area. Its loud and if you're not sitting where the air is blowing on you it's very hot inside. I hate sweating while I'm trying to eat. Next time I'll get it to go and eat in the car with the AC on.

Homeless and shady people hanging around the doors begging for money and cigarettes. I really hate this. The manager needs to run these shady folks away, call Metro or whatever get rid of them. My biggest peeve of any place I go is vagrants begging. 

Overall, great food, fast and friendly service. The food is 5 stars, the experience and no AC would put my total experience at 3.5- 4 stars.
