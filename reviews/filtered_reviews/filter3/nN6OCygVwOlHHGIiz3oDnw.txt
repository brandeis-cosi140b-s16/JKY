Went here a few weeks ago. Food was pretty good. Service was ok except the waiter offered me to do a 1/2 red and 1/2 green sauce on my chimi. I thought wow, what a great option. Unfortunately, what he didn't inform me of was that there would be a $2.50 charge for this. WTH? Why? Same amount of sauce, just a different type. Hmmm, that left a pretty foul taste in my mouth. Not sure if we'll go back. I realize $2.50 is not a huge amount, we spent more than that on their watered down margarita's, It was just the principle.
