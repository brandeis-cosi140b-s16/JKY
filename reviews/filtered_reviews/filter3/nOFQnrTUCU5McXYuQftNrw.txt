You know when you really excited to go on that new ride at the amusement park beacuse it is all flash and new tech stuff, but when you get there, practically wetting your pants because you're next to go on the ride,  and then the attendant tells you that they have to close the ride for the day because one of the bolts got loose and the cart went careening off the track at 60 miles an hour and there are "technical difficulties" with the ride equipment, aka somebody's got killed until dead?

This place can be succinctly summed up by that quick anecdote.

Now for the review and something completely different:

Nice casual, relaxing setting. However, the food is not that great. Ordered the Machaca tacos.  They were alright but they were definitely nothing special.  The guacamole was way overpriced for the quality, $9 for something that should be worth $5 at the most. Overall it is a fun setting, but it is not a place if you are serious about eating.

Cheers,
Until then, get the beers in...
