The food here is pretty bland for the most part - but they are always wonderful at accommodating our large family group (and special order requests to fit our dietary restrictions). We've been coming for years and the quality is consistent.

I've found the service to be pleasant and warm - ditto the food. It's a place the whole family enjoys going to - so I'm guessing we'll continue to keep coming back.
