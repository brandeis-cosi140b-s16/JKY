Excellent view of the strip from upstairs.  Its all open air except fabric shade ceiling over the dance floor. Table dancers downstairs and a nice open environment that is upbeat.

Great mix of music and very good service upstairs as well as downstairs.  The biggest drawback is that the prices are way too high for food and drinks for this kind of a place but it's a fun place to visit in a pleasant upbeat atmosphere.  Good mix of people there.
