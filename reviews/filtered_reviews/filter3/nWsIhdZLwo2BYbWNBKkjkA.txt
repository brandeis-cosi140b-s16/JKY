I want to love The Mission. I really do. The decor is awesome and the margaritas ROCK! But, the food is not doing it for me and I'm so disappointed! 

I have had the guacamole and I thought it was fine but nothing so special it should be three times the price of guacamole anywhere else.

The cheese plate, on the other hand, I'd say that's where it's at  - the cheese portions were fair and the grilled pan de yuca was warm, soft and delicious!

The pozole was good but while I thought it was cute that the "heat" came on the side (you add your own serrano and garnish) I would have liked more of the flavor to come from the kitchen. 

I actually have to say I did NOT like the mahi mahi tacos and it had nothing to do with the size (they ARE small - the tortillas can't be more than 4 inches in diameter but the filling portions are generous). It was the fat little fish sticks that served as the filling --  all I could taste was the batter! By my second taco, I was trying to pick the batter off and come the third - I just gave up and left it in hopes of enjoying dessert.

Dessert was good - I had the churros on the recommendation of the many Yelp reviews I had read and they were OK. I actually preferred the fried bananas - more specifically, the peanut butter mousse that they were plated with! 

OK, I was going to give this place 2 stars but I'm going to round up to 3 with a caveat: For dinner, "Meh. I've experienced better." but for sharing a cheese plate, maybe some pozole, a couple margaritas or a romantic setting for dessert with a bottle of wine, it's "A-OK."
