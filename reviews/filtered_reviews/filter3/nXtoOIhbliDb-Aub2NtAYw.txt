Tonight was our 3rd visit to Mariscos Playa while the food was very very good we were a little put off by the Blue Moon special that they offered.  She offered the special buy one get one Blue Moon and as we were going to have a beer anyway we took the offer.  All was good until the bill came and she charged us $12 for the 2 BOGO beers. (4 beers total).  This is a total rip off when you can have any domestic or imported beer on there menu every day for $3.99.
So as far as we were concerned they just raised the price on the beer to $6 to cover for the BOGO.  We could have had 4 imports for $16. So we really only got 1 free.
Maybe it was our fault for assuming but we also felt a little screwed over.
