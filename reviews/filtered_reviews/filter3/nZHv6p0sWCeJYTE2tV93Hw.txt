I'm confused...I came here based on Yelp reviews, but I am not impressed at all. My mom, sister and I arrived on a Wednesday afternoon around 4:30, and there were barely any other people in the place (not unusual for this time and day). We each ordered a margarita ($11) and they were huge, but they didn't do a lot for us. Not much different than other places.

The food is where it got bad. The chips come with three salsas, and it's $3.50 for a refill. The salsas are okay, lacking in flavor. I ordered the tacos al pastor(which admittedly is never very good in anywhere but a taco stand off the beaten path), and the meat was extremely dry and hard. The rice and beans had no flavor. My sister ordered the seafood enchiladas, which were supposed to have pacific shrimp, mahi, and scallops. What they came with was tiny bay shrimp, literally zero scallops, and the mahi was more like canned tuna. The sauce on her enchiladas was quite tasty though! My mom ordered the mole platter, which was the best of the three dishes. It came with three different kinds, which I haven't seen done before. All three were very flavorful and different from one another, and the portion was HUGE! Two or three people could have split that one dish. There only issue was the meat was a bit dry. 

The plus side is the service was actually excellent! Our waitress even offered my mom ice for her injured knee :)

I'm glad I tried this place, but I definitely would not go back.
