I was served some salsa (3 types) and tortillas when I ordered my dinner. The three salsas served with the tortillas were very good. The prices for the entrees are on the pricy side for a classical Mexican menu. I had the chile relleno. It was good,  but not the best I have had. The staff was great, and service was fast.
