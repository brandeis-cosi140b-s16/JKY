Stopped at Julia on a Saturday afternoon with the kids. It was ok. My daughter and I like to think of ourselves as Carne Asada experts, so we decided to give this place a shot. Like my 3-star rating, it was OK. I wasn't blown away by any means, it was good.  I had an all meat Carne Asada burrito with guacamole and lettuce only and it was decent.
