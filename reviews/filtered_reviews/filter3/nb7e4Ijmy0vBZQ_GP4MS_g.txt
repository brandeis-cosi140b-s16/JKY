Now if you like cheese this is the place for you. I almost always order something different and so far my favourite is the Seafood Relleno. A bit odd with the seafood, but it works. Swimming in cheese, luckily its easy enough to push the unwanted cheese to the side. After doing so, I finally get to the pepper itself and all the goodness that it is stuffed with.

The salsa is always good and comes with some hotter salsa that you can either mix with the regular or eat with the warm tortilla chips.
