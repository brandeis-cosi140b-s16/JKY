I got the steak and chicken fajitas, the proteins them selves where pretty good, well cooked and seasoned pretty good. Classic fajitas veggies, red and green peppers, onions. But the thing that was odd was all the other toppings were in these strange shaped side plates, it was kind of messy. Other then that, the beans sucked. Luke warm, mushy and frankly unappealing. The rice tasted like it came out of a box. Honestly this place was a bit of a let down, I was expecting something delicious when o walk down the strip of Las Vegas. The building inside looks cool, lots of art and live music too! I highly recommend taking a picture with the framed picture of nickleback.
