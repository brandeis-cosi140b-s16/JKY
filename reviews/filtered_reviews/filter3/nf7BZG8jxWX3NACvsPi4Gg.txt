Los Taquitos isn't really a place you go to eat eat side since there isn't really room to sit. The food is decently priced but the portions are pretty small compared to filibertos. The only reason I come back and pay more is because the quality is better. The tortillas are amazing as well as the beans. Filibs can't even compete in the area. The staff isn't really friendly but they also aren't rude. They are just in between. I will keep coming back for the flavor that you don't get at most other tiny fast food joints. Based on the many phone orders my friends and I have ordered over the years they usually mess it up in one way or another so be careful.
