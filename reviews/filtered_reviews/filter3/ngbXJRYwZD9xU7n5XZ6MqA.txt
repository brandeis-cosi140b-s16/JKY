Good food, but not fantastic. If you're looking for ambiance then this tour place. If you're more about the food then its only mediocre. A bit pricey for the food, but not exorbitant. This was my third time here, this time I had chicken enchiladas to go (my first to go order here). Nothing really memorable, just decent food. Really can't go wrong with any dish, I would have rated 4 stars for dine in but 3 because the service at the bar getting my order wasn't so great.
