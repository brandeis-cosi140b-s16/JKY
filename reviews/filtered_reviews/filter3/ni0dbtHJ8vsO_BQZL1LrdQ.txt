Like Aldo, I also felt it was weird to be eating in a place like this surrounded by people wearing hockey jerseys. But a good kind of weird...like "Yeah that's right! My Kings just kicked some Avalanche ass, and now I'm going to eat Mexican food to soak up all the alcohol in my stomach while still wearing my Kings jersey!" kinda weird. Okay. okay. I was one of those crazy Kings jersey wearing bandidios. On to the food...

Ordered the queso fundido, chicken tacos & 2 mojitos. The fundido was not cheese sauce, but actually melted cheese with meat and peppers. It was served with fresh. warm corn tortillas. Greasy and delicious! The chicken tacos were okay, and the chips and salsa were pretty good. The mojitos were on the weak side...not cool. Service was okay and the decor was RED! If this place didn't water down their beverages, I would have gave it a 4 star rating. 

So kids, in conclusion, if you're in the Grandido, skip the mojitos and try the fundido! Just pray it doesn't give you the rundidos...peace out amigos!
