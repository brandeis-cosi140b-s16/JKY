The food I HAVE tried has been just so-so. 
Nachos at lunch, a Cuban sandwich. 
The margaritas however? Get stars for that alone!!
They have so many to choose from... Blackberry seems to be the most popular. It has real berries and all their margaritas taste like they have fresh fruit or ingredients. 
Guava, white peach and the spicy one they have are also delish! I will continue to come here for the margaritas and give more on their dining menu a try!
