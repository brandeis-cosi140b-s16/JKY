This place is just ok...I ordered the shrimp enchilladas which were kinda bland. I am giving it 3 stars because we were seated quickly despite their being like 10 people waiting and the service was good. But i live in tempe and the food is just not worth the drive I can get this same food at garcia's or arriba's with a little more seasoning.
