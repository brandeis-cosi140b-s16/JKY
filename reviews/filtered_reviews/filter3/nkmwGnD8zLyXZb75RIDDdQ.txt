Mexican plus Irish?  Heh? Eh, sure, why not.
Carlos O'Brien reminds me of what you get when you cross Bennigan's with Chili's, toss out the Irish Food and Mexicanize the meals. Is it cause they have Guiness with nachos? Or quesedillas with potatoes? Either way, it's American-Mexican and not bad.

I was taken here by an Arizona local, who said it was her favorite place to go with her husband years ago. Our server was friendly and attentive, and the chips were light and crispy, served with a decent salsa.  My spinach-bean burrito wasn't bad and my elder companion enjoyed her veggie quesedillas which were chewy and cheesy but otherwise typical. Not really "authentic" but probably a good place to go when you wanna watch and ASU game and crave nachos.
