We ended up here for Thanksgiving dinner while waiting for Blue man Group at the Monte Carlo. We were looking for a quick bite to eat and something yummy.
 
The buffalo wings were awesome. I like really hot stuff but we ordered the medium heat and it was defiantly good.  Lots of good heat and spice, but could still taste the chicken and the flavoring of the wing sauce. We got the full order of wings (13) and split them. 

My rating drops a little here. When i looked at the reviews on my phone it was rated at $$. But, $14 for a cheese quesadilla is just crazy talk for a tortilla and some cheese. I know you gotta pay the rent for your prime location, but charge $7 for the cheese tortilla and you'll sell double what you do now.

The nachos looked amazing and I had wished I had ordered them, but we were trying to eat a light meal before the show. The fajitas smelt awesome too.

All in all I liked the place. I will revisit it on a future trip to Vegas for the nachos or fajitas 

Oh and you should be able to find 2 for 1 drink coupons nearby or at the hostess stand.

I still bought a $20 t-shirt because I enjoyed the atmosphere, friendly staff and tasty food.
