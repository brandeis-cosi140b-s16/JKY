Surprised to see a couple of negative reviews on this place.  Ok, so its not mindblowingly spectacular.  But, if you expected culinary brilliance from a place that is located in a glorified strip mall and serves salsa in a ketchup bottle, you should probably reevaluate your expectations.  I always enjoy a good ol' fashion Bean and Cheese Burrito or the Chicken Avocado Salad.  I love their spicy salsa and usually use the salsa instead of dressing on the salad.  We have used their catering service for a couple big family parties and everyone always enjoys it.
