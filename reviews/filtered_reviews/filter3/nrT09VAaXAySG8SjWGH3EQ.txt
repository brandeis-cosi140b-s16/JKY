Sorry, don't know what all the hype was about. I love nachos but there better be a pony in it for me to call you daddy. 

I expected knock me out and tuck me into bed awesome sauce nachos (thanks a lot Yelpers), but we got something that was fine just the way your college roommate used to make it. Where you're not sure if it's that good or if you're that drunk. Either way it does the trick for sure and I'll give it to them that they're BIG. 

But hey! There's vegetarian and vegan nachos and that's about as hipster as the place gets (surprisingly for the area) and that's cool. There's also margaritas and scorpion shots and more alcohol so you can't complain too much. Go drunk with a group! 

I'd definitely take a brood of children here, they'd demolish the plates. Me not so much. I stop in the middle, at the cold part. But I'm a forgiving person and I love downtown so I wouldn't be surprised if I stumbled in here often and partied with the inconsistencies. 

Sad to see so many bad service reviews since our guy was great. He kept the jalapeños coming. Seriously, boss daddy, don't be stingy and add more jalapeños. 

Ask for extra whatever you want. Might as well. Cheers! Just gulp it down.
