I have reviewed Rokerij before, but thought it was time for an update. Sadly, I think my   admiration for the place is starting to fade. First, the size of the Prickly Pear margaritas has been cut in half. Unfortunately, the price is the still the same. Also, Happy Hour at Rokerij is just plain awful. It used to be fantastic - cheap appetizers and great beer and wine prices. Now the appetizers are basically 10% off. Yea - feel like I brought a coupon. 

The menu has shrunk down a bit, but the choices are still very good. I am a big fan of the Pasta Heidi. It still delivers - tasty chicken and spicy sauce. 

I am certain that I will still frequent Rokerij, but probably not as often. 

N*joy...
