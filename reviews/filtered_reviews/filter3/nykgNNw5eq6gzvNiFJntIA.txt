Being "creatively employed" Dick's is absolutely my most favorite place to go for brunch at 2pm on a weekday...Excellent bloody marys, though I miss the spicy pickled asparagus spears that once adorned the drink...and the tenderloin benedict is just amazing...but anyway, here's the deal: Had a psychic moment with the girlfriend and we wanted Dick's (hahaha) brunch, BAD, yesterday. So we roll up at 10am, and yes, expected it to be hopping as it was Memorial Day, which it was...However, here's the deal...Popped our head in the side dining room and there were a few tables open, clean and ready to go, so we waited to be acknowledged....Jim Jarmusch look-alike waiter/manager, I don't know, but he's always there, comes rolling up and tells us rather shortly that there's nothing available and we can go to Richardson's if we want, and we said very pleasantly, I might add, "oh, but there's a few tables over there,"  to which his face turned cold, and he says "YEAH, but  you won't be seen for more than 20 minutes," in a rather mean way...F that. SO, I say "Sorry you're so understaffed on Memorial Day, we'll spend our money elsewhere."  I'm surprised he didn't spit on us as we left.  Thing is, we would have waited, but this guy was such a, *ahem* d*ck, about it, I didn't expect we'd have received any level of quality service if we did get seated in 20 minutes. What happened? I don't know, but I'm pretty bummed out about it.  We went to our favorite bar for a couple bloody mary's, and then had lunch at Ticoz, where everyone was smiling, and the service and food were solid.
