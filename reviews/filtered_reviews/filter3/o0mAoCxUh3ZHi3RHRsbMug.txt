I was excited to eat here with my friend who was in from LA for her birthday. Unfortunately the service was pretty slow, the food was not very fresh, and the bill was overpriced for what we got. 

The decor is cute and outdoorsy with a view of a busy intersection on Las Vegas Boulevard. Convenience and alcohol is what this place has going for it.
