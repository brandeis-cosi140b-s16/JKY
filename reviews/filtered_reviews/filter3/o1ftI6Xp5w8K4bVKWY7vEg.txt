We were looking for somewhere 'different' so we stopped into Nacho Daddy for lunch.  We each ordered the full order of the Supreme Tostada Nacho and a pitcher of frozen Margaritas.  Our mistake was ordering the entr√©e size...we should have ordered the small or just one full order as they are HUGE!  To our surprise, the pitcher came with two mason jars already filled with the frozen Margarita's so we had more than enough to drink...LOL!  The Nacho's and Margaritas were good and we would come back again.
