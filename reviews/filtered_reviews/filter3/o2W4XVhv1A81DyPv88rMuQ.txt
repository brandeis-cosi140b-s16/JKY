Stopped in here while walking through the Flamingo.  We took advantage of the 2 for $10 margaritas, but got them to go so we could walk through the garden.  We tried a passion fruit and a mango and have to say that they were delicious. Very real fruit flavors and not too sweet at all. They were not very strong, but were delicious as I observed the birds and koi in the garden.  

At 2pm on a Friday, the place was empty, maybe due to the fact that the outdoor area was closed for the winter, but I would recommend taking advantage of the drink special and then hitting the sites.
