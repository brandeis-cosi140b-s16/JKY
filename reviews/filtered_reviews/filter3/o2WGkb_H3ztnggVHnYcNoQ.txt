Great food, but I had a problem with the cleanliness of the dining area.  While the food was great the seating was rough and there was never a clean table available.  The floor had food remnants all over it and I wasn't excited to stay and eat there.  I sat in my car outside and ate there.  Like I said, I enjoyed the food but without the restaurant experience.  I'll be back for takeout soon.
