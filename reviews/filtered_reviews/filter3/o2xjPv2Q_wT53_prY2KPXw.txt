Her Royal Highness and I just stopped in as we had not been here in many, many moons and wanted to pass along the good and the bad.

First off, think small, casual Mexican beach taco joint ........  Hell, they ought to have sand on the floor and it would be perfect!.  Started with chips and salsa and was very pleased.  They make their own chips and they were crisp and tasty.  The salsa was good too but make sure you ask for the extra hot ...  Very good if you like it hot.

The menu is very complete and the most expensive item is around $16 so the prices are right.  They have both an inside bar as well as an outside bar and I noted 7 TV's so if your a sports fan, you are in good shape.

The only thing I didn't like was the somewhat slow service.  Too many employees hanging out with each other, looking at junk on their cell phones .... C'mon, I need another cocktail!!

Small friendly joint, pretty good grub, Mexico style laid back and a "no hurry" service  program.  It's OK but they could improve.

Thanks for reading!
