Maybe my expectations were set way too high for this place, due to its universal praise, but I can't help but feel like Tacos Atoyac could be better.  They have some solid tacos, to be sure.  The first thing I noticed, after walking in the door, is that they have a good menu.  Plenty of taco choices, including cabeza, tripa, lengua, and chorizo; quesadillas; an oaxacan hot dog (perro caliente, they call it); and more.  Furthermore, they have a solid selection of Mexican sodas.

So why just three stars?  I've had all of the above items, and none of them really blew me away.  The tacos were good, but I have had better street tacos elsewhere.  These tacos were just a little too high on the grease, and a little low on the flavor.  The tripa tastes a little more burnt than tripa I've had elsewhere; perhaps they fried it too long?  The quesadillas are pretty standard quesadillas (although the asada ones may be worth a shot next time).  The chorizo was... pink?

The hot dog was pretty good, with the black beans, and avocado, so they get points for having a unique item there.  I don't know where else you can get a dog like this.  Unfortunately, I do prefer a Sonoran dog; the Oaxacan dog is a little too light on the heat.

Don't let underwhelming tacos dissuade you from trying this place, though; it's a great place to get some tacos if you're in the area.  It will probably earn a spot in my lunch rotation as long as I'm working in the neighborhood, but you probably don't need to go across town for this.
