I really enjoyed the salsa bar from the Mexicana to the 7 chile's one.  I had the 3 street  taco meal with rice and beans.  Meats I chose were carne  asada, mayan pibil and the Aztec  tingi. The carne asada was dry and not flavorful and i didn't enjoy the taste of the tingi taco.  the last taco made it all worth it the Mayan pibil was delicious and I can't wait to have this again. They marinate the red onions in lemon, this simple touch makes the tacos so much better.  Javier had the red beef burrito this was very spicy but he enjoyed it.  We also had the house Margarita. They put lemons and orange slices in the drink.  This was an excellent margarita and for 8.00, I think this was a great deal. Our total bill for 2 meals, 2 beers and a Margarita was 37.00. The only down side to this place was the old plates. They were not the glossy ones and had chips and paint missing. I know it goes with the decor but i think this could be worked on.  We will be returning to try more food from this taco shop.
