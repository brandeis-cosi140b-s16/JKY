Didn't eat here. This place has a bar downstairs and a small dance floor upstair. It's free. First time we came here, there was just a DJ playing a good mix of music. Second time, they had a live band performing rock/alternative music upstairs. This place is ghetto, but with good music. They have 2 police upstairs so nothing to worry about. Not a bad place to go. They also have $3 drink specials.
