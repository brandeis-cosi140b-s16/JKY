Had dinner here last night. The service was decent, our waiter was very helpful and refilled our drinks as was necessary. They were very accommodating with our children, we needed two high chairs, we were a party of six. Not a problem there.

The food is mediocre, nothing spectacular. I had the enchiladas suizas, which were tasty but nothing spectacular. My daughter ordered the beef tamales which were mostly masa and not enough beef. My husband had the carne asada burrito but wasn't excited about it. The one thing I did enjoy was the Taquitos appetizer, the shredded beef was delicious and the taquitos were not overcooked. Crunchy not soft. Another thing I enjoyed was that they give you chips with not only salsa but also beans and guacamole for starters so bam right there you already have nachos!!

One disappointment was their drinks selection, we asked if they had any horchata, tamarindo, etc and they don't. Our nice waiter even explained we weren't the first to ask about those drinks, maybe it's something they can look into, I mean come on, even Am Pm offers them. 

Prices are basic but you do get big servings. If you're craving basic Mexican then this is a good place for you. If you want authentic don't waste your time. Oh and no kids menu :(
