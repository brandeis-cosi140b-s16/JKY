I asked for shredded beef tacos and got rolls tacos. The waiter said I should have asked for the gringo tacos since its the same thing as shredded beef tacos.. humm. I also got the corn on crack from the waiters suggestion as well as the watermelon beverage. The corn on crack was drowning in fake butter,  cheese and chile powder. ... No one at my table would touch it because it smelt and looked gross. 
The burritos looked good and folks at my table were satisfied which is why I gave 3 stars. I loved the watermelon beverage! This place has a great name, located in a great park, decent service and ok food.
