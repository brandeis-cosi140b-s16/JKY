We are in Las Vegas for a convention and wanted out of the hotel for dinner, the bell desk recommended this restruant. Six of us went,  we all ordered different items and drinks.  All were pleased with their meals.  The chips, salsa, bean dip along the the guacamole, made at table side were great.  

Pricing was reasonable.  I would return if in town again.
