I left this place feeling so full that I almost fell asleep on the light rail, then back at work I had to nap just to regain consciousness.

The atmosphere of Tolteca is great, very colorful and energizing.  The food is cooked in massive scale which matches the size of the menu.  I had the combo plate which included Carne Asada, beans and rice and tortillas.  It was enough for two, but wasn't the greatest "Mexican" I've had.  My friend had the fajitas and I am excited to go back and get them for myself.

Aren't there a bunch of cuisines in Mexico?  Why does the cheapest stuff get labeled authentic?

The bakery is immense and matches the exuberance of the rest of the decor.  I had a classic pink morning bun and a couple of the macaroons to top off the already heavy meal.

Why do I do this to myself?  If I see it, I eat it, painfully.  I will return to tolteca with visitors to Phoenix craving something authentic.
