I had high hopes for this place and it didn't live up to it. We tried 2 rolls, the crab one and a Suzuki.. The crab one was like a soft shell crab roll, delicious but not anything special. Suzuki roll was an overpriced spicy tuna roll with some mayo sauce. We also tried the Mexican style pho which was pretty horrible.. So salty and way too much lime. Didn't even taste like a tortilla soup.. Barley edible. The best thing we had and the only reason I am giving it 3 stars is because the Mexican street corn side was amazing! Great atmosphere so I will maybe go back to drink and try happy hour. I think every restaurant deserves a second chance.
