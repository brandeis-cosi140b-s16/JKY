Even though I live very close, I tried Leticia's for the first time today. Every time I drive by I see hoards of people waiting outside so I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. My friend and I got there at about 5pm on Friday. It wasn't too busy yet although there was a bit of a wait and the small lobby area was full. After waiting about 15 minutes we were seated in the dining area. It's super crowded- tables are very close to each other in an almost claustrophobic way. We were served chips and salsa first. I notice other reviewers raving about the chips, and I almost wonder if we were served something different than everyone else? The chips we got tasted like any tortilla chips you could buy at the grocery store and were not warm as some stated. The salsa didn't stand out as anything different than what you'd get from Chipotle or Zabas. I ordered the "build your own burrito" and my friend ordered the shrimp tacos. My burrito was made as ordered with red sauce "enchilada style" and carne asada inside. I agree with other reviews that the food was quite salty and to me the carne asada was really fatty. The serving sizes were large which was good considering that I found the prices to be a little on the high side for the type of restaurant this is. My friend said that her shrimp tacos were tasty but nothing to write home about. Frankly, I actually prefer Zaba's burrito over the one I had at Leticia's for less than half the price. The service was quick and friendly. There was nothing inherently bad about our visit, but I do think that this place is way overrated. Would not be first on my list when I'm looking for Mexican food.
