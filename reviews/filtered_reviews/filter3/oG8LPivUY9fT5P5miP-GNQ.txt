The good: Margaritas, fresh tortillas, service.
The bad: bland, over-priced food.  Don't put a pepper beside a dish on the menu representing a "spicy" dish and then have it be bland of flavor and heat.  I had the pork chili verde and the pork was boiled and tough.  
I really did want to like this place more-the ambiance is great and if you just want to meet up with friends for some nachos and drinks, then you will be fine.  But, if you want to go and have a good meal....there are many better choices in the area.
