I fly Southwest, so Vegas is a frequent connection. This place serves a good Margarita in a pint glass at a price I expect at the airport ($15). Skip the chips and salsa. The salsa is good but the chips will crack a tooth they're so hard. The chicken enchiladas were good. All the topping and corn tortilla flavors were there but the chicken was very simple (though tender). I'll eat here again
