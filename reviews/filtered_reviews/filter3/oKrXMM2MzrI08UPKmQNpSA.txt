I REALLY wanted to like this place. Actually  I do like the building and the decor and the beautiful courtyard,however the service is very slow. My husbands food was barely warm it took 10 min to warm up then it was over cooked. My fajitas had good flavor and was piping hot but the shrimp and chicken were a bit over done and dry. The people were nice and friendly but we probably will not be back.
