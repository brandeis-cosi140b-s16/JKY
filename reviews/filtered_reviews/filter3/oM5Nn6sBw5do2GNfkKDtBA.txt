I was pretty disappointed in the place after reading son many good reviews and hearing so many good things about the place. I for one wasn't impressed at all. Everything was so so. We ordered the chicken flautas, spicy bulgogi chimichanga, bulgogi enchiladas, quesadilla, and pork belly tacos. The pork belly tacos were the stand out. I would order that again, the rest, just ordinary for me. Not great korean food and not so great mexican food combined....just ok.
