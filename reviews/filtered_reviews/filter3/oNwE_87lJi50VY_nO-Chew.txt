The outside patio of this place is awesome. If you can't get a seat outside then you will be very disappointed if you get stuck sitting inside. It is dark, extremely noisy and to make it worse the music is loud enough to wake the dead and you will never be able to converse with your party much less the servers. The food is very good although I did have a bad experience with the Uncle Buck tacos last night as the oysters were severely undercooked. Like total mush. I've gotten these several times but they were just cooked wrong last night. The drinks are seriously overpriced but they are good, just not worth $9.75 for a tiny cocktail.  Normally the service has been OK but last night we finally had to get up and ask the host to get a waitress to come over to our table after sitting there for 15 minutes with our menus. I would love to give this place five stars, and if I have a better experience when I go back next time, I will delete this review and rewrite it.
