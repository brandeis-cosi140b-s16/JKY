Having driven by numerous times when it was totally packed, I decided to try Sandbar in North Phoenix.

On a Monday night it wasn't that crowded.

Their Happy Hour deals are pretty good...half off on all appetizers.  The peel-and-eat shrimp was only o.k., but the carne asada nachos were really good.  Beers on tap -- no Negra Modelo, but they do have Alaskan Amber and Blue Moon -- are $3 during HH.

The bartender was annoyingly friendly ("Hi I'm Alan" while reaching out to shake my hand), but the service was responsive.

I expected the worst and this was definitely better than that.  I didn't see the douche factor I expected, but I'm holding out judgement until I show up on a night where it's standing room only.
