If it were up to me, I'd probably give Javier's 2 stars, but since my dining companions didn't seem to have as strong of feelings as I did, I gave it an extra star. Situated off of the casino, you feel like you're worlds away inside the restaurant. Graceful arches punctuate the space while exposed beams and a variety of textures curate a dark and brooding, yet elegant ambiance. I really liked the setting itself, I just wasn't a fan of my entree. 

I ordered, as I always do at Mexican restaurants, the chicken fajitas. The presentation was different from most in that there was no steaming skillet, but rather an artfully arranged mini tower of veggies and chicken on my plate. The chicken was marinated in adobo and tasted more like buffalo chicken than Mexican and was SPICY. I wasn't expecting it to be that spicy and was not a fan. It's also on the higher end for chicken fajitas at $27. My dining companions seemed to enjoy their meals so take my opinion with a grain of salt. The margarita was pretty good and reasonably priced at $12. 

I am a frequent Vegas visitor but I doubt I'll return to Javier's. I think that for $250+ for four people there are a zillion other restaurants in Vegas where you get a lot higher quality food for your money. You can dress it up but at the end of the day, it's Mexican food and more expensive isn't always better.
