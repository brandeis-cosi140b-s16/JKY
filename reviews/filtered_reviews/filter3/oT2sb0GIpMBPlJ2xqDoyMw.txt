I go back and forth with Cantina.  Sometimes I go and its great all around, food, service, etc.  Other times the service is laughable and food stinks.  Or just one is off.  I was craving a margarita (not an alcoholic I swear!!)  So before dinner plans at Good Food my friend and I said we'd meet here.

I got there first and walked into the bar area where the couches are.  There was someone cutting fruit and he didn't look up so I asked if I could order a drink from him.  Sure no problem.  So he makes my drink and tells me its $7 and change but I ask to start a tab.  Then my friend called and asked me to order him one, so I went back to the bar and there was a woman there now too.  She apologized and said she'd get me some chips.  She brought the drink to the table and again mentioned the chips and I told her its fine I'm not in a rush.

When the chips came they were fresh and salty and warm, all good things!  The salsa however was unbearably salty and really think, like paste not watery like it usually is.  We had to take it off the table because I kept absentmindedly sticking chips in it and then recoiling from the salt overload.  We told the new server when she came by and she was just like "oh really?"  After another round we closed out to meet my sister for dinner.  Check was $30 for 4 house margaritas.  Is it just me or does that seem pricey?  I'm not usually one to scoff at the price of drinks but that just seemed highish.
