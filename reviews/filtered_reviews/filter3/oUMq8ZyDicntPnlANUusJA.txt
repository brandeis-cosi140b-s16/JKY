The place was a lot of fun because I was with a group of girls and comped drinks kept on coming to our table.

The service and staff were amazingly friendly.  Although I wasn't there for the food, it wasn't too bad.  In fact, I don't remember much of what I ordered but it was only from the appetizer menu. 

The place does get really busy, so make sure you call for reservations.
