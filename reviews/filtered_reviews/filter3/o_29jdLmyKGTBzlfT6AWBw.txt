Have attended a couple of networking events here. It's a great space for events like that. The food is pretty good. I've had the southwest salad, which could use just a little more kick in the dressing, but it's hearty and packed with veggies. I also had the queso with pork appetizer. Again very hearty, I liked it. 

The prices are also very reasonable, so I recommend trying it out.
