The good, the bad, and the spicy...

The good
- fun, lively atmosphere. Funny signs, Christmas lights, classic rock. I felt like I was in Rocky Point.
- the host and busboy were very nice.
- good salsa but HOT. I mean I like my salsa spicy (I despise the tomatoey gringoish salsas served in chain restaurants) but this stuff made me have to go to the bathroom and blow my nose twice. More on the bathrooms later...
- my chili relleno plate was very good. The chili sauce was on top was delicious. I was scared it would be super hot but it was just hot enough. Beans and rice that accompanied it were just okay.
- my hubby liked his shrimp dish. 
- good price for a pitcher of Mexican beer.
- they leave you with a pitcher of water to cool down your mouth.

The bad
- our server sucked. He had a personality of a robot. He barely did any of the work either. He just took our order. The nice busboy seemed to do the rest.
- this place really nickel and dimes you. They charge you for a chips and salsa refill. And they only provide one free refill of soda. 
- prices are kind of high for how small the portions are. My plate had one small chili relleno and a small amount of rice and beans. My husband's plate was really tiny. Mexican food should not be this expensive!
- the bathrooms had NO toilet paper in either stall. And were really dirty.
- stomach issues afterwards. Maybe it was because of the spice level, I don't know. But it was an unpleasant night of sleep.
