This place was fantastic when i have been there in the past and the food is still good (love the mini tacos and the avocado bowl is well worth it for your chips and dinner side) but the service this time was sooooooooooo bad that it made it all seem not worth repeating!   They jam people into this place and over seat them and then you wait... for your order to be taken, for your food to arrive and even for the chips and salsa!  We came on a weekend when they are really busy - but they should have the staff to be prepared for that.    So in the future we will not come during their busy times!
