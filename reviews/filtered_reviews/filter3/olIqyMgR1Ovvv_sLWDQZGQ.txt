Nice place to grab a bite for lunch.  It's located in the Fashion Square Mall.  That's the worst part about this place, the parking.  It's not an easy in/out.  So don't plan a working lunch here unless you want to deal with it.

My favorite dish here is the Hickory Burger, $10.75.  It's a pretty big Burger and it comes with Steak Fries.  It will fill you up nice.

It's never too busy at lunchtime and we enjoy sitting on the "patio" out in the mall....makes for great people watching.

Staff is so/so....lot's of college age kids who's first job serving is here, so the service is inconsistent.

Overall it's A-OK.
