So they lost a reservation for 9, really.  It took a bit of negotating but they ended up putting us in a private room.  Thank god because it is loud in there. 

The restrant is really cool inside.  There are fishtanks with no fish just bubbles.  Neat bar with the most extensive tequilla list I have seen.  Chairs were comfortable.  

They did tableside guacamole and that was really rather bland. The show of it was not great either, he stood in the doorway and we saw nothing.  

The highlight of the meal was seriously the coffee.  They serve it with shaved chocolate.  

The food was okay, less then Agave but more expensive(its the strip so what do you expect).  

I dont think I would come back because it was really loud and nothing stood out.  It wasnt terrible just A OK!
