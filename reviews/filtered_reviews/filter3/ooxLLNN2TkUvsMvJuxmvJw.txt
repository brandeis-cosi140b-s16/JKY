Ventured off to Mi Amigo's with mi amigos for lunch today and had an A-OK pleasant experience. Big place, nice size menu and pretty decent speed on bringing the food out ( i was clock watching , since it was just a lunch break). Lunch prices are very reasonable. I had the veggie burrito. Very tasty and very filing. Zucchini, spinach, carrots,, peppers, rice etc.. loved the variety of the ingredients. Mi amigos enjoyed their dishes as well. ( yes you get free chips and salsa to start- i know you were thinking about it). 
They have happy hour 3-6 and indoor/outdoor seating as well. 

Overall..pretty average food....not bad and not the greatest. Will it stop the rumbling in yo' tummy without breaking your budget? Word.
