We usually prefer the more hole in a wall kind of Mexican, but got a coupon in the mail so decided to check Blue Adobe Grille out.  The servers were a bit overwhelmed by the lunch rush (it was later explained to me that one did not show up for work).  The room's large and comfy.

We ordered the Santa Fe where you get to choose uno or dos items out of a selection of enchiladas, tacos, burros, tamales, etc. - we picked the carne adovado and lobster tamale ($9.50 plus "Up Charge" of $1.50 for the lobster).  And also the Soup and Salad: Posole and Adobe Salad.

Verdict:
4 stars: Lobster Tamale - generously filled with large chunks of lobster
3 stars: Adobe Salad - plain solid
2 stars: Carne Adovado - pork itself is quite bland and the sauce tastes like the adobo sauce I get from a can
2 stars: Posole - bland especially after having the complimentary chips and spicy salsa
 
If all we had ordered was the Lobster Tamale, this could've been 5 stars.
