I'd love to stretch to 4 stars on this one but I just can't. For Mesa, it's about as good as it gets. Great location off Val Vista, food is above average, drinks well made. Staff is very friendly and attentive.

Not sure what it is, it's just missing something? The bar is usually the happening place. Great for small/medium groups as you can score a seat almost any night of the week.
