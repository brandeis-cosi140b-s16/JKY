12 inches of doughy glory covered in fiery red picante sauce.

I sit here at my desk sipping my to go cup of hot sauce thinking about what to say and how to rate this place.

The food was good, the prices were decent (I've seen better value), the ambiance is less than elegant, and the location is not exactly convenient.

The negative notes aside, the menu is full of classics and interesting options like the foot long burrito.

Their array of fountain drinks surprised me, it included the usual coke and Pepsi products, there was also unique flavors like apple and strawberry soda. There were also augas frescas in a refillable fountain format. 

Hot sauce is dispensed out of ketchup style pumps into small paper thimbles, luckily my side oder of chips ($1.50) gave me a 4oz cup of sauce that  I refilled several times (and am drinking from as I write this and sweat)
The hot is is pretty good, a dark red, with spices and seeds visible it has a good spice note and a semi thick consistency.

I put this sauce on my foot long potato and bean burrito (4.50) which came with a generous helping of cheese to my surprise.

Overall it was a neat experience, I would go again but I am not in any real rush to go.
