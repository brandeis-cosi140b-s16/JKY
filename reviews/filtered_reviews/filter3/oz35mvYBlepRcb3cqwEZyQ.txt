First of all, I want to start by saying "good job" with the menu. Their entrees are all named after movies. It actually made me laugh. Another thing that made me chuckle; $4.00 (or$4.25) for a single taco. Anyway, started with the chips and queso. The queso was good, but it was a bit runny. I guess I prefer mine so it actually stays on the chip. For my entree I got the "stage 5 clinger", the "long duk dong" and the "I'll have what she's having."  The long duk dong, which was a Korean style steak taco, was the clear winner in the group. It had the most meat and most flavor of my trio. Now, the "I'll have what she's having?"  Totally underwhelming. It came with a tiny strip of dry mahi mahi that I would be embarrassed to serve. Seriously, the avocado slice was bigger than the fish. 

Between the movie references and the creative tacos, I wanted to love this place, but I feel like it just missed the mark. With a few minor tweaks, I really think I could love it. 

The server was terrific though.
