The tacos were very spicy. I liked the chips and salsa but my son and daughter-in-law Felt it was average. Service could have been better. Sean and Nat did not get all rice as requested and I was given all beans also instead of all rice. I said no pico and there was the pico on my tacos. Just make sure you have plenty of time to catch your flight Gluten free options and other locations have gluten free menu.
