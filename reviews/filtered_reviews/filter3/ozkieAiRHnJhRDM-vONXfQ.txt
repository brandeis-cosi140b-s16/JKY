Great tacos...5 stars...had the shrimp tacos and my wife had the mahi...both were fab and so were the fries and chips/salsa.  Atmosphere seems like it would be fun in the evening too.
So, why the mediocre review...the service (ZERO stars) and the watery margarita...which was properly removed from my bill so kudos there.
Anyway, the young lady bar-tending this past Sunday had about the worst attitude I've experienced in awhile.  Even though we said thank you to everything she threw in front of us, I didn't hear one "your welcome."  She also copped and attitude when I didn't know the menu inside and out and asked a few questions.  Seriously?  It was Sunday afternoon and about 5 people were in the joint so its not like she was busy.  Just a terribly grouchy person that needs some customer service classes.  Oh but wait, she was sooo nice when handing me my credit card back for me to fill in her tip amount.
I'll go back but will definitely not sit at the bar if she's around.
