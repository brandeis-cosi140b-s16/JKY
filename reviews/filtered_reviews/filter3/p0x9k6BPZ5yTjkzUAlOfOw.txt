The margaritas and guacamole are my two favorite things about this cute, colorful Tempe restaurant. Be sure to try the strawberry margarita and the guacamole is an absolute must. It's sweet and has a unique taste. And when fall is in the air, be sure to enjoy this combo on the restaurant's darling patio. Mucho Gusto is a fun place to spend happy hour with a group of friends.
