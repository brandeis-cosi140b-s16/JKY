The food is great, but the service is slow. Be prepared to wait to get through the line if going at lunchtime. The cornbread and the short rib is full of flavor and perfect amount of spice. Getting a mix of the green and red sauce is a perfect way to top your enchilada. The cookies are delicious, but my last three visits they have been out.
