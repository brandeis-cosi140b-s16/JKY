I miss the old El Sombrero. This place isn't bad unless you mind that it looks like an IKEA exploded inside. But the decor isn't my main concern. I'm sad that the Mom and Pop feel to the menu is gone. It's a bistro fine I get it. The food is good but it's not the Mexican food that I was looking for on this particular day. The waiter was nice.  At least I know what to expect the next time. If you want good stick to your ribs, bad for you food head over to Casa Don Juan or one of the Lindos in town.
