Great food, awful service. Every time I come here I feel like I'm speaking Martian to the waitress.  Recent example: we finally stumble thru getting her to comprehend our order, only took 4 minutes to order a plain burger and a davids burger and two drinks, she comes back about 5 minutes later with one drink and then spends the next 7 minutes bussing tables.  Then we tried to explain to her what Mr Pib is, despite it being right on the menu. Ordering anything was like pulling teeth.  Also had to send our check back twice... Don't come here if you don't have patience.
