I would give them 5 stars alone for their back patio (EAT THERE IF YOU ARE GOING) otherwise their food is pretty average at best and pricey for what you get. The service is always good, but every time I have been I always feel rushed. The good side is your food doesn't sit in the window getting cold, but the bad is you go from salsa, food, check super quickly. They charge you for refills of salsa/chips which is lame, considering every other Mexican restaurant gives them to you for free.
