First impression of this place is hard to over come but I felt it was really over priced for Mexican cuisine.  Maybe I didn't indulge in too much of the menu where some would say I should have ventured to and would have had a better meal, but I kept it simple and went with my norm for trying out a new mexican restaurant.  
We started off with the critically acclaimed guacamole that stated is "prepared at your table" and costs over 11$.  It was good and was composed of the basic recipe, avocados, tomato, onion etc. but had a sweetness of pomegranate  to it that I wasn't a huge fan of.  It certainly wasn't worth 11$, which is the highest I ever had to pay for guacamole and it certainly wasn't prepared at my table as it stated.   

I had a few different varieties of the tacos which were actually good, better than most street tacos I've had in the past especially the Carne Asada.  The conchinita pibil definitely made a great taco, but I'm sure the dinner plate would have been a better choice to get the full flavor of the pork.  Over all it was good but like I said it a bit over priced for 3 tacos and fries.  

I enjoyed the atmosphere and I'm sure if I went back and tried a few of their drinks and their seafood menu id have a better idea of what this place has to offer.  Over all it was a good, I plan on going back and trying more of the menu but i would probably pass on the guacamole.
