I've eaten here a number of times.  The small plates are usually decent.  Just a tip, don't order the Pork chop.  It's very thick and mine was completely raw on the inside.  I sent it back to be fired again and when it was returned it was seared on the outside but still completely raw on the inside.  Pork + raw = trichinosis.  I don't want worms.  Our server was very attentive however and recommended that it be comped to the manager.  The manager came over and mentioned that they would take care of the pork chop, but he seemed kind of put out by it.  No apology whatsoever.  I left a huge raw chop sitting on the table.  This service is atypical, but after waiting kind of long for the food, you think it would have been cooked enough.
