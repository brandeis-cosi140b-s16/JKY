Chicken burrito and bean and cheese burrito are very good, but if you're getting them to go, be prepared for some mess, especially if they are placed vertically in a bag, wrapped not in aluminum foil but in paper. Chicken is good quality, with chopped up tomato/salsa inside.  Chips and salsa are quite good, but chips were inexplicably placed loose in the to-go bag on top of the burritos, requiring some messy digging to get to the burritos.  Mangos' staff is very courteous.
