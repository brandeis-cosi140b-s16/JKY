Rosita's is pretty average. I probably stop in once a year, I stopped in the other week on the way to Gammage to catch 9 to 5. 

There is nothing outstanding about this place, but nothing to terrible either. 

the chips and salsa are always good and plentiful, but they are just ships and salsa, its hard to mess them up. 

I always get the same thing, a green corn tamale and a shredded beef taco. I like them. 

The service is hit and miss. Last week was horrendous. Our waitress was no where to be found, never checked on us to see if the food was ok or if we needed anything and we waited for ever to get the bill and had to flag her down to have her take our payment. 

When I go here I don't ever have high expectations, so I am generally not let down.
