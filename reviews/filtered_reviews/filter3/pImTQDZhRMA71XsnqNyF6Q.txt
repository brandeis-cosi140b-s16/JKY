Their specialty drinks like the jalape√±o & raspberry margaritas were yummy!!  Food was good the rice & beans had no flavor Chicken dishes we above average. The best part was our lovely server who has to be one of the nicest servers we've come across in a while in Vegas!! She made the start to #vegasNYE evening all the more perfect! Ambiance is nice located on the canals of the Venetian. So in summery go for ambiance and quick bit to eat this place hits the spot...
