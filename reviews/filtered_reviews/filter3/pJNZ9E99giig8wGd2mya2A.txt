Very cute place inside.
Food was good, but not great. 
Service was pretty bad. 
*No children's menu*

I ordered 2cheese enchiladas with an order of beans and rice. $12.99. I did enjoy everything, the sides of rice and beans were kinda small. 
Zordon got the wet super burrito with green sauce. Rice, beans.  $13.99. The burrito was smaller than most and wasn't very good.
My littles got the flautas combo.  $13.99.. because they didn't have a children's menu.

Service: they all looked sad. Like they didn't want to me there. We had to ask them for water several times. They weren't very attentive. Then they sat a family of about 15 right next to us. Really?? They have enough room to leave some space for us. Anyway. Then as we leave the hostesses weren't any better. 

Decor was actually very cute. A little bit weird though, the obsession with Frida. Still, done well. 

I would consider giving this place a second chance if the prices weren't so high for the kind of food i get in any average Mexican restaurant
