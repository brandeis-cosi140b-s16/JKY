I love America's.  I usually always visit the Melrose location and have gave it a 5 star review on here.  Went to this location for the first time in a long time last Saturday.  Boy was that a mistake.  The food was good, as usual, but the service was horrible.  We didn't even get a hello when we walked in and no one else was in there.  They really seemed like they didn't even want to take our order or talk to us.  No eye contact, no pleasantries, nothing.  I will not go back to this location.  Such a difference between the 2 locations!  Every time we go to Melrose they are awesome and know that we are regulars.
