I came here September 1, 2015 for their advertised happy hour with $2.00 tacos!

Upon arrival, the happy hour menu had changed to $3.00 tacos. The advertising outside of the restaurant on the Tvs still said $2.00 tacos. After speaking with my lovely waitress Connie, she said that the happy hour menu had just changed today but the PR team didn't make any of the changes. It makes the restaurant look poorly managed and like they don't have their stuff together.

As far as the food;
Tacos
Al pastor- adobo pork, pineapple jicama salsa: it was the size of my palm, felt small for what I was getting but was flavorful
Ensenada fish- cabbage slaw, chipotle tartar sauce, crema: fried block of fish with the sauce and slaw on top. It was also the size of my palm and it was ok

Mushroom tinga quesadilla- marinated mushrooms in a quesadilla with oaxacan cheese, guajillo sauce and blue corn tortilla- this was delicious. Full of flavor

Service
My waitress Connie was lovely! Very attentive and she felt horribly about the false happy hour advertising.

My only recommendation would be that when they bring out the chips and three salsas that they explain each sauce and what they are.
