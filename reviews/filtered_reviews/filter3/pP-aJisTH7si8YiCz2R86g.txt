Otro is not Gallo Blanco.  Similar menu, but slightly different execution.  My friends and I argue about which we like.  I for one prefer the guacamole at Gallo to the more savory version here at Otro.  However, I think the cocktails are better here and it is much quieter which is great when I want to hear the company I'm with.  At Gallo, (particularly on flamenco nights) it can get a little too crowded to enjoy.  Here at Otro, the vibe is much more relaxed and they have more extensive entrees including mole offerings which you can't find at Gallo.  Definitely worth the trek if you haven't been yet.
