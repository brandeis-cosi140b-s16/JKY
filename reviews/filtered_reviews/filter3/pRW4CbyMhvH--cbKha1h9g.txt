I guess Tee Pee is something of a neighborhood institution. It's been around a while, and it looks that way too. My husband and I shared a plate of steak and shrimp fajitas for lunch around 3pm on a weekday, along with a couple of drinks at happy hour prices. The food here is standardized Mexican-American to the max, but our meal tasted well-prepared and we left feeling pretty stuffed. especially after an additional bowl of chips and spicy salsa. Tee Pee seems like the kind of place where people would go to drink and eat, in that order. Happy hour prices make this an inexpensive place to drink, particularly for that neighborhood.
