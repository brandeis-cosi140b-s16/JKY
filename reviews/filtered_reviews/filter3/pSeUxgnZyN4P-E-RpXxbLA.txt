I came here to eat lunch with my boss and coworker. I had been eating tacos all day because of Taco Tuesday, but I was still craving more. They had a rebel special for UNLV students, so I decided to order that. The special included 4 tacos of your choice and two sides. Due to my passionate love affair with shrimp, I decided to stick with that. They were out of rice, so I was stuck with beans and salsa for my two sides.

When the food came out, it definitely looked appealing. The salsa looked very vibrant and colorful. The shrimp tacos were covered in a beer batter that was cooked to a perfect golden brown. I couldn't wait to take a bite into the foodie goodness.

Once I bit into the taco, I was greatly disappointed. The batter to shrimp ratio was greatly disproportionate. Instead of tasting the shrimp, I tasted batter ..and that's about it. Sure, the food looked pretty, but that was the extent of it's appeal. The salsa was good, but the chips were way too salty. It was all a big let down.

If my coworkers decide to come here for lunch again, i'll probably head over to Baja instead.
