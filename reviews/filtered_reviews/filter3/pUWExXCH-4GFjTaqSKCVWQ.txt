Yummy food!  Service was a little lagging but it was nice sitting in their patio area with our big group.

I will say that they do not have many options that they can make vegetarian, in terms of altering their menu;  however, I liked the portobello mushroom dish I ordered, even though I am not a huge portobello mushroom fan.  Drinks were really yummy, so that was a plus.   We all had food coma afterward, which was not good for trying to go out after, but a great meal is always good.

Service was okay but our water glasses were not filled very much and once the food was ordered, they didn't come by much to check on us.  Overall, check it out if you eat meat/fish.  For vegetarians, there are not too many options to check out the menu first before going.
