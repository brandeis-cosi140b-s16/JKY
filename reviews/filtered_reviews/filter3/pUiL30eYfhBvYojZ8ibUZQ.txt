First timer at Diego Pope and came highly recommended from my bf! All he talks about are the Brussels sprout nachos and they exceeded my expectations. 
Our server Ben was great! 
Now for the bad. The $14 Margarita was weak. Also, There was a pub crawl, which I'm cool with! But they were obviously louder than normal and pretty obnoxious. The thing that made me mad was the manager apologized to every table by us. And gave out comps to those customers and not us. Probably because we were younger and the other tables were older crowds. 
All in all the food and the waiter were  awesome but the overall experience was not too great today.
