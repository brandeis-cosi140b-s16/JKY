Did a little Taco Shop pub crawl around OldTown Scottsdale a couple weeks ago (because the first place we went to had tacos the size of... idk something way tinier than a taco should be.) America's Taco Shop was our second stop of the night and I was pretty happy with the size and flavors of the tacos. The Al Pastor was a delightful combo of sweet and savory flavors.

In my opinion, the "taco Tuesday" deal could be a bit cheaper, but I'm not complaining. This location was pretty dingy though. We sat outside to get some fresh air and it was sort of a ramshackled assortment of chairs and tables and there were bugs everywhere (monsoon season), but the strung lights made it appear somewhat quaint.

I would go again, just maybe to a different location next time.
