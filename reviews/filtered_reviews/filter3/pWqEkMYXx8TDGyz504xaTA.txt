The concept is fancy but the flavor, lacking.

Ordered quite a few dishes here to share between 3 people, but nothing stood out that made me want to try again next time I'm in town. The best of the dishes were on the Mexican side of the menu...all the different tacos are average to above average.

Noodles - you automatically want to try the hand pulled noodles right away because theres always fresh noodles being pulled by the chef in the front of the restaurant. However, the dan dan noodles we tried was soggy, no texture and over cooked. ARgh, what a disappointment.

Buns - tasted like it was reheated from the frozen varieties.

Is it too harsh to say the next best thing to order was the Mexican Coke !!?!
