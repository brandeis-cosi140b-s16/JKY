I admit, I am not a mexican food coniseur, but I have a taste for it every now and then.  Being that I've never eaten at a Macayo's before, I thought I would give it a shot this time, and sit down and eat here at this location.

On the good side, the place is very colorfully decorated....lots of bright colors, and plenty of decor to match.  The service was wonderful, and I enjoyed myself while I was here.

The down side, is that I found the food a bit pricy, and I wasn't all that impressed.  I ordered 2 tacos and a cup of tortilla chicken soup.  The cup was rather tiny, and was a bit disappointed with the small portion.  It was good, but a bit spicy for my taste.  The tacos were good, but honestly, Ive gotten bigger, better tasting tacos from Filbertos at half the price.

I could see myself coming here more as a happy hour guest, or bringing some out of town friends here to enjoy the decor and get a taste for some of thier food, but not as a regular customer.  I don't think its bad, I just feel that the food was just okay and it was a bit overpriced for what I felt like I got.
