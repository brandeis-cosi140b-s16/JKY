I've been reading the reviews about this place and I can somewhat understand the judgments about it but my friend and that came through to this spot over at the Westgate Mall had a good experience.

I was in the mood for Tex-Mex so we pretty much settled for Calico's. Definitely was not crowded here, hence probably because of the reviews it has received. Good points about Calico Jack's: despite the lack of waiters here the service was very g ood from the waitress we had. My friend had a chicken burrito while I had a shrimp burrito. Added to that I requested a pomegranate margarita and I don't remember how the convo came about for some pineapple mix to be added to it but the waitress did that for me as well. EVERYTHING came out great. The shrimps in the burrito were huge and fresh. I have no complaints at all about the food nor the service.

If I have anything negative to say about Calico's is that they do need a bigger staff eventhough there was not a huge crowd in the restaurant. But it was a Saturday and it was nice so it should be beyond necessary for there to be more than one or two waiters attending to patrons. Also some updated furniture would do the place justice. Other than that not really anything bad to say about Calico Jack's.
