Here's my thing about PINK TACO.. They really have to do better on the quality of food they are trying to sell as Mexican style cantina feel! For me I've been here twice now and I really just feel like this place is a sorry excuse for Mexican food! It has no flavor and the tacos are bland as all hell. Want to talk about inflation of price? I clearly don't mind paying for what I get and of course things will be over expensive in a casino restaurant but you are almost at like $20 for 3 small tacos.. The nachos are probably the best thing on the menu. I just recently was here and ordered the burrito meal which comes with black beans and again for $15 this burrito should be much more tasteful! I could go get two carne asada burritos from Roberto's or 2 bigger burritos from chipotle for the price and have it to much well worth it!
