Great happy hour specials.  Margaritas were decent, chips and salsa free but the food was gross. It was your typical mexican bar food nothing at all special or delicious in any way. I can see it as a place where you might end up eating only if your wasted and starving. The service was slow too even though we were a group of 6 with only 4 other people in the bar.
