I love the chips here...I have for years...I am addicted. Last month we went for dinner to feed my quest for fish tacos. The service was great, we sat at the bar. He recommended a cilantro sauce for the tacos. I decide to try that. Overall, I was not overly thrilled with the fish tacos, or the sauce, but they weren't absolutely horrible either.  Average. I didn't like the sauce because I don't care for a TON of cilantro, but this my taste, and I don't take stars away for that.  

We also went last Friday night and I got a taco, tostado and enchilada combination. They were also ok, I would have liked to have more flavor in the enchilada. I tried the chicken, beef and Machaca beef. I have to say, I really liked the Machaca beef. the taco was ok, I would get that again. I would pass on the other stuff though.  

In my opinion, the food is average. Great atmosphere, great chips/salsa, great 'bulk' food service. Service can also be a little hit or miss...nice gal the other night...not great timing....great service when we sat at the bar last month. 

As for the fish taco's....I am still searching....
