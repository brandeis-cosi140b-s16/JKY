I was forced into trying a new place for lunch today at work, so it was Frank & Fina's Cocina because of the good reviews here on yelp.

The food was a great value and tasty.

I had the chicken burrito-plain and a water so lunch was inexpensive.  The total for my portion without tip was $7.50 + tax.

Soon after we sat down, the standard salsa and chips appetizer was at our table.  Our orders were taking promptly.

The food came out ultra hot (which is a good thing) and in under 3 minutes it seemed.

The chicken burrito was a flour tortilla stuffed with just chicken and there wasn't a single hint of grease in my burrito. Perfect!

On the sides were a garnish of onions and tomatoes, re-fried beans in a taco shell bowl and a mound of Spanish rice.

I took a few bites of the burrito then proceeded to stuff rice and the onions/tomatoes inside. It was very good.

I would've given 4 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I was digging in my cup for ice towards the end of my meal.

The food, however, begs for me to give this place a try again.
