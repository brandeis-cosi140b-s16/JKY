This place is hit or miss. I've had several of the small plates and sometimes they are tasty and others not so much. However, you can never go wrong with the Roasted Garlic plate - beware though! You will reek of garlic the next day, so indulge in this on a Saturday night maybe, so you can stay in Sunday. Also the GCP (green chile potato) is excellent. 

Downfall: too pricey for what it is, and the service could be better.
