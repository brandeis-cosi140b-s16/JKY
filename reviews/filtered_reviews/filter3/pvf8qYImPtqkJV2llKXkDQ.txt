The food was very good. The drinks were very good. But the music was horrific. Really bad dance music. Loud. Bad. I guess I am not hip enough. This is the first miss from this restaurant group. I would get a taco from the street seats, but no way would I subject my ears to this place again. Wow. Did not expect this.
