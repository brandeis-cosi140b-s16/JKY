Went to this Restaurant Sunday for lunch.  From the outside the place looks clean and a nice place to stop and eat.  We walked in and I walked around to see if there were any servers or if we just ordered and picked up our own food.  I found someone that worked there and they said just to sit anywhere.  I noticed the place was pretty empty on a Sunday, only about 3 other tables were full.  We sat for a couple of minutes when our waitress walks up and hands us some menu's and takes our drink order.  A couple minutes later our drinks arrive and a basket of chips and two types of salsa are served.  Right away I notice the chips are fresh, seemed like they were made that day.  They were nice and hot and just seemed really fresh, very salty but I like mine that way so I was good.  Looking around the surroundings looked very colorful, lots of different colored walls to look at.  They have booths or tables to sit at, and the place looked clean from where I was sitting.  
I ordered chicken flautas al cart and a soda.  My husband got a beef chimichanga and their flavored Ice Tea.  Our food was served pretty fast and was hot.  I got a couple of flautas served on a heaping bed of lettuce with a side of guacamole.  My flautas were pretty good.  The chicken tasted fresh but the flavor needed a little boost of something, can't put my finger on it.  But it was pretty good.  
I tasted my husbands and it was good.  The prices at this place were reasonable, $7-$12 a plate.  The place was a quiet sit down place on a Sunday afternoon.
