Unfortunate name change for them. Las Vegas, the land of biscuits and gravy dirt bikers, will have a hard time pronouncing Jalisco Cantina. 

I had a combo plate. 2 enchilada's and 1 chile relleno with Mole. I asked 3 times for the extra spicy salsa, the first 2 times they brought the red salsa that tasted more like ketchup. The food was good, just not great but for the money, I'll take it. 

They no longer serve tostada shells in their "chips n salsa", now they actually bring you chips! Kinda sucks, I had fun breaking up the tostada shells.
