Wanted to grab a bit of Mexican food close to the sports book and this was in the proximity.  

This place doesn't have the best reviews, but thought let's give it a shot.  Took a bit to get someone to take our order and the manager was in the neighborhood, so he took the order.  

Started off with the ceviche and tortilla chips.  The ceviche is very bland and almost no flavor at all as it has tiny pieces of cod mixed in with tons of tomatoes, bits of onions and a few thin slices of avocado.   If you like bland ceviche, you will love it, if you like flavor add some Cholula or Tabasco hot sauce.  

Also ordered the fajitas and came with a tiny portion size for $20.  The steak was flavorful and tender and the chicken was good as well.  

Tried a sample of their margaritas and they were either too sweet or had too much lime.   I like a good strong margarita and these were too off the chart for me to order. Guess I'm used to the best frozen margarita in the land at Ztejas, in Costa Mesa, Ca.  

Overall, the meal wasn't bad, but far from parable or great.  The service aspect of this restaurant definitely needs to be addressed, but I wouldn't expect any changes in the near future.  If you are not in a hurry and don't mind waiting, then it might work
for you here.  If not, I would move on down the road for something quicker and tastier.
