Delicious food!! The Sea Bass was amazing. I would have given this place 5 stars; however, we went here for my birthday and they surprised us by bringing out flan with a lit candle and singing "Happy Birthday". After they brought my dessert, they asked others if they wanted dessert so we put in some orders. The birthday surprise was a very nice touch... Until the bill came. They had charged us full price for the dessert! We had not ordered the dessert nor had we asked for a birthday dish. I'd never been to a restaurant that charged for a birthday dessert, especially one that wasn't asked for. I could see if they charged for a dessert that was ordered but they brought it out before even showing us the dessert menu! Super tacky in my book...
