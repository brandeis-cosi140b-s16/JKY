Entrees are notable here, one of the following two should be in your future.  First, the Blue Cali Burrito - spinach tortilla filled with rice, jalapeno beans, guacamole, sour cream, shredded lettuce and pico.  Second, the Tres Enchiladas- 3 corn tortillas filled and topped with jalapeno sauce, chipotle cream sauce, red chili sauce cheese (rice/beans on side).   

Spinach con queso dip is above average as well, and some good deals can be had at happy hour.  Otherwise, prices are a little high and it's not a very charming location in a strip mall between a furniture store and border's books.
