I went here because I had a gift certificate.  I ordered their shrimp taco and a chicken burro.  The shrimp taco was delicious (great sauce), small but it packed a punch. It was priced at under $5.  I would re-order this but only if I wanted to splurge.  The chicken burro was not very tasty.  I don't recall it being moist or maybe I had to use one of the sauces to have a better experience?  It had a nice beach patio, but it was so close to the busy Chandler Blvd.  It can be dark inside so watch your step. A plus is their own parking lot!
