It has been awhile since my taste buds have been assaulted by the grand poobah of New Mexican cuisine, but the memory is still fresh in my mind.  It's kind of like the first time you had sex  -- it may not have been that pleasant of an experience, but you'll never forget it. 

Los Dos Molinos is a spicy food lovers dream. If you like to sweat while you eat and like to eat jalapenos like they're M&Ms, then by all means get yourself to Los Dos. The food is THAT spicy, but it isn't too overpowering, that is, if you pick the right entree. I've had their red cheese enchiladas, and they ARE muy caliente. And, you think the beans will cool off your tongue? Nope, those are laced with jalapenos as well. The only way to truly cool off the explosion of spice in your mouth is with a nice, cold, frozen or on the rocks Margarita.

Overall, I enjoy Los Dos for what it is -- an adventure for my taste buds. I have to say, though, it isn't a place I could go to on a regular basis; I don't think my stomach could handle it. But, it is a fun place to take those out-of-town guests who've never experienced real Southwestern food. They'll leave with either a smile or a scowl. But whichever way, they'll never forget it!
