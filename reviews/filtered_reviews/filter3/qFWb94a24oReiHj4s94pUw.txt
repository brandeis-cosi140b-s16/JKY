This is a tough review to write, because I've loved this place forever, but something's going on recently, and not for the better. It's still good, and I'd still recommend it, but it's on the decline. New management?

I've been going here for a few years, probably a dozen times total over three years. Early on, it was an amazing find for Tempe: An inventive Mexican menu, with fresh ingredients well prepared, in a cool Southwestern space.

Unfortunately, this year my visits have included a number of red flags. First, they got rid of their heat lamps - so what could be, and used to be, an awesome patio environment was just DEAD through most of the winter. When we braved the outside one evening anyway, we sat by the (dead gas) fire and had to ask for it to be turned on. ???

The service, while not bad, has just lacked something in recent months. Energy? Engagement? We get seated. We order. We get our food. We pay the check. We leave. We were there last week - forced to sit inside because of the lack of heat lamps - and were told to sit at the bar to wait for a table. We sat at the bar using the three open seats, and the bartender promptly told us we couldn't sit there because we were blocking the bar. When the server had just seated us there??? We had had enough but the hostess caught us on our way out because a table had just opened.

Some bright spots remain: half price drinks and apps during happy hour, cool outdoor patio when it's warm, and a menu refresh that includes skewers that are really, really good. Also try the Green Chile Nachos.

This was a five start place at one time, was a four even in recent years, but is now a three, and it's slide may not be over. Breaks my heart...
