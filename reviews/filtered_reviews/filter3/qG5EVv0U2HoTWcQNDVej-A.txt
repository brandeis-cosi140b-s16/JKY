I don't understand the draw of this place. The atmosphere is fun and staff are great, but the food just isn't that outstanding. I had three tacos: carne asada (meat was tough), shrimp (tastes like algae), and I can't even remember the third which is a bad sign. Also, the prices are such that you're paying at least $1 per bite. I much prefer Phoenix Burrito House which is a better value and has tastier food! OK, I will say the sopapillas here are delicious. I'll give them that.
