Not too shabby for Mexican food.  I've been looking for good Mexican restaurants being that I'm from Southern New Mexico and have been craving authentic Mexican food.

The chips n' salsa weren't bad at all, nothing special (again this review is coming from someone who KNOWS good Mexican food, but hey its all opinion right?) but they did give you three salsas to dip from.

We had chicken quesadillas as an appetizer (you have to be a moron to screw up heating two flour tortillas together with cheese and chicken, luckily they weren't).  These were good and I have no complaints.

For dinner I ordered the Mojado Burrito.  The waiter told me this was the most food I could get (hey, I'm 6'7'' and I was dang hungry aight?).  It was smothered in some sort of red sauce.  You could order the burrito with chicken, steak, carnitas (pork), or vegetarian.  I ordered it with pork and my friend ordered it with chicken.  The burrito was very tasty, I ate every last bight.  Overall the food was pretty tasty and actually better than what I expected, the three stars was for the service.  Our waiter was awful.  Our drinks were empty for almost the entire meal.  Looking around the restaurant I noticed the same thing.  "I'll be right back with some more water" means "Hey, I'm going to go chill in the corner for 10 minutes and then remember to give you a refill."  Most people have given this place 4 stars for the food, you have to remember I'm a New Mexican and I know good Mexican food when I taste it =).  

Prices were about $10-15 per plate.  If you are staying in the Hard Rock Casino I would definitely go give this place a try.  This place was a little noisy though and I found it hard to hear my friend talking to me, other than that go get your fix of some pink taco!
