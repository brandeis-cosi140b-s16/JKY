Today was my 2nd visit to Barrio Queen and but for the amazing food I would probably not go again.  The service was, well, not awesome. What was worse was most of the staff talking to each other. We were seated in the bar and the bartender was completely in the weeds. Hey, that happens and he was a nice enough guy. But why no one stepped up to help or even seemed to notice is beyond me. We just waited forever for everything and people are all huddled up talking about whatever....(sigh). 

Outside of that our food was amazing, just delicious. I had the Queen enchilada with crab and it was to die for. The Birthday girl had Cochinita Pibil which she loooved. I had sangria (yummy) and TBG had a mimosa. 

To sum it up, yes the food is wonderful, but with out good service it means nothing.
