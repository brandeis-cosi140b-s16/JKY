I had been to the Lindo Michoacan near the strip, so my family and I wanted to try this one.  The Lindo Michoacan near the strip set the standard that I assumed all Lindo Michoacans follow.  However, this location did not meet my expectation.  We sat down and had our drink orders taken.  After the waiter brought us our drinks, we didn't see him for 15 minutes.  In that time we had finished our drinks and couldn't get a refill on the drinks or the chips and salsa.  I assume he was busy elsewhere because the wait staff appeared to be understaffed, as a man in a button up shirt and khaki trousers who appeared to be the manager was bringing dishes out to people's tables.  The man in the button up eventually motioned our waiter to our table and our waiter took our order.  The food came a little while later.  The food was fantastic, as it is at both locations I have been to.
