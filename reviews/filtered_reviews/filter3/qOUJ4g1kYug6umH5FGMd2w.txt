I'll keep this one brief:

I love the food here, particularly the carne asada (in any form).  They also have good daily drink specials.  Love the upstairs balcony and  deck- rain, shine, snow, it's open (and covered/heated/etc. when it needs to be).

I think I'm a little old to hang out here on Friday and Saturday nights.  The crowd seems to be grad students and young professionals- like well under 30.  I like to be able to sit- instead of stand around at a bar.

Anywho, try it out and judge for yourself.
