I would give Someburros a 4, but I feel like it would be misleading. In my mind a 4 is a "I need to go there" rating. Someburros is more of  a "If you want mexican food and you're nearby" type place

Another reviewer said it best; this is a 'tweener place - better than fast food, not as good as a sit-down... which I actually find perfect.

While they're food is perfectly acceptable, I will say that it's easy to spend more than you need to here. I've gotten a few of there combos of burritos, tacos, etc, and while they're good, you are probably going to cross (or very nearly cross) the $10 mark once you add a drink. personally I think the most underrated thing on the menu is the Mexican Pizza. It's a 14" cheese crisp with green chili beef, tomatoes, and green onions. It has plenty of flavor, it's def. filling, and it's cheap - $4.80. (this is also perfect Hangover Grub.) Add a small drink, the comp. chips, and you've got a pretty great meal for a hair under 7 bucks. Not the healthiest option in the world, but hey...
