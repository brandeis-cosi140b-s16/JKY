This is a solid, but certainly not fantastic, dining experience that is enhanced by being adjacent to the canal at Venetian.  We always get the 3 taco plate, which I guess is as close to a "bargain" as you can get on the strip.  My favorites are fish and pork, with the pork having a very good pineapple salsa.  The queso fundido has been an appetizer we go back to several times over.  The chorizo is a good addition, but can be greasy, so be advised.  Also, the cheese hardens fairly quickly, so this is an appetizer I wouldn't linger over.

Standard Mexican beer selection and some margarita choices.  It's a fun way to not lose your shirt on dinner on the strip.
