A little run down from when I was there about 10 or so years ago but the food and service was very good! Margaritas ok and the $25.00 dollar Cadillac with aged Grand Mariner good but didn't quite make the $25 price in size or taste even with the nice glass to take home! Pretty slow and quiet but what isn't  in PHX in August!!
