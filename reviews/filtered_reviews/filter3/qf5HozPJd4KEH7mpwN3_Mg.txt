Had my first experience here and it was really good. I started off with a Mango Cayenne margarita. I was really curious about the combination but it was quite good. Just the right amount of heat from the cayenne/salt rim to add spice but not overwhelm the drink.

The chips and salsa were good, but nothing spectacular. 

For the entree I had tex mex tacos with beef, carne and chorizo. The chorizo was particularly good and the other were tasty, though again nothing spectacular. The poblano side was a real star for this meal though. The poblanos were spicy and the cream sauce was delicious. 

This is certainly one of the better Mexican restaurants downtown.
