Stopped in here with a group of guys during a bachelor party.

Food: It's nothing special, Just Ok.

Price: Expensive for that kind of food, don't drink here or you will pay for it later!

The server we had couldn't split our bills in to individual bills, so she kindly told us that she had to group us together. What a bunch of bull, never heard such a thing. Then the bill comes and we had tip added on...

Not much atmosphere, kind of dark, and just OK food. Service is OK.

Go next door to Cheeseburger Cheeseburger....
