Very Nice Hotel...Parking a lillte confusing but we used Valet ( its free! just tip the guys!) We went on a tuesday night it was very quiet... we tried almost everything. The queso fundido con Chorizo so good! Not to greasy I was surprise... the shrimp tacos were Delicious and the braised beef very nice and tender, it could use some more sauce thought! The flame coffee it was a must! after seeing it in almost every table but I wasn't impress :( To much cinnamon and the flavor its not that great... nice show though! I'll come back...
