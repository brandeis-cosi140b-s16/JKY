We have been many times and staff is always friendly and usually efficient. We discovered today that lunch hour isn't the time to go. One bartender couldn't keep up with the drink orders so our first drinks came after food started arriving. Obviously more staff is needed at lunch. My wife was disappointed by the soup. Someone changed the recipe. We will return though. First time we have had service problems. My chopped salad was good. The cheese and shrimp crisp was good.
