Pretty decent place to stop and get a quick bite.

They are very generous with the fillings. The steak and chicken was well seasoned and tender. Everything looked pretty clean and well maintained.

The space is small, so if you see available seating take advantage of it.

The prices are pretty reasonable and the guys that were working here were pretty friendly.
