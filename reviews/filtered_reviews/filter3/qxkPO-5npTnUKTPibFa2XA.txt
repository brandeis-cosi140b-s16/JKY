Not impressed. The only thing I liked about this restaurant was that Frank himself waited on us and I like family owned businesses. The food sadly is mediocre and nothing to write home about. I was greatly dissapointed in the tortillas served with dinner. They were not homeade and tasted as though they were once frozen and re-warmed. The guacamole was bland and also a let down. The atmosphere was dark (a little too dark) with intimate seating arrangments. The children selections were non impressive either. We will not be returning. Pretty low on the authentic mexican food scale for me.
