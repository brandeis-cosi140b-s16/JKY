In my opinion, this place is OK, not great but OK, but well worth coming when it's half price after 11.
Don't get steak anything because the "steak" is as tough as shoe leather, but you should be alright with chicken.  I like Kristy's sister's red velvet enchilada...which isn't red, isn't velvet and I have absolutely no idea what it has to do with someone named Kristy and her sister.  Pretty good most times, sometimes it comes out with the chicken chunks as cold as ice but they'll quickly heat it up for you.  Which indicates that the chicken is kept cold and then "warmed" when they smother it with sauce.  Assuming you can get it warm, it's pretty good (not great but OK) as are most of the chicken menu offerings.
This is not really a Mexican restaurant for those who have lived in LA or Mexico and know what real Mexican food is but the Mad Mex concoctions are, if I may repeat, OK.
Parking is tough around here.  Expect to have to walk from a few blocks away.
I'm not a drinker but it seems that everybody around me gets the Big Azz margaritas and loves them.
