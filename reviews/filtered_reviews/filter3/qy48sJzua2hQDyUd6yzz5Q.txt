This place came highly recommended. It thought it was so so. 

Went here for our last stop during our Arizona weekend. I had a vegetarian burrito, which was actually quite good. My husband had the carne asada burrito, which he really liked. Then I had the corn, which didn't have much flavor at all, even though it was covered in mayo and cheese. 

It does have a great atmosphere and friendly staff. Prices were great.
