This place has some hits and some misses.   The temperature of our food was the major miss.   I had the jade chicken and jerk rice.   The chicken was room temp, there was a decent flavor.  The rice had great flavor.   The black beans were awesome though.   Great spice and heat.   It is definitely a dive but that doesn't mean you can't clean tables.... All of them were trashed (another  miss)
