We popped in for a drink and I bought one of those obnoxious tall drink thingy-ma-bobs and filled it with some sort of frozen concoction the girl behind the counter suggested.  Some folks ordered food, but I had already eaten so I can ony rate my drink experience.  The atmosphere was fun and seemed low key, but we were there early in the day.  Definitely try it out.
