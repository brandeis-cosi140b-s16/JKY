I recently had the chance to go back to Old Pueblo Cafe and found that its a bit more industrial than original.  On this visit, my dining partner had a fish enchilada with rice and beans.  It had the appearance of being hand assembled and she claimed it to be quite tasty.  The beans were good and assisted in making the rice a whole lot better when mixed together.  

My meal was that of a Green Chili Beef Chimichanga.  The same rice and beans were served and they were palatable when mixed together but the Chimi seemed like something that was taken from a frozen food locker and warmed up to be served.  There was nothing fresh made or original about it.  Yes, the filling was flavorful but the presentation and appearance looked pre-packaged and not fresh made.  This is a huge issue for me as Mexican food is very cost effective as well as simple to make in any kitchen.  

The pricing is a bit high as well, especially for food that is pre-made and just warmed up.  Maybe the rent is high in Litchfield but not enough to pay almost $11 for a frozen Chimichanga.  

Cocktails....we both had the house Margarita and while it was tasty, I think $5.95 for a non-call-alcohol made drink at happy hour is a bit much.  The size was OK but the overall quality for the value is still not there. 

Yes, I will go back on occasion as I am local and its about 200 yards from the house but if I am looking for authentic Mexican food, its time to look elsewhere.
