Don't order the queso - it's a big hunk of melted cheese that gets harder and tougher to eat as it cools.  The margaritas use real lime juice, so if you're used to a sweeter margarita, order a fruity one.  

Ricardo was our bartender and he was great!  Friendly, hospitable and engaging!  Chips and salsa were good and they gave us three different types of salsa - yum.
