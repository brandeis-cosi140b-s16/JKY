First timer here, and didn't know that the beef took longer than the chicken to prep. I ordered the combo plate which was 1/4 lb. of beef and 1/4 of a chicken.  I waited about 15 min. while 4 other customers ordered after me and left with their food before me.  Soo, I left, somewhat upset (mainly cause I was hungraay).  I took a peak at my food while I was at a stoplight and it didn't seem like a lot of food either.  I was prepared to give this place a bad review now.  But I finally got to sit an eat my lunch and, that shut me up quick.  The flavors were really good, the onions, beans, fresh salsa, and 3 four tortillas that were included were perfect with the grilled meats, and everything was a perfect portion for a filling lunch.  The prices are higher than the original picture of the menu posted here, but that was 4 years ago.  It's still a good value for the amount of food and the quality as well.  I will be returning for sure.
