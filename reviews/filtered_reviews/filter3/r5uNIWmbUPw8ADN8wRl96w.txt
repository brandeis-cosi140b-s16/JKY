I guest my expectations were real high for this place, I ate and left and wasn't satisfied one bit. The only thing that hit the spot was the cold coke in the glass bottle. We ate everything - there's was about 8 of us at dinner and tried one of everything like we always do. My sister said usually the food is a lot better and the service was average (which she was pretty busy because she was doing it all). We will be back soon and hopefully it will be better next time.
