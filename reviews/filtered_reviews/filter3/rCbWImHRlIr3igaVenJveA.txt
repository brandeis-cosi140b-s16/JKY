Loved the carne, hated the seating arrangement. 

We hit the Coronado location today for lunch and despite planning our meet for 11:30 to increase our chances of landing a table inside we were diverted to Patio City. Huge bummer.

The burrito was all kinds of delicious (and the portion is perfect, unlike the 'roided up burritos found at Qdoba, Chipotle and even Chico's) but sitting at a rock hard, scorching hot picnic table took a bit of the enjoyment away from the experience. 

I understand the converted house is tiny (and that's part of charm), but would investing in some misters downgrade the authenticity? I think not. 

Also, I'm not against any Green initiatives, but delivering food baskets sans napkins is a bad move.

I'll definitely go back for the carne, but probably not anytime before late October.
