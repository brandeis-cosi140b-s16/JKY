Okay, we only came here for the big ass margarita special, but then I got hungry so I got the hummus. Also, I got a beer instead of a margarita, wasn't in the mood for it. Also, tried some of my friend's, but t i didn't really like it, not a tequila fan. Anyways, back to the hummus. I enjoyed the flatbread! It was really good. Yum yum. The hummus wasn't bad. There wasn't too much flavor too it, a tint of garlic. Bit pricey for the amount, but I guess it was okay.
