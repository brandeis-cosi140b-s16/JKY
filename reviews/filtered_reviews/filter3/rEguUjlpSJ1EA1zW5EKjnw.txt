Eh, Sabor could be good. Today's visit was lacking, but not because of the taste of the food. They were out of damn near everything! The first thing the cashier said was basically that they were out of meat and lettuce. How do you run out of meat and lettuce? That's 90% of the menu. I wanted an arepa. You know what I would have been left with? Tomato and cheese in an arepa for $4.25. Yep.

My coworker got a burrito and a soda. But, guess what? He is diabetic and they were out of diet soda (along with two others). Of course he didn't find out until after he paid and went to get said soda. 

They magically found some chicken, so my arepa was saved. I did have to clean off my own table. I'll probably give this place another chance, but damn. I'm disappointed. :/ I wanted it to be good so I'm giving them three stars. Today's visit really deserves only two.
