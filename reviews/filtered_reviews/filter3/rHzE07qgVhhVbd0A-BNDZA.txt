We went here today for lunch and had a pretty good experience. We were attracted by the beautiful outdoor patio and walked in to be told that they didnt have a server working outside. We turned away to leave, as the inside was pretty crowded, and they changed their mind and let us sit outside. The service was great and our sweet waiter kept apologizing for "taking a long time" but we felt that the service was VERY fast! We got two margaritas and two orders of #22 (4 chicken enchiladas - my boyfriend is a copy cat). The margaritas were a little pricey (price not on menu - they came out to $12/each) but were good! They were also very strong! That can be a good or a bad thing based on what you had planned to accomplish after your meal! We had to go shopping next door while they wore off!  I wasnt overly impressed by the main course but my boyfriend was pretty happy. Better than average enchiladas but the sauce wasnt for me.  Overall, lovely patio, quick service, decent food but nothing blew me out of the water.

UPDATE: Came again a few months later on a Tuesday evening. Got the chicken fajitas and once again, was not all that impressed. Very basic. I dont plan to return after two medicore visits, unless I need one of those powerful margaritas!
