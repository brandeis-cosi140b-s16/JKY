Co-worker really liked his steak/chicken fajitas. He received a large portion of both for $15. Guess I should have gotten them because I paid $20 for 5, yes 5, shrimp in my fajitas. The chips and queso were very good, though. The takeaway from here is don't get the shrimp fajitas unless you want to feel cheated. I'm guessing there's a better Mexican restaurant value somewhere nearby?
