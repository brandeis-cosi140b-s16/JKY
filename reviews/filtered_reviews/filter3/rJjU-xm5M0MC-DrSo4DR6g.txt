I've never been to Pepe's Tacos but have heard good things about it. This location is the one closest to my house. On one hungry evening, I was craving tacos. And so to Pepe's Tacos we went!

You can find Pepe's Tacos located in the same plaza as La Bonita and Lee's Liquor on Rainbow. This building is pretty big and is and very clean. 

We ordered tacos: asada, carnitas, al pastor, and a chicken quesadilla. Along with that I ordered the fresh mixed juice (carrots and orange).

The asada meat was a little on the dry side, yet somewhat greasy... does that even make sense? The carnitas and al pastor were decent. At least they weren't dry, but I was hungry so I downed it. The chicken quesadilla wasn't enjoyable at all... ended up boxing it up with a few bites. The only thing I really enjoyed was the mixed juice. It came room temperature... probably would've liked it ice, but it was good.

I probably wouldn't come here again unless I've exhausted all my options. This is a 24/7 place, so I guess that's the only real benefit it has.
