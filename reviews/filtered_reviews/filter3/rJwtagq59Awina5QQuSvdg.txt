Pink Taco is one of my favorites because the menus are pink and sparkly and the waitresses never mind when I come in with my hot pink Pink Taco shot glass, and of course being loud and obnoxious doing tequila shots is just so much fun. The food is pretty good for out of California Mexican food....I like the chicken tostada salad, it would be better if it was steak...but, we can't have everything we want...
They freshly make their tortillas, which I guess is pretty standard now, but still a plus in my mind. 
The one really unique thing is the tequila pina colada....it was pretty good, and if you are doing tequila shots, being able to order a frozen drinks without mixing rum and tequila is amazing.
