Came here immediately after our flight landed. Was here with a few friends on a recruiting trip and they had gone to school at CMU previously. 

We attempted to eat and drink our way to our per diem -- to no avail!!

The 1/2 price menu had our bill for 4 people at 50$. Including massive margaritas, appetizers, and enough food to take home (which of course we didn't, who wants left-over mad mex?!?!).

The scene was pretty horrible tho. very very crowded, and a ton of drunk college kids. Yah, I know, I'm in a college town. Just reminds me of why I moved away from mine, :).
