The place was PACKED on an early Saturday evening with a very interesting crowd of young and old and in-between, hip and not so hip, families and couples and singles.  We headed straight for the patio, but it was PACKED, too.  We turned up our noses at the odd room in the middle that is dark and dominated by a large screen and EMPTY.  Luckily, we scored the last two stools at the bar!

We overheard our bartender describing  the making of the housemade bloody Mary mix  to a woman next to us and you know me and bloody Marys!  Naturally, I had to have one.  The b-tender described the mix as more of a gazpacho with lots of cilantro that was made in huge batches and stirred with a paddle.  Good choice there...nice and spicy, kick of cilantro and a heavy hand on the Ketel One.  Nice beginning.  

Not wanting to feel the effects too soon, we ordered the pork belly tacos from the bar menu.  Yet another great choice.  I do love me some pork belly and this one was nicely set off with a kick of heat, smoothed out with a little pineapple and a nice little veggie crunch to boot.  Just a little bit of porky heaven there.

There are some negatives, though.  Yes, it is called a cantina which to me brings visions of a dingy, dirty south-of-the border establishment.  And that's exactly what we found.  Flies and fruit flies abounded.  The mirror above the bar was encrusted with who-knows-what....shudder.  The bar desperately needed to be wiped down.  The other negative was the prices!  

I'll close out with another positive.  The bartenders were efficient, friendly and very skilled.  Worth another try just for the drinks and the pork belly!
