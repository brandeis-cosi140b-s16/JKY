This was my second visit to this place and we all were in agreement the bean dip and chips were the bomb! Actually most of our meal was good! The only bad or down side is how can you only get two small meatballs in a albondigas soup? Come on man!! Really!?!?? Otherwise the lunch was fine!

Now, this does not mean I will not be going back..for lunch. :-)
