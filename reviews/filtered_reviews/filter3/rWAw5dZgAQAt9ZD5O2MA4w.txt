This placed was crowded on a Friday night mostly with young families. They give you a little dish so you can pile on fresh chips with three different salsas by the counter- unlimited! So it's nice.

I ordered the Chile Relleno- a thin, roasted green chile stuffed with cheese, served with rice and beans. I thought the chile would be more stuffed with meat or quinoa or something but it was really thin with cheese, and the rice and beans were nothing too  spectacular. My friend's quesadilla was just OK too.
