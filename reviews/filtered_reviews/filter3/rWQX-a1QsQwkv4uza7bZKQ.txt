Good hole-in-the-wall style decent Mexican food. It's very small and cozy, just two rows of counter seating facing away from each other with a little aisle in between, but they bring your food to you. I think there is some outdoor seating too. There's a really small parking lot and street parking nearby. I had a big burrito that was only $5, but it was almost entirely lettuce. There was hardly any meat in it and it didn't taste like much. But like I said, $5. My friend had a quesadilla which was good. The chips and salsa and guac are really good, and the staff is really nice!
