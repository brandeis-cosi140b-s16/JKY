I chose to only give Last Velas three stars because of lackluster service. It's something that seemed to have been missing recently when I stopped in for lunch with my parents on a Saturday afternoon. The food is good, not amazing, just good. Location is great...being in the heart of Pittsurgh's historical Market Square. Check it out.
