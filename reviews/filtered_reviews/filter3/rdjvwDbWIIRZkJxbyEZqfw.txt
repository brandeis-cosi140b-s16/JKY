Let me start by saying that this is a preliminary review....I have a groupon for dinner here, so I will definitely be trying it again and will update then.

Ok, so yesterday the BF and I went here for breakfast to celebrate my graduation and because I wanted to try it (what can I say, I buy into the Food Network hype). I made a reservation, which was completely unnecessary because the restaurant was empty (not to mention huuuge). I ordered the steak and eggs and the BF had the pancakes with the tequila raisins and whatnot. The portion sizes were small and the prices were high. My steak was alright, but had a burnt kind of flavor and not a lot of seasoning.... one of my eggs was overcooked (asked for over medium, one was over hard). I wish they put some kind of sauce or chimichurri or something on the steak to give it a little more flavor. The beans that came with it were alright, but had some bacon or something in it that was limp and chewy...not awesome. The BF's pancakes were really tasty....the problem was that they cost 12$ and were about the size of 1.5 small pancakes at most restaurants....not a lot of food. Their coffee was good, which it should be at 4$ a cup and we were able to have a few refills of it. I think the prices are inflated due to the Food Network connection and location. The service was alright, although a bit lacking considering the place was completely empty. I am still looking forward to using my groupon because it's hard to tell how the food will be based on breakfast, but I would not come here for breakfast again....For the same price go to Province or go to Morning Glory for breakfast....


PS the decor of this restaurant is awesome and I want a sparkly pink table for my future house :-P
