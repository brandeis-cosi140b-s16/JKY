I got the vegetarian burrito and thought it was just average tasting.

They do not post the nutritional facts of their food, which scares me a bit.  I have done some digging in the past when places like this didn't post anything, and the results were scary (ie, tons of Trans fats).

The burrito size to price ratio was above average also.

I doubt I will make the journey back.
