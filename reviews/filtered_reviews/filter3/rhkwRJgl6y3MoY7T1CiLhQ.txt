Me and a few coworkers decided to check the place out since it landed in the Phoenix magazine. We got there at 11:30am, which apparently is a good time because when we were getting ready to leave the line was out the door and there were no open seats. The parking lot is super tight. Seating in cramped, but you know what, I didn't mind. Menu is little, makes it easy to order!!

I got two tacos (carne asada) and corn. The tacos were great, but not out this world. The corn, however, was delicious and because it was I will be back! My coworkers got the torta and burrito and we all share nachos and salsa. The torta got rave reviews and I will be getting that next time.  The horchata, per my coworker, was the best she's ever had. Overall a good experiance.
