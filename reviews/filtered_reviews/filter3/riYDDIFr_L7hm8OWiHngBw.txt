Pretty decent place with a wide variety of food.  We had the nachos and I was pretty disappointed with them.  It's just beans with sprinkled cheese on tortilla rounds. The enchiladas however,  were super awesome and delicious.  On point.  Other than that I'd say just nibble on the free chps and salsa because the salsa tastes ketchup based,  but it is hot!  Also,  I enjoy the pricing because you get what you pay for in quantity and it's pretty cheap!
