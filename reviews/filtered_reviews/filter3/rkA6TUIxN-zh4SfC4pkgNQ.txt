Let me start out by saying my friends and I LOVE tequila, mainly Patron. We aren't the girls shooting Jose...no thank you! So we made it out to the soft opening of Canteen and we were sold. Great server, good food and of course TEQUILA! 

Last weekend after the ASU football game we stopped into Canteen because we were in a tequila tasting sort of mood. It was fairly busy so we put our name in for a table and went to the bar. We asked our studded belt wearing bartender if there were flights of tequila. When he said no I responded "Tequila Bar FAIL" with a smile on face. It wasn't a deal breaker it just would be nice for a TEQUILA BAR to offer tastings of tequila in flights! His response however was "I encourage you to try our competition then". WOW, rude! After another rude comment from d-bag bartender we were sat at our table. All was going well, we ordered margaritas, a round of shots and some food. Our tequila shots were delivered to the table after about 10 minutes and no lime or salt. We like training wheels, so sue us! After waiting another 10 minutes for our server who did NOT show up we just took the shot and chased it with our margaritas. Oh well, no biggie. So we finish our food and margaritas and we're sitting there empty waiting for our server. When he finally arrives we're over waiting and want to leave so we get the bill. One our bill is an extra house margarita as well as a Classic Margarita that we did not order and did not receive. As it would have taken another 20 minutes to get this fixed we paid and left.

I love the atmosphere and the concept of this place but the service is genuinely lacking! You might want to take the bartender's advice and try the competition if you're looking for someone to be polite to you as they hold their hand out for a tip. Try Cien Agaves, The Mission, Juan Jaimes, anywhere else with tequila at least until they work out this rather large kink!
