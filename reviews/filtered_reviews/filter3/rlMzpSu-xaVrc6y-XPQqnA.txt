It's a beautiful restaurant. The decor is grade A, classy and dim and sexy. I only went here for lunch, but I'd imagine it's a great date place, especially if your date is shallow like me and gets excited about visually impressive places. You enter and behind the host's table is a whole wall lined with tequila bottles. Really gorgeous.

I can't remember what my husband ordered. I remember we got the mexican corn as an appetizer, and I got a lovely cocktail that had raspberries and champagne in it. Quite delicious. The corn was so so. Better mexican corn can be found at the Black Chile Grill in the Biltmore. It wasn't charred enough, and I think the amazing creaminess from slathered mayo wasn't there. Probably was healthier for you though! My fish tacos were good, but not outstanding. 

In short, a good restaurant, but nothing memorable. Don't go out of your way to enjoy the food there, but don't avoid it either. If you're there shopping, make sure to give it a shot!
