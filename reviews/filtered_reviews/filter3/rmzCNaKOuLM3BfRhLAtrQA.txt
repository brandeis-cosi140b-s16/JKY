I've been here a couple of times, though it's been awhile.  The reason it's been awhile is because nothing I've ordered here has wowed me.

Both times I've been here, I've come with a group during happy hour.  I don't recall what I ordered the first time, but the second time, I ordered the fish tacos.  They were disappointing--the fish didn't seem very fresh, and its flavor was drowned out by the salsa.  The refried beans and rice that came with it were pretty nondescript, as well.  I don't recall much about the chips, so they must not have struck me as particularly tasty.

The margaritas, on the other hand, were pretty good.  I personally don't have the alcohol tolerance for the Big Azz margarita, so I went with the smaller ones both times.  I believe I ordered the strawberry once and the mango once, and they were both decent.

Be forewarned that it's extremely crowded during happy hour, and that the noise level is extremely loud.  If I came here again, I'd skip the food and would try to sit at the bar and order chips and a margarita.  If I came around Thanksgiving, I might try the gobblerito, however, since this seems to be a popular option.
