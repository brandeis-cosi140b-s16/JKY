Majority of the seating is outdoors, and the night felt pretty nice. I can't imagine what it will be like in 100+ degree weather! LOL. We had a giant party and the staff was exceptional. They had us covered all night.

I ordered the Carne de Fuego which was steak in this spicy and sweet sauce with some sweet potatos stuffed into a pepper. The overall meal was good. I wouldn't say it's the best steak or Mexican food I have eaten. It was ok. 

It's not a bad place to eat. There's definitely better Mexican food and cheaper Mexican food. But for something different, this might be the place.
