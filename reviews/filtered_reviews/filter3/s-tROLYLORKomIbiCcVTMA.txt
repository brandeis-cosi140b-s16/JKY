So. You are trapped inside security and need a meal. I give this place three stars for trying. Their prices are high, even for airport food ($26 for enchiladas with sides?). I have dined here only twice, but would recommend sticking to the smaller and less expensive menu items. My enchiladas seemed to have had the cheese slide out if them, and the number of shrimp was shrimpy. I had tried the pork tacos before, and they were very good. The spicy mashed potatoes were also tasty. They do have outlets at their bench seating so you can charge your devices.
