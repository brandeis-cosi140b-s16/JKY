I heard such high regard for this place that I was thrilled to attend a birthday dinner last night. The atmosphere is lively and entertaining with Spanish dancers and musicians. This is why I'm giving 3 stars.  Our margaritas were sub par and obviously cheap tequila because of my headache this morning!  Ceviche was good but the chips served were hard and tasteless. My enchiladas had a tasty verde sauce but they were barely warm. Rice was tasteless too. I think this place is more about urban chic hype than good food. If you go stick to tap beer for happy hour and get dinner somewhere else!
