The food is really really good, and cheap. The only problem is now they have more business then they can handle. I've been twice one for lunch for work I had to take a 2 hour lunch because I waited an hour for my food, and we all got our food at different times. Second I brought my girl up there cause the food was so good and we had to wait 40 min just to get the food and the order was wrong and she didn't want to wait for it to be corrected. Very frustrating but both times what I ate was so so good.
