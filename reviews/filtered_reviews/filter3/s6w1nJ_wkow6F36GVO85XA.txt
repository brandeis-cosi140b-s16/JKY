Positives: 
-serves beer in chilled glasses
-awesome TVs & bar to watch sports
-chips & salsa
-clean, divey ambiance
-above average service

Negatives:
-very inauthentic Mexican food, i.e. store bought taco shells
-despite the great salsa, no good hot sauce
-food delivered in skin melting heated plates 

Overall a good neighborhood sports bar that happens to serve so-so Mexican food. La Pinata is still the gold standard in Phoenix Mexican food.
