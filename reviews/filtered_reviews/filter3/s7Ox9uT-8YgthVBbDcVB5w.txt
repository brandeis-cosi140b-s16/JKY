Came here for lunch on a Friday. The place was packed, but we got a table pretty quickly. The ambiance and place itself is amazing, as you can see by the pictures and other descriptions. I couldn't stop looking around at all the cool features. LOVE the stained glass windows and giant candle chandelier that hangs over the center of the room.
We ordered our food, and about 30 minutes passed. Then the waitress came by to tell us that the kitchen was slammed and our food would be a bit longer. Another 10-15 minutes later, our food came out, but not all at once. 
The food itself was very good. We couldn't stop eating the freshly made chips and salsa that they brought out. I got the pork and beef tacos with a side of corn, and my boyfriend got the chicken burrito. Everything tasted fresh and authentic. The tacos are really small, and I could have eaten at least 1 more.
The waitress came over after our meal to let us know that our meal was totally on the house because of the long, ridiculous wait. She sat down with us for a minute to explain that they had just opened up (we were aware of that) and really weren't prepared for such a busy lunch hour. I really appreciated her taking the time to apologize and explain things. I told her that we understood and would definitely be back to try them again.
Overall: Cool place, great tasting Mexican food, but they are still working out some kinks with the service/kitchen so don't expect a quick lunch experience.
