I've been wanting to try this place for awhile after hearing good things about it and reading the menu. I realize now why the website doesn't list prices-- the mission is hideously overpriced!

We ended up on the patio since they weren't seating in the main area yet (at 6:30pm? For reals?) Our waitress was nice and attentive. She noticed my water had something floating in it and replaced it quickly. My husband's water glass was dirty too. She brought us out two sample size frozen peach and strawberry margaritas which were awesome. Much better than the rocks margarita.

No complimentary chips and salsa which would be ok if they offered something else like Barrio. No happy hour either which was disappointing.

The street corn was good, but I've had much better. The butternut squash tacos were out of this world. My husband liked them better than his mahi tacos. I just can't believe they have the gall to charge $12 for 3 tiny (3 inches in diameter) tacos. They also charge $12 for guac made from 2 avocados. I'm not sure how they have survived in this economy. They must be very slow when the tourists leave for the summer.
