We enjoyed this Mexican Restaurant.  The food and the service was good.  We ordered a Mexican Shrimp DIsh, Glazed Chicken and Carne Asada Tacos and all was very good.  Live music played while we ate dinner which was very nice.  We all left very full and satisfied.  The price was right and I would suggest trying this restaurant some time.
