I hear that Padre's is closing tomorrow.  I went a few months agao and didn't review it yet so here goes :o)  The  Mojito I got was okay but I've had better.  The guac and chips were ordinary.  Service was excellent and I didn't have enough food to really review it but with all the other similar restaurants around it doesn't shock me that they don't get enough business.  It's just not that memorable or different.  Sorry!
