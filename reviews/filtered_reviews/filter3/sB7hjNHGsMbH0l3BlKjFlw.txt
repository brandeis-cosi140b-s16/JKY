Decently priced, great margaritas, and a fun (although bro-y) atmosphere. If you choose to seat yourself outside, be warned-- you will be waiting 10-15 minutes until someone gets around to checking in with you. It's probably no fault of the servers, both times I've been, they were super busy. Ask for as much as you can in one breath; water, napkins, and silverware, otherwise you may be without utensils when your food is served.

The guacamole is ok... but it's a huge serving (3 of us split it and still had some left over) and goes well with anything you order. They also bring you two salsas, both of which are really good. It also comes with a bucket of great chips and they give free refills which I encourage you to avoid, otherwise your food will come and you'll be stuffed!
