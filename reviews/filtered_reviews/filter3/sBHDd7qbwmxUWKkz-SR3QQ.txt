I had the pastrami on a pretzel roll which I felt overpowered the meat and cabbage. I got that adage, "where's the beef" I am saying there has to be more meat or less bun. Wife had a Mexican dish and was very happy with it. Someone/ owner needs to pay more attention to detail as the feel of the place get lost without more attention. One top of a wall was a planter box with a consumer label still stuck to it. We got bit by mosquitos outside on the patio thinking not the water in the ponds but the pooling of lawn water outside the entrance. Don't know if the front is policed by staff b4 opening 4 day but drinks were left on ledge of entrance wall at noon. 
The french fries and  were very good. We don't go out that much and wanted a sort of special treat and we were overall pleased. Say thanks for the mild May temps. for that.
