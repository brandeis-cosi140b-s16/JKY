I'm giving three stars because the nachos are overpriced. 20 bucks is too much. Now we should have listened to our server when she said it feed 4. It really feeds 4! We should have ordered one not two. 

Drinks were good. Mine needed a little more Stoli. 

It's less crowded at lunch than after 7 when folks are looking drink and party!

Cool spot overall.
