1 Veggie taco (not very filling) -3.5/5 ( very fresh beans, that was good)
1 Chicken quesadilla( very filling)-3/5 because it was too oily
2 Mango juice-3/5
1 Chips and Salsa-4/5

Ambience- very casual, as you would expect from a fast food joint.

Wait time- very less

Total with tax- $14.32 for two people.
