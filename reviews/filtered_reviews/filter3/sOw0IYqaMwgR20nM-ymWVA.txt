The carne asada--incredibly plentiful and packed in that burrito--was so dry and tasteless that I am sure it was yesterday's meat.  I ate it, but I was so disappointed in Los Compadres for this.
I ordered a carne asada burrito only, but the nice girl at the register gave me free rice and refried beans...maybe to make up for the horrid meat?
The orders are big, the guacamole was just excellent, and the salsa is pretty standard and good, but that meat I won't get over soon.
Will I try this place again?  Not sure if I would or not at this point.  I guess it depends on if I am starving and super near them.
Now, if Los Compadres fixes the meat problem I can overlook their barely passing a Health Code violation old dirt in the corners of the place.  Very disappointed customer here...very...cause I'm a tacqueria fan of these little funky dirty places, ate at tons of them and always get the best food.  But not here this day....damn!
