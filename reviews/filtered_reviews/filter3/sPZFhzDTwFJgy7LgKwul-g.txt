Good food but not worth the wait nor cold food. Been here once and I was not impressed w/ how inefficient the staff operated. The take out is served in a Aluminum container w/ wrapping paper and strings as a lid. Took about 30 minutes to get through the short line and by the time I got home my food was cold. Food was def over priced.
