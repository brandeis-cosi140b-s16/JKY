This is an ok place to have taco's. I ordered 12 steak and 12 chicken Taco's. I read a lot of the reviews before going and with all the 5 stars I thought I would give it a try. Unfortunately for me the steak and chicken were over cooked and dry. I had the corn tortillas and they were wonderful.  Not much in the flavor department when it came to the meat. I will say that the jalapeno sauce was very good and spicy. But having only one very good sauce will not cause me to go out of my way to eat here.
