Atmosphere and friendliness of shop and owner save this review from a 1 star rating.
I ordered two burritos both either had too little food or the tortillas was way too big. I literally tore off between the two enough tortillas to make 2 big tacos. The potatoes inside the burritos were way over cooked, I would say burnt. I might try this place again but only because the owner was nice. The guacamole also had too much garlic and salt l, a little less and I wouldn't of even mentioned it. 
For food I would recommend Don Tortaco if you want a breakfast burrito. 
The hot salsa was delicious though and the chorizo was also perfect minus the tortillas and potato issues.
