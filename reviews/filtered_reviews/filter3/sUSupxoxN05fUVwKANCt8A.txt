I visited the Rokerij a few months back and it was pretty good. The hype of the place didn't really live up to expectations, but maybe it was just because we were in a back room.. 

We had a private back room. The server forgot to put in a couple orders, one of the girls ended up getting her food after all of us were done. We did have some great mimosas, and our plate was good. I might try this again someday. Maybe on a date or something. The lights were really low and romantic. I personally like it a little brighter so we can see the people around us, but I get the purpose of the dim effect. This place would be nice if you're looking for a fancy dinner with a date.
