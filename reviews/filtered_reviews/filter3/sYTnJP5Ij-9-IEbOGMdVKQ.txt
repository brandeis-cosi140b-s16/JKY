Better than I thought it would be.  The decor is underwhelming.   It was good food well made.  Not greasy like a lot of other places.  I noticed another review talking about bad service, It was fine when we were there, but it wasn't overly busy.  It is telling that we live close and have not been there often.  Not sure what they need to do to take this restaurant to the next level.
