TeePee is okay. It seems like everything on the menu comes out the same. A ton of food (whatever it is you ordered..) with a ton of sauce poured on top, with a ton of rice and beans on the side.  Last time my boyfriend and I went, I ordered the Chicken Fajita Chimi. When it came out, I got instant heartburn just looking at this plate of food I was expected to eat (although that also might have been the result of the white wine and margaritas I had during happy hour). Either way, it was daunting.

I could only finish about 4 bites of my burrito at the restaurant. The good news is, TeePee is one of those places where the leftovers are even better then the original. You heat up everything at the same time, it all turns into a warm, gooey, saucy, cheesy mess and you eat bite after bite indiscriminately on your couch watching reality TV marathons.  It's really best with reality TV marathons.
