Ok, for an airport.  The Arizona burrito was pretty bland, but not bad.  I think there were four beers on tap, so you're lucky to get one good craft beer.  Food and beer is at an average price, which is always a shock in an airport.  My server was awesome though.  

Bottom Line:  In a pinch, it's ok and won't break the wallet.
