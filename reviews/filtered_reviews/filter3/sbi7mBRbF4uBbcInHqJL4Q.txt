I love the food here, but that is the only reason I keep coming back. It's definitely not for the customer service. 

I went on a Sunday with my mom and sister and they are supposed to open at 11. Another customer walked in through the side door right at 11 as they hadn't opened the front door yet, so we followed. The girl behind the counter told us "We'll be with you in a couple minutes, we're not open yet." Really? Because the sign says 11 and it's 11. I've worked in retail before and if we had customers standing outside the building, we opened early, if not, right on time. You don't keep paying customers waiting, it's just bad business. You should be ready to open right when you are supposed to.

 Then I asked if they had any more Cholula because there was none on the shelf and the cashier just immediately answered no without even looking. So I asked for Tapatia. Again, immediate no. So I pointed to the bottle of Tapatia that I saw sitting behind the counter. "Oh, that must be the last one!" Oh thanks for going through so much trouble to do your job.

Oh and don't even bother attempting to order an extra taco. I tried ordering an extra shrimp taco once because the order comes with two and I swear it's like I asked then to perform the unspeakable. I told then I would pay the price for the single taco (You can order two or just one so obviously combine the price. I know it's expensive. I just want three tacos!) And the kid taking my order still had to consult with two other people before they would make me three. 

I love the steak and shrimp tacos and I crave the creamy cilantro dressing. If the customer service was better, I would have given a better rating.
