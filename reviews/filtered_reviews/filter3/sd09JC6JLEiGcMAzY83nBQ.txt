Four of us went to Secreto for Happy Hour.  When you walk in the door, the smell is fabulous.  We  tried wine, beer and a martini along with a couple of appetizers.  The food and drinks were good, but a little pricey for happy hour. Unfortunately, the bar looks into the kitchen and there is bar seating only, so it was difficult for four people to sit and talk.  Since the door faces west, we were blinded each time the door opened, too.  For happy hour atmosphere comfortable for conversing with friends, I would recommend going elsewhere.
