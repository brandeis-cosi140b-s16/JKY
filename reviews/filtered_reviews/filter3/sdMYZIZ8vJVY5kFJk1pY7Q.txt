I have been fortunate enough to work with Susan and Mary Sue through their partnership with the California Avocado Commission and have tasted their food from the LA restaurants and food trucks alike. Everything has been as wonderful as the chefs themselves. This LV location is not representative of that tradition. At least not on the night I brought my family here. 
We sat and had our drink orders taken. The Arnold palmers were sweeter than dessert should be. Traded them out for iced teas instead. Chips and salsa were mentioned but didn't make it to the table until after the appetizer hit us. Bit of a fail in the service. 
The appetizer was the queso fundido. Great. Except that an appetizer meant to be shared by the table of 4 came with 1 flour tortilla! Really? If you're going to give us 1 tortilla to share then cut it up into wedges at least, so we don't all have to try to be polite about our tiny portion of 1 tortilla to share! Should have been at least 2-3 instead of 1. An extra one cost a buck so why not add the buck to the original cost if $1 is the issue?
The main course was a little bit of a lot of stuff. The Guatemalan ceviche was perfect. Bravo ceviche bar! The carnitas were run of the mill. No seasoning, nothing memorable at all aside from the presentation. Yucca fries in chimichurri with garlic aioli were also basic AF. We skipped dessert because we did not want to be disappointed one more time. 
The personality and creativity this team of chefs has was so underrepresented in this meal that I just gave up on the night. Went back to the room and got some zzzs to put the day away. I thought going to the two hot tamales in Vegas was a sure bet but the gamble did not pay off.
Oh yeah. And something made me sick. It's 10am and I can't imaging eating still.
