I've been coming here for years and I thought it was a very good Mexican restaurant. My in-laws like it. My husband does not- he doesn't think that it's anything special. 

What really turned us off was the fact that the guacamole we asked for was $6.00!!! The server should have said something to us. What's funny is that as an LVAC member, you get a discount when you show the server your card. That was the discount right there. How funny.

Birthday celebrants get the silly treatment- a shot with whipped cream while wearing a sombrero and getting serenaded by the mariachi band.

So, no, we won't be going back. We usually have a hard time finding good Mexican restaurants. Don't get me wrong, there are a lot here, but finding a good one, is a challenge. Lots of fans for this place, I know.
