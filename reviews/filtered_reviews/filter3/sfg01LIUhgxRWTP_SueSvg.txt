This is a great find if you are looking for value. With all the overpriced places in Vegas, it's nice to find one that still has a good deal. The quality of the product is not the best, but for $2 how can you complain? We make sure to stop in here on all our trips to Vegas. It is in the very back of Bally and worth the trek to get there. The margaritas are not the best, but they are cold, cheap and get the job done. Tacos are also nothing special, but they are fresh and tasty. We usually come in the afternoon and have a few drinks and a little snack to hold us until dinner. Great place if you are looking to get drunk, full or both for cheap.
