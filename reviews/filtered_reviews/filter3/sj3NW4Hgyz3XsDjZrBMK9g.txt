Went to HH last night  Two couples  had two amazing appetizers and good salsa - ok chips.  The appetizers were the papas and the beef chile verde so yummy  had casa margaritas which were sparse  5 happy hour price is good but these were 4 sips and gone. Sweet waitress. Great atmosphere. Have been to other location and is nice to have one in Gilbert  HH was good but skip the margaritas unless you just want a sip. Nothing special about them for sure
