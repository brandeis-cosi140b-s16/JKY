Papi Chulo's is a adjunct to the Days Inn on Scottsdale Rd  We set up a birthday party for 14 here in the Santana Room during happy hour. The management was helpful in getting this done. 
The Cantina was clean. It had a beautiful wooden bar, looking well-stocked. I liked the wooden tables and chairs done in a solid Mexican style... inviting.
I arrived a bit late with the party in full gear. 
The table had all it's setups in place. Some people already had their food in front of them. The street tacos looked tempting. I was told the meat was tasty and the small tortillas were fresh. I had the taquitos. They weren't very crispy and were almost less than American mild. I had a sip of someone's frozen margarita. The flavor was bright and the drink refreshing. There are times I wish I weren't the designated driver and this was one of them!
The good news... our waiter was good at getting my drink and taquitos right away He was pleasant. The bad news... it took 20 minutes to get a glass of ice.
Overall, I would give it a second chance - and let someone else be the designated driver.
