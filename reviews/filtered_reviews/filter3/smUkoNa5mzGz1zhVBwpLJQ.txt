Stopped in here on a Friday night and was surprised to see that it wasn't that busy.  Our party of 4 was seated right away.

We started with some beers, chips and salsa, and some queso and chorizo dip.  All were good but pretty standard for a tex-mex restaurant.

I got two tacos (Carnitas and Chorizo) and the street corn that people have raved about.
Carnitas - I enjoyed the fruit elements (pineapple and mango).  They paired well with the pulled pork.  The crispy onions were an interesting topping.  While I enjoyed them, I'm not sure what they added to the taco.
Chorizo - Nothing not to like here.  This felt very traditional and was delicious.
Street Corn - Honestly, I didn't love it.  Cheese and sour cream on corn.  I was wanting the crema to have more flavor.  Garlic, salt, some chili perhaps.  Naturally, I ate it all so it wasn't terrible.

Our server took really good care of us and was patient as we took forever to look over the menu.  The restaurant has a funky vibe inside and is basically split with the bar on one side, the kitchen in the middle, and restaurant seating on the other side.
