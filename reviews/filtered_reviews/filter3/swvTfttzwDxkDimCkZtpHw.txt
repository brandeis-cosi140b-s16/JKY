Flavorless salsa, but maybe it is the head cold.  I had a bowl of Albongas soup which was actually pretty good.  Still prefer a bowl accompanied by flour tortillas, chopped onion and cilantro.  The taquitos were comparable to anything I could get in frozen section of grocery aisle.  The guacamole that topped taquitos was poor.  All in all not a great meal.  Service and decor were great though.
