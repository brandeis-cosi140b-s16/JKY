Second time here. Last night for my birthday. Food is very well prepared and tasty. From the Queso Fundido to the street corn to their burgers and even Shrimp and Grits, everyone was really satisfied. Problem was the front of the house. Waitstaff seemed overwhelmed and confused (which didn't seem necessary since it is a small restaurant). Waitress was very pleasant but not proactive. Until you asked for something like chips or salsa or utensils she was not the one to think of it. And the one thing that made the whole night less than desirable was the air conditioning was not working up to par since (per they're explanation that there will be a new A/C installed in the enclosed patio area but since hasn't been installed, the main room unit was working overload and that's why it wasn't cooling down. It was really uncomfortable. To say I would rush back again considering the service, I would say not a chance. However, their food makes up a big portion of the experience and it is very good.
