I have to be real and blunt I absolutely love this place but there are some big con's that forced me to dock some stars.

Atmosphere:5/5 It doesn't get more authentic than this. When you walk into this restaurant you feel like your in Mexico. It looks like an old Mexican tavern. Dim lighting with a guy in the corner with a guitar jamming away. Honestly the vibes of this place was awesome! The bar was more than fully stocked. With your "American vodka's" and a WIDE WIDE selection of Tequila's. 

Service: 3/5 The service felt very homey, like I had a Mexican mother cooking me home made Mexican food. The food was very wholesome in HUGE portions. I literally had no Idea where to begin. So I started in the middle and ate my way out. LOL Service at the bar could've been a bit better. I went during peak dinner hours so I guess that's why they neglected us. I noticed my group didn't get any bar tables stands for our plates like other groups so we ate directly on the bar.  Also our complimentary salsa, chips, and pinto bean dip ran low. I wasn't sure If I could as for more because it was complimentary "well so I thought it was" 

Food: 4/5 First the salsa, chips, and pinto bean dip. OMG was super delicious. The salsa was average but the bean dip was very tasty. but don't fill up on the chips. Next comes the pre dinner soup, not sure what it was but it was very bland. It looked spicy but it wasn't. Now the meal, it was very heavy, when I say heavy. I mean fatty, cheesy, and oily. I literally had to push around the cheese to get to anything. It was EVERYWHERE kind of an over load. The cheese enchilada lacked flavor, and on my 3 combo plate (1 tostada, 1 beef taco, 1 enchilada). The beef on the taco was shredded like pulled pork. It seemed more like a carnita. The tostada was very fresh because it was topped off with a big glob of guacamole. YUMMMM 

Drinks: 4/5 The drinks were just right. Not too strong, not too weak. A perfect blend. I ordered a margarita because I felt.. I needed to indulge fully into Mexican culture. It was a perfect combo to my meal. 

Pricing: 3/5 My order was $13.95 a bit pricy for the Area of town it's in. But It was understandable because the food was good. The atmosphere complimented the food well. Plus it came with complimentary salsa and chips, with also this intro dinner soup.

Suggestions/Advice: 
- Don't go during peak dinner hours if you want impeccable service.
- Don't fill up on a lot of chips,salsa, and pinto bean dip.
- Portions are huge 
- TRY THE PINTO BEAN DIP it was heaven!!!
- Parking might be difficult its a very small limited area.
