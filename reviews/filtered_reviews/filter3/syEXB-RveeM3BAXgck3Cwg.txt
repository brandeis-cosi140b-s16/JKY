We ordered a few items on the tapas menu. Food is okay although some of the items reminded me of Julian Serrano's menu. The execution was decent but the food didn't taste very good. One thing though: I noticed the other reviews mentioned how small the portions were; yet all of the items we ordered came in huge portions! 

You're probably better off going elsewhere for tapas.
