A friend of mine raves about this place and I finally got the chance to check it out for a weekday lunch. I almost missed it off 40th street, signage is hardly noticeable unless you are up close to the restaurant. I walked inside and the restaurant is small and casual. Staff is very friendly and I even got to say hello to the owner. I went through the menu and decided on the Texas BBQ burger with sweet potato tots. Order comes out pretty quickly but I notice the portions are pretty small. The burger itself was tasty- I liked that it was different but very messy to eat. The sweet potato tots were also good but the ranch for some reason was very off to me. It wasn't the white, creamy stuff I'm used to, rather almost a yellowish color and very thick. I didn't like that. Overall, I liked P.V. Burger Company and would go again.
