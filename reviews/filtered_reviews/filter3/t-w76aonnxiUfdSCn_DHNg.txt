We had our Christmas exchange luncheon there.  We had 6 of us.  FUN!  It was easy to find.  We were sat in a big table in the corner.  The corner booths were hard to get in.  It took me 3 mins to scoot my butt into the corner seat.  They had fabric cushions on the booth, so scooting was a little harder, then the pillows for the back.  =)  I rather into all of them.  LOL!  

The environment was a little darker inside, soft music in the background, and the services was good.  

The menu was our placemat.  I ordered the beef and cheese sandwich.  It was ok.  I was not blown away.  I guess I should have ordered something like the tacos or burrito?
