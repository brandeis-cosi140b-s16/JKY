The food is just eh, so not authentic but still halfway decent greasy yummies....especially for Happy Hour prices! 2 for 1 drinks and 50% appetizers is hard to beat! Great music and fun people. Definitely a good place to start the night off! I'm excited for the Century City one to open!

This isn't a place to come for food, it's just a fun place to party with your friends. I'm all about Happy Hours and this one is great!
