Well, it's not bad by any means, but the food didn't really have a hook to it.

I got the fried fish, 50/50, and carne asada tacos.  The fish was nice and hot but the overall taste didn't really jump out at me.  The 50/50 had good chorizo, same problem with the taste not being really special.  The asada is good, but....you get the picture.  When I try a new taco place I want to have that moment where you really find something you like in your first bite, something that stands out.

Everything else is done the way I like it.  Salsa bar with regular and spicy (not much flavor, tho) and an avocado cream sauce that is excellent.  You can ask for habenero sauce which they keep in the fridge.  Really easy to find, easy parking, fast prep, really friendly staff, free soda refills.

One of these days I'll probably head back in again and give it another shot.
