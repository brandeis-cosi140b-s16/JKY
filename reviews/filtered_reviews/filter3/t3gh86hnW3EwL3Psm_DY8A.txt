This place is fun. It was my first time going to a Senor Frog's and I had a fun time with the sing along and the free shots. However, I am very happy I did not end up paying for a drink and reading these reviews have validated my choice in not doing so. I got a buy one, get two voucher but the yards you get are some of the most expensive I saw in Vegas. About $28 for one (what gives)?! And they had a policy on the bar that said if you were caught giving your two for one yard to someone else, you'd end up paying the full price. That is messed up to me. The drink choices were also extremely unappealing. However, the environment is fun. I love the free balloons we got and I'd go back just for the atmosphere.
