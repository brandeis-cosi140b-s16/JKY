I really wanted to love this place - I was super excited for Mexican food, and I loved the decor and the vibe when we came in, but I don't think I picked the right food, and the service was unfortunately not as good as I'd hoped. 

We were a large group, but the restaurant wasn't very busy so it seemed like it would be fine. We had pre-ordered appies and the brussel sprout nachos were seriously to. die. for. They were outstanding! 5 stars for those, that's for sure! The sprouts were cooked perfectly and the cheese and sauce on the nachos complimented them so well - the fried egg was an added creamy bonus! The guacamole was also delicious, very fresh!

For my main I should have got tacos but decided to be healthy and get a salad. I asked the server which salad was best (I was indecisive and trying to be quick) and she suggested the Caesar. Usually I'm not a Caesar fan, but this had purple kale, corn, and avocado (YUM) so I thought I'd give it a shot. She asked if I wanted to add meat and I took her suggestion of the BBQ chicken. 

When my food arrived I was disappointed to see it was mostly romaine with very small pieces of purple kale. The 'croutons' were tortilla chips, which was unique but I wish they had stated that on the menu. The chicken was my least favourite part as I found it quite flavourless, unfortunately. The salad was ok but not something I'd order again.

The rest of our table's food trickled in slowly with a couple of small errors to our orders. One of our party asked three times for tortillas, and by the time they finally arrived he took three bites of his food and had to leave. 

I would come back with a much smaller group and try some of their other food - the nachos alone would make me come back! I just wouldn't have the salad again...
