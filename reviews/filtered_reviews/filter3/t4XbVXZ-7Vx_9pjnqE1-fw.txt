The restaurant is small, probably room for about 50.  I went Saturday at lunch and it was busy, and there was a steady flow of customers.  The problem was there was only one waitress.  She was efficient, but obviously the service wasn't as good as it should be.  The family had carnitas, minichangas, and a chimichanga.  All were very tasty, and the price was very fair.  Because there was only one server, the later guests had to clean their own tables.  I also used the bathroom after eating, and it was about as clean as a gas station bathroom.  Must be something close to authentic as we were the only gringos in the place.  I'd give the food five stars, but service and cleanliness need to be improved.
