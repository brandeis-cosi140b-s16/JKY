Their best dish: chicken Nachos. Just go to cafe Rio or Costa Vida, unless you just want to chill on Mill Ave and are craving some Mexican food. Burrito was a bit of a let down. Seemed they slumped out on what they could, and I wasn't loving that it just came in a plastic basket. Haha. Best part was leaving one of our random cards under their table to add to the collection.
