Nice concept to differentiate from all the Mexican Food out there.

we shared a steak quesadilla ($9) and a taco salad ($11).

Quesadilla ok, but too much butter on it.  Taco salad was just average .  . . .the salsa they provide is what makes the salad flavorful.  Not much chicken on salad

Had 2 of their speciality margs.  The rasberry one was incredibly good and the mango was was just ok.  A bit pricey at $9 each, but we had a bygo free coupon.

The service was good and our server was great.  We had a 10 month old with us and they made sure she was ok.

Overall . . . .just an ok.  Would probably go there for drinks again, but not sure I would do dinner.
