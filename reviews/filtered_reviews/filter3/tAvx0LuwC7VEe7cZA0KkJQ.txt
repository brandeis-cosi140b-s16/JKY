I understand that food trucks are the new thing.  But I judge my tacos on the meat that is going inside them first, everything else is just sprinkles.  That being said, I tried 3 different meats that were going into the tacos, and they were all bland.  The big draw for people are the condiments and such that you get to put on top.  Otherwise, it is just a taco, no better, no worse.
