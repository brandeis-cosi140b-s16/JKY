So, first and foremost I don't think Sandbar is known for their food.
Below average Mexican food, served in a fun adult beach setting.

Saturday afternoon at 11 me and Mom stopped for lunch, nice day out, let's go enjoy a outdoor patio. 
Mom......breakfast burrito and 5-8 pieces of potatoes on her plate.
"How is it Mom?"........"ehh" was her reply.

ME.....on a protein bing lately.....Turkey burger. Bland......No taste period.
I had to douse it with hot sauce to get some type of taste from it. BUT their sweet potato fries were on point, maybe some of the best I've had.

Waitress was great and attentive. A+ for her.
I think this place is more the 20 something crowd at night to party. Food is not the specialty here.
