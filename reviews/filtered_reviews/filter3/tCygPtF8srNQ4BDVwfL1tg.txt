I really like that Macayo's has a refreshing Taco Salad instead of the normal slathered in lard refried beans & cheese salads that a lot of other places offer. This particular location is giant, with a big outdoor patio and a very large inside. I've only been here for work lunches so it's never crowded and the service has been fine. The menu has a lot of Tex-Mex choices so there is something for everyone. I really like the chips & salsa, enchiladas, and taco salad...nothing mind blowing but it's good for lunch.
