Simple concept, lots of choices, pretty tasty and inexpensive food. We didn't know how to order and the staff was exceptionally nice and motivated. There was also a pretty decent beer selection. The free cookie was awesome!! I would have given another star if the dining room wasn't so disgustingly dirty. Please hire someone to bus tables and keep the floor swept. A dirty front, makes me believe theres a SUPER dirty back...
