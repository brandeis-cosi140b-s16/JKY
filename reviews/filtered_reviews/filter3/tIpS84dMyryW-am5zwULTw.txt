My husband and I tried this little place because of all of the yelp reviews. We stayed on the strip and took cabs everywhere. A cab will get you here just fine, but good luck getting a cab back. We ended up walking the mile and a half back to the end of the strip. If you plan on doing this, I would say stick to lunch because the areas of town you will walk back through... not so good. 

We have a tremendous amount of authentic Mexican food places where we live so while I thought it was definitely yummy and didn't quite understand all of the hype. We ordered a small guacamole to start. It was very heavy on the onions and it felt like they added something in it to make it creamier. I would have rather it been simple with just avocados. Also while the salsa was really flavorful, the chips were too thick for my taste.

I had the fish fillet with the diavlo sauce and it was tasty. It was served with a white rice mix, beans, and a "salad" and really yummy corn tortillas. My husband got the chicken enchiladas and he said they were ok. 

Oh, and one other thing- their drink menu is limited. No iced tea!
