A definite 3 star evening. We enjoyed happy hour on the patio for a friend's birthday recently. It wasn't terribly busy for a Friday evening but the server told us it's very hoppin' on Saturdays as they have a live band etc. The Happy Hour margaritas were tasty but the food was just kind of ok. Nothing overwhelming at all. If you are trying to entice people to come back for dinner, I would think you would jazz up the tacos and other foods, but I guess considering they are on the HH menu, they have to keep it toned down to keep it cheap. The salsa is good albeit a little more blended than I prefer. The chips though are very bland. They are served cold and not seasoned at all. At least give them a little toss of salt while they are still hot though I have a feeling that these chips aren't made on premises. 

While I could be more generous with the stars based on the service we received, I can't give more than 3 stars because even though we asked if we would still receive happy hour price for our margaritas when we ordered another round at 7:15 and our server said 'of course!' we got charged regular price for them. :( Not cool...and we didn't notice until after we left. :(
