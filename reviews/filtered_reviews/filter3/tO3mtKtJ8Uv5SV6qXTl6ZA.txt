Decent tacos,  nothing special.  I've tried everything on the menu.  Price is right,  food is consistently solid.  Service friendly.  But I have no Idea why they have lines. Surprisingly I enjoyed the chicken more than the carne asada.  The salsa is good.  Stick to the tacos I wouldn't go for other things on limited menu.  I do applaud them for the limited menu, they have their niche and stick to it.
