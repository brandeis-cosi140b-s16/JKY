You will always have a great meal here because you start off with their chips and bean dip.  I also love their Pollo Fundido.  Everything that I have had on the menu has been great.  Their only problem is sometimes their service is not the greatest.  When they get busy it is pretty difficult to get drink refills and orders from the bar.  I was pretty bummed out that I had to eat most of my meal without a cold beer.
They also have a great outdoor patio and on some night have a DJ and music.  This really is a great place to dine.  With a few improvements, this place would really be excellent!
