From October 2011.

The food was great, the best part of this place.  Service was very good as well.

Initial impression was "you don't have a reservation?"  we were walkins and felt like it by the hostess.  We sat in the table closest to the door and the large cold drafts from the front door opening and closing wasn't much fun, my wife had to keep her jacket on.

So without the hostess and the cold draft in the equation, we had a great time.
