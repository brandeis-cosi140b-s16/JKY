My husband and I used to come here a lot- at least once every couple of weeks. This past year we have only gone once. The food just isn't as good as it used to be. I don't know what changed (maybe our taste?) but it's just not the same. The salsa is just ok, and the guac is gross- it has to be store bought...if not, I'd like to talk to the person who makes it. Beyond that, the rice, beans, margaritas, etc- they're all just ok. It doesn't taste like authentic Mexican food to me. 
The redeeming qualities for me are the service and the pollo rico- both are great. We have always had good experiences with service, and the pollo rico is always a safe bet. I'm not quite ready to give up on Nando's since it used to be a staple for us, but I definitely won't be going any more frequently than I have been.
