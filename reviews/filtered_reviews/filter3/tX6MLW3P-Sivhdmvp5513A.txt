The food was great; first bowl of chips were stale but the second was fresh so I was wondering. My boyfriend & I shared some chicken fajitas and they were delicious. Our waitress was nice however was a little slow on drink refills... Took us 20 min after we were finished eating that she finally brought the tab. The people at the front weren't very friendly she never greeted us all she said was "give me a few mins to seat you" lol very weird. I only gave 3 stars because the food was pretty good.
