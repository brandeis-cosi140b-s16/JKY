This one was kind of difficult to rate. I lived in New Mexico for quite a few years and go back there about 4 times a year so I'm very accustomed to the food and what it should be like.
Chips & salsa for $3.75?!?!?!?! Definitely not a NM restaurant thing, should be served for free. Wifey ordered the carne adovada enchiladas and enjoyed them and for $3 more you get rice, beans and a sopapilla, WTF again?!?! An upcharge of $3 is ridiculous for this!
I got the beef burrito smothered in geen chile and really enjoyed it. The green chile had a good flavor and a decent amount of heat but I would've preferred a little more. I also noticed for $1.50 you can order a sopapilla by itself, again, WTF?!?!? In NM sopapillas are complimentary just like chips & salsa.
Without the over charged meals and high prices for "add ons" that should be free, plastic silverware and tin foil plates, along with barely there customer service, it probably would've got 4 stars. I'd go there again but I wouldn't go out of my way or make a special trip to eat there in the future.
