Good people watching place. Food is just ok, did NOT like their salsa choices -- two chipotle and one very mild green pico. Drinks are spendy but you are right on the strip so what else can you expect? Use the drink coupons they hand out, it will save you a good $10 bucks. Sit at the bar or come when its not busy...its always busy so sit at the bar if you can.
