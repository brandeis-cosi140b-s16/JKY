I met a friend here for lunch and it was both of our first times. When I arrived, I parked next door at a mexican party shop. I am not sure if I was supposed to park there or not. Luckily I didn't get towed. Parking is not so fantastic there and you have to drive slowly down the street so you don't miss it. The restaurant is in a non-descriptive block. 
When I walked in, I loved the big wood chairs and tables. The feel was authentic mexican inside. We grew up going to Mexico every family vacation and my parents always liked to go to the non-touristy spots, especially in Cancun downtown. This restaurant reminded me of the Yucatan-inspired restaurant we visited that was right next to the bull fighting arena. So did some of the items on the menu. There was a mini bar for the salsas, and I think they had about 6 out. I wish they put a name card out for them so you knew what they were. I decided to grab a few different ones and see which I liked best. None of them were outstanding, but I did enjoy the unique, but hot strawberry salsa. I  decided to try a corn quesadilla off the menu, looking forward to real mexican queso in my meal. I ordered the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Quesa. It had Oaxaca cheese, roasted pork shoulder with achiote rojo and Mexican herbs. It was delicious, though, it was so filling, I could only eat half.  I was unhappy about the tortilla chips.  They tasted old and stale. I figured they'd be fresh and hot from the fryer since I got there right when they opened. 
I need to go back again so I can really get a feel for more of the food and atmosphere. I think this is a review-in progress situation...
