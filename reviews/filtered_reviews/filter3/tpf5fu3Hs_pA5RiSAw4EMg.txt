La Pinata has a kick ass sign!!
The place inside is pretty lack luster and drab.

Margaritas are decent but not as good as some of these rave reviews.
Big portions of food but still kind of over pricey for what it actually is.

Husband has a tasty green tamale, decent cheese enchilada and so-so beef taco.  I got the black bean and rice burrito, big in size, beans very bland.
We got a green chile cheese crisp to start, that was good, they have a good cheese blend.

Our service was fantastic so he got tipped very well.  Good service is hard to come by.

As for Mexican food, Rositas on 22nd and McDowell is still my favorite for food and margs.  Not affiliated with any other Rositas in the valley.
