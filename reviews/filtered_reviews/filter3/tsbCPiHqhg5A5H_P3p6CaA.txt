I don't get why this place always has a line. Is it because it's trendy? It's ok... I mean, for nachos. The problem I have is that the nachos always get cold before you're half way through. If you're looking for an easy place for a larger group this does the trick. The have some fun drinks... I.e: the scorpion shot - drink at your own risk!
