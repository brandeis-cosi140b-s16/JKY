The food at this place really only deserves two stars, but it's a decent enough restaurant to grab Mexican food with a large group while out in Scottsdale, so three stars it is... 

I used to come to this place every now and then with friends while living in Scottsdale, and we all agreed that it was mostly for convenience & the fact that the people who own the place are very nice. In other words we didn't come for great Mexican food,.. 

I came here recently with four other people (one of which was a child) while visiting Scottsdale. I ordered a combination plate with a green corn tamale, chile relleno, beans, and rice. The beans & rice were kind of bland, but not bad. The chile relleno & tamale were both covered in the same green sauce, which was also kind of bland. None of the food was bad, just bland. Actually, the chile relleno was pretty good (it was cheesy). 

The group I was with ordered queso dip w/spinach as an appetizer, which was actually pretty good! I have to say the chips & salsa here are pretty damn tasty as well! 

The service is friendly, but kind of slow and not very attentive (everyone who works here is nice though, so I guess they make up for there shortcoming by serving with kindness). It took us awhile to get drink refills, but the food came pretty quickly. One thing that I think is really nice here is that they will allow you to pay at the front counter if you need to divide up a bill. As far as pricing goes I actually think it's a little on the higher side for the quality and what you actually get, but it's not horrible. My meal was $13 or $14 and I did have leftovers. In terms of atmosphere, it's cheesy Mexican decor (that's not a good thing or a bad thing...it's just what it is). 

When I'm back in Scottsdale and want Mexican food I'm sure this place will get suggested. I won't be the one suggesting it, but I wouldn't be opposed to it if someone else did.
