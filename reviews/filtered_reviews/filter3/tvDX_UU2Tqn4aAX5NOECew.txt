Ok so the quality of food seems to decrease with every time we go there. I don't know but the last 2 times I went to Viva Zapatas, I left the restaurant a little disappointed. Today we tried the Nachos and they were not that good for close to $10. I have had better ones at Robertos. 

Also, last time we were there and asked for military discount, the guy told us they give discount only if we are in uniform. After we asked him to go ask the manager he came back with a split check and wanted to give only my husband the 10%!!! WHAT? Then I said, well I have an ID too and then he had to go and fix the bill again.
