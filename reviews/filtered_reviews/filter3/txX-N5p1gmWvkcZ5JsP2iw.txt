I have been coming to Popo's for some time now when there was just the location on Indian School.  The food has always been really good, but this last visit wasn't great.  We ALWAYS start with the chili con queso, because it is AMAZING!!!!! If you haven't tried it, you must!!  the chips and salsa were great as well. The only thing I can say about the salsa is that when we have gone there its not always consistent...sometimes its a little too spicy and other times its just right.   I ordered the carne asada burrito ala carte and my husband ordered steak fajitas.  My burrito was just o.k.  I had more pico de gallo in the burrito than steak! It was served on an extremely small plate with garnish on the side, the typical lettuce, tomato, etc.  I decided to eat my burrito with a fork and knife.  When I was trying to cut it up everything was falling off the plate due to the plate being way too small, the table was a mess!! My husband said his steak for the fajitas was way to fatty/chewy and he could hardly chew it.  The more he ate the more he was put off by it.  Not the best experience that we have had there.  We will go back but maybe to the Indian School location next time.
