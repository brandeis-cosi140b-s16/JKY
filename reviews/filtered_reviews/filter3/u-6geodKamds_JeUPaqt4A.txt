For a modern, non-authentic Mexican joint, it's pretty good! Priced pretty cheap.  For a burrito or taco and chips, you pay like $7, but it does fill you up.

It's great spot for Lunch.  I usually call in and pick-up, you wait a little bit for some reason after they say it takes 10 minutes over the phone considering it takes me a good 10 minutes to get there! hehehe!

Limited seating inside and outside, but clean and modern.
