Blackened scallops? Yep. 
Brunch? Yep.
Southwest flare? Yep. 
Cocktails, happy hour, noisy bar, eclectic seating? Yep, yep yep yep. 

There's no sign on the door, no flash or flare, but if you scoot up the sidewalk from Luci's you'll find a door and behind that door... well you'll see!  If you turn left into the bar, it's a high-top, bistro style, kinda homey kinda shwank type of place. If you turn right it's saltio tile, booths and tables (and the loo) in the very typical Phoenix Mexican Restaurant visual tradition. Either way, the food is worth trying (but believe them when they warn you about the heat) and the atmosphere is comfortable. 

Now, you just have to find it!
