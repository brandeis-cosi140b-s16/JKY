The food was decent. I asked for my lobster tacos to be grilled and it came over cooked and fried which i wasn't happy about but when you've been drinking all day being upset or sending it back wasn't an option anymore. I ate it and still was unpleased but thankfully my friends ordered steak tacos and i was happy about that. 

The carne asada was peppered steak and the cheese was super yum. The end result my stomach was full and I was able to go in. 

I also came the next day and ordered the 2 for 1 happy hour special and I got super crunk! Friday night was club night and sat night they had the fight and a mechanical
Bull which looked fun!
