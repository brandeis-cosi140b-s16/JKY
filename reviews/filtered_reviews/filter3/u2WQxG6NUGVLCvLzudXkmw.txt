The logistics of this place are stupid and deserve a 1 star, but the food is 5 stars all the way! My San Diego family has got me hooked on Tacos El Gordo.. I can only get it when I visit them.  You can imagine my surprise and happiness to find they have a location in Vegas! I sure did walk 20 minutes from my hotel in the scorching hot to eat me some adobada and asada tacos. By the time we got there, we were so ready. Then to our dismay, we opened the door to find the line up to the door, almost out the door. Darn! So we got in the line that looked shortest and waited. And waited more. As we got closer, our hearts sank.  We noticed that there were separate lines depending on types of meat.  I wanted asada and adobada, which meant I had to stand in line twice! Then if you want a drink, it's a separate line. Fries? Separate line. LAME! I don't remember San Diego locations being so asinine! So we split up and got into the lines we needed and placed orders for each other. The lines were about 15 minutes each... so I can't imagine 1 person wanting to do the not so unusual act of ordering more than one thing..they'd be there all day! Oh and then there is a separate line to pay.  Basically, don't come here starving, because it'll be awhile before you eat. Not to mention the place is friggin packed, but that's only because it's so good. 

But let me tell you, when you finally do get to eat, it'll be the best tacos you ever had. You'll probably overeat and not regret it. You'll wonder why you ever thought Taco Bell tacos were actually tacos.  I was definitely on my gordita status that day and it was well worth it.
