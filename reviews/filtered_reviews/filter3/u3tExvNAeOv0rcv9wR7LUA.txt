I love mexican food. I also love good prices and good quality (home made flavour) so this review is based in my perspective.....

We made reservations (for two) got there on time, we were seated rigth away.
Waiters were all friendly and fast.

Food was good i got the carnitas its served with rice, beans,salsa,tortillas,guacamole. Since its a fancy restaurant ($$) u get ur plate n everything is looking cute,pretty n smaller proportion, (im more the type of big portions served all over the plate lol)  
Taste: carnitas were soft n moist, falling off the bone. Beans tasted homemade. Guacamole was good. Salsa was ok. 

So we asked for the house spicier salsa if they had one n they did! and i mean spicy homemade salsa, (u only get it if u order it)  it was really good habanero salsa, do not order unless u like it super spicy .... otherwise stick with :it says hot in the bottle but its really not : cholula.

Javiers margarita was 15 bucks, pricey for a drink.... It was ok 

Dessert: fried icecream, it was vanilla icecream on top of a mexican bunuelo  ( fried dough with cinammon n sugar) it was tasty.

Restaurant itself: this was the reason why we decide to dine here, the decor looks so cool n unique, comfy chairs.

So overall food is good - no complaints there, but pricey. It was round 100 bucks for our dinner, kinda pricey for me,  but if you like mexican food, good service and fancy ambient come here.
