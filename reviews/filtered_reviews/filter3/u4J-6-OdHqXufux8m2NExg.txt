This is your normal Mexican restaurant. Although I eat there at least twice a week, I do not think there is anything special about the food. I do love their bean and cheese burrito but that isn't all that hard to make. 

The atmosphere is very casual and there are always kids there. If you can enjoy your meal while sitting in a loud place, then Rosita's is for you. I usually get my food to-go. 

The service is good as well, but once again it's nothing special.
