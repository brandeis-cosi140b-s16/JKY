Decent salsa. Weird guacamole. Good tortillas. Great carne asada. Flowery horchata. No shrimp or fish tacos. Overpriced Mexican sodas. Good beans. Decent chips. No pork. Three stars. 

Fix the guacamole. Consider adding fish/shrimp. Price the Mexican sodas at more like 99 cents. Definitely get some carnitas on that menu. Then you get 5 stars.
