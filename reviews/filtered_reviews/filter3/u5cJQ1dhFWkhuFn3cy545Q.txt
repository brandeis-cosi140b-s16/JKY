Fairly decent Mexican place with great outdoor seating (although we got swarmed by bees so had to relocate indoors). I was pretty shocked at how pricey our meal was: $40 for 6 tacos, chips, salsa, guac and 2 margs for two people. The tacos are really small so 3 is pretty standard fare. 

That said the flavor of the al pastor was good, and the salsa tasted fresh and spicy. Would be a great place to visit during their happy hour.
