The chicken tacos are arguably some of the best in town! The guacamole is a little too creamy for my taste. I prefer my guac to be made table side. Plus the fact that they get from the bartender makes me think that there's just a big vat of guac behind the bar. And that's the first thing you're asked when seated "Would you like guacamole?" I haven't had much else, I think the chile relleno was pretty tasty as well. Would give them 4 stars just for the chicken tacos, but the guac makes me take a star away.
