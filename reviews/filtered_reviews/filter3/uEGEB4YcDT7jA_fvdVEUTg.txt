I really prefer the other Nando's in Gilbert. The service at this location is terrible, but what do you expect from high school students? This staff needs some help with time management and what to do when the restaurant isn't busy but you still have tables to serve. As with the other Nando's, decent chips and salsa, lots of vegetarian choices (potato jack flauta  and black beans are really good), and a tasty margaritas. They do like to smother some of their items in cheese so be ready.
