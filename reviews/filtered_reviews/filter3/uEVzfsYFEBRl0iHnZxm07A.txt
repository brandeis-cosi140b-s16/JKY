This place is good for happy hour or day drinking during the week.  I can't say that I would go on the weekend because it just isn't my crowd. It tends to cater to the young and hip crowd who think that a drink called "The Donkey Punch" is hilarious in its irony.

The food is ok, the drink specials are pretty good and the fact that it is mostly outdoors is awesome 8 months out of the year.  It is a fun place to go for a work happy hour.
