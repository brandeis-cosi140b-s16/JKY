okay this place is called pink tacos, if you were expecting authentic you must be trippin'.  PINK TACOS.. PINK FREAKIN TACOS.. TACOS OF PINK COLOR.. What part of that makes you think, ooooh authentic mexican flare? UHH nothing... 

It's a large restaurant located in the hard rock that has decent tasting food.  I ordered the pink tacos, after all you always eat something they name the restaurant after right?? To be honest they weren't half bad.. Had a nice flavor, far from authentic, but certainly edible. :)

Servers were on it and my friend said his margarita was DELISH!  Let's be real, i wasn't about to start my drinking at 11 am when i stayed up till 5 am the night before.. NOT HAPPENING!!!

The best part of this place is the massive amounts of chips and salsa.. I gnoshed on that all throughout the meal.. 

This may be the perfect spot when they open up the deck to the pool area.  I can see this place bustling during the spring and summer just because theres a bar and food right by the pool.. 

For gosh sake, this place is called pink taco, for that reason alone you should give it a shot. Just don't expect truly authentic mexican food.. Jus' sayin'.
