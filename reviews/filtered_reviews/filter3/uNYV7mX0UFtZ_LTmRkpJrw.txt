We have been excitedly awaiting the opening of this restaurant for a few months now. We finally tried it for lunch today and unfortunately we were dissapointed. The food was just okay and the service was definitely lacking. We ordered the guacamole and it was extremely salty. In all fairness when we complained about it they took it back but unfortunately the one they brought out was also super salty. I suggest that they train their servers better so they can answer questions about items offered on their menu specially for people with food allergies. Maybe they were just having an off day. We may try them again in the future.
