I like to reserve my 4-5 stars for places that totally blew my mind...though this comes extremely close! Pretty confusing that Vida and Vida Vida are two different restaurants, but the more elegant section has good food, decent drinks, and the bartender was very helpful in food and drink selections. The skinny margarita is not excellent but it is mostly tequila and artificial sweetener so, for what it is it's okay. Other margaritas are okay but they don't have much of a drink selection otherwise. Overall a good experience.
