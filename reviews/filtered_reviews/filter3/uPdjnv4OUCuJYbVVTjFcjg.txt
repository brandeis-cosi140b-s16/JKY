Great Mexican food! Authentic and clean eating. I ordered 3 carne asada & 2 chicken tacos w/corn tortillas for our little family of 3. My son had 1 carne asada and my each had 1 of each.

This place is great for kids because you choose everything you want on it and everything is a-la-cart. I added guacamole and pico de gallo to mine and my sons was dry. 

The meat is REAL! Not from a can or frozen. They have a large salsa station, fountain drink dispenser and Mexican sodas you can purchase. 

Its a little confusing when you come in but here is how it works: 

1. Walk in and walk towards the meat station. Here there are 3 lines, this is where you choose your meal and your meat choice. 

2. Walk to your left and proceed to add anything you want to your order. Add an ear of corn and all the trimmings (like the "elote man" from the park in the hood). 

3. Pay 

4. Add your salsa fixings from the salsa station and load up on the limes  

5. Sit anywhere you want. Grab a high chair for the kids while you dispense your soda and fially.. 

6. Enjoy! 

If you need to use the restroom, you can find them on the right of the restaurant. 

NOTE: There is not a changing table in the womans or mens bathroom so make sure you bring something to lay on the floor to change your child or just go out to the car and do it there.

I highly recommend this place for your family to eat out at.
