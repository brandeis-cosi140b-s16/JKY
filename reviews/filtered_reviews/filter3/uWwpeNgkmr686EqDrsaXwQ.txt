I had a flight to SF that was departing from a gate near this place and wanted to grab a bite before I boarded.  It looked like a cool place and offered some menu items that looked good.  After browsing the menu, I ordered:

Nitro Nachos, $8.95

Quesadilla, $6.95 + Peppers, $2

1L Water, $3

The Nachos were pretty good, but messy.  I had to eat 1/2 of the dish with a fork because the bottom half was soaked in Queso Cheese.  I don't recommend ordering this to take on a plane....it's not plane friendly as you will get messy.

The Quesadilla was very interesting.  I ordered it with the Peppers, which was an additional $2....it actually came with Peppers & Onions.  It tasted like an Italian Pepper & Onions Sandwich.....which was good, but unexpected.

Overall, I thought the food was pretty good for airport food.
