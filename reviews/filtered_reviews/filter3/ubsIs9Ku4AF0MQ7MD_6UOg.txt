Unfortunately I have to agree with all of the so-so reviews. My sister and I dined here on a Saturday evening. Although our waiter was quite attentive to us, the meal was just so so for the cost. 
We ordered the mole chicken and Kobe beef tacos. We like to split things often, so it was great that they did it for us in the kitchen, very appreciated. Both were delicious items, but worth what was charged? No. We had margaritas too, which were quite tasty, however just don't think the whole meal was worth over $100.
