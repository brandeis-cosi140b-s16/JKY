I had originally seen the other listing for this Restaurant which had the place rated at four stars rather than 2.75; and after being there I wish I would have seen this one first.

2.75 stars is the perfect place for the ratings to rest - La Parrilla Suiza is lackluster, tolerable Mexican food at it's best.

To be fair - the staff is extremely nice and attentive.  Being a Sunday early afternoon it was imperative that my water was replenished frequently and it was.  Our waitress was great!  The food itself was pretty good as well - I ordered an enchilada and had the tortilla soup which was very good.  

The part that knocks a plausible four stars down to three is the lack of character in the restaurant - it's just a big, open, area with vaguely Mexican-oriented decorations.  The pricing was average for Americanized places - ranging from about $9.50 - $14.00 a plate.  

There is a full bar which I would have definitely taken advantage of had it not been a Sunday and the beers been less than $4.50 a piece.  

Overall - If it's not too out of your way and you're in a bind, La Parrilla Suiza won't be the worst choice.  I'd much rather head to either an authentic place like Salazar Brothers or a slightly more upscale place like El Zocalo.
