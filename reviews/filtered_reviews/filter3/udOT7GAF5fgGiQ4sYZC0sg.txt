I'm torn. I had high expectations for obvious reasons - rave reviews and an average of 4.5 stars - and who doesn't appreciate a good fusion menu? I want to believe that those expectations caused my less-than-awesome experience, but nevertheless, I wasn't impressed.

My friend (who is a big fan) and I shared a half order of Bulgogi Nachos, Fusion Flautas, Fusion Tamal with Bulgogi, and full order of Kimchee Fried Rice with Pork. I've heard the buzz around these fusion nachos, so I was most excited to try them. The Bulgogi: tasty, but a rather sweet marinade; nothing spectacular as Korean marinated beef goes. The chips were okay. I like that they're housemade, but our batch lacked the crunch it needed. The pico de gallo was fresh and delicious. I thought the use of Gochujang (Korean red pepper paste) as a sauce was a nice touch. Overall, just a shrug. I could do without it. I liked the crunch achieved on the fresh tortilla on the Flautas, but again, no sparks. The guacamole and gochujang sauce was interesting! The Tamal was dry and surprisingly flavorless (my friend agreed). Lastly, the Kimchee Fried Rice was flavorful and spicy! Neither of us really cared for it, but I won't deny that it was good. 

When you don't like something that is extremely popular, you find yourself having to explain your reasoning in great detail. The food is okay, borderline good. I may have enjoyed it more without the high expectations of these dishes being "amazing." It's certainly not better or superior to their Mexican counterparts (I would choose carne asada nachos over bulgogi nachos every time) and as Korean cuisine, it lacks. The good stuff? The portions are generous and the price is right! I am willing to give the place another whirl though. Who doesn't believe in second chances?
