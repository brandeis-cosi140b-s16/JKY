Get the sangria. Great stuff. The seating by the "canals" under the bright blue "sky" was awesome, but the food was so-so. The chips we got were pretty stale, and my pork was quite on the non-juicy side. Everyone left full and fairly happy, though; it's Vegas, I'm pretty sure you all know that you just need a few drinks to have a good time anywhere ^_^.
