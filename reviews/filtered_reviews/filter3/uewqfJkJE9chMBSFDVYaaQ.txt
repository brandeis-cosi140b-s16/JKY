Been here a few times now and each time has been completely different.

First time: 

My friend I watched the football game - it was kinda quiet and our server was brand new. She didn't really know what beers were on offer or what kind of food was being served. I wouldn't've done any better, so I can sympathise with someone in her position. No draft beers were being sold, so we stuck with bottles and and ordered Chips and 4 tacos. I had no complaints

Second time:

4 of us were watching another football game in a booth - The first server was nice and did what was expected. Draft beers were being sold this time, and the food was as expected for the price we paid. We then moved outside and got a new server. Ordered a Bloody Mary and did not receive my Bacon and Celery, as advertised. The server said it doesn't come with these 2 food items (but their menu states it does). The propane was out and they had no reserves.. We left shortly after this

Third time:

Disaster! - Again, we went to watch a football game. It was a nice day and very busy. Again, we were told they were not serving draft beer (what bar doesn't serve draft!). I ordered that beer/ margarita thing and it just tasted of the margarita mix.. We ordered Chips at the very beginning only to see new people sitting down get theirs before us. We ordered food, but this took forever, so the server spoke to her manager who immediately came over to apologise. The food was cancelled and we were given a round of shots for our troubles.

The manager, Brittany Flippen, gave me her business card and said to contact her should we have any concerns.

The whole experience didn't really phase me too much. I understand its a new place experiencing teething issues along with new servers. They should close down until all issues are rectified or continue to push customers away with sub-par service.

I'll probably go back again, but I'll call ahead this time to make sure everything is in order
