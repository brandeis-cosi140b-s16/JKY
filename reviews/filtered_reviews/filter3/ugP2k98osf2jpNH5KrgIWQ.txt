You may have heard this before :"Just Ok" 

That is exactly how I feel about El Segundo. Service was pretty mediocre, with the server not really seeming to want to be there and just an overall feeling of 'slow' from everyone including the manager on duty. 

The Happy Hour Prices are good enough, but the food is bland and not really very exciting. I know that you can't exactly expect too much from Mexican Style" Happy Hour done on a corporate scale.. but you can hope.  My hopes were crushed. My dreams have changed...lol. I now stick the old favorites where I get the authentic stuff. 

I am not anticipating a trip back to El Segundo.. but if I ever get back there, I  hope it is a better experience! Happy Eating!
