We went here for happy hour because we thought they had a pretty good hh menu. sooooooo....The interior of this place is beautiful! The service was good. 3.50 for all beers, heck yes! Onto the food I go; the tostadas and salsa was pretty good, nothing special. my boyfriend ordered the shrimp cocktail which was ok, nothing to rave about, I actually like the one from food city better. I got the shrimp "cucarachas" ( it was kind of disturbing they were calling it cockroaches) anyway so it came it and it was whole shrimp with eyes and everything...they looked like cockroaches :/...they were too spicy to enjoy. 

The prices for the appetizers didn't seem bad until the portions came out. The portions are able to fill up a 3 year old. It's definitely overpriced for less than mediocre food. Brio next door has a better happy hour and better food.
