First time in. It was 10pm on a Friday. The place was absolutely dead, so we got to sit wherever we wanted ;) our server was very nice, and quick since she didn't have to worry about anybody else. 

We ordered nachos, a large beer and a margarita. All three were great, but the prices were a little tough to swallow (pun intended). Don't get me wrong, the margarita was very well done, and the spicy shrimp nachos were excellent as well. The $15 dollar price tag wasn't worth the portion size. Our bill came to $45 or so after taxes, and I just didn't think it warranted what we ordered. 

We'll be back again in the future, but I don't think we'll make this a regular stop. I think a price adjustment in the future is probably warranted (I think they've only been open for a week or so) and if so I think we'd come more often.

At the end of the day it's worth a look, and they have a pretty extensive tequila list that might be fun.
