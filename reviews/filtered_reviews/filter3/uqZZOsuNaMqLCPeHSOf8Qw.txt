I've been a fan of Chipotle since 1998 when they opened their first non-Colorado locationn in Kansas City, MO. Over the years when you walk into any Chipotle like this one at Arroyo Crossing you know what you're going to find. The menu is the same, you know their food with integrity background so you're getting organic products as much as possible. But just in case you've never been to a Chipotle before the other Yelp reviews can tell you how good the food itself is. 

So this review looks at...space...and cleanliness. The Arroyo Crossing location feels a bit smaller in floor space than some of their other Vegas locations. This location is one where I found full trash cans on more than one occasion. I've also had to ask for drink cup lids more than once. In short it's Chipotle, but not as good as it could be. It does have a row of seats along side the East wall that goes all the way to the back door. Some people like to eat without being in the middle of a lot of people and this location can offer that. And it does have nice sized parking area that's not as hard to get in and out of as some of their other locations are in the valley. 

Overall rating: 3 Stars.
