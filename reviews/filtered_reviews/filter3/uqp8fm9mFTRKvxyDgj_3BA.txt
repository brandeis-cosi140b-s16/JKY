We decided to eat here on New Years Eve.  When we walked up the decor is pretty much the same as any other mexican restaurant.  We got a table for 3 and were told the wait would be about 25 minutes so we headed to the bar for a drink.  The bar tender was a little stand offish as we told him we were only waiting for a table.  We asked for some chips and salsa while we waited and he said he couldnt give them to us because we were not eating at the bar.  I insisted that we would pay for them but he did not bring them.  Our table was ready in about 10 minutes.  The menu is pretty standard with a few variations here and there.  

When we saw our waitress she was scatter brained and not sure what was going on.  We finally got our food and it was surprisingly good.  Our over all experience would have been better if our service was at a level that is to be expected when eating out.  I have spoken to friends who live in the area and they said the same thing.  " Food is great, service blows".  So if we ever eat here again it will be carry out only.
