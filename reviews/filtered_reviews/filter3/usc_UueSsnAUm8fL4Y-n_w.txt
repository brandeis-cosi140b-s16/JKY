I've been here numerous times, always for their hot dogs. Their hotdogs are great! Very unique combinations. I love the #4, 7 and 10.
If you have your work badge on when you order, you get a free drink.
Had I only ever had their hotdogs, this would be a 5 star review.

However the past two times I went, I had Mexican food. A week ago I ordered the chicken quesadilla and most recently I ordered the carne asada burro.
The chicken was well cooked, tender and moist, but it had obviously been boiled in water. Just water. Nothing else. No seasonings. And there was so much chicken (normally not a complaint) that I couldn't taste the cheese.
The last visit was just a mess all around. My friend ordered the chicken burro and a large side of guacamole. The order comes out as usual, in a paper bag. Within a few seconds, we found that during the 10 ft walk to bring it out to us, two of the salsa contairs had opened and spilled everywhere. So everything had a coating of salsa on it. What a mess. But again, nothing was seasoned!! Neither the chicken or carne asada had any flavor to it. The guacamole was just mashed up avocado. No salt or pepper even! 
Big disappointment!

Hotdogs - 5 stars
Mexican Food - 1 star
