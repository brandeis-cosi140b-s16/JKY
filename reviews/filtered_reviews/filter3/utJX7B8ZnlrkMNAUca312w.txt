I don't know what it is but I just thought the quality has gone down since when we used to come here all the time. The salsa was very bland and extremely thin. I like my salsa thick and chunky. The chips were good however. We started off with a cheese crisp and a side of guacamole. I liked how the cheese crisp came with a side if diced green chilis but they were cold. Would have been much better if they would have cooked them onto it. The guacamole was alright however I found myself adding a bit of salt for flavor. There were three of us and we ordered a 1/2 pound of shrimp and a 1/2 pound of chicken. They really skimp on the bell peppers. You only get one little slice on the top and it's not even grilled in with the rest of the onions. In my opinion bell peppers are a normal part of fajitas - not an afterthought. The homemade tortillas they serve you are good although they are much bigger and thicker than they used to be. I definitely do not like that change. I prefer smaller thinner ones so you can eat more of them since I like to mix them up and have a different variety of toppings on each one. So it was an okay dinner but not someplace I am going to run back to anytime soon.
