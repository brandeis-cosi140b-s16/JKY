This place is pretty tasty. And the food is served fast! 

The place is quite small. We were a large group and we had to split up over several tables. 

The tacos were very good. I was pretty satisfied with them. However, the fries were definitely over-fried. After a few, I felt one of my arteries would clog from all the grease they were oozing. I love fries, and I know they're not healthy, but these were definitely too much. 

They had a good selection of sauces and toppings to put on the tacos, and several saucers of each on a little salad bar thing, so there wasn't much of a hold-up with that. 

Overall, the place is pretty okay, and if I'm close by and craving fish tacos, I'll definitely stop by!
