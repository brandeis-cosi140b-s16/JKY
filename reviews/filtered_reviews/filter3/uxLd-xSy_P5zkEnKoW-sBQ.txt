Tasty....but I hope people realize the food is frozen.  We had some pretty good burgers.  The sides are all frozen item.  But the ambiance is gross.  The lights that hang down are out of place.  While the servers don't really clean the tables.  I would suggest never eating in their establishment and would be better off getting food to go.  And maybe getting fried sides from a fast food establishment instead.  It's also odd how you have to ask the register clerk for refills.  But again they do have some tasty toppings for their burgers.  Ehhh.....haven't been back in over a year.
