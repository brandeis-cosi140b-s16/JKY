Second time here. The first time I believe I tried the nachos. The food is good. It is not authentic but it is very good. The nachos were huge and were shared with 2 other people. The second time I had the grilled fish tacos with chipotle mayo and they were so delicious and spicy especially since I added their very own hot sauce which tasted amazing. I also had a michelada which hit the spot after a wild night out.  The drinks are strong and they have a good happy hour special. I would definitely recommend this place is you're in Las Vegas. They have screens that show whatever sport is on.
