New Mexican cuisine.  New Mexico...as in the state of.   There must be some fat folks in New Mexico...cuz the portions are outrageous!  Huge chunks of pork, tender and delicious. This food focuses on the chile.  Your choice of green or red.  I chose the green due to the promise of spice.  Not happening for me.  I am, however, jaded by my love of Thai food.  No runny nose, or stinging lips.  I could feed this to my granddaughter. They were, however, packed with great chile taste.
We tried the burrito, with adovada, Navajo taco, green chile stew, and sopapilla.  Everything we had could feed an army...so plan accordingly.
