Atmosphere is hip. Service is very good. Music a little loud. We each had a crispy fish taco. Notice I said taco... not tacos. We expected a little more food based on the price. The tacos here are pretty small. The taco was good but too watery (don't know what that juice was dripping all over my plate). Chips are ok, salsa ok. When I compare what I get from the popular local fast food fish taco place and other Mexican restaurants I have to wonder if this business plan will work.

Quality is ok. Too expensive for what you get. I don't mind spending the money if I feel I am getting my money's worth. Don't know if we will go back or not... probably not.
