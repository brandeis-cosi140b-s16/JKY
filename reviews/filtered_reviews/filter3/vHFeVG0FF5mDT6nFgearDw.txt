The blood organge margarita was the best part of my meal. The complementary chips and salsa were decent but the chips were thick. I had the braised green chili pork tacos and they were loaded way to much with the pork filling. The side of rice was mushy and overdone. The decor is pretty awesome but I would not go again unless it was happy hour.
