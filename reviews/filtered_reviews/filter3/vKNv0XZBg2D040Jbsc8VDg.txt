Great place for lunch. Not as much of a dinner place, but I guess you could opt for one of their massive burritos.

I had one of their salads, which are pretty massive and served on a tasty tortilla shell. They use plenty of chicken and offered a tasty cilantro dressing. It's pretty much what you'd expect from a mexican style salad but I reiterate that the portion was very impressive. My friend was only able to finish half of hers and I was pretty stuffed by the time I got through mine. The chicken is well seasoned, the salsas are good. 

I guess what I'm saying though, is that as good as this place was, it didn't blow me away or impress me anymore than a routine trip to Chipotle would. 
I definitely recommend you try it out though-- if you are a fan of trendy mexican food you'll be glad you did.
