Combo Margarita Sampler is a great idea.  You can sample 3 different margaritas at a time.  The Oyster  appetizer was fishy and that means it's not fresh, it was bad. I won't get that again.  The Carne Asada meal was delicious. I made the mistake of getting it medium rare. It should be medium well. I don't even know why they ask you, it's not steak. I will probably come back for HH to try more...
