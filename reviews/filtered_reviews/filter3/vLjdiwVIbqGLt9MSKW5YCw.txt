Yes, the NyNy is cute as are all the restaurants on the "city streets".  Service was good but the food was not outstanding.  Ordered the specials (steak and chicken/shrimp enchilada) and didn't compare well to our small town Mexican restaurant.  They did come with "free" Marqueritas but never easy to tell the tequilla content in these.
