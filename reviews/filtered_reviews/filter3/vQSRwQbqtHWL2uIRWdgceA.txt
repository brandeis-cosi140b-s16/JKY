First time here? Free tamale y'all ! Green sweet corn...and it's huge. Yum. 

Very tasty prickly pear margaritas served in a very fun tall glass. Only place I've seen outside of Aqui that has this sweet little gem.

Steak salad had a ton of steak, and my hub liked his dish too. Quick service, cute patio...nice lunch. Surprising find in a strip mall. Fun way to start an anniversary mini-vacation.
