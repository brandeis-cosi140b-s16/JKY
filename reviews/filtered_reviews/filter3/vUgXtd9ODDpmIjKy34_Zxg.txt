The service was a little slow, the drinks were good, the prices were right, the food was meh. I'm from CA I've heard our Mexican food is pretty authentic here, but I got a chicken quesadilla... How can you screw that one up right? Should be easy... well the chicken inside was weird and not seasoned like Mexican food should be seasoned. It just wasn't what I was expecting... at all.  Alas, maybe the kitchen was off, or I'm used to the amazing food back where I live, but it was just ehhh. I wouldn't order food here again, but you can't go wrong with a yinzerita from here!
