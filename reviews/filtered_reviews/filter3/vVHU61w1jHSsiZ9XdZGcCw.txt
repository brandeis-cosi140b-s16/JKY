After all of the hype this places seems to have I must say that I didn't really see what all the rave was about. 

Pro's:
Quick Service
Unique Atmosphere
Great Chips & Salsa

Con's:
Dishes are to big, and quality is lacking.
Servers are not a knowledgeable as they should be

Will we go back? Maybe..........
