We visited there on a Friday night....sometimes the best time to see a restaurants potential is when the placed is packed.  Out waitress was friendly, informative and seemed eager to assist.  Good, I like being taken care of.  There were just two of us so we sat at a small 2-top near the front door. Seating was minimal inside...had the weather been warmer, we would have loved to sit outside but bit the case that evening.  Chips and Salsa were brought out immediately and were quite flavorful.  The Salsa is mild but there were two other variations which would melt plastic  so be wary.  I love it HOT but not everyone can handle it.  We ordered two Margarita's on the rock, the house blend, nothing special and they were nice, just what the DR. ordered.  My dining companion had a child's-plate of Cheese Enchilada, rice and beans.  I ordered the Spanish Flag Enchilada's, one chicken, one beef and the other spinach.  The food came quickly and was piping hot!  The beans were good but the Spanish Rice was institutional at best.  Mixing the two together was the way to make them palatable.  The Cheese Enchilada was tasty as were my three.  The Chicken was shredded, as was the Beef and the Spinach very creamy.   We chose not to try dessert this time and the check came quickly.  Not a bad night out but very simple dinner at best.  I think the service trumps the quality of the food more than anything.  A few good Margarita's will take care of that any time!  For a quick and easy meal that's affordable, it worked well for me.
