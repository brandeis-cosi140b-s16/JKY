I really like the patio at this Sam's. You get a nice view of the Arizona Center, pretty lights and water sculptures. It is great for people watching, and killing some time while waiting for a movie to start. That is really the only time I go to Sam's - PreMovie. 

Get the chips and salsa, they serve a mix of sweet potato and regular tortilla chips. The salsa is gringalicious (not spicy at all,  but still pretty tasty).

We started with the sampler (probably a mistake for only 2 people as it was huge) it had mushroom quesadilla, spring rolls, turkey sliders and a salad. It was pretty good, but would have been better for a group of 6.

I ordered the steak and cake for my main. It was a chile-rubbed sirloin accompanied by a big fat delicious crab cake. It was served with sweet mashed potatoes and veggies. The sweet mashed potatoes were almost as good as those at Sierra Bonita... Almost. 

This was a great meal and reminded me not to forget about Sam's when I have to return to the Arizona Center.
