3 stars at best. There is always a line, so I was really excited to try this place. Having just returned from Southern California, where they do Mexican food very well, I had heard good things and I had hopes. I got the carne asada burrito, kind of pricy, and it was just fine. Only fine. I felt three quarters of it was lettuce. It was good sized and I took the rest of it home. I smothered it with cheese and extra salsa and sour cream after reheating and it was much better the second time around. I probably won't be returning any time soon.
