if your in the mood for cheap greasy Mexican food you found the right place, food is not that bad it is a little too salty don't even try the soup if you cant take a pound of salt. If your craving Mexican it does the trick cant beat the price the chips & salsa are free with any meal and it is the best part I would compare it to filibertos it it were a restaurant that served you only thing is El Palacio has better salsa
