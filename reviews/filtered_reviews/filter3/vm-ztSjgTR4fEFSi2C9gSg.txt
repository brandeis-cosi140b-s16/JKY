Everyone at my work goes to this Cantina. It isn't bad, but it SURE isn't good. Their motto is "if the food doesn't meet your standards, lower your standards". This says a lot! I went there and the food and service takes forever, even when its dead. The crowd is the only reason why I go, but I'm not to sure why this place has a crowd. 
So...If going to the Cantina, go with people you like and expect a wait for EVERYTHING!
