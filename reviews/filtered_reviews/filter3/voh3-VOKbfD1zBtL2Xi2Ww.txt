Grabbed a quick lunch here last week. I had the chicken bowl, it was not good at all. The chicken resembled something that would be on a cheap teriyaki bowl at a fast food chain. The rice and beans were bland. The whole thing was nearly inedible if you wanted flavor. 

On the positives, service was quick and friendly. The people I dined with enjoyed their selections. I would go back to give them another try but I would definitely order something completely different. 

It's a super cute restaurant with a nice looking bar, maybe a good spot for a happy hour drink.
