This location is definitely nicer than the others but for some reason it just doesn't have that ghetto flare that the others do... I miss the one on Charleston and Decatur. The service is always OK, I always see more servers and bussers than necessary, or maybe not enough because I can never seem to get my drink, or my chips and salsa refilled in a timely manner. The food has always been pretty good, nothing super authentic but it's a sitdown mexican restaurant where you can be served in a nicer setting. When it comes to price, you have to know what you're looking for, some of the dishes are super over-priced with small portions and some are well-priced with great portions, I honestly have been kind of lost when it comes to some of their dishes and their differences other than price...
