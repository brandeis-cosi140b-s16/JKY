Came here for something to absorb all the booze we drank throughout the evening. We settled on nachos & were told by our friendly waiter that it was big enough to share. It sure was!
It really hit the spot for us and we were glad that we picked here to eat.
I would come back since the nachos were very good and the people watching was even better!
