Hmmm, it was okay I guess. Nothing wrong, but nothing outstanding either. 

The hostess was very friendly and made a few jokes on our way to the table. She asked if we wanted to sit at the high tops which feature all day happy hour on Sundays, lucky for us that it was Sunday. The happy hour deals, however, weren't much to write home about. Let's see, $5 margaritas, $2.99 tequila shots, and a few apps. You can also get a few domestic tall boys for $5 and a few imports for $6. Those seem like the best deal to me. 

For apps we had the spicy table side guac. I'm not really a fan of guac but this was pretty good, although expensive, $9 maybe. We also had the roasted peppers, I probably wouldn't order that again. The chips and salsa were good, although I would generally say that I enjoy any chips and salsa. 

I had the shredded pork tacos. They were good but nothing remarkable. GF had the shrimp fajitas. For $19.99 I thought there might be more than 5 flippin shrimp but it was good. 

For dessert we had the flan, tres leches cake and the chocolate cake. I thought the tres leches was the best and the chocolate cake was only so so. However, when dipped into the tres leches sauce, the chocolate cake was much better! 

Our waitress was decent and didn't try to rush us out of there even though we stayed at least three hours. 

With so many other options in Vegas I probably won't return to El Segundo Sol, especially with Ra right next door.
