The two and half stars that this place has is pretty much dead on. It has a lot going for it but it falls short in several areas. 

The place was excessively loud & the acoustics where we were sitting seemed to magnify the loud groups all around us.

We had specifically requested that our daughter's dinner be brought out first as it takes her longer to eat her meal; it was the last to arrive.

The guacamole was really good but the chips were not. They seemed slightly thicker & airy. The wife loved her chimichanga.  The steak burrito I ordered would have been better had they got it from Taco Bell instead of the kitchen. It had very little meat & was folded in such a way that the majority of the bulk of the burrito was from the folded tortilla. I didn't want the rice & asked that it be left off but it was on my plate when it arrived.

Our waitress was nice & helpful in pointing out the specials. But she didn't bring out our food & we had to wait several minutes after our food arrived to get silverware to eat with
