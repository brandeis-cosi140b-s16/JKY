I have been here a few times before.  By now I know I just really come for the guacamole and margaritas. Their made to order, how you like it guacamole is sooo good. It's enough for an appetizer for 4 or really good to pick at with their chips and salsa (complimentary) while drinking. My favorite margaritas are the cucumber mint which is very refreshing, or the pitaya ( cactus) tangy and a little sweet.

The food and service has fallen short for me too many times.  But I love the guacamole, drinks,  and atmosphere.  Plus there's decent people watching and it's conveniently located outside the mall.
