So I like to review places a couple times. Usually if I've had a good experience two or three times I simply allow my reviews to stand as is. Therefore I had to give Los Tacos another review based on my most recent experience.

Once again I went through the drive-thru. I will offer this information: in the drive-thru they can't see you and by that I mean you will most likely be greeted in Spanish (even if you don't know a lick of it). But no worries, I placed my order in English and there was no problem. I decided I wanted to try the carne asada taco and carnitas taco. I have heard the carne asada is superb here.

Here are the pluses: the tacos are BIG and very filling. However, I was disappointed in both of the meats. First off the carnitas were very, very fatty. I kept getting big globs of fat, not just little pieces here and there. The carne asada was better, but salty. Very salty. The salt was overpowering the natural flavor of the meat.

I've kind of had mediocre experiences at Los Tacos while my experiences at Tacos El Gordo have rated higher. Since they're both in the same parking lot I think my business is going to go to El Gordo from here on out. 

Oh, but I will give them this awesome plus: their beans are perfectly cooked and tasty and not refried beans! A very refreshing difference from the refried variety.
