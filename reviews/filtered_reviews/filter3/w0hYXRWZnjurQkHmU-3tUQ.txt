Braddah's Island Style is a 10-15 minute drive from the strip and offers chipotle style hawaiian food. It's different from the normal overpriced strip food, and what's great about this place is they offer automatic free samples to first time customers. I especially love their coconut bark, and would buy it in bulk if I lived locally. Sadly, that's where the love ends. I mean...the hand selected meat samples taste amazing, but after you order your bowl, taco, burrito, or salad, you find more fat than meat, and up goes your cholesterol. I found the bowl to be extremely oily, which is odd considering everything but the meat was exceedingly bland.
