Pretty good chow here and a great place to go for Sat and Sun breakfast particularly if you sit outside on a nice day.  It is removed from the road a bit so it is more relaxing without having all of the cars buzzing by.  They have Posole on the weekends that is pretty darn good.  If you get it with the fry bread it is even better.  They have good breakfast burritos but I find them to be of varying quality.  Sometimes I go and they are moist and flavorful and other times they are a bit dry.  When they are right they are some of the best i've had.   

I tried their Chile Relleno and the the green sauce they use with it is wonderful but portion size was a little small.  Nachos are loaded up nicely and also good.  

In regard to the style it is a "order up front" place where they will then bring food to the table.  You serve your own drinks and grab your own chips but depending on who is helping you, you may get some refills from the wait staff.  Not a place to take a date but certainly a good joint to grab some good chow with some nice flavor.
