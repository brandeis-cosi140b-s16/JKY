Came here for lunch with some work friends earlier today. The service was prompt even with the seat yourself method for lunch. I ordered the tacos plate. The food came within about 15 min which for 4 people wasn't too bad. The beans were the best thing on my dish which probably isn't the best thing considering its for tacos. The tacos were just ok nothing great and the salsa bar wasn't superb as many people said it has about 3 good salsas in my opinion at least. None of the salsas  in my opinion provided that punch i was looking for. Customer Service was awesome food just didn't match.
