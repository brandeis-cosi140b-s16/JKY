First off I prefer Mariscos Sinaloa so we will continue to go there instead.

I was a bit afraid to park my vehicle outside in this neighborhood with all the locals walking around.  The ambiance inside the restaurant was cute and enjoyable.  The server just had a flat affect.  He was neither friendly or rude.

I thought the menu prices were a bit high.  We paid the full prices for lunch on a weekend.  We got plenty of free chips and the two salsas.  I really enjoyed the green one.  We did not receive any free tostadas like other yelpers report receiving.

The portion sizes were good and I left full with some leftovers.  My son is 12 years old and tried a half order of Oysters on the half shell.  It was his first time trying oysters and he really liked them.  I ordered a bean and cheese burrito, the cheese enchiladas and quacamole to share with my two little girls.  We really enjoyed the beans, the rice (and I am not usually a fan of rice!), and the guacamole.  The enchiladas were just okay.
