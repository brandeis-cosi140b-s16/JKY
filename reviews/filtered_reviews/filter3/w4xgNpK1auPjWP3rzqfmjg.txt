We've tried New Mexican Grill twice so far.  We were attracted to the restaurant because we've been to New Mexico several times over the past few years and we love the cuisine and culture.  It's a small place, with no more than six tables.  All meals come with complementary chips and salsa, which you help yourself to.  They have three salsas--tomatillo, pico de gallo, and a spicy red salsa, each of them are good.

We've tried their carnitas tacos, red chile pork stew, huevos rancheros and chorizo, egg, and potato burrito.  The sauces have that distinctive New Mexican chile flavor, and each of them are homemade.  I really like that you can order breakfast any time of day.  Their chorizo is made from scratch, and is very lean--I loved it, it was some of the best around.  All of this comes at very reasonable prices ranging from $4 for burritos and up to $7 for their larger entrees and combos.

They haven't decided on a final menu yet, they said they plan to evaluate what people like most, which is great because they really value their customers' feedback.  

My only complaint is that while their chips are very good when they're fresh, sometimes I run into a few stale ones.  They just need to throw any old ones out when they replenish the supply.  

Lastly, it's important to mention that the folks running the joint are friendly and nice people.  They take pride in their culture as well, as their decor is distinctly New Mexican, with traditional pottery, rugs, and paintings sprinkled throughout the dining area.
