I want to give this place 4 stars, but I just can't. 

What I like: 
1. The service is always friendly and quick.
2. The food is not remarkable, but dependable and tastes pretty good.
3. It's local, and the prices are reasonable.  

What I don't really like: 
1. What is with the horribly planned foyer? If waiting indoors for a table, you either have to stand in front of the entrance, and move every 2 seconds for people entering and exiting, or stand in front of the bathroom, and move every 2 seconds... or stand near the host podium, and try to not stare at people who are already dining. We ended up waiting outside. The heat was preferable to the crowding. 
2. The booths are sunken-in but high up. I feel like Edith Ann, with my feet dangling above the ground. Not comfy! 
3. Why are some of the dishes kind of bland, like the enchiladas? They're ok but nothing to write home about. Spice it up a bit, and the surprisingly big crowd here will get bigger. 

Until then... 3 stars.
