We wanted  a meal casual enough to take our three year old too but still not on the level of say, the Circus Circus buffet.  Well, this fit the bill.

Chips and salsa were great.  Drinks were even greater!  Atmosphere was cozy and yet, kid friendly.

I had the chicken tacos plate and they were pretty good.  I thought the prices were a bit high for what we got but for Vegas, that's to be expected.  

Overall, it was a pleasant experience, but nothing super special.
