I've been here numerous times. There food is amazing and the salsas are so good. This place has a few downfalls though. Everyone that works there acts as if they are attending a funeral. The waitresses barely ever smile and everyone seems really stressed out and overworked. The seating is terrible. If they don't have room for you, they just kind of shrug and tell you to wait for a spot by the door. Not very nice at all.
