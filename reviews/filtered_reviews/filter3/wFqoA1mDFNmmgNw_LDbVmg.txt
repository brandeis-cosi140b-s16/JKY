Ok I'm not sure how to review this place because I think I made an error in my food order. I tried the Torta Del Ray as this seems to be the popular sandwich.  The positive: it was huge. Good choice if you are hungry.... And a carnivore.  The negative: huge mishmash of meats with flavors that weren't complimentary of one another. I did not understand the addition of hotdogs onto this sandwich- seems more like they are going for being eclectic rather than flavorful.  Salsa was rather bland. Our server was very attentive and friendly. Would go back for the smoothies- lots of fun, yummy non-alcoholic beverages.  Would be nice if they served alcohol too!!
