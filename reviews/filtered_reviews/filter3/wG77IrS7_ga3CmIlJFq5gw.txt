Something that has always baffled me after 15 years as a Las Vegas local is that this is the worst town to find good Mexican food.  I'm from a small town in Southeast Texas and even the franchise Mexican food in that area is amazing.  Still, I had made a plan with my father and sister to check out Bonito Michoacán, but when we got there, they had NO parking, in the front or back of the building.  So, we drove down Flamingo and found this restaurant and decided to give it a try instead.

Their food is pretty good.  Not amazing, but not horrible.  The jalapeno popper appetizer was my favorite item and it's served with a very sweet sauce that complimented it very well.  My chicken quesadilla was good, but my sister and dad both ordered the cheese enchilada meal and while they didn't hate it, they weren't impressed.  At one point, the manager came by our table to check on us and when we mentioned how we'd come by Ricardo's, she screwed up her face and told us that we didn't want to eat at Bonito Michoacán.  We asked her why and she couldn't give us a straight answer, just kept shaking her head and scrunching up her nose...that kinda irritated me.

My main complaint came when we received the check and I handed over my debit card to pay.  The waitress walked away and came back with a handheld device to swipe my card.  She then handed it to me to choose my tip of 10%, 15% or other and stood at our table while I chose.  I'm sorry, but I like to take my time on calculating a tip and I definitely didn't appreciate having to rush through it while she watched me.  Especially since the service might not have been horrible, but it also wasn't that great.  I'm still unsure if I'll ever go back or just keep trying to find a stellar Mexican food restaurant in town.
