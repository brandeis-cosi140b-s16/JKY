We stopped in around lunch time on a Saturday, New Year's Eve. My first impression of the menu was that the tacos were ridiculously expensive, $14.95 for chicken and up. The people next to us ordered the beef tacos and the serving seemed to be small, with only two tortillas. In fact, the whole menu seemed pricy, $12.95 for enchiladas? I guess we are spoiled in Texas.

We weren't that hungry so we got margaritas--$8.95--but they were very flavorful and worth it. Did not pack that much of a wallop but they were still good. We ordered appetizers only--the wife got the "tableside" guac and it was quite good, but not made tableside. I have no complaints and would get it again. We ordered medium but I think it could have more of a kick. I got the nachos and like most of the country except Texas they came as a pile of chips with stuff scattered here and there. They were good but nothing special. With chicken it came to $12 which is a lot for a pile of chips, of which I ate only half, the half with stuff on them. 

I am giving the restaurant 3.5 stars for the friendly service, the excellent margaritas, and the above average guac. The salas appears to be homemade and very tasty.
