We have a couple of favorite dishes from the Taquito Basket, mixed both beef and chicken. The bean dip is great with the Taquitos. I switch between Combo Numero Uno which has a taco, cheese enchilada and a pork tamale. My other favorite is the Burro de Casa with shredded beef. Both come with refried beans and rice. The burro is served enchilada style. Desert has been so so, but my idea of Mexican desert is a Chi-Chi's fried ice cream and no one does it the same way. Service is hard to predict, often during the lunch hours, we'll get great service, however, just yesterday we waited 15 minutes just to meet our waitress.
