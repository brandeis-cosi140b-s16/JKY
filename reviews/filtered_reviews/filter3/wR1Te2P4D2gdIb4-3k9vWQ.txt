This would normally be a 2-star review, but I appreciate the theatricality of the building and the interior decor enough to give Macayo's the extra star power.

The exterior looks like it was pulled off of the set of "Legends of the Hidden Temple" (an old Nickelodeon show), and the interior is either somewhat boring mexican restaurant (the main dining area) or guffaw-inducing dramatic lighting, tiered seating, giant wooden parrots, and a nightclub-esque glowing bar (the "Aztec" room). I overheard the waitress tell another customer that they have DJs on 2 nights a week. Makes sense.

The food is... well, it's like everyone says: cheesy, intestine-blocking, Ameri-Mexican cuisine. I almost hurled when I asked the waitress what was in their "baja" sauce. It involved some kind of cheese AND half and half. I decided to get my green chile tamale with green sauce instead. It was good, but a little sweet. The Chile Relleno was... subpar. That dish is generally a good barometer of the quality of a mexican restaurant, and theirs was soggy and drenched in melted cheese. Don't get me wrong, there's a fond place in my gut for gobs and gobs of delicious cheese, but it's not really 4-star dining.

Their drinks are... large and filled with tequila, but remain largely unoffensive.  Exactly what I expected.
