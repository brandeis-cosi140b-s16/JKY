Last Thursday we went to the new Sand Bar at Desert Ridge.  We found the last two open spots at the bar.  There was a good mix of people - both young and old as well as some left over from happy hour.  I ordered a margarita and asked if they "hand make" them or if they make them from a "mix."  The female bartender replied that she could make it either way.  So, I asked for my margarita to be hand made - non of  that mix crap.  When I tasted it - it was a margarita made from a mix.  Not very good...
However - the Sand Bar DID redeem itself when I ordered the Ahi Tacos!  Surprisingly, these by far - are some of the best fish tacos I have ever had!  Seared rare, seasoned with southwest spices, topped with fire roasted Pico de Gallo and guacamole and served on jicama tortillas!  AMAZING!  They are perfect for the hot AZ heat and hit the spot without filling you up!  I will definitely go back there for those tacos!  Also - the bartender - Brandon (I think) was awesome!  He was witty and quick to recommend the tacos and a complimenting beer.  Good crowd, good food, good music as well.  Get there early if you want a table...
