I was out running errands when I got hungry and decided to take a shot on Two Hippies Beach House. I pulled in and almost hit a crack head who walked in front of my car with two Phoenix Police Officers as witnesses to this mishap. After waiting for said crack head to skitter away, I got out of my car and approached the line. One of the officers said to me "Good brakes!" Whew! 

For my lunch, I decided on a fish burro sans cilantro and a peach lemonade. I was thankful for the cash I had in my wallet as they do not accept plastic of any form. 

I only had to wait for about 5 minutes for my food to be done and I was on my way home. I unwrapped my burro and took a huge bite. Hmm... nothing too amazing, just ok. First off. I DISLIKE when restaurants don't warm the tortilla that they make burros with and yes, this Blatina can tell the difference. Second, the burro was FULL of cabbage and not a lot of fish. The salsa was good and flavorful so I used a lot of it to flavor the burro and it brought some good spice to the burro. 

Overall it was just ok. Nothing amazing and nothing I would crave. The real winner was the peach lemonade that comes in slushy form. Yum! 

I would visit Two Hippies again to try their other offerings. The price is good, and the food is ok.
