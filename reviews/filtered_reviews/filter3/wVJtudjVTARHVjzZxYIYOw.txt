I thought the food was excellent, unfortunately the service was not.  For our business lunch, the four of us waited loooooooooooooong periods, first to order, then for the food to arrive, then even to pay our bill.  And even though the bill was a simple "divide total by four", one member of our group got exactly twice her fourth...so the total didn't add up.  More waiting.  The waitress was nice enough when we saw her, but made no effort to apologize for their foibles.

But back to the food.  The salsa was outstanding...my seafood enchiladas were suberb.  Because of the quality of the meal, I'm willing to give them another chance and hope that my first experience was just an aberration.
