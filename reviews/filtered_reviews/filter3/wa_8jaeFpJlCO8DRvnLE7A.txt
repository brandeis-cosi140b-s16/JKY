I've been fixated on finding my go-to Mexican place in the Phoenix/Scottsdale/Tempe area for a while now.  I came across this place under recommendations from people.  I've also had warnings from others not to go to this place, but I decided to disregard those warnings.

Anyway, I went to this establishment on my lunch break and ordered the Al Pastor burrito.  The meat was delicious and the other stuff that came with made the burrito very flavorful.

My only complaint--does it really have to be $6 for a thinly-wrapped burrito???  I feel ripped off.
