As a rule I don't go to sit down Mexican restaurants as there are too many good mom and pop places to go to instead.  Nevertheless, I tried Nando's because I'd tried their food at a catered event and I thought it was good.

Any way, we ordered a chimi and fajitas and a small pitcher of house margaritas.

Starting with the chips and salsa, I found both to be good.  The salsa that came in the miniature carafe war real good.  The one in the small bowl was meh.

The chimi was good and frankly a little more than I could eat.  Same with the fajitas.

The margaritas were meh.  There might have been liquor in there but I couldn't tell.  Also the mix was overly sweet so it continued to revisit me through most of the night.

The service while friendly was uneven at best.  We had to ask for things several times and it many cases what we asked for never came.

Overall I'd say the place was ok.
