What does one do when they need to grow and the neighbors are gone?  Knock down a wall and pretend nothing happened. This is what La Tolteca has done.

The menu has no real surprises. Burritos, and the other usual fair. Prices are a doallr to two above other options, but you do get a scoop of guacamole with you meal. However chips are extra.

There is a salsa bar witch also has great grilled jalapenos. Too bad you must pay for chips to make full use of it.

The food it self was nondescript the tortilla was thick, the Chile rellno lacked the richness I had had elsewhere. 

Just a note this place smells from some kind of fire grilling so you will also smell that way when you leave.
