I gave this place 3 stars because they didn't have much selection on the menu. My husband and I ordered 2 Burritos, chips and salsa, 2 sopapillas, and a drink and the total came up to $25. The "upgrades" got us. 

The burritos were pretty huge but most things on the menu were spicy. The only thing I could get my 3yr old son were unseasoned chips, (because even their regular chips have sprinkles of chili powder) and a cinnamon sugar sopapilla. I got a chicken burrito with black beans, rice and red chile sauce. They give you two options: Red or Green chile sauce. My husband got Carne Adovado Burrito (spicy pork in red sauce) and he did not like it. He didn't even finish it and he's a Burrito guy. 

So no second time for me for this place.
