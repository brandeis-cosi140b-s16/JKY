My second visit was the telling sign of when the place is busy versus the time in between lunch and dinner when I came the first time.

The place was packed but they have a lot of seats so they found us a table immediately. 

The wait staff was again very friendly and prompt. However, the waiter did misinform my son on what was in his dish so when it arrived, we had to send it back (the waiter was very apologetic). 

I liked my chili relleno and beef taco combo the first time, so ordered it again. This time, the taco fell apart as it was served on a bed of grease, so I didn't enjoy that part but the relleno was tasty. My wife had the vegetarian burrito which was "pretty good" to her.  

We also ordered queso dip with jalape√±os- I'm not a big queso fan one way or another but my wife likes it and thought it was tasty. 

Finally, I don't know what it is about ambient noise in this place but they had someone playing with the music and I guess someone on staff wanted it loud while another wanted it quieter and there was a war about it as it kept going up and down on the same song for like five minutes til the loud person won!

Overall, I think the food is good and will chalk up the other stuff to the place bring new and finding their groove. I'm not so sure if this place is as good as I thought it was after the first visit, but I think it has potential
