As with alot of the "trendy spots" in Pittsburgh, Verde needs to turn down the lights, turn up the music and cater to the young professional crowd.  Verde has a good start.  The layout is great and will be nicer with a patio in the summer.  I hope they do not intend to broadcast sports on the TVs behind the bar as it will ruin the atmosphere.  

The drink selection is fantastic and is very reasonably priced.  

The food was ok.  First, everything needed salt.  Everyone liked the fish tacos.  The chicken tacos were not a table favorite cause the meat was dark.  

I will be back.
