Beware the guacamole...

First of all let me say, this place has some pretty decent Mexican food for a good price ($10-$15/person) in Las Vegas. Pretty similar to an El Torito or Acapulco.

That being said, if you decide to go here, do not get fooled into ordering the guacamole. Our waiter came to our table and asked if we would like some chips and guacamole, to which we responded "sure"... and he left without another word.

Now... maybe I'm being unreasonable, but usually when I go to Mexican restaurants I expect the chips and salsa to be free. Since our waiter said "chips and guacamole" I figured they do guac here instead of salsa... and even if they DID charge for it, I figure they would have at least told us the price before we agreed since we didn't even open our menus yet.

Well they brought out a TINY plate of guac,, enough for 1 or 2 people to eat as an appetizer. It was really good, but to my dismay, when our check came I realized they charged us $10 for it. $10 for a tiny plate of guac is ridiculous.

Overall this place is pretty good, I would have given it a solid 4 stars if it wasn't for the guac incident.
