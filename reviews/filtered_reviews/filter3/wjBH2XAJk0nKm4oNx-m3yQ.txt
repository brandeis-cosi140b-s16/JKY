I  met up with some locals at Via Delosantos. Before going, I looked it up and read the reviews. Being a Mexican Food snob, I wanted to know what I was in for. It looked like one of those local staples.

I was unimpressed with the appearance of the restaurant when I pulled up. The inside was equally as unimpressive. I found the lively atmosphere to be fun, but it was a little hard to hear my friends at dinner. I thought the hundreds of tequila bottles to be an authentic touch. I enjoyed the margarita specials, too. My rule of thumb #1 is to always try the chicken enchiladas first (after the salsa that is.) My meal was good. The salsas were also good. I have had better, but I was not disappointed, either.

I think the service was fine but the attitude could use a little help. I agree with PP that the place could use a good cleaning, though.
