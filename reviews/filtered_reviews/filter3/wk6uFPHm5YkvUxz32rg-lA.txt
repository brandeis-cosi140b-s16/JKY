4 stars for the ambiance...eating in a dark-ish church makes you feel like you're in a repurposed building in Europe. Definitely well-done. I feel like they should host a gothic dance night here.

5 stars for chips and salsa and guacamole. VERY good!

2 to 3 stars for the rest of the food...not that memorable.

2 stars for service. We were ignored for the first 10 minutes we were there. The manager came over eventually and asked if we'd been helped. Then he found a server for us.

Expensive for what we got, we probably won't go back. But the ambiance is great...probably very good for a date.
