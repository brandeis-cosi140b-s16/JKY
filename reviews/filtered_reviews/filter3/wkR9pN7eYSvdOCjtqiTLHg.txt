There were some major hits and misses with SumoMaya. If you're going to eat here, it's really important to know what to order so that you don't end up with any disappointments. My husband and I both studied the yelp reviews and our instagram feeds to help guide us, but we still ended up with some stinkers.

What was excellent: 3 of our 4 cocktails! My husband's drink combined tamarind and rye, sort of like a manhattan. I got the green magic mojito, and the combo of coconut and mint was divine. I especially loved the whipped coconut cream on top. My second cocktail was their take on Pegu Club's amazing pisco punch. The SumoMaya version was crazy good too. For food, we loved the buttery, soft eggplant dish. Even if you think you hate eggplant, you may very well like this. Good portion for the price too. My husband said his yellowtail roll was far better than any he's had in AZ. The fish was fresh and not mushy like other places.

What was pretty good: The guacamole with togarashi was a great, albeit very expensive, starter. I might start sprinkling togarashi on my guac at home now. My husband liked salmon ceviche a lot but was yearning for kumquats in every bite. With that little tweak, it would have been excellent. Cocktail number 4, the passionfruit drink with mezcal, was decent but didn't come close to the yumminess of the others.

The misses: the summer corn. So bland. I don't know why I keep ordering this type of dish because I can make awesome Mexican corn at home. I guess I keep waiting to get surprised. The sumo green roll needed a lot of help from soy and wasabi. My husband thought it was awful. His hamachi ceviche was a let down too. Just one dimensional, not much too it.

Would we come here again? Maybe with a good set of ear plugs. The restaurant was nightclub in Vegas loud at 8pm on a Thursday night. It's just too much techno to be enjoyable.
