I really enjoyed the calamari taco and brisket taco.The salsa was way too salty :( sadly. The plate came with a choice of 2tacos rice beans and cole slaw. I got rice only and my cousin did substitute the slaw for another side she picked the butter corn which was also good. We were a party of 4 and went on a Thursday night with no wait at 8.
