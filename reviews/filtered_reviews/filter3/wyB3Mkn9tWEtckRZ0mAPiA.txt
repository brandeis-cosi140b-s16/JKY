The food here was fantastic.  I enjoyed everything I got... so why does this place lack a couple stars?

I came in yesterday (Sunday) at the halftime of the boston/miami playoff game (around 1:30pm) and ordered during  halftime.  I watched the 3rd quarter of the game before I got my food... that's about 30+ minutes (12 basketball minutes is not 12 minutes + halftime parts).  The place was not busy so why does it take so long?  When I am hungry, atleast update me or talk to me so I know that it's going to take a while.  30 minutes of hungry time also does not feel like 30 minutes... it feels like forever.

The food is as I said fantastic and it's the redeeming part for this place.  I'll likely come back because of that (second chance!), but service is worth a couple stars to me, so for that it lost both.
