It's nice and spicy with hand-hewn wood decor and interesting recipes and salsas, but after two visits I have to say it's just not all that fabulous.

The tortillas are factory, not freshly made.

The salsa bar has a lot of options, but nothing on the bar stood out as much better than anything you'd find on Baja Fresh's salsa bar.

Service was confusing and wait staff was confused. Transition from counter service to table service after the lunch hour wasn't handled well. I was seated and given a menu but no one took my order, so I ordered and paid at the counter. Then at the end of the meal, other waiters kept asking if I wanted to pay my check.

La Condesa is good enough, but I'm not impressed.
