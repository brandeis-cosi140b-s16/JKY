We were in the mood for burgers, thought we'd give 'em a try here. After all, their menu says something about them being Top 10 burgers from Phoenician Magazine or something. 

Um. No. Average burger. To the point that I almost wished that I had let my husband talk me into Whataburger. The medium rare had no pink, and the patty itself was boring. 

Their French Fries were not good either. I had 2. My husband, who is a fries whore may have had 7.

We're calorie watchers, and both felt thus was a total waste of calories. 

Do yourself a favor and stick to the southwestern style if food on the menu. That's always good and never disappointed us!
