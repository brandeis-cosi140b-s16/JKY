The restaurant wasn't bad but nothing blew me away. The fundido (steak) was good, as long as I didn't think about how many miles I'd have to run afterwards to counteract it. I'm a huge dessert fan and their deep fried ice cream was not something I'd order again (this is where they lost the most points with me). I'll probably eat there again before I make a final decision.
