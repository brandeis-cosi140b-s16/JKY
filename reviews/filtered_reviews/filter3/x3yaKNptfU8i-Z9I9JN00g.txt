The Cosmo is one of the most hip and happenin' spots on the strip.  China Poblano is a great place to eat and share interesting fusion dishes before continuing on with the night.  The service is snarky, prices are high for what you get, and the ambiance is pretty loud but hey, It's Vegas.  It's fast and easy and...well...HIP!
