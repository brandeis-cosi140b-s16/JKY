This restaurant is getting a 3 from me because it has 5-star qualities and 1-star qualities.

The good: Food is fantastic. The street tacos are very good and quite authentic. The Chiliquiles were delicious and cooked just right. The restaurant has a good ambiance, although a bit loud, and their patio is great to sit at.

The bad: SERVICE!!! (they have none). Apparently, my group was not hipster enough, so our waiter paid us no attention. It took 3 requests and over 10 minutes to get some straws for our drinks. Coincidentally, our neighboring table was having a similar issue, as they had waited so long for their beers (which were sitting on the bar, already having been poured) that they arrived warm.

If you go here, just make sure you aren't on a timetable.
