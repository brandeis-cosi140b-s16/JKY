We went to this place because we were looking for somewhere near downtown Tempe. When we entered this place, it was like private mom/pop shop with young workers. We ordered some large burrito and Quesadia. They were all right for the price! Also, I was surprised to see $2,00 beer per bottle special, which I have seen so many times when I passed by this store. I believe this is their sales tactic. The food here is normal and price are good in general. I would revisit here again, but also order some good margarita or beer which goes well with those meal.
