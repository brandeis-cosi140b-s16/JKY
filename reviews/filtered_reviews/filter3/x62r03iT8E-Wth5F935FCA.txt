I am a fan of this place, but on our last visit was very disappointed. 

Went for my daughters birthday, called ahead to let them know and then told the staff when we arrived. 
We have been there for many birthdays and love how they put the sombrero on the "birthday person" and sing.... 
Didn't happen... instead our bill came immediately after the last bite. 

As for the food, I had the Ensalada Marinera which is always good, however tonight the avocado wasn't ripe. 
My husband enjoyed the steak salad... and the girls enjoyed their burrito and taquitos. 
The margaritas were good, however we had asked for no salt, and yes they had salt on the rim. 

I'll go back, because overall it is a fun restaurant with good food.
