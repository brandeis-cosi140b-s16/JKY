We used to go here years ago. Been going to ajo als and Arriba's since. They are just closer to where we live.
I ordered the pollo fundido, which is what I order at the other places. It was drier and not as tasty as I've gotten used to. Still a good dish but it'll probably be years before I go back again.
The service was awesome. The guy who brings the chips and salsa and refills the drinks- totally awesome. My drink was never below 1/2- I love that. We tipped him separate...
