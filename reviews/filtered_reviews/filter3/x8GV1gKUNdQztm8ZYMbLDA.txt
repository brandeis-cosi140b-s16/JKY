I usually don't make my way down Atwood to Mad Mex, considering just how many yummy eateries are right up the street (Las Palmas! Bangal Kebab!). Luckily, Mad Mex has a tendency to offer up some pretty convincing deals every once in a while.

If you sign up for their birthday club, you get a coupon for a free burrito you can use around your birthday, and/or if you're a student, you get half off food Monday-Thursday from 2-4 PM. There are also many more deals listed on their website... seriously, saving money here requires only minimal planning.

I went with a friend around 2 PM for the student deal. We split some guac and chips, he got the fish tacos (not covered in the deal), and I got the thai curry burrito.

FOOD: 
+ I like the guac here better than at Steel Cactus, which I visited recently. You get salsa in addition to the guac, and the chips are also thicker and have some flavor on their own. Could be personal preference!
+ My burrito was delicious, and the sauce was creamy and tasty.
+ My friend enjoyed his fish tacos too, and I kind of ate them with my eyes.

SERVICE: our server was really nice, but she wasn't around our table that much. Small mistakes here and there, like I asked to get my burrito as a Bare-ito (like a bowl), but it came out with a normal wrap anyway. Also, the appetizer wasn't discounted like it should have been when our bill came, but she quickly corrected it once we let her know.

ATMOSPHERE: it wasn't a super busy time to go, so the place definitely wasn't as loud as some other reviews say. Still had a little bit of trouble talking over the music though. It seems like a good place for small meetups with friends. 

Not dying to go back anytime soon, but I think it's still a decent option for this kind of food in the area! Three and a half stars for me. :)
