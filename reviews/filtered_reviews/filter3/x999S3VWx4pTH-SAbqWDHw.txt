Came at Lunch time, place was mildly busy. forgot that i have been here before and didn't care to much for the place. ordered a burger and fries, service was swift and friendly. Burger was good! would have probably enjoyed a different one better just because of what i like on burgers. i ordered the specialty Burger called the Country Fried Burger. it was good, but it didn't fill me up, there was two small patty's on it, tomato, lettuce and onion strings. definitely yummy, but not the best I've ever had. Fries were perfect. Place was rather bland in decor, kind of clean... but i'm here for the food! so i don't care. nice little hole in the wall place with lots of good reviews, see if it's right for you:)
