Shrimp taco is my favorite here. Everything else is ok =\ The Carnitas Tacos pulled pork or chucks was a little bit on the dry side. The Quesadilla Canre Asada Sirloin Streak was just ok. I think at Applebee's it taste better =x  Also it gets pretty load in there so it was kind of hard to chat. Maybe we went on a busy night so whatever.
