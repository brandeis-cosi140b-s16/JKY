Pretty good dining.  I ordered a Taco Platter - 2 carne asada tacos and 1 fish taco.  I thought the fish in the fish taco had waaay too much breading.  The rest of the food items were typical of any large chain Mexican restaurant.  Lots of food, chips, salsa, which could have been spicier/hotter - was tame enough for small children, but I think adults prefer more kick.  Service was fast and very friendly.
