I was in the area for labor day weekend and of course, not being familiar with the area and where to eat. I took out my handy dandy yelp app on my phone to look for a place to eat that got good ratings. Well, I found this place on yelp and reading some of the reviews and the fact the Guy Fiery from food network came here was enough for me to give it a try. It was an exit away from the Arizona Grand Resort where we were staying. 

My family and I order the popular 3 taquitos meal but don't be confused and think that these are the crunchy rolled fried "taquitos", no.  they're mini tacos and we also ordered the chile relleno. 

The taquitos were ok, nothing spectacular and it came with a side of beans and rice which were luke warm and not the satisfying warm/hot home cooked beans and rice.

The chile relleno were definitely very good and should probably be the more "popular" item. The filling was nice and cheesy with potato and the sauce had a lot of flavor. Worth ordering!

Not sure what the hype is about but I did like the restaurant wall artwork.
