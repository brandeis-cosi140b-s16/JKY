My husband and I come here for dinner every so often.  Being creatures of habit (some say boring, I say hey, I know what I like!) we always order the same thing.  I get chicken fajitas, he gets pollo fundido.  Now, you would think that we would plan this out and come on Thursday nights when it's $11.95 fajita and fundido night, right?  Wrong.  I have no idea why but we totally suck at planning to go on Thursdays.

If you get there during normal dinner time you're going to have trouble parking and you're gonna have to wait to get a table.  Tuesday and Wednesday nights are nutty - senior night and family night (kids eat free I think).  

Service is usually on the slow side whether the restaurant is busy or not.  My husband loves their chips and salsa.  I personally don't like them all that much because the chips are paper thin and they always seem to be greasy when we're there.  The chicken in the fajitas is always good - very flavorful.  I would like it better if there was more chicken, less onions but such is life.  My husband loves the fundido.  He always looks for something like it on other Mexican restaurant menus but has never found anything he likes better than Valle Luna's fundido.  Their rice and beans have excellent flavor.

Overall the food is pretty decent, the service is slow, the parking lot sucks, and good luck getting someone to refill your water glass!
