This place looks like a brokendown shanty shack on the border. It hasnt been dusted in years and it took a few minutes between being seated and seeing our waiter.

That being said, the food was amazing! I would give 5 stars on food for sure. The prices are what youd expect on the strip but they have a few inexpensive options, specifically breakfast. I had the chicken enchiladas and was blown away by the flavor.

Please for the love of the gods clean your decorations. I know you are going for the cobbled together look but it looks like you take no pride in your place. Dusting would have given you 5 stars.
