Let me start with...  if your a big eater your not going to be happy. You might be better served to go get a Whopper @ the Burger King in the same parking lot. If you like the burger to be thick and juicy... not going to find it here. 

Now if you want a flavor party this is a different story. The beach house burger has mega flavor. The green chili sends it to the next level.  

The Texas burger claims to be bbq...no bbq sauce. Good but what I had envisioned came up short.  Also, it was supposed to have a creamy coleslaw...I think that the chef waved the spoon over the burger and we might have gotten a few pieces of the cabbage and dressing. 

The seasoned french fries were good. A hint of sugar in the seasoning. 

The sweet potatoe tots are ok.  

Overall a little pricey for what you get.  

Cool tunes playing.  Friendly staff. 

I would like to say I would travel to come back, but sadly mo.
