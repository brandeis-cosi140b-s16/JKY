We went here for some drinks before we went out for night. We grabbed some "small bites" along with our sangria. Sangria was greaaaaat, small bites wellllllllll kinda were lame. My boyfriends literally came  in what looked like a popcorn cone you get at the local fair. 

Overall the drinks are great and so is the vibe in the place. Maybe just somewhere for a quick happy hour. 

They did have a margarita popsicle that I really wanted to get, but forgot because I was so into their sangria. Next time!!
