This place is good, but I think I just ordered the wrong thing. The Hibiscus Enchiladas were just way too sweet for me. I think they should be on the dessert menu and not dinner menu. I'd like to give it another chance and order something else next time, but other than that a good vibe. Seemed like the typical American Mexican restaurant.
