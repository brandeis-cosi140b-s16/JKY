It was a lot easier to get a seat, grab a taco and leave back when Cabo was a place where mainly those of an artistic bent hung out.  Suddenly Fat City was torn down, more restaurants moved in and NoDa became an acceptable place for the crowd that never left Uptown before that point.  Enter hour-long waits to get food and a slight decline in the quality of the food.  But we all must move forward....

Cabo has finally torn down the wall and expanded their restaurant!  Hopefully this will continue to alleviate the wait time and it won't be such a pain in the ass to eat here.  I'm a big fan of the corn salsa and nepalitos salad.  I typically stick with the blackened mahi tacos since the fish on their taco specials is not really as exciting as it used to be.  Service is often quite good, but there are days where it can be piss poor, too.  Overall I'm happy with service, though.  

I don't go to Cabo because they make the best tacos I've ever had or because they have an extensive beer menu.  I go to Cabo to eat an above average taco, drink some cheap Mexican beer (probably from a can AND with an unnecessary piece of citrus fruit) and enjoy a sunny day outside while sitting inside.  I also like to stare at Will Puckett's art and wish that I actually had the talent to paint.
