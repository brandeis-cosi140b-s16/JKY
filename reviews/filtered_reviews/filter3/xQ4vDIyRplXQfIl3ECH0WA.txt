I love their chips and salsa.
I used to really like their food. I pretty much always get the same thing...Crispy Chicken taco and Chicken Flautas combo with black beans. Well I think they changed their recipes...the black beans were still good but were very soupy and the flautas were very bland, the taco was okay. The corn cake you get with your entree is still delish. My husband got a 3 course combo, the soup was bland...we kept adding hot sauce. I didn't taste his meal, he said it was okay but was missing spices. His combo came with a dessert, we got the fried ice cream...it was small and just mehh. 
Staff is always great. They occasionally forget something we ordered but they make up for it.  I'll def go back for my beloved chips and salsa...another meal is still in the cards. Stay tuned...
