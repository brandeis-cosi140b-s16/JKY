My family and i decided to try this place based on the rave reviews here on yelp. We fed a family of 4 for less than $40. That's the only real plus is the price. They do give you a lot of food too. The taste however was nothing to write home about.

I had the spicy pork and beef bulgogi with rice. Although it was sorta good it tasted sorta dry. My wife had their beef fusion burrito and said it was the best she ever had. 

This is a good family place because a lot of adults brought their kids there and they were just running around. For the first time ever I told my kids if they want to play around at a restaurant they can. If you're the type of person that likes nice quiet romantic settings don't go here. It's a family (with kids) restaurant.

3 things that bother me:
(1) when you walk in, even though you can sit immediately at a table because it's a really small place, they have a stupid sign asking you to wait to be seated. I'm sorry but the atmosphere of this place doesn't scream high class si why are you pretending to be high class by making us wait???

(2) They don't have fountain drinks. You have to order canned or bottled drinks and they charge a lot for them. Whatever savings you have from the food will be made up for with the cost of drinks. And it's not like you can get a free refill on drinks when they are canned/bottled

(3) The best and most surprising thing about this place is that they make their own homemade nachos and they taste great. You'll instantly want more but they only brought 1 little small basket for all 4 of us to share. The basket is so small you'd think they should bring 1 for each person or at least give us a much bigger bowl of chips (enough to feed 4)

With all that being said I would recommend someone to try this place but if you have to drive more than 10 mins to get to it then it's not really worth it. We drove all the way from Henderson so it was like a 20-30 minute drive and I didn't think it was worth that.
