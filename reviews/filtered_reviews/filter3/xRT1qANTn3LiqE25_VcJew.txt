The food was great and the service was good. We tried a little of everything, but the highlights were the Shrimp Mojo (recommended by our waiter, and definitely one of our favorite dishes of the night), Dancing Eggplant (we thought an eggplant dish would be boring, but it was out of this world), and the Lucky 6 Sui Mai. Other highlights were the guacamole and the tuna ceviche (both pretty unoriginal in terms of concept, but when prepared as perfectly as they were, you take notice). This restaurant does get expensive, especially for alcohol -- that accounted for half of our bill. I would recommend eating here, but drinking elsewhere.
