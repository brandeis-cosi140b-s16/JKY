Total tourist joint, but the Groupon made me give it a go.

Let me just say that if the service weren't so horrible, this place would probably be a four of five star. My waitress took 20 minutes to bring me water after I requested it.

The food:

They have the best salsa I've had in a long time. Not too spicy and amazing flavor. I could eat it plain. I also ordered Cadillac Nachos which chicken. Amazing! Not a lot of chicken, but great flavor. Contender for the best nachos I've ever had.

The liquor:

I think I ordered a Daiquiri. I don't drink a lot. I will say that they aren't stingy with the alcohol. I could liquor overpowered the drink. My mom loved it. Me, not so much. If you like you drink, you'll be okay with it.

I would come back to this place. Hopefully I'd have a different server.
