I was brought here by a local who had never been here, but was told this place had great, authentic food. Unfortunately, the majority of the menu consists of the same old Americanized-Mexican food that you will find at most Mexican places. There are a couple of standouts - the salsa verde chili Colorado was pretty good. The bowl of chili app was pretty good as well. Tequila selection is extensive. Overall, nothing really to rave about. A solid meal, at a decent price. Service was fast and friendly. I'd visit again.
