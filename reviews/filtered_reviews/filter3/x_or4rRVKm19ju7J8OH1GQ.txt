Mexteca, while not known for their breakfast menu, has quite the selection of breakfast burritos and other breakfast items including pancakes with eggs and bacon. I opted to go with the pancakes meal, having had a breakfast burrito the day before. I was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. The eggs were delicious and the bacon was even better. The pancakes themselves were okay hence the three star rating.

The staff was friendly and the dining area was clean and well maintained. I would definitely recommend Mexteca, but I would suggest sticking with the breakfast burritos in the morning. 

Enjoy!
