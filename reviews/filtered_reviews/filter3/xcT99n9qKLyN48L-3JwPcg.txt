Chipotle is Chipotle... all delicious. This particular location is "a-okay." Everyone else is right, they are kind of stingy with their portions. Luckily I took note of this and was sure to ask for extra everything. I think they got the point that I was hungry. 

The food was not abnormal for a Chipotle. Same quality that I've grown to expect. The employees were all friendly, for the most part. I didn't experience any issues with my order - I mean, how could you? You pick everything out as you go. 

So! In conclusion, be sure to ask for extra of all of your "fixings"...everything but extra meat (or guac) is at no extra cost to you. Also, don't show up smack dab in the middle of lunch or dinner times because this place gets slammed. Or do... if you want to wait, no bother to me. :)
