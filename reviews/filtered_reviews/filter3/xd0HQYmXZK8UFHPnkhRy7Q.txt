This bar is like no other bar in the Chandler area.  This is where you go on a Friday or Saturday night if you are into the party scene. The Sandbar has a strong beach theme; there is even a small pool with sand you can go in. It definitely emits a fun atmosphere.  However, this place lacks quality service.  My friends and I had several servers throughout the night and they all seemed pretty inadequate at their jobs.   Two drink orders were completely messed up and my husband's meal was supposed to come with chips and salsa, which was clearly stated on the menu, but the server insisted that it did not.  I watched our waitress spill almost every drink she walked past with.  I can tell they were all working hard, but they were just horrible at their jobs. On the bright side, the food was very good and the blueberry margarita was amazing!
