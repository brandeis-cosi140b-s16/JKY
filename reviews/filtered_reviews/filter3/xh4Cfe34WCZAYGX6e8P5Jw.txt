I've been here twice and both times the food has been great! I would say that the carne adobada is definitely my favorite.  The first time I went for breakfast and the food was great, parking was easy to find and our server was incredibly friendly, however, this was not the case the second time I went. The second time, I had to use the valet parking as their lot is pretty small, as mentioned by others.  The service was horrible and the waiter was incredibly rude.  Even though the food was great that time, the server had a way of ruining the experience for us and it makes me think twice about going back.  Upon leaving I had to wait 10 minutes for the valet guy to bring my car around as he was out of sight and no one seemed to know where he was.
