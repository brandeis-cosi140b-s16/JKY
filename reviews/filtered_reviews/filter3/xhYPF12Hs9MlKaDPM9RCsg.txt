So a few weeks back during my visit to Glendale/Phoenix area, a friend and i tried this place out once the Dave & Busters closed for the night, the place is okay, figured we tried it out since the place across the street looked way to crowded.

The crowd was a typical college crowd and i would say a few regulars, since i am not from the area, but you know the type that seem like a bar fly and they know everybody by name, or know the bartenders.

Got there around midnight and stayed until last call, they do not rush you out at all, just act right i guess. I had a few rounds of Dos XX, i did not tried their food at all, maybe next time i get the chance to step in there i will if time permits.

I do like the mix of music they play, older jams as well as new one's, so if you find yourself in the Tempe Marketplace, stop in and have a drink or two and dance a bit, you might stick around longing and enjoy yourself, i know i did.

Enjoy.
