Liked the artsy decor and slightly unusual taco selections.  Would have preferred 3 rather than 2 tacos in the combos.  I had the Cabo shrimp and the conchita pilbil tacos.  Both very good but neither knocked my socks off.   The various salsa were indentified by signs while I was there and lots of fun to test against my tacos (even though I ended up preferring the most standard versions).  The strawberry salsa is a definite must - astounding to get strawberry taste and heat at the same time and it works!
