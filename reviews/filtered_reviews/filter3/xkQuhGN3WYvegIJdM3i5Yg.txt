The food here is really good.  It's a bit high priced for what it is and the service has been crazy slow but if you're not in a hurry and price isn't much of a concern, it's definitely worth the trip.  They have some specials that seem like a decent deal, though I have yet to try any.  The food can be spicy, which is probably what saves this from getting only 2 stars from me because I like spicy food.
