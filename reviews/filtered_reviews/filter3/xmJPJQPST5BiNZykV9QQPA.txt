I think Steel Cactus is a little underrated here on Yelp. No, it's not perfection and it's definitely not real Mexican. To be fair, I only ever come here for lunch or weekday dinner when it's not filled with drunk Shadyside girls and the "yinzerita" crowd (ew). I really like their tofu tacos but they definitely need extra hot sauce poured on for flavor. They give you options between REALLY American ("gringo style") and Mexican-ish American. They have fantastic drink specials, especially the $2 mimosas on Sunday (however, why on earth does brunch only happen until 1pm?). Prices are lower than Mad Mex and portion sizes are more friendly to non over-eaters. 

Space is huge, including a rooftop deck, and I've never had real problems with the service. Ultimately, Steel Cactus is the kind of place with something for almost everyone, and a good place to bring parents.
