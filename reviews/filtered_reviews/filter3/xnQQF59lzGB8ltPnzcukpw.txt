Well...I wanted to fall in love with this place but I didn't. It was just okay for me. The young girl at the counter was super friendly, no question, and our meal came out pretty quickly. I knew going in that the dinnerware would be styrofoam with plastic utensils, but it's seems so wasteful. The place was busy on a Saturday night, so it seems popular enough. 

I had a cheese enchilada and a green corn tamale with rice and beans. Everything was just fine. The chips came in a plastic bag...very hard, over salted and cold. When I can find warm, freshly made chips, salsa and guacamole at my local sports bar, why would I make the drive here?

There were used napkins on the floor, no clean tables and both the drink and salsa station showed evidence of heavy use. Kind of off-putting, really. 

Our family of four ate for $40. I can make a mean Mexican meal at home for far less than that. We have lived in the Phoenix area for over four years and we have not yet found a Mex place we love.
