Curious to try this place as I saw them working on it for weeks.  Walked up on a Saturday morning around 11... greeted by the sound of... is that Bret Michaels singing "every rose has it's thorn?" on the loudspeakers.  Took away from the "street food cred" immediately for me.  Walking in you see a nice display of baked sweets in a glass display case.   Mine was a little dry but nice.  Service was extremely prompt and friendly throughout the experience, if even a little over eager?  As I waited for my meal, I looked at the black and white pictures of old school Mexican street eats, and Bret Michaels turned into Journey, then REO Speedwagon, only to be topped by Peter Cetera and Cindy Lauper.  Not sure what Mexican street these guys played on.  My lunch came on house baked bread which was very nice, potato chips were homemade and excellent.  Salsa bar has limes and cool cucumbers which contrasted nicely with the appropriate heat in my Torta Huevo con Chorizo.  I sat at 2 tables and all chairs, most tables and corners of floors were covered in crumbs.  I was the only one in the restaurant.  The first table was cleaned off quickly for me.  I am mixed on this place.  The ambiance was disappointing but the food was very good.  I guess... wait for it... every rose has its thorn?  Barump.
