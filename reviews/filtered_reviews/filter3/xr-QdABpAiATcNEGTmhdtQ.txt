The guacamole was perfect, the spiciest had a good kick, and the sprinkling of queso fresco (or a similar cheese maybe?) was a nice touch. The tinga taco was tasty, and I really enjoyed the traditional shumai plate, a great sampler of the different varieties.  I had bites of my friends plates, and their food ranged from meh to pretty good.  However, I was expecting a unique and exciting experience from a Jose Andres restaurant, and was very underwhelmed by the experience in general.  This was definitely a one-time visit for me.
