I don't have much to write about this place, but I enjoyed my lunch here. 
There are several choices on the menu however, after seeing shark tacos, I knew that is what I wanted. (I've eaten shark before, but never in a taco)
It was good! It was served with black beans, rice and guacamole. 

The margarita I ordered was good also.
