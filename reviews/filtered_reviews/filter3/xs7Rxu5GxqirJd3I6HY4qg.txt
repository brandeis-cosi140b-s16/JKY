I really like Cabo for the atmosphere, menu, beers.  The food is just A-OK it's pretty consistent and you can get some very good tacos but as far as food network worthy mmm not so much.  I will continue to come back to this little joint though waiting for it to wow me.  This is a great place to take some friends for lunch and try out some unique fish tacos.  It's always bumping so be prepared for a wait.
