I like Z-Tejas, but I just can't get past the just average seafood enchiladas.  It's short on taste, short on seafood, and big on spinach and other filler. See Barrio and Tradiciones for kick ass seafood enchiladas.

The decor is very upscale chainy, but I dig the AZ, NM, TX flags...it's a nice display even though it is designed to remind you you're at a Southwestern place.  Subtlety, everyone, subtlety.

Since then I've ordered differently.  You can't go wrong with their chicken avocado sandwich.  But I do have top say, I get excited thinking about the queso, cornbread and the catfish beignet.  I don't know what they do to the catfish or the beignet crustorama, but it makes me giddy come time for each Z-Tejas visit.  As for the cornbread, I'll second Max's comment about it.  

I can't speak to the margaritas though....since I'm usually there for business lunches or business dinners.  Hiccup, um what was that, boss?
