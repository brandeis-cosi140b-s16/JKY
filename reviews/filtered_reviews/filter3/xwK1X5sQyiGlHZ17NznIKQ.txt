My girlfriend and I met my dad here for a little Cinco de Mayo treat while we were visiting for the week. 

We had Gustavo as a server....he was pretty bad. He was either overwhelmed or distracted b/c he only checked on us a few times, and we ended up drinking somewhere else b/c of how bad he was. We were ready to spend a bunch of money on margaritas, but his service left us w/ a bad taste in our mouth. 

The hostess...on the other hand (not sure what her name was, but she had dark hair & was pretty cute) did a GREAT job. She was very welcoming, professional, and friendly. Plus, anytime were called her over (which was a few times) she took care of us immediately  with drinks, water, etc. 

Food was pretty good. They make the guac in front of you (I'm always a fan of that). My dad got enchiladas (not sure which ones). He said they were just okay. He mentioned a few times that the enchiladas and the black beans were missing something. My GF and I had some tacos. I had the Shrimp ones (Shrimp Baja  perhaps?), and they were pretty good. The shrimp was a different flavor than I had expected, but different in a good way!

The location wasn't bad, and the "ambiance" was pretty good. It was a little on the darker side (not like Darth Vader dark, but with minimal lighting LOL).

I know it is Vegas, and every drink is $15+, but I would have appreciated a bigger margarita glass. The ones we were served was not impressive for the amount. Overall, the flavors for the margs were pretty damn good.
