The food here is great! The carne asada fries are amazing and just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Sooo why the 3 stars? The process to order here is not practical for the customer. There are diffrent lines based on what kind if tacos you want. If you want carne asada AND al pastor tacos u may have to get in line again because each line is specific for the meat. The lines are also fairly long no matter what time I've gone here (2 am or 5pm).
