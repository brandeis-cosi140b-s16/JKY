I think Blue Adobe deserves 3.5 stars.  Its good, but not great...and not quite up to 4 star status.  We go back primarily because of consistency & proximity.  Right now, I enjoy their salmon salad.  Its a decent piece of salmon on a large salad with tons of toppings.  My boyfriend usually gets the halibut tacos.  Also, they have this great (crazy cheesy) bean dip to order as an appetizer.  The margaritas are a bit watery, at least for my tasting.  They don't skimp on the chips and salsa, though I have had people come with us who didn't enjoy the salsa flavor!
