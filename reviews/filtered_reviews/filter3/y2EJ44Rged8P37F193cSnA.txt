Let me say first off, my girlfriend and I go here probably once a week.  Why 3 stars then?  

Lately their service has been slow and they haven't been able to get how we order our food.  it's not rocket science really.   They have a two rolled taco plate that we get all the time.  Lately we've been cutting our portions so we'll order a la cart.  One rolled taco with rice and beans.  We then ask them to put them in the oven so the cheese is melted (like the normal menu item).  

What do they do?  They end up putting both on one plate with one serving of rice and beans.  When we explain to them that's not how we wanted it (twice now), they bring back two full servings to both of us with two rolled tacos each..    So we eat one and then there's wasted food.

Again, we love the food.  Delicious.. but something working these last few times.
