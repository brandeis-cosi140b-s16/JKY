Dinner after shopping for a bday gift.  We had, rather I had an easier time deciding on something here.  
My company was great so it made waiting for the server to stop by to simply take a drink order a little easier.  We waited about 15 minutes for a first approach and I only know that because of the time Happy Hour ended.  
The food was yummy and certainly made me glad we stopped in here cuz it's been years since we've dined at a Carlos O'Brien's.  Salsa, guac, the Asada -all very good.  
Would have given a higher rating but service was just slacking.  Server had two tables and then blamed the bartender for being slow.
