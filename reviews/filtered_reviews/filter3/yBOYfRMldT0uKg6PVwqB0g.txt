Started off with the guava coconut drink, $13 is a bit much but it was yummy. Chips, corn queso, and guac were a great appetizer. For tacos I got the pineapple pork in a crispy shell which was my favorite. I also got the shrimp taco which was pretty good. The addition of all the different sauces adds unique flavor and fun to your meal. I was however, disappointed in the churro sundae. It was basically frozen yogurt with Carmel sauce and small, chewy sticks covered in cinnamon. I was craving a doughy churro but this wasn't it. Overall, cute outdoor indoor patio and I would return and try more tacos and other drinks.
