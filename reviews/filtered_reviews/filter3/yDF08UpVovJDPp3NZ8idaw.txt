My husband and I are looking for a restaurant that serves very spicy Mexican food... Thought this would be it but it wasn't. The food was good. It did remind me of New Mexico Mexican food. They had sopapillas which I've never been able to find in vegas. Tamales were good. But the sopapillas alone is what I'll be going back for. Just wish the chili was really spicy like it is in NM. And yes, I did try the XXX chili... Weak!
