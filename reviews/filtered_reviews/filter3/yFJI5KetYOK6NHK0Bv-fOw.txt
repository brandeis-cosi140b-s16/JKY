A laid back beach vibe, huge patio and more than enough TVs makes Sandbar more of a great happy hour spot.  My friends and I have always referred to it as the Dos Gringos for "grownups."  More of an upper 20's & 30's crowd.  If you're looking to get a great deal on your meal during other times, there's a $30 for $15 deal on local dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485).

This sums up my last trip:
Chips, salsa and guacamole = Awesome.  Super Fresh.  This wasn't some out of can/bag and thrown on the plate app.  The massive portion and freshness justifies the price.

Rest of our meal (Ahi Tacos and Ancho Chili Mahi Tacos) = Good, but nothing to write home about.

Service = Spotty.  It took forever to get our drink orders.  When my beer and my girlfriend's diet coke arrived we ordered the appetizer.  When the waitress came by a few moments later to tell us the order would be out in a few minutes, we went ahead and ordered or meals.  Again, it felt like a long time before the chips and guacamole were brought to the table.  But our meals arrived only moments after we received our appetizer.  Although our server was really nice (or maybe I just thought she was since she was cute).
