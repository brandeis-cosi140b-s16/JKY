My wife and I went with her parents for lunch the other day, and we both had an identical experience, which was, "This is tasty, but it's definitely not what I ordered."

She sent her tacos back and got them replaced and they were fine.  I ordered the huevos ahogados and got huevos rancheros, which is puzzling, because the waiter actually came back to ask me to clarify what I wanted, and it said huevos ahogados on the ticket, but something happened somewhere that resulted in my being unable to acquire the desired drowned eggs.  I was planning on ordering the huevos rancheros the next time anyway, so I'll just flip-flop the sequence, but 50% of our table had a mistake in their order, and I wish it hadn't been the case.

Other pros: good chips, very good salsa, pretty reasonable prices for upscale-ish lunch plates.

Cons: service was slow/inattentive, mistakes in our orders

I'll give this another try, and there's potentially another star in it for these guys if future experiences are better.
