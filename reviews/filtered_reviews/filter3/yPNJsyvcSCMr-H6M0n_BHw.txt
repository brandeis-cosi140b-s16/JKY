The tacos were delicious but I found that for the price it wasn't worth it. I spent around 11.50 and it was for two tacos and a drink. Don't get me wrong It was loaded with meat and toppings but going in with the mindset that it was around the same pricing area of tacos el gordo I was sadly mistaken. All in all a good taco place.
