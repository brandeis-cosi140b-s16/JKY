Atmosphere was really cool - almost felt like we were in Mexico! They were very very busy and our server was nice. 
The portions are kind of on the small side. Hubby got the huevos rancheros (smallest I have ever seen) and I got the breakfast burrito. There wasn't  a lot of flavor to either of them so  we added some hot sauce, and ordered Guac and salsa. The Guac didn't have much flavor either but the salsa was great. 

They also gave us a free house  margarita because we unlocked it on yelp but it was warm!! Blah!
