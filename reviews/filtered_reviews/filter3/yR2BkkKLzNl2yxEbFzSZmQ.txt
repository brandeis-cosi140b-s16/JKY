Overpriced, probably won't be coming back or suggest to other people.   Limited vegetarian options.    The flaming coffee looks like a cool experience, but we don't know how it actually tastes.   

When it came down to it, the only reason that we ate here is because it was at the hotel that we were at.

Some of the other reviewers say that the guacamole was the best they've ever had.   That's crazy to me, they must not have had that much guacamole in their lives.... I feel like I've actually guacamole at home that tastes better.  And for $15, their guacamole better be great.
