Viva Mexican Food in Vegas?  This little joint a few miles off the Strip is worthy of consideration.   Two standouts here are the chile relleno and fideo soup, which my buddy Dan says is tough to find in many LA Mexican eateries.  However, the rest of the menu is about as exciting as a trip to El Torito.  Decent food and good service for the price.
