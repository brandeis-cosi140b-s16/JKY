Came here with a groupon. Walking in I was greeted with a sample of a couple different meats. I was then showed the menu board and explained the steps of ordering. I ordered a burrito made with a flour tortilla with pulehu steak, cheese, jalapenos and spicy tomato with grilled maui onion. The tomato/onion salsa wasn't spicy but tasted good. I thought the steak was flavorful and the whole burrito to be good but the size was too small for me. I also ordered a cheese quesadilla that was good but average. I could see myself coming back here with coupons if ever offered. My wife enjoyed her food a bit more than me especially their coconut bark (I'm not a fan of coconut I didn't try it).The people inside were friendly and it was clean.
