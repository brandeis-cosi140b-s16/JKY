I was intrigued by the cool looking architecture of the restaurant, and decided to give it a shot, since I enjoyed the meal at the Tempe Macayo's. Because Central is under construction, it was a bitch to get to, but once I made it, there was ample parking (probably because nobody wanted to brave the construction). I had a green chili burrito and a carne asada taco combo, which came with rice and beans. The chips are good quality, and excellent salsa. Not too runny, not too chunky. Kinda like Goldilocks....
I had a couple reasonably priced Nergo Modelo's during dinner. The Taco was the best part of the meal. Hard shell and fresh, ample amount of cheese, tomato, and lettuce piled up on top. 
The atmosphere is your typical Mexican Cantina, with festive colors of green and red and yellow. I'd definitely give it another go-around, but probably swing by the Tempe location.
