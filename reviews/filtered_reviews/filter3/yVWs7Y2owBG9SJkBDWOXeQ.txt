I had lunch here today.  Tamales were very good.  Food overall was good, but not great (but not bad either).  My wife has an avocado allergy and the menu did not disclose that the tacos came with guacamole on them so it would be nice if the menu were clearer.

There are over two dozen well priced combos, breakfast items, and a full bar.  I'd go back.  It was good.
