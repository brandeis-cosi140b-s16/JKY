Went here once to try it out and it was certainly interesting. They have $4 margaritas which were pretty decent and very yummy tacos. I also tried the sonoran dog which was very tasty. Overall a nice experience but the food was pretty $$. Tacos are around $3-5 each. You do pay for quality however, just not so much quantity.
