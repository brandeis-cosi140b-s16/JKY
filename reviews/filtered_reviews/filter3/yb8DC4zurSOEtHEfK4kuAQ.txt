Valle Luna isn't the best, most authentic Mexican food in the land, but it's plenty good enough for those that don't know any better. I've only visited for happy hour, but always leave with a happy tummy after chowing down on spicy chips and salsa, margaritas,and half-priced appetizers.

I'm particularly fond of this location because of the sweet lakeside view. Its beauty at sunset combined with the savings from coupons they repeatedly send in the mail are reason enough to return for more.

HH is 3-7:30 M-F and 12-6 on Sat. Cheers!
