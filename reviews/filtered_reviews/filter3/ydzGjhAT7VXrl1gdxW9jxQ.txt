Came here for a Saturday dinner, the place was pretty big and pretty busy. Contemporary decor and very nice staff! Here's a bit of recap of what we had:

~Chips & Salsa - 3 stars - decent and limitless!
~Crab & Shrimp Ceviche - 5 stars! I absolutely loved this! Very refreshing!!
~Grilled Fish Taco - 3 stars - nice presentation and good.
~Beef 'House Specialty' Enchilada - 1 star... the meat was way too salty, and I guess it was so special that just don't expect this to be your normal enchilada from anywhere...quite disappointed on this house special
~Tres Leche Cake - 3.5 stars - it was decent with some whipped cream and strawberries on top, but the cake wasn't so soaked and the cinnamon taste was too strong....

I'd visit again just for some chips and ceviche!!
