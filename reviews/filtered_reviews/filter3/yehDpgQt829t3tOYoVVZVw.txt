On our second work trip to the MGM, this was a new experience for me. 

Once we were seated, we ordered three batches of the guacamole (mild, medium, and hot). The hot was super good and I probably could have just eaten that all night. The salsas left nothing to be desired, but I believe I only tried 2/3 that they brought out. I do wish they would have refilled them during our meal though, since some people wanted to use them on their main courses. 

I heard good things about the tacos so I had the chicken taco plate. What came out was not what I was expecting, a HUGE platter with cheese and lettuce in one section, chicken in another, beans in another, and rice in the last. Plus a container of tortillas. What would have put this over the edge was well seasoned chicken, but it was just okay. Everyone else's meals looked good, and really my meal was not bad, just wished it had a little more kick. I'd probably try them again
