My best bud has been saying "let's try this place" for.... About as long as I've known him. He saw it on some television show Man vs Food. Okay. I love me some tortas. But it's a sandwich on a bolillo roll. Mmm but I can go and sit and not have to make it myself? And it's probably good right? I mean, it was on TV as its in Sunnyslope. So it's probably "authentic". And they serve aguas frescas? Si, quiero ir. 

Donjay and I finally make it over after church one Sunday with Jon and Amy H along for the experience. Now in true Yelp fashion... I read the reviews and not just write them. And from the reviews I was wary of the infamous Del Rey torta. But.... We order it anyways. 

This sandwich is like every meat a Mexican ever cooked piled high on a soft bolillo. The meats were all delicious, but together they made something of a strange flavor. They didn't mix well. The chorizo was really good. Almost overpowering the rest of the flavors. I found myself eating them piecemeal and not like a torta at all. Digging in with a fork and knife. Oh and side note, don't attempt to eat this on your own unless you are Sasquatch. Donjay and I split this monster and it STILL took me about 45 minutes  to an hour to eat it. I didn't finish my side of chips. 

My horchata was bomb.com. And the service was awesome! Everyone was really sweet and quick and so I really want to up the stars for this review next time. 

I want to go back. I want to try some other tortas. The flavors were all good individually. I think I would like to try some other dishes here as well. I saw they had nopales on the menu! Yum... Ah memories of my nana cutting cleaning and cooking yummy nopales! Please be five star worthy!
