Good chips and salsa? good guac? Check! Location and ambiance? OK. 

Service:  It had potential to be good but our server kept coming back every ten minutes, even after we told her we would be taking out time. Maybe she had good intentions, but we felt very rushed. It was later in the night and although the restaurant was kind of full, there wasn't a wait for other customers. 

Veggie tacos: LITTERALLY some cabbage. That's it. Oh, and one slice of a pepper. Huh?
