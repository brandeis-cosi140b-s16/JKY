Stopped in here with some friends Friday at 9PM. I had been before but just for drinks and stood at the bar. This time we wanted some food and a few rounds. Waitress was pretty quick to ask us what we wanted, but our drink orders were delivered very slowly, especially for the place being nearly empty. I ordered the Ranchero burrito which was okay; it was mostly peppers, the steak was overcooked, and it didn't have enough sauce. While the drinks are expensive, they don't skimp on them. The Jack and Coke I ordered was strong, and our shots of Patron were practically doubles. 

One of my friends ordered the cheesecake and about 15 minutes later we found out they were out so they suggested the flan instead. After about an hour never receiving that and asking for it 3 times, they finally brought it out and said they would comp it for their mistake. But when we finally got the bill, they had charged us for the cheesecake. The waitress offered to split our check which I appreciated. Overall they were friendly, but not particularly quick. It's a nice place to hangout, but the food and service is just okay, Price was a little high, drinks were $8-$15 and food was $10-$15 per plate. I think I would go back, but I wouldn't expect much.
