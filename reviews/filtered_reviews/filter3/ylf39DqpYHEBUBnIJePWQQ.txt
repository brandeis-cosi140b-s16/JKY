I thought the food here was only average.  I ordered the combo plate with cheese enchilada, beef taco and bean tostada. It looked like Mexican food, but tasted like American. I don't like overly spicy food, but the food here needs something extra; it's just too bland. Maybe a more flavorful enchilada sauce and stronger tasting cheese for the cheese enchilada. Maybe a little more spice in the beef taco. The food here wasn't bad, but I was expecting more after reading some of these reviews. The service was good, but the food wasn't good enough to get me to come back a second time.
