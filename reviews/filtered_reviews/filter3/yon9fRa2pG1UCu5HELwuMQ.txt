Cabo Wabo averages 2.5 stars so let's face it I didn't choose it for the menu or service. This place does have a few great things going for it- they took our reservation of 14 (tough to find on the strip without a set menu), there is a beautiful patio located in the middle of the strip (with a view of the Bellagio fountains), it's a fun atmosphere with music, and the price point is low. Sold!

So why only 3 stars? We should have been assigned our own server with a group our size, but we weren't. It took forever to get chips/salsa (which they charge for!), I got my drink after my meal though I ordered it long before, and a couple of the orders were wrong. I asked for no onions or sour cream on my tostada and it had both. Also, one of the girl's tostadas was missing the tostada (no tortillas)! Not sure who else's order was screwed up.

The food was actually really good, no complaints there. But my big complaint was when the checks came (we had 7 checks) I left to go deal with our transportation at this point... I got back 20 minutes later and checks were still sitting there with our cash/credit cards. As you can imagine our hummer limo waited for an extra 30 minutes for us and I paid about $40 more because of it. Not happy with the service here at Cabo Wabo.
