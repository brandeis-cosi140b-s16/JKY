Tried this funky place for their late night happy Hour between 10 and 2am. Only a few folks at the bar around 10:30pm and one Mexican busboy drinking like a fish in the corner of the bar. It is not so much of a Happy Hour in terms of prices. The normal drinks are apparently 9 bucks and at both "happy hours" you can get drinks for 7 bucks and beers are not really a bargain at $4.25 each. So, it is happy Hour in name only and the food is priced more at lunch prices than any semblence of happy Hour prices. The HH menu is large and I ended up with Blue Corn Enchiladas (one shrimp and one chicken) with rice and beans for $9.25. Most other food was around this price range or at least over 7 bucks. The enchiladas came out steaming hot and it is way better to let the cheese cool off before eating this dish. Great chicken and shrimp and tasty Mexican Rice. The key of course is the Green Chili sauce poured over the top and that had a minor kick and left a nice hot, but not fiery taste in my mouth for a few minutes. Would try lunch there sometime again as HH is overrated.
