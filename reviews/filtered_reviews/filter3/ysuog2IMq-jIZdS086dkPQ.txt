The food here is really good.  The service, is another thing all together.  I've never had rude service here, just very slow and indifferent service.  Tonight, for example, my friend ordered a chimichanga with carne asada, but received something else.  We aren't actually sure what was in the chimi he received, but it wasn't carne asada.  

Additionally, every single time we go there, no matter the time of day or how busy it is, we wait a long time to be seated, to get our drink orders taken, and getting drink refills is unlikely most of the time.  The manager passed our table at least twice and didn't notice our empty glasses and craning necks looking for our waitress.  We would be regulars if the service wasn't so awful.  The food is very good but not good enough to endure the terrible service more than a couple times a year.  Maybe that's how they stay in business?
