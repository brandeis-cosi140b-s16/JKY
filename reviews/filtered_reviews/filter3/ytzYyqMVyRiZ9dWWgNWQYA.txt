Well, we finally visited "The Head Restaurant."  

I don't know why, but I'm not excessively fond of Viva Michoacan.  I don't get it.  A lot of people rave about the bean dip.  I thought it was pretty bland and soupy.  I also didn't think the salsa had much flavor, and the chips were pretty burnt.

Our food was also just okay.  Bland.  Generic.  Maybe we just ordered the wrong thing, but it wasn't all that flavorful.  It wasn't NASTY, but it wasn't that great either.

The service was attentive... maybe too much so.  Each server had the same mannerisms and the same exact vocal inflection.  I get the whole idea of scripting, but it was a little creepy.  I called them the Stepford Senoras.  It was that bad.

The other off-putting thing about the place is the photo service.  Basically, you're accosted at your table by a staff photographer who tries to pimp you photos of you at the Viva Michoacan, stuffing your head.  I wasn't prepared for that...I rolled out of bed late and came for an early lunch.  My fianc√© and I concluded that we looked homeless.  Definitely weren't gonna buy THOSE photos, which is awkward.  Not a fan of the whole photo idea.

The three stars were earned for sheer EFFORT.  Between the servers and the mariachi band and the photo service, this place just reeks of desperation.  They are really out there hustling for the dollars.  I give them props for that.  But it's just a bit too much.  Dial it back a notch, Head Restaurant.
