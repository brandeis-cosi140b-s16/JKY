We've been here a couple of times when visiting family in town.  The ambiance is bright, festive, kitchey and commercialized.  The service is average.  The food is average, run-of-the-mill commercialized Mexican.  I had carne asada grilled tacos.  Meat was very good but everything else was meh.  Food presentation is completely lacking.  We ordered a high-end margarita, which was good to very good.  Nothing stands out here.  Great place to party and hang out with friends.
