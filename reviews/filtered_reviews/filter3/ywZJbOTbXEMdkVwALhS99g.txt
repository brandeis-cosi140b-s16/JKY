Food was salty. Lacked depth of flavor.  None of the Green chile or Pork stood out. Only tortilla and salt.

We had the green chili burro and red chili burro, both enchilada style.  There were hints of flavor past the salt, but not much.  My wife thought there was too much tortilla.  I slightly disagree,  I feel it helps the burro itself from getting to soggy, therefore I appreciate the amount of tortilla for texture.  We both agree not enough meat.

I think it's the novelty of the location that makes people like it more than they should. I too love the hole in the wall aspect of it.  Tucked in a side street, no sign.  Take out or eat outside.  I live a few blocks away,  I was really hoping I 'd love this place, but I don't see either of us craving it anytime soon, probably never.
