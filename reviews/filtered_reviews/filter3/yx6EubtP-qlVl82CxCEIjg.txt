I've been there twice for lunch.  Service was slow but ok the first time and slow and unapologetic the second time.  Trendy decor, hip location, nice concept, but just ok food.  Tried the naked guacamole.  It was average.  Very small portion for $8.75.  The Grilled Sweet Corn appetizer is enough for a table for 4.  I was excited for this because I love Mexican grilled corn with all of the fixings.  The chipotle drizzle was bland and the cotixa cheese was minimal.  Left me wanting.  The beans have a slightly sweet taste that I couldn't place.  Caught me off guard, so I wasn't a fan.  The Taco Vampiro, a double tortilla stuffed with melted cheese, chiles, carne asada, guacamole, pico and cheese was the best thing I tasted.  The carne asada was flavorful and tender.  White corn and poblano soup sounded wonderful in the description, but tasted more like puree'd, warmed baby food.  Couldn't finish it.  EVERYTHING needed salt.  This was mentioned both times by all dining with me.
