I would have to say that this place is as "american" as you can get when it comes to "mexican" food.  The fajitas are ok and have a decent flavor to them.  I wanted a little more than a pile of onions though, think about adding green, red and yellow peppers also...

They gave you chips and salsa when you sit down which is nice but the salsa is very mild and when I asked if they had a spicier salsa they said no but gave me a bottle of Chalula to help.  One good thing is that instead of flour tortillas I asked for corn and they had them, not many places do.  Our waiter was great and made sure we have pleanty of refills on our drinks.
