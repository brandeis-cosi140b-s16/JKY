No real complaints about this place - last time I was here, I was fairly pleased overall.  Chips and salsa were a treat, possibly only because I was really hungry.  Pretty good margarita, as well.  I guess the reason this place doesn't get more stars is the food - while not bad, it doesn't stand out much.  I've never had any problems with the service here, though I've never been really impressed by it either.

Eat on the patio - it's not a great patio, but it has a decent view of the Arizona Center's plaza.
