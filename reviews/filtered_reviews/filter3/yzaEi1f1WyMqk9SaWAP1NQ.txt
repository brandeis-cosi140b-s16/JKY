I came here for a business lunch, a group of four and ate upstairs.  Great atmosphere, I loved the fact that in the dead heat of the AZ summer you can step inside and it feels really nice to have the fireplace going and nice and cool with no windows.  The food was ok, it seemed grossly overpriced for what you get, although the portions are quite large.  I got the blue corn smoked turkey enchiladas Xmas style, and their red chile is completely heads and shoulders above their green (although I am spoiled for green chile as I am in NM 10-15 times a year).  The pork adobada looked really good, and the beef tenderloin with crab hollandaise got rave reviews (the last diner ordered a salad, so no credit either way).  Service was good, and I would definitely come back to try the small plates that were listed during happy hour and check out the downstairs lounge, but can't recommend the entrees for the price
