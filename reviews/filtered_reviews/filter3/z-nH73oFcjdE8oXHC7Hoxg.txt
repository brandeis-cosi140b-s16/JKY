Up until the last few visits this restaurant was my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  Lately the quality and preparation of food has taken a nose dive.  The meat preparation (cooked incorrectly) and quality of cuts have been sub-par for a restaurant that charges roughly $25 - $40 per main dish.  

If you want to have a nice appetizer and glass of wine, this is a great place.  If you want to get a nice meat dish or southwestern cuisine I recommend spending your money at a different place unless you live nearby.  The valley is flooded with similar restaurants and you money is better spent elsewhere for a nice meal.
