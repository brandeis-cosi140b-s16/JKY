Okay Mexican restaurant in the Mandalay Bay Shoppes. Like many other restaurants here it is over priced and food is okay. Don't order the guacamole, we thought it wasn't that much extra for such a small portion, but were shocked it was $9 for a tiny bowl. Unless you really crave Mexican food, avoid this place.
