I'm not a big fan of Tex-Mex in general but my mom had a gift card so we decided to give it a try. The service was nice and the waitress was very attentive. (this is noteworthy because my family is the kind of family where every single member has some special order with their meal) 

The restaurant was full of... well I can't even describe the kind of people I found here. Imagine if a rich snob from Scottsdale had a bunch of kids with a pretentious asshole college student from Tempe. Then imagine if their kids grew up and lived in one restaurant. Luckily the seating was kind of private and we went during a time when it wasn't busy.

I don't like corn bread but my family said the cornbread was fantastic. It looked pretty legit to me. The food itself was pretty good. Kind of pricey. Oh man but their margaritas sucked. I think they used store brand tequila or something.
