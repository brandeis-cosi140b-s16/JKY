Last week was the 5th time I have been to Rock Taco and hopefully the last. The service is always horrendous, even when it is not crowded at all. Only giving stars because the food is pretty good (especially the tacos). Every waiter/waitress is slow, does not bring what is ordered, doesn't refill the chips, and our bill is wrong each and every time we go. I brought a friend from out of town the most recent time and was so embarrassed that I brought her here for such sub par service. With all of the other taco joints in town there is no reason to keep returning.
