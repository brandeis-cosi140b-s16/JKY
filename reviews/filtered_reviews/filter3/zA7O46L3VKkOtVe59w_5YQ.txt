This place came as a life saver. One day I went to make dinner but the meat I had defrosting went bad. So we needed something quick and close by. I called the restaurant and ordered. I ordered two adult trays and one kid meal. You can't order drinks.

I thought the price seemed pricey but then again it was a restaurant order not fast food. The food took about 25 minutes (they said 15). When I got home the portions surprised me. They were pretty big sized portions. The food was good too. A bit greasy though.

We joked that it is food for someone who's got a buzz on.

Anyhow. We got good portions and the food was pretty tasty. The rating is 3 stars because when I say greasy I mean It Was Greasy!

Also the staff is kind of blah. Not really mean but I was there ten minutes waiting for food and not one server or hostess was smiling. I also smiled at a few and didn't get the return and I witnessed the hostess interacting with a waiting party and I think she could have been nicer. 

(I worked in a restaurant for four years so morale is important to me)
