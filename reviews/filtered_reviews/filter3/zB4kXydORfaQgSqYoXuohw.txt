A spicy 3.5 stars!  A good value and locally owned venture in central Phoenix.  Stopped in and tackled some tacos to go.  There was a wide variety of meat and veggie options.

Sampled the Short rib and Chile-pork tacos that both had a little zip to them.  The chicken tacos are the safest bet on the spicy barometer, but still flavorful.  The homemade flour/corn tortillas are a nice touch.  I'd take the staff up on the offer to melt the cheese in the wood fire stove as our food was a little cold when we got home.  

I'll definitely go back to try some different combinations of meats and homemade salsas.

(Referring To-Go order) It seems that the packaging is a little over the top and wasteful - although beautifully done.  The food is served up in a circular aluminum foil pan, typical for Mexican fare, and then slid into an orange square sleeve for marketing purposes.  We had two dishes so they were then stuffed into a Spanish Inquisition styled contraption that then binds the two packages together.  While fun to watch the first time, it does slow down the line, then is annoying to cut off when you're to your destination and ready to scarf down.  All in all, I'd rather save the trees and the 45 seconds it takes to wrap them. (Perhaps change the packaging for the tacos as they we soggy when we got home)

The interior/exterior of the building are very contemporary, which adds to the allure of wanting to sit and have a beer with your meal. It makes a great alternative to Chipotle and your dollars stay local.  A few fine tweaks and it could easily be a 5 star experience:)
