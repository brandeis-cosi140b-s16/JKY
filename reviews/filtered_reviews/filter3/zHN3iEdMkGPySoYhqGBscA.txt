It is with heavy heart that I write my first not so good review:( 

I pondered writing this review for a while for several reasons. First of all, I swore to myself that I would only write 5 star reviews because I don't really like saying negative things about a place. I'm motivated by positive experiences not negative ones. Secondly, I didn't want the review to be clouded by my negative feelings that were initially present, as I was still shocked by the service and the bill days later! Finally, I debated on the number of stars to give since I've never written a review with less than 5. I'm an all or nothing type person so my initial thought was to give it 1 star but decided that it would be wrong to do that since I was able to eat the food and finish my drink. 

Just before posting this, I asked my daughter her opinion and she said 2 stars. She wanted to walk out after 10 minutes but she is kinda agro. She thought I was being generous by giving it 3 stars so let's just say it was 2-1/2 stars! 

I also hate writing really long reviews because I start to bore myself! However, this review probably needs to be long because there is so much to talk about. Ok here I go! 

So my daughter had just moved to Vegas,  and had been asking the locals if they knew of a good Mexican restaurant. Everyone told her Lindo Michoacan or Casa Don Juan. So when I came to visit, we decided to come here as it was close to where she lives. 

Ok I'm already bored so I'll just get to the point! Bad service, mediocre food, weak drinks, and high prices!
