I like all of these places until they get way too crowded. Got to be honest.  Hate it when I am in a place and cant move.  Some people get off on that sort of thing but for me it is just time to leave.  

This place is cool though.  The bar is fun, and mexican food is not bad.  Salsa is actually really good.  The salt and pepper wings are a real plus too. 

Fun place to go for happy hour.   The music gets a little loud in the bar at night, but that comes with the territory.
