Well we came prepared for a great meal. Knowing the owner was associated with the owner of Elote Cafe, a restaurant we love in Sedona we came in with a hungry stomach and high expectations, only to be pretty disappointed. The salsa was okay, it was served in a chipped bowl which is not very professional. The guacamole was actually very good, the best part of the meal. I got the tacos and my husband got the chile relleno. While he enjoyed them, they were still mediocre and so were my tacos, at least For the price. They were not very good. I expected more freshness and spice, and they were very bland. 

Service was okay. Got what we needed but we didn't have a knowledgable server who was able to describe dishes and make recommendations, he merely took the order and delivered the food. 

I honestly wouldn't go back, not for the price and the quality.
