Just like an old-western film, there's the good, the bad and the ugly about this place. The food and patio keep me coming back. Their salsa could be a meal onto itself, often filling me up before my entree arrives. Sitting on the patio on a cool evening, with the lights and live band, takes you back to what Arizona must have been like when it was Spanish territory. 

On the flip side, service is usually slow and unattentive. I've had the same waiter several times and he's always been dismissive. Reservations or not, they cannot seem to handle large parties (8 or more). They're catering, while amazing food, isn't very efficient at picking up materials. We once had a party over at 9pm and they didn't show until midnight to retrieve their buffet items.
