The ambiance is what brings people in & it's also probably what keeps them coming back.... that & the strong drinks, lol. 

There's a large patio, but for me it wasn't a big lure because it was hot outside. It was only 90, so maybe when it gets to 100 they have misters? Who knows :)

My sister had a margarita & from where I sat, across the table, it was burning my nose, lol!

For an appetizer we had the guacamole. It could have used a squeeze of lime, but other than that it was good! Fresh.  For my main dish I opted for the blackened mahi tacos, which had a 2 chili rating, the highest on the menu. I was expecting hot, but it was barely mild. The ahi itself was good. On the menu it said it came with pineapple pico de gallo & tomatillo salsa. I got neither. I asked for the pineapple pico de gallo. It was so disappointing! Bland & not fresh. I don't think these 2 corn tortilla tacos were worth $15. I chose not to have the beans and rice the tacos come with, but if you want to get full you'd probably need to keep those :) 

My sister got the California burrito and she loved it. Maybe I'll give that a try next time!
