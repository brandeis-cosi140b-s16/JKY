Decent, authentic Mexican food at a fairly reasonable price - for Vegas. The staff was extremely sweet and helpful in finding a way for me to sit outside when they were full for the afternoon. Getting a little creative, they gave me my food and margarita to-go and let me sit in their currently closed outdoor downstairs seating area. The green chili tamales were good although a bit undercooked and the chips with various salsa accompaniments were all fairly flavorful. I wasn't blown away by the food but the overall experience would push me to return should I find myself at the Mandalay Bay again mid-day.
