I was meeting my wife for lunch at Wildflower Bread Co at Valvista & Baseline. There was no parking & looked like a long wait. I saw Nandos on the way in so I suggested that we try it out. We were seated immediately & were served chips & salsa. Drinks were ordered & quickly served. The waitress was pleasant. I ordered the lunch fajitas and wife ordered the beef chimichanga. Lunch arrived in 15 min & fajitas were sizzling. It was a ton of food! The platter was so hot the meat was already burning so I quickly pulled the meat off the platter & put it on the vegetables. The meat was very dry and tough. It had absolutely no flavor. Wife said that her chimi tasted like it was covered with sausage gravy. She said that the taste was so-so. The chips were great and salsa was good. The guacamole was good. Good fajitas are very important to me so I won't be going back there again.
