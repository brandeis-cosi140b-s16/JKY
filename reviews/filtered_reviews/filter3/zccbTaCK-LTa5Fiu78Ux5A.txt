I love food, but I know how to differentiate between authentic and Americanized version of Mexican food.  I enjoy visiting Cafe Rio for their homemade tortillas, freshly out of their oven and their salads. Guacamole is pretty good, but not fond of their Pork Barbacoa- too sweet for my taste and I'm more used to the authentic version of Pork Barbacoa without the sweetness in flavor.  Hey, if you like the Americanized version of Mexican food, this is your place!  I guess I have visited Mexico too many times to really know what's authentic!
