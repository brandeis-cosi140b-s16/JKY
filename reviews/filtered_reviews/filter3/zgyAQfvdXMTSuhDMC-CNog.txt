The ambiance and service is nice, but do not order he vegetarian burrito. It seems like just a frozen mix of broccoli, cauliflower, and orange and yellow carrots warmed up, wrapped in a tortilla, and some salsa put on top. The veggies aren't grilled or spiced. The veggies just fall out of the burrito if you try and cut it. I ate less than a quarter of it and then finished he rice and beans (which were good) and left the burrito. I went home and made something for a snack since this was so disappointing and I was still hungry.

My parents had the steak fajitas and the combo with the chile rellenos and they were pleased and said they would return. They had wished the server had told us about any specials and about the happy hour drink specials. I probably won't be back since I can get a much better veggie burrito for cheaper elsewhere.
