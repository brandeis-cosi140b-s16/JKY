If you want a mexican food experience that includes an awesome pond filled with happy birds, turtles and fish, this is your place.  The ambiance is awesome.  The food -- not so great.  I love green chili and theirs doesn't quite live up to what I expect from traditional fare.  Like I said, go for the ducks -- and the margaritas!
