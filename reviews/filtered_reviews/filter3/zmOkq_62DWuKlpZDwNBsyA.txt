I had very very low expectations for this place. Normally I wouldn't visit a place with an average of 3 stars on Yelp, except for a local friend suggested it.

Apparently, Los Olivos is an institution in Scottsdale. It's in an old building that was built at the turn of the 20th Century and the Corral family took it over in I think, 1948. They haven't done too much to update the decor since. In a good way. It's charming in its connection to old wild west Arizona. There were old gelatin prints of family members who've now likely passed. Kitschy southwestern paintings. Wood carvings, Native American style. The ambiance is loud, casual and low-key.

On Valentines Day, we were grateful to have a reservation because the entire restaurant (of at least 100 tables) was packed. However, they provided us with quick service and our food came promptly. 

We started with chips and salsa, which I think were free. The regular salsa was tasty and the chips were warm. A lot of water was separating from the salsa (see my pic below) but it didn't affect the flavor.

I ordered Machaca which was pulled apart beef seasoned in pepper and other spices. It was okay but I was in LOVE with the beans, rice and what seemed to be homemade tortillas. The tortillas were paper thin and wonderful. 

Others ordered the chicken fajitas, which were apparently very good. I stole a piece of chicken to taste. It was slightly overdone, but the flavor was there. And the sizzle of its arrival had me salivating. :)

They allowed us to stay and linger and it was a very relaxing experience. I'd go again and get the vegetarian fajitas with extra beans and rice. :)  It's just a fun kitschy place that serves decent food. This isn't fine dining and you're not going to write home about it, but it fills your belly without breaking the bank.
