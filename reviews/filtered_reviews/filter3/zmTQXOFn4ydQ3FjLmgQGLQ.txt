I enjoy the food, drinks, and atmosphere of Lindo. Unfortunately, there have been occasional visits where the service has not been up to par. Coming at non peak hours is your obvious option to increase your chances of getting better service.

As far as food, my suggestion is not to order the typical taco, burrito, enchilada, or fajita. You can find these items down the street in either direction, or hell, you can make them at home. I try and order a specialty dish which is usually a unique take that I haven't had or is not as common.

On the our most recent visit, our party of 7 had a reservation at 7 PM and were not seated at our corner window table until 7:20 with our order not being taken until 7:40. My cadillac margarita was served in a daiquiri glass which was interesting. Everything smoothed out after our order was placed.

The shrimp ceviche could have used a little more kick with more jalapeno. I think a bead of sweat is forming on my brow as I type that I had the camaron a la diabla. If you like spicy, this is the dish for you. We finished with some fried ice cream and that was OK. I've had about half of the beef dishes and have been pleased with all of them. Most of the specialty dishes range from $15-$20 and come with fideo soup, rice, beans, and tortillas.
