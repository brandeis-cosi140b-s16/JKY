I am obsessed.  Now, truthfully, this is not the BEST taco I have ever had but this is one of the best tacos in town. Before you start getting snarky, I did not say the best traditional taco but the best taco.  

I was there on Thursday for all day Happy Hour. I ordered a mango margarita.  It was ok. Nothing spectacular. Honestly, I am glad I only had to pay $3 for it.

Now the food?  Awesome. There is a self serve salsa bar. I ordered the tradional Carne Asada taco and the El Cubano (slow cooked pork) taco with rice and black beans. The two taco platter is so big.  The food was fresh, hot and the flavors all really worked well together. There are about ten tacos to choose from for the the platter. There are also numerous other entree options. 

This is a great group or date place.
