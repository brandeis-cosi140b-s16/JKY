i've sampled the z-tejas fish (and it's fabulous), the southwestern salad (and it's great), and burgers (which are finely cooked) but it's the tortilla soup that keeps me coming back for more. they will add as much avocado as you want and always give you extra cheese in the fist-fulls (when you ask for it). i should also mention that they have a great selection of flavored teas.
my most recent visit wasn't very positive, as it took too long to seat us (for whatever reason, they changed my party of 5 to a party of 6) i pointed this out after 20-some-odd minutes of waiting and were seated immediately.
the tortilla soup wasn't all that good and the service was so-so, although no one complained. i would continue to frequent this place if i lived in tempe.
