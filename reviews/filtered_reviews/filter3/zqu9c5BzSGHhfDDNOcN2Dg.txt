This place is like the Applebees of Irish-themed Mexican food, which right there means it's pretty much stuck at 3-stars for me.

The service was good - pretty standard.  The food was good - not exceptional.  They do have a separate 'healthy' menu, which was appreciated since when I go to eat Mexican food I generally stuff refried beans and salsa into my gaping maw until I can't get out of the seat.  The margaritas were pretty good.  Over all, no complaints.  It's just a very generic, non-special atmosphere, and nothing over the top.

Swing by for lunch or dinner or whatever.  Don't bring a date here.
