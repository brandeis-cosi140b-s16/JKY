I'm only giving this three stars because I love Chipotle food. Delicious cilantro-lime rice and perfectly season steak keep me coming back. This review is solely based on the customer service of this location. 

I work right down the street, so this is a very convenient lunch stop for me. The time to get my burrito isn't what bothers me. I know if I go there during lunch I'm going to have to wait in a line, that's no problem. What I hate is being rushed through the process of making my burrito. I only get three ingredients, so you think it would be hard to mess that up. They've ripped the tortilla before and expected me to be happy with them just wrapping another tortilla around it. One time the employee put sour cream on when I clearly didn't ask for it and asked if I would "just eat it?" Not to mention the inconsistency. Even if I get less ingredients then my boyfriend my burrito shouldn't be literally half the size of his. We're paying the same amount, so I want a size-able burrito! I've worked in food service before. I know lunch rushes suck, but when the quality starts slipping you need to take a deep breath and remember you're getting paid to make the burrito I'm paying almost eight dollars for. I shouldn't be able to tell that you hate your job. 

It hasn't always been like this. There was some new employees hired a couple months ago, and I gave them a break. But it's been a few months and it's time to meet the standards that Chipotle has set for itself. I avoid this location like the plague.
