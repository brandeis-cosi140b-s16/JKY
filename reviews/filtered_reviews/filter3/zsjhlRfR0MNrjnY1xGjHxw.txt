I was really excited to try out this restaurant since the chef had previously done a demonstration at the Uptown farmers market. He made a very original citrus guacamole and I loved it. So I decided to bring my friend. He ordered the steak burrito and I had the elote callejero, and steak tacos. The flavors of the taco were great and I would definitely come back to have some more. My friend was very disappointed by the burrito since the beans overwhelmed the other flavors, including the steak. The restaurant is cute and has friendly staff, but compared to other Mexican places like La Santisima & Joyride, from our experience, it's just ok.
