Tried the Carne Asada burrito on Friday. I walked in and found the place to be very clean and the worker was friendly. I did notice that there was no one in there. Which is weird for a Friday at 12:30 for no one to be there. 

I got my food and my Horchata. The burrito at least looked like a burrito and was of substantial size, unlike some other placed Ive been. The flavor was good and seemed fresh. The Horchata was unique. It had a coconut flavor instead of the usual cinnamon.  

I would go back probably try something else as I wasn't blown away by the carne asada and I don't like coconut. overall pretty good though.
