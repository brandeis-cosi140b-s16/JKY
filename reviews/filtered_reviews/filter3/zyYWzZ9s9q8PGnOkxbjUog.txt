This place was just okay. I guess I am used to going to Mexican restaurants that only take a few minutes to manipulate a few ingredients into whatever it is that I ordered. Not the case here and I'm not sure why--it took around 30 minutes for our (very simple) food to be delivered. The bean dip--it was refried beans in a bowl. Maybe sometimes it is different and unique, but it's nothing special. My dad really liked the beef burrito and the chips and salsa were good, but I'm not sure I'll be back.
