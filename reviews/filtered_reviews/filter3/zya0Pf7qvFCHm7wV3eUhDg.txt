Food was great however service was awful! Table side guacamole was $12 and was barely enough for 2 people so not impressed on the mark up there. Margaritas were not good, tasted like sour mix and a pitcher was $32. You judge for yourself. :) mahi tacos and chicken nachos had great flavor but that was only positive.
