My friends and I have wondered why this place was called Fuzzy's ever since we were freshman at ASU four years ago. When we celebrated graduation on Mill Ave, we came to the conclusion that it is because everything is a little fuzzy when you end up here at the end of a night of drinking. The beeritas are bomb and the Americanized Mexican food hits the spot- decent place for quick eats.
