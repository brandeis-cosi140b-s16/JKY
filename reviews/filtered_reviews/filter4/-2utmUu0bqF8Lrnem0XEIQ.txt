My wife and I went for our anniversary. It's not exactly the typical anniversary spot...but we wanted to go.  Here's a quick run down..

Parking - comp valet, otherwise, it's a bit of a pain...but it's Dilworth

Atmosphere - fun, just loud enough to feel like you can talk 

Food - the guacamole is amazing...must get this! Chips were nice and fresh.  We had the Al Pastor Taco - very tasty. The Tejas (brisket) taco was good. The Barbacoa Pork was very tasty as well. We split all this and were more than satisfied. Dessert was the Quatro Leches...very sweet and good.

When we go again, I will get the  Al Pastor in a Barbacoa set up. 

Service - we have had better, but we aren't picky about this when the food is so good.

We will be going back.
