Ate here with my wife yesterday and overall had a great experience. I had never been in before and I was uncertain of what I wanted to eat. My server ____ I forget her name...but however explained to me how the menu worked and offered some menu items to me that she thought I would enjoy. She was right I ordered a total of four tacos and they were all amazing! The Yellowfin wasn't my favorite, but I am also not a huge fish fan as is. Again it was an overall great experience, and I am defiantly a return customer!
