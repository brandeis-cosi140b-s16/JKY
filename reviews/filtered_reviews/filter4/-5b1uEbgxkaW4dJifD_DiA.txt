I had no idea there was pork barbacoa as I've only had steak barbacoa at other burrito places. Been here twice: lines move fast, food is mostly under $8 each, and portions are generous. Got the pork barbacoa salad both times. It's layered on a tortilla with tortilla strips sprinkled on top. To top it off, they have vanilla Coke and cherry Coke. Score!
