We had a group of 10 and were seated at a very large table that easily accommodated all of us.  The service was great with prompt beverage service and water.  The menu which is mostly Mexican is large and should satisfy just about everyone.  We did not have appetizers but everyone ordered an entree.  The food service was fast with the food being hot and tasty.  I ordered the #1, two over stuffed tacos with beans and rice, which were delicious.  Everyone enjoyed their entrees with almost everyone taking leftovers home.  The restaurant decor was pleasant, clean and seemed much larger inside.  I will be going back.
