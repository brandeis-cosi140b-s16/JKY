I love this place! We stopped by for an early dinner & were seated quickly. This restaurant is very pretty & we had great service. Our food was awesome. I would highly recommend the avocado fries! I'd definitely go back just for those. The salsas were great and the fajitas were incredible. I would not recommend a tostada-- the amount of lettuce in mine was a little bit overwhelming. Other than that, we were super happy with our experience, and nearly had to be rolled out of the place!
