Richardson's is consistently a very good restaurant.  I always find myself here with out of town guests who have never visited Phoenix, and most of the time everyone is happy.  The only thing that prevents 5 stars in my book is my most recent experience last night.  Two people in our large table ordered the same adovada dish and one person's had two tortillas on it and the other person's only had one.  No big deal.  The person who had only one tortilla asked for more and they brought out 4 more tortillas without question.  We were all happy campers.  Looking at the bill later, however, it turns out that the waiter charged our group for two side dishes of tortillas at $2 each ($4 total).  I know we are in the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression and the restaurant needs to make money, but that equated to $1 per extra tortilla.  Talk about nickel and diming.  I will, however, give our waiter kudos for working with me to make the New Mexican Platter vegetarian.  It was delicious, as usual.
