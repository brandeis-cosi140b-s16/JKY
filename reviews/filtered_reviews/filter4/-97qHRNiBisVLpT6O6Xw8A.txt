We have been eating at Arriba's for many years. Their style of Mexican food is different from the rest of the restaurants. They claim to be New Mexico style. I am not sure exactly what that means since I have eaten a lot of Mexican food in Albuquerque and it is not like Arriba's. The real difference is Aribba's food is much hotter.
They have several dishes with Hatch Chilies in it. This is what I come for. I love Hatch Chile. I used to bring suitcases full of Hatch Chile from Albuquerque, grill them and put them into the freezer. 
Some times the chilies are a little hot other days it can be really hot.  Much of the time the chile is not that hot even though they will warn you when you order anything with Hatch in it. You can tell when the food enters the mouth just how hot it is going to be. Before the food touches your mouth you get that, this has the best flavor and it has not even hit your tongue yet.  Your next thought is this is going to be painfully hot. Water does not help. Four different times I have had Hatch that was almost to hot to eat. Take a bite, wait 10 min. before taking another. Unbelievably good. Unless you like it hot order something that does not have Hatch in it. 
They serve corn chips with three sauces. Bean (This can be pretty hot at times), Salsa (This is usually pretty tame), then the hot sauce. It can be pretty hot but not near what the Hatch is. 
They have daily lunch specials that are very reasonable. Every year they bring Hatch Chili in and roast them for you. Take them home put them in the freezer and when you fix you some soup put in a piece. Very Good. 
My favorite dish is the Chicken Especial. 
I am giving them 4 stars. The food deserves 5 stars the service at times is spotty. They seem to go through a lot of waiters and waitresses. Service is about a 2.5. 
Give them a try! There are several of them around town. I have only been to the one at Arrowhead.
