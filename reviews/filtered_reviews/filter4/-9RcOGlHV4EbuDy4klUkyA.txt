This is the sushi burrito of my dreams :D 

Think "Chipotle/Subway-meets-Japanese fusion" and you'll get the gist of this place.  They have large sushi burritos, bowls and salads, with your choice of different fresh fish (spicy tuna/ yellowtail/salmon/soft shell crab/ etc) or chicken, veggie toppings, and sauces. And it's all prepared when you get up to the counter in assembly-line fashion. Much like Chipotle, some add ons are extra like guacamole or seaweed salad. The sushi rice, for a semi-fast food place is great! And the quality of the fish is pretty great too!  

I had a make-my-own sushi burrito in a soy paper wrapper on sushi rice with spicy tuna + salmon + cucumber + red onion + tomatoes + seaweed salad + chipotle mayo + sweet anguille sauce. IT WAS DELICIOUS. I ate the whole thing in one sitting ( a little big but sushi doesn't keep well).  I got a combo just to try the taro chips with cheesey sauce...meh, I'd skip that next time. 

If you don't want to think too hard, they do have jaburritos already concocted for you with names like Redondo & Long Beach (California dreaming much?). 

My only complaint is that this place is kinda slow....or more so that during lunch time this place gets incredibly packed so get ready to wait in line for a while before getting to order. There is also very limited seating. Otherwise, this might become a very regular lunch spot for me :P
