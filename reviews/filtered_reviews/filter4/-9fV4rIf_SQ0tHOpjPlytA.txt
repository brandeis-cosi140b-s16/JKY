For a chain restaurant,this place has some pretty good Mexican food!   I typically shy away from chain restaurants when it comes to Mexican food, because we all know you find some of the best Mexican food in a dive!  However, I've been to Arriba's several times and I've never been disappointed.  I love their chimichangas with green sauce and pork!  The chips and salsa are pretty good and the margaritas are excellent!
