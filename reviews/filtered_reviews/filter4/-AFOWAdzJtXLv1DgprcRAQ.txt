Dick's hideaway is one of my favorite restaurants in the phoenix area. I went there for breakfast and wasn't disappointed. They suggested the meatloaf(that's right for breakfast) and I must say it was good. It was hard getting over the concept of meatloaf for breakfast so I wouldn't order it again, but it was worth the experience. The coffee was good and fresh and the service was up to the task. The price however was a bit high for breakfast after tip and coffee it came to 20 dollars for one person. For lunch or dinner that's fine, but not for breakfast. Granted there was enough food; that had I been joined by a comrade we could have easily split.
