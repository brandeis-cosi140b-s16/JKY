Nice add to the CityScape landscape. If you are going for a weekday lunch, go early.  It is pretty small inside and it can fill up quick.  For that same reason I wouldn't suggest going with groups larger than four.  The patio is great if it is nice outside (as it is most of the year, that's why we live here, right?).  There are great happy hour and patio food specials.  Oh, and just like the home location (Fuego Bistro) a few miles north, the food is mighty tasty!  A bit smaller of a menu, but still oh-so delicious!

If you are a meat eater, whatever you do, whatever you decide to order, PUT THE PERNIL ON IT!  This is delicious shredded pork that you won't want to stop eating!  The cornbread is a winner.  The quesadillas are good too.  Salads, tacos, tostadas, margaritas, and beer.  What else do you need on a beautiful AZ patio?  

The staff is friendly and always ready with a recommendation, which I appreciate.  When I'm new to a place I usually find myself trying to decide between two or three items.  When I ask for some help (i.e. their opinion) in making my decision, the most unhelpful answer is "well, it really depends on what you're in the mood for."  Anyway, they haven't said that to me here!  

In fact, my go-to dish came from a staff recommendation.  It's not listed on the menu, however they will happily oblige.  My advice is to order the Fuego Salad . . . AND PUT THE PERNIL ON IT!  Yum!
