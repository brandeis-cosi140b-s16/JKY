Cool decor/vibe. Like all restaurants in this area, they've renovated an old building downtown. It has been made to feel like a seedy Mexican cantina where you might hire someone to kill your boss, while at the same time being a cozy little bar you would feel comfortable taking your mother to. We tried the mole chicken enchiladas, and the shrimp tacos. I typically find mole to be too sweet and rich, but the chicken was so flavorful that the mole wasn't overpowering and created a nice balance. The shrimp is VERY lightly battered and served in small corn tortillas with small pieces of mango and a jalape√±o crema. Typically mango served in tacos is huge chunks and creates too much juice, and/or they just fall out. These are more like mango "shavings", which made the tacos much more enjoyable. I'll come back for sure. Good, upscale Mexican food.
