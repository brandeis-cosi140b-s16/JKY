Is the service here good? Nope. It's really not. But it does seem to be getting a little better. And really, with the exceptions of spitting in my face or insulting my mama, nothing they could do could get me to stop going. And believe me, I have horrible service stories... One including Sylvia herself. 

The thing is, the food is wonderful! I would go for the flour tortilla chips and the chunky salsa alone. Those two together = masterpiece. We typically go and split an entree, and leave having spent only $10 or less. Boom! Deliciousness on a dime, people!
