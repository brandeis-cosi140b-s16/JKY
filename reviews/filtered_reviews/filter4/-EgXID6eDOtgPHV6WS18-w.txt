One of my favorite neighborhood restaurants. We usually tend to go on Sunday afternoons for brunch and margaritas. I love the small, intimate setting of Dick's. I have also always been a fan of exibition kitchens.

Our normal affair usually consits of a reasonably priced breakfast burrito or their creative twist on eggs benedict. It always amazes me how satisfied we feel when leaving, and also not to mention the reasonable price of our bill. 

I would recommend Dick's hideaway to anyone who lives in North Central Phoenix. If you don't live in the neighborhood, Dick's is certainly worth the drive.
