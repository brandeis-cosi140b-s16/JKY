What do you get when you cross Mexican and Chinese fast food?  Chino Bandino.

Annually we try to come check this joint out when we are in town visiting our beloved Padres for Spring Training.  I like to try new things, but I cannot resist their awesome Jerk Chicken.

There are many variations you can try your thrill for either a Mexican or Chinese fixing.  If this seems like a complicated process, it can be.  Go with a Chile Relleno with Egg Foo Young.  The combos are endless.

They have menu ordering system that once you figure it out is pretty much an easy process.  My selection was the Jade Red Chicken + Jerk Chicken Bowl combo.  I went with fried rice and black beans.  It was terrific and quite tasty.

Spicy roaming on my back tongue, the Jerk Chicken is notably worth checking out. I actually ate my entire entree with chop sticks. You will not be disappointed.

Also included is a choice of Snickerdoodle or Chocolate Chip cookie.  I don't have a sweet tooth, but both cookies were looking fresh and tasty.  No thanks, next time maybe!

The fat: Get here early.

The skinny:  Everything on their menu is worth trying once.
