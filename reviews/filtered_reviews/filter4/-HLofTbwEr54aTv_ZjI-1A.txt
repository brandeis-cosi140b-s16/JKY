Had the Green Chile Burro Enchilada Style, with Green sauce - as recommended. La Bomba. I am going to try to frequent this place in the future. I enjoyed the experience. Plenty of customers from all walks of life; Businessmen, families, etc. When I came up to the counter, I was greeted by some very friendly and upbeat employees, and when I asked "what's good here?" they replied "the service!". I totally agree. About $20 for two to eat your fill, and have a nice relaxing lunch on the patio at the benches. Even the hot-ass 103F plus sun didn't seem to faze me until I was walking back to the car... A PHX favorite. Who says we don't have culture in the Valley??? Oh yeah, CASH ONLY - NO ATM. Grab a $20 at the Circle K around the block.
