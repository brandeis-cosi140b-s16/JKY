Excellent food.  Carne asada and chicken chimi was not made like your typical heavy flour tortilla that makes you feel overly stuffed.  Very delicious.  Mild salsa had a bit of a bite but we thought it was perfect.  The service was excellent.  Although it's not a "full service" restaurant, the staff came around to ensure we had everything we needed.  Worth the stop on our way home to Gilbert from Flagstaff.
