It must matter when you go, or be inconsistent, or be a matter of expectations (this is contemporary central-southern Mexican), or maybe the place is declining in quality, because the negative comments just are not consistent with my experience.  I've been twice at lunch time (December of 2005?, and November of 2007).  Neither time was busy (maybe that was key).  Portions were never small.  Ranged from good to great, with a couple of snags.

First time was the best.  I wanted huevos rancheros, but order didn't get to the kitchen in time, but the posole and some sort of pork tacos I ordered instead (yes, I like pork) were awesome so it was okay, and I still dream of the best caramel filled churro I've ever had (the flan was not so memorable).  

Second time, my tamarindo was fermented, so ordered a mexican coke.  Queso fundido was good.  Posole was good, if maybe a little bland compared to the last time.  I think I had tacos with some sort of porkt again, which were maybe a little disappointing compared to my previous visit, but I'm not sure because I was uncomfortably full at this point.  My dining partner was very happy with the chicken w/mole.  Poblano mole is not my thing, but I sampled it (spicy, chocolaty, and good in my uninformed judgment).
