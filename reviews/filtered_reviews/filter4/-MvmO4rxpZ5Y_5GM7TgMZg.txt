Holy good tacos, Batman.  I loooove Mexican street tacos. I want to bathe in guacamole and dip myself in hot sauce.  OK, maybe not quite that extreme, but I really enjoyed my experience here.  First I am not from PHX and I am so jealous that you all get to eat outside in April.  My town is cold and frigid so it was such a treat to have our first meal in this town outdoors at a picnic table with a Dos Equis.  I enjoyed the carne asada and pork tacos.  The steak was my favorite, tender and fabulously cooked.  I loved the corn tortillas.  The guac was wonderful and a tasty add on that everyone must try!  The food came out fast and was inexpensive.  This is a great place to enjoy some friendly chatter over fabulously delicious food.
