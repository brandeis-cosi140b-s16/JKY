Great fast food option in Vegas. If you are looking to eat where the locals do - go to Braddahs! Bowls, Tacos, Burritos, nachos - served all with an Island flare! Kailua Pig, Huli Huli Chicken, Pulehu Steak, even grilled fish, and grilled veggies.
So think Chipotle but "Hawaiian" food! You start with your base, next protein, then sauces - mix & match is my fave - finally, toppings... Cilantro, habanero peppers, etc...
They even have Hawaiian Sun - typically only found in HI!
