I discovered this restaurant after viewing a recommendation by Anthony Bourdain, so while a friend was in town we decided to come check it out. It's located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel which is one of my favorite places on the strip. Upon arrival we were greeted by a friendly hostess and offered our choice of the bar (which allows you to watch them work on tortillas from the open kitchen) or a table.  I felt for Vegas fine dining this place was pretty affordable.
Miller D was our server he was quick to greet us with a smile and I believe could tell we were unclear on if we should try a drink. He recommended the Sueno Cocktail which comes with a spicy salt rim. He was kind enough to do Half/Half in case we were a fan of the spicy kick it offered. Both my friend and I really enjoyed the drink.

The main thing I was dying to try was this taco that I read about called The Viva China Taco , but we also ordered a Happy Family Jiaozi  (delicious pot stickers with amazing flavoring)and Golden Pigs ( Fried Pork Buns) and some Beijing Glass noodles(cold noodle dish with avocado and jicama for an interesting twist). Overall I LOVED EVERYTHING except that Taco I wanted so badly to try. When it first arrived I took a bite of the Beef Tendon alone and it was delicious but when taking a bite of the taco all together with the oyster on top I felt like the ocean had thrown up in my mouth. It just wasn't a good combo for my pallet. Maybe I got a bad oyster I don't know but overall it was an experience I will not quickly forget.

Everyone at the restaurant was super friendly and our drinks were always full. The only reason I have to deduct a star is I somehow was overcharged $20 on my bill. Thankfully my friend encouraged me to keep my receipt and I am dealing with that situation but I definitely feel like this place is worth checking out! I left feeling satisfied and excited to go back to try some more cool fusions.
