I was so hungry after attempting to waste time downtown between meetings (aka window shopping).  I wanted to treat myself to lunch, but did not want a super long wait (it was lunch time), and also didn't want to drop a ton of cash...and I wanted something delicious!

That's when I remembered that I had heard great things about America's Taco Shop (America, by the way is the name of one of the owners, it is not a reference to our continent).  It seems everyone has been hearing great things about America's Taco Shop--I even heard some guys there talking about how it really has blown up (thanks to yelp and news reviews) and that there even is another location in the works.

I got a bean and cheese no-lard (good!) burrito.  I got the regular size which was perfect and chips and salsa.  It was SO GOOD...creamy bean and cheese...mmm...I really should not write reviews while I'm hungry...I'm too tempted to go down there immediately...anyway...

The prices are great, the salsa is to die for (spicy, pureed almost, really great--perfect on the chips).  There wasn't a crazy line (though I make no promises, this place is popular and there was a longer line when I left).  Parking was slightly cramped, but especially decent for downtown.

There is seating outside on a fun large patio enclosure.  You order at the counter and the food is brought to you.  It's a great place to go and eat Mexican food without feeling like you just blew your morning at the gym...that is, unless you overeat by ordering every item on the menu--which you might be tempted to do, everything's so good.
