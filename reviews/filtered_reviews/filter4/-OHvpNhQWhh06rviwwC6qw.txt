For cheap, fast, tasty Mexican food I haven't found a place in Las Vegas better then Roberto's. This location is very close to my work, so it is the one I go to most often. They are open 24 hours and have a drive through.

I only get two things from here: the potato, egg & cheese breakfast burrito (which is more more of a brunch burrito then a breakfast burrito) with pico de gallo added. Or the tasty carne asada California burrito. HUGE portions for $5. 

Fun fact: Did you know that pico de gallo translates to rooster's beak?
I don't get it either...
