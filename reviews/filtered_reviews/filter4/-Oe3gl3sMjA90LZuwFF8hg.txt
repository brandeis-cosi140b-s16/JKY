The food was great (I had the mini platter or something close to that) and it was fantastic.  There was a lot of food so I didn't finish, but definitely delicious.  The staff was good...my only issue was with how loud it was.  There were several kids in the back room, which is only separated by a curtain, so it was so loud I actually couldn't hear my date talking much of the time.  Overall...good place to go!
