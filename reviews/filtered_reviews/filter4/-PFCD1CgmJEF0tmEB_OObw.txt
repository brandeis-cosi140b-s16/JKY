We have gone here twice now. Once after they first opened & then again tonight. The food was good, no complaints. I ordered a chicken burrito; my boyfriend ordered the 3 carne asada taco plate. Both were great, I think he ate half of my burrito but that's nothing new! The chips and salsa are delicious and the margaritas are Yummy! We used to eat at the original Popo's on Indian school when I was growing up so my family was excited to see this one open on our side of town. Good food, reasonable prices. We will be back!
