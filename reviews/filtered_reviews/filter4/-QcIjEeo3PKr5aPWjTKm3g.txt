Ate there today and the food was really good! I had the wild mushroom enchilada which was super tasty! Chips and salsa was also really good! Waitress was super nice and always made sure we had drinks refilled! I would just stay away from the margaritas since they are way overpriced for the size you get! Besides the tiny margarita we got, everything else was great!
