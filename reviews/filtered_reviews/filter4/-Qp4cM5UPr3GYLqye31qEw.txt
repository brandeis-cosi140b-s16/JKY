If I could I would give a 4.5! Came here for the first time with my roommate and the employees were really nice and helpful. We did not realize there were papers we had to fill out but there guy who helped us could tell we were new and helped us out right away. We got to sample some stuff and he gave great suggestions! I went pretty plain with the jade red chicken and pork fried rice but my roommate got the machaca and jerk fried rice. We both LOVED our food! We took it Togo and it worked perfectly. Looks can be deceiving because this is a definite hole in the wall which I am ok with. The only thing keeping me from giving five stars was that the dinning room was a bit dirty. I'm not the kind of person to knock a place for decor. The restaurant was pretty busy so I understand but there were a lot of straw wrappers and what not on the floor so a simple sweeping would have gone a long ways. 

Do I plan on coming back? Most definitely!
