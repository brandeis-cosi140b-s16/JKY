Make your way out here and get the Oaxacan hot dog with some beans and rice on the side.  I'll be waiting.  Now, say thank you.  You're most welcome.

This place is legit.  I've been here a couple times and I so, so wish that they were based somewhere much closer to my house.  Then again, I'd probably just never leave.  I'd just come here when it opened, stayed till it closed, and then everyone would be mad at me for adopting such antisocial behavior.

Everything on their menu is a winner.
