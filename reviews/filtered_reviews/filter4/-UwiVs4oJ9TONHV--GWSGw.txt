I knew from the moment I walked in, this was going to be a great experience.  Dark, moody, flickering candlelight, good smells, people laughing. Friendly waiters who were proud of their cuisine.  Giant blackboards bragging of their culinary specials for the day.  Although not everything we tried was foot stompin' great, it was obvious there was the promise of great food in order here.

What we'd come back for...Oysters Rokerij (a spinoff of Oysters Rockefeller) and their steaks.  

I was not impressed with the Southwestern cuisine we tried on another day.   Now we know what not to order.  That's OK.

Come fairly early if you want good parking.  Parking can be a challenge. No doubt, there is a good wait on the weekends too.

Yes, we will enthusiastically come back when in Phoenix again.
