I said a happy hello to this joint today for lunch and look forward to going back real soon!  It's in the heart of southend with loud colors painting the exterior and an alternative atmosphere when you walk in.  I ordered a spinach quesadilla & the guy gladly said I could add black beans which I was happy about.  It was the size of a medium pie full of flavor.  Spinach was fresh and the ingredients were not like I have ever tasted in a quesadilla before but worked fantastic!!  Pricing is a little higher then most places of that sort but well worth it!!
