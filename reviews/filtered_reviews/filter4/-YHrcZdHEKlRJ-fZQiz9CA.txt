I've been eating at this place since it opened.  I'm not going to stop.  In fact I don't think I could stop if I wanted to- it's too good.  All the tacos are great (I especially like the La Condessa special taco with shrimp) and the El Gaucho burro and Bullet burrito are always a good choice. The place is clean and the staff are nice.  It's not always the fastest place to eat, but hey rushed eating isn't healthy!
