Definitely a fan of this place.  Wish there were 4 1/2 stars.  We had my best friend's bachelorette party dinner here (NYNY seems to have a lot more options in terms of restaurants than MGM!), and it was a great choice.  It's a lively atmosphere, and it's so affordable for Vegas!  All of us ordered full on meals and margaritas, and after splitting the price, it was only about $30 a person!  And the food is gooooooooood.  I don't know what it is about their salsa, but it is DELICIOUS.  I filled up on chips and salsa and I was full by the time our meals came.

The service is fast and friendly.   I will definitely visit here again next time I'm in the NYNY/MGM area.
