We had 14 people in our party and China Poblano was excellent for a large group. It was a Tuesday night and the restaurant was slammed, yet service was still very good.

We ordered everything from beers to margaritas to tacos to pork buns to fried rice. I tried a bite of everything. The stand outs for me were:

-Pollo con mole taco
-Cochinita taco
-Tuna ceviche

Our waitress was very accomodating and helpful. The restaurant also allowed us to bring in our own dessert for the occasion. 

I know some reviewers have commented on how expensive they think China Poblano is for the food, but for us it was a great deal. Our bill totaled a little over $700 for 14 people, including alcohol and gratuity, which averaged around $50/person. Not bad at all considering it was a nice, fun meal with delicious food that lasted over 2 hours.

It's not my favorite restaurant in the Cosmo nor is it my go-to spot for tacos but for a fun, casual place to eat on that property I think China Poblano is a very solid choice.
