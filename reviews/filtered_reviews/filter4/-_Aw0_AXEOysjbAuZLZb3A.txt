Was in town visiting relatives and we went to TQLA for dinner. I was really impressed! I like the decor and atmosphere, server (didn't catch her name, younger gal with dark hair) was very friendly, patient, and attentive. The two salsas you get with the chips to start are very very good. I got the margarita flight (you can pick 3 flavors to try) with the prickly pear, blood orange, and chambord. All were good but the chambord was DELICIOUS. I'm not huge on tequila but that margarita could change my mind! 

For dinner I had the crawfish and spinach enchiladas, which were very very good, the mushroom cream sauce on them is excellent. Very flavorful rice and beans were great too. Boyfriend had chicken enchiladas and gramma/grampa shared the fajitas for two. Everyone was pleased and super stuffed! Look forward to coming here again next time were in town.
