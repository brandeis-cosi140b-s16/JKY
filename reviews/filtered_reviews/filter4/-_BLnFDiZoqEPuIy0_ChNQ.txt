I love coming here with my boyfriend for lunch. I always get the Chips and salsa but always ask for the light green salsa only because it's our favorite! Then I always order the steak tacos. I'm never disapointed with them, they are yummy! It's also fun for us when we go because they have a $3 happy hour where they spin the wheel ever 30 min for a different drink special. I always hope for a Mexican beer to pop up. One gripe, on the last spin of the happy hour it always seems that the bartender "fixes" the spin on Jack Daniels cocktails. WTH!! Who wants Jack anyway not me!! Pacifico beer please! So after happy hour we decided to try the tequila flight and sample 3 types: blanco, repesado, and anejo. We received a very generous pour!! Needless to say we got our buzz on and left happy! 
All and all I love the vibe here but service does lack from time to time, it's hit or miss. I posted a pix of the tequila flight ;)
