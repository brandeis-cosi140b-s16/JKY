Three star tacos, extra star for authenticity and prices.

The adobada was great. Flavor, texture, whole package. Not exactly spicy, but I liked this one.

The brain was tasty, but not on the same level.  Can't be 100% sure that I'm just not that big a fan of brain, but I do like some head cheese on a banh mi...

I thought the corn tortillas were a bit soggy, but the whole experience was good. A bit overrated on Yelp, but a solid taco bar.

Next time I'm going 3 adobadas for $6.
