Taco Tijuana! You put up a great fight in the Al Pastor competition across Vegas!

They serve it a little differently here...in longer thick slices packed with tons of flavor and a bit of oily greasy goodness! It is one of my favorites I have tried so far!  Phone pic of the food :

Too bad the rest of the meats didn't hold their own though IMO. The chorizo is served somewhat dry like Gordo...not much juices or fat going on. The asada was good just like the lengua, but we have had better around town. I think their salsa here needs a little extra love! It's a little more bland than I would prefer.

Service was friendly, and the bang for your buck is good...$2 for pretty much any taco seems like the going rate, and the amount given is fair.  And since it is a brick and mortar place, it is more comfortable to eat at compared to a taco truck, with clean tables, highchairs, and the like.

The al pastor is easily worth the drive! Give it a try and see for yourself! I believe they are open till 1am most nights!
