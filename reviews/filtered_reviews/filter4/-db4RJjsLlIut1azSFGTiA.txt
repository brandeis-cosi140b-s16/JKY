Had dinner there the other night, and the place was packed. After 15 minutes we had a table. The chips and salsa as well as the bean dip were really good, and all made fresh.  We had the fajitas 1 chicken and one beef.  Both were good, and the fresh flour tortillas made right behind us were very good.  They give you complimentary soup which was just meh, but no charge = no complaints.  All in all would go back.
