Who needs fancy, uppity places on Scottsdale Road when you have amazing hole in the wall type places like this?!  This place has it all....good food, ginormous drinks, warm atmosphere, and awesome service.  

Four of us dined here for dinner the other night.  Our server was fantastic!  He was outgoing and personable.  He explained some of his favorite items on the menu and suggested some great drinks!  I had the sangria margarita and not only was it a pretty looking drink, but it was also yummy!  It was red sangria and had margarita swirled in it.  I wasn't a huge fan of the red salsa, but the green salsa was hot hot hot!  Their guacamole was also fresh.  For my entree, I went with the shredded beef flautas.  I thought it was a bit overcooked, but still good.  I wasn't complaining.  Everyone was satisfied with their entrees.  

If you are looking for good Mexican food with great service, this is the place to go!
