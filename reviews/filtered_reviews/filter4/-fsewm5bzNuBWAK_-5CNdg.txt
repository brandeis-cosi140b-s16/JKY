Started with complimentary chips with 3 salsas. Mild is very tasty and nicely chunky. The medium is green and has a nice piquant twang. The hot is spicy enough for me and good. I loved the machaca enchiladas. Filled with tender and flavorful shredded beef and smothered in cheese and an excellent smoky enchilada sauce. Partner had chicken/steak combo fajitas. He said it was the most flavorful chicken he'd ever had and the steak was juicy and fork tender. Mom shared one of her shredded chicken crispy tacos and I wanted more. Service was quick and friendly but a little inattentive once the food came. I could have easily flagged a server down though so not a big deal. We will be back.
