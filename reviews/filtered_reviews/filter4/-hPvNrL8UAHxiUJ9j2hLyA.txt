First time to Container Park.  Walked around and decided to try this place.  The inside is tight quarters but there's a nice outdoor patio.  Staff was friendly.  Great chips and salsa.  Had the three taco combo and a Dos Equis on tap.  Carne Asada, Chicken Mole and Pescado (fish.)   Tortilla was soft but held together nicely and the meat and fish were a generous portion, well seasoned and tender.  Look forward to going again soon.
