This was the second time here , I can't believe I did not write a review thanks yelp for reminding me. We have had the carne asada tacos and the adobada sopes and carne asada fries 
           
The soft taco's are great , we got them with everything on , some kind of avocado sauce , onions ,cilantro. 
The adobada sopes were also good it's a spicy shreded pork not very hot spicy but flavorful spicy . Sopes are corn disk that are soft about 3/4 inch thick. We got everything on them avocado sauce, cilantro and onions. 
            
The carne asada fries are covered in the same avocado sauce with of course carne asada , they also have them with the adobada pork, We got the 1/2 order which is more then enough for two. 
Pretty neat place you order your food from the cooks , who make it right there and they also have grilled green onions and jalapenos that you can ask for , I think it was free. 
             
           They also have different Mexican drinks at the soda fountain as well as regular sodas . Pretty good place to grab a meal or snack
