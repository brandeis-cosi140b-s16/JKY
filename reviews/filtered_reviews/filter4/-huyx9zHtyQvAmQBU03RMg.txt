A nice alternative to the sub-standard fare usually found at airports, but only if you break my cardinal rule about ordering what is in the name of the establishment (burritos in this case). I opted for the grilled chicken burrito bowl with teriyaki sauce, jasmine rice and vegetables. For airport food, this place gets very high marks.
