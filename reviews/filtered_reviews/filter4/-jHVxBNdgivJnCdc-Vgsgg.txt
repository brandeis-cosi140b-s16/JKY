Great costumer service. Decent food. I grabbed jade red chicken, jerk chicken, jerk fried rice combo. It was yummy. I'd say the Phoenix Chino Bandido tastes better but it's always a crowd there. The jerk chicken had the perfect spice to it. Not overwhelmingly hot. I'd tell friends to give it a try if in mood for Mexican/ Asian fusion.
