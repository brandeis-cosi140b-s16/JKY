Solid bet for lunch or dinner in the Gilbert area. I live in Arcadia, but grew up in the East valley and have many friends who still live out on the east side. Since most of them have babies now, I am always looking for decent spots in the east valley to meet for lunch, etc. since it's easier for me to travel (no kids) than it is for them. 

Joyride is similar to several other iterations of the same sort of upscale Mexican/taco concept, like Sol or Barrio Queen. They have a nice deal where if you order three tacos they give you a free side, which rounds out the meal. 

I had the veggie, shrimp and ahi tacos (photo posted) and they were all good. I liked the shrimp and veggie the best, might switch out the ahi for a different option on the next visit. The prices were reasonable for this sort of restaurant  and my friend was pleased that they had decently priced kids menu. 

All in all, we enjoyed our visit and I would certainly visit agin or hit up the Phoenix branch.
