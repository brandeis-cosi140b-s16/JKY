Came on a Wednesday night and was told it was a 30 minute wait for inside but we could be seated immediately outside. My party was fine with the patio...but the tables are so freaking close together! I literally was bumping heads with the person sitting behind me. Anyways, the food was awesome. I had the Bloody Maria and shrimp&grits. Guacamole was great too! Just knocked one star off for bad seating and our server really wasn't that great. She was super awkward and never even checked to see how the food was or anything.
