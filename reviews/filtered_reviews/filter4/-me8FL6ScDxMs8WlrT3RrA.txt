This locally owned family restaurant serves up very authentic mexican food.

They are famous for their tortas and in particular the "Del Rey" which consists of - Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, sausage, chorizo and eggs with tomato, onions, jalape√±o and avocado. This beast is about 8 inches tall and can barely bite into it. All the different items blend well with each other for $8.99

The Del Rey was featured in Man vs Food and is the staple but other items are very good also.

King Carlos V is the double version of the Del Rey and is brought out on a pallet for $19.99.

The tacos and burritos are also tasty and you will not leave feeling hungry. 

We also have had the Mexican drinks aqua fresca which comes in a variety of flavors and which you can't go wrong.

But if you go here the tortas are what you come here for.
