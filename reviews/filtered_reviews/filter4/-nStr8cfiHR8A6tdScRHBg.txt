I bought a Groupon for Baja Joe's after checking out the great ratings on Yelp!  Easy to visit when I go to the East Valley to visit my hateful mother,  my partner and I visited on a Friday night. The place was happy, relaxed and busy.

The food was above average in every way. Great chips (really) and a salsa that had a little kick. Just a little. For an appetizer we ordered the Supreme Nacho and we were blown away. The chips were smothered in a cheese sauce that tasted more like a cheddar fondue. We totally scoffed down the tasty flavored shredded beef, beans, sour cream and guacamole. Best. Nachos. Ever.

My Stuffed shrimp w/crab and wrapped in bacon, was good but  a little dry. The sides of were wonderful rice and potatoes reminded me of spanish restaurants in New Jersey where I am from. Next time I will try their traditional food like shredded beef enchiladas . My partner ordered three tacos- on fish and two carne asada and he was very happy except no baja sauce for his fish taco. His refried beans were creamy and delicious with the mexican rice.

Baja Joe's is a great value and it really is a nice atmosphere like a neighborhood hangout. 

Still dreaming of those nachos, and will bring my hateful mother there for her birthday next month.
