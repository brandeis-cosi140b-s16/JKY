I was looking for some good Mexican, and the Yelp reviews all (mostly) pointed me here, which is a good thing since it looks a little sketchy from the outside, and I never would've gone without seeing it here. A friend and I ventured in on a Thursday right after work, and we were the first ones there at 5:30; by the time we left around 7:15, the place was hoppin' with mostly yuppies and families.

Our waitress was so nice! We started with the queso fundido ($4.49), and it came with chorizo and onions - a new thing for me, but delicious. We both got the tacos al pastor ($8.95), and they were superb! My friend wanted them to be a little spicier, but I like mine sweeter, so I was all set.

Great food, great service, inexpensive - a fantastic trifecta!
