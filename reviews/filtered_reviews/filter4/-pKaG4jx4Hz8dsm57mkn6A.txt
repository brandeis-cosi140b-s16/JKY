The restaurant is a needle in the haystack as far as location goes. In the most unexpected of downtown areas, this cafe blends in on the outside but stands out with it's relatively classy interior and of course, with it's delicious food. There are few vegetarian options but the cheese enchiladas with roasted vegetables on the side came in a big platter smothered in gooey cheese and warm goodness. My brother had some meat dish but as a side were chipotle fries which were golden on the outside and the inside (quite possibly some of the most delicious fries I've eaten). They also serve a guacamole with pomegranate seeds in it which was surprisingly good paired with what seemed to be home-made tortilla chips. 

We went there for Sunday brunch (for which they have a special menu) and although the prices are a little up there, the portions of the food are in line with the cost.
