Second time here. My fianc√© and I ate lunch the other day and tried a few things. Tortilla soup ,  Chicken Tacos and Chips and Guacamole. All were very good and would definitely re-order. The soup is one size and more a large bowl so good to share. The food is flavorful and has some spicy to most dishes which I prefer. Tried the chicken enchiladas this evening and thought they were as well very good. I'm glad this is open. Good lunch spot and dinner. Easy to find. Casual atmosphere. They did a good job to make it not look like the Taco Bell it used to be. Go check it out. Not on a date nite but take a look for lunch or dinner. Good stuff.
