My man and I were craving pupusas one day and I remembered while dropping off some dry cleaning that I saw a place next door.. Esmerelda's I think??? Well "Esmerelda's" is no longer there and Komex is and we could't be any more pleased. We had been wanting to try Komex for awhile but never found ourselves in the neighborhood of their original location... 

The interior is nothing special.. comparable to an upgraded Roberto's.. but the food mmm mmmm mmmm,,, There is now no reason to go to LA to get good Korean fusion tacos/burritos.. We ordered take out and as we took our first bite we knew that Komex was a winner... We ordered the bulgogi burrito with kimchi, kimchi fried rice with chicken and 3 different fusion tacos. Well, we halved the burrito, barely made a dent in the fried rice and couldn't even touch the tacos so that tells you a lil something something about the portions... The food was soooooo yumm and we will definitely be going back...

HOT TIP: get extra hot sauce... I believe it's made in-house and if you love garlic then you will LOVEEEE their hot sauce.. mmmm mmm MMM
