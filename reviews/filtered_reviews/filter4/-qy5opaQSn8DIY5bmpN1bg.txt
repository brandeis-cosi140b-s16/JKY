Not sure if you want Chinese or Mexican food? This place solves that problem. Love the Emerald Chicken and the jerk fried rice. The place is set up cafeteria-style - long tables and sit where you want. You can also get a sampling of many of their items and they explain what they are and how their ordering system works. It's not complicated, but it's helpful to know.
