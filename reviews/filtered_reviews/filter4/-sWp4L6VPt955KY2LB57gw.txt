Came here with my family of 6 which includes a one year boy. They were very accommodating to our needs. The food comes out hot and they even let me make my dish, The Presidente, all vegetarian. It is yummy classic American/Mexican food. This isn't their fault but it is pretty cramped and we had to sit at two separate tables for all of us to fit. Great Saturday lunch spot- just be ready to nap after because they are very generous with the portions.
