Sharing property with a freaking Sapphire's strip club, we initially drove passed this place. Not the most family friendly of locations, but we gave it shot as it was just me and my wife. Stepping in right around 5:30 p.m., we were seated without any wait. A quick look through the menu we quickly noticed some inflated prices, both with the food and drinks. I suppose it's to be expected in Las Vegas, but their off-strip location would suggest otherwise. Chips and salsa came out in due time, and we ordered the tableside guacamole after reading the rave reviews. The guac was flat out spectacular; a huge offering, perfectly seasoned, fresh ingredients, and definitely one of the best I've ever had. With the complimentary chips, salsa, an order of guacamole, and a pitcher of perfect Margarita, we were near full, and ended up splitting a Carnitas burrito. The burrito came out already cut in half, and strangely enough some differences were noticed. My half was scalding hot, an obvious microwave job. My wife's came out luke warm, and almost seemed to be prepared differently. We almost questioned whether or not they cut our burrito and someone else's, swapped halves, and sent them out. Either way, my half was solid. Quality ingredients, excellently seasoned, tasty carnitas...my complaints would be they didn't use a burrito tortilla...more of a wrap, and it was microwaved until scalding. Hard to deny the flavor, and some of the quality food and drink we enjoyed. Bottom line, keep the kids at home, bring your appetite and checkbook. Solid Mexican food a bit off the beaten path.
