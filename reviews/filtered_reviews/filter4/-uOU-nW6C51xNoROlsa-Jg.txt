I eat here once in a while with the mindset that when I do, I am eating the healthiest mexican food.  The low calorie count are even posted on the menu to prove their point that Chipotle is less fattening than what you normally get in other mexican restaurants.

Expect a very american taste to the food served here.  The burritos don't taste like authentic mexican burritos but nonetheless it's still very good.  The chicken burrito is my favorite and it's up to you individually of what you want inside you burrito, something similar to the subway concept.  I like mine with black beans, brown rice, hot & medium salsa, lettuce, sour cream and guacamole.  You can also order it in a bowl instead of having it in a tortilla to lessen the calories.

Overall if you've never tried this, you should! I know its a mix review here in yelp but for me personally I think the food here taste great.
