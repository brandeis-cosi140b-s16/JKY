We have been here a few times in the past few years... we found this place due to the Entertainment book coupon.
How do I say it? It is not our favorite place, but we would not mind coming here again...
The issue this time is that they seemed to be very busy... we try not to go out on Valentine's day but for some reason this year we ended up here... and they were busy, but like hectic/unprepared busy... It felt more like a place with employees in training, than a established place.

Don't get me wrong, the service was good, but perhaps they were shorthanded.

We had the cheese dip, too runny for my taste, on the plus side it comes with flour tortilla chips, which was a nice change.
Chips were light and crispy, and really hot. Salsas were good. I like spicy salsa but the mild one tasted better to me. I like how they use those containers instead of bowls.

I had the menudo bowl, which was not that big and... well, I have not found my favorite menudo in town yet. It was a good soup, I liked the meat was cut in small pieces, and it was a good soup but not a great menudo.

Hubby had the chicken fundido and he said it was ok but he didn't love it.

Oh, something else I didn't enjoy... a lot of people smokes near the door to the parking lot... : ( even while we were waiting for a table you could smell the cigarrette smoke : (
