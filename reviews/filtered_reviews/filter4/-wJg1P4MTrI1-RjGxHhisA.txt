A wonderful local taco shop with a distinct hippy/geeky hybrid vibe! You will have no trouble finding this place, it really stands out on Camelback with its funky design - look for the VW bus and a beach-style patio; inside you will find comic books and a cool figurine of Spock.
But onto more important things - food & service! 
Service - can't complain. It's always the same two people, and the girl who takes orders is really friendly and cool. I don't normally use words like "cool" in reviews, but here it is apt. This place is trendy and hip, without being hipster and tacky. The staff just comes off as the type of people you would be friends with and hang out with. It's counter service, so you really can't ask for more than a friendly intelligent face behind the counter, and Two Hippies are super rad people! 
The food: I've sampled the menu, having the burritos, nachos, tacos etc... They were all good, but there is really one item that keeps me coming back time after time: the fried fish taco.
One of the best I have ever had in my life. That good. 
For about $3 you get a huge piece of nice fried fish, and the toppings are perfectly balanced with the fish. The sauce is tasty - no tartar on this. 
While I recommend trying anything on the menu (caveat - the nachos were really disappointing)... I feel that the fried fish taco is a MUST HAVE. They are highly addictive, and you will forget you are not in San Diego or Puerto Penasco.....
If you want to go to a really fun place, with super cool staff, and the best fish taco you will have in Phoenix.... Two Hippies on Camelback is a treasure to be discovered!
