So being in AZ for the weekend - I'm for some reason being taken to only taco restaurants.. I'm OK with that... cuz obviously I LUV FOOD! 

So Saturday night we pull up to this little spot in Scottsdale to meet up with the rest of the crew and sit and have a drink - I ask the bartender give me your best 2 tacos - so I get the carne asada and the mahi mahi- 

The carne asada was delicious, it was tender spicy and just melted in your mouth- i instantly gobbled that one up right away- The girl sitting next to me advised me that the mahi mahi was the best she has ever tried at the restaurant. So i drink my drink and talk with my friends, after about 10 min I decided to dive into this scrumptious mahi mahi taco.. only to be left disappointed- if i wanted to have dessert on top of my dinner i would eat it that way- to say the least i wash left unsatisfied with the taco. 

My good friend said here try a little bite of this... it's the lobster taco... i said OK why not.. 

OMG! The flavors were amazing it was spicy, soft and succulent, and just melted on my tongue.. my tongue actually woke up and my mouth was exploding with flavor! This is what i was waiting for... 

This is a good little spot - i would definitely come back again- the service was great! friendly and perfect. 

my tummy was happy!
