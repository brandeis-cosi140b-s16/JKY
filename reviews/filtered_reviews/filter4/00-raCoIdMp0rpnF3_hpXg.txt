I came in for lunch and just barely beat the rush. It was just after 11 am and the parking lot filled up quickly. Inside the dining area there is an okay amount of room with options for a booth or table, but sometimes there is still a small wait to be seated since it gets so busy. There was a good amount of staff on hand to take care of the customers and during my visit our server checked on us often. We started with complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip. The salsa had a fresh taste, but I didn't care for it and it was think instead of thick which I personally prefer. Chips and bean dip were great. The beans really had a nice flavor. 

The menu has a lot of options. On the back of the menu there were over 30 different combinations for lunch specials. The specials run from 10 am - 5 pm Monday thru Friday with prices ranging from $8.95 - $11.95 and meals include rice, beans and drink. Priced at $9.95 I chose a beef taco and cheese enchilada. The taco was filled with a nice portion of shredded beef and had tons of freshly grated cheese. I loved the taste of the taco shell and all of the cheese, but the beef lacked flavor for me. The cheese enchilada was really good and they didn't skimp with cheese inside or out. The beans like the dip didn't disappoint however there could have been more cheese on the beans. The rice was a bit dry, so I'll just get all beans next time. I was stuffed at the end of my meal and satisfied. Solid spot for lunch or dinner and great for the whole family.
