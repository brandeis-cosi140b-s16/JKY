My husband took me here the other day and I was amazed!! First, if your a newbie, you get to sample most of their menu items BEFORE you order.

The black beans are bursting with flavor and the emerald chicken is a must EAT! You even get a fresh cookie for your sweet tooth and I think this cookie (snickerdoodle) was better than Paradise Bakery! 

Diners drive ins and dives came here and Guy loved it!! This place is tucked away from the main street, but it's worth finding your way here.. Only con is that it's set up like a school lunch room. I continue to come here for the black beans and chicken. YUM
