Round Corner sits high on my list of great happy hours. Their margarita selection is great. I'm not margarita connoisseur, but I've had my share and these are just right. Not too stiff, but they stand up well against the food and other margs I've had in town. 

To reiterate two things that others have mentioned: 

a) This place gets packed on weekends. Get here early or go home sad -- or, you know, wait... but seriously who has time for that?!

b) The outdoor seating is some of the best in the 'Burgh. The back patio has ample space for large several large groups or small 2-4 tops. 

Staff are friendly and attentive -- even when things start filling up. 

All in all, a great place to take out-of-towners to prove that Pittsburgh is actually hip these days -- though that needs less and less defending.
