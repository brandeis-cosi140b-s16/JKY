Since last review have been back many times and still love the place.  As I stated on prior review, I don't come to Phoenix without stopping here at least once. I would love to see one in San Francisco. The food is very unique and creative.  Fish dishes are excellent.  As others have mentioned it can get crowded and service at times is off (hence the 4 stars).  I typically go at off hours (late) and have had no problems.
