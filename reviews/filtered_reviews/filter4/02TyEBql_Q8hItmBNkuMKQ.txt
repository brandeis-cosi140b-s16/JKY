I gave this place 4 stars strictly based on their table side guacamole.  That is a true test when it comes to a "mexican restaurant" and Cantina definitely doesn't disappoint when it comes to their guac!  It is fresh, flavorful and spiced to perfection!  

As far as everything else is concerned....it is just OKAY, in my opinion.  It is a trendy, mexican-fusion restaurant so you get what you pay for...and you pay quite a bit!  Everything is typically pretty fresh and tasty but I don't know if the prices are justified.  

Maybe it's just me, but I can't fathom valet parking and waiting an hour for mexican food.  I like my mexican food straight up, authentic and dirty and so the "hype" around this place is just a little corny to me.  

The parking lot is too small for the volume of guests but they DO take reservations so that is a good thing.  

All in all it is a fun, good place to eat but make sure you have realistic expectations before going!  And, remember--the guacamole alone is worth the visit!
