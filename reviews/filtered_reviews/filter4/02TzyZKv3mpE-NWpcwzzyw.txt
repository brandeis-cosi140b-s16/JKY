Great location, awesome bartenders, good drinks.

I was in Las Vegas for my 21st birthday. I admittedly don't remember much but I do remember I loved this bar. The drinks were strong and our bartender (guy with a Mohawk-I believe his name was Derrin) was amazing. He was entertaining and gave me a few drinks on the house for my b day. He was really the reason we came back the next night.
