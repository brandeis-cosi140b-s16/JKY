We had lunch here today.  Very original Mexican food.  This area of downtown is very much in need of a place like this.  

We ordered guacamole for our chips & salsa.  Guacamole was very good but I wish the chips were warm.  I tried the tortilla soup very good version here (Rick Bayless Topolobampo makes the best I've had).  

For mains we had carnitas & sea bass tacos.  Carnitas were tender & full flavored.  Tried a couple of bites of the sea bass tacos before my wife took them away from me!  They make a mean fish taco!  I washed my food down with some really addictive sangria.  

We really liked the decor & space.  Very comfortable inside.  We will be back to try dinner soon, let's hope they survive...downtown needs more places like this!
