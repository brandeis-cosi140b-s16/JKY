The sign doesn't exactly draw you in. You think there's a drive through, but instead there's a broken menu and a pile of chopped wood. The menu is sort of amateurish, and not exactly easy to gleam what else they have besides burgers...BUT the food is amazing. 

I had no idea where to start here so I just asked the lady behind the counter. She said burritos are the most popular here. So I got a burrito. Very "chipotle" style where they have the meats, salsas, cheese, and other various toppings to choose from and they put it together and you're good to go. This burrito is better than Chipotle. 

I'm actually sad I ventured into this place. It's too close to my place therefore it's too tempting to keep away and I'll get fat by coming here way too much.
