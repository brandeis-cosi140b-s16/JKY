Alright, so a bunch of the other Agents in my office come back from this place for lunch and even breakfast, so I figured I would try it cant be all that bad right.... Exactly!!!

It was very good food. I got the special today which was 2 rolled tacos, a beef taco and a bean tostada, and a another beef taco for one of my coworkers all for about $8.50.

the beef was good, the tacos were fresh and crispy and everything made to order. The only issue I had is they had a lot of cheese on the plater itself, but none of it was even remotely melted, and maybe it's just me, but I like melted cheese. It makes me think fresh made and that it's hot.

The interior was expected, just like a Filabertos or any other taco shop. A Nice Salsa Bar with pico, red sauce, green sauce, Whole Jalapenos and Spicy carrots.

Parking can be a little difficult as they on have 9 spaces two of which are handicapped, but they also have a drive thru. Definitely not enough parking for the table space and outside patio they have.

Well that's all for now....
