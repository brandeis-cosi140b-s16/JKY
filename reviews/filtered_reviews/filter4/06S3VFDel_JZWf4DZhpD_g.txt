I ordered the el pastor and carne asada tacos, and they were great. The wife got the shrimp tacos. They had great flavor, but the shrimp was a little small with a lot of batter. Unfortunately the batter became a little soggy and diminished the great plate. Overall, good food. The freshly made horchata was the most amazing drink I have had in years.....a must have every single visit. The dinning room area is really small, few seats which means it fills up fast. Service was mediocre, not a very personable experience.
