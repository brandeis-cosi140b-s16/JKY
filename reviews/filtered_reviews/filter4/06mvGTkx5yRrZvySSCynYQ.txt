This Z' Tejas on Tatum and Shea in particular has great staff and THE BEST CHIPS AND SALSA! I love their Salsa Verde and could drink it by the gallon! =) Their Chambord Margarita's are par to none and they have a great Happy Hour for appetizers!  I am not as big of a fan of their entrees and they are slightly high on the caloric side; but It is a fun and laid back place to meet with people or just grab a quick bite or drink!
