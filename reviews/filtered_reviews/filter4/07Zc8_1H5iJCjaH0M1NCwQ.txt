This place is crazy. There is a line for each meat. So don't be confused when you walk in and see 4 separate lines, they are different and you wait on each for different tacos. The pork was a crowd favorite and my personal favorite as well. So good and authentic feeling. This place was a nice change of pace from other food in Vegas. I've been visiting family here for years and wish I found this spot sooner.
