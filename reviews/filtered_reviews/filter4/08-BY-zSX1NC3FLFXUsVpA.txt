Note: this is my first review and this is based on my opinions

I have come on vacation to Arizona and me and my folks searched for  Guy Fieri  DDD restaurants in Phoenix. We saw how recommended this place was and gave it a shot. When we pulled up we weren't very impressed by the appearance, but then saw the long line of people and walked in. A cheerful staff, charming and laid back atmosphere. With a large wall of awards and achievements greeting us. I concord with the rest of the reviewers and loved the red jade chicken (and of course a cookie to finish it off). All in all it was a great experience.
