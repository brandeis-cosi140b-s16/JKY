AL PASTOR, ALL DAY. 
The biggest draw of this place is by far the salsa bar. Love all the green ones and the chipotle. Not the biggest fan of the peanut one, but to each their own! Eat the gaucho taco and absolutely the al pastor. The al pastor is a smaller street taco served in two corn tortillas but full on flavor. The meat is tender but with just the right amount of chew and the spices do a great job of cutting the richness of pork. Add a little jicama salsa for crunch and variation.
Chips are good, they're thin enough you can eat several without getting too full. I love the rice-it has corn in it? I'm a textural person and it definitely adds a little character to rice. 
I've seen people sipping on huge cups of horchata and that's definitely next on my list of things to try next time I'm back.
