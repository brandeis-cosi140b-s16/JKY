I wanted to dislike this place. Hokey decor and ubiquitous gringos that come with any american-mexican joint; but maybe it was that I had come in with a huge (15+) group of people and was in generally a good mood from straight chilling on the next-door Hilton's lazy river that framed it positively.

Big restaurant is big: no problem seating everyone, huge outdoor patio, chips and salsa constantly flowing.

Had a Corona light and said to hell with counting calories tonight - it's time for Pollo Fundido, something filled with chicken and jalapeno cream cheese that there is no way you can finish in one sitting.

Came away sated and generally happy with our servers and the copious amounts of beef/chicken/cheese/tortillas/more cheese that everyone at our tables got quickly and pretty tastily. Just get rice instead of fideo with your entree.

Good for what it presents itself to be.
