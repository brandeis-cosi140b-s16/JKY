The food is excellent, but the prices are just nuts. I could easily justify a 3 star rating based on the prices, but since most of the restaurants in the center of the strip are similarly overpriced, I'm deducting less than I otherwise might. 
FYI - I don't think their online menu is updated with current prices as of this writing, but my memory could be off. But there are several items I see for which I remember the price being a dollar or two higher.

Anyhow, I seem to end up here every trip to Vegas, so I must like it. The nachos are massive, the Ultimate Quesadilla may well be the best quesadilla I've ever had (and better be at $21), and the Steak Burrito is a winner. 

Don't be afraid to share dishes as they are pretty much all big - I'm a big eater, and after starting with chips and guoc, I only ate 1/2 my Ultimate Quesadilla. 

Service is friendly and prompt, and they clearly have...ahem...aesthetic requirements for their servers.
