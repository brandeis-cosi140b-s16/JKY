I love their pound cake. The store is clean. There are no flies buzzing or odd smells coming out of the meat and fish department. The staff is super friendly and prompted in assistance. The store has a food court type area and drink stand along with the large variety of fruits, veggies, and other food shopping needs to make your own culinary master pieces at home.
