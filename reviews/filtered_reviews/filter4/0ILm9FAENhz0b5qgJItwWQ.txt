Carne asada taco's and adobada sopes with carne asada fries.  Long lines, order at one window pick up at another, and move onto another to pay.  Lots of people, crowded dinning room, be prepared to fight for a seat.  But the crowds move in and out quickly, so it usually works out.

As for the food, I love this type of taco, small, bite size with an avocado sauce, and adding chopped onions, and cilantro.  The french fries are smothered in the same avocado sauce, cheese, sour cream and chopped onions and cilantro.  The small bite size pieces of carne asada are soft and has good flavor.  Love this for lunch, dinner or late evening treat.
