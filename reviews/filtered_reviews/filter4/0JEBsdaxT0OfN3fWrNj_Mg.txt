We were visiting Phoenix on vacation and decided to check this restaurant out for a late dinner. The location is great, it's very close to the Arizona Grand Resort. The ambiance of the restaurant is very lovely and not too fancy. We went around 8:30 and string lights were hung outside giving the restaurant a classy look. When we got to the hostess she said it was going to be a 30 minute wait, but we only waited about 5 minutes! Chips and salsa, along with the menus, were handed out very quick. Our waitress was very polite and kind! She said if we didn't like something, we could return it for something else (wow)!!! Being from Texas, NOTHING beats Tex Mex so this place was more of a miss for me. I ordered chicken tacos, and they were not bad! The beans and rice had a wonderful spice to them. I would recommend this to anyone in the area for a quick, but nice meal.
