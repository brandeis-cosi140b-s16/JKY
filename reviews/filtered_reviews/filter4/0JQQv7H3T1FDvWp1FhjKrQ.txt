It was a nice small local joint, with a fun ambiance. The tacos were really yummy (we had the basics-pork, beef, chicken). The margarita was nothing special, but not over priced. Friendly staff and the food came out pretty quickly. It's great since we live down the street! Great addition to the neighborhood!
