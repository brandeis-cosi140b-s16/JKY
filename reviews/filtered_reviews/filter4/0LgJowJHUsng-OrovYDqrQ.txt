I've dined here 3 times and have to admit that I can't get past the fish taco!  YUM!  Crunchy, flavorful--So yummy!  There are many other treats to try at this establishment.  The decor is fun, seating in a booth is comfortable with others and the service is always consistently right on.  They will do for you whatever it takes!  You place your order, and it's there in hardly no time at all.  Fresh!
