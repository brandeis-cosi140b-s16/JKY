My wife and stopped by the other day and as soon as we walked in they offered us a sample of the zuccini soup with corn. Best soup I have had in a restaurant in very long time. In fact we ordered some and took some home it was that good! I had the ribeye torta. It was incredible of course, meat just melted in your mouth. My wife had the chicken ensalda salad. She loved it! I will say that in the last 16 years of living here and eating at many Mexican Restaurants. This is now my favorite! This is a must have for any foodie. Great staff! Super clean restaurant..........A true diamond in the rough!
