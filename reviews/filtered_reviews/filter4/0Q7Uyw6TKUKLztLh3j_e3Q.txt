Los Olivos is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in the valley. If you are truly Mexican or were fed by one than you know exactly what authentic Mexican tastes like. I know some people are used to that southwestern food some like to try and pass as Mexican so that is what their expected tastes are. If you think Chipotle is Mexican food than I would see why you would give a mediocre review for Los Olivos. Personally I think places like Chipotle are disgusting because of my taste for REAL Mexican but that's a whole other review. :)  

I have always been treated well here and I have been going for years. My Tata (Grandfather) was a Mariachi player who's band played at this restaurant back when it opened so I love it when I see Mariachi there..it reminds me of him. The food tastes exactly how I expect it to taste.. DELICIOUS and just like homemade. The prices are very reasonable to me and the restaurant itself is cozy. Also, the Strawberry Margarita I had was so sweet and smooth I could have drank them like Kool-aid! :p

My favorites are their Tortilla Soup and Green Chicken Enchiladas but recently I think they changed cooks because the recipe for the Tortilla Soup isn't the same. No worries though because it's still good! I will always come back here. I would have gave them 5 stars but i'm afraid even though the food is good it's not as good as Comedor Guadalajara but Los Olivos is better in location and atmosphere. Both restaurants are the same in rating for me..just for different reasons.
