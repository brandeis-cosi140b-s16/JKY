I really enjoy this restaurant. My go-to tasty delight here is the Fundido. I get it every time. The atmosphere is nice. I've been here quite a few times, and always look forward to going back. Service is typically good. The one incident I did have was when glasses were served to us with someone else's lipstick on them. That one kind of grossed me out!
