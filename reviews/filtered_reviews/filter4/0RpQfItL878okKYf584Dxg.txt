I really enjoyed our food, except for the fish tacos which were nothing to write home about. I also had the arroz con pollo and the chicken was cooked perfectly although someone who enjoys onions would have enjoyed it more. Eric was a fantastic server and had no problems keeping up with my busy family. I give it 4 stars because I felt that the price was a little high. We paid $45 for two adults and 2 kids. Not ridiculously high but I would have expected a better meal for the price.
