This place started out as a 3-star for me and frankly I didn't understand why it was so damn popular.  The service was always really good, and they are on point with the refilling beverages and the chips and the checking up on you.  But the food was just average to me.  After my last experience there, I can now say that it was a "me problem!"  I just didn't order the right thing. 

I finally tried the tacos rather than going the burrito or wrap route.  The tacos, my friends, are legit.  I got the tuna taco with the wasabi honey sauce and the tofu taco with Thai chili.  Boo yah!  They were both tasty, with an edge to the tuna.  

Now I see why people wait an hour and a half on the weekend to eat here.  Just be prepared to experience that wait.  And when you finally get seated, order tacos!
