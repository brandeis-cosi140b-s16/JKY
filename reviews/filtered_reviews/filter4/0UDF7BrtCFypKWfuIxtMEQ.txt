I've been here quite a few times and have a great time each visit. The bar area is really cool, you can hang out to order drinks and still get appetizers/meals served. Their Guac is amazing!!!! They make it fresh after you order it and make it as spicy as you'd like. The meals are tasty and unique from most of the other restaurants in the area.
