Was a little turned off by the snobby hipster waiter serving us drinks while we were waiting an hour for a table but a friendly young lady helped,  and ultimately the wait staff and Food made up for the bad wait.  The drinks were refreshing and different,  we had a mix of quesadillas and guacamole appetizers,  both delicious and the fish and carne asada tacos were delicious and filling.  My next visit will be earlier to cash in on the happy hour specials, I will be back for sure...
