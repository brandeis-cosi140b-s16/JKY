After wanting to try this place, we finally got take-out saturday for lunch. Located opposite the car dealership (high school and golf course are other markers for the same side of the car dealership). You might miss it because it's in a little corner of a little strip-mall on the same side as the VCA animal hospital. 

I chose the full plate of mixed fried rice- chicken, beef, & shrimp (so I could share it with my son) while my husband got the beef burrito. I had my rice with the hot sauce and it was quite tasty. The meats were very good. The beef was especially tender and sliced thin. The veggies were cooked perfectly. I guess the only thing that would likely ruin fried rice is if the rice were mushy; but no issues here. My son liked it too; I just had to cut the chicken into smaller pieces. My husband didn't think it was anything special- I had a bite of his burrito and it was pretty good to me (but I suspect he was comparing it to Truk-n-yaki). I really liked the fried rice, but I saw so many things I'd try in the future, like the nachos, torta, or the kimchi fried rice. If we were to go to the Meadows Mall in the morning, I could see getting take-out from here again.

The vast menu is split between fusion and mexican. I wanted fusion, but that's me. Hubby said that there was a huge sign on the wall, stating "items are made to order." He described the inside as being larger than a hole-in-a-wall and noted there were a couple customers inside dining. The korean man at the register highly suggested the tacos and burritos for a first-timer. And hubby loves burritos. 

Like I said, I wanna try other items on the menu. So, we'll be back.
