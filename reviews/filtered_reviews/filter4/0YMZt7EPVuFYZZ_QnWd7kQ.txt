We were here at 2pm on a Friday - the wait for outdoor table would have been 30-45 minutes so we took a seat at the bar.  We were served quickly and I enjoyed my Salty Chihuahua margarita (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-hefe-tempe?select=-k7Q8fXH1tRNndEyS8foAw#rfbhPZTZ4KMR8EUYtvVcZg) - not the best I've ever had, but it got the job done.  You definitely want to get the chili lime salt on the rim - so good.  The bloody mary was only ok - it was way too sweet for my taste (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-hefe-tempe?select=-k7Q8fXH1tRNndEyS8foAw#-k7Q8fXH1tRNndEyS8foAw).  A nice open layout but I'm guessing it gets packed later.  Good stop for a large drink on a weekday afternoon.
