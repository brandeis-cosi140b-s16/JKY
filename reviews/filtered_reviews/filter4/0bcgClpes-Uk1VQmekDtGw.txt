I went here for the first time yesterday with the boyfriend. He grew up going here and loves it. 

Its a cute little restaurant and PACKED. The staff is very nice and everything is quick and clean. I forget the name of what I got but it was chicken with cream cheese melted over top. It was huge and delicious and we also got a cheese crisp with guac, which you cant really go wrong with that.

I also had a horchada which was yummy and the perfect dessert. 

I'd definitely go here again since they have the more mild Mexican for me and it makes the boyfriend happy. Make sure to text the little thing they have on the flyer since you get a little freeby perk!
