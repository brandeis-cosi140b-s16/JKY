We decided to try this place out after shopping at Costco.  The staff was friendly enough.  I got beef and pork tacos and the husband ordered a chicken quesadilla.  The food is very good for fast food.  I just wish that they had some mild sauces because not everyone likes hot sauce and burn your ass sauce.  Also, the counter is too high.  Little people like me can't see what's going on with our food! :)
