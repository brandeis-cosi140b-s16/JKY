Right when u sit they give you chips salsa n beans yummy I love beans with chips. Service was alil slow being that I was the only 1 here at 9am lol.... Margarita was good I had the regular De La Casa... Ordered chilaquilez (if thts how u spell it lol ) they were good. Wish it was spicy tho. Rice beans are good. I would definitely come back.. :)

Warning* Plates are very hot and they don't tell u till its on the table and u touch it. My Thumb still hurts :(

P.s I'm a picky person hard to impress :)
