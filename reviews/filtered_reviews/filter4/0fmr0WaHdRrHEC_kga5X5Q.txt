I got the El Rico. It's a fried and baked burrito topped with Monterrey Jack cheese and jalapeño cream cheese. I opted for the steak and I was pleasantly surprised. Typical Mexican food can be a bit bland but this was the exception to that rule. The steak was exceptionally well seasoned and the jalapeño cream cheese gave it just enough heat without being overpowering. I will be back.
