My children were afraid to come in.  "Why are we eating at a place with barbed wire around it?" I heard from their tiny little voices.

After we finished eating they asked, "When are we coming back?"

Yes, the food is very, very good.  

- The red enchiladas are probably the best I've had.  Spicy, flavorful sauce with perfect tortillas
- The shredded beef tacos were full of juicy meaty goodness
- The tostada was ok
- The quesadilla was solid
- The salsa has a nice balance of bite and breadth
- Service is friendly
