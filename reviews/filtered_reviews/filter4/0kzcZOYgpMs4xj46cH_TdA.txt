I'm really lovin' this place! My friend and I decided to try this new place out for happy hour one rainy Thursday and it was super packed. The decor was very trendy and modern...it had great ambiance and energy as we stepped in. Since we had already eaten we each got a "Casa Margarita" which is their traditional margarita served on the rocks with lime...no mix used here guys and gals this is the real thing! We also munched on some yummy chips and guac, it had a great flavor to it and was kinda chunky just how I like it! 

Good thing we ordered something to munch on because these margaritas were very strong! I think we paid less than $10 for 2  GOOD margs and  guac...score!!!  I'm a fan and will be back to try some of their tacos.
