Small Food Restaurant with a short simple menu.

Choice of Burger or Street Taco. There is one burger the Standard  which comes with 2 patties and a few options to that which the Carmelized onions are pretty good. The burger is very tasty with the char flavor off the grill loaded with lettuce and tomatoes.
I tried the short rib taco with Pico De Gallo and was pretty good.

Also had their chocolate shake and french fries. Chocolate Shake was nice and thick and came with a boba straw. The fries were crispy and good.

The main item seems to be the burgers which are pretty good so there are so many burger restaurants in the Arcadia area this one is overshadowed but on a different level from the gourmet burger restaurants and they seem to be just a casual small local owned restaurant. 

I like their small feel and will come back again.
