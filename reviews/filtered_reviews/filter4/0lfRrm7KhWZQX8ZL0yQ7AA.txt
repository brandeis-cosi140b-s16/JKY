Got here at 1pm. Only two tables eating lunch. The Chips and salsa
is quite fabulous! Ordered spinach enchiladas, it came with saut√©ed zucchini and rice. 
My friend ordered chicken enchiladas. We ordered the cream sauce
On the side because I was afraid of all the YELP reviews about the excessive cream.

I thought is was a wonderful lunch. Total lunch bill for two people was $28. Including a $4 
Bud light. ( little pricey) but no different than eating anywhere else. 

I did not order the table side guacamole, but to defend the $9.99 price, I watched it being made at the table next to us. The waitress used three huge avocados, which are $1.99 each right now at Bashas.  So people that are complaining about the price of the table side guacamole price really should go buy the ingredients yourself and make it at home. 
What else???  The place is huge and has a corner location. I can't imagine the rent on the building!  I thought the prices were fair, they have coke products (not flat coke either) it is a nice clean location and every staff member was very attentive . The waitress was pleasant and well groomed.  I would go back.  So that's my review in a tortilla shell! HA!
