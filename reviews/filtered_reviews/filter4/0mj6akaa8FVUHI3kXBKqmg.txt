Top notch margaritas frozen and regular make your own with top shelf tequila margaritas and great chips and salsa and queso.  Who cares about the food.  Although I had the guacamole salad and suiza enchiladas and they were good.  It's a little on the high end $ for the quality of entree, but again who cares.  Did I mention chilled shot glasses.
