We were going to see Rascal Flatts at The Joint. We were told this is not a great part of town and the crowd was different than the strip. But Pink Tacos was recommended. We loved it! Expect a line to get in, it's worth it. Loud rock music of course. Skulls and cherub angels is a bit strange for decor, but the vibe was fun. The service was great with multiple servers taking good care of us. They are serious about their food. This is no Mexican dive. There is indoor/outdoor seating and it borders the pool area. So the food - I had the Pink Taco Combo, which was yummy even though the enchilada was white cheese and I don't know what sauce. The pink taco was delish and yes they really are pink. Someone is making fresh tortillas in the window at the front of the restaurant. They also served a great presentation including a rib kabob thing that i was too full to try. My hubby had the street tacos which was not too much food and very good. Our friend had the chicken fajitas and she thought it was great. I would definitely go back, just park valet. The history of rock museum everywhere in the lobby is very entertaining, especially if you are as old as we are and remember buying the albums and going to concerts back then.
