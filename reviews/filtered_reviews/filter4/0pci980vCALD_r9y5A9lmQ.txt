Visiting Phoenix and YELP is always out fist go to- I think they called the ratings wrong on this one.  The waitstaff is superb, beer is COLD (always a plus in my book) great parking, super price point and the food is really good.   Jalepeno cheese curds were not greasy and just enough of a bite to keep you wanting more.  We ordered Ahi Tuna tacos and chicken enchiladas.  Ahi tacos are fresh, perfectly seats with some heat- they are on jicama tacos- adds a fresh taste a little hard to handle but delicious.  Chicken enchiladas are not greasy, good spice perfect amount of sauce, cheese and chicken.  We will be back before we leave Phoenix!!!
