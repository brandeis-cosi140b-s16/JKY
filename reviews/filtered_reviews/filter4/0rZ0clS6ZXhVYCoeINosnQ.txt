I have been coming to Las Glorias for a few years now, and it's about time I tell you why :)

Each month I get a BOGO in the mail from them, and when I take my two kids there, everyone loves the complimentary fresh, hot, thin chips, fresh cilantro salsa and tasty bean dip, and their entrees as well.  

My daughter, who dislikes Mexican food, orders the cheese pizza and chocolate milk from the kid's menu (yes, they turn a blind eye and gladly serve the kids' menu to those even a tad older than specified age!).  These, too me, are nothing special BUT, to a 13yo girl, pizza is always #1 choice!  My son and I each order one of the $9.99 2-item combos plates, and only eat 1 of the 2 items on each plate, taking the leftover 2 items, beans, rice home w/us. He orders Lemonade, & I can't pass on the (all day/everyday) .99 cent Margarita. And we order a side of sautee'd vegetables, as I make sure my kids at least have a few bites of veggies at dinnertime.  The food is always fast, hot, and looks better, more authentic, home-made.  With coupon, & 20% tip (yes, 20% tip is BEFORE discount), I am out the door for $37.

Beat that!  Now you know why I keep coming back!  The service is always friendly, and there are some very pretty waitresses there, as well...darn the luck :)
