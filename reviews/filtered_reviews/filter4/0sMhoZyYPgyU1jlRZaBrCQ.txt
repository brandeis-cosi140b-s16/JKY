This restaurant is a sister property of the local Lindo Michoacan restaurants. I've never been to any of them, but went here last night and was very pleased. 

The salsa was a little hot for my taste and I'm not sure the chips were homemade, but they also serve an awesome bean dip with this chips and salsa, so I was pleased. They also give you a bowl of some noodle soup which was pretty decent.

I started out with a Timo's Cadillac margarita, on the rocks, of course. It was excellent! Very nice amount of alcohol and any margarita with Grand Marnier and Triple Sec is going to be awesome. 

I had the three-enchilada combo and got one of each chicken, cheese, and beef. Muy Delicioso, and I don't normally go for enchiladas. They were SMOTHERED in cheese, so not exactly healthy, but what Mexican food is healthy? Another cool thing is they serve breakfast all day. A friend of mine ordered Huevos Mexicanos at 8pm and was very pleased. 

It was Saturday night, so they had a live band; three Hispanic guys walked around the restaurant with three guitars singing some songs in Spanish. They were excellent! 

On your way out, be sure to pick up one of the white Pina Colada candies at the hostess stand.
