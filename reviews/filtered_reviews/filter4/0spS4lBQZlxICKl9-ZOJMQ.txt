Like most hipster restaurants, this one has both its go-to signature qualities that it does well, as well as some things to just straight up avoid. 

First of all, the chips aren't free. Grow up, Bakersfield--you salt the things so heavily, so as to make your customers thirsty, yet charge $3 for a basket of them. Granted, the salsas are pretty good, and the guacamole ($7) is very good, but come on--chips should be free. 

Moving on to the tacos: maybe it's just as well (for their benefit) they charge for the chips, because unless you have lots of cash to drop, you'll want to fill up on them before your tacos arrive. These tapas-sized morsels are absolutely exquisite--go for the Pork Pastor with pineapple or the prime rib, but skip the fish--but are so small for the price; three are barely a satisfying lunch. At $3-4 a pop, you're talking about dropping at least $15-16 before even thinking about booze. Or chips. 

Bakersfield has a few good strengths, but there are a couple of drawbacks--including the parking situation--that keep it from being a true home run. Will I return? Sure, but only if I can find a parking space. Sunday afternoon was a good time to go.
