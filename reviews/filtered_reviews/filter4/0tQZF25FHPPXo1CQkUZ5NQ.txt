A fun place to grab a drink and  bite. I went on a Thursday evening and it was full but there was no wait. Cool decor, cozy place.

Food: they give you a huge basket of chips and two different types of salsa when you arrive.  I had their original margarita which was super yummy. They also have some other specialty cocktails. The menu is a little limited (reason for 4 stars) But their are several taco options including veggie options. I got the corn taco and steak taco- special shout out to the steak taco because the mean was super tender and not a nightmare to eat (like steak tacos can be..)

Generally a fun place- Carson street parking is tough but it's fun to be close to the bars and action.
