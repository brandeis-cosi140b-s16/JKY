I think I found my favorite mexican food restaurant.  I drive past several mexican food restaurants on my way to Si Señor, and I am happy to do so.  My test as to how much I like the food at a mexican restaurant is how well they do my favorite dish - cheese enchiladas, with rice and beans.  I find it shocking how many mexican food places do that dish poorly;  however, Si Señor did it great!  They serve a variety of salsa and bean dips with the chips, which I really like as well.  They give you a free Sopapilla (a deep fried pastry) at the end of your meal, which is a nice touch, and very delicious.  Interestingly, they catered a recent business event at my place of employment, so I had a chance to try the Chile Relleno a few days ago, which was also very good.  The restaurant is not glamorous, but comfortable and clean.  There is plenty of parking, and the staff seems nice and courteous.  Despite being there on a busy Friday evening, the food was still delivered quickly, and it was delicious!  I will definitely be back for more, and I don't plan on waiting very long before I do.  Please give them a try if you are in the mood for good mexican food.    By the way, it is New Mexican food, rather than Sonoran mexican food, so know that going in - I don't even really know the difference, but that is what they tell me.  I do know that I like it though, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!

Update:  I have now been back several times, and they have not disappointed me.  Their tacos are very good, and they make them just the way I like.  This is definitely my go-to mexican food restaurant.  If you haven't been, you owe it to yourself to give them a try.
