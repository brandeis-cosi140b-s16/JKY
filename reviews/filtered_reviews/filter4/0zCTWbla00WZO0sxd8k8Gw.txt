The best Mexican, hands down. 

For starters, the homemade chips, salsa and beams are incredible. I don't even like retried beans, and I couldn't stop eating them. The salsa is thicker and slightly spicy - delish. 

Margaritas are some of the best that you will let past your lips. Whether you prefer frozen or on the rocks, they are delightful and hard to refuse a refill. 

Fideo soup. Fideo soup! This soup will keep you coming back for more, as they have truly ramped up the flavor. It is perfectly clear that they have poured love into the broth. It's delicious!

Do not get the tacos al pastor if you want to be able to eat them somewhere else. The flavor is knock-you-on-your-ass good. The meat bursts on your tastebuds just before the pineapple sweetness starts to tango. It's phenomenal. I will never be able to order this anywhere else. 

The service was impeccable. The staff constantly checking and asking you how you are enjoying it, refilling beverages and truly interested in your visit. They will box your food for you, and everything is fine with a genuine smile. The live music on Friday nights brings together the circle of authenticity. 

So where is the fifth star? In the non-existent parking lot. This is the only improvement that needs to be made. We parked at the gas station, and we're lucky to get the last spot on the whole block. 

We're stoked that this place is right down the street from us, cuz we will be back - frequently!
