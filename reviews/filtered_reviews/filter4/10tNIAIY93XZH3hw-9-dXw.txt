I love this place- the chips and dips that come free on the table are so good, and the mushriom spinach enchiladas are off the hook. So amazing, and a mo ths worth of cheating in one meal. Just have to mention a couple of things that have disappointed me in my last few visits. At least the 3 most recent times that I have decided to go to Leticias have been based on the awesome weather, and wanting to sit outside on their patio. Every time, Ive been told that they have no server for the outside. Its not like I went there once a week for 3 weeks. How can this be? The patio is amazing, and so cute, and when the weather is good, to sit outside and chat and eat does not compare to sitting inside with a/c and a loud restaurant- so that was a bummer. Multiple times. The other thing is that I got my world rocked by the vegan tamales on a previous visit, and tried to order them on the next few visits, and was told that they were out of them. If it werent for those things- it'd be a 5 star. Please Leticias- get some people to man the patio. The weather is amazeballs right now, and Im getting the itch! Dont let me down!!
