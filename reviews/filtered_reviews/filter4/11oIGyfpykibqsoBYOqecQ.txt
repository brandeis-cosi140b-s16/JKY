My friend just raved about the food so I was very excited to give this a try. A group of five of us stopped by for dinner before First Friday Art Walk this month. The place was busy so there was a bit of a wait, just about 15minutes or so, not bad. We were seated and placed our drink orders. Our waitress was great. Very friendly and prompt. 
It took FOREVER to get our food. So long that one member of our party had to leave as soon as it came. 
This was (seemingly at least) in no fault of our server however. She did check in on us frequently and let us know that it was coming, there was just a large party ahead of us.
We got our good and it was delicious.
I had the Salmon Spinach Enchiladas. It was wonderful very tasty. The chipotle cream sauce drizzled on top was soooo good!
I tasted my friend's Chicken Relleno, also very tasty, however hers was a bit on the dry side. She has had it before and said it was not usually as dry.
The only other issue I had with the food is that it wasn't hot It wasn't cold by any means, I just got the sense that it was left out for a while.
I would give this 3 and a half stars, but with as flavorful as the food was and how excited my friend was to come here I rounded up. I will definitely be back soon and am expecting to be able to give it a higher score next time.
