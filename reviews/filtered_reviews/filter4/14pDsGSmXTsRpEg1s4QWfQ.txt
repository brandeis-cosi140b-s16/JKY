I had dinner with friends at the Chandler location on July 4th. the restaurant and restrooms were very clean, which is something I always notice. I had the Alambre de Camaron, Fire-grilled, bacon-wrapped shrimp stuffed with fresh jalape√±o and blended cheeses. It was very good, not spicy at all, and it came with this cheese/jalapeno dipping sauce which went very well with the dish. It was my delayed birthday dinner, so they threw in a cookie chip type dessert with ice cream. Decent food, at a reasonable price, and an attentive waiter. A very pleasant experience all around.
