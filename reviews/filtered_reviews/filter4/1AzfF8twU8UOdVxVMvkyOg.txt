We've been coming to Abuelo's for a while. Originally from New Mexico so it's pretty hard finding an actual authentic Mexican restaurant. 

Surprisingly the salsa's offered as soon as you come in range from sweet to spicy which is a good thing if you like hot salsa or mild. 

I always order the enchiladas which never disappoint. 

The service here usually varies. We've had a handful of good servers but there is always an occasional bad server. She must've been having a bad day. 

Overall, great food and environment.
