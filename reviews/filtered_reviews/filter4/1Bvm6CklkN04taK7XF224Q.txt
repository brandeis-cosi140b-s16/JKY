I can't remember the exact name of the margarita, but it was the one with a bit of honey in it and highly recommended by our friendly bartender.  The drink itself was pretty huge and surprisingly strong...I couldn't finish the entire drink since I was already gooooood mid-glass. Our friendly bartender also hooked us up with complimentary chips and dips to nibble on. Overall a nice, low key spot to chill.
