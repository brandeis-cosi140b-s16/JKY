This is definitely one of Champaign's nicer dining establishments.  I went in with a friend for lunch.  It was pretty empty in there, but it was sort of after the lunch rush and it was during the week.  We promptly were served ice cold water and some delicious banana bread muffins with butter for free.  I ordered a freshly squeezed limeade, a nice twist on lemonade.  

My friend and I both agreed on getting the Cuban sandwich.  So many different flavors playing into this sandwich.  Sliced ham, a deliciously marinated shredded pork, Monterey-Jack cheese, pickles and a whole seed mustard topped off the sandwich served on baguette bread.  My friend commented on how he doesn't usually enjoy mustard but really enjoyed it on this sandwich.  

The sandwich was accompanied by a side of mixed greens in a vinaigrette and some sweet potato fries.  Sweet potato fries are always an A+ in my book and the mixed greens were a good add too.  The fries and salad weren't anything to get super excited about, but definitely yummy and helped fill me up for sure.  Left there with a whole other half of my sandwich and one of the muffins. 

Lunch is extremely reasonably priced and although I understand it to be a little more expensive for dinner, I can't imagine being disappointed from what I saw from this meal.
