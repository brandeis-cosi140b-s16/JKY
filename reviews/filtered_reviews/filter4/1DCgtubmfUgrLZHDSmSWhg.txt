Overall, good experience, but could have been a hair better.

I ordered the #6 Chicken Tamale Deluxe Combo because of what other people have written.  The chicken green corn tamale is just as everyone said said, a unique flavor that really satisfies.  If you can get one or two unique things out of a Mexican restaurant then you've done well, and this was it.

A close second was the ground beef flour taco.  I usually don't spend much time ordering tacos at restaurants but this one had a shell that was hard enough to hold it's form but soft enough to bend a little when you took a bite.  The bottom of the shell mixed with the juices from the beef and created a texture that I'd not had in a taco before.  Delicious.

One disappointment was the shredded beef flauta. Nothing to write home about and without a knife I ended up stabbing it and taking bites off of it.

One other disappointment was the salsa and hot sauce, but I chalk this up to personal preference so I don't really downgrade restaurants because of it. The salsa had chunks of fresh veggies but the flavor wasn't to my liking, and it had quite a bit of juice in it.  You ended up getting some veggies on top and then juice which ran off of the chip.  The hot sauce has an earthy flavor to it that just didn't do it for me, but others seem to enjoy it so to each his own.

Last point, the rice and beans were excellent.  Some places try to do too much or too little, but El Bravo found the perfect balance of spices and natural flavor.  Really enjoyed it.

As for the extras, the restaurant is easy to find and there is plenty of parking.  The wait staff was very friendly and the food came fast.  Not much ambiance but you're kind of looking for that from time to time.
