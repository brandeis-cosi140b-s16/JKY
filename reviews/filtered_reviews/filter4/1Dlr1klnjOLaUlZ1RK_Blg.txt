Yup I'm a fan of this place. We made a reservation for a sunday brunch. It didn't seem that busy when we arrived but I still recommend to get a reservation so you get a spot for sure. I would rather come here than any other buffets in Vegas because you don't have to wait at all and it was quite good. 

So we decided to try the all you can eat tapas menu which consist of 15(around) items which can vary from appetizers to entrees to desserts. Our awesome waiter was super helpful in telling us what was good and recommend we could do. Since we had a party of 8, he made it easier for us by simply putting it in a family style plate where 4 of us share and the other 4 share. The food really depends on you but I really recommend the Steak and eggs, breakfast fries, and the corn tamales. 

Reason why I love the steak and eggs was because it was super flavorful and the steak was actually good quality(and it's all you can eat so go wild man). The breakfast fries were awesome in which it consist of every man's dream...bacon,short rib, fries, cheese, egg....like imagine that into bites of yummyness.  However these two items I mention are super deadly, so my personal favorite that is super light was the corn tamales. I personally think it's adorable how they wrapped the tamales. THey provide you with sour cream and salsa. It's not a lot in the tamales but it's really good and light. 

Then there was our awesome waiter, Mike, that was super attentive and friendly towards us. He made small talk, he helped us a lot with the menu, and I simply befriended him(I wasn't even drunk). So the extra star is for our waiter who made me enjoy my time at Border Grill A LOT more. 

There it is people...I recommend giving it a try especially if you're not down to wait 2 hours for a damn buffet.
