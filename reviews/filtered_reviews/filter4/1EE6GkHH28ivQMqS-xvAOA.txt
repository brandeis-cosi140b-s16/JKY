This place is the typical hole in the wall Mexican restaurant you will find. The staff was friendly and the chips and salsa were great. The rice and beans were really good but the enchilada sauce the use did not taste very good to me at all, but that's just my opinion. My wife was happy with her food so I assume I just need to try something else. It is a very clean place. But as the other review says, it would be wise not to come during school hours, as the high school is literally across the street.
