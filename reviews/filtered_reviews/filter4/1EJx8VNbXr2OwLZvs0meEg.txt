This is another in a long list of  "Thank the flying spaghetti monster for Yelp!"

I was flying back from Memphis and got stranded at the airport in Charlotte for the night due to bad weather in NY.  I grabbed a cheap hotel near the airport, took their shuttle bus and ended up  in the middle of some place I knew nothing about.

What to do for dinner?  Well, that's easy, let's open yelp and find something within a reasonable walking distance.

This place pops up as one of the best within a walking distance.  I would have never seen it without Yelp.  It is almost part of a little motel, tucked away in the backside of some parking lot.  I actually walked by it before turning back around and finally finding it.

They have a nice little covered outside seating area. . .and the weather was beautiful down there so I took advantage.  A little noisy because it is almost on the highway, but the weather more than made up for the noise.  The inside looks a lot like a typical American Diner, which was a bit weird, but I don't care much for decor if the food is good.

The menu was a standard and basic Mexican food menu.  I am a big fan of Carnitas and it is always hard to find decent Carnitas in the chex-mex dominated "mexican" food places around my place in queens. . . so I was immediately drawn to that dish.

It was absolutely great.  Nothing special or fancy, but the meat was well cooked (and cooked right which isn't always the case).  The guacamole that came with it was fresh and tasty.  The tortillas were perfectly fine and all of the trimmings were fresh and of good quality.

I then ordered a beer, she asked if I wanted a large and I said yes. . .who am I to blow against the wind?  And this thing was monstrous.  We are talking at least 24 ounces.

My bill came to about 14 dollars, which I thought was perfectly reasonable considering the size of the beer, the amount and tastiness of the meal.

Would definitely go again.
