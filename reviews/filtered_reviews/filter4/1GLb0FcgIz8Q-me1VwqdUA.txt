Many many torta options and all seem quite big.  The place is in a small plaza and the place looks kind of ghetto.  I'm not into many Mexican foods, but I do like some tortas and tostadas, etc.  I ordered the Del Rey, so I could get a taste of one of their popular choices.  The order came with chips, which weren't that crispy, but the sandwich itself was probably worth the money already.  I think I would've enjoyed it more if I didn't try to finish it all at once, but I didn't have a microwave in my hotel room and didn't want it to go to waste.  I think half of the sandwich would have been enough already.  So make sure to come when you're really hungry.   The ham was a little on the drier side, but the cheese wrapped with the sausage and the beef was really good.  But I think it's better to share it with someone!
