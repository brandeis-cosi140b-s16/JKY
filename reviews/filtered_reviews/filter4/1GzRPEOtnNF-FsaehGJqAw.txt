So flippin good.

Went here after a Camelback hike on no food and not enough water.  

Tried the pineapple agua fresca: delivered to the table quickly, tasted fresh, and was oh so good after a hike. 
torta norteña de pollo: demolished this sandwich. The jalapeños and avacado complemented the sandwich perfectly.

If I lived in Pheonix, I'd visit regularly.
