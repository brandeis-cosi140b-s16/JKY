We've been here over a couple dozen times and love it - primarily for the great happy hour deals.  The margaritas are super tasty and strong. The Mexican pizza is huge as are the nachos. Both are way too big for one person.  Try the sliders - again a generous portion.  You won't be disappointed.  When not eating off the happy hour menu, we usually eat the chorizo or machaca huevos. Muy bien!
