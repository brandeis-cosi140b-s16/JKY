Great Mexican restaurant  and bar in the Aria Casino.  We had some the best margaritas  in town and appetizers.  Bar was jammed packed around six and tables had a long wait.  We sat at a table at the bar wait staff was friendly  and informative.  Suggested  the margaritas. Started with the jalape√±o  margaritas  amazing!  Chips, salsa and guacamole  were good.  We had chicken  quesadillas  and beef enchiladas.  We had a fabulous  time.  Would recommend  for dinner and drinks lively  atmosphere
