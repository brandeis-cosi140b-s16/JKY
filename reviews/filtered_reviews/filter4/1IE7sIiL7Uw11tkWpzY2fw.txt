We went here because we found it on Groupon. The food is delicious, and the portions are so big! We ordered the guacamole and chips--couldn't finish it all because there was so much. The chicken sambana is probably one of the most delicious meals I've had. 4 stars because it can get quite pricey if you don't have a coupon. I get that it's Vegas, but still around $17 a person. Will go again.
