I just tried this place for lunch with my friend and LOVED it! I had the Enchiladas de Dennis, which was recommended by the server, and ate it all up! The rice, beans, and salsa were also all very good and I can't wait to go back. The bar looked nice, and I loved the bar stools. Next time, I'll be coming at dinner time so I can also try out their margaritas :)
