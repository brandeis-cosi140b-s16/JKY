The question we often ask ourselves between connecting flights in airports is "Where am I gonna find a drink and food that won't kill me?"

Maybe it's just me. I've wandered the McCarran airport several times, but now I've found a solid place for a drink and food. We sat in the bar area and decided on a couple drinks. 

I ordered the Top Shelf Margarita, because I deserved it before the next long leg of our flight. My guy ordered a beer and when the lady asked if we wanted a shot for $2 with that, immmmm yes of course he does. 

We split the shrimp taco plate which was good small lunch for two. It comes with two big shrimp tacos, rice, beans and chips. 

Everything was pretty good for airport food. Ha! I'm kidding, Se√±or Cuervo.
