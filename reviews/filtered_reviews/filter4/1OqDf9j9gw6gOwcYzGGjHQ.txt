We met with family at Blue Adobe recently.

I had the Cruz Kitchen plate (Chile Relleno, Tenderloin and Carne Adovada) and my wife had the Carne Adovada.


The red chile on my Cruz Kitchen plate was delightfully spicy but not a challenge.   The Chile Relleno was crisp on the outside but not soggy or overdone. The tenderloin was wonderful.

The Carne Adovada was wonderful.

My wife enjoyed the prickly pear margarita with dinner.


All in all a very solid restaurant to add to our New Mexican cuisine rotation.
