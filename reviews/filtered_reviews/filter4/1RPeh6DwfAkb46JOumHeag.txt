I love that this place serves warm bean dip with their chips and salsa, it's the perfect combination. Today I tried the chicken tamales with green sauce, hands down one of the best restaurant tamales I have had in quit some time. 

The servers are very attentive and friendly. I will be going back to try other things on the menu.
