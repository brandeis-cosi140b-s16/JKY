The salsa is chunky and delicious! I got fajitas, they were decent and my wife got enchiladas, she got one with green salsa and one with red salsa, she liked the red salsa the best. I didn't have any problems with my refills, the waitress was nice and efficient. We finished our meal with fried ice cream and we all enjoyed it. I would recommend this place.
