I went into Vida today with some friends. The hostess was very attentive and we sat down right away. The chips were warm and very good salsa. We had a variety of entrees , I had the philly taco, and the fish taco and they were really fresh tasting ! And the margaritas ! Yes!  I also overheard from one of the staff,they have a new chef! It's really hard to find decent Mexican food in Charlotte . I think we found it!
