It was my wife's birthday dinner, and we were seated right on the Canal at The Venetian, what a great atmosphere!!  I ordered the roasted pork and I have never tasted better.  The General Manager, Annaliza McKiiey made sure every part of our meal was great.  Everyone in our party raved about the authenticity of their meal.  We will go back to this establishment every time we are in Vegas!!!!
