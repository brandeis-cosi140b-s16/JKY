We were closing on our house and needed a place to eat, stopped here because we both love mexican food.  The place was typical but clean and friendly.  We both had something different and liked it a lot.  The salsa was cold and very good and fresh.  The waiter was talkative and friendly.  Our food was hot and plentiful.  WE will definately go back and probably take some friends.  New to this area, we are trying new restaurants and this one will be on our list since we eat out alot.
