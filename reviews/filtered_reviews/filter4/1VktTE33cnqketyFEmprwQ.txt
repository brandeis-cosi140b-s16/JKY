I've got to break this review down the middle. The food quality is just about average. Reasonably priced bar grub, tasty but not delish enough to satisfy the true foodie in us all.

Started with the chips and salsa. Three dipping sauces. The Rojo picate was by far the best of the three. Pretty average as far as chips go. 

2nd course...Carne Asada street tacos. Fairly priced and tasty, even with the corn tortilla. Good carne. 

For entrees we split two dishes...the shrimp salad and the Black Angus burger. Salad was average. I think they're trying too hard with this dish, trying to pull off a sweet spicy warmth but didn't quite get there. The burger was above average. Really liked the mozzarella cheese with red pepper topping. A natural combo, sure to work! Wonder why I haven't run into this before ;)

The atmosphere is very relaxing, lively and warm with the inside / outside bar top and great fire pit seating. Not to mention they have like 150 sections of tequila and a little bit of Mezcal. Very nize....:)

Nice joint, would recommend it for sure as a happy hour staple in anyone's monthly rotation. 

Cheers!
