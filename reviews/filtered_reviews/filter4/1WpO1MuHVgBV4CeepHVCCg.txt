This place is great.  I originally tried it from a Groupon purchase.   Have been back several times since.   The shredded beef and red chili beef are the best I have ever had at  any mexican restaurant.   Not an ounce of fat in either one.  The salsas are all top notch.  They offer a chunkier type salsa that you must ask for.  Please do this, it is a great salsa.  Also, try the San Marcos sauce a cream cheese type mixture that is simply wonderful.    I did not care too much for the enchiladas.   The beans and rice are fine.  The only reason I gave four stars instead of five are the ambiance and lack of margaritas.   The place is very old and dated.  Popcorn ceilings and dark paneling.  They do offer beer and wine.  They do have  a pseudo margarita that is made with wine rather than tequila, however I have not tried this yet.  Service is average.  Not good not bad.  Try Pedro's you will not be disappointed.
