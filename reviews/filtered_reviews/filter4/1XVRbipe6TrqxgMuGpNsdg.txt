Had a great lunch experience here recently. My shrimp tacos were very flavorful the perfect size for lunch. Fresh salsa, guac and chips were always replenished in a timely manner. I can't wait to go back and try some of the margs! I love they have a Tamarind marg, my fave flavor. Looking forward to returning soon :)
