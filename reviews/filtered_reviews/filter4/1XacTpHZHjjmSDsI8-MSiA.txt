I'm so thankful Upward Projects - the restaurant-building brand that brought the Valley favorites such as Postino, Windsor and Federal Pizza - finally opened a Mexican food joint with their Gilbert spot Joyride Taco House. The Central Phoenix version debuted last month, and I went there this weekend to sit on the colorful expansive patio in this gorgeous Valley weather.

The décor and menu at Phoenix's Joyride is the same as the Gilbert location. I love Joyride's chips and salsa. The salsa is the perfect level of spiciness, while the chips are thin. They're the perfect way to start your meal.

At both locations, I ordered the Veggie and Goat Cheese Enchiladas ($9) - they were just so darn good the first time! They come smothered in both red ancho chile and salsa verde sauce and are bursting with that delicious goat cheese.

It's a really massive entrée, but I still ordered a side of rice ($3) and black beans ($3) - am I the only one who thinks rice and beans need to complement every Mexican meal?

That is actually probably the one thing I would change here: make the entrée portions smaller (for example, one enchilada was plenty for me), and add rice and beans to meals. As it is now, I received two complete meals with what I ordered - at only $15, that's not bad, either.
