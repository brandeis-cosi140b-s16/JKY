First off, I came here three days in a row for lunch. They're not slow during this time but not particularly unbearable in terms of traffic. I got bowls and their $2.15 tacos. I gotta say, I'm not a fan of their Al Pastor but their Carnitas aren't too shabby. I prefer them over the al pastor. Between the two, I recommend trying the different tacos. $2.15 isn't too bad, for me, at least. :b

There are different stations. There's a bowl/burritos/everything else station and then there's stations for tacos so make sure you're aware of that. I was wondering why I didn't see plain ole tacos on the menu and then I actually noticed the tacos stations later, hah. *facepalm*

Their dining area is pretty spacious and right next to the drink station has all the sauces and lime and stuff. Also, beans, if you really want some more.
