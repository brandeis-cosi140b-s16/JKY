I really enjoy this place, they only lose one star for me because their menu is pretty darn heavy and not super diverse. That being said, if you're looking for delicious, albeit not-so-calorie conscious food, they're tops. Their customer service is excellent too, as their manager (or owner, not sure his role?) seemed so genuinely happy to have my business as a new customer. Food is fresh and tasty, with lots of complimentary add-on options at their little salsa bar.
