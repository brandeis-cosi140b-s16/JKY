SumoMaya is definitely the spot to go for awesome ambience, great decoration and yummy fusion of two worlds - Hispanic and Asian. Wow the pork belly ramen bowl is da bomb especially when you add a traditional egg where when broken, thick gooey egg yolk oozes out and mixes with the soup making the experience feel like you're sitting in a small ramen house in the middle of Nagoya but you're not, you're in the dessert! Ha! The Korean tacos is phenomenal as it meshed traditional marinated Korean beef and the Hispanic fixings of a traditional taco. Wash your food down with a Sake Sangria and you are good to go! Now...if only this place fuses a dish from the Philippines, now that would be nice especially when one of it's roots is Spanish.
