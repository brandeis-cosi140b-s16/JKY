There's so much to love at Tubb's! For starters, the salsa bar is incredible (I can never get enough of the medium salsa). The taco selection is impressive and almost always a sure-bet, though I would stay away from the House-Smoked Chicken taco, which I thought was a little dry. However, my favorite thing might be the Jicama Slaw (I wish I could get it as a side with more dishes). Everything is well-priced, especially during Happy Hour ($3 frozen margaritas!). It might not be as good as the best tex-mex you would get in Texas, but it sure is the best you'll find in the Midwest.
