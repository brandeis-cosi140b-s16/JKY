We have been to Frank & Lupe's many times, but last night was the worst service we have had (but was also the 1st time we sat on their patio area).  The food was still wonderful, full of taste and the kick of heat.
Good stacked enchilada's & sopapilla's.

We certainly will go back again, but wonder if it was a one off or was the patio for the service gap that is not normal for F & L's.
