This is my husband and my favorite restaurant in Charlotte! Our favorite items to get are the chicken quesadilla, burrito, nachos, and tacos (especially the al pastor!). Our only complaint is that the tacos, if you get soft tacos, are usually soaked in the juices from the meat and sauces. By the time they come to your table, they are close to inedible because they're so soggy. This doesn't happen every time, but often enough that we tend to order other menu items even though the tacos are our favorite! Their salsa and guacamole are delicious as well. Although, we think their guacamole is a bit overpriced. We enjoy getting take out from here too and they are kind to offer to put the nacho toppings in separate containers so that the chips aren't soggy by the time you get back home! Staff are very friendly too!
