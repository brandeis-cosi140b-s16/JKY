Good food at a great price, and obviously the vibe/decor is fun, but the service here was lacking. Only two people were working tonight (7pm on a Saturday) and there was a long line that moved very slowly. The dining room really needed to be attended to and have tables wiped down, but no one checked on it during the 45 mins or so my friend and I ate and talked, even after the food line slowed down and we were the only people left there. Aside from the service it was a fun little trip up north, I'd go back next time I'm in the area, I just hope they're better staffed!
