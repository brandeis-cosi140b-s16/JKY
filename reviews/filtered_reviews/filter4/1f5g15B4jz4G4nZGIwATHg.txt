This is definitely one of the most consistent Mad Max restaurants in the chain. Much like the rest, drinking here relies on you being here during Happy Hour or when they have the monthly brewery features where you can get 20oz drafts for 5 bucks.

Particular good favorites include the enchiladas, wing salad with cilantro lime dressing, and the pineapple habenero salsa.

Good atmosphere with the open garage doors, free valet next door, and a pleasant staff at this location.
