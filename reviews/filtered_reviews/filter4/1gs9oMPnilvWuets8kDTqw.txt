Carne asada burrito. Carne asada tacos. Tortas. And watermelon Aguas frescas.  I don't think I've ordered anything here that wasn't good.  This is a great place for high quality mexican food, that isn't too expensive.  The only downside is there is always a wait, but grab a drink at the bar and set your view to the pool where you can view a waterfall wall of wonder.
