I like this place... for multiple reasons. 

Lively and trendy(without being hipster thank god). Reasonable prices($2.25 a taco--the extra change I'm not used to I'll chalk up to the ambiance and alcohol). Having a DJ on the weekends are cool if you want to hang out. Multiple TV's to watch sports are always a plus. Quick service. GREAT salsa bar. Can do small parties upstairs.

Last time I was here they accidentally gave my chicken nachos instead of carne asada.. The guy asked if we didn't mind just piling on the proper meat instead of remaking it. Haaaayyyyy.. the more the merrier. 

Only qualms so far: 
1. They ran out of limes and served lemons(umm.. what?)
2. Not a fan of their house ale.. but to each their own.
