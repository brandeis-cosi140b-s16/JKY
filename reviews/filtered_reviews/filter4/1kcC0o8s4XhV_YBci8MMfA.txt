I saw all the great reviews on Yelp...was looking for some Mexican food and I was closer to the East Side of Vegas....so I thought I'd stop by give it a whirl...
This place was packed at about 1:00PM on a Sunday...Families with huge tables...small tables etc....
I've got to admit they had the BEST DAMN Taquitos I've ever had in my life!
Our server even gave me some Sopitos because I was asking about them.

The portions are pretty big...it's not your hole in the wall Mexican place where prices are cheap though....but definitely worth giving a whirl if you are looking for some good Mexican food in the area

Service was a bit slow but they were very apologetic even without us complaining....I'm not sure if soup is normally free but they gave us some soup as well.
They give chips with salsa like most Mexican restaurants but also bean dip along with it.
