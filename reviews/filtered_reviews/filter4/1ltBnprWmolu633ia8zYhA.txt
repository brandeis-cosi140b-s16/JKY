This place should be called Los Emperadores de La Torta! We'd heard great things about this place and it's all true. Comfortable locale, great service, and delicious food. We had the carne asada quesadilla and del Principe torta. Added an agua fresca (limonada) which was just right. Make sure you ask for the green salsa (hot) for the complimentary chips. PLUS: Delicious grilled onions with the plate. Avocado included in plate, no extra charge. We were too full to get desserts . The meal was $23; more than just. Wear suspenders cuz you'll need them.
