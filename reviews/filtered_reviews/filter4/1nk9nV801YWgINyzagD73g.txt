Good atmosphere, nice location and decor. I love the bathroom door handles and counterbalance across from the kitchen - my wife loves the red ceiling and brick.
Very trendy outdoor eating and bar area, lots of seating - but the bar is tiny, maybe five or six stools.
The wait can be an issue, not a place to go if you are in a hurry or starved. Their guacamole is really good, but needs salt and they stuff the bottom of the cool rock bowl with tons of lettuce. The cilantro is a nice touch. Good chips and salsa, why do they charge for it when their entre's are NOT cheap. You pay for the name here, but the quality has not dipped over the years. Really good margaritas, again, a bit overpriced. I am a creature of habit, if I want something different I will go to another restaurant... I always have the Crepas de mariscos - fish/shrimp/crab stuffed enchiladas. Delicious spicy green sauce and the shrimp is NOT over cooked! My wife got the smoked chicken enchilada and liked it - pretty low key response for her, not blown away.  
We will go back again, they are 'on par' with Frank and Lupe's which is further north in Old town, I think off Marshall. Nice to have two upscale Mexican restaurants in the same area - we gravitate towards Los Sombreros though...
