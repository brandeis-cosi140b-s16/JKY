3.75 stars rounded up 

We were staying at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess & thought we'd stay on property for dinner one night. 

Walking in without a reservation was not a problem. Service is leisurely, so as long as you have time for a relaxed pace, you'll have an enjoyable meal. 

We ordered: 
-- michelada: 3 stars, would have liked a little more lime flavor to compliment the beer flavor 
-- guacamole: delicious, & at $15, probably the most pricey guac I'll ever have! Next time we'll try the sampler. Chips were warm fresh out the fryer. 
-- sweet corn tamale: would not order again; too dense, boring after a couple bites even topped with poblano cream
-- taco trio: I ate the chicken tinga one which was so tasty. Hard to go wrong with shredded white meat chicken & amazing spices 
-- grilled halibut for him

Decor is fun, colorful, but sophisticated. Would definitely return to try other menu items.
