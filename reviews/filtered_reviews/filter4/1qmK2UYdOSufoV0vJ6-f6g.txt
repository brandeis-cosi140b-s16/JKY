This Blanco's location is so nice! You can get a good meal then hop on your plane. I love their pomegranate margaritas and their carne tacos! Even though the tacos are tiny you still leave feeling full. This place is always packed on the weekends so you might have to sit at the bar but its a small price to pay for greatness.
