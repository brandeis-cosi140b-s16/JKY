Cien Agaves Tacos & Tequila does just a couple of things, but they do them really well!

We tried a range of items (blackberry mojito, local margarita, nachos, tacos, rice, beans) but the real stars were - not surprisingly - the tacos and the tequila. 

The local margarita is made with a locally-made tequila, and this was one of the best margaritas I've ever had. And the tacos? Nom, nom, nom. We had beef, carnitas, and chicken - and they were all winners. The nachos were okay, and the beans and rice were pretty standard fare.

Our server, Meg, was awesome. She made great recommendations and she totally took good care of us - making sure our food was good and that our drinks stayed full.

And the price? Totally reasonable for the amount of food and all the local ingredients.
