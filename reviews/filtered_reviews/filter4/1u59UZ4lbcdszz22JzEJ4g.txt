48 ounces of margarita bliss! I'll say it again: FORTY-EIGHT. Yeah! You have to carry around this dorky glass though, but about halfway thru it, you realy don't care who stares at you. 

It's $24, but when you think about it, most margaritas cost about $8 for 8 ounces.... So you're actually SAVING money by buying in bulk. 

Chips were fine, salsa was fine, guac was fine. Service was fine. Booze was awesome. Lots of tequila selection, and if you ask really nicely, you might get to sample some of the different kinds. Look for the bartender with the big earrings. She'll hook you up.
