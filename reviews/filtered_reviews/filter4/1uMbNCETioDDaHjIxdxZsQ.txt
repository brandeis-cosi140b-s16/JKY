Wonderfully thought of concept of melding Mexican and Chinese cuisine.  They work so well to balance each other's flavors harmoniously.  

Have your doubts? Yes, my good friend, Guy Fierri will back me up.  He has yet to fail me and my mission for great cuisine, upscale but slumming it!

1) Walk in, taste food. Lady at the counter is very helpful with explaining the descriptions of every taste sample.  
2) Make selections.  She will help you fill the puzzle-like order form
3) Find seat.  Make sure you listen for your name, as they will walk your order to you and holler your name, sometimes not loud enough
4) Eat, enjoy, exhale.  

Favorites, as me and dining companion had duplicate orders with the exception that I had the machaca in a quesadilla, they had it in a burrito.   Machaca quesadilla won by popular vote...was convinced to share half of mine!  

Emerald chicken had nice gingery flare.  This seemed exceptionally healthy, as it seemed to be stir fried with the seasonings, and meat was made with chicken breast, and not thighs.  Jerk chicken was good, but not "jerked" enough...I was expecting more heat to it. Volcano cookie, soft center, chewy crust.  Yum! 

Knocking off a star because it was hard to find a clean table to sit at.  I could care less if a place is a mom and pop's place, but c'mon...Wiping off a table ain't too hard! DÃ©cor was cute.... Mexican panda bear themed.
