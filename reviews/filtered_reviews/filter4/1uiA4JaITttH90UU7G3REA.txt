I found this place on accident and glad I did. I enjoyed the fresh tortillas and the way they prepared ones food. This place comes highly recommend. Well that's if you are looking for some cool Mexican food done a different way; while in Las Vegas.
They are a bit expensive for the amount of food you get, but it was good.
