Hands down best drive thru tacos in Phx. Extremely friendly service. Really can't go wrong with any taco on this menu. The chips can sometimes be extra salty but I enjoy them that way. Guac is superb. Round it off with an iced tea and you're all set. Lunch hour drive thru line can be long so time your trip accordingly.
