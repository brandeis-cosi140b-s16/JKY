A pure Las Vegas staple with drink specials that will truly get you wasted for less.  I would consider this a step up from a dive bar but the food is decent and the Margarita are on point.  Service is always friendly whenever I visit paradise Cantina and conversation with randoms is second to none.   The place is really close to the airport so if you need to kill some time before leaving Las Vegas or just feel like having a few cold ones on Wednesday this is the place for you.
