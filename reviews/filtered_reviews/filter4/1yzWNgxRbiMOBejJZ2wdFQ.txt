El Torito is a staple restaurant located in "Old" Henderson.  I remember my fiance, then boyfriend, and I would eat here back in High School, and we still try to make the long drive out every once in awhile to have some of the most authentic Mexican food available in this town.  In such a big city, places like this provide a small town feeling. 

My favorite item by far is the albondigas soup.  With a few crushed up tortilla chips, the soup is absolute perfection.  I am also a fan of their enchilladas (cheese, beef, chicken- any kind will do for me).  In addition, their horchata is great as well.  Not too sweet and not too watery!

As far as service goes, it is typically good.  Last time we went, it was a bit slow and we noticed other tables that ordered after us were being served before we were.  But, it was really not a deal breaker because we love the food so much!
