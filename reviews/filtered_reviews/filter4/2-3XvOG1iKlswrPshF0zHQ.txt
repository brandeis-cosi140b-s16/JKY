Tried Los Taquitos for the first time the other night and really enjoyed it. Definitely fast food Mexican but it was tasty. 

I tried the sopas, one chicken one beef, with rice and beans. I've never had sopas before so I wasn't sure what to expect. They were kinda like tostadas but they're not on a hard shell, it's a softer, thicker base if you will. Each one was loaded with meat, beans, lettuce and cheese. They were very filling. Between the two of them and the rice and beans I couldn't finish. The beans were fine, simple refried beans. the rice was just okay. Not bad but I've had better. 

The boyfriend ordered soft shell tacos. They were tiny. We've seen this before, there must be a certain region of Mexico that does tiny tacos? I dunno, it's kinda weird. They're like taco sliders. But he said they were good. So order several if you're hungry.

We went on a weeknight and the place was very busy. A constant line at the counter. The best was the guy who came in and asked if the order his wife called in was ready. The girl at the counter said "what was it?" and the guy answers condescendingly "I don't know, give me a hint." Why would they know what your wife ordered dude? But they actually handled the guy well considering what a douchebag he was being.

I would go back to Los Taquitos but I don't know if it would be first on my list.
