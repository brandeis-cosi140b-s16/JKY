Fresh food, spectacular sauces! What more can you ask for? I went on opening weekend so as you can imagine it was a little disorganized. But, I met the manager and she was very nice and accommodating and made up for the long wait! Definitely give this place a try. I would recommend making a reservation so you aren't stuck with a long wait time. The prices here aren't too bad either. The green salsa verde is a must-try.
