Visiting from CA and this place was recommended to us. We went in for lunch and the customer service was great. This was described as a French/Mexican restaurant. After eating there, I agree. The Mexican flavors were present with a French sophistication. We had the Fillet dish and the Nogadas special. I really enjoyed the use of uncommon ingredients such as pomegranate and almonds. 
$$$, good portion size and worth the money.
