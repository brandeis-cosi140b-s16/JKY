Not gonna lie, was not a fan of the former location at Rainbow/Spring Mtn because of service issues.  The reopened spot at Sahara/Ft Apache does a good job of delivering on service, atmosphere, and flavor.  Not the best Mexican food, but they do a solid job of making tasty dishes.  Before the meal they offer complimentary chips/beans/salsa.  The chips could use some help; they taste like a bag of grocery store chips; definitely not made fresh in house.  They offer additional salsa flavors for $2.5 each, but we just stuck to the original.

I opted for the chile relleno and he had the rajas con crema with chicken.  Both were good.  Before the meal we tried the queso, which proved to be quite a challenge to eat.  The cheese was stringy and greasy, not like a dip.  

The atmosphere is cute, contemporary, and very clean.
