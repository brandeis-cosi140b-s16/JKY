Ah, the Dungeon. How I miss thee. I don't go nearly enough as I should. I blame my Old Town location. 

Anyways, downstairs has a dark vibe with a cozy seating area, fireplace and small bar area. The bacon-wrapped scallops are YUMMY, the tenderloin toast YUMMY YUMMY and, of course, the Malibu completes it all. 

Word of advice, cell phone service downstairs is pretty obscure... at least on AT&T and t-Mobile networks.
