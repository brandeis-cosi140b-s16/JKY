This place was really fun.  it's in a mall, and doesn't look like much from the outside.  Several other restaurants were dead, but this restaurant was packed, and for good reason.

The atmosphere was fun, the service was great, and the food was a step up from the usual mexican place.  It's not fancy food by any stretch - it's just high quality and prepared with care.

The cocktails weren't cheap, but they didn't leave us feeling let down.  The Mezcal Mule was the popular drink of the evening.
