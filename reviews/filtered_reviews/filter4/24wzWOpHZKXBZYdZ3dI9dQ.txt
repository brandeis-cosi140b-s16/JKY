Why, hello, 99 cent margaritas.  

I used to go here with a friend when I lived in the Biltmore area a year or so ago, and I lived and breathed off the shrimp and scallops del mar.  Nowadays, another friend and I like to frequent Arriba for their happy hour margaritas.  The chips and salsa are excellent, and although the servers speak hardly a lick of English, service is generally pretty good.  The food leaves something to be desired, excepting the shrimp and scallops del mar, as well as the chips and dip, but the drinks and service are awesome.  It's just the right place to drop by after a crappy day at work.
