Found this little gem one night when my bf & I were walking the strip and craved some homemade Mexican food. Yelp had great reviews for this spot AND had a $10 for $15 deal. We just couldn't resist. So we bought it.

We actually visited DJ's Tacos the day after (Sunday 1/5/14) around lunch time. It's located in a small plaza, I believe it's called Hawaiian Plaza or something along those lines. Small establishment but the quality of the food definitely makes up for it big time. 

I ordered a taco plate (includes 3 tacos, rice and beans) for $8.95. I chose carne asada tacos, while my man ordered a carne asada burrito ($9.95) and 5 additional tacos ($2 each). I would say the rice and beans portions were a little on the skimpy side. But the carne asada tacos were delicious! They were tender and juicy, full of flavor. ¡Que Sabor! Everything is made to your liking from your choice of beans to toppings (cilantro, onions, etc) to salsa (pico de gallo, jalapeño sauce, etc). The food is really fresh and yummy. Sorta reminds me of chipotle but less franchise-y and more authentic Mexican food. Did I mention that the tortillas are hand made?! Yep, quality. Also, they have one of those digital soda fountain dispenser and horchata as well. Lastly, they have this awesome mural of Tijuana that takes up one entire wall of the restaurant. It is so interesting and dramatic. It's one of those neat little features that makes this place special. 

The customer service is great, too. The two ladies who helped us out were patient and made everything to our liking. They were friendly and honored our yelp deal. This place is awesome, but only reason why it gets 4 stars is because the prices are a bit steep and portions run on the small side

Other than that,  this place hits the spot! Highly recommend!
