I''m not going to repeat what so many already know about KoMex.

My favorite thing(s) to eat here are the fusion tacos...5 stars!  I also enjoy their trio of sauces/salsas

Honestly not a fan of their kimchi fried rice...uber greasy!  It gets 2 stars.  The signature bulgogi nachos also weren't as good as I was expecting...3 stars.

Great waitresses & the food comes out in a reasonable time considering how busy it gets.  People call in to go orders when the doors open.  I always manage to get here right as they open, so I haven't dealt with any wait time.  However, the place is always filled up with customers waiting by the time I am done eating.  FYI...they DO take reservations.
