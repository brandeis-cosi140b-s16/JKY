Been looking forward to trying out this new restaurant despite a lot of negative reviews. My wife and i went in today around 2pm and they were busy. 
Had to wait about 15 minutes for a table so we went to the bar for a beer and a margarita. $18.95 for 2 drinks, ok a little pricey which now pushed my expectations to a higher level.
We both had soup, the Albondigas and their Chicken Tortilla soup were both very good, hot and flavorful. Our entrees were Carnitas Ramon and the Artichoke and Avocado burrito. portions were huge and both dishes were very good. The carnitas was very very lean. Over all the food was plentiful, and delicious. Our server was very polite and helpful. Besides being a little pricey we enjoyed our experience and will be back.
