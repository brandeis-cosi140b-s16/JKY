The first time we went here the fajitas were outstanding!  Meat was soft, tender, and flavorful....financially, it was also a great deal!  

However, the second time, which was last week, was entirely different.  We didn't order the fajita's (big mistake because I think that's really all they're known for) and ordered the sampler platter.  The food was bland, the presentation looked as if the food was slapped on the plate and then sat there for 30 minutes until the food conglomerated together.  All together, the chicken meat was tender but there was absolutely no flavor.  
-I'm sticking with those awesome fajitas next time!
_They really should invest in a pager system for customers as there's absolutely no room to stand and wait in the entrance.
