after the liquid diet we had at Wet Republic, we needed some substance. enter Diego's Happy Hour!!!! 

two words: carnitas nachos.

are you efffing kidding me? mind you, this was happy hour but the portion was pretty big. i mean, i split it with my buddy who also was coming off the liquid diet from Wet and we were both satisfied. by the food that is. it was soooo good. oh, and the complimentary chips and salsa had to be replenished. twice. the pico de gallo was surprisingly good. i think it's one of the best i've ever had actually. please, only pay me mind if you read that i was coming off a liquid diet from Wet. 

mama ordered something else and my buddy's wife order the same something. i don't remember what it was. it doesn't matter. GET THE CARNITAS NACHOS!
