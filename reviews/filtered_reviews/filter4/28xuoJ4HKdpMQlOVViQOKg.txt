Accidently found this little gem, after an afternoon of shopping.
Went in, there was a line waiting to get in, ok, this could be good.  Smelled wonderful!
It could be updated, but it was clean. I would like the music to be softer, so that we could talk without letting the other customers in on our conversation.
The food was amazing!  My friend ordered a lightly fried chimi, she devoured it.
I wanted a Shrimp Taco Salad, not on the menu, but they did it for me anyway...Thank you Seth for a great evening.
