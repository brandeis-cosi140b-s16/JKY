Great Mexican food in Central Phoenix.  I haven't been here when it's too busy, which always seems to be the case at other Upward Projects restaurants.  So I'm happy to have Joyride be my new go to.  I can find parking, get good drinks, good service, delicious tacos etc, and the best churros I've ever had.  (the cheese y mas is a must try but dangerous for the dairy intolerant)  They have a lot of open doors windows, so depending on the weather it can get a bit chilly and they keep it kinda dark.  But otherwise, we've been very happy with our dining experiences here.
