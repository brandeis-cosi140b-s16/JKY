I came here with a large group and loved how accommodating they were! We were split between two tables but we were able to hop around and speak to each other. 

The frozen margarita was super sweet but I enjoyed the smooth texture and the flavor. The fajitas were also good but definitely not the best I've had (hence the four stars)

The restaurant is close to Park Lanes bowling lanes so we ate and then walked over. 

I loved the decor and heard the tacos were amazing. The sangria was SO GOOD.
