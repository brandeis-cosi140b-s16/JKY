Now I must admit that this place holds some nostalgia for me. It is where me and my fiancé had our first date.

We have been back a few times since then and it's been okay at times, good at others. Tonight was pretty darn good. The atmosphere of this restaurant is nice especially if you get seated by the lake view tables. I have to say I was a little bit turned off that we were given dirty menus from the hostess stand. Someone was slacking. Salsa all over. But the service and food did make up for it.

We had a buy one get one free entrée coupon which was happily honored. Our waiter was very nice and kept our drinks refilled and checked in with us often. I had a cheese enchilada and a chicken flauta. My fiancé had a shredded beef and bean burrito. Both meals were very tasty. The enchilada sauce was great. The enchilada had just the right amount of cheese. 

We had a good overall experience. There may be a few other Mexican restaurants in town that are a little better but I enjoyed the food and service. I would recommend Valle Luna.
