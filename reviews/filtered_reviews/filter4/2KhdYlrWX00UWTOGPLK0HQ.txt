Ritos, where the menu was too complicated when it contained both tacos and burros, so they've ditched the tacos, for now. It's just a shack of a house in Garfield, with no signage and nowhere to sit. Who cares? It's muy good.

Rito's has its own very authentic homey style of chile sauces. You either love it, or not. Personally I love it. Most people seem to dig the green chile, but I get the same thing every time: Red Mixed (red chile and beans) Burro. This thing will explode on you. No matter how chewy and elastic the delicious tortilla is, that chile is coming out of there whenever it feels like it. For a while, I took to just turning it into a tortilla stew on the provided paper plate. But I have accepted the challenge of keeping it in burro form and am working toward the goal of containing the chile within the burro throughout the whole process. I'll update to 5 stars once I master this, or once the delicious tacos return, whichever comes first.

Harder to get to now that I've moved out of the hood, but well worth the trip each time.
