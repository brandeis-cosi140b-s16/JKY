I LOVE,  LOVE, LOVE, their food! Authentic and savory. A must for those who love REAL Mexican food.! :)

The only thing that keeps this restaurant from getting 5 stars is the location and atmosphere. Service is good and food is great so if you don't mind those 2 things than definitely try this place if you haven't already. :)
