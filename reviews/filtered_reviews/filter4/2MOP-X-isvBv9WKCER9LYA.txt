Tried this place for the first time with a couple friends for lunch on a Sunday. Had a good experience, friendly service and our waiter made several recommendations. The live music was a bonus! I  agree with other reviews on price point; however, this is not traditional Mexican food so perhaps in that viewpoint, pricing is expected? We didn't order off the Sunday brunch menu which looked to be more affordable, but everything we did order was delicious: 

Libations: The Bloody Mary was so good, not too overpowering or spicy.  The glass was rimmed with salt and what looked/tasted like sugar and crushed red pepper, not spicy at all, a nice touch.  I also tried a Michelada for the first time, another good choice! Would like to try happy hour (drinks are half off) on another visit.

Starters: The complimentary bread basket with Olive Tapenade set the tone for a non-traditional Mexican meal. But we also ordered an appetizer, the Kuali de Cameron which was my favorite. Think fancy shrimp tostadas...a large shrimp atop a roasted jalape√±o dressed with a couple of different cheeses and seasoned very well! Would like to try the guacamole raved by other yelpers next time for sure!

Main event: We ordered a couple dishes for sharing, the Tacos Cochinita Pibil (pulled pork) was very tasty; the meat was juicy and flavorful. The enchiladas suizas was traditional with the exception of chorizo crumbled on top, otherwise not really too exciting for my palate. 

Grand finale: After little debate and then a vote, we decided to go with the Flan for dessert. The flan itself was okay; however, the candied pecans and the fresh-cut strawberries on the side with Khalua cream and caramel heavily drizzled on top added more character to this dessert. There was also another distinct taste like goat cheese and when we asked the waiter he mentioned its cajetas (goat milk in the caramel sauce), all flavors blended nicely together to end a good meal :)
