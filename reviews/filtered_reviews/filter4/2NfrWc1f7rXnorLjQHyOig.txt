I really enjoyed Fuzzy's Taco shop. I ordered the special ground beef tacos. I really enjoyed the way they were seasoned and how fresh the tomatoes and herbs tasted on the taco. The atmosphere was great too. The staff was super friendly and they had great beer specials....$2 for a beer isn't bad at all. Cheap good food and cheap beer makes a great place to hangout and pregame before the game. Really enjoyed it thank you Fuzzy's.
