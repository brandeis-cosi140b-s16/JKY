My experience here was better then expected after reading some reviews while in line. I decided to give this place 4 stars because the food (sweet pork & chicken tacos) was very good overall. The tortillas & ingredients were fresh and the atmosphere was fun.  What wasn't so good was the fact that some soda choices (e.g. Root-beer) were out of syrup. The time in line waiting to order while watching them prepare food (around 15 min ) seemed too long. It was a Monday night when I stopped in, and I don't know how it is at other times but overall I would say, even though the food tastes good if you only have a couple of minutes this place may not work for you.
