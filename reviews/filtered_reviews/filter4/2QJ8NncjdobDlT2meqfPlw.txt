Surprisingly very good place! It was really crowded here. They have Top Chef masters contestants that cook here. The menu is fun with an upscale way of making Mexican food. The service was pretty friendly and we started out with the chips and salsa. The salsa wasn't very spicy. We then ordered the Guacamole and that was delicious! So addicting!

For my main dish I went with the skirt steak. It came cooked medium rare, purple refried beans, corn salsa, and flour tortillas. The meat was very good. The beans were nice as well. A good clean texture. The corn salsa was whatevers.. It didn't do it for me with the lack of sweetness. The flour tortillas didn't taste like much. 

My buddy got the carnitas plate.. OH my goodness! That was a hit. The carnitas with the cheese, beans and rice WHOOO!!! I definitely recommend getting that dish.

Recommendation:  Carnitas plate and guacamole for the chips.
