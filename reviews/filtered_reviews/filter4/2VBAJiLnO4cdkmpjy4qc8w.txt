Tortilla soup. Best thing ever. 
The prices here are not cheap, but you get big plates and a ton of food. Plus the tortilla soup. They've redone this place a few times since it opened, and right now it is at its best (they use to have an open area with round tables...horrible) but it is kind of dark, and a little cramped some days. 
They have a pretty good menu when it comes to the regular mexican dishes, and the beans and rice are awesome.
