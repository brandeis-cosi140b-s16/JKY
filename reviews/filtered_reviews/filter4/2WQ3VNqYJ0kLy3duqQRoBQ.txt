We made reservations for 10 on Sunday night after a performance at Mesa Center for the Arts.  They were all set up and ready for us.  We made it for happy hour beverages and enjoyed the chips and salsa.  There seemed to be a little confusion about who was our server.  Shortly one of the guys came over to take orders.  Food came out fairly quickly and was simple.  I had the blue seafood enchiladas which were delicious - blue corn tortillas filled with shrimp, lobster and a white fish. Everyone enjoyed their meal.  Our server split our check four ways such made paying quick and easy.  I'd recommend this restaurant for small or bigger groups.  In fact, it's a cute place for a date night!
