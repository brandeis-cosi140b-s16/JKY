This place has fantastic food!  We were surprised that it was a drive thru and an order at the counter type of place rather than a true sit-down, but the food was really great.  And they do bring the food out to you when it's ready if you order at the counter.  It has a salsa bar and the prices are very reasonable.  I had the Chile Rellenos and my fianc√© had chicken tacos, both were great!  We were in Phoenix to visit my Grandpa and grabbed dinner here on our way back to the airport.  Delicious!
