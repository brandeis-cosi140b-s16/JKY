Their queso and chips are right up there with some of the best. The guacamole is pretty outstanding as well. Margaritas are delicious but pricey. I like the tacos, but they lack seasoning. I always find myself putting salt or hot sauce on them to elevate the flavor. That alone will not keep me away from this place. Check it out for something different!
