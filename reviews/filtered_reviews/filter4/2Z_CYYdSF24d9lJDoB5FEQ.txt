Four stars on the food, it was really good and just what we were looking for. Zero stars on management however, who decided to hold a staff meeting just before the Veterans Day parade, which passed right by the restaurant. People kept trying to get bar and food service; they had a captive audience but management kept everyone tied up in the meeting and did not focus on the customers. Very short sighted of them, many unhappy people today. The two employees that were working were great, they just couldn't keep up with the demand. Message to management: Nothing is more important than customers with money in hand!
