Good:
chips and salsa
fish tacos
chicken enchilada

Not recommend:
Veggie Burrito - unless you really like that kind of stuff

The discount meal ticket prevents you from choosing things from most of the menu. It only allows for the main dishes, all of which are around $10 or much higher. I really wanted a quesadilla as my main dish but they wouldn't apply it to it since it was considered an appetizer.
