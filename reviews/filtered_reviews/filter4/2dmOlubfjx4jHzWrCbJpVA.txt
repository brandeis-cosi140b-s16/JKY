4 star food. 3 star service. 

Found this place on Yelp and went to try it a few days back.  Small place, weird parking, nice decor. 

Our server was very friendly and at the beginning everything seemed OK. We got chips and salsa, she took our order, brought our appetizer and then our meals. It seemed the food was prepared fast. Then she went to get me a drink refill and never came back. We tried hard to get her attention but nothing. 

About the food:
Not so crazy about the chips but the salsa was very tasty. Warm salsa felt funny at the beginning but we ended up liking it. 
Queso fundido was really good, came with 4 floor tortillas that were small and thin which translates to less carbs. 
I found their menu keto friendly and we liked the food, just the meat was not very tender.
