Best street tacos in Mesa hands down.  If you have been searching for some authentic tacos al carbon this is the place.  They only offer (3) meat options.  Asada (steak), Pollo (grilled chicken), and Birrea (beef).  All the meat is cooked on mesquite grills right in front of you, as well as fresh corn and flour tortillas.  Tacos cost $1.85 each which is still pretty reasonable as I've paid $3.5-$5 each at hipster taco shops in Phoenix (I.E. joyride tacos). I'm not a fan of the burritos or tostado, I would recommend the tacos or quesadilla which is like a bigger taco but with melted cheese.. I would recommend Asada Tacos for folks that are on the fence about what to order, you can't go wrong.  They have a really solid salsa bar that includes a really good Avocado based Salsa, like a thin guacamole.  Only thing I think this place is lacking is variety.  I'd love to be able to order some Tacos Al Pastor, or maybe an option for Asada Fries. But they do make excellent food.. Expect to wait 10-20 minutes in line if you come during a peak times (lunch or dinner).
