Really not sure why so many other yelpers hammer this place...  Took a quaint damsel to this fine establishment and had quite a great time. Had the Steak Fajitas, she had the chicken fajitas, both were fab and the I was really impressed with the beans and rice which were certainly above average.

The Guac seemed like it may have been processed a bit, and the salsa was good but a bit watery.  

The outside patio is nice and cozy.  I think it is pretty damm good, but I am so biased with mexican food. It is hard not for me to love it.
