Tacos El Gordo is hands down LEGIT. Just like the street tacos in TJ!!!

I would easily come back for the tasty cabeza, lengua, and adobada. These 3 are truly the stars of their menu. I mean, they're perfect. What let me down was the carne asada, which I wanted to love sooo much, but alas, it was forgettable - bland, cold, and to be honest... unappetizing. Had a bite and pushed my plate away. So sad :-(

Knocked off a star but I'm a certified fan! It's also worth mentioning that despite the huge crowd on a Friday night this place was kept clean at all times! I won't hesitate to recommend to anyone who loves authentic, no frills street tacos.
