---------Overall Verdict:
SERVICE: Client-centric and conscientious!
VENUE: Interesting interior design of passion with its warm orange/red colors and liveliness with people dancing and interacting with bulls
FOOD: Yum yum yum! Try the Veggy Tamale!
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Check-in on Yelp for free white margaritas.

VERDICT: A pretty good, last-minute alternative; I definitely recommend if you are in the Forum Shops in Vegas!

---------Experience/Venue:
Came here with a small group of 4 as a last minute dinner decision for our last night in Vegas since we found out too late that our other destination (Bacchanal Buffet) requires a few hours wait. Of course, we still tried our luck with Bacchanal, but it was a 45 minute wait around 4:45ish on a Sunday. So instead, we ended up here in Border Grill around 6:30 - and we were glad! Unlike Bacchanal, it was not crowded and we were seated immediately. Our waitress was very hospitable and helped us with recommendations. 

---------Food:
Our food came within 15 minutes which is good since we had to rush to the airport afterwards. We ordered the following:

- Border Guacamole (hass avocado, jalapeño, lime [9.50]): Not bad, but nothing to brag about. Although, at the center piece it comes with one big chip (and the rest of the chips are provided in a separate bowl).
- Crispy Potato Rajas Tacos (creamy potatoes, fire roasted chiles, mexican cheeses, guacamole, charred corn relish, chipotle crema [14]): Crispy and flavorful!
- Baja Ceviche (mexican white shrimp, sustainable catch of the day, tomato, jalapeño aioli, corn tostada [15]): Yum, yum, yum!! So flavorful! 
- Seasonal Vegetable Tamale (huitlacoche masa, melted leeks, panela cheese, roasted seasonal vegetables [14]): Very tasty! My favorite that night!
- Grilled Fish Tacos (jicama radish slaw, avocado, grapefruit, chimole [19]): I haven't yet found fish tacos that I liked, and this one didn't change my mind. (I think I should just avoid fish tacos altogether).
- Blanco Margarita (tequila blanco, agave nectar, fresh lime [44, but we were comped due to our Yelp check-in]): Very sweet, almost like lemonade, so I'm glad this was free because it was very weak, or rather, perhaps it makes sense that it was weak because it was free.
