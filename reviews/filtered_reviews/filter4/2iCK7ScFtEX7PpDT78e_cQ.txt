Anyone who wants to go here....sign me up as your arm candy.  This place was fantastic for what it is.   You can call it Mexican but its not your typical corporate-menu Mexican fare.  The menu is full of ceviches, tortas, and large aguas frescas served in ridiculously large margarita glasses.  

I rocked the "Hawaiian", my date rocked the "Mexican."   We had a little ceviche tostada on the side, washed it all down with a pina colada and found ourselves in heaven.  

They will be seeing this guy again.
