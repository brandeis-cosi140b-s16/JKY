In a good way, I was surprised by this place. 

I was expecting 'meh' food since I was on the strip and I feel like people go easy on Mexican food but I really did like it here. I had the Grilled Fish Tacos. They were great and as were the sauces that came with it. I also really like their Spicy Guacamole.

 We were a party of about 25. They didn't have a table to hold a group that big but they gave us our own section so it worked out. I'll come back if I'm near this part of the strip again!
