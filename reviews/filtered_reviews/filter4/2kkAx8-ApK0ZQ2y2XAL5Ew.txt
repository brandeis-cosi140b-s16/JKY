Really fast and convenient to go pickup window. I love the shredded beef burrito and all of the fun sides everything comes with. The rice is almost a rip off of blanco but a little more sour creamy...still yummy. The staff is always really nice and gets me out in a flash. Steer clear of the cheese crisp unless you want a giant baked Dorito. Though tempting it's not how Doritos were meant to be enjoyed
