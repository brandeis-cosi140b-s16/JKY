After all my trips to Vegas, I always wanted to try something that I could only get in Vegas, so I've steered away from Tacos El Gordo. After my drunk friends kept talking about tacos ALL NIGHT at the club, we decided to leave the club early to eat here. After leaving Encore, some of us stumbled to Tacos El Gordo to grub on some Adobada (Spicy Pork) Fries and Asada tacos. The Adobada was very good although some pieces were dry. I've had better Asada, but when it's doused in guacamole and sour cream, it'll taste x times better.
