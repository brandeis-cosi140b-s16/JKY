I've been here many times and the food never disappoints.  Is it the best mexicano food in town?  No, but it's pretty good.  I'm partial to the gyros chimichanga, which sounds bizarre but is absolutely fantastic, and the baja chimi, although the latter could use more spice in the sauce.  Overall, a nice experience, and not judgmental at all, I can come in wearing just about anything after a night out at the bars and have never had a problem.
