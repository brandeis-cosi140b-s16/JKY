I had to update this down one star because I went the other day around 10-11pm on a Thursday night and wasn't expecting it to be busy, but of course it was. I didn't mind waiting in line at all because the line was just up to the door, but the biggest problem was... the line wasn't moving for at least 15-20 minutes. I was standing in the same spot for the longest time and it didn't look like anyone's order was coming up. Usually, they can get people their food pretty quickly but not this night. Some people were complaining because each line was for different kinds of meat and so groups had to split up into the different lines so they could get carne asada, adobada, etc. and waste time going on every line. There needs to be a better system for that because if someone is by themselves on busy nights and they want different kinds of tacos, are they supposed to wait in every single line and let their food get cold? 

 I still enjoy the food here and will most likely come back but this is what I experienced recently the other night.
