WhatsaMATTA wit chu?!?

Had to write that... Now, on to business. 

I have absolutely no complaints about Mattas. Was on my way to grab a matinee viewing of a movie at Cinemark and this restaurant could not be any more convenient. 

There's a slight price reduction for 'happy hour' on the combos. $1,$2, and $3 for combos 1,2, and 3, respectfully.  I got the 2 combo with my choice of cheese enchilada and pork tamales. The cheese had amazing oooey-gooeyiness. The pork tamales was done well but it is spicy. If you don't like spicy, I would not get this.

The portions were huge and the food came out right away. There were chips and salsa while I waited (2 different salsas... I liked the chunky one!). 

Very standard Mexican preparation.  I would very much like to return to this fine establishment!
