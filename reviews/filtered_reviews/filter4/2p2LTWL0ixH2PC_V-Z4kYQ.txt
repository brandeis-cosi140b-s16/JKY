My husband and I had dinner there every single day while we were in Vegas. It was the only restaurant that was opened when we were hungry. I can't complaint. I tried for the first time the Mexican tamales there and I looked for those ever since at other Mexicans places and those are the best I ever remember. We are going back for his bday and we will go back there again to try it out once more. I just hope everything is as I remember it.
