came for sunday brunch. their brunch menu is a all you can eat tapas style for $25, $30 with champagne mimosas. they had a large selection to choose from with lots of vegetarian option. each small plate was enough for 2 people.

their staff is friendly and very attentive. the food was excellent. the french toast just melted in your mouth. and the meats (brisket and steaks) were so tender and great cuts of meat. they did charge 50 cents for a bottle of karafe water (which i think was tap) so i thought that was a little weird but its just 50 cents. i also kinda wished there was more of a view. we sat outside by the beach pool so we just saw the gated fence. oh well. i'd come back again for the great food and friendly service.
