Why haven't I been here sooner?!?! My aunt was visiting from out of state and we decided to do lunch I told her there was a cool looking Mexican joint in the quarter that I hadn't tried yet so we decided to give it a shot. Very nice decor and ambience...very "old world modern". Our server was very nice and explained everything to us since it was our first time. I got the blackberry ginger marg...delishh :) we got coconut calamari for the app and each got tacos. My aunt was super pleased and I found my new Mexican spot...even though I wanna go back mainly for the calamari!
