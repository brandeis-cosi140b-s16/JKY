Can't believe you only have 3 reviews, what's wrong with people, there were tons of them when I ate there last night!!! lol

I brought in a group of movie goers from Harkins, we saw Eat Pray Love, and the experience was top notich!

Attentive staff, tasty food (I had chicken fajitas), and strong drinks :) (had strawberry margarita), and dynamic company made for a most enjoyable experience. 

No idea where your 2.5 star weighed average rating came from, my guess is those who reviewed you were perhaps inebriated when they wrote it ? :)

See you soon,
Matthew
