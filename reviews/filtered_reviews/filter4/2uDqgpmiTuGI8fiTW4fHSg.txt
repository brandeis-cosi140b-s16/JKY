My fianc√©e and I ordered the When Pigs Fly (siao pao), chips and salsa, Ji Song lettuce wraps.  They were great. The chips and salsa were spicy but not extremely spicy which we prefer. The salsa wasn't your average Mexican restaurant/Ralph's salsa either. The lettuce wraps were tasty but they only gave four of them.  I'd be nice to have six. For desert we had the Mango Sticky Rice whose name is misleading because it's basically a Rice Krispie desert with whip cream (coconut cream I think). Our waitress gave a good description for the Chocolate Tera Cotta Warrior dessert. Will probably get that the next time we're here. Great service and decor.
