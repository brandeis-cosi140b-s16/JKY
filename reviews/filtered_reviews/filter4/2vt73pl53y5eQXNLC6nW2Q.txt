The food is consistently good. I've been many times and always, always. always love what I order.  Be it the tacos, guac, ceviche, salad or dessert it's all a taste explosion in your pie-hole.

What isn't consistent is the service.  It goes from being exceptional to unfriendly and cold.  There are a couple of really great servers there that actually engage with you and smile, then there are the others who are either grumpy or just playing it really cool.  Ugh.

It's a minor annoyance out weighed by the deliciousness.  I heart GB.
