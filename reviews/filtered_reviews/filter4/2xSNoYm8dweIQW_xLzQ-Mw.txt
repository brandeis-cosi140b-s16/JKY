I never knew this place existed when I lived in Phoenix, but on a recent visit to relatives we were taken there and I was quite happy with the quality of food. Maybe my tastes are "off" due to living in upstate NY for a year and no longer knowing the joy of good Mexican food, but I thought it was darned tasty. The entrees we got were all good, and even the chips and salsa they place on the table is good.

The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because I thought the service, while quick and efficient, was cold and impersonal. The server was sitting at the bar and chatting with someone rather than attending to our table most of the time, and when he finally dropped off the check, he didn't tell us it's meant to be taken up to the front. I don't mind doing that, but I don't like restaurants that leave you guessing as to whether the server will be your cashier or not.

So... remember to take your check to the front yourself.
