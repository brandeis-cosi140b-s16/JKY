I can appreciate a good happy hour, and Cien Agaves certainly has a muy bueno one.

While I didn't come on Taco Tuesday (which I should have for their $1 tacos and $2 Tecates), I did come for Margarita Monday (ok, I made that up - margaritas here are a must every day of the week). We came in before their daily happy hour ended at 7pm and enjoyed some awesome house margies for half price - $3.50! And these suckers were pretty big too. 

Food was delicioso. I had a carnitas burrito and went with our server's rec to get it enchilada style and got the spicy red sauce. I'm glad I did, because it was so good wet (hmm, TWHS). Their signature chicken fajitas were really tasty as well. Entrees were so big that I couldn't imagine getting any appetizers or dessert - although an after dinner shot of tequila? Si, senor! Obviously, they had a list of cien tequilas on their menu. As much as I love Clase Azul, we decided to get shots of Milagro Anejo and saved ourselves $400.

All in all, a fun spot in Old Town Scottsdale to get your Mex fix!
