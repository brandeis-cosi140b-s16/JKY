Went here for the first time on Sunday night and even though there were two large parties we well taken care of and received our orders in a timely manner. I appreciate a place that has great chips and different salsas of varying heat. So many other Mesa/Gilbert Mexican restaurants bland it up for the snow birds but the food was great and the place was new and clean (yeah it did look like a Scottsdale "art" gallery but who cares).
