This is my local Mexican restaurant I go to on a regular basis. It's difficult to find right now due to the light rail construction. If you miss the temporary entrance, turn around and go back.  Service is always excellent. Food is always spectacular. Only four stars because I want the kitchen and wait staff to have some room to grow.
