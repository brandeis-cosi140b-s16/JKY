My girlfriend and I wanted to try this place every time we walked by. We ended up feeling a bit hungry in between meals (we were going to go from 1-9PM without eating) so we dropped in for a snack. We had a tuna something that was the special for the week. I'm not a big tuna fan, but it was pretty decent. The dessert was great, though. We ordered the bread pudding, also a special. It wasn't like any other bread pudding I've ever had. Definitely a lot more cinnamon present in the preparation. I was also glad that it didn't have raisins! All in all, a pretty good choice for a quick snack. I can't wait to go to have a full meal. If this visit was indicative of the level of service and quality of food, the full meal should be wonderful.
