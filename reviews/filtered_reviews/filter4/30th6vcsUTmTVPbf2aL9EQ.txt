I have been here twice so far for lunch
The first time was very unremarkable
I had a taco and the shell was hard and the meat wasn't anything to write home about 
The chips & salsa weren't great as well 

My first visit really wasn't what I expected

However 

My second time went very well
We were seated on arrival and our server was very prompt 
We received water as well as chips & salsa within seconds of sitting down...
I wanted to try one of their margs and our wonderful server suggested the watermelon rhubarb one so I took her advice 
After looking at the menu I decided on the award winning BBQ pork tacos with rice and beans 
The tacos and beans were wonderful
I should've asked what kind of rice it was going to be as I am not a big fan of creamy rice... I left that on the plate... And devoured everything else... 
The margarita was tasty and really hit the spot because it was about 109 that day and I needed something to cool me off 
The flavor of watermelon and hint of lime was excellent...

All in all I enjoyed Blanco and look forward to visiting again perhaps at the Biltmore location... 

Thank you to the wonderful server for making this visit enjoyable and resurrecting
