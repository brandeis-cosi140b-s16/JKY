Food is average but hot diggitty THE MILKSHAKES!

We came here for a casual lunch, but everything that we ate was completely overshadowed by the angelic elixir that is The Stand's Dulce de Leche milkshake. They serve this delicacy equipped with a giant straw which is AWESOME! If they had an intravenous option, I would go with that. This is the milkshake you have been waiting for!

As for the food, we had a cheeseburger, the pork taco, the chicken taco, fries, and chips with guac. The food was "eh". It's like a Honda Civic. Will it get you where you need to go? Yes. Are you rushing to the dealership to buy one after winning the lottery? Probably not. Good enough for lunch but probably won't come back for food. Just more heaven in a cup with a giant straw. 

Staff was cool, ambiance was relaxed, patio was weird and cool. Check out The Stand for a milkshake. They are bomb.com
