Review #700, I'm taking it on the road! Canonita is well worth the trip. Of course, if you're staying at The Venetian, it's as close as the gondolas. 

Came here for a party and was delighted from the word 'Go'. Mind you, I kinda stopped with the Mexican food thing because it's so often so mediocre (and that's in any city). And, truly, not the healthiest. But Canonita blew up both of my prejudices.

* Margaritas. Yes, very tasty and potent without knocking me over. Enjoyed the balance of sweetness to citrusy tartness. Mmm. (And they gave us cups for when we later taxi'd off to Karaoke.)
* Chips and guac. The chips were tasty, with just enough crisp and just enough salt, and certainly no oily residue. The guacamole was damn good -- thick and tasty, without a lot of mysterious ingredients. Straightforward and delish. 
*Filet Mignon was my choice (could have also gone for Salmon or a chicken dish). Lovely 8 oz I think was the weight. Don't bother requesting a temp for your meat, because the kitchen really doesn't think know what's best. Happily, we were of the same mind in term of heat: Medium Rare and loving it. Wonderful flavors that I frankly can't recall (I mentioned the margaritas, right?). If you at all interested in steak, this is a worthy choice for your entree.

I must say the dessert was fine, but anticlimactic. Really not necessary. However, I did have a brownie sundae which definitely didn't hurt anything - except maybe my waistline.

Service was pleasant and attentive without being all over us. Water was refilled as necessary, which for me, is fairly often. 

Overall, I was most surprised that the Yelp reviews seemed so unenthusiastic. I would absolutely recommend Canonita, and if you do sit 'outside' by the gondolas, you don't even notice them. Gracias! Muchas gracias!
