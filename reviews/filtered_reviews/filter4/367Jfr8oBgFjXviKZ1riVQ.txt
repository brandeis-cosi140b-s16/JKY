I can't speak for the food or mixed drinks! 

I went with a few friends for my 1st time around midnight on a Friday! 
Music was very good, crowd seemed very cool, loved the indoor/outdoor setup, beers weren't insanely priced like Chicago Club type settings, Vibe was great. No cover charge.
A place I'd go back to until convinced otherwise. 
Felt very comfortable with the age group there. Seemed like 20s and 30s.
