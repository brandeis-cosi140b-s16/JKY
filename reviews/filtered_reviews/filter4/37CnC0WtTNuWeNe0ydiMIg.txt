Whenever we are in the mood for Mexican food and we're anywhere near the strip, we always hit up El Segundo. The food is great. Try the guacamole - it's made at your table. The chips and salsas are great and the fish tacos are to die for. At night, when it's warm, you can sit out on the patio, with trees (fake) and white Christmas lights dangling. It's a great atmosphere directly across the street from the Wynn Hotel with a good view of the strip.

The best way to access this restaurant is to park at the Fashion Show Mall then walk through the mall to the front of the restaurant.

Even though it might look busy, there isn't usually much of a wait time because the restaurant is surprisingly large on the inside.
