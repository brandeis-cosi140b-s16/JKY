As I understand it, Leticia's recipes come from her mother's kitchen in Mexico City.  That definitely explains some of the great tastes found here.

Chips and Salsa start the meal, like almost every Mexican Restaurant here in Las Vegas.  That is not the case in the places I have been in Mexico... but I'm a fan anyways.  And Letecia gives you three dip choices...  A traditional salsa, salsa verde, and bean dip.  All are excellent, though my favorite is the bean dip. 

The entree's are excellent.  They boast a variety of creative tacos that will really get your tasebuds firing.  But I was all about the mole poblano on this trip.  Now I have had some great mole's in Mexico and every one is different from the next.  Here in the states, most places get too caught up on the "chocolate" part.  In reality several Mole's don't even include chocolate and those that rank among the best in Mexico don't emphasize the chocolate.  The sauce has dozens of ingredients.  I was really excited to try Leticia's.  Unfortunately, it came across too chocolate for me.  This will probably appeal to a lot of people... but not me.  Everything else was great and all my party enjoyed their food.  It was all excellent.... but I just didn't care for the mole.

Topping off your meal with fresh Churo's is a nice nod to Mexican street food and truly delicious.

The service was excellent and the restaurant is clean and inviting.  I like Leticia's a lot!  I will be back often for the tacos and enchiladas... but not for the mole poblano.  I am glad to have a great Mexican restaurant in an area that is starving for restaurants.  I hope Leticia's sticks around.  

Give it a try!
