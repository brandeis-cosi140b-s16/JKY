The servers are pretty knowledgeable about gluten free options on the menu... and if they are new the kitchen staff is more than happy to help.  I've had the nachos there, which have to be baked and have a differing cheese placed on them ( the cheese is mixed with beer and the friers are not dedicated).  However, they were very nice in accommodating me on these slightly crazy requests in my quest for nachos.  They werent the best or most crispy nachos, but it was nice to have with a great margarita.  
Very interesting atmosphere and decorations.
