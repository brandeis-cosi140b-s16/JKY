So Miquel's is definitely a perfect definition for a "Hole in the Wall" but let's be honest those places clearly have the best food. 

As a self proclaimed Mexican fanatic I was excited to see just what this place had to offer. 

We started with the chips and salsa and they were classic. The chips were warm and crispy and the salsa had just the right amount of kick! 

My friends and I ordered a little bit of everything...fajitas, shrimp quesadillas, tacos, rice and beans. 

Everything was delicious...and the portion sizes were perfect! Add to that good service and super reasonable prices! I'm absolutely coming back.
