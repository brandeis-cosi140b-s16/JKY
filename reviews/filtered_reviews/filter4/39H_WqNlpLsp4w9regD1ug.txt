Red Chile Burro, Enchilada Style. 
DONE AND DONE!

Show up on Saturday or Tuesday and you MIGHT be blessed with tacos made by Nana. I've been coming here for 5 years (which makes me a newbie) and while at first I thought the burros were a bit off in the red chile/tortilla ratio, you won't forget the flavor of the red chile. One morning, you'll wake up after a night of too much fun and CRAVE Rito's.

Family owned and operated this little gem is worth the weight (and wait) in gold. Just don't forget...cash only!
