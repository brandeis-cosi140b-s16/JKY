Had dinner on Saturday  night right before MJ show at Mandalay. I had the wagyu beef tacos, marinated and grilled pineapple,  flavor reminded me of the best AL pastor tacos but not pork. Very good. Wife and I shared some raja tacos & guacamole.  Very fresh & chunky. Wife had tortilla soup. Incredible broth and roasted chili flavors. 

Only think I didn't like was the Paloma drink special,  had zero grapefruit flavor. The food had so much attention  to flavors, texture & colors but the drink was prepared poorly.

Fresh strawberry lemonade was one of the best we've had though.
