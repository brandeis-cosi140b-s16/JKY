Eaten here a few times (7th street-Coronado district). I can say the place is small but has a cozy feel to it. It's an old converted house to restaurant. 

The food is a little pricey considering the portions are not huge (like Filiberto's or Carolina's (Extra Yummy). But the food was decent. 

I've eaten the Vampiro, Carne Asada Burrito, Chips n Guac/Salsa, and America's corn (yummy!!). My eyes are always bigger than my stomach :).  I will say that the last time I did get the corn, it was a little under-cooked. So it was a little harder to chew...but regardless, it was still good. Smothered with mayo, butter, and cojita cheese I think...how can you go wrong with all of that yummy-ness!!

I would visit this place again, if I am down in that area. They also allow you to order online which I think is cool because that line gets very long very quick.
