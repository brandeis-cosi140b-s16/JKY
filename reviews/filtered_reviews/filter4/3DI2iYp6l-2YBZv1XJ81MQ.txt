A group of 13 of us went on a Sunday afternoon. This place was packed! While we waited outside there was a person selling micheladas. Very much needed after a night of partying and waiting in the heat. We waited for about 15 minutes before we were seated. The service was good considering how busy it was. This is a perfect spot to hang out with friends, enjoy live music and eat good sea food. 

It's about a 15 minute drive from the Vegas strip.
