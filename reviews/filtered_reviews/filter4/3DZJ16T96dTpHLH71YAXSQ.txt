I had the Booze Burger after seeing it on the show. It wasn't on the normal menu, but you can still ask for it. The idea of the burger is quite interesting. It was good, but not sensational. The Sweet Potato Tater Tots were good with the Chipotle Ketchup. I'd go back, but I'd try something else on the menu.
