I am basing this review on 1 visit. The service was pretty good. The atmosphere was pretty good. The food.......Let me start out by saying I am picky about Mexican food.  I grew up in a very Hispanic neighborhood. I know good Mexican food. While the salsa was very tasty, the chips weren't my favorite. The were very thick and a little greasy. My wife ordered the Carne Asada burrito. I tasted it and thought it was pretty good. They do however use whole black beans. Refried beans aren't even on the menu. By now you may be wondering why 4 stars.......The Arizona burrito is the absolute bomb!!! It was one of the best green chili burros I have ever had. It was not too spicy, but the flavor was phenomenal. I hope that was not a fluke because I have been craving it ever since.
