Came here with friends to have a quick dinner.  Note:  Make a reservation if you plan to go here Saturday night!  The wait was crazy long but luckily we were able to sit at the bar.  I didn't really know what kind of food was served here so I wasn't put off by the fact that they didn't serve Mexican/Chinese fusion like some of the other reviewers.  

We ordered: 

1) Chips and Salsa - Nothing special, but they were good
2)  Carnitas Tacos - Tasty, moist, and messy...for me at least.  i liked the pork grind.
3) Gan Pung Ji Chicken - It was the best fried chicken I had in a while!  I really liked the spicy chili sauce the most!
4) Sui Mai, Beef with lime/daikon/watermelon radish - It was good, but nothing to write home about. :)
5) Mango rice pudding dessert (I can't remember the name) - This was really yummy!  We ordered another dessert with a chocolate figurine on top of ginger ice cream, but this one was waaaaaaaaaaaaaay better.


This place is a little on the pricy side for Mexican and Chinese food, so you have been warned.

I'd come back here again but just not on a Saturday night.
