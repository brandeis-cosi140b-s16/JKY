OrderTheFusion!
See what happened there? KoMex is so good that is makes you type in fusion. I mean it when I say you should ignore all items on the menu that aren't fusion love children.
I also mean it when I say add kimchi to everything.
And I extra-double-super-hybrid-sir-mix-a-lot mean it when I say ask for the hot sauce carousel. The chunky Korean spicy salsa alone is worth the visit.
Also, be careful when searching for this tragically named establishment on your phone. It will autocorrect to Kotex.
