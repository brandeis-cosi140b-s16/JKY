My boyfriend and I went here as part of a pre-birthday celebration while we were staying at Mandalay Bay. We had made a reservation for 830 and were seated immediately when we arrived. They brought us drinks right away and the margaritas were pretty strong, which was great. We ordered enchiladas, a steak quesadilla, chips and guac and some sort of pork appetizer. All of it was really good. We also mentioned to the waiter that it was my birthday  tomorrow and they brought out a complimentary Mexican chocolate cake, which was a nice touch. I definitely would recommend for a casual dinner or lunch if you are staying at Mandalay.
