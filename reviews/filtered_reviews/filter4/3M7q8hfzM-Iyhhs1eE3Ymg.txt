Tucked away in the back of the Bally's is the rarely crowded Tequila Bar.  Popular for the $2 tequila shots, $3 draft beers and cheap tacos that people stumble in to chug back before heading out to the casino floor or night club, often overlooked are the stellar entrees.  Sure, you're going to pay full price, but they make it worth it.  Especially delectable is the carne asada plate.  Marinated just right, slathered with chimichuri and cheese, it is among the best out there.  The carne asada sits atop a savory plate of black beans, lime seasoned rice and sweet plantains.  For desert, skip the cheap Jose Cuervo swill and ask the bartender for a good tequila recommendation; you won't be disappointed.
