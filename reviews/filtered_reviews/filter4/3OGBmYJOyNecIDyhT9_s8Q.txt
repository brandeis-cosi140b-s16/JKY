5 stars for the SPICY PORK taco. 1 stars for the carne asada.

Wow, the spicy pork taco is the best dish here.  It was definitely similar to some tacos I had in Ensenada! Good thing I read Nelson Q. and Misti Y.'s review before I got there because requesting pineapples was the best thing that happened to this taco. I also like the grilled jalepenos and grilled green onions. I'd say their hot sauce (both red and green) were tasty but I didn't need them for the spicy pork taco.

On the other hand, the carne asada (beef) tacos and carne asada fries were a bust. The meat had a weird taste to it. I'm exaggerating but I felt like I could taste the cow, the soil it was farmed on, its dung, and maybe its odor when it was alive. The beef was also very fatty that I had to spit it out onto a napkin a few times. As for the carne asada fries, everything was good but the meat pretty much ruined it. Next time, I'm getting the adobada (spicy pork) fries.

Service: The worker at the grill spit was very friendly and laughed at me when I said I wanted pineapples "tambien." The cashier girls were very efficient and they were fluent in English. While we were eating, one of the employees would come by and clean up our emptied plates which was helpful because the tables are way too small for the amount of food we got. 

This is officially my favorite Mexican spot in Vegas. It's worth the 20 minute drive from Henderson. I'm so happy!
