Pretty good.  Pretty good.  I got a lunch combination with the standard stuff (taco, enchilada, and tamale).  I wasn't a fan of the tamale.  It was too dried out.  The taco and enchilada were really good.  It says that everything is made in house.  It's a shame that  I won't be able to return too soon since I'm rarely in the Phoenix area, which may be a good thing in itself.
