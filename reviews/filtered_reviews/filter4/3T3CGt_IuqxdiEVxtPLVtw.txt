Taco Tuesday is my one of my main reasons for living. They have an amazing happy hour on Tuesday where tacos are $2 and house margaritas are $3.50. If you need a good place to be obnoxious and talk shit, this is the place as it is LOUD. During their rush, service can be kind of slow and you have to ask for free chips and salsa to be delivered to your table. (I am of the mind that all restaurants, Mexican food or no Mexican food, should serve free chips and salsa. But I digress.) 

For the price and the location, you can't beat it. Thank you Cien Agaves for helping me tolerate the rest of  my work week after getting drunk on your extremely cheap and tasty margaritas on Tuesdays.
