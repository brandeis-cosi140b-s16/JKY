In 2011, I think I am going to be a bit more "tough" in my reviews.  So, consider this four star rating a very good rating.  After moving from Dallas, I have not adjusted well to the Mexican food of Phoenix.  Nothing matched the Tex-Mex (not surprising), and every place people told me to go seemed to lack flavor.  Well.... the Spotted Donkey hit the spot (hehe).  It is not Tex-Mex more Southwestern/Mexican but the really important fact is the food is delicious and full of flavor.  Margaritas are better than tasty.  The restaurant sophisticated but very comfortable with a back and front patio-- both with fireplaces.  We had the nachos as a appetizer at the recommendation of wise yelpers.... very good.  Prices here a very fair, it looks like happy hour is a great deal.  I look forward to another visit soon!
