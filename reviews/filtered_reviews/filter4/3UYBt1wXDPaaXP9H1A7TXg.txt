Always have a good time with friends here but it might be because I drink a lot.. Gets super busy around weekends but weekdays are usually no problem. Do not be afraid to sit around the bar if hungry during busy time as the servers there are really good. If you like to drink the Chambord Margarita is amazing and a must try.
