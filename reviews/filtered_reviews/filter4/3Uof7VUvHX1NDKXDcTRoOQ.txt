For being located inside The Venetian, on the Canal, this place is pretty awesome.  

$5 Happy Hour Margaritas.  $3 for Chips and Salsa and $8 for Chips, Salsa and Guac!  For this "neighborhood" that is a DEAL!

The food was all very fresh and tasted great.  The cilantro rice has a really great fresh taste to it.  My wife and I both had enchiladas ($18 I think).  They were really tasty and it was really nice to be able to have a meal for less than $50+.

I definitely recommend this place and will go there again next time I'm there.
