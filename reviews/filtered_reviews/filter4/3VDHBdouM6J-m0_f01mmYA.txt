Food was very fresh tasting and well seasoned. We really enjoyed the Baja ceviche. I had lunch with my daughter and she didn't know what that was and our server( Sarah) wad very helpful. She was very good at explaining the items on the menu. My daughter had the skirt steak, it was so delicious! I had the Yucatan pork which was good but the steak was way better! I had a Cadillac Margarita that was really good! It is pricey but it is delicious! 
We did have a dessert it was like a tres leche churro minis, it was terrible! Do Not Order! It sounds delicious but this kind of restaurant should never let it leave the kitchen. The churro's were not crispy and the filling wasn't even in the them anymore. That was my only complaint.
