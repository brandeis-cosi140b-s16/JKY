Both the interior and the exterior are beautiful
The hostess was super upbeat and sat us in a matter of seconds
Our server was just OK
I could rate less on the serving aspect of my visit but I'm a nice person
He wasn't horrible but he was a little slow 
For lunch I got the Taco Plate
The Taco Plate consists of 3 tacos and a side
I went with the Al Pastor Pork, the Grilled Seasonal Veggie, and the Chipotle Cherry Steak...
While all were good, my favorite was the Al Pastor Pork
It had such good flavor and the toppings complimented the meat very well
My recommendation: The Al Pastor

Also, they have great deals on drinks during Happy Hour
