Best House Margarita in town, hands down. Honestly, I've tried to duplicate their tangy concoction a few times--the waitstaff says it's the standard stuff--I'm convinced they let the lime juice go a little bad to make it tangy. Call me crazy. Doesn't matter how they make it though, cause that shit's fantastic and it keeps me coming back. 

Can't remember their food too much. I mostly just remember that their vegetarian options are sparse or less-than-exciting.

If you've not been to OTTF, make sure to sit outside; you're wasting your time if you end up inside.

BTW, I've only dumped ice from the margarita tumbler all over the table once. Woohoo!
