I've been here twice now, once for my birthday back in November when it was freeeezing, and then the other day for lunch. Vastly different experiences! For dinner at night in November, we couldn't sit outside which was a shame, because when I went for lunch it was a beautiful day and seems like such a fun place to grab a margarita and some chips with friends. I've tried the fish tacos which were just alright, but I was actually blown away by the chicken burrito with green salsa. (Forgive my complete lack of Spanish speaking and translation ability). I've never ordered a chicken burrito in my life, carne asada all the way. But this was huge, the chicken was tender, and I was most impressed by the salsa on top. It was super tangy and fresh, and had tons of lime and herbs. 

Free chips and salsa, yummy guac, and the guava margarita is pretty good. Prices are a bit above average.
