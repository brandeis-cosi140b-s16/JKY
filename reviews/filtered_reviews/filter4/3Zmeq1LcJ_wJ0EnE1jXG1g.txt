We had dinner here on a packed Thursday night. The decor and ambiance is top notch. The food was interesting and very good overall. We had to wait a long, long time between courses but the friendly waiter, Sam, made it right by not charging us for several items. Yes, the guacamole was good but a little small for $12. The chips were delicious but needed salt, which we had to ask for. Unfortunately we filled up on the chips and dip before our chicken and scallop mini tacos were served. The pork lettuce wraps were small but very tasty. I told our waiter when we first sat down that I was a big fan of grits and he said could get both types with my order but it never came. When I mentioned it at the end of our meal, he quickly brought me a tiny taste of the honey grits (no charge) which were spicy and sweet and a little strange. It probably would have tasted better if I had tried it before I was so full. Ditto for the pumpkin banana bread pudding, which was huge. I left feeling over stuffed and sick, which is something I never, ever do. I would go back but I would order less food and just stick to one dish along with the guacamole and bread pudding.
