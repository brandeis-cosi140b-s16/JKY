I was in Tempe for a meeting and my hosts had taken me out for Italian and then Chinese food.  Having lived in Europe for the past six years I wanted Mexican for my last nights meal.  I googled "Best Mexican food in Phoenix" and the Barrio Caf√© came up as #1.   We piled into the car and went.

The restaurant seems to be in a working-class area with a mix of residences and businesses There is parking out back and the exterior walls are painted with bold, slightly cultural graffiti paintings.  Baron Samedi is there, not sure why, and various skull-themed portraits.  There is a patio where you can have a drink while you wait for your table.  The view onto N 16th St is nothing to look at but if you order one of their signature Margueritas you won't care.  They are delicious.  As I was not driving and the meeting was over, I sampled a couple.  Some have fruit juices like pomegranate or chambord.  This is not traditional Mexican fare.  It's Mexican with some creative license.

I had a roasted corn salad dressed with a goats milk cheese and subtle flavorings.  Delicious.  For dinner I had a slow cooked suckling pig that had been wrapped in banana leaf.  It was quite good although looking at the plates of my colleagues I think I might have switched to one of their plates.  They loved their food.

Happy to have gone and would go again.
