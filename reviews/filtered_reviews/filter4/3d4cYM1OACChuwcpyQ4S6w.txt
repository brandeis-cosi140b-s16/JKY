This place has been around forever, and while I don't ever remember eating here before, my dad assured me that I had. The place is no frills on the outside, but has a quaint charm to it on the inside.  The chips and salsa were really good, the salsa was very fresh.  We got a cheese crisp to start, and it was definitely a good version.  Before we could even finish it our food started coming out of the kitchen.  My sister and I both ordered Combo #10 which included a shredded beef taco and a red or green cheese enchilada, we both chose red. Like a typical Mexican restaurant, our plates came out piping hot with the standard "Don't touch, the plate is very hot" warning from our waiter.

First things first, I took a forkful of beans and held it up, I could see the steam rising from them, I took the bite and was immediately in heaven! These are the beans that I have been searching for!!! They were so creamy and delicious, and had just enough cheddar cheese sprinkled on top....I could have seriously just had a plate of the beans and been happy!  I took a bite of the enchilada, I really liked the enchilada sauce, it had wonderful flavor and there was not too much cheese to where that was all you could taste, it was an excellent enchilada. I then tried the taco; the shell was crisp and filled with the shredded meat, lettuce, cheese and tomatoes. It was really good, the meat was not the best shredded beef I have ever had, but all the components together made it a taco that I would order again.

My dad loved the chile relleno con carne, he said it was a good version, and one of the best that he had had recently.

I decided I definitely needed to add La Fonda into my rotation, if only for the beans alone!
