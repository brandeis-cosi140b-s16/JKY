I was in Phoenix on a one day business trip and found this place on yelp. I'm glad I did. The restaurant is small at first but has a variety of home made salsas at the salsa bar. I didn't get a chance to try them all but the ones I had were very good. They have really good service with a friendly server and prompt service. I had the mahi fish taco which was grilled and I also had the chicken taco. Both were excellent with the rice and beans. They give you soft drinks in a to go cup so that was convenient to take with me in the 100 degree weather. 

The food was really good and was better than similar tacos in CA. I'm glad I chose this place for my one meal in AZ before my flight home! One more thing the price was very reasonable and the location was only a couple miles from the Sky Harbor rental car center. Will go back if I'm in AZ.
