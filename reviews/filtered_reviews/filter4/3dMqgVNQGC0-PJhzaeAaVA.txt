This place was surprisingly good! I usually enjoy a nicer atmosphere, but for the amazing flavors of their food, it was worth it. They are the only place to have chilaquiles in Charlotte. I tried it in Mexico and have been craving it ever since. La Unica's was really good. Thank you guys! The shrimp quesadilla's are really good too! It is nice to practice my Spanish, and the servers are always happy to speak it right back. They are so nice. Muchos gracias!
