Went last night... had the fish tacos while my husband got the machaca burrito.  Both were awesome.... the fish tacos were super yummy and I'm a big fan of the rice.  It's kind of more modern... definitely not your traditional mexican restraurant.  The service was decent but nothing to rave about.  All in all we'll probably be back in the future.
