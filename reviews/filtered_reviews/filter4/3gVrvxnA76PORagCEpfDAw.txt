This place has a great atmosphere and is something unique. It resembles a mining cave on the inside, and the outside has a really cool patio with a big waterfall and pool. We sat in the dining area surrounding the bar and got great service. The waitress was very attentive and you could tell she really liked her job and was knowledgeable about the entire menu. The chips and salsa were really good. The chips were a variety of white, red and blue corn with a light dusting of spices. The salsas were chunky and very tasty. They bring you red and green, and are nothing like what you get around town. Very good. I ordered the filet mignon tacos, which came topped with cheese, pico, and guacamole on flour tortillas. They were delicious. My husband got the open faced green chili hamburger which was smothered with their green chili sauce and cheese. It was amazing. 

We of course ordered drinks. My husband got  his usual beer, and I tried the skinny margarita. It was awesome and reminded me of what an authentic margarita should taste like. I also got the sangria and it was good. Not as sweet as what I normally expect though.

We will definitely go here again with our son this time as they have a kids menu. It's not a stuffy Scottsdale restaurant and has character and awesome food!
