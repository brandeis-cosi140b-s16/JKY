Places seem to come and go at this location I missed the last one.  came like the day after it shut its doors so I wasn't going to be left out this time.  Glad I went,  Had the Stand Cheeseburger, fries and a Banana Shake it was all good.(Love the HUGE straws) looking forward to making it back to try some of those Tacos!!  

Lets see if we can keep this place going and break that bad location mojo.
