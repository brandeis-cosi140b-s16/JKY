Who would have thought Asian-Latin fusion would work so great? Tamarind in pad thai? This place was great! I was so interested in the menu that I wanted to try everything! The hostess' were a little subpar, hence the 4 stars and told us an hour wait when tables opened up 10 minutes after we sat at the bar, but the wait staff was awesome. If it's your first time here, just ask and they'll have excellent recommendations. For drinks, try the Kumquat! A fresh drink after a hectic day for sure. I would highly recommend the Pork "Al Pastor" Pad Thai! It was absolutely delicious and plenty, even enough for two if your so inclined! It was a wonderful fusion between the Asian/Latin menu this place offers!
