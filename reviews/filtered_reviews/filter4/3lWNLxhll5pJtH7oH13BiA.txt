Love taco Tuesday here. They have the best shredded beef tacos in town. Well close to town. The atmosphere is good, the service is great, and my wif and I always love coming here. It's kind of a drive from where we live but always worth it. I would give this place 5 stars if it weren't  for that drive. I also wish lake las vegas would get it together and find a way make the area work.
