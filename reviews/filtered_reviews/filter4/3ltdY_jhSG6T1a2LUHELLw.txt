The service was efficient, the restaurant was well-designed and clean, and the food was fresh and tasty. The pollo asado burrito was very tasty, especially the melted crema and Oaxaca cheese!  The guac was decent, nothing special, but good. The salsa was fantastic, perfect blend of spices and not too chunky. I would come here again
