I don't know what all the complaining about the service is about, but we had excellent service at the bar. Margarita coupon on their website and it was a good even blend. I had the enchiladas, which came three on a plate and chose one of each: chicken, pork, cheese. Talk about perfect portions - they were not too big, not too small, perfect amount of zesty red sauce, thick and chewy tortillas, and came with delicious beans and a scoop of rice. There are other dinners on the menu that I am very interested in trying (garlic shrimp, anyone?). It's a nice, cozy spot, good for small groups of friends or a date.
