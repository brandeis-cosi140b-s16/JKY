I've been here a few times now, probably 6-7 in the past year. I've enjoyed every encounter, both dining in and take out.

No its not modern. It doesn't have a unique take on the Mexican food. It won't win any awards.

But it's as close to Mexican comfort food as it gets, and I love it. IT reminds me of growing up in Phoenix, and all of the family started Mexican restaurants all over the valley. Simple and filling. 

The service has always been great, everyone  who works there seems genuinely glad you came.

I'm a simple man. That's good enough for me.
