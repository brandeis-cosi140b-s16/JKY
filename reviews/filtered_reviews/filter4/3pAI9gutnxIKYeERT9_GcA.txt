We enjoyed our outdoor patio meal so much two weeks ago we decided to return for more of the same last night. Unfortunately, the weather wasn't as cooperative second time around but the meal and service didn't fail to live up to prior expectations. 

Things are a bit more crowded and noisy in the restaurant than out (and even though we'd dined inside once before a couple of years ago, we hadn't realized there's an additional patio area to the rear of the establishment) so in order to have conversation with our friends we did have to raise our speaking voices a good deal to be heard over the volume of the large size bar and Friday night crowd but seemed to quickly adjust. Our server appeared quickly, gave us a warm welcome and reviewed our options, including The Mission's signature drinks and table side guacamole.  As an aside - two weeks ago we decided upon medium spiciness but it packed a punch; this time we scaled back to mild and it was perfect for a delicate palate. Server was very attentive to providing more chips as soon as we made our way through the dip. 

My husband knew he wanted to save room for dessert so ordered steak tacos which were limited to about three small but favorable slightly-bigger than bite size tacos; I selected my favorite: jhidori chicken; tender, succulent chicken slices spread over rice  with two flavorful sauces. Desert was their flavorful churros and one serving was actually enough to be shared four ways. 

Parking can be challenging in Old Towne but it's worth a little extra walk to go the distance for a gastronomic experience at The Mission.
