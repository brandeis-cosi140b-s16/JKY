My husband and I went here a few days ago and we were happy with what we ordered. We came in to have a late lunch (2pm) and it was confusing at first to figure out how to order. 

There is separate stations to order different type of foods (al pastor station, taco station, etc). Then you eventually end up at the end to pay at the cashier. We ordered Al pastor and chicharones tacos, with mole fries. 

The food was good but since we were waiting to go through each station, by the time we paid our food was warm instead of hot. The food was delicious and the ingredients were fresh except we wished the chicharones was crispier. I'm assuming since we came in late the crispiness was gone over all.

There is seating everywhere. I'm not sure if this place has always been Taco Y Taco, but there is 2nd story seating.
