The Mr. and I have been on the hunt lately for the the best menudo and posole in Maricopa County. Both were delicious here. Portion sizes are a bit large for these, fyi. The posole had a rich chicken broth flavor, a good amount of hominy, and had a big chunk of beef spine. The menudo had a good ratio of hominy to broth and plenty of tripe. The horchata was good but had a little too much cinnamon for my liking. The service was good and the restaurant was clean. Overall, I'd come back!
