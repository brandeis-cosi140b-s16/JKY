Often go here late at night for happy hour and they have $2 and $3 tacos and cheap beer specials. The flavour is amazing! The service is fantastic! I recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious taco-- not overly authentic but still has lots of delicious Mexican flare. Relatively new-- I have a feeling they will do well!
