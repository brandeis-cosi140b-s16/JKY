I come here all the time . It's one of my favorite places. The decor is lovely and the music is always good. The food is delish but can be pricey. Happy hour is from 2-6 and I highly recommend going at that time. The nachos are amazing. The service at the bar can be hit or miss. They are always busy and they can tend to be inattentive.
