Really interesting sitting on the upper level. My wife and I were able to celebrate a birthday here and we really liked our food.

Went with some friends who are not the most adventurous and they also enjoyed their food. 

I wasn't a huge fan of the green chile pork but I did enjoy others. Fajitas were very good. The spices were just right. The salsa and chips very filling.

I love a good mariachi and we were definitely serenaded. 

Overall great atmosphere and a lot of good experiences in the past.
