My husband and I went to Viva the day after their grand opening.  The decor is very modern, clean lines, nice layout, full bar, plenty of seating in the bar area and generous porch seating that over looks the intersection of Trade & College.  Perfect for people watching.

Although the salsa is very fresh it has the consistency of apple sauce and it is very bland.  We thought we had observed some people requesting additional seasoning in theirs but we could not catch our waitress at the bar.  For some reason there was only one bar tender serving 15-20 people ordering lunch at the bar as well as preparing all the other drinks for lunch hour.

I ordered the chicken & corn enchilada.   It was delightfully different that the typical enchilada covered in cheese and red sauce.  My husband order the tacos.  He asked for one pork and one brisket.  The waitress didn't hear him so they brought out two brisket.  Upon request they promptly brought out a pork taco.  He said the pork was better than the brisket.  

Unfortunately, we felt a little put off when we got the bill and they charged us for the extra taco.  Some how we paid for their mistake?  The sides of beans & spinach were also a little bland but it is nice to have your not so typical side selections to choose from.  They guy next to us got an ear of corn.

It seems they changed the music since opening night.  It was more mellow and fit the ambiance of the restaurant.  However, since they weren't properly staffed it took a solid hour for lunch.  This is simply too long for a working lunch hour to compete with other service in the area.
