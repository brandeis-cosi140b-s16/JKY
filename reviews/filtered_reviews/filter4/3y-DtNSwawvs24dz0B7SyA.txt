I am at the Z a lot this time of year---it is the place I always take out of town guests to get a taste of southwestern food that is not the standard fare and there is a patio to enjoy the great weather. 
Absolutely the best salsa in Phoenix, bar none. Also, the best margaritas--my favorite is the house margarita made with chambord, but there is a martini styled one that is great as well.  
I have tried everything on the menu in the last several years and there is really not anything I would not suggest trying--but the crispy salmon is one of my favorites. I usually fill up on chips and salsa though and get one of their good dinner sized salads. Still miss their crispy shrimp--maybe one day they will bring it back. 
Service is almost always good and quick. 
Friday nights are fun--when I get there around 7 most of the happy hour crowd is crawling out and tables open up. I actually think the mix of tourists, left over happy hour crowd and families is a great mix. It loud, casual and laid back. Wish there were more places like it in the area.
