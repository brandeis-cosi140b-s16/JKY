Second visit was just as good as the first and reminded us about the AMAZING basement atmosphere and a local vibe. 

This visit we made reservations for a late dinner and sat upstairs. I love the bar where we sat and waited for the rest of our friends to arrive. It was a very busy place because it doubles as the front of the kitchen where you can watch all the activity first hand. Quite entertaining actually. 

The Rokerij steak was a bit pricy.... but my taste buds weren't disappointed. My wife had a shrimp and HOME MADE pasta dish that was also delicious. Gata love home made pasta!

The only bummer was my green chili mashed potato's appeared to have been made a few days earlier and not very palatable... same as the first visit. AND since this is Hatch Chili season I was hoping to get a little heat, but no joy.

Don't be scared... hit this place up and ENJOY. It's worth a visit for the atmosphere alone!
