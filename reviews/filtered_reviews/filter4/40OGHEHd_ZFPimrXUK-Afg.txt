As a fan of both cheap authentic Mexican and Enchiladas, I thought I would give this place a shot. First, it helps if you speak Spanish, because the menu is all in the native language. If not, you can figure out that pretty much everything comes with some variation of queso (cheese) and salsa/mole (sauce).

Yes, there are also traditional enchiladas and tacos and such, but I was more intrigued by the colorful new combinations.

I asked for the best of the chicken enchiladas, and they delivered. The meat was shredded well, and it meshed with the combination of salsa verda, cheese and avocado. A very green dish, and it didn't weigh me down afterward. A very nice price, too: $4.50.

The location and ambiance is nothing spectacular down on Central Ave. near the Vietnamese places, but it's a good place to try a spin on an old favorite for not that much money.
