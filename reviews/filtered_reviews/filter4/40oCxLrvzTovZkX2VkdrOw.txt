Taco Monday is the twist at this semi-new place. The place is quaint and had plenty of heaters outside for the nice patio and small wrap-a-round bar. The promotion did not really draw huge crowds, but that just meant I got to eat quicker I suppose. Most tacos are either two or three bucks and I picked a few of the Adobe chicken tacos with white meat. The menu says hot, but the attractive bartender said to expect more of a smoky flavor and she was right. The tacos had good flavor and the only heat came from the blistered jalapeno's. They included a few chips and salsa (normally $2) and some nice pickled onions to complete the inexpensive meal. A few TV sets outside and cold beers and this seems like a good addition to the Scottsdale scene - at least for tacos.
