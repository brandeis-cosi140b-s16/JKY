I may live in Brooklyn now, but despite the bajillion restaurant options in NYC I still pine for Yo Rita. I really wish I could transport this place. I miss it terribly. Amazing tacos, great veggie options too. I've never had anything here that I didn't love. I think I'm definitely asking my Pittsburgh friends to send me freeze dried Tuna tacos for Christmas. 

I only give it four stars because I haven't been there in so long that I'm not totally sure that I'm honestly recalling the food to be five star-caliber,  or if I'm just really hungry for Yo Rita's right now.
