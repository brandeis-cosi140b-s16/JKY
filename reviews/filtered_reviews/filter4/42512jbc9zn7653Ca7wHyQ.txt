This place is great. Our server Karla and her trainee were awesome. Funny, personable. Yeah it's a little loud in there and the seating is a tad crammed for 2 people but it was okay! It was busy for a Monday night which is a good sign. 

The sangria is awesome, I had the swordfish tacos with a jalepeno slaw which made my night, my boyfriend had the carne asada, which came out pretty rare when he ordered medium rare, but they fixed it no questions asked. 

Decor is fun, I lovedddd the wall art behind the hostess stand. Good looking staff, I'll be back soon!
