The service was average but the food saved this from being a three star review. We were a demanding table of 5 (MORE BEAN DIP!!!@!) but our waiter and help were able to keep up. All in all, we had about three rounds of chips and dip before our food came. It felt a little long, but it was worth the wait. Dinner arrived sizzling hot and everybody enjoyed their food. The shrimp fajitas need more shrimp and less onions taking up room on the plate (sneaky sneaky). Good salsa, great bean dip, and delicious enchilada sauce.
