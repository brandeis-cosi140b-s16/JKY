Fantastic Latino street food and REAL margaritas (none of that mix-from-a-bottle stuff)!

Among the dives of Central Avenue is Three Amigos, a fantastic blend of Mexican and Dominican food that is loaded with flavor. Real hand-made corn tortillas, flavorful meats, and slightly addictive rice await you. I've had their burrito, an open-faced knife-and-fork endeavor that uses fresh avocado in lieu of guac, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Most recent visit, though, I skipped the plates and assembled my own entree from the street food menu. Two gorditas (completely forget the Taco Bell tragedy you are thinking of - looks and tastes nothing like that) and a side of rice. My hint to you: go for sausage as your meat. Spicy without being hot and a perfect black char give it a smokey quality.

The margaritas are to die for - order one, you won't regret it. They arrive as a clear drink with a slight cloudiness and a lime wedge. Why not the customary radioactive green? These things are fresh! Silver tequila and fresh lime juice mix to create these Three Amigos signatures.

They can get crowded, however, so shoot for a non-traditional meal time to get seated faster.
