We had a pleasant experience overall. David was a wonderful doorman! What a great first impression we had when we were each greeted by name as he checked our IDs. It's silly, but a small gesture like that can really make a big difference in the atmosphere.

We didn't realize how small the place was. There is a bar room in the front and then a small back room with tables. The seating was first come, first served. I'm not sure if it's like that on the weekends or all of the time. Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait that long to get a table, although it is a bit cramped back there! We had a party of 4 and part of our table was inconveniently located just under the projector screen, so we had to do some shuffling to get quasi-comfortable. 

The service was great considering how packed the place was. We started out with a pitcher of margaritas and an order of guacamole and chips. The guac was good and a great way to start the meal. We stuck to the taco menu and everyone was very impressed with their orders. Each order comes with two small tacos, so it's a great way to sample and share! I ordered the lamb and the brisket and loved both of them! Another favorite was the slow-roast pork taco.

Good service, good food! Looks like they have some great happy hour specials, I'd love to check that out sometime!
