I have never been to El Hefe at night, only for lunch or early happy hours so my review is for the food an ambiance during the daytime. I come here often for lunch, they have great street tacos, salsas and quesadillas. The happy hour is spot on with both food and drink specials from 3-7pm. Taco Tuesdays have $2 tacos and the patio is awesome when the weather is nice. 

While I can't speak to the night time atmosphere this is a great spot to grab lunch or happy hour on Mill.
