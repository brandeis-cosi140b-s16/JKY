Went there for dinner with another couple.  Had a great time, the food is delicious and very filling. I had the Short rib burrito which was very fresh and flavorful.  Was a nice size portion with plenty of filling. I could only eat 2 thirds of it, my husband ate the rest.  I may try it as the bowl next time. The other people I was with had the Urban Tacos, again very tasty.  Their Black Beans are excellent.  The Salsas were yummy, my favourite was the Hatch.  Also the Queso dip was really good.  The chips very light fresh and tasty,  not sure why some reviews stated that the chips taste like store chips.  Definitely not the case. I do think the bottle beer a little too pricey even at happy hour prices.  The house Margaritas very good, not too sweet, and you can taste the tequila, which is a thumbs up for me and a great price at $5.  Love the d√©cor of the place, small, rustic and quaint. Great atmosphere.   This place is Gourmet Mexican food and not your typical basic Mexican restaurant.  I love that everything tastes so fresh and hand made.  The dishes are bursting with flavor and that it's a limited and simple menu and great prices.  Definitely will be going back for more.
