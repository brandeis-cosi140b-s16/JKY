Went there for brunch with my family and everyone enjoyed the place. Food was really decent, tasted fresh and authentic not like the typical Americanized Mexican food. was not impressed with the bloody Mary bar one bit, highly recommend avoiding it. The Huevos Rancheros and there chipotle salsa were great. Service was great and the place was very comfortable and pleasant.
