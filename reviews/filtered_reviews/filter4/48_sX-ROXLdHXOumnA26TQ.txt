Went here recently, wondering what had changed beside the name and the sign outside.

It turns out that the experience is quite different now, but not in altogether negative ways.

I was a little bummed to see that they had switched from that exciting picture menu to a four-pager with no photos, but oh well.  Also a bit discouraging was the fact that there were about a dozen items on the menu that were crossed off with a pen.  They should probably just print new paper inserts.

We got a horchata, and there was something wrong with it.  It was "off."  It was the kind of deal where I had to keep taking little sips to verify that something was wrong, but there definitely was.  They happily took it back and took it off the bill.

So then I was worried . . . .  Was the food going to be okay?  Would there be something off about it, too?

No need to worry, our enchiladas were really, really good.  My wife got the veggie enchiladas poblanas (with an excellent dark mole sauce), and I got the enchiladas verdes.  Both were dynamite.  Mine could have used a bit more sauce.

As it was, we pretty much cleaned our plates, which is a testament to how good the dishes were, because they're piled high with rice, refried beans, lettuce, tomato, avocado, queso fresco, sour cream, etc.

I also love it that they have my favorite hot sauce - Tapatio - at the table.

One more change from the Casas de las Enchiladas days: the woman waiting tables spoke English.  I was more than happy to practice my Spanish with the waitstaff at the old restaurant, but now I no longer have to embarrass myself, and will no longer receive a sliced avocado when I order a horchata.
