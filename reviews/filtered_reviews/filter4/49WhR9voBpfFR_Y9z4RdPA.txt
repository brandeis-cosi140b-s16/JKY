So we went for my girlfriend's birthday.  I have to say I was definitely a fan of the open layout.  The kitchen was in full view and the space was definitely utilizing the great weather of Phoenix.  Don't fret if you get a spot outside as there are numerous misters ready to cool you down.  If you do sit by the misters, expect a cool, almost tropical breeze during your meal.  Honestly, the food was pretty good.  We had the chicken tacos which were small but tasty, had the suzuki roll which was the star of the dinner, and a spicy yellow tail roll that was eehhh ok.  The fish isn't amazing but the creative rolls and the atmosphere was fantastic.  Our service was spotty.  They made efforts but they were clearly too busy.  Likely, this issue will clear up as they outgrow their growing pains.  For dessert, we had the chocolate lava cake which was yummy.  The horchata ice cream was a bit icy for our taste but was made up by the juicy cake.  Would try again as the menu was so expansive we couldn't try everything we wanted.  Good business strategy, offering numerous amounts of dishes that you have to try :)
