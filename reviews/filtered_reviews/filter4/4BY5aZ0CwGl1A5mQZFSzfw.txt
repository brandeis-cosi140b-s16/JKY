Tried this place after many recomendations. Not too bad. Had the carne Asda tacos. Tacos were good, loaded grilled beef on corn tortillas with a little onion and gaucamole. Wanted a side of chips and gaucamole, however be warned they only have one option available that is an 8oz serving with chips for about $6. A little pricey, but tasty.
Store was busy, however server was extremely friendly and explained the menu as it was my first time.
