I have never had a negative experience here really. I have sent back one plate I think since coming here. I come to Joyride at least once a week and always get the 3 tacos with a free side and always have some nachos. Having some churro's with a dark chocolate dipping sauce is also delicious at the end of the meal. 
It's a very chill, relaxed place to hangout and have lunch or dinner. Every so often I will go in by myself and sit at the bar, have some tacos and just enjoy watching some TV. The staff is always super friendly and the food is extremely consistent.
