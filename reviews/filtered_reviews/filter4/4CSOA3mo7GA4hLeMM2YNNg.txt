Lets just say when your hungry after clubbing all night long and all you want is food close by that's open late and serve big portions to soak up all the alcohol that you have consumed by the bar this is the place to be.
The price is decent, the food is good, and  the service is friendly. Thats what had us coming back 3 nights in a row after the clubs, and the fact that we stayed  at Bally's.
At some point during the second night I went here It felt like there was only one guy working. My friends and I could swear he was the one sitting people, taking orders, making the food and bringing out the food. We saw NO OTHER PERSON working in the place that night(or morning you could call it at 4am)....

Overall a great place to dine at! =]
