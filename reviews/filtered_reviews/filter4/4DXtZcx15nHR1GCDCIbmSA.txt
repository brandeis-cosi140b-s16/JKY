Jay Z and Beyonc√©, milk and cookies, Chino Bandido, Nutella and virtually anything.... What do all these have in common? Two worlds coming together to create a dynamic duo! Chinese food meets Mexican food! The greatest love story that has never been told! We enjoyed everything we ate, Jerk chicken, red jade chicken, jerk rice, black beans, pork and jerk chicken quesadilla! Don't let the jerk word fool you it has great robust flavor with even better price! I recommend this place on your next outing fo sho.
