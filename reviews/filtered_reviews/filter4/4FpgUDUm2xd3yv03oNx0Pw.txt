I love this place. It is our consistent meat the Caris' joint at least one night a week. Chicken Quesadilla for the kids, burritos, enchiladas and baskets of mini tacos for the big kids. Plus a $3 margarita or three... the first time we went for a business meeting our server was about 150 years old, but bless her sassy heart she was fun and had no patience for us until we sassed her right back, then she was great. Since then, the younger staff has been great, even when we wipe them out of chips!
