I don't know why there are so many bad reviews! I love Macayos. The food is great, and the service is great. Yes, the drinks are a bit pricey - one margarita being upwards $8-11 but happy hour is great and if you ask they sometimes have drink specials like 2 for $14 margaritas. 

If I had to recommend a meal I would recommend the chimicanga con queso - yum yum yum. 

Get a beer or a margarita and just sit back enjoy the awesome atmosphere and great food.
