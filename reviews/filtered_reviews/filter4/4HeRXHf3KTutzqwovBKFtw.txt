I'm rounding up a bit and giving 4 stars.  So torn between 3 and 4, but I will go with 4 because the service was great!

First impression:  love the booths!  Super comfy.  They have a private dining room that looks like it can seat up to 12...oh my that room looks fancy!   Romantic mood overall.  Good for date night.

Being from San Diego, I have eaten a ton of Mexican food in my life.  Granted, I KNOW I'm on the strip.  I know that for sure.  I hate even mentioning price in reviews (unless it's in a good way) because it's on the strip, so I should know what I'm getting into.  I just think some of the menu was a lot higher than it could have been.  I reiterate, I knew this going into a strip restaurant, so I can't be that booty hurt about it.

The appetizer was just, meh.  We got the sampler plate.  The best part was the shrimp quesadilla.  The empanada was no bueno.  Maybe I'm used to the little old lady in San Diego who makes them in her house and fries them fresh right before we pick up, so honestly it's not even a fair comparison.  

I got a shrimp salad that was very fresh and tasty.  My husband got a $52 carne asada plate.  He LOVED the black beans and roasted pepper.  The chips and salsa were decent.

Margaritas were yummy, but honestly, I don't think I've met a margarita I DIDN'T like (premixed Jose Cuervo included, hahaha).

All in all, great atmosphere and a good choice if you're going to see a show in Aria and want to stay in the same vicinity.  Great for date night.  Would I go out of my way to go here again?  Not sure, maybe just for margaritas and snacks.  But great if you're staying at Aria and don't want to leave property.
