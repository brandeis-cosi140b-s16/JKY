Their Carnitas is the best I've ever had!!! And the outside patio seating is killer on a gorgeous Vegas day. But definitely big enough to share! We started with the Peruvian ceviche and it was delicious.  Our waitress was busy talking about her kids to another table so we got to wait for her for like 5 mins to finish up her conversation prior to taking our order. She also never stopped by to check on how everything was. She dropped the check off to our table without saying a word to us. It was very odd to say the least.  They also charge $.50 for water per person, I'm not really sure why, and it seems like such a  nominal fee that it doesn't make sense to even do it. I have never seen a place charge for water before.
