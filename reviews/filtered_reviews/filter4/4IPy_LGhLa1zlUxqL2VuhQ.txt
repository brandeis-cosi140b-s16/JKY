When I first arrived in Charlotte the first order of business was where do I need to eat before going home and this was top on the list ( grilled cheese food truck is #2). We drive up to this hole in the wall style place with a wing of outdoor seating that was packed with people. We go inside and are met by our server who was very friendly. We ordered our queso appetizer as I begin to scour the menu for goodies. Settling on the enchiladas was an excellent choice! Overall lovely experience for a quick and reasonably priced meal. If ever in the area craving authentic style Mexican foods stop in and carb up!!
