This place trying hard to get on board the gourmet taco restaurant trend. Located in an old strip mall, they've done an entire renovation to the interior of their space to create the urban-industrial atmosphere they are shooting for. Music from the stereo behind the bar fills the restaurant almost as if there was a DJ in the building. For food, they've got two things going for them: excellent salsas and well prepared meats for their taco creations. With a group of whatever number, they want to start you off with an appetizer of chips and your choice of their homemade salsas. Then you each order your choice from a good variety of tacos. I'm giving them four stars because the salsas were so good and the meat was tasty, but I almost gave them three stars because Lunch for one was $17 (two taco plate and an iced tea).
