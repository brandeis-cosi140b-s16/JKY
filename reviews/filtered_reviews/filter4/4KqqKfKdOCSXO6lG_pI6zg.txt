I love this place. They're constantly having deals, my go to is from 2-4 students (with IDs) get most of their menu half off, really cannot get any better than that. 

The food is amazing. I always get the mad Mex burrito and no matter how hungry I am I can never finish it, good news though..it seriously tastes just as good the next day. Their jersey chips are out of this world..(get them with the ranch and wing sauce and thank me later!) not a big fan of their guac, there isn't enough flavor in it for me but forfeiting guac is a small price to pay for eating the rest of their food. 

The service is kind of subpar all around. The servers are ALWAYS nice and friendly and fun but just seem to come to the table few times even when they're not that busy. My most recent server (Charla??) was great though, the best service I've had yet! 

The atmosphere is not for everyone. The tables are pretty small and very close together, like you're dining with people you don't know. And the music is LOUD, when its a full restaurant it's to the point that I honestly just sit and eat because it's pretty impossible to have a conversation. Other than the noise level and the seating, it's a pretty awesome place, their style is not boring at all. 

Bottom line: you need to eat here. The portions are huge, the foods great, and you'll leave with a full happy belly.
