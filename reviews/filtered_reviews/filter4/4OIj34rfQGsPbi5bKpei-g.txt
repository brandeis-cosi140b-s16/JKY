It's a tiny little place with no air conditioner, but really tasty and cheap tacos.  I had the bbq tacos, carne asada, al pastor and tripe.  I didn't care much for the tripe tacos, but I think it's an acquired taste.  My husband had a beer for $2.50.  In addition to cheap tacos, they had a little salsa bar.  Some how, even though the food was cheap, we still managed to spend like $40.  The tacos are under $3 for the most part.  I think my husband ordered a burrito to take home which was $4.  I guess the cheaper the food, the more compelled you are to buy! :-)
