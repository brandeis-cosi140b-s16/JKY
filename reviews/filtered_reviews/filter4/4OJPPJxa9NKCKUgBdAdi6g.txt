Yes, it's Tex-Mex. No it won't be better than that time you had tacos made by your grandmother who only spoke Spanish on the side of the road in Guadalajara with fish she just grabbed out of the ocean. 

What it will be is a totally above average casino meal with reasonable (for the Strip) prices, free chips/salsa and great service. I sat at the bar and the bartenders were the nicest guys in the world...not too chatty, not too formal, just straight up friendly. The salsa is nicely spicy, the food portions are big and it all comes out as described. I'm sure if I paid twice as much I could have a better meal elsewhere, but that's hardly Gonzalez/Gonzalez's problem, right?

Note: This is around the corner from the casino floor, so if you're like me and don't like to see slot machines as you eat, this is one of your only options in NYNY.
