Ah, Dos.

The old standby. For the last 9 years, it has always been our backup plan when we wanted to escape the newest pretentious old town Scottsdale club. 

"I'm bored. And my drink was $10." 
"What do you want to do?"
"I dunno. What do you want to do?"
"Let's go to Dos."
"Okay!"

Instantly a mood changer. Cheap drinks, rowdy people, good mix of music. Service is inconsistent. One night it can be great, the next night you can have a total a-hole bartender. Some of my guy friends have had issues with the bouncers. 

Food isn't the greatest but it tastes pretty good when it is 1:30 am and you know your only other choice is a long line at a fast food place. Gringo rolls are my favorite. 

Great place for the young and the single. My girlfriends and I would have quite the time here before we all became married old ladies.
