[Location is 1204 S. Main].  I really enjoyed the management and staff here. All were friendly and bilingual. More than willing to allow me to practice my Spanish.  The food was serve quick, and hot.  The (pineapple fruit) drink I had accompanied my Veggie tacos and guacamole tip nicely.  Only down side to this place was the chips.  I love good tortilla chips and Don Juan's didn't get me hot or bothered.  Still for the price, this place was a great value.
