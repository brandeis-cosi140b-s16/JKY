Service is relaxed and reasonable for the atmosphere.  I came in for lunch with a co-worker.  Our waiter was attentive and we were ready to order so we made his job easy.  Chips and Salsa is awesome!  Best chips and salsa I've ever had haha which says a lot in old town!  Mini Taco's as an appetizer wasn't that great of a choice. That was their only flaw.
