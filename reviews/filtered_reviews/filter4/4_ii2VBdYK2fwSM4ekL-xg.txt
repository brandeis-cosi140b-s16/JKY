This restaurant was a great surprise to me. I was attracted by the menu posted outside for the Mexican ingredients in the dishes that are less common in the US. The dish I ordered (lobster tamales, ceviche, huitlacoche) was artfully presented and well-balanced, without being pretentious. A nice combo of savory, acid, sweet and spice. 

Not only that, but I sat on the patio, along the canal, listening the gondola drivers with beautiful voices, enjoying an adult beverage. It encompassed all the culinary pleasures I was hoping for, as well as the Vegas kitsch that I expected.
