We get take out from here a couple times a month. Usually get the salads, with chicken. Always comes out good, little variation. 2 dressings to choose from and different proteins. Plenty of food, good portions in a homemade tortilla underneath which is so good. They also have different specials for the day of the week. Tuesday is my fav with the coconut shrimp tacos, yum. 

Staff was friendly and accomodating for each individuals preferences for toppings. Usually order online first and pick up to make it quicker, however this time I went to order online at about 8:45 and it said pick up time was 9:45. Didn't feel like waiting that long so we just went over there and there was no line, so it didn't really matter, just curious why the online time was approx 1 hour later (usually seems about 1/2 hour) maybe the time of day?

Never had any issues, and I love their salads and will continue to go back for them, and those daily specials.
