My friend suggested we go to Cafe Rio instead of the sushi joint we had planned for late lunch/early dinner.   I'm so glad we went here instead because  I would never have discovered this place that offers some seriously BOMB (as in good!) mexican food. 

 Their portions are humongous so my friend and I decided to split our orders.  He got the Pork Barbacoa Burrito and I got the Grilled Fire Steak Salad.  The Pork Barbacoa is heaven!  Wow!  Sooo freakin good! So good, I almost wished I got that instead of the salad but I digress.  The salad was delicious as well but next time I'll stick to the Pork Barbacoa.
