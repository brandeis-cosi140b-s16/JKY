I have been here multiple times for breakfast and dinner and have really enjoyed it. The menu and decor has changed but I actually really liked it the way it was before AND the way it is now, which I feel like is a hard thing to do. For breakfast we've had their Benedict and the Huevos Rancheros and both were good. The Benedict isn't a traditional one but it is still good. For dinner, the guac is great and comes in really cool bowls..and there is usually a check in offer for it. The Naranja Roja margarita is sooo good it's spicy with habenero in it. I think the Carnitas Tacos are the best thing on the menu and I was very disappointed when I strayed away from them and decided to try the duck. It was like 4 pieces and they were just way too fatty and rubbery and so overpriced. Our friend got the lamb though and was raving about it, so maybe I'll have to try that sometime. One complaint I do have is that you can't mix and match the three tacos, you have to get three of the same which is annoying.
