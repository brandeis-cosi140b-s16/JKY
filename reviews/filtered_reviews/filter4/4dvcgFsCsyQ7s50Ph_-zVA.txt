The first time you eat at Carlsbad Tavern you will notice the newspaper menu titled Carlsbad Daily Guano. At lunch time I will normally eat the Crab Stuffed Poblanos which is two poblano chilies stuffed with crab meat, peppers, onions and cilantro covered in a smoked cascabell & yellow bell cream sauce.

After 4:00 PM you can order dinner entrées I recommend the Osso Bucco which is pork shank slow roasted with serranos, garlic, onion and leeks with an apple chipotle glaze. Or the Red Chile-encrusted Halibut which is baked and encrusted with red chile spices and chipotle lime beurre blanc. If you look to the top right of each entrée selection you will notice the wine pairing that is recommended for each dish.

If you like New Mexico styled food with green chiles you will love Carlsbad Tavern I think the food has the correct amount of heat and is not to spicy except for one item the Habanero Cheeseburger which comes with freshly ground habanero chilies mixed into the ground beef don't say I didn't warn you but umm good. A Habanero pepper is freaking ridiculously hot checking in at 100,00 to 300,000 Scoville units of ass kicking heat come on ice cream.

Warning this burger may cause temporary blindness or loss of hearing.
