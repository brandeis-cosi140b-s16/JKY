This place was pretty good for Mexican, and I'll definitely be back.  My favorite was the Vampiro, which had guacamole and yummy grilled onions.  The bean and cheese burrito was huge and pretty good.  They also seem to have a pretty good happy hour menu which I'll be inclined to take advantage of.  The service was pretty good and the workers friendly, overall I have no complaints.  Although if a bottle of Coke is really $3, I would certainly stick with water.
