The first time i came here, everything was on point!! I got their delicious chips and salsa along with 2 shrimp tacos, 2 fish tacos, and 2 carve Asada tacos. All sooo good. My boyfriend thought the carne Asada tacos tasted like cat food, but I liked them! I also got their Bloody Mary and its one of the best I've had! 

I went back here last night for their awesome all day Tuesday happy hour with my BFF and we got the corn on the cob thing with paprika which was recommended to us by our super awesome waitress and I got 2 fish tacos and a carne Asada taco. My friend got 2 carne Asada tacos and a shrimp taco. We also got their guacamole which was delicious! and we can't forget about those Bloody Mary's! I thought the carne Asada tacos tasted better this time around while she thought the meat was over cooked and preferred her first time there better. 

The reason they lost a star from me is because if their inconsistency of their food. I guess I always go back to a place thinking what I get this time will taste exactly like last time. And also their drinks aren't strong at all. My friend and I are both light weights and we didn't feel a think after 2 bloody Mary's. usually after 2 drinks, were flying! 

Overall, I do love this place!
