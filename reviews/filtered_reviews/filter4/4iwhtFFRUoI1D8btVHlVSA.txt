Are you in Pittsburgh? Do have a craving for chips and salsa but are unable to satisfy it because you're Pittsburgh? Just go to Mad Mex. It's my absolutely favorite uber-americanized-californized-tex-mex-bar-restaurant-voodoo-lounge in the whole world! 

They're unabashedly american-tex-mex here, but they also respect their Pittsburgh roots. You can get a buffalo chicken burrito here. Try finding THAT in San Francisco! You can even get your burrito with cross-cut fries. oh Pittsburgh - i miss you - sometimes. 

That said, they actually do have awesome, humungous, fork-and knife burritos such as Super Mad Mex with Steak. So good. When they say spicy, they mean spicy. The restaurant has the coolest logo ever (I bought 2 pint glasses to take home with me). The service is great, if not eccentric. 

They have half-off food after 11pm, in the Oakland tradition. However, its typically way too crowded at that time to eat successfully. The lesser-known secret is they do half-off lunch from 2-4pm Mon-Thursday. This is a much better way to go. 

FYI: The chips/salsa are free at the bar but not at the table. Also, they will try to sell you guacamole and sour cream with every dish - but it's not free!

Mad Mex also has a decent selection of beer on tap, including, at various times, Rogue Dead Guy, Delirium Tremens, et al. And of course, they have IC Lite and Yeungling for the pittsburgher in you.

So go, get a huge-azz margarita, some beer, some great food, and stumble down atwood street drunk with the rest of the crowd.
