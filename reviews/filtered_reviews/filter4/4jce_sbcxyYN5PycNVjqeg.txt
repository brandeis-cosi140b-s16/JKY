Had Carolina's for lunch yesterday.  Just happened to be downtown with some clients I am consulting for.  Got the beef enchilada combo.  The food was great as always.  I usually go for the burros, although I rarely get through a foot long (who could?).

My colleagues got cheese enchiladas and chicken tacos.  Everyone was very happy with the food, and we all left stuffed.  They even paid!  The only thing better then lunch at Carolina's is a free lunch at Carolina's.
