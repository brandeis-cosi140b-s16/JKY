41/2.  Love this place.  As a rule, if you go to places that get 4 or more on Yelp then you're typically safe and very good.  This is no exception.  The pork for two is so good.  The black and white bean sides are delicious.  Next time I have to get the guacamole made fresh, people around us had it and loved it.  The various bartenders I've met here are all very good and honest about the wine list.  The best red I believe is the first one of the red portion of the list.  Forgot what it was but very good.  I almost ordered something else, they gave me a taste and it wasn't my style, offered this other wine.  Fabulous stuff.  The restaurant is packed on weekends and the atmosphere is fun.  Going back for a business lunch tomorrow, can't wait.
