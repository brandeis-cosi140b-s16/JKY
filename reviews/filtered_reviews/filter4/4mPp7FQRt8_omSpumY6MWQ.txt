This review will seem a bit mixed, but bare with me. My husband and I have been going here for almost two years and I always get the same thing - a chicken burro (read: burrito) enchilada style, in particular "Christmas Style" which is half red chili and half green chili sauce - my favorite when I lived in New Mexico. I've tried other dishes that friends have ordered and they're good, but this one item is amazing and enough to keep me coming back regularly. 

Now to the other side, the experience. I've read other reviews and unfortunately had some of the same issues with the discomfort of padded benches, the lack of staff,  and decor. I waited to write this review until I'd been back a few times to confirm, but, yeah, I think they read the same reviews and made some changes. The benches are gone, the decor and general upkeep has improved (though still a little quirky, which is fine by me) and the service has been drastically improved. I'm happy to continue my foodie relationship with this authentic and spicy restaurant!
