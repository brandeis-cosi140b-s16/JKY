They have dollar taco nights on Tuesdays and we love it!!! You can't beat $1 tacos!
I usually order 4-5 tacos for myself and husband usually gets 8-9 for himself. Yes we are fatties =) 

The tacos are pretty good and the margaritas are pretty good too ( although they are not really strong) 

The servers are friendly and nice and the place is pretty clean!
