Went to Casa Don Juan last night with my family and absolutely loved it! Ricardo our server was very personable and funny. He made sure he was on top of everything and that we enjoyed our meal. The food was the most authentic I've had in Vegas thus far. My enchiladas dish was great and the recommendation of the Verde sauce was on point. The fireball ochata was a first for all of us and now a favorite. Definitely going back! A Little pricey but worth it!
