Went on a Sunday. Awesome patio. Very cheap Corona. Live original music. Service was very good, chips and salsa very good. Their queso dip is loaded and delicious. Only thing that was disappointing was their mahi and shrimp tacos. 

Would definitely get drunk on the patio again but next time I will only eat chips, salsa, and queso.
