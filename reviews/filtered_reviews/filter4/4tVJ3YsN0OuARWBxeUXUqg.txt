Good and trendy modern Mexican food. We had the guacamole (good),  Flatbread (good mushrooms), enchilada s and reposada tequila flight. The best dish overall was the chicken tacos!! Wow....great dinner but small plates so come to taste all the different flavors but expect to not be stuffed. Perfect portions!
