DON'T LET THE SHADY PINK BUILDING FOOL YOU! YELP helped me discover this hidden gem. The food was super good and super authentic. I found my inner fatman while I was here and sampled two tacos, a gordita, and sope. The TACOS were to die for. By far MY FAVORITE. I had one steak and one pork. DELICIOUS! The SOPE and GORDITA were just more of the same goodness in a fried tortilla. Super Good, and Super Cheap. Check it out!
