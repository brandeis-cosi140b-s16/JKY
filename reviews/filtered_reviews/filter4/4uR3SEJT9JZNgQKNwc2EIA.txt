Have been here twice - only had tacos (figured they had to be good, hence their name) I've tried the beer battered white fish & the BBQ Mahi Mahi tacos - both were very good. (although the rice and beans are pretty dry, nothing to rave about) I love the homemade tortillas. Also - you can't go wrong with chips & queso (their salsa w/ corn in it is pretty tasty as well) Both times I came here on a Saturday for lunch & ended up sitting at the bar because the place was packed. The atmosphere is very hipster but nice, with very cool paintings adorning the walls. (LOVE the huge Samurai painting) If I want a good fish taco I'll come here. Not sure if I want / need to try anything else here, I'll stick to tacos.
