I have to admit I was not as impressed as I expected to be, but I was not let down either. I liked everything we ordered, which was the fusion chicken fried rice, fusion tacos (chicken and pork) and a fusion beef burrito. The tacos were my fav, the pork especially. The tea was perfect, hot jasmine tea, yum.  Our waitress was very nice, the wait wasn't too bad (felt worse cuz we were starving).  I wouldn't get fried rice again, maybe not the burrito, but tacos yes.
