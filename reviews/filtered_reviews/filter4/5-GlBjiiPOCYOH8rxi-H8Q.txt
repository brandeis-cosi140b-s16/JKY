Went to Javier's on a whim after a long gamble at the Aria to grab some eats. Being from Texas and used to Tex-Mex I was excited to see what they had to offer. Note: I was told they have no relation to the Javier's in Dallas.

The ambiance is an old world Mexican cantina. White plaster walls and iron adorn the restaurant, while a round wooden bar sits well positioned at the entrance. The bathrooms are quite nice and have a rather chatty attendant... who isn't too intrusive but makes his presence known.

Obviously I had to try their margarita, which was great... not the best... but very good, nonetheless. The guacamole was small and perfect for two people to share. It lacked cilantro, which is a must in any guacamole I prepare myself. Good not great.

The chips and salsa were really the highlight. Very reminiscent of my childhood eating in Tex-Mex cantinas with my parents and welcome callback from my past. It's a little sweeter than most salsas, but it tasted quite fresh, I enjoyed it considerably. As I did the chips. They tasted fresh.

I had a taco enchilada platter that was very good. Everything tasted very Tex-Mex. Perfect seasoning, perfect heat, and the taste was very good. 

I had seen reviews before I went that the service was very lacking. The restaurant was probably about a third full (it was early in the evening) and I was quite aware that our service may not be very good. But, I'm quite happy to report that the service was good to great.

I wish I could give it 5 stars... but it's more like a 4.5 star restaurant for me. The ambiance was a little too dark and the walls felt a little too cold and a little too bare for me. Overall, I really enjoyed the experience and the food and drink are very good quality Tex-Mex. Especially in Las Vegas. I will absolutely be returning and hope to make this a go-to spot in future Las Vegas visits.
