This place is special!  

Okay, you have to know the password to get in.  The guy at the door doesn't remember what it is, but if you promise not to rat him out and talk about your interest in herbal medicine or massage therapy, you're probably good.  They're going to ask you if you're a cop, just keep saying no.  Six or seven times seems to do the trick.

The fish tacos are outstanding and, appropriately enough, baked (not fried).  Carne asada is very tasty.  Generous portions, cheap eats, humble digs, super-friendly proprietor, improbable number of teen employees behind the counter.  Non-wimpy salsa.  BYOB if you want to eat on the patio.  Funky little shack, man.
