If you're looking for a great patio, some baller nachos or just an exotic cut of meat, the Blind Pig is the way to go!! I've been here several times, twice to eat and probably 6-8 times to get fresh cuts of meat for home preparation. The guys (and girls!) behind the counter are incredibly helpful, and will go beyond just helping you pick great meats. Last time I picked up some awesome scallops, the gentleman that helped me also suggested some preparations and the correct amount of time required to cook them. (I'm an admitted novice...) They also do some great specials and have a loyalty program, if you check the business cards on the counter. (Bonus: Use the belly app to accrue even more rewards!)

As for dining in, I suggest sitting on the patio. During our last visit, the waitress was very attentive, and the ambiance was casual and fun. We split some fantastic nachos (seriously, my favorite in Scottsdale) and I had a great salad to help assuage my cheese-y guilt! The food was great, as always, and the only complaint we had was that we never saw the oysters we ordered. We were full enough from the nachos, and since we weren't charged for them, we let it go... but we were looking forward to giving them a shot!

All in all, it's a great place. Perfect for a casual dinner, catching up with friends! (Pick up some great meats to take home while you're there!)
