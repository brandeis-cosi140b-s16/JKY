Great new find for us, we stumbled across it on a Sunday and were trying to find a place and not many were open in the area.  We saw it and all the cars 1130am Sunday and thought, why not?   Glad we did, very tasty food, good portions and really good flavor.  Some certainly authenic dishes along with the normal dishes as well!  The Mole was Que Bueno!

The "right crowd" was in the restaurant and knew the food had to be good and we weren't wrong.  Sure it's not in the best part of town, but don't let that scare you off of a great place!
