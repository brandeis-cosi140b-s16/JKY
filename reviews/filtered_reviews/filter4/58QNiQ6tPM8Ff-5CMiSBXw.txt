Wow - for a relatively inauthentic-looking Mexican place inside NY NY I was pretty impressed with Gonzalez Y Gonzalez. 

We sat at the bar and I ordered a very berry margarita and it was KILLER. I couldn't finish it all and the bartender gladly gave me a to-go cup. Started with some chips and salsa - the chips weren't hot but the salsa was perfect - just the right amount of spice. My cousin got the chicken nachos - meh - they were all right, but what really impressed me was the drunken chicken. It was a dinner special that day and it consisted of grilled chicken chunks, grilled veggies and a side of cornbread chorizo stuffing. My mouth was uber-happy (and as many of you may know, Mexican isn't even in my top 5 favorites.)

For Vegas it was pretty reasonable too - huge marg, couple beers, two entrees and it was around $40. Better-than-decent service and food - I'd definitely recommend.
