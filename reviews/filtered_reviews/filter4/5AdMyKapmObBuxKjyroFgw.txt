It's always a good sign when walking into a Mexican restaurant when there is a wait (even at 11:35) and when the majority of customers waiting are Mexican. As a solo eater, I was seated within 15min. Unfortunately, I was seated at a table for four people. I apologized to my server, but he smiled and said it was ok.  He remainder attentive throughout and provided excellent service. I tipped well beyond the norm. The interior is a cross between a mid to low priced restaurant with its booths and a high school cafeteria with its plain tables and chairs in the center of the restaurant. The food was good, but not great.  I had Pollo en Mole (Chicken Mole), and was actually disappointed in the mild flavor. It was missing the richness that I usually enjoy in this meal. The beans and rice were normal for any Mexican restaurant. It was a nice touch to get a bowl of soup with my chips. I also enjoyed a large draft Negra Modelo. At $3 is was a steal. I visited one other time and had a breakfast burrito.  It was certainly more flavorful than the mole, but still it did not meet my expectations.

If I could give a half star, I would have given 3.5, instead of 4. However, the friendly wait staff and quick/inexpensive bar service give it the extra half. I will return, but I will try to skip the lunch rush.
