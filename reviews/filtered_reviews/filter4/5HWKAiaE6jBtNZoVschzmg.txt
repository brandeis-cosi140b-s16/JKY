This place is usually infested with high schoolers and that makes me stressed.  Have I become a bitter old lady?  Bah hambug!

Anyways, I've been coming here for years.  I was introduced to this place some time during my ASU days by some guys I use to hang with.  While their food might not be traditional, I always enjoy my meal.  The place is decorated sparingly and the tables aren't the cleanliest [high school hangout, remember?], the portions are great for the price you pay.  I usually get the carne asada burrito combo,the California burrito combo, or the shrimp burrito.  You get moist fluffy rice, decent refried beans, and a giant [not Chipotle giant or anything but a good size] burrito for the combo.  I love how they don't pack their burritos with cheap "filler" ingredients.  They seriously stuff your burrito with a ton of flavorful meat!

I'll probably keep coming back for many years to come when I need me some Americanized-Mexican eats although I rather take my food to-go because high schoolers are the bane of my existence.  Wee!  If only their red sauce was spicier...
