As a concept, China Poblano is classic Jose Andres. The tapas-style menu is perfect for groups and a good selection of Mexican street food and Cantonese dim sum staples will offer something for everyone. However once price comes into the equation, things get a little worrying.

China Poblano does a few things very well. It's hip, casual atmosphere is right at home at the Cosmopolitan and the quick service and sharing nature of the food make it a good lunch spot. 

The Good: China Poblano's tacos are easily the highlight of the menu. The braised beef barbacoa and chicken with chorizo are delicious options, but keep in mind they are quite small. The chilaquiles are another highlight with a bright tomatillo salsa and lots of melted cheese. The service was fast and friendly and the waitstaff were good about explaining each dish.

The Bad: For as good as their Mexican options are, China Poblano struggles more with the Chinese side of the menu. The Mongolian beef salad was described as lettuce wraps on the menu, only when it arrived we discovered that wasn't the case. The beef came laden with a corn syrup sheen found only at the very best bad Chinese spots and it was very tough to chew. The restaurant's prices are high, too high for what you're getting. China Poblano is clearly catered towards to street food crowd and over $6 for a taco (2-3 bites) is too much.

Andres is doing great things for gastronomy throughout the world and while the Mexican food at China Poblano is excellent, you pay a bit too much for the Andres stamp of approval.
