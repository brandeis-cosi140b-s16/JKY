Sometimes you buy a groupon and then you accidentally don't use it your first try.  So you come back.  That happens.  It happened.

With my two visits to La Santisima, I'd say they know what they're doing.  The offer some dishes that were new to me.  Lonches, for one.  I know what lonche is in Spanglish practice, but what_a_ lonche is, was news to me.  And it was good news.  All around, the food was good.  Salsas are even better.

I did order horchata my first time...but I've totally forgotten what that was like.  That seems to have happened to much of what happened during my first year on the job.  This isn't the only thing I've forgotten.  I've blocked out a lot, apparently.

The service was fine.  I've never seen the place hoping, but maybe the weekend dinner crowd is bashful or something.  Our water cups stayed pretty full and our server was otherwise attentive.  The wait for food was never long.

Cost was fine. It is a gourmet taco shop, after all, so you get what you pay for.  Portions are not huge and style comes with a cost.  The decor is lovely.  I could steal some of their paintings for home, I like them so much.  That is, if they weren't so darn big.

I'd likely give it another visit, that is if we're in Glendale downtown, just walking around, or something.  It seems to be one of the best options.
