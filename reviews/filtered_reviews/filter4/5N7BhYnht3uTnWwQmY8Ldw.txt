Pretty nice food. Very attentive and nice waiters and waitresses and greeters at the door. But I've been to a good amount of Mexican restaurant, yet I felt like some of the food wasn't authentic enough. I feel like it needs some more sauce on the food that I ordered which is called arroz con pollo. But for that night tonight still the best  mexican restaurant I have went to in Las Vegas at least for now
