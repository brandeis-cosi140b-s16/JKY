I recently visited Las Vegas for a couple weeks and had cafe rios for the first time. I'm not a big fan of chipotle. I usually prefer Moes but cafe rios was a lot better. More flavor and better options. I ate here twice during my stay. Both times I got their huge salads. Once with grilled chicken, the other time with grilled steak. Both were flavor full and juicy. The creamy house dressing was one of the best dressings ive ever had. Everything is made right in front of you even the tortillas. The flour tortilla was freshly made and soft, a little too thick. My salad included all basic toppings including a small scoop of guac. For around 9-10$ I got a huge salad. At this price point, I feel the quality and quantity was spot on. Great spot to grab a quick lunch. I will be coming back on my next trip out west.
