Listen - this joint is exactly what you have come to expect.  The service is reliable, the beers are always cold and it's the only place other than Mexico that I consistently enjoy Corona.  

Their food is good, especially their mini chimis and quest dip - and the ambiance never disappoints.  Dining / drinking outdoors is one of my favorite things about Arizona - and for like 8 months out of the year, this is one of my favorite places to go to happy hour.

Can't go wrong - you'll never be blown away by anything, but it is always consistently better than average!
