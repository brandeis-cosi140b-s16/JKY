Ok...expected the gringo resort treatment and came away impressed by the nacho's and poblano chiles: authentic yet very well presented.  Nice atmosphere too. A tad pricy, but well worth it for the unique treatment of  Mexican standards. Highly recommend it.  Oh and the 'short' plate of nacho's is PLENTY!
