Hands down best breakfast burritos around! The service is pretty quick and they have a nice salsa bar inside for you to fill your own containers. The weekends get a little busy with the National Guard base soldiers out to eat, but it's worth the wait! I wouldn't recommend a plain bean and cheese burrito as it's very flavorless. Parking is ample with Pepsi products on the fountain!
