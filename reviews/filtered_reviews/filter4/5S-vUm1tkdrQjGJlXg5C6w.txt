YUM!  

I didn't even know this place existed until I saw the Groupon for it (yeah, I'm that person who subscribes to Groupons from other cities in preparation for my vacation).  Knowing how Vegas tends to be on the more spendy side (as opposed to Lincoln, NE), we were fully prepared to pay over and above the Groupon value.  But first look at the menu, I realized that they were actually really reasonably priced!  Just a few dollars more than what I'd spend at a nice Mexican restaurant here in Lincoln.

We didn't have a reservation, but we didn't have to wait at all - they seated us immediately.  Another thing we weren't expecting!  But as I've said in other review, Vegas seemed to be a bit slow the week we were there.

I got my margarita (seriously delicious!  And strong!  And delicious!  Oh, I already said that) and they brought out our chips and salsa.  Very good - I preferred the green salsa but they all were good.  And I don't know what it is about Mexican restaurants, but entrees always come out super fast!  

Normally, I take a bite or two of the rice and beans and that's it because they never really wow me and I'd rather save room for the entree but these were awesome and I ate pretty much all of it!  I could definitely tell they were fresh and weren't sitting around all day.  

I ordered the chicken tacos and I loved them.  I really wish I would have asked for them on flour tortillas, though - I'm not a big corn tortilla fan.  But it was still good.  

Overall, I was pretty pleased!
