Update: 
Although only three checkins, I've been to dinner here at least 15 times. Service is alway mediocre and the food always amazing. Be sure to try the sangria. 

As a local, in search for a great Mexican restaurant, I may have found it. 
Amazing food full of flavor. Beautiful interior and good service. I found this restaurant on Wednesday and came back Saturday. On my first trip I had the lunch special of grilled Mahi tacos with mango salsa and today was my favorite dish from any restaurant this year...short rib enchiladas. OMG soooo good, I'm thinking of making the 15 mile drive again tomorrow.
