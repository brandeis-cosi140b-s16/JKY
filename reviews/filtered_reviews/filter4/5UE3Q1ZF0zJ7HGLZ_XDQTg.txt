I was looking forward to try Habanero's and wasn't too sure what to expect. A dive or what? As we walked into the doors the dining area was huge. Very nicely decorated. Little confused cause the dining area was so nice it almost felt like a sit down place but dumb me they have ordering counter. 

Me and my daughter ordered the same thing. Carne asada burrito and a side of chips. The side of chips comes with two salsa. A red and green salsa. Really like the red but the green seemed a little sour to me. Just to clarify I liked both. The carne asada burrito was really good. Nice moist and juicy meat with guacamole, Pico de gallo, and Jalapenos. So it had a nice little kick to it. Not too hot but just right. 

I was very surprised by the service. They bring your food to your table and I even had a few people ask us if the food was okay. That's a nice touch for a place like this. They even thanked us for coming in as we left. Very nice. 

Food was good, great service and friendly. Let me see, I think i will be back. Quick food and friendly people. Enjoy.
