WTF!!! Why the hell have I never been here?!! I feel soo robbed of the many disgusting Mexican food meals I have had prior to learning about this magical palace of enchantment! 
I was always wondering why the hell there is no such thing as a good Mexican restaurant in AZ. 
All the sauces were super good, salsa very fresh and tasty. The chicken for the only time in my entire life at a Mex joint was to my very surprise moist.... ewww gross word
Whats up with watery dry chicken burritos in AZ? 
I wanted to desperately eat some of the delightful sounding pork dishes but due to all the reports in the last few yrs of brain parasites being more and more frequent in the US from pork I just cant go there. I'm to fragile to handle the anxiety of, am I the rare one? Ill go nuts if I eat it, Ill think I'm dying for days later. ha ha I'm disturbed. Anyway I will be back again and again .. For non pork dishes of course. 

Oh a side note, I went to their website a while back, when it worked. All the pictures were of people making food with there bare hands no gloves. I was soo shocked it was on the website even I was scared to eat here. 
To my pleasant surprise, They were all wearing gloves, I checked it out .
