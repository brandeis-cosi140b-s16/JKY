We all have bad experiences with airport food, so no expectation at all, five of us went inside the restaurant because we had no choice, basically we were hungry and waiting for the connecting flight.

We ordered Chicken Enchiladas, Burrito, Quesadilla, chips and salsa, along with a few other drinks. To our pleasant surprise, everything was palatable. The presentation was neat, service was friendly and the food was delectable.

All of us liked whatever we ordered. And we all shared the sentiment that is it unlikely of the food that we get from other restaurants in airports.
