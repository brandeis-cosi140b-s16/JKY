I wouldn't eat at Calico Jack's but I had a lot of fun here on Friday night. I met some friends here because they won a vip happy hour. We enjoyed drink specials till 11 but even when we had to pay full price for drinks I think they were reasonably priced. This is my favorite bar at Westgate because its the only bar where you can dance and there were a lot of cute guys!
