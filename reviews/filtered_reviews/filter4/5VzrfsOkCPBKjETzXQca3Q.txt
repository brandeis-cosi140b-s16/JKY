One of my favorite places in PIT. One of the places I can take out of town folks and they all refrain "Oh, hey Pittsburgh isn't that shitty"

I love the building and the decor.  I have found the customers skew younger, but not necessarily more hip.  Other reviewers have called this a "hipster bar".  

Honey, if you think these people are hipsters, I've got some news for you.  

The service is not great even for this town.  Some of the waitresses are downright hostile.  Their attitude says "How dare you order from me in order to tip me?".  As someone who has worked in food/beverage I am continually astonished at how confrontational they are.

The tacos are great and cheap.  The vegetarian tacos were not as good as I was hoping they would be, but sticking with a meat that has been simmered in a sauce is never the wrong option.  The pork tacos tend to be better than the beef, with the pork belly as one of the stronger options.  
The salsa and chips are very good.

Would return.
