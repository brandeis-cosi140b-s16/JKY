4.5 Stars! 
I went the Canteen with a small group for happy hour and was very Happy! The happy hour was great! About half of the food menu and a third of the drink menu were included in their happy hour! BTW: where ever you see HH = happy hour:) It took me a minute to figure that out;) Their HH items are half off. 

The service was good. The 2 servers we had helping at our table were nice and fast, I just wish they had come to our table a few minutes before HH was over to let us know. I would have ordered another margarita! 

The food was really good. I had the fish tacos. Yummmy. They went perfect with my margarita! 

The restaurant was nicely decorated and clean! We sat outside and loved it! They have heaters if you need them and one of their outside tables can fit 8 people very comfortably without sitting crazy far away from each other. 

The damage: 5 margaritas, 2 orders of tacos, plus tip = $35 Not too shabby:)
