Went to this place today. Was a hefty walk to get there.  It is passed Encore a little ways.  As prior reviewers have said, there were long lines and long waits. We had a group of 3 and each person stood in a different line. The one waiting in the asada line didn't get their tacos until like 10 minutes after the other two finished eating. We had to eat outside because there was no indoor seating. Eating in 100 degree weather is not fun. 

The good part was that we highly enjoyed our meal. I had a tongue, head, shoulder and asada.  I liked the asada and shoulder best out of those. I also tasted the adoboda and chorizo. All three of us were pretty happy with our tacos. 

I give 4 stars bc of the wait and the fact we had to eat outside dripping in sweat. The food, though, was great. It's also fun watching the guys make the tacos right in front of you.
