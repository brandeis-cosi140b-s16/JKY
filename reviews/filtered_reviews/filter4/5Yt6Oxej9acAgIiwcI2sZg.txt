I really like the tacos. But the cochinita pibil is just okay. I had been here several times and  I just had one bad experience at the bar, I went by myself and two guys behind the counter didn't seem to want to help out. They even helped other people that arrived later before me and I think it was so wrong because they looked at me and talked to each other in Spanish and didn't want to take my order.
The rest of the times was good! But that was kind of a sad experience.
