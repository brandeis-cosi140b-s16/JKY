We like this restaurant more for the atmosphere. It's fun to bring out of town guests or large parties because you can sit outside by a pond with ducks. It has an old Hacienda feel to it which is nice for people not familiar with the Arizona desert. There is also a mariachi band that walks from table to table which adds to the ambiance. The food is pretty good but not the BEST Mexican food I have had. (I have had better Mexican at Carolina's) It's good enough though if you want to go somewhere romantic or fun for a large group. The service is always pretty decent as well. We're fans!
