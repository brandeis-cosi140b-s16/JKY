Food is solid if you know what to order and the restaurant has a nice casual vibe. The carne asada nachos are killer, and the house rice with chorizo and pineapple is super tasty. I ordered the mushroom quesadilla, which was too rich for me, but I tried a short rib taco off my friend's plate and it was yummy.
