So this was my first visit and the restaurant is so quaint. The atmosphere so relaxing. And the patio perfect for a beautiful day. My fianc√© and I did the hangover cure. This is 3 dishes and 1 cocktail each for $20each. Good deal. We had the huevos rancheros, carnitas skillet, and corn bread fried Benedict. The bene-awesome. The carnitas-flavorful. The huevos-saucy. So much sauce so get SOS. But delish still. Bryan took care of us and didn't seem irritated at all when I asked if he could do the dish SOS. Had good food. Good fun. Great cocktails. Bloody Mary hits the spot. Try the frozen passion fruit cocktail. Sooooo yum.
