I don't do seafood, so most of the menu is off limits for me; however, I love the burrito verde and the Baja veggie wrap. Both are great, unusual vegetarian options. 

The environment is laid back and funky, and the service is pretty good even on nights when it gets busy...and it DOES get busy, especially on the weekends. I recommend lunches if you don't want to wait, although it is one of the best areas of town to find yourself stuck waiting for a table. 

It's great for a date, and not great for kids (unless you have very adventurous, patient kids...). My niece was hungry and cranky and didn't enjoy her food. The grownups were happy, but really...is anyone happy if the kids aren't happy?

In the end, this place gets extra credit just for incorporating "Fish Taco" into their name. I can't say it without giggling like Butthead.
