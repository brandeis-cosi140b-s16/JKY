Just a quick update since I returned to the scene of the crime with an even larger and more wait staff harassing crew...
Previously, it was advertised that the Tuesday special was "all you can eat tacos."  This is what the restaurant calls it, but it there are actually some caveats added to the deal even though I saw no asterisk anywhere.
Apparently, it is all you can eat between four and ten tacos.  After that there is a $1 per taco surcharge.  I believe this was added after a sasquatchian sized fella came in and set the record by eating SEVENTEEN tacos in one sitting.  Guh...
And the wait staff gets better the more you regular the joint.  We had Hannah last night who didn't mind being called Montana or that we harassed her for throwing out every old catch phrase for saying "okay," with the exception of  "cool beans."  She kept the $2.50 Tecates coming as we all got out of there fat and happy for under twenty bucks...
