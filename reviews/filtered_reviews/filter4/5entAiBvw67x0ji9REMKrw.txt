Z'Tejas is a margarita orgy. Virtually every imaginable beverage combination has been infused with tequila. Reading through their drinks menu is as intoxicating as the actual drinks.

I happened to be in Scottsdale this past Friday because I was filling in at our branch there. Just like last Friday when the Biltmore office desperately needed me to come by and fill in, this work day was tragically slow. What better way to alleviate my boredom than imbibing at a local establishment? Dani, who is quickly becoming my new post-work drinking buddy, emailed me and suggested Z'Tejas. I'm excited to report that this was an excellent choice.

Dani ordered the Sky Pineapple Vodka and soda. Since there was less than a shot left, they didn't charge her for the cocktail, which is cool and appropriate as I sampled it and couldn't take any alcohol. I ordered the ginger pomogranate margarita. Heavenly!! Truly spectacular!! It was the pefect combination of not-too-sweet and a solid background bite of ginger. It's going to be the cocktail I'm going to attempt to perfect at home, which basically translates to "I'm going to be spending a lot of nights drunk until I get this right." But, I believe in doing my part to help the economy any way possible, and the liquor department at local grocery stores certainly could use the help. Right?

We ordered an appetizer because I knew with a 3 margarita maximum they weren't kidding around with the strength of their drinks. The Tejas Trio was tortilla chips, guacamole, salsa and queso. All were good but the guac was made the way I like it (the way Robert makes it) with solid chunks of avocado and a good amount of jalapeno for that after-burner effect.
