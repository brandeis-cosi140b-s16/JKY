This was good Mexican food. I decided to try something I had never had before (I forget what it was called) and I was glad I did. My wife ordered a torta, and raved about the bread. La Unica is a little out of the way for us, but worth it if we are in the mood for Mexican. It was fast and relatively inexpensive.
