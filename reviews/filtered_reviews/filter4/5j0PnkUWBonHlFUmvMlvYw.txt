Just finished up scarfing down some chicken from here. I discovered(thank you yelp) this place about a month ago. Every so often I decide that I want to swap out the chicken I usually have with something new and exciting and this does it for me.

I've had the pleasure of trying both the steak and chicken. I've also nabbed a taste of the standard sides.

The menu is very simple chicken/beef/combo offered in 1/4 1/2 or whole. All meals come with beans, marinaded onions, house made salsa, warm corn or flour tortillas. They do offer rice and a few other al a carte sides.

The gentlemen manning the grill deserves an award for the magic he performs daily. 

Chicken:
Very Mexican influenced marinade. Heavy on the garlic, black pepper, and citrus. Pair that with the smokiness you get from charbroiling something over a real fire and its as good as your imagining it. They also add an unnatural bright red dye to it. Not sure exactly why they do this but whatever its.. umm.. festive?

Steak:
Delicious grilled carne asada just as it should be. The beef has just enough fat to keep it moist without being greasy.

Salsa:
I don't love it but only because I don't like fresh tomatoes. They puree fresh tomatoes to create the salsa. Everyone who has tried it loves it. Just not something I ever like anywhere.

Beans:
Whole pinto beans. Hard to say if they are home made or canned. I would guess they are probably canned but still good and not overly salty.

Flour Tortillas:
Warm, soft, mmmmm.

Onions:
They are pickled/marinaded which takes away some of the sharpness of the raw onion. Great addition to your hand made burritos.


If you find yourself in the area and are hungry do yourself a favor and grab a quick meal here. Don't forget cash because they don't accept plastic.
