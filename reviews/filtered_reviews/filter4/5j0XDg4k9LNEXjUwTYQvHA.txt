The Tee Pee has been our favorite Phoenix haunt for 27 years - my husband's for 30-plus. We love the food and atmosphere. No pretentions. Good food reasonably priced. We flew in this weekend for a bittersweet trip. Figured we'd race to the Tee Pee for old time's sake. Plane arrived at 9:10. At the restaurant by 9:55, but alas, too late. Not quite. Ryan (grandson of the founder) served us a couple of beers and chips and salsa. It was wonderful. The crew was so generous with their time. We've no reason to come back to come back to Phoenix, but will route the occasional trip through Phoenix for a trip to theTee Pee. This place is an institution that is worthy of its reputation and following.
