Ah San Felipe's...I'm surprised by your somewhat horrible star rating. Perhaps most Yelpers don't share the same affinity for you that I do from my ASU days? That's okay, to each his/her own! So okay, is this the best Mexican food in the world? No. But is it one of those places that's totally College fun? Yes! It's always a good time, they have live entertainment and events not to mention their sol-a-rita (Margarita with Sol beer in it) is pretty great...then again I'm a sucker for anywhere that has a beergarita. The service is usually pretty decent and I love that it's in Tempe marketplace so you can get some shopping on before or after. I always have a good time when I come here. This is one of those places that it's not so much about the food and more about the fun. I recommend San Felipe's if you're looking for a good place to hang out and day drink but not if you're looking for fantastic Mexican food. Although, I like their food! But I judge Mexican food based on how much melted cheese it has so take that into consideration! :-)
