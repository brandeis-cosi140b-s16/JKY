I have seen this restaurant maybe 250 times, my aunt lives around the corner. So my husband and I were in the neighborhood and wanted Mexican food, we were on our way to La Canasta on 7th street but they do not have strong drinks so I suggested we stop in.  When you enter it feels like you have been transported to a little Villa. So we sit down the place is half full. There was this man literally licking his plate,  I was thinking damn is the food that good.  So we ordered beer ritas. We asked our waiter about the hottest dish they had.  He pointed out a couple but they had spicy boneless ribs on the menu so I asked, "what kind of Mexican restaurant has ribs?" He said it was not Mexican it is New Mexico cuisine.  I was thinking in my head what is the difference, because he said it with so much pride.  So I studied the "New Mexico" menu and order a burrito...lol. my husband got some spicy Shrimp dish. The chips and salsa came out with the beer ritas which only come frozen. The salsa was so spicy and delicious maybe top 3 salsa I have ever eaten.  The drink was full of goodness. The food came out quick.  It was so goood and I added that spicy salsa it was over the top. Then the bill came it was 19.00. I thought it was a mistake. I asked my husband to guess how much he said 50.00. We were thrilled.  We saw a couple eating sopapias spelling my b off. So we ordered some they were fresh and sweet and good and...you get the picture.  I will be back for sure.
