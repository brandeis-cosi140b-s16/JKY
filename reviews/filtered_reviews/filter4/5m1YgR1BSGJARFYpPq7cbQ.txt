Ate last week at the Gallo Blanco and everything was great.  Drinks, food, atmosphere y todo.  

To start we had an order of ceviche and two drinks, prickly pear and sueno mojado margaritas.  The drinks were good and the ceviche was spot on.  For our meal we decided to split the five tacos on the menu, as well as the oaxaca tamale.  The halibut taco was good, carne asada taco was good, shrimp taco was good, cochinita pibil taco was very good and the veggie taco was excellent.  The oaxaca tamale we ordered was was fantastic, the maza was perfect and the filling was amazing.  They make a great tamale, there is no question about it.  I was not expecting to enjoy my meal as much as I did and left quite satisfied.
