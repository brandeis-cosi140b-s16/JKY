What can I say?  Mexican food is my weakness.  I have walked by this place about 100 times but never at the right time for a meal.

The other day it was around dinner so we stopped in, it's not fancy and the menu is written on a chalkboard.  I decided on a chicken taco salad and my better? half decided on a chicken burrito.  I LOVED that guacamole and sour cream didn't cost extra cause avocados are another weakness of mine.  The salad was delicious.  Lettuce was fresh, chicken was good and plentiful, cheese, and all other toppings were good.  It didn't come in one of the those pre fried taco bowls either, instead just with a tortilla they crisped up right before serving it.

There's a little bar of different flavors of salsa, I only tried the mildest one cause I'm a baby but they all looked fresh and homemade.  This will definitely be in the repetoire of places to walk to for dinner!
