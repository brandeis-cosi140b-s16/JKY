I went here for happy hour with my coworkers and had a great time. The margaritas were quite good, and they have a great selection of tequilas. If you like raspberry-flavored things, definitely ask for the Chambord margarita. It's not on the menu, but after our server recommended it to us, we couldn't turn it down. The tacos aren't my Mexican mother-in-law's tacos, but they're fine. Overall, if you like tequila and margaritas, definitely get a group together and give this place a try for happy hour.
