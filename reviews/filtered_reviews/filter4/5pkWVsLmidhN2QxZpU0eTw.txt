Yum!  In the mood for a laid back place with great, fresh food? If so, head into PV Burger Company... that's exactly what I did.  Had the bacon cheeseburger and sweet potato tots with street corn on the side.  The burger was cooked perfectly.  It was juicy and fresh, served with crispy bacon, good sauce, and cucumber slices on top, which I thought was a nice touch.  It took a few minutes to get to me, but the place was busy and I knew my food was being cooked just for me, so I was ok with it.  The street corn was a bit overdone, but the tots were good, and I'm not a huge fan of sweet potato.

I'm looking forward to popping in again soon and trying this brule burger everyone is raving about... yum, yum, yum!
