Matta's has a unique charm that keeps me coming back. I love that it's rich with history and has overcome so many obstacles to be serving food in Mesa again. 

The service depends on who you get at your table, I've had amazing service and some pretty bad- but I always take it in stride. Nothing bad enough to keep me from coming back. As long as they keep the fresh chips and salsa coming, I'm happy.

Their dishes are simple Americanized Mexican food done right, complimented by inexpensive yet tasty margaritas. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming and they employees seem genuinely happy to be there. You can sometimes even catch a live Mariachi band performing upstairs!

It's a solid choice for dinner at Mesa Riverview, and worth the drive from another part of town.
