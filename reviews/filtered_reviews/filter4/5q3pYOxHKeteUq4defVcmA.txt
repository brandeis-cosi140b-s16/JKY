I sometimes feel like I give too many 4 star reviews, but this place really was quite good. So we'll call it 3.5 rounded up to 4. We came here for a friend's engagement party. It's a bit hard to find, and be prepared for the parking situation to be hairy. I would just keep a few bucks of cash on me so that you can just make use of the complimentary valet.

It's a neat setup- I think its' 3 different restaurants in one building. Our reservation was for quite a bit later, but we were able to wait in the outside bar area, where we hung out and had some drinks before being seated. They did graciously try to work us in early- something we very much appreciated, given that it was Saturday and we had a big group.

The food was really great. The whole diet thing kind of gets in the way of true blue Mexican food (Rokerij specializes in New Mexico Tex-Mex) but I wound up getting their peppercorn steak. Incredible. It's a super tender cut of sirloin balanced on a slab of french bread, and the whole plate is drenched in this savory, creamy, not too peppery sauce. OMG incredible. My husband got another steak as well, and it was also really good. I asked for rare and got mine pretty bloody, so that was great. Didn't get to taste anybody else's items about the table, but everybody seemed pretty satisfied.

One last tip- the online menu is not super accurate. They have a pretty great specials menu scribbled on a chalkboard- there were very many things on there that I was tempted by that did not show on their online menu. So keep an open mind when you go.
