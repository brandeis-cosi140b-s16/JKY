Well overcrowded.  I had to fight to get a spot at the bar, then had to fight to get a chair to go with my spot.  While eating I had to dodge people grabbing drinks and paying tabs.  A young stylish crowd.  

The food and drink were outstanding.  This might be worth 5 stars for those that get a table reservation.  Well worth a visit.
