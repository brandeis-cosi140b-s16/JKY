Fish Tacos: 1 Star; Restaurant: 4 Stars

We decided to check out some shops in Cave Creek Sunday afternoon and thought this place looked like a nice spot for lunch. We started with two DOS XX while we waited for a patio seat. 

After being sat, they came with the chips and salsa's. I LOVED the chips. I liked the choice of salsa's, but good thing Dave quickly tried the green one because it had avocado (allergy alert!). It would have been nice if they asked if we had been there before and explained the salsa's. The reds were good. We ordered a small portion of fish tacos (grilled) and the Carnita's. The small portion of the fish tacos was one taco, rice and beans, which I thought would be plenty. 

When the food came, I was disappointed with the taco. The piece of fish was about 2" long and 1/2" think...skimpy!  it was this small piece of fish in a tortilla, the cabbage was on the side. The only sauce they served with it was a cilantro butter, which I asked for on the side because I am not a huge fan of cilantro. It was ok, I did try some on the taco. I created my wimpy taco and tasted it. It had decent flavor, but I really wasn't getting into it. Of course I ate the whole thing. If you read my other reviews, I like the fish deep fried, and that wasn't an option. 

It was served with black beans w/melted cheese and rice. I am not a bean fan, and I am less of a fan of black beans; however, these were good. I did eat some. Now, I really enjoyed the rice - it had flavor! 

I also had a Carnita - good flavor, not excellent, but definitely good!   

The service was great. I wasn't a fan of the facility layout; however, I did like the decor and the 'private booths' along the pond. They have a nice 'family story' that I would love to re-write as a marketing person and I would like to try some other dishes on the menu, so we will probably be venturing back another time. Plus - I did love those chips!
