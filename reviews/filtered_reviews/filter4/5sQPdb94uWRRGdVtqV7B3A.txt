I went there for the first time last night. I made a reservation online which was nice because you didn't have to try to call in or wait when you got there. The food is good and the service was great. They give you bread at your table which is a little different then chips from what I am use to at southwestern food but it was good. I tried the dumpling appetizer it was good!!
