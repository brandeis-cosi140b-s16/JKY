The back patio at Frank and Lupes is such a gem to have in old town. As you walk down a small alleyway, you feel like you're walking in to a small family owned restaurant in a coastal town in Mexico. You're surrounded by walls painted with murals, a small bar, old school hanging corona signs, and not to mention great food. Really... nothing beats eating good Mexican food under the stars.

What I personally recommend:

Get the #1, it's the combination plate. It comes with a pork tamale, a rolled enchilada, a taco, rice, beans, and two sopaipillas. What I do is ask to sub the taco to a chicken taco. I also get my plate covered in red sauce. Ask for a side of salsa with your #1 to dip or pour on top.

Their chips and salsa are great. Many times I get served chips right out of the fryer in my basket. Their salsa is fantastic, and it's very fresh. One of my favorites in AZ. The only downside is their change in policy. In the past you used to get unlimited baskets of chips. Now you get 1 free basket, and I think every basket after that is $2.50. This is crazy in my mind, chips should be free. I asked one server why they started to charge, and he said it's because many people would just leave the chips on their table without touching them. What a weak excuse! Instead of charging, just ask initially if they would like chips. Their policy is just to get extra money...

Frank and Lupes gets 5 stars for food, 3.5 stars for service, and 2 stars for their policy. Their food is really good, so I cannot give this place anything lower than a 4.
