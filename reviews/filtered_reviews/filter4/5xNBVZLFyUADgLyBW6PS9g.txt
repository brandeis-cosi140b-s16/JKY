This is the place for Tortas In Phoenix AZ 
Always really constant with the every order, I seen it all I been going to this restaurant even before it became Los Reyes that was back in 2000 when I was barely 13 years old. This is more like my family restaurant even though they don't eat bread anymore. But it has a friendly atmosphere but in the last 3 years or so the service gone really slow and a bit rude I don't know why. But now I just order ToGo instead I love there food
