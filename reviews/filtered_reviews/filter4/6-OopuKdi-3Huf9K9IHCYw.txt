This is for takeout only.  Will reassess dine-in at some later point.  This Korean Mexican fusion really fills a culinary niche that I know will leave me with a very specific craving in the future.  Good size portions at a reasonable price.  I had the burrito w/chicken.  Adding a touch of he Korean sauce made for a delicious meal.  For you vegetarians, I understand that the veggie tofu fried rice is really good!
