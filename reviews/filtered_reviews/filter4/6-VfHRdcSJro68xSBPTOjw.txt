If you want it spicy here's your spot.  Even though they just opened the food was great.  Still getting everything together but I was impressed.  

Salsa bar was on point.  Lot's of flavor, even more spice.  They offer some sour cream if you want to cook it down a little.  I liked the chipotle and the Serrano the best. 

I had the steak.  Tons of flavor, fresh ingredients. 

The queso fundido was okay.  A little too think for my taste. 

I will return, no question.
