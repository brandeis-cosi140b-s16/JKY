I live literally 3 minutes away from this place and it's one of my go to stops for a great burger. Since they were on diners, drive in and dives, this place has gotten a lot busier. The customer service is still outstanding and the burgers are awesome.  I am a fan of this place and I recommend you try one of their speciality burgers.  They also have outstanding milk shakes. This place is also next to my favorite pizza joint, Isa's, so if you are looking for a slice of pizza, stop by there for some good pizza.
