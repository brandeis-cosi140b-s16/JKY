The salsa is probably the only reason to go here, the service was pretty good too, lot of water and chips refills.  The food is mediocre I would say but alot better than places that end in "tos".

I go back just for the salsa and the fact that pretty much every mexican food place in AZ is not that good at all, so Los Dos wins.
