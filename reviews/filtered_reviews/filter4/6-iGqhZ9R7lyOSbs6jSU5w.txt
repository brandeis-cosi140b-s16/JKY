My husband and I went on a long hike nearby and yelped for something quick and delicious when we were done. I recognized Reynas from Man vs. Food, so we decided to give it a try. We weren't disappointed. The frescos and totras were amazing! Perfect for after hiking! 
We live in Seattle and have nothing that compares. The servers were so sweet and took great care of us, the food was delivered very quickly.
I can't wait to return and try the ceviches. We will definitely be back next time we are in town.
