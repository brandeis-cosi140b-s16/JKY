Took my son there for lunch as I'd heard a whole lot about Nando's from my colleagues at work. And when i found out there was a a Chandler location, I wanted to check it out. I loved their decor with the Mexican ceramic tiles! So colorful. Even the ladies room was done up with the tiles! Yes, it was very clean too :)

Their chips and salsa were fabulous!!! I has to ask them to take the chips away from me! 
The entrees were huge! Seriously big platters! I had gotten the 2 enchilada platter - and I had rice and veggies with it. Those grilled veggies were seriously delish! The enchiladas were good too - but nothing to super rave about. Maybe next time I should try a speciality rather than a standard menu item.
I don't drink so can't tell you about their alcoholic beverages but people were at the bar - at 3pm on a weekday if that gives you any indication ;)

My son and I both enjoyed the food and our afternoon at Nando's!
