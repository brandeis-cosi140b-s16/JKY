The margaritas at Don Casa Juan Mexican restaurant we're not bad. I ordered the strawberry margarita and my friends ordered a Cadillac watermelon margarita. They brought us free chips, beans, and salsa to go with our margaritas. The staff was very friendly and we received a free picture of us. Next time we come back to this restaurant we will have to eat a meal.
