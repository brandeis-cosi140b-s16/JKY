Being from a Puerto Rican and Mexican family, I enjoy authentic Mexican food. Food here is great. Large menu with many choices and combo plates. Servers are quick to bring refills on chips, salsa, or drinks. My first time here was at dinner time and aside from the lighting not being that great, everything else was perfect. I felt just like family and welcomed by everyone working there. Being from CA, I have had many different types of Mexican food from numerous places. This place is definitely a go to when I'm craving Mexican food. 
Only downfall in my opinion, which is why I did not give them 5 stars, is because of their parking lot situation. Very few spots to park in. Luckily my first time here it wasn't too busy. But the second time I came here, there were no spots and nearly had to battle someone else for an open spot when someone left. 
Definitely will be back again.
