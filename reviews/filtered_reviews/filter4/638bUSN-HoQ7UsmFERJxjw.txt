Good people get high reviews.  We went to Burrito Shack over the holidays, and the employees there were fantastic and friendly.  Honestly, the burritos were so-so.  We are from New Mexico, so we do lots of Mexican - I thought the plain burrito with red chile was awesome.  The rest seemed really dry.  "Carne" is carne aside, not carne adovada - a substantial letdown, but probably my fault for assuming based on my New Mexico roots.  Overall - it was good.  I will go back again, I am sure.
