Love this place! Really nice staff, competent servers, delicious food. (And very reasonably priced! Bonus.) My kiddos love anything that involves beans and rice and this restaurant is within walking distance from our house. Perfect. Endless chips and salsa for the kids and a margarita for mama. Does it get any better than this?

My husband and I have also ordered take out and were pleased with that as well. The other night I really just wanted to order chips and salsa to munch on while watching March Madness, I had no need for a huge meal - much to my surprise I could order an individual taco for $4. I ordered the crispy shrimp taco in a crispy corn taco shell, my husband ordered a veggie quesadilla (Friday during Lent for all you Catholics out there...no meat!) and our grand total came to $14. This $14 included a HUGE bag of crispy chips and two kinds of salsa. I felt a little guilty paying less than $15 for dinner! But I got over it.

Thumbs up! It always looks busy so I guess people keep coming back. If you haven't given it a try, I recommend you check it out.
