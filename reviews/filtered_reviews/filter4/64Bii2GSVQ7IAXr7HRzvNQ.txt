Ordered the grande nachos. HUGE! Eating vegetarian in Vegas is usually easy.. So I asked if there was a way to make the nachos vegetarian and indeed there was. You can have them put the meat on the side, which works great if you're with people that do eat meat. My parents chose the chicken and said it was flavorful and cooked well. They we're definitely worth trying. I was also told you can order tacos with beans instead of meat and they have a vegetable wrap :) 

*My mom wanted to get breakfast and ordered scrambled eggs with cheese, home fries and sausage patties with sourdough toast. She said it was just a normal breakfast. Tasty but nothing special.
