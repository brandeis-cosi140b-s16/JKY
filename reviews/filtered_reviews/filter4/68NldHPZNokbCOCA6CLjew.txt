I finally had a chance to go here a couple of weeks ago. Overall, I liked the place. The person at the counter was very friendly. They weren't overly busy, but almost every seat was taken. It really did seem like a street taco joint you would find in Mexico, basic seating, little decor, some selection of drinks. 

Next Positive - CHEAP - $2.00 for an authentic fish taco. Awesome. I ordered two, grabbed a drink and waited for only a few short minutes for my order. First off, I noticed they did a marinated cabbage mixture on the taco, instead of just raw cabbage. I really liked this, they stepped out of the norm. Unfortunately, I didn't particularly care for the flavor of the cabbage, (but that was because of my tastes, not because of their efforts), but with the fish it gave the entire thing a nice flavor. And I had no problem eating them both us in about 2 minutes. Good Stuff! 

They also give you caramelized  onions with your. I love caramelized onions and ate them all. This was an extra touch I hadn't seen. I am sure my breath wasn't all that fantastic, luckily I wasn't going back to an office meeting, but boy were they good!  

My only negative - I was still hungry - and this was probably my fault, I walked in starving. So I ordered a shrimp taco. The shrimp was marinated in a lime juice mixture, again a touch I liked, I just didn't care for it all that much. It was good, it just isn't my thing. 

They are on the main street, but if you blink you would drive right by, so you will need to look for the place. Good food, great service. I will be visiting them again soon!
