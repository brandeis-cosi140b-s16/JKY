Not bad, my first time in Vegas and we stopped by to grab some luck before heading back to work. 
Food was good. 
We ordered some chips and guacamole, the chips were nice and crispy and still warm. 
Tacos were ok, nothing special. We also ordered a sope, and that's was also good. 
The place is nice and clean, not a lot of customers. 
I really liked the customer service, the guy serving us was very attentive and courteous. 

The restrooms were also very clean. 
I would come back again.
