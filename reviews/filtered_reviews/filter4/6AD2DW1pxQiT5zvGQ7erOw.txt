La Ristra is a new, family owned restaurant that has some growing pains.  The owners are aware of the negatives and are working to address them.  I ate lunch there today, after driving by many times.  The location sucks with no direct way to get to or from the restaurant.  The decor of the restaurant is very nice - they've done a lot of work and have a nice, clean facility.  The wait staff was polite and attentive.  One of the owners came by several times to check on things.  The food was good.  The enchiladas were tasty but the black beans were very bland - kind of like right out of can with a little melted cheese on top.  They have a happy hour that sounds pretty good.  I support local, non-chain restaurants and will give this one a second visit in a month or so after they have the time to smooth out the rough edges.  I recommend you give it a try!
