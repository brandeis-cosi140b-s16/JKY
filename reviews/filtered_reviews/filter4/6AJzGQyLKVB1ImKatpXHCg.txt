First place we ate after we settled in our hotel. Located on the floor level of the Hard Rockl, this place has the same feeling as a Chili's or Red Robin environment wise. Casual and neon lights. After our flight we were starving and decided to have lunch here. I love street tacos and the sight of the pink tortillas was a big draw for me. We ordered Zonkey Fries, and numerous tacos. 

The Zonkey fries were steak fries topped with carne asada and cheese and pico. Very good was to start our meal off! The tacos come in orders of 3, 6 or 9. The pink tacos are their specialty consisting of black beans, grilled chicken, salsa arbol, pickled onion and avocado inside their signature pink corn tortilla. They tasted very good, I love seeing something so pretty before I eat it and that was what it was. The flavor was good, but the visual was more appealing. Recommend it! We also had an order of the Al Pastor tacos, which was rotisserie pork topped with pineapple salsa in a regular corn tortilla. This was also a good choice for us. Tasty! Recommend it if you are in the Hard Rock Hotel!
