My husband and I go to Jalepeno's at least twice a week. We love the salsa, food and the service. Our favorite waitress Samatha always is so cheerful and full of life. Knows exactly our drink order. Even if we are not in her section she brings our drinks before we even order them from another waiter. She is very personable. The fajitas are awesome. And the enchiladas are terrific. We really have never had a bad meal there.  We always enjoy our meals there.
