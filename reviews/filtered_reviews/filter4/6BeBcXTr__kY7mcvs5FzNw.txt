Large portions of yummy Mexican at a reasonable price is great! 2 people could really share a 3 item combo along with chips and salsa that are INCLUDED..We had strawberry marguerita as our appetizer and they were good too! We have been going since it was Super Med and it continues to please. Watch for the several 2 for coupons they offer in the Entertainment Book.
