The food is fantastic and I've come here for years.  My boyfriend also can never get enough of this place.  I love the fact that its unique to Phoenix which is why I always take visitors here.  They are also generous with samples.  I would not change anything about the food.  I wish the ambiance was a little nicer though.  Maybe a repainted wall here or there or new tables or chairs??
