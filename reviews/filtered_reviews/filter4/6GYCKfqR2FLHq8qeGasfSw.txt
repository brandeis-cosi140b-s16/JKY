It's spelled Chile if you are referring to NM chiles. Other than that my lunch was very good! I ordered the adovado enchiladas with red and green and a fried egg. The egg was perfect, the adovado was the most tender I've ever had and I've eaten plenty in NM. The chile was hot but still not like eating it in NM but I'm very particular about chile. The kids were happy with bean & cheese burros and a cheese crisp. The salsa was hot but too salty. Dos XXs on draft. Waitress was fine. Decor tried to be too NM while spelling chile as chili which was annoying. I have to say it was very pricey (IMO)  about $12 per plate kid's burro $6.95. Overall good experience.
