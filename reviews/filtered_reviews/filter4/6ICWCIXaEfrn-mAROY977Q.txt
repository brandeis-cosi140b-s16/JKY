Finally, excellent mexican food in the north valley.  Oh, Carolina's food is so good.  Starting with the tamales, both beef and green corn, which are so flavorful and cooked perfectly.  My litmus test for a mexican restaurant is red chile, and Carolina's is nice and spicy with lots of flavor.  But their tortillas are amazing.  Better than some home made I've had.  Just try one with butter and you'll have to fight chewing off your arm when the butter runs down it.  No forks needed; just a tortilla.

It can get really crowded during prime dinner time.  Mostly people waiting for take out that make it hard to maneuver in the back part of the restaurant.  Often there's a wait for a table too.  There are only about 15-20 small tables or so.  They usually keep the dining area pretty clean, and the kitchen is wide open so you can easily see that they keep it very clean and organized.

My one and only complaint is the freezing cold temp they keep it in there.  The air was ice cold in the summer, but they're still running the air conditioning ice cold in late November.  I wear a coat so as not to let the cold distract from the feasting.

Having Carolina's in this part of town is a godsend.  Yeah, I know it's been here a while and I'm late to the party.  So I guess I have a lot of tortillas to catch up on.
