We sat at the bar since it was an early dinner. We ordered off the happy hour menu - pork sliders, queso and chips and ribs.  The sliders turned out to be the worst of the bunch.  The pulled pork was a bit dry and though the bun was nice, the whole thing was bland without some kind of sauce maybe.  The queso was probably one of the best I've ever had.  The ribs fell off the bone and the seasoning was pretty tasty despite the appearance of the dish.  The wine I had was very good, the margarita my friend had was super tangy but he enjoyed it.  All in all, I'd like to explore the menu further and maybe venture to the basement.  :)
