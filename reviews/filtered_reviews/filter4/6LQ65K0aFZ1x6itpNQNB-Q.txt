Went to fat boys based off of reviews was not disappointed pizza made from scratch and completely tasty. Oven doesn't cut off til 1130 so pizzas are ready to order after 1130.  Pizza crust was incredible and it was all around great price for hi quality pizza, And i keep hearing bout boyers burgers gotta try next time.
