The vibe of this place is cool.   Too cool. Should I be here? Oh great I should.  

The feel is unparalleled in the city and the background music is my mid 90's playlist of hip hop (west side). 

The food is creative with tasty innovative takes on Guacamole.  The tacos were fine.  
Cocktails grounded in Rum instead of the over present whiskeys is refreshing.  Recommend this place more for drinks and ambience than food.
