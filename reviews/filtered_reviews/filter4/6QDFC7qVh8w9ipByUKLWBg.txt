First timer, but staff was attentive and food / drinks were real good. Sat at cabana bar and was taken care of very well. DJ was .. Umm... DJing I guess. Could take it or leave it. Plenty of mixed crowd that we're having a good time. 

Bartender pours a stiff drink and that is always appreciated. Thanks for the interesting time.
