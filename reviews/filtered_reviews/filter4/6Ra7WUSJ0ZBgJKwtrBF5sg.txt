I have not been inside the actual store yet, but their $2 tacos they cook outside rock my socks. The pork is a winner in my book. And seriously, where can you get a filling meal for just $2 (for Grandma who can't eat a  lot in one sitting), $4 (for me), or $6 (3 tacos if you like to eat a lot!). I wish they had a better selection of toppings for the tacos, but the seasoning on the meat is so good, you don't need much.
