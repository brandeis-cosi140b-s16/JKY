I had the odd coincidence of going to this restaurant two times in one week ..and I am not sad about it. Firstly, they did good by being located in Scottsdale quarter, full marks on location. Full marks on ambiance inside , full marks on service. Now on to the main thing- food. A couple of things are highly recommended- the salsa, dips, guac...al good. I absolutely loved the ceviche sol and shrimp cevice. Very fresh and an absolute explosion of flavors in your mouth. I liked it so much on a cold winter night, I can only imagine what it would be like having this in the summers. In the entrees, I loved the fish pibil and shrimp chile relleno. 
And now the not so good news- the desserts. I tried two , the creme brulee and the bread pudding....sadly not up to the mark. But overall, I recommend.
