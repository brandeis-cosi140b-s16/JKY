I came here with a friend who was in town visiting. We wanted good Mexican food after we read a few reviews we opted for this place. Upon arrival the place looked packed and walking up we were almost sure we'd have at least a 45min wait, if not longer. Maybe we were lucky but as soon as we came in we had a table available to us and we didn't feel crammed with all the people around. It was comfortable, our servers were really nice and the food was quick! And not in a bad way. We ordered a beer and a margarita and they were both good. Our server brought out a frozen glass for the beer too..even better! We both agreed we'd come back and that it was a cool place.
