It was New Year eve 2014 and our first time to try out this neighborhood caf√© as it has been highly recommended by the Auto club in its 2013 Arizona tour book for the Phoenix metro area. We ordered a seafood appetizer, the obligatory Cochinita Pibil, as it was the top recommendation by AAA, and el Pato en Tamarindo. The ambiance was excellent and the service was exceptional. 

When it comes to food, the Cochinita Pibil was a great disappointment. Cochinita Pibil is supposedly to be slow roasted pork. Such cooking process supposes to seal the fat and the juice in the meat and to prevent the meat from becoming too dry and tough and yet keeping the full natural flavor. Unfortunately, I can only describe that the "portion of pork" picked for and served in our plate as an overcooked pulled pork with a mushy texture, similar to that of sardines in a can.  If not because of the sauce, the taste itself was so bland as if the meat has been boiled in water for hours to extract flavor for broth. We left the whole plate untouched after we had the chance to sample it.

On a positive note, the appetizer and the seared duck breast saved the night. The seafood appetizer was not in the regular menu and we were told it was only offered especially for the end of the year. The texture of the shrimp and squid was crunchy and tender. The taste of the sauce was exquisite and it served with three large pieces of toast that one can dunk it into the sauce.  The duck breast was seared perfectly with enough pink. The meat was tender and juicy. The tamarind/chipotle pepper sauce had a kick with a well balance of sweetness and sourness, which complemented real well with the duck meat.
