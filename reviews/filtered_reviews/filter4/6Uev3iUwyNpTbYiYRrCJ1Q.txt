This place is pretty great. There salsa is made in house and even the margaritas on special are fresh squeezed. They are reasonably priced and have come up with some awesome flavor combinations. I had there chicken tacos, pork tacos and there fried avocado taco. The first two are perfect but the fried avocado is a little bland.  Over all they have great service as well. I would definitely recommend them, especially on their Wednesday night special.
