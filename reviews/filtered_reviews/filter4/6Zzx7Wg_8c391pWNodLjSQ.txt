A friend took me here a few weeks ago. I think I have been back 6 times. Their carne asada is awesome, as good as you can get in town. Their "Al Pastor" is the shaved rotisserie thing they have. Also delicious. The people who work there are also extremely friendly and literate too. :)
I'm a regular there now.
