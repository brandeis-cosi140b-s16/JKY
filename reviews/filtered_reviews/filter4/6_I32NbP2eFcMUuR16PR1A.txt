Where have you been hiding, Border Grill?  How have I lived in LV and missed this place for the last 7 years? 

In the span of two weeks, I found myself here for dinner and then Sunday brunch.  I feel like I should be embarrassed about this, but I have no shame.  If you force me to choose, I would say brunch is the star, but dinner was pretty fantastic too.  The chips and salsa in this town can be very hit or miss.  Border Grill's delivers.  I had chile relleno for dinner and loved it.

When I returned for brunch, I was corralled by a friend who swears their brunch is the best in town.  I am a die hard DW Bistro fan so I was prepared to set her straight.  Then I tried the chilaquiles.  And the skirt steak and eggs.  And the breakfast fries.

For $34.99, you get unlimited small plates.  The quality of the food is unexpectedly good for this price point.  Everything is fresh and the small plates allow you to try several things instead of limiting you to one large dish.  The only negative is that a few of the hot dishes did not come out piping hot, but this is likely due to the rush of people in the place.  You really cannot compare DW and Border Grill because the food, ambience and intentions are totally different.  This is a great spot for endless food options, bottomless mimosas and Mexican inspired brunch.  Can't wait to go back.
