I just went to Blanco for the first time this past weekend and I was very pleased.  It was birthday so we had a large group. OUr waiter  answered all my questions and made some great recommendations. The food is pretty spicy, so make sure that what you're in the mood for before you go. The decor is very cool and modern. Thanks for a great birthday!!
