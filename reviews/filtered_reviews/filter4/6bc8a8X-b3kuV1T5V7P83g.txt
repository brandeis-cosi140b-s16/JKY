I want to give this place 5 stars but I held back for a couple of reasons; 1 is because they don't actually serve the fire roasted chicken as a meal which they roast in front of you all night, and 2nd; because of the disorganization that seems to be pervasive when it comes to figuring out the social mores when it comes to seating in this place. I'm a fairly progressive guy and it's not like common courtesy is not in my vocabulary, but when nobody is out front to direct traffic it is hard to know when it is "ok" or "your turn" for you to claim a spot at the bar or one of the tables. Also, I'm not a big fan of being asked to "move" my seat at the bar over to accommodate another party. Wanting to be a good sport, I went ahead and picked up and moved down a few chairs but really didn't want to. Granted we were done with the food portion of the evening, but I was in the mood to sit and have another cocktail while watching the "can't have me Chicken" roasting just a few feet away. May as well been roasting  on another planet, but I digress. Now, the reason it should have been a 5-Star review; the food. The staff is very polite and well trained and can help you navigate the menu. The food we had was indescribably good. I had a wine burger that was beyond compare, and my wife had the trio of enchiladas (both must've been a special as I don't see it on the online menu). Our taste buds may never recover!  Drinks were perfectly prepared which is a rarity in this town for some reason. Also, I know it shouldn't matter, but the bathroom situation is a little funky (though very nice itself) whereas I don't like to walk through the dish room/storage area to get to it. Also no outside signage seems like a too cool thing, but it's just kind of gimmicky after a while. Extra points for the "No Kardashians" sign inside the bar however.
