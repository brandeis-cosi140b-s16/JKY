Fish tacos are oh so amazing!!!

I have to eat here at least once a week. The food is fresh. The prices are fair. The guys are great. Everything I've tried has been excellent! I love the habanero salsa too- nice and hot!

Look, some people complain that they wait too long for their food to be prepared. If you want FAST food then try Burger King down the road. I'll wait 10 minutes for my fresh food.

As far as service... they are all so friendly! I always have a great time here!
