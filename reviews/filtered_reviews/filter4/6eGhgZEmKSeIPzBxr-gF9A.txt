One of the best views overlooking the Vegas valley. This restaurant has multi-level seating which leaves a lot of seating to enjoy the view. The staff is always friendly and smiling. They have a decent lunch menu and good happy hour prices. I had the chicken enchiladas with rice and beans, and my partner in crime had a taco salad with grilled chicken. I would visit this restaurant again
