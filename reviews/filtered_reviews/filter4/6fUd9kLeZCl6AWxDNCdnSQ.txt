I am actually very surprised at all the not so great reviews of this place, I know that initial reaction is, " Oh Raymond, you must not know good Mexican when it slaps you in the face." My response is this, " the food can't be good if its slapping you in the face and I really do know me some Mexican food. This was one of those places that we pass all the time when walking to the movie theater or the players club and have not given it a second thought. One Sunday we were on our way home from our church that is on Dean Martin and my wife was craving Mexican food so I decided we should hit the one in the southpoint.

We walked into the southpoint and headed to our buddy Miguels, The lady at the door/counter seated us and off we went. One of the servers brought us the starters, I obviously expected chips and salsa but instead we received Chips, Salsa, Guacamole and bean dip, Whoa hold the train here, " Um, I did not order this" I know sir it comes with the meal.. Yes, Miguel scored. we then cracked open the menu and see the amazing combo, $8.95 for two items, Fideo, beans, rice and a Drink, yes this means alcoholic drink and we are not talking bills gambling hall .99 margaritas these are adult sized. 

The food came out and everything on my plate was awesome, from the beans to the taquitos, it was all hot and fresh and tasted as authentic as you could expect at a casino Mexican joint. If it was in my kitchen that would be a different story. But for $8.95 you just cant beat it.  The service was great, the food was great and it definitely makes you want to return.
