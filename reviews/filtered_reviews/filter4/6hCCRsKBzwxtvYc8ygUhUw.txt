My husband and I were on our way home from Vegas, and we decided to stop in Phoenix for lunch. We intended to go to another restaurant, but I stopped when we drove by Gadzooks. I didn't even have this place bookmarked, but I remembered hearing about it in the New Times.

I'm glad we came after the lunch rush because I might have frozen up from all the choices. I went with the spinach/mushroom and potato enchiladas on the corn/flour tortillas and topped them with green sauce, pickled onions and guacamole. I like that they are broiled right in front of you so they're still piping hot at your table. The tangy green sauce was great, and I liked both fillings, especially the sinful potatoes. My husband got three different meat tacos; his favorite was the bison. The tortillas don't really hold up for tacos, though. His started falling apart after a few bites so he ended up eating them as enchiladas. 

I'm more than ready to go back and try more of the options.
