This is a great spot for North Scottsdale.  There is nothing more than $10.  The taco trio is really good.  Comes with rice and beans.  I always have at least one mahi mahi.  Love it.  I also like the Mahi platter is I want a little less carbs.  Antonio is awesome he makes great margaritas which are really a deal.   Their happy hour is one of the more generous in town, it is until 8pm.  Another great thing is that they are open late.  Everything around our neighborhood closes around 9pm.
