I heard about this place at Triple C on Cinco de Mayo and figured that was just as good as a day as any to give it a go... Super glad that I did... 

Clearly, as it was May 5th, the place was slammed... The upside to this being a solo mission?  No waiting for a table... I just pulled up to the bar and perused the snazzy menu... I met a nice guy named Joe who told me that the shrimp tacos were really good... I wasn't really all that hungry because of the ridiculously tasty and filling brunch I'd just had at Vida, so I didn't want a whole big platter... I noticed that they do a singular taco option, though!  Perfect... :)  The couple beside me (in from Greensboro and completely sweet) also heard Joe recommend the shrimp tacos and echoed his endorsement... I figured I'd give it a go, then... I decided on the broccoli with queso and one shrimp taco...

They're called the Shake Down Shrimp and I'm not really sure why, but who cares at this point?  They were amazing... They apparently make their own tortillas and that was a tasty base, the fillings are fried shrimp, shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, cilantro, chipotle ranch and Cholula (hot sauce)... Now, I just started to eat shrimp, but I am still a no-go on ranch, so I had mine without the sauce... I guess that would have cooled down the spiciness of the dish, but I was loving the heat factor...  The herbs, cabbage and pico all tasted fresh and delightful... The cabbage had a really nice crunch... The broccoli, you know, tasted like broccoli... That queso was insane, though... A total blanket of cheesiness with a minute fiery kick... 

The bartenders were attentive and friendly... Even while they were slammed with all the people surrounding the bar and filling the restaurant's orders... I can't wait to go back and actually enjoy sitting down in this place for a while... There's something called a Firestarter margarita (with jalapeno infused tequila) that has my name on it...
