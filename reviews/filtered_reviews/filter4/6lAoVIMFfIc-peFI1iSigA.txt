Sometimes I NEED Mexican food and have had some of the best I think (when in Santa Barbara don't miss La Super-Rica Taqueria, when in LA it's La Seranata on Pico in West LA-it's cheaper than the original downtown and just as good).

After living in Mexican food wilderness (New York) for about 10 years my girlfriend and I made our way to Vegas. 

After trying several Mexican places here I stumbled upon the original Frank & Fina's on Charleston (now torn down) and followed them to their new location near Flamingo and 215. 

I've enjoyed their Tampaquena, Chile Rellanos and Enchiladas. While not the greatest on the planet Frank & Fina's is always satisfying. It's well priced and very accommodating.
