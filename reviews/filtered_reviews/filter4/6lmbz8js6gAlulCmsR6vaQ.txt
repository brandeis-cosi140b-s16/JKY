Friends who focus on hip rave about this place and i can see the appeal.  The taco fillings are on point and the fresh tortillas(i suspect stone ground) are exceptional. The service is efficient if a bit breezy, and the price, especially on Tue, was a value given the quality. It's a keeper even if it reminds you more of Marin than Ensenada
