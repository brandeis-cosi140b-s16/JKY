Went to Mango's again today, food is as good as I remember.  Had the Shrimp Burro and it was excellent.  There were 12 in our group and we had to sit outside on the benches, even with the wind blowing and the leaves falling down in our food at times, it was great.  The staff gladly grabbed us another table so we could at least all sit at a table.  Only reason they didn't get a 5 is because it is downtown Mesa and parking sucks.
