For some reason Yelp would not let me check in here while sitting at the bar but, I came here to use a $30 Groupon solo for a great drinking/eating adventure. All the drinks I had here were very good. I don't know the name of the bartender but, she kept talking to me about an adult toy webpage she is making called sex rocket and about using a Mac for everything. I had a couple types of Margaritas which were all good and a drink called rum rain which was good. For a snack I had the sonoran corn and the Queso fundido. Which were good but the chips and salsa was best. The sonoran corn was not grilled like it was supposed to be and lacked spice. Hussongs still has the best corn. 
The drinks were 5 star and food was 3. Service was good too
