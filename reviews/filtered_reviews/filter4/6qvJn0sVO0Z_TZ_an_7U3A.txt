Some super good authentic homemade Mexican food in Henderson, NV of all places!  This is no way related to the lousy restaurant chain, this places if family owned and operated.   Great sauces and salsas.  Excellent chile relleno and enchiladas.  Home-cooked style beans and rice.  Our service was great and my Dos Equis was cold.  My parents live near this place and frequent the place all the time.  Definitey a place I want to go each time I visit them...and it helps that its very close to their home.   Nothing fancy about the place inside or out, but ample seating and good prices go with the excellent food!
