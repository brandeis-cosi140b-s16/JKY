Very Good Family owned Sinaloan Style Mexican SEAFOOD Restaurant that's open everyday for lunch and dinner. Prices are reasonable I'd say the average plate price runs about $13.00. Most of the menu is seafood so plan on having seafood if you come here. 

I've been here several times over the years and I'd say most of the time but not always they start you off with a complimentary mini fish tostada that delicious with your chips and salsas.

I can vouch for the Fish Veracruzana and the Fish Poblano plates because I had them before and the fish was light ,fresh tasting and flaky. The sauce and toppings  is really what made these dishes good to me. They come with your usual rice and beans and tortillas. They have many choices in this kind of dish.

Last time I was here the place was packed and we were the only table in the place that didn't order the Molcajete so I wanted to order it this time.

The Molcajete is a boiling hot caldron filled with your choice of Diablo Hot Chipotle sauce or Tomatillo Sauce. The menu that we had reads Fish, Shrimp, and Beef. But what we received was Battered Fish, Shrimp, Beef, Chicken and Octopus. The Diablo sauce is very hot and spicy but also very tasty and I found myself adding it everything I ate. Over all I thought it was good and fun to share. It cost $22.00 and feeds at least two people. It also comes with rice , beans and tortillas. If you get the Molcajete you should eat the shrimp first because they get over cooked just sitting on the hot Molcajete as ours did. I'm not a beef person but I thought the beef came out prepared the best in this dish.

I do note you should view the photo of the building so you know what the outside looks like before you give this place a try.
