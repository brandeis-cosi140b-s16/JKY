Short Version: Great selection of Mexican food, as well as fresh produce and other grocery items, at prices that are more than reasonable.

Long Version: Having moved here recently from Southern California, seeing a Carniceria open down the street was an exciting prospect, but I expected to pay for that privilege. I was wrong: prices are as cheap, or in some cases (fresh bell peppers, some produce and butcher items) cheaper, as you'd find at Costco or Giant Eagle. 

Plus, they have all the goodies you want like Coke bottled in Mexico (real sugar! no corn syrup), Jarritos Mexican soda, and a large assortment of those delicious and hard to find items you might associate with Mexican food or things available in Southern California. This includes pre-seasoned burrito and taco meats like Al Pastor for very cheap prices.

The only imperfect thing about the whole operation is that some items that are stocked are stocked in small numbers, so occasionally you'll go back to find they're out of stock of something you were looking for, but it'll usually be there next time you go back.

Highly Recommended
