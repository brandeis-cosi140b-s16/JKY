I live and work 2 blocks away, so the minute I saw the activity in the windows in preparation for opening I was excited.  Having a cheap, tasty taco place that close was a dream.

I've been here at least 15 times and haven't been disappointed, although some of the options are better then the others.  The pork  tacos have recently passed into the sublime category, the beefs are decent.  The chicken is a decent, healthy option.  Carne Asada is meh, and the fish taco is not nearly close to good ones that I have had.  With that said they include organic cabbage and tomatoes which is a huge plus in my book.  Their flavored lemonades range from fantastic to meh.

The best part is 3 huge tacos are $4.50.  While they may not be authentic, the healthy (non greasy, organic vegatables), cheap price, and super friendly owner make this place a once a week type spot.
