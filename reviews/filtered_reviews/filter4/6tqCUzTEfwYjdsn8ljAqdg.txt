This is a fast food restaurant. It is not a sit down place where they serve you at your table. The people complaining about that don't seem to understand where they are. If you want service at your table, go to Carlos O'Briens, although their food sucks.

Here, the food is good and it is inexpensive. YOu can get enough food for under $8. Is it "authentic" or amazing? No. but it is better than Chipotle and is great for a quick meal.
