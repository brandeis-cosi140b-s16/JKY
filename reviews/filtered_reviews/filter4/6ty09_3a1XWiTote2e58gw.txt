Not quite as good as the main location, but still kicks ass!  My only critique is that they don't serve a complimentary chunky salsa along with their hot salsa.  

Get the agua fresca, try an appetizer (we like the queso dip w mushrooms) and finish with one of the many Torta options they have.  

Personally, I love anything with steak at Los Reyes.  If they cook it fresh, it's incredible and very authentic!  My wife had the steak fajita plate thing and I had the steak Torta.  Her steak was obviously fresher and hotter.. Absolutely delicious!!!  Mine was warm, but not quite as freshly cooked.  Still tasty as hell, but I wish they were more consistent.

They have some cool fresh fruit options here.  Both in the agua fresca and in their dessert options.  Not too pricy either!

NOTE:  The main location was featured on Man vs Food (Food Network),  Adam had the loaded Torta (forgot the name but you'll see it!)
