Carlsbad's patio is my favorite part of the whole place! Their patio is huge and has water running through it which makes it so fun and refreshing feeling in the desert. The staff has always been friendly here, and seating inside isn't bad either but it is really dark in there/ I can't pass up sitting on a good patio. This is a great spot for me because we live across the street so we can walk there or ride our bikes. The salsas that come with the chips & salsa are much tastier than your typical salsa (I like the green one) so I recommend getting those to munch on while you wait for your entrees. The Tesuque chicken salad is the bomb, the snapper tacos are really good, and the blue corn enchiladas were pretty good too. I want to try the Habenero burger next and I definitely want to go to brunch here one day. Two complaints are that the drinks on happy hour weren't cheap they were til like $7 (originally $9) and I wish it opened before 11am for brunch because I am usually up and hungry well before 11am which in turn, forces us to go elsewhere.
