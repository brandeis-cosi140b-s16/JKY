"Not yo momma's tacos" are my go-to. I always say I'm going to get something different but they really are delicious(as well as a bargain.) My girl always gets the wing-urrito which is a boneless buffalo wing burrito. Ingenious and tasty. This is white people Mexican at it's Pennsylvania finest. Reminds me of El Torito in California. Liz the bar tender is attentive and enjoyable. 

7 out of 10 stars. Not Charlie Trotter. Not Taco Bell. Solid grub all in all
