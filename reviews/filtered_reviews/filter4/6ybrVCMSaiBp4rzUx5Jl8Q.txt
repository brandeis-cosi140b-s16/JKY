I didn't know about this place until last Friday (valentines day)... I was very impressed of the authenticity of this restaurant; from fresh guacamole up to their delicious leche flan. My chicken mole is my only favorite Mexican dish and they simple hit my mark - very happy with it!! We'll recommend this place for sure.
