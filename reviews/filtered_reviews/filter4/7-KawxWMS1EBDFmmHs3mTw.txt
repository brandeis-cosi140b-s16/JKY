I'm happy to report that I truly enjoyed RuRu's!!  They are not your traditional Tex/Mex place but they have some great staple items along with several unique things.

I am NOT a fan of the fact that they don't offer free chips and salsa but we did order the guacamole and it was VERY good.  Small portion but done very well.

I ordered the chicken bowl and my favorite part was the cilantro queso cr√®me thing that was drizzled on top!  It was tasty and filling and the price was right!  Husband ordered the burrito and that was HUGE but also pretty good.  

I like the atmosphere, the service was relatively friendly, the food was good, the prices are good...overall a good place!  It isn't my favorite restaurant in Charlotte but I will definitely be back.  

And PS..I agree with others...the parking is brutality at its finest!  They need to figure that stuff out asap!
