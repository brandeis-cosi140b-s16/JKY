I have been a fan of Si Senor since visiting the Deming NM location a few years back. (If you are out that way I highly recommend it!)

I have been to the Chandler location several times and the food can be hit or miss. Sometimes the flavors are great, and other times just ok. Service is always excellent and the staff are very friendly. 

They always bring out a plate of warm chips and 4 different salsas. Nice!

This past visit (on a Thursday) we ordered the chicken enchiladas (with green salsa) and the chicken fajitas. The food was served hot. The enchiladas, usually smothered with salsa were a little dry and only had a little of their delicious sauce, somewhat lacking in flavor. The fajitas were also lacking in flavor. Maybe a different cook? 

The sopapillas which we always look forward to were warm, but parts of them were hard and crunchy.

I think it was an off night for them.

I rate the food as 3.5 star, and the service 4 star, so overall a 4 star rating.
