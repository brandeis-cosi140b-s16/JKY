I know a ton of people have been here already,  but I just got had my experiece recently for my birthday.  It's not #1 on my list because it's far out, but definitely worth the drive and time. 

First, I'll say I love a good margerita, a different flavored margarita (apparently from my previous review at Verde). They had a Honeydew Margarita. Pretty good. Not enough Honeydew flavor, but the alcohol content was on point. :) 

Food was very satisfying. My girlfriends and I got the combination item - 1 Taco, 1 Quesidilla,and 1 Burrito. Great section of everything plus you got both rice and beans. Everything was very tasty. I got a a chicken burrito and taco and beef burrito. I'm partial to burritos mainly because I like the sauce. This one proved to be worthy,  as well. Our table also got a Guacamole and Cheese dip to share. Nothing fancy or overly superior in taste, but always a good addition when you go Mexican. 

I liked that the location wasn't overall crowded either. Very steady for a week night but still space to sit with no wait. Only reason for a 4 was location being too far out and the margarita wasnt that sweet. I will be returning.
