This was a tough call for me. I could have just as easily and with valid reason given it three stars or, for completely different reasons, five stars. So I decided to hedge my bets and go with four.

Here's why: the food is average at best, but the ambiance is outstanding and the happy hour is superb. 

In terms of straight up Mexican cuisine, this place doesn't even approach what some other nearby spots have to offer. But, their indoor/outdoor patios are always a good time, they have great live music, and a happy hour with free munchies to boot. 

Cherry on top: their chips are awesome. They cook them in house and bring them out for free with your drink order.
