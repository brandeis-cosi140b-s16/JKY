It's always a good meal at Chevy's.  Don't let this mall restaurant fool you, it is good Mexican food!  From the time that they drop their delicious chips and salsa at your table to the moment you get your fajitas with homemade flour tortillas, you will not be disappointed.  The only reason I am giving four stars is because my steak fajita meat was a little chewy.  It could've been the cut of meat they used, but it wasn't a deal breaker.  I have to say that this restaurant is not afraid to season the food and that is what makes them so good!!
