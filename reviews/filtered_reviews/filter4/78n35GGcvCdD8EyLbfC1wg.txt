My wife and I go to Cafe Rio a few times a month with our kids.  My wife really enjoys the chicken enchiladas while I usually get the sweet  pork burrito.  Our kids really like the shredded chicken quesadilla.  We have been eating here for about a year, and have noticed the are putting less meat in their items than they did a year ago.  But, it is still very good.  Just a heads up, it can get busy at lunch time.
