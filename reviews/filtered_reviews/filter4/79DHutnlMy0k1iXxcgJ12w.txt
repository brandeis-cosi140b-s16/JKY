We had been looking for a solid Mexican place that is genuine, but in the good way.. not that other way. This place delivered. When someone asks me if I know a good Mexican restaurant, this will be my recommendation. 

It has the standard quirks that Mexican restaurants usually comes with. What quirks you may ask? You know.. the quirks. Very roomy too, check out other customers pictures. They start you off with a tasty soup, that I only can imagine that is free. The prices can look like they are a bit on the high end for a place  like this (relative, they are not expensive), but then again when you have this rate of return customers, you can charge that little extra.. and you as a customer get it back in quality, and quantity. I didn't finish my full plate.

The chicken chimi.
A massive chimi. One! The size of 3 normal chimis. More than enough rice, more than enough beans covered with cheese. Yes, this seriously was not in my diet.. but I was hungry, and I got stuffed. I would definitely have this again. 

The waitresses is good and patient. No mistakes, and took our silly questions with a smile. No, I think I have found my go-to Mexican place for now. They deserve their reputation.. and they have been there forever, which means like 40 years or something.
