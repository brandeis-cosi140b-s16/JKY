This was an interesting dinner.  First, it was little bit of a pain in the ass to find, there isn't a big sign on top of the building, just small print on their glass door, but once we found it, it got even more fun, well, kind of.  The server was casual and down to earth, a little too casual.  He was pretty slow to bring out the drinks, and he told us, in his words, that he was "too busy" to read us the specials, so he dropped off his handwritten notes to our table and left for a while.  This was a little mind boggling since we were the only table in the dining area, and there were 2 people at the bar... But what I did appreciate from our server was his brutal honesty, my friend asked about the tamales, and he was really quick to say that it usually turns our dry, and that we shouldn't get it (she got it anyways and liked it).  

I got the Richardson Combo (eggs benedict, asparagus and 2 chicken enchiladas), weird combo right? But they blended together really well as I ate them.  I thought the food was great, they had a garlic infused hollandaise sauce on the eggs benny and the asparagus, and the enchiladas were quite tasty.  I had little bites of other dishes my friends had, and they were all really good, especially this one pork dish, I don't remember its name, but it was a slow braised pork, and it was amazing! 

This place lost a lot of points because the server made a douchy move.  After we ordered, he asked if we wanted to start with any chips and salsa, him just asking I assumed they charged for it, but I didn't see it on the menu, so there was the possibility they don't charge for it, but we said yes anyways, and he asked if we wanted guac too, and we said sure (again, nowhere on the menu).  Chips and salsa were $5.50 and the guac was $6, what the hell!?!?! $11.50 for that! UGH!! It wasn't even that good!    

To sum this up, amazing food (so amazing that it still gets a 4/5 after this terrible experience), not so great service.
