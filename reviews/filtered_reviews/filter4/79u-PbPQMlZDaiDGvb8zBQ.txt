We had just an hour-ish for a layover, so we stopped here for a quick dinner. Definitely very happy with our decision! Our waitress was pretty awesome. She was older and when she approached our table, she mentioned that they have $4 tequila shots. She didn't really offer the shots, as much as she told us about the shots in a way that we felt like it was a demand. Being challenged, and essentially called a wimp, we ordered the shots. My husband and I NEVER order shots when it is just us.. but hey, way to take our vacation to the next level, lady!
We also ordered a couple beers (heck yes to Golden Road brews!) and the Barrio Nachos. These nachos were really really good. Beef with sauteed mushrooms, garlic, onions, jalapenos, spinach, cream, chorizo and bleu cheese and "fresh Mexican farm cheese". They also came slightly "deconstructed" so it wasn't just a messy mash of flavors. The rest of the menu looked pretty interesting as well.. not your typical Mexican food and certainly not your typical airport food. The nachos were $15, but large and enough for 2 to have as a meal. Would definitely stop here again!
