I have been hearing about this place for over two years now from my coworker.  He had been bragging about it being the best authentic Mexican food here in Phoenix.  So finally today for lunch I decided I need to go try this place out.  I was very glad I finally went.  I had the lunch special of a stuffed poblano and shrimp enchilada.  While waiting on my food I was greated with chips and a yummy spicy salsa and a soup with veggies and beef.  Both were very good and I was then worrying that I wouldn't have room to finish my meal.  Before I could decide to put away the chips the food arrived.  I was surprised how fast they cooked my meal and once I tasted it I was amazed with the great flavor of the sauces.  The enchilada had a very good tasting green sauce and the chile was smothered in a spicy red sauce with onions.  The rice and beans on the side were good but after finishing the main course I had just a bite of each to see what they tasted like.  I will have to head back again for dinner as the menu was full of wonderful items I wanted to try.
