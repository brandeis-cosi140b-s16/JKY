Tried them based on Yelp reviews and got to say I was not disappointed. Very friendly atmosphere. Got to say probably the best Mexican food I have had in Las Vegas. Order taker was an older lady, extremely friendly and helpful. The lady in the back was pressing homemade tortillas. Had the Carne Asada burrito combo. The meat was tender and well seasoned, the rice & beans were good. The tortilla since being homemade was soft and flaky and not real doughy while taken an excellent char. Their fire roasted jalapenos and green onion were perfect. But the best....Their salsas. The pico de gallo style with the chips was hands down, excellent. They also have 3 "taco" sauces, of which 2 I liked a lot (the green and the darker red, the lighter red was good, just not a lot of flavor, but a lot of fire). Since I'm a midnight muncher, this location could have better hours, but it is family run, so its a good ---- scratch that, a great place for lunch or an early dinner. Think they close at 8 or 9 pm. My next venture here will be for next guilty pleasure...breakfast burritos, I hope they are as good as the carne burrito was. Definitely a go-to again. The area for some might seem a little seedy, but I have had no problems.
