'It's Mexican food captain, but *not* as we know it.  I was introduced to this place many years ago and I keep coming back because the food is good and I've never found another place quite like it.  The flavors are a little different than what I'm used to.  This is New Mexican food as in that state next door, not New as in nouveau or anything pretentious like that.  The speicals are usually decent but I'm a sucker for my old standbys.  The spooning rellenos plate and the Sante Fe which is a sort of mix and match  create our own which I always get with a chile relleno, a cheese enchilada and either a beef taco or a beef tamale.  Mmm!

They have two sorts of sauces that get draped over stuff, red and green.  Green is spicy. Red is hot.  If you don't like hot, don't say I didn't warn you.  I always order it on the side.  It feels a little bit prissy but that way I don't have to deal with too much sauce if I don't feel like it.  And hell, I'm the one who has to eat it and pay for it, so I want it how I want it.

I'm surprised at the reviews for bad service as I've always had good service there.  I must just be so charming that people go out of their way to be nice to me.  Yeah that's it! So if you go, remember to be charming, and bring your Visa card.. because they .. oh wait, they do? Nevermind.
