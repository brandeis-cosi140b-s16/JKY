I had a shredded chicken burrito, pinto beans, rice.. Smothered with green sauce & cheese. Lettuce & pico on the side. Paid way too much extra for the drop of sour cream and guacamole. 
Customer service sucks pretty much. If your new to the restaurant like I was, not a great first experience.
HOWEVER the food was great which is why I gave 4 stars
