This is a GO TO if you're looking for a happy hour spot to get down on some quality, super tasty grub and wash it down with some actual affordable brews! There are a grip of beers for $3 and even more options at $4. We had five or six different appetizers that were offered on the HH menu and were not let down by a single one. The ambient mood that is there is so nice and easing. You really feel like you can relax there. The music is the perfect volume and they play some really nice tranquil tunes. The decorations are very nice and the lighting is nice and dim too. Not too low like a drug den but just low enough so you can see everyone and everything but don't feel like you're in a cafeteria or operating room.
