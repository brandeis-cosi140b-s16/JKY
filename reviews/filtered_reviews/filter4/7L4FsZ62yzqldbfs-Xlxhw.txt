This is my new go to for my taco fix.. The queso dip is the best and the guacamole has bacon as a option , absolutely incredible ! Rice needed a little help though, over all we had amazing service and great interaction with management..  Can't forget to mention a gigantic variety of tequila choices. Very unique and comfortable atmosphere, fun place, check it out!
