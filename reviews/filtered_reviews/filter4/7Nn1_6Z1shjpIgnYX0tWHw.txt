I've eaten here about 10 times and I get the same thing every single time.  So take this review for what it is.... limited in scope.  The Margarita's are fantastic. I enjoy them.  The chips and salsa are good, and of course the salsa is HOT. The dish I love is the chicken enchiladas with a cooked egg on top. Not as good as Mi Nidito in Tucson, but still pretty darn good and worth the trip.
