I literally come here every time I go to Vegas. It is an easy to get to location with an entrance form the Strip and from in side the Monte Carlo and has great Mexican food. 

Guacamole, chips and salsa are always flavorful. Margaritas, while pricey, have a kick to them. For a cheaper option, order a pitcher and share. A pitcher has 4 pint sized fillings and is cheaper than ordering 4 margaritas. 

I have had burritos, tacos and quesadillas here. They all are fresh and well made. While this isn't "authentic" it is enjoyable. I will continue to keep coming back for my Mexican Food fix while in Vegas.
