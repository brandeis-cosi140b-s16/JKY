People do not usually come to the Palms Hotel for Mexican food .
There are the upscale lounges, the Playboy Club and the ever popular pool and pool parties. 
Soooo ... Gardunos - on most any night would be a three star Mexican restaurant.
On Sunday ...... the Margarita Brunch for $16.95 transforms it into somplace magical.
My sister and I came to the Sunday Brunch, and she was sure they would not put much alcohol in their margaritas ....
after all it was Sunday and it is all you can drink
( repeat .... all you can drink )
so I did my best to test her theory wrong ,,, and I was extremely successful.
They provide a nice "house" margarita with your meal. 
With an adequate amount of tequila.
The food selection was very good as well
A fine variety of choices are available, but  I basically stayed with Fajitas and Carnitas.
The Fajitas were super tasty and they served Carnitas in a spicy red sauce, and they were just supurb. 
The service was excellent ..... 
Waiters were very attentive and filled your glasses with your drink selection on a frequent basis.

My thought is -  where in Las Vegas, can you get good food, get blasted and enjoy every bit of it for sixteen bucks ...

I wonder what the  people in the Ghost bar paid for the same amount of tequila about 9 hours earlier.  

Sunday Margarita Brunch is amazing .....
