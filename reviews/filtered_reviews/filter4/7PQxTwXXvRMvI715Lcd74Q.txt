AMAZING tacos, pretty good other things.

My friend is a huge fan of the chef who created this restaurant so we came here at her request. 

I ordered three tacos:

Viva China (beef tendon and oysters) $5.50: Delicious! A very strange combination especially when on a taco, but hot damn was it good (yeah, I just said hot damn).

Lengua (beef tongue) $4: REALLY delicious! Easily the best flavored beef tongue I've ever had. 

Carnitas (pork, green sauce, and pork rinds) $4.50: I was a bit thrown off by the pork rind, but it really worked! Its a hard call, but this was probably my favorite taco.

The three were pretty darn small, but hey they were bomb.

The traditional Sui Mai (mini dumplings) were really good. But everything else I tasted food-wise was just ok. 

The drinks however were all delicious. Great selection and bar tending.

The service was also great. So this place isn't cheap, but if you want some different/awesome tacos, you may have found your spot!
