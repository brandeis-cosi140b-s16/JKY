The hubs and I ate here for lunch on Friday and was pleasantly surprised. It's a sister property to John Cutter, which we don't think of as impressive since the service always sucks. That's another review though. 

We started off with one of their signature cocktails, I had the cranberry fizz and he had the bloody Caesar. Although the drinks were pricey, they weren't watered down or tiny. The first thing that came out was their bread, and honestly it was the best bread I had at a restaurant in a long time: super rustic and crusty, served with some sort of aoili. The Manchego cheese plate was really good too. Stuffed Piquillo peppers, just ok. Garlic shrimp: well cooked, but I expected a little more flavor and punch. Meatballs: succulent and flavorful. I was slightly put off by the continuous use of red sauce, though. 

I love the decor of this place and it certainly helps that it's a short walking distance to our house. I really hope that it does well so the neighborhood has more options besides John Cutter.
