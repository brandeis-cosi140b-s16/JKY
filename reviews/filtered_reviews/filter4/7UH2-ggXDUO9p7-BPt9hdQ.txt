Went here with my girlfriend and the staff was very friendly.  She got the chalupas and I got the fajitas. Both dishes tasted amazing!  I could tell that everything was made in house and the cooks took pride in their food.  The atmosphere was hectic but  that's to be expected because it has very limited seating and most of the patrons do carry out.   One of the girls working said they were opening a dine in location at some point.  Sooner is better as I can't wait to sit down to a good meal from here. 
-one star off for limited parking and very limited seating.
