I have been to different Arriba locations and the food has always been consistent and I have always had very good service here.  I LOVE the White Sands Chimichanga, all rice,  no beans!  I have never been to a restaurant that provides beans like the ones you can get at home (you spoiled me mom!).  

The Chicken Chimayo is pretty good too.   The chips were good.  I prefer the smoother chili/salsa because it is spicier than the slightly chuncky salsa they serve.  I don't really care for the bean dip but the rest of my family enjoys it.

My only complaint is that I have ordered a side of the sauce that they put over the chimichanga to put on my rice (like a cup for ketchup when you order french fries) and they charged me about $3 for it.  It was a pretty small serving for that price.

I usually try to avoid "chain" mexican restaurant, but Arriba is really good.
