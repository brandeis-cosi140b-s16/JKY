I've been here on several occasions, most recently for Cinco de Mayo. The service is always right on target and the food is consistently flavorful. It gets busy here often, so be prepared to wait in the evenings. My only complaint is that the tap water was awful today. That might be a ploy to get you to buy a drink. It worked on me. You can't go wrong with any meal here.
