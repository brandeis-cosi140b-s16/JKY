Cafe Rio is everywhere in the valley.  Place is known for their Pork Barbacoa, but I don't prefer pork so I couldn't start my review on how great that was.  

What I can comment on..
-Nachos:  Missing San Diego, I had them create nachos with just sour cream, double chicken, and cheese.  I have to say, one of the best 2000 calories i consumed in one time in a along time.

-Burritos:  Kept it simple again.  Just the chicken and rice.  I'm not really into the messy wet burritio so I had them just add a small amount.  

Portions are huge and the meals are delicious.  Service is a quick cafeteria/assembly line type ordering. I like it.  At least you can see exactly how your food is being prepared. 

TIP:  Get your side sauces before you pay or while you are ordering.  They never ask if you need any and there isn't any in the condiment area or tables.
