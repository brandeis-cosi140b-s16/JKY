Valle Luna is a place I've driven past for months but never made it in.  A coworker suggested it for lunch the other day so I finally got to check it out.  The service was good, the chips and salsa were plentiful.  The lunch menu was limited, as well as a little pricey, but the portions were pretty comparable to the price.
