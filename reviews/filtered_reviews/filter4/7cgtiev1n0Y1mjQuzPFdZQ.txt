Our group was there on Thursday...about 10 of us.  We shared a variety of all of the appetizer specials ... everything was delicious. They should probably have warned us about the habanero sauce that came with one of the dishes (sorry, can't remember which one)... but after the initial burn, it was really good.  (If you like really hot & spicy, the habanero burger is awesome!).  Our waitress was excellent!  While we weren't a very demanding group, our server was on-the-ball and very professional.  

The decor is very unique, as well...in keeping with the "tavern' theme - there are bat-like designs everywhere.  If you visit during the cooler months, sit outside on the patio near the water or be sure to come at night and hang out next to the fireplace.  Fair warning, parking can be a bit of a bear as it is very limited. 

Overall, it's a nice place and good food.
