Was pleased with Backyard Taco! I went here to meet someone for lunch today, and it was a bit of a drive for me, but I'd say it was worth it. 
This is a cute little taco shop, a good amount of outdoor seating, and it wasn't too busy when we went. I checked in on yelp for free chips and salsa and was excited when I saw the salsa bar! There was only one vegetarian option, the crazy potato, so I ordered that. This was not like a typical meal that is order, but it was very good! Id get it again! The guacamole was a little odd, it was like liquified. But not bad! Chips and salsa were pretty good.
Backyard taco was also very clean when we went and our food was given to us in a timely matter! The food was super inexpensive too which was great. Overall, I was impressed with my experience here and would return if I happened to be back in the area.
