Ok peeps i'm not gonna lie, this place is pretty good.

Little bit of a shady neighborhood. We went at night, though, and had no problems.

Had carne asada sope and carne asada taco. I agree with my fellow Yelpers, the carne asada is pretty flavorful. Not crazy about the rice and watery guacamole but the beef was 2-thumps up
