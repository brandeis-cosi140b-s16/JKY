I absolutely love their fish tacos. In fact, I can't order them anywhere else now or I will be disappointed! The only drawback to this restaurant is that I have a small child and they have no changing table in the bathroom. I pointed this out to the owner and he said that they were going to get one, but as of now they still don't have one. This makes this a very unattractive choice for a place to eat in the summertime, as if I have to change a diaper, it's either do it in the restaurant or do it in a hot car. Both options are bad.
