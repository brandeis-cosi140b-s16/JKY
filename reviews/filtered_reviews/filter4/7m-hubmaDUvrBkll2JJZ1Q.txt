We got the pastor burrito and 3 tacos - pastor, asada and carnita.  

The food definitely tastes more authentic.  They also give you sliced radish, cucumber, lemons, and pickled carrots to accompany your meal.  The sauces they have are delicious as well - I liked the darker one in the squeeze bottle but needed the stuff they gave us in a bowl for heat.  

I'm not positive that it was asada, but one of the tacos was particularly amazing.  Definitely the best carne asada I've ever had (if that's what it is).  The flavor is complex without being salty.  Its awesome.

Definitely a must try!
