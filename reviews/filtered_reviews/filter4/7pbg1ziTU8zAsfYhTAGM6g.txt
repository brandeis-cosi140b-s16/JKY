we had a restaurant coupon and gave this place a try. i thought it was just a hotel eatery but it was pretty darn good. our server was attentive and kept our glasses full. i started off with a happy hour margarita that was heavy on the tequila (yay!) and salt (whew) but the latter is easy to fix. 

for dinner, i had the shrimp fajitas which where extremely tasty and filling and my gal had the ahi tuna which was a bit dry. the "free" chips and salsa had to be taken away as we kept munching and stuffing ourselves. my only gripe is the standard rice and beans accomp. for the price of the entree's, i would've thought the run-of-the mill rice and beans served at the el cheapo establishments would've been replaced with a more authentic or flavorful touch. 

well, whatever. we left happy and i accidentally left my doggy bag on the table and around lunch time today, wish i hadn't. it's a good place. very hot bartenders this night too....no worries as my gal lets me know when her male bartenders are just as smokin.
