I was meeting my date in the North Lake area, and my friend recommended Azteca in the past, so we decided to check it out!

I got there before he did, so I grabbed a table and ordered a Dos Equis Amber, my favorite, and it was on special!  They brought me chips and salsa to munch on, which were good.  I asked if they had anything spicier- and my server, who was very attentive, sent over one sauce- checked in with me, then sent an even spicier salsa once he realized I could handle it.  I'm all about hot sauces and salsas, and they were both great!  The hotter of the two was pretty crazy I have to admit.

Anyways, my date arrived and we ordered a little later.  He ordered a burrito, which he enjoyed.  I got the mixed fajitas- my usual at a mexican restaurant- and they were decent.  Portion was good for the price- I believe it was around $12.  The shrimp were kinda small, compared to my favorite spot, Three Amigos, in Plaza Midwood.

It's a big restaurant!  If you have a big group, it would be perfect!  Very attentive service, and I loved the tortilla treat at the end.  Who doesn't like honey and whipped cream?!?  Yum.  I'll hit it up again if I'm in the area!
