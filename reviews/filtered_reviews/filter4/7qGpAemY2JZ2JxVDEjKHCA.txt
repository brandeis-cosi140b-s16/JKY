Such nice people and glad to support Small Biz Saturday! Finally got a chance to eat here after passing by everyday to and from work. The BOGO and Amex deal really got me in the door. I got a bowl and even though im not a fan of seaweed it was pretty good. The avocados in the guacamole can use a little extra mashing but thats my only gripe.  The meat was tender,  toppings were fresh and the food was quick! Love it!
