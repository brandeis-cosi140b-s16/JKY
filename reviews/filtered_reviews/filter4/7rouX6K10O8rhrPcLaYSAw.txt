This place is so fun! I live in the east valley and my friend lives on the west side, so we love to find places to meet in Phoenix. This was the perfect spot. I tend to ask a million questions and the staff was more than happy to explain  anything and everything to me! I also love that they have red cream soda. It might look exactly like Chipotle but the flavor and quality is way better! Perfect Saturday afternoon lunch place.
