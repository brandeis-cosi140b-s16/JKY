New Mexican food?  Yes please!  Incredible food with incredible prices and an absolutely beautiful restaurant (think Pirates of the Caribbean ride and Casa Bonita from South Park).  I'm definitely coming back.  Oh...come hungry...the portions are more than generous.  

PS: try the chips and salsa.  It's not your average Picante salsa.  It was made with love, man.
