Only a Mexican food snob would undrmine such a great Traditional restaurant (and believe me we have plenty of those here in Arizona). This is old school Mexican food folks and it's about as good as it gets. The atmosphere is classic and I personally enjoyed it but it is not upscale  but then again Mexican food normally isn't. It's simple and that's what Arriba's is. If Arriba's were located in any Eastern state it would easily be the best in the entire state. The beans were great the salsa was delicious and the service was fast.
