Fat Boy is AWESOME!  Yep, that about sums it up in a nutshell!  Haven't been there yet?  Well, pack you bags and take a trip to the East side of Vegas for some tasty grub.  Here's why I am a big fan of Fat Boy:

1. The vastness of the menu! This joint has something for everyone.  They have burgers, pizza, chicken, and Mexican food all on their menu.  If you an't find something you like on the menu, you are definitely missing out!

2. The burgers (boygers) are yum-tastic! I  They are all super tasty and some of the best I have had in town.  They are also a great deal for the price point.  $3-5 for a freshly made burger is a-ok in my book!

3. The fries are great!  They have the thick, steakhouse stye fries.  A regular order comes with a fun season salt mix on them that tastes great.  You can also try their chencho fries that are covered in a green chili sauce and cheese.  They are a fun dish to chow down on for sure.

4. The prices are fantastic.  Your money definitely goes a long way here.  You can get a yummy lunch and be full all day for under $10 out the door.  They also have family deals like 4 burgers, 4 fries, and a 2 liter of soda for $18.  Not to shabby.  I always love great food for cheap.

Bottom line, I really enjoy Fat Boy and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a tasty lunch.  If you are on that side of town, go check them out to make your belly happy!

FYI, it is in a small strip mall and you may drive right past it.  You have to be on the look out for it.  It's on the NE corner of Stewart and Lamb.
