I have lived in the Valley of the Sun for nearly 13 years and I just found out about The Original Garcia's.    Serious props to a friend for mentioning it because this place is great.  The BF and I have been lacking a good regular Mexican joint (as opposed to the gourmet spin of Barrio Café) and The Original Garcia's will definitely be in our rotation going forward.  This place offers good food at a good value, which is just the thing during a recession.  The décor is fun without getting into the whole chain restaurant kitsch and this place is HUGE.  It's great for large groups.  

The Appetizer Combination is a must.  The miniature items are tasty and oh so cute!  The chimichangas rock.  Oh to luxuriate in that crazy good sauce they use to enrobe the chimis!  The combo beef and chicken fajitas were tasty, too.  The fresh limes were a nice touch and the guacamole was tasty with a refreshingly ample portion.  We'll be back!

Some reviewers talk about his place being in the 'hood.  The neighborhood is marginal, but it's not like you have to dodge stray bullets in the parking lot.
