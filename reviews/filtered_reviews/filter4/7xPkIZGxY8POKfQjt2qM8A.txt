Tostados asada was good..didn't get the lengua since it was my first time didn't know how to order. It's super crunchy, some burnt edges, but still good. I wished they gave more sauce or have bottles readily available for people. I wasn't aware until I saw folks asking for it. I didn't want to stand in line again for sauce. I'm sure you can go up and ask for them.

The asada tacos were not bad, just dry and really in need of sauce. The bbq pork was not my favorite. It comes in two corn tortillas because of the wetness and grease. 

I'd like to try the chorizo or quesidilla  next time as it looked good. 

There's limes and radishes (whole and sliced) for you to choose from. 

5 tacos and tostados were $12 not bad...would come back. I want to try the lengua but wished the line was shorter...
