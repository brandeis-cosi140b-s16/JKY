I'd like to know the "other" Mexican food places that are so much better. Los Sombreros is awesome! The drinks are poured with a heavy hand, which almost justifies paying $9 a cocktail, but that's to be expected at a lot of places. The salsa, first off, is to die for! The hotter of the two has a very strong chipotle flavor, which I love, but for those who don't the other one was just as good. The weird little pinwheel wheat things they give you with the chips are not my cup of tea, but just about everything else is. I think the spot is totally quaint and charming, and the servers are always accommodating. I'm vegan and started disecting the menu when the waitress asked if I was vegan, and I am, she suggested I get the chef's special vegan dish- rarely does that happen! It was amazing, the sauce was incredible, the potatoes mushrooms and corn were cooked to perfection and I appreciated the extra veggies and avocado. My boyfriend loved his, which was a fish dish, and everytime I go everyone loves it! Try it out.
