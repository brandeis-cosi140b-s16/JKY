I went here for a Friday lunch and really enjoyed it. I read that it had been featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives so of course, I wanted to go!
The interior is cute. Set up where you can sit and enjoy your lunch but after work you can post up at the bar and sip on something yummy. I wish I had the chance to try one of their margs but alas, I had work to get done at my job.
I got the AZ Style burrito meal and also a chicken taco. The chicken taco was free because I checked in on Foursquare. Love Foursquare deals.
The tortilla was amazing, super soft and chewy and not hard/stale or thin/transparent. The potatoes were thick cube cut and the pollo was seasoned with something not too spicy. I should have asked for it without onions, they were tiny but I'm not a fan in general.
They have an array of salsas to choose from, but the bottles weren't labeled so I was a little hesitant on what I was getting myself into so I stayed clear. 
It is certainly a hole in the wall but the food is just fabulous!
