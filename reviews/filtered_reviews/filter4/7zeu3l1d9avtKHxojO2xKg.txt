"Dick's Hideaway" would make a great porn title. Heh.

I was passing through town on a little roadtrip from LA and stopped here for a late lunch / early dinner. It just happened to be happy hour at the bar, and all small plates listed on the chalkboard were $5. Score! And the food was reeeally good. Double score!

Do you find it annoying when people write reviews but don't tell you what they actually ate? I do. But I'm about to be one of those people. Doh! I can't remember everything we had, I just remember my friend and I being uber pleased. There were definitely some green chile sliders, some garlic shrimp, a couple tacos, a tasty flatbread pizza thing, a couple beers. I think? Seriously, whatever we had left us wanting more! Only complaint is that service was a bit on the slow side.
