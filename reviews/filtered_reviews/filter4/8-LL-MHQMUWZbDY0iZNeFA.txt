Food was authentic as it gets, served fast and hot!  Loved the "real" Coca Cola made with sugar in glass bottles from Tijuana!  Recommend the "three tacos plate" for around $7:  your choice of about 7-8 different kinds of meat, including beef tongue (you don't have to choose the tongue!)  Yummy, inexpensive meal.
