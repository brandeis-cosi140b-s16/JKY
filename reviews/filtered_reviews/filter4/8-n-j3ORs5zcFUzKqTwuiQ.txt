Blanco was very good. It was hoppin on a Friday night, unlike many of the other restaurants in Scottsdale/Phoenix in this economy. The menu is a bit limited, but they do great with the Mexican style dishes (like tacos and cheesy dips) that they do offer. Our service at the bar was fantastic and the Margaritas were delicious :)
