First visit and I really like this place. They made my meal to order. I just said I want a plate with rice beans and meat and they had no problem with that even though they are a burrito taco joint. The red salsa is very good. My meal was fresh and delicious. The service was good. If you are in the area you should stop at the Burrito House. Come eat here.
