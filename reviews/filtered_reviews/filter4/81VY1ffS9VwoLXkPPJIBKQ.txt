I went to Yolos during my recent stay at PH for dinner on a Saturday night.  At around 7, the bar was pretty full but there were plenty of tables available.

I ordered the tortilla soup to start and was forewarned that it was spicy.  The small was a nice sized portion with big chunks of chicken.  It was very spicy and needless to say cleaned out my sinuses (but still, very good).  

For dinner I had the tostada salad with grilled chicken.  The salad was pretty big with roasted corn, black beans and avocados.  The servers were very friendly and the food came out really quickly. I wouldn't mind coming back and trying their margaritas and nachos!
