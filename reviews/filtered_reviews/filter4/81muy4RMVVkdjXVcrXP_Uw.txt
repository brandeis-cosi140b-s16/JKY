If you are in the mood for classic Mexican, this isn't the place for you.  I went in hoping for a yummy enchilada and a few strong margaritas.  

I came out with a taste of delicious fresh tex-mex, well made drinks, and a GREAT dining experience.

Granted, I went to Tortilla factory early in the evening before they were busy.  The waiter spent ten minutes chatting with us, educating us on the menu, drinks, and cuisine.  His recommendations and interactions are what made the experience above and beyond.

My recommendation is to jump right into the traditional "entree" cuisine, even if you are in more of a greasy enchilada sort of mood.  Ask the waiter for his or her recommendations,  (I loved the pork), and even if it's hot, sit outside.  The ambience is well worth it.
