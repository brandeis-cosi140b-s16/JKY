Extremely nice people who operate this business, particularly "Dan" who runs the front of the restaurant.

Due to a slight difficulty one day, Dan offered me a free water (due to the heat) and 50% off my next burrito.

This is great customer service.  I didn't even ask or expect this level of compensation.  It simply appeared to be a natural or automatic response to a small customer inconvenience.

The interior is clean and simple, with ample room for dining.

I have been here a few times now and can safely say that I am a fan.

Their "special" carne asada burrito is nicely flavored and has a multitude of little, succulent pieces of properly prepared steak.

I also enjoyed the breakfast burrito, which consists of eggs, potatoes, cheese, and choice of meat.

While not the best I have ever had, they certainly keep me returning for more.

Overall, PHX Burrito House should be applauded for having outstanding customer service and their ability to make a damn good burrito.
