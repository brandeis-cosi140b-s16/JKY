Late night eats for cheap. Tacos, tacos and more tacos really help soak up all that drinking you've probably been having. The carne asada fries are delicious and I'm not sure why this hasn't caught on here in NY.

You just get so much bang for buck and after spending for all that booze and gambling, this is a much welcome reprieve from it all. It's a dessert oasis here, offering sustenance and a break from walking all over.
