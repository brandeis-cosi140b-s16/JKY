On a quest for a good margarita Loco Lime was recommended as the go to place. I hate Central Ave it's so confusing but Loco Lime wasn't hard to find  - I wasn't feeling the parking lot a little small and gravel.. seriously lol if you have on heels be careful bc hells/wedges and gravel is a no go !

It was a nice day and they have patio seating but we decided to eat inside at a tall table near the bar.  Our waiter brought the chips and salsa appetizer out and we put in our drink order. They had a ton of specials going on so I just ordered what the waiter recommended for my margarita and started on the chips and salsa. Apparently they put cayenne pepper on the chips (yikes) .. I was not a fan of this but my sister loved it. I guess it depends on your tolerance for spicy food but they chips were a bit too spicy for me. I ended up ordering the shrimp quesadilla which was pretty tasty. Overall I like this place I would like to go back and try the tacos on Taco Tuesdays not sure what the special or deal is but I'm assuming they are pretty cheap.
