Ate here on the weekend with a party of ten. Was kind of nervous because no where else would take us as walk ins. We waited a few minutes at bar while tables were being set up. We ate outside on the patio. The water show at the Bellagio was going on through out our dining experience so that was pretty amazing! The Margaritas were pretty good. We love rock and roll music so had a great time of enjoying the moment. The service was pretty good, could have been a little better, but realistically, on a Saturday night in Vegas when the house seems to be rocking, we have eaten at much worse places! One thing we liked is that our waiter asked if it was our first time dining here. Because we said yes, he went over menu and we listened to his recommendations. The guacamole and Sampler were awesome. 
When we left, the managers and hostesses said good bye(that is rare these days!).
We will be back next month, or next big boys night out!!!!!
