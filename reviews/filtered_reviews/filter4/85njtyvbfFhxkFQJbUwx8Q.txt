I like the food here, sometimes the service lags a bit.  The parking is rough.  The menu is very extensive and make a choice quite difficult.  The locations is far, but worth it.  I love the avocado shrimp salad, very fresh.  They prepare guacamole at your table and it's good.  There is a lot to explore on this menu.  As mentioned before the chips and tortillas are fresh.  I'm looking forward to trying their cactus appetizer.

When you are leaving don't forget to get a mint, yum.  I pondered over what they were and finally asked.  Key lime after dinner mints.
