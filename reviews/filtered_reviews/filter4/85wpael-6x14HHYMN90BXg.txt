Besides the little street taco cart that is parked in a lot on 28th st and Mcdowell that I go to for my carne asada tacos...this comes in 2nd place:)  I am really picky about carne asada...many places make them either too dry or not flavorful enough...well not my little street taco cart,,,,and not my America's Taco shop!!!
I order two things here..Tacos and Quesadilla....
I normally do not eat quesadilla, but here its something else...
Cheese, moist and perfectly seasoned asada, with grilled sauteed onions all between a light crisp homemade tortilla?!?  What else can be better??  Well, maybe there are other things:)  But for this moment, during my 15 sec of fame...I mean review....Lets amuse ourselves:)  Go...you will not be disappointed
