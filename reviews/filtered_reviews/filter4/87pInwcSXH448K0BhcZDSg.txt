I really like the ambiance of Vida.  Located in the heart of the Epicenter, Vida is perfect for dinner before Bobcats games or events at Time Warner Arena, or before going to the clubs, bars and lounges that populate the upper reaches of the Epicenter.  

I had the pleasure of dining at Vida for brunch on Cinco de Mayo, and was treated to a Cinco de Mayo to remember.

Ordered the steak and eggs which was amazing.  The steak was juicy, tender and had a great grilled flavor to it.  I will say, I asked for my eggs scrambled w/cheese and received no cheese.  But other than that, everything was spectacular.  The fruit cocktail containing strawberries, watermelons, and a variety of other fruits was great and the perfect complement to the meaty steak, eggs and bacon.  

I also had the chance to sample their margaritas and was truly impressed.  And of course, the Dos Equis Amber on draft might be the single greatest beer drinking experience known to mankind.  

Be careful, parking can be expensive in the garages near and around the Epicenter and Vida doesn't validate parking (I know because I asked).  Overall, I must say, brunch at Vida for Cinco De Mayo was nothing short of Cinco De Amazing!
