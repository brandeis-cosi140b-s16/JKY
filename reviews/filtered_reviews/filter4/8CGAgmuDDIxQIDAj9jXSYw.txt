Come hungry!  They give huge portions, not that I mind, it's just a lot of food.  I got a salad which was delicious, I like that it's build your own style.  I really want to try the tacos next time.

The coconut bark is the most amazing thing in the fricken world I want to go back and buy a pound of it.  It's the perfect combination of sweet, salty, and crunch.  YUM!
