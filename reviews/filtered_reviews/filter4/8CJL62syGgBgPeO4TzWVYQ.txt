I cannot put into words how delicious Gallo Blanco's tacos are! Although the service is never the best, the food makes the experience a great one. The ahi tuna tacos are to die for. I bring all of my friends there and they all seem to agree. I have also had their breakfast which is very good. I recommend this place to anyone looking for flavor and atmosphere.
