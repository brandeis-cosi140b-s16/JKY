I'm glad I did my Yelp research on this place. 
I wasn't expecting much for a Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix area because I usually have high expectations after reading Yelp reviews. This place came through! I had the street tacos which the variety of meats (free samples of each given at the counter) were each unique and full of excellent flavor. It was difficult to narrow the selection down to just 5 choices with like 10 to choose from. 
The decor at the location was pretty cool. Not as fancy as the Lucha Libre place in San Diego but I'm sure they are run by different owners. Same style and same pride in the food they serve. 
Good job Santos Lucha Libre!
