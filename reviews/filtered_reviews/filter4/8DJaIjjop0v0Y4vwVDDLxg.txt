Came back due to an invitation from management. Decided to order the exact same thing as last time. It was significantly better this go around. Mom said her chimichanga was better as well. They've reeled me back in and I will be back more often. This is great news because I love the atmosphere and intimate setting. 

I have to say that I still miss Super Mex (Sorry management. This is not your fault.). But I am getting over the fact that they're gone and Jalisco is now here instead. But, I can say that I took my Mom to Lindo Michoacan today for Father's Day and we both agreed that the food there still wasn't as good as it is here as Jalisco Cantina. Oh and the manager here insisted that the grilled veggie burrito wasn't on the Super Mex menu, but I beg to differ. It was, I ordered it often and it was amazing every time that I did.
