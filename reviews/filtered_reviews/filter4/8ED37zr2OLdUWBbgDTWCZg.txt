Upon moving to AZ, we tried Z'Tejas and I was not a fan.  I can't say why exactly - the food just didn't do much for me.  

I gave it another shot recently and I'm a convert!  My smoked chicken quesadilla was delish and they have a great drink menu (I had a watermelon concoction with black sea salt).  Staff was great!
