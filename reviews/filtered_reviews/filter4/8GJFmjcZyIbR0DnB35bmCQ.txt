To be honest, I was really skeptical when my friends told me we were going to a Chinese-Mexican fusion restaurant. I like them mutually exclusively & never got on the fusion food bandwagon. I went in a party of 6, and we shared everything family style - that's the way to go! 

Sitting on the "patio" is a great place for people watching, as it's across the way from Marquee and the other restaurants in the Cosmopolitan. 

Some highlights from our meal:
- Twenty-Vegetable Fried Rice: absolutely delicious and strongly scented of sesame.
- Chilaquiles: the Menorita cheese was so melty, salty and perfect
- Shrimp Mojo: Light spice. I like the addition of the black garlic
- Kao Lao Lao: Little rolled noodle sheets served with a fermented vegetable sauce. Very rich, umami flavor
- I didn't personally get the duck tongue tacos, but those that did were blown away!

My only gripe was the price of alcohol. On a whim, we decided to order a pitcher of margarita & a few a la carte drinks - which pushed our $200 meal to well over $300. Oopsies, should have looked at the price beforehand. They were mediocre, so pre-party elsewhere.

Yes, there will be haters that say the prices are too high, but this is Vegas. It's food by Jose Andres, for heavens sake...
