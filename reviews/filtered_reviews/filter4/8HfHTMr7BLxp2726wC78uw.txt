I'm surprised this place has such a low rating. I thought it was pretty good!

The restaurant is pretty, and the staff is really nice. If the weather is nice, I would recommend sitting on the patio. It has a really nice view of the Mandalay Bay Pool, and it's well shaded with fans.

The restaurant starts you off with a nice salsa trio, each of which has a nice, distinct flavor. The carne asada quesadillas are really good - the beef has a great flavor, and are nicely crisped without being greasy. The guacamole is simple but fresh and tasty. The pepper crusted steak salad is really good. The steak is cooked really well, and the salad is a nice bed of fresh greens with avocados and blue cheese. So good!

I would definitely go back!
