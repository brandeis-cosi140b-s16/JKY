In Vegas from L.A. Reviewing food.(service was great ).
The tacos are really well executed:you can taste the ingredients and the housemade tortillas are supple and melt in your mouth with the filling.Not gonna list them all, but they were all excellent to our taste.
 The Huitlacoche "shaved pasta", needed salt .The pasta were nice though, with a great texture but the spiciness overwhelmed the dish.We still managed to finish the bowl.
Shrimp Mojo was tasty,the flavors well balanced, although we thought they would have been nice served with an accompaniment .
The must have to finish your meal: The sticky rice foam and mango.Their take on the classic Thai dessert (sticky rice and mango).When our waiter described it to us I was drewling! And It was beyond belief! I would go back just for that.
