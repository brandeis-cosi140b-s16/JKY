Prolly one of the better meals I had in Vegas in my most recent visit.

I have had really bad luck when eating in Vegas, so feel free to recommend any great places, hole in the wall, or anything above.

Yelp was good to me this time, quick search yielded Original Lindo Michoac√°n no too far from where were so we went for it.

Nice service, check
cool place, check
good food, check
good prices, check

As said before, one of the better meals I've had in Vegas
