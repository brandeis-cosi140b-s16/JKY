We love to get take out at Los Taquitos on a busy week night when we are too tired to cook. They are super fast and dinner for 4 is usually under $20! 

I love the street tacos and my husband the ceviche. Son loves the carne asada burrito, daughter the tamales. Seriously something for everyone. There IS some variability in the spicy factor, but we are total regulars. Gotta try it!
