I'm rounding up because I had a really good time.  The place is very nice, I like the patio, this is the same location were the coffee shop used to be.  We were a group of 17 women, so you can imagine our poor server was a little overwhelmed.  I had the steak skewers and those were amazing, the chimichurri sauce was great.  Very similar to the one I had in Argentina several years ago.  I was not in the mood for a margarita, but most of my friends had several, they look good and my friends said it was tasty.  I will definitely come back to try other items, and my steak skewers.
