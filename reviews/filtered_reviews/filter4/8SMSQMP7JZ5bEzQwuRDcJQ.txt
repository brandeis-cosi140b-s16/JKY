I used to love this place before they changed their menu.  They use to have this awesome chimichanga, which was filled with peppers, spicey pork and lots of other goodies.  I always got it with the white cheese sauce.  Let me tell you, this chimichanga was DA Bomb!!  However, for some reason, they took it off the menu!!  Ugh!! The food is still pretty good though, but I miss that chimichanga more than you know!  In fact, let's have a moment of silence, please!  :)
