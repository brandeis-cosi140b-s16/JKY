New Sanbar on Ray Rd (near I-10; just east near Red Lobster & Lowe's).  Grand Opening 9/17/09.  Dropped by last night and they let us in as part of the "Friends and Family" pre-grand opening.  Nice place, roomy, great place to watch games; never been to Sandbar in Scottdale or other locations, but this will be a fun spot to frequent - nothing else like it along Ray Rd.  They gutted the old Bahama Breeze and this place is much better!

Food was good; drinks were good; friendly staff - the sand, pool all make it fun.  Big bars; good indoor seating; lots of parking.  Coconut shrimp are really good as an appetizer.  Lots of great HDTV's for game watching...no bad seats for viewing anywhere.

Should be a hit!  Looking forward to going back with some friends.
