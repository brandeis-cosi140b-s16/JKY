We went to Hussong's for a late lunch before a college basketball game earlier this year. I was curious about it when a friend had mentioned they had been to the other location in Ensenada. This could easily be my favorite place in Vegas for Mexican food and margaritas! The chips and salsa could have been a meal alone, they were so yummy. The service was excellent, as were my fish and veggie tacos. It is definitely Baja style food but at Vegas prices, which didn't surprise me because it's located in the Mandalay Bay shops. I will definitely be back here!
