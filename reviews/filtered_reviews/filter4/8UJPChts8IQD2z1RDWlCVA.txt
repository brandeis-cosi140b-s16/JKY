Went at my brother's suggestion late on a Sunday morning just before heading back home after a trip to Vegas recently.

I wasn't impressed with the carne asada tacos.  The meat wasn't as grilled or seasoned as I like it, but it was fresh, so I'll give them that.  The avocado salsa was delicious.

They would have gotten 2 stars if not for the ... AL. PASTOR. TACOS.  Sweet baby Jesus.  They were incredible.  Crispy meat, perfectly seasoned. That alone brought the rating up to a solid 4 stars.

Not a fan of having to stand in different lines depending of the type of tacos you want, but now I know that next time I'm in Vegas, I won't have to bother with anything other than that al pastor line, so no biggie.
