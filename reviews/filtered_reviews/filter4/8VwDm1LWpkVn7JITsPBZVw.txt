Why all the bad reviews?? We actually ate here 3 times over the course of the weekend (umm... don't judge), and I liked everything I ordered. I mean, I guess I wouldn't have gone out of my way to come here if I weren't staying at the Hard Rock, but when you're hungover and need a big plate of nachos for lunch and there's Pink Taco right downstairs... well, there ya go. 

I tried the chicken tacos (good), tostada salad (really good), tortilla soup (decent) and chicken nachos (decent). I would like to drink an entire carafe of their green salsa. Is that weird? I don't care.
