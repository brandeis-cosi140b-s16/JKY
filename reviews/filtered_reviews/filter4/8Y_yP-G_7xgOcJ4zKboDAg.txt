Monday was quite a day of day drinking and eating.  Mr. M & I had already hit two other places and then we decided to head much closer to home and try Nando's.  I've been curious since they started remodeling the place, and driving by at night the white lights on the patio & inside looked very inviting.

This location is exactly that:  inviting and even though the building is large, there are smaller rooms inside and the brick interior makes it feel cozy.  The staff could not be more friendly.  I think I saw everyone smiling which is always appreciated.  We started with 2 of the Cabo margs with curacao which were large and delicious.  The chips and salsa were good too.  I used to think I liked my salsa more like pico de gallo, but now I'm gettin' into the salsas that are more of a puree.  Nando's salsa had a very nice blend of flavors.  They gave us the mild/medium one, and then a small container of salsa they said was very spicy.  We're both a couple of heat pansies and didn't try that one, but it smelled good.

Then Mr. M had the Pollo Rico and I had the #10 which was with 2 beef flautas, black beans, and rice.  Now I know this isn't really authentic but both dishes were flavorful and enjoyable.  Both meats, the chicken in the Rico and the beef in my flautas were very tender.  As others have mentioned the portions are HUGE.  We left with mucho leftovers which I'm always happy to warm up the morning after and throw a fried egg on top of.  And I froze all the Spanish rice and will use that in a tex mex soup that I make.

I mentioned in another review today that I've been having major cravings for Mexican food lately and this place fit the bill.  I would definitely go back mainly because the atmosphere is so inviting and because it's a good value for the money.  They also do flights of tequila.  I will most definitely be back to try some of those.  Glad to see a Mexican joint within walking distance.  Or shuffling distance.
