This place could easily end up being 5 stars once they work kinks out.  Newly opened and completely slammed, but still pulling it off.  Great job guys.  There were a couple little hiccups, but all were quickly noticed by staff, no need for me to mention them.

I don't frequent the northeast much, so I've never been to one of these before.  With the garage doors open and the breeze strolling through this wonderful new bar, I think I've found my new spot to hangout in Dilworth.  Westerns on the TV, Johnny Cash playing loudly, and a $28 pitcher of a very drinkable margarita.  I'm in.

I just went for some guac and tacos.  The guacamole came out chunky and delicious.  Both salsas put the chips and guac over the top.  Then the tacos, oh how I love tacos.  The mole was superb.  Not necessarily traditional,  in the mole recipe or with the pickled onion, but it just worked.  By far my favorite.  The cochinita ended up coming in second, as it had great flavor, but just wasn't quite a complex in flavors.  While I love braised short ribs, that taco needs something else as well.  Maybe more white onion, or thicker slices of radish.  All I tasted was short rib.  The crispy mahi wasn't that crispy, and also didn't seem super fresh.  Says the guy who bought fish on a Monday.  Bourdain wouldn't do it, why should I?

All in all, its a trendy taco spot and southwestern style saloon that actually pulls it off instead of being cheesy.  I'm not saying the tacos are the best in Charlotte, but they are up there.  Being able to get full for a reasonable amount of cash in that part of town isn't the easiest to come by.  There beers are a little high, but they have a PBR special.  I'll be back soon and hope to notch this up one star.
