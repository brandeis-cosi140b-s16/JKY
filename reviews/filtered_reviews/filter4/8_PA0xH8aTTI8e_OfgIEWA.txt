GREAT Place! My fiance and I stopped here for an early, low key dinner one night on our trip to Vegas last week.  We were just looking for a nice casual place out, after our long day at the pool, then to walk around comfortably on the strip after.  We ordered the bottomless nachos to begin and they were fresh (and I mean, the nachos themselves were hot, fresh and just made!), delicious and huge! With just the right amount of everything.  They were accompanied with 3 different salsas and we loved each one. We then ordered fajitas (1 steak entree and 1 chicken entree) and they too, were fresh, delicious and great sized portions. I didn't try any cocktails here, but my fiance was happy with the tap IPA beer the waiter recommended.  I found myself craving it again the next day while sitting at the pool, but knew I couldn't indulge in nachos again haha.  The service was a bit slower than expected, considering the place was actually pretty dead.  Had the hostess and service been a bit more attentive, I'd give it 5 stars, but overall the place was really great and we would definitely return!
