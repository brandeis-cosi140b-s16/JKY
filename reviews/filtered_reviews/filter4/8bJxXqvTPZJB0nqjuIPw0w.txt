Get in line for the tacos.  $2 tacos that are the best.. just get in a long line to order and plenty of fresh made salsa's and condiments.  Does not take long and the smells are oh so good, makes you mouth water.

Watch out some of the salsa's are hhhhooooooooooooooot!   

Several slections of the type of taco: carne asada, carnita, chorizo and a thin rib eye or get a combo.  

Taco stand is open on weekends and I think on Fridays in the summer but call to check out the hours if that is why you are going.

If your looking for good tacos or a mexican grocery, this is the place.
