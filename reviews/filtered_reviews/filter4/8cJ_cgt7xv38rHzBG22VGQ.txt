I had such a great dining experience at Diego Pops tonight 
Our server Cait was excellent 
She gave us a run-down of the menu and told us about the goodies
The entire menu was very intriguing and on this particular visit, I went with the Green Chili Chicken bowl... With the rice and "refried" beans option
For starters we had the chips and salsa and we also added on some guacamole... Omg they were soooo good... The salsa had a kick to it, which I love... And the guac was equally as tasty...
I had the sangria rojo and it complimented the meal very well... 
The bowl was pretty interesting when it arrived but once I started eating it, the favors were immense... 
I can't wait to go back to try the tacos and cocktails 
Such a good experience.. Will recommend to friends... 

Ps- parking is great at this location! Side and front lots available
