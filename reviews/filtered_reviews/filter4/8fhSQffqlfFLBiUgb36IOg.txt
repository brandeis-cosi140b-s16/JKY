I had the chicken enchilada and it had a ton of chicken in it.  It was very flavorful and seasoned just right.  The avocados were a creamy addition to it and the rice and refried beans were amazing.  On Friday they have $5 house margaritas and they are huge and very good.  The salsa they send with the chips while you eat is spot on.  It has the right amount of kick to it and the chips are also seasoned well.  This was my second time here and we will definitely be back for more!
