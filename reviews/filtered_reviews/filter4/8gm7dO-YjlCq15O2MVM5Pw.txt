Verde is simply delightful. Awesome margaritas, knowledgable friendly waitstaff, and the carne asade!!!! I'm paleo so sometimes eating in a mexican/mexi-cali environment can be challenging (because chips are great, ya know?) but I managed to order the guacamole and it was delightful. The Carne Asade was a recommendation from my waiter and I am glad I followed his rec as the meet with cooked just right, super tender, and exactly what I wanted to eat. I can't wait to go away, it was a really enjoyable meal!
