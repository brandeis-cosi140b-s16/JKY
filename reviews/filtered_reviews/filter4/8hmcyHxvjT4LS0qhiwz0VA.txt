House marg is a god send. DELISH and $4. I had a Paloma type drink as well which was top notch and the micheladas are refreshing and flavorful. Chips and salsa are fresh, crispy, and limited! Caveat emptor - if you are one to nosh on chips before you eat, slow your roll or pay extra. I had a crispy pork belly taco which was muy sabroso (yummy) and had so many great textures. MUST HAVE! My mom had the carne asada taco which was ok. The shrimp taco was probably my favorite. Street corn was A+++ and competes with Gallo Blanco (RIP) if you were a fan of their street taco. It can be loud in there. It is a concrete box. Whateva.
