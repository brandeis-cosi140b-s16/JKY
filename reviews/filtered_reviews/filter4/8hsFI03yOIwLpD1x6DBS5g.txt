My friend and I went to this quaint place along with other "WineBats" for an evening of "little Bites" and glasses of wine.  All of it very good!
We ordered Machaca Chicken Mushroom Taquitos...excellent with a little bite.  Panko Crusted Fried Calamari...succulent!  Imported Cinco Queso with olive oil fried bread and the best tortilla chips I have had in quite some time, and at the end  we ordered the Fried Ice Cream Quartet...that was amazing!  Service was on point!  We are going back to try their regular menu some time.
