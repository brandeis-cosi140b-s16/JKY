One day I was wondering what the big hooplah was over Cafe Rio. Personally, at the time, I was Team Chipotle all the way but my curiosity got to me. So I go in and order the salad.

I ordered the salad with salmon and the house dressing. When I got to my table with the mint limade, I almost couldn't bear to eat my salad because it looked so pretty with the green romaine lettuce (I requested bothchopped and shredded lettuce) pico de gallo, scoop of guacamole, crispy tortilla strips, cilantro and that white cheese they put on top. With the tomatillo cilantro house dressing, it was mighty tasty. And I love their fresh tortillas! That's one thing thats a huge difference from Chipotle. Portion sizes are huge too. I'm always way tlk full if I finish the whole portion they give me.

During their lunch rush, they are all about speed so don't expect a very warm welcome from their food line, which I can understand. They want to get people in and out asap to make their customers happy because, ultimately, that's all they want: their food. So A for effort there. When they are slower however, the staff is more welcoming. Usually the cashier is very nice. One time I called about missing dressing, told them about the the next time I went and they comped my meal. 

I love the selection of drinks and syrups they have to personalize to you tastes. The mint limeade is my favorite but they are all good. 

Bravo, Cafe Rio on Stephanie, bravo.
