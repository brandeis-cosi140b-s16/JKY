We finally gave this place a try for lunch on July 4th.  We had great service; greeted the minute we walked in the door, seated quickly, received water asap. Our server came out with chips and salsas, explaining the heat and spices of each. After looking at the menu he offered to answer any questions we might have. We weren't rushed or made to feel like it was an eat-and-go type of place. The sauces are spicy, but I say most folks know that New Mexico Mexican is not like your run of the mill Mexican food. They traditionally use more variations of chilies with different levels of heat. Don't fault the restaurant. When I try something new, I want something new. Our food was great. I tried the green corn tamale and pork enchilada, both with green sauce, black beans & rice. Thoroughly enjoyed it. My husband had the blue corn enchiladas from the specialties section of the menu. The pork was tender and flavorful. Not too hot but 'warm'. The portions are quite generous. My only issue was that my food was not nearly as (oven) hot as my husband's plate seemed to be. I believe my food was ready before his. Other than that it was a great lunch experience. The next time we go we'll ask to sit in the bar area at the tall tables. This is a family friendly restaurant. I wouldn't say they cater to kids, but you can feel comfortable dining there with young ones. Sometimes I just want to sit with the grown ups, so that's why I'll ask for the bar area.
