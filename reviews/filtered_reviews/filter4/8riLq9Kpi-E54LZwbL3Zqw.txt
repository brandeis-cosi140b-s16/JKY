First off I would like to say if you haven't been to downtown Gilbert in a while you need to. It has become a hip little restaurant row.  A few years ago I moved away from Arizona to foodie heaven a.k.a. Portland, OR. Being from Arizona originally I would have to say that the one thing Portland cannot seem to replicate correctly is Mexican food. So coming back to visit tacos are an essential must eat. 
A friend suggested we head over to Joyride Tacos and I'm sure glad she did. Every sip and bite was delicious! They had both a front and back patio with plenty of seating. Being a beautiful sunny, 70 degree day we choose to sit out front. While I was waiting for my guest, the waiter promptly brought out chips and salsa, then took my drink order. They have about 6 aqua frescas to choose from which you can get with or without alcohol. I choose the almond horchata, oh man was it good! They serve it with a little bit of ground cinnamon sugar and nuts on top and that gives it an amazing texture. The chips were crisp and tasted like they had been fried fresh that morning. The salsa was spicy yet fresh. So don't be afraid to dig in just because you can't handle heat. When my friend arrived we ordered a couple tacos each. I got both a chicken and shredded beef taco, both came with and assortment of cheese and veggies on top, including avocado. I ate my chicken taco first which was very tasty, but the beef taco was by far superb. You could literally taste the smokey goodness in every bite of the taco and the creamy avocado was a perfect accent to the meat. Oh and because the two of us ordered more then 3 tacos we received a free side dish! We choose the black beans and they were better then any black beans I have ever had before. Overall I will be heading back to Joyride Tacos at least once every trip back to AZ!
