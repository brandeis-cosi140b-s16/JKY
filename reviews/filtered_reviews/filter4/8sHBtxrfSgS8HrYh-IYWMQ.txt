This place really has a great Scottsdale/Southwest/Sexy vibe.  Walking in I am always impressed by the sexy southwestern decor.  Kinda dark with mirrors, candles and a glowing salt block wall that separates the kitchen from the dining area.

These guys have a great tequila and margarita selection.  It would be a mistake to head straight to the dining area without stopping in the bar first for a drink.

I've been here on Sundays for the "Pig Out" all you can eat pork event which is great.

This recent visit they were offering a five course fixed menu with wine pairings for $65/person.  I love these type events because the chef can experiment with new recipes and as a guest I get to try many new flavors and wines.

This meal progressed from scallops to roasted guinea hen to halibut to Berkshire pork to chocolate cake.  My favorite was the pork and least favorite course was the chocolate cake with the lime sorbet.

The wines were mostly from Spain with a Malbec and Champagne added to round out the pairings.

Get on their email list for upcoming events or just stop in for a meal.  This place is consistently good.
