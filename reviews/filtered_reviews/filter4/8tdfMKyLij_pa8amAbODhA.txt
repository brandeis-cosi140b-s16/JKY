Frijoles brings Mexican street food to is essentials and excels at it.  A simple menu prepared with care and fresh ingredients brings out the best.  The meat is cooked to order and the beans have the texture that exudes freshness. Good balance of flavored.  Highly recommend.

Update - I ordered the frijoles and beans last night.  Best beans I have ever had!  Sublime.
