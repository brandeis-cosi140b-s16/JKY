I love Miguel's. It's not fancy but the food is really good. You could miss this place easily if you weren't looking for it. But do look for it, you'll be glad you did. When you walk in, you feel like you're walking in to someone's home kitchen. There is a choice of indoor or outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is in a little open air structure, so you are still out of the elements if it's raining or if the sun is beating down in the summertime. The menu has a lot to offer, I usually get tacos and rice and beans, while my fella usually gets jalapeno poppers and a veggie quesadilla. There are also American choices on the menu. Portion sizes are generous. The police in the area seem to really like eating here, there is almost always an officer dining when we go there. That tells me 3 things, Miguel's treats our officers right, the food is really good and a good value, and I will be safe eating at this establishment. Service is always friendly. I wish Miguel's would come to Raleigh.
