Had been wanting to try this place out for a few months.  An old friend in town was the perfect excuse.  Located in beautiful Tivoli Village, parking was a breeze, though I imagine peak times on the weekend might take a bit longer. Indoor and outdoor seating is a great feature, with outdoor seating on both the side and in front. 
We chose a spot inside since it was 1pm and pretty hot out.  Our server was spot on with everything including letting us know about the grilled salmon special. Nice selection of beers including Carta Blanca, Tecate, Dos XX, Corona, etc...along with margaritas, and a decent wine selection.  
We ordered the queso laredo dip as an appetizer and it didn't dissapoint.  Most of the appetizers are for 2-4 people to share. The 2 salsas they bring along with the chips are excellent as well.  The main dishes are small compared to what most folks might be used to at a Mexican restaurant.  However, the food quality is great, fresh, tasty and suprisingly filling.  I ordered the Tacos Barbacoa, and would again, although there are so many great menu options to try.  My friend had a different Tacos plate and loved his as well.  We abstained from dessert and coffee, and they don't have espresso, just regular brewed coffee available.  Hopefully, they'll invest in an espresso machine and train the staff here soon.  Total lunch bill for 2 people with a shared appetizer and a couple beers was just over $40.00.  So my opinion is price for the quality is a good deal.  It's not a bargain, huge plates or a buffet style Mexican restaurant.  If that's what you might be looking for, this really isn't the place, and you probably won't feel you are getting your $ worth.  This was a weekday at lunch so dinner prices and larger crowds may affect the price and server dynamic. That being said, I would highly recommend this spot.
