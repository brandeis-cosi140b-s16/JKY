I love Havana grill!!! Although I always order the same things.... It's awesome. The fried plantines, and the cuban sandwhiches are my faves. The service is friendly everytime I go there, and the atmosphere is really nice. The only thing I wish was that the food was cheaper so I could go there more often!! =)
