Oh wow, what an unexpected find. I got tipped off to try this place by a couple of different people and so after wanting something besides Thai food for lunch I checked it out. The parking lot is packed and there was a LVMPD motorcycle officer parked out front. If the cops eat there, it's usually a good sign that the food doesn't suck. 

From the minute I walked in the door until I left, Service with SPEED! and Service with a smile was the rule. This wasn't a 45 min super slow lunch and I liked that. They have an extensive menu but the lunch specials are what I went with today and the pricing was not bad. Before I even got to order chips, salsa, and bean dip were on the table. The salsa at first shocked me. Not what I expected. I'm used to pico type salsas, this was a more complex, non jalapeno, we know our peppers and are not afraid to prove it salsa that with each bite I fell more in love with. My pollo dish was interesting with a tomato based sauce that just worked with some very flavorful chicken. The corn shells were not over cooked or greasy either.

Overall, I was impressed. But now that I'm away from there I'm turning up my inner critic, the one that thinks Due Forni sucks and am looking back at the experience. When my only complaint is parking because it's busy, yeah, it was a good experience. 

4 Stars - If I could go 4 1/2 Stars I would.
