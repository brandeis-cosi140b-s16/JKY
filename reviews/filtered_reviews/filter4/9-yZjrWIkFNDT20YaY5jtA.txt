I love this place - it was one of my early finds upon moving to Charlotte a few years ago, and I go back about once a month. 

I almost always get either the Mahi Mahi tacos or the Chicken serrano tacos -- in the tortilla on a bed of cabbage, with CBT's signature yogurt-based sauce, and some queso fresco...yum. My husband always gets the Cabo Fish Tacos, but I prefer my fish unfried. I got a burrito once - nothing to rave about - and the scallops once - tasty - but I'm kind of blown away by the reviews on here who give CBT a one or two-star rating and then confess "well, I don't like seafood/fish/the central concept" etc. Why would you go to a place with the word "fish" in the name? But anyway....

The corn salsa DOES always end up on the table. Just wipe it up. The real disappointment for me, taste-wise, is the sides. I've had the cucumber salad, the napolitos salad, and th baja rice...all not good at all. My husband always gets the Mexican coleslaw, but I stick to beans/rice (with corn)...definitely the tastiest, in my opinion.

And spending $8 for dinner - excellent. Add in a margarita (starting at $4 for the "El Cheapo") and you're all set.
