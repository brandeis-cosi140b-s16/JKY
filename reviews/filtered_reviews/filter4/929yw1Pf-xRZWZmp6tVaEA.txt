Great service always.  Excellent place to grub and for you night owls it's open till 6am every night.  Most people are happy with the burrito Colorado, but I prefer the seafood enchiladas.  But they have a large variety.  The prices are from $9 to $20 ish.  As usual this venue does not fit the yelp $$ scale. :)
