Say MexKo
When I was a kid I saw this commercial where someone carrying a piece of chocolate fell into someone holding peanut butter, and peanut butter cups were discovered! Now, that's fusion! I don't know who fell into who here but mixing  Korean and Mexican did not have the same effect as the peanut butter cups for me. And don't get me wrong the food wasn't bad but I would rather have either Korean or Mexican, but not mixed, which they also serve. I did like the chips the salsa and the guacamole they were very tasty, and I would stop here just for that.
Service was very good, very friendly and attentive. The place is small but kept clean. Oh! And the Korean lady taking my order and asking me how I wanted the food made, in Spanish! Now that's a bonus star! (Review went from three to four.)
 I will probably stop again  and try other items, Mexican or Korean but not mixed. For now, I'll just stick to my own Korean, Mexican fusion..... me and my Hyundai.
