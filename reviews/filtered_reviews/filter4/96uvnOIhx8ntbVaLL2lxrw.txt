This was my first time here, but won't be my last. We sat on the outside patio, which would have been fine if we were toddlers or little people, because the seating is so low! Not to mention there was an abundance of flys that were on attack to every single patron out there. I think the restaurant should invest in some citronella candles to keep those things away. It was a total buzz kill. Pun intended. If you do choose to dine outside, do your eyes a favor and bring your sunglasses! The sun umbrellas are no good at 6:30pm. 

As for the food... Yum-O! I ordered the guacamole with bacon and corn because I was intrigued. It did not disappoint. The frozen drink I had was infused with green tea and it totally hit the spot! Then we ordered the corn Mesa quesadilla and the Baja tacos which were both Amaze-Balls but overpriced for the quantity of food given. 

All in all, come hungry, plan on spending a little bit more, and please sit inside!
