This definitely is not authentic... but it's a fun, trendy place and the food is good. Hard Rock is always a fun atmosphere so Pink Taco fits right in there. I recommend the panuchos, or $1 taco and margarita happy hour. Can't go wrong with that! To go orders are really quick too... much appreciated on the way to work!
