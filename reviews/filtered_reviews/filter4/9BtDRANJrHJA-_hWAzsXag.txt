My sister and I were going to a move at Desert Ridge yesterday but wanted to grab some lunch first, we are Mexican food junkies, and since the only option at Desert Ridge was Rubio's, we decided to head a bit further North and go to Jalapenos. 

While I don't get here very often, I always am happy when I do. First off, the chips are awesome. The give you a mixed basket of corn and flour tortilla chips. Now I like tortilla chips in every shape and form, but the flour tortilla chips are a rarity, and when I see them, I pounce! They are so rich, they melt in your mouth, and are heavenly with the fresh, chunky salsa. 

I have had many things here, enchiladas, tacos, Mexican pizza, all of which are very good. I would really recommend the shredded beef, it is very moist and flavorful. I decided to try the spinach enchiladas yesterday, to see how they compared to my favorite ones at Arribas. I have to say, they were very different than the ones at Arribas, but they were very good. First off, they use a flour tortilla instead of corn, and they fill it with spinach and cheese, then cover them in read sauce with a dollop of their spinach con queso on top and sprinkled with sliced almonds. It is a very unique enchilada...and very yummy. 

The chips are what keep calling me back to here....but the rest of the food never disappoints either!
