Another point for the EASTCYDE! I had to check this place out because of all the positive reviews. I'm now a familiar face at Taco Taco Mexican Eatery.

This place has a very similar setup like Tacos El Gordo, but has a little more variety on the menu, a nice salsa station, and is much more spacious. 

I like the fact that you can order rice bowls, burritos, and grandes tacos from their menu. I tried their rice bowl with the al pastor. I was hoping to get the al pastor straight from the roasting spit, but it was taken from a container from that station. The rice bowl was okay, but I know it could've tasted better if the al pastor was freshly cut off of that beautiful stack of heavenly marinated pork. The al pastor burrito was alright also. It had pinto beans and I think rice. I can't say that I was a fan. My all time favorites are still the regular $2 al pastor tacos topped with pineapple. While waiting for my order, I'm checking out the tripas just chillen in the next station. The homie cuts me a few samples. MMMMMM grimey. I ended up ordering a couple of tripas tacos also. Soon after getting your order, you will find yourself at the salsa station. There is quite a variety of sauces to choose from. Their pico de gallo combo'ed with their other hot sauces is the winner. Don't forget to get some onions and peppers at the salsa station. I was hoping to see an Orange Bang on tap in the establishment. They didn't have my favorite drank whenever I'm eating tacos. They did however carry the Mexican bottled Coca Cola. Sugar sweatened Coca Cola tastes just like how it used to taste like when I was a kid. 

All in all, I really enjoyed stuffing my face at Taco Taco. Another great brick and mortar taco shop to spend my money at. SATISFIED!!!
