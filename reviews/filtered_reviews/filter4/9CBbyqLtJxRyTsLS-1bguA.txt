I am a fan of 25 cent Wing Wednesdays!!  
After having a few drinks at the Salty Senorita for happy hour we worked out way up the street for Wednesday Wings at Loco Patron.  When my friend said they have 25 cent wings, I grabbed my purse and hurried him along for wings.  

He has been a big fan Wednesday wings, he knew what he wanted and ordered them as soon as we sat down...A dozen hot!  I decided to look at the menu and glad I did.  I saw they offered Salt and Pepper wings, plain ol' crispy fried wings seasoned with salt and pepper.  These rocked!!  I ordered a dozen, even my friend was impressed!

The waitress kept the fresh tomato salsa coming with the chips.  Both good and homemade.  I was impressed.  My glass of water was always full and service friendly.
