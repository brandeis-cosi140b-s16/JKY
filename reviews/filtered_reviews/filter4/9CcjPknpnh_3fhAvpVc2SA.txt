After a long day of travel & convention set-up I was hungry & looking for some yummy eats. After an underwhelming culinary experience at the last hotel I stayed at (um a Toby Keith tribute bar is all you got? Really?) it was a pleasant change of pace to be in s hotel with multiple options.

I initially chose BG because I was thinking chips & a margarita would be the ultimate treat but after perusing the menu I settled on a black cherry mojito instead. The chips were amazing & crisp and I never once regretted my decision to sit on the patio. It overlooks the Mandalay Beach and the sight of palm trees, desert sky & a warm breeze was awesome. My drink arrived and didn't disappoint: slightly sweet syrup + fizz + mint = delicious! I decided on the grilled fish tacos and they arrived less than 10 minutes after I ordered, a definite plus since I was starving. The tacos themselves were delicious, the fish wasn't oily, the veggies were fresh and it was all topped off with a creamy sauce. I picked at the slightly underdone rice and suspiciously black as night beans and luckily had kept the chip basket to keep munching as I ate dinner.

Staff was friendly & very accomodating, my server was nice and offered her suggestions (hello mojito!) to make for a very enjoyable meal. I never felt abandoned or neglected & for those who dine solo this can sometimes be an issue. Thanks for a nice evening Vegas I'll never go back to that faux country western music video hell again!
