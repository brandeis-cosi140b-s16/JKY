The owner saw my review, and took the time to contact me.  I must say two things about this.... 

1. I honestly think that if more businesses took the time to check out their Yelp pages, then less businesses would have poor reviews. 

and 

2. If more businesses chose to do something to improve the perception of their business that the reviewer has in the case of poor reviews then more businesses would be flourishing.

That being said, I must praise Los Taquitos for doing both.  I have not had a chance to come in to eat again at the 16th st. location, but will make a point to do so in the near future....so look for another update.  But, if the personality and customer service that I received from the owner I spoke with (Rosie) shines through to the rest of her staff on my next visit, then I have no doubt my update will be a rave review!


Stay tuned........
