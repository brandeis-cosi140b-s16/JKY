Comedor Guadalajara was the place picked for May's breakfast club, let's just get the eh parts out of the way 1st, They do not take any reservations (so I was told) but they do have plenty of seating but you have to wait until at least Â¾ of your party is there before being seating.  2nd, they do no split the checks and they said only a max of 5 cards per check, so if you are coming with a party, make sure to bring cash, and take in to account that tip & tax is per everyone in the party, not just what you order. The bill was sort of a cluster, but we got through it.

I came for breakfast, but when I heard what my son was ordering dangit I wanted it too, plate envy right off the bat. I ordered the machaca chimichanga with verde sauce. It was shredded beef, eggs, jalapenos, onions & tomatoes, I figured even though it was on the regular menu and not breakfast, the fact that it had egg in it made it ok. 

The burrito was delish, the meat was tender and juicy the jalapenos fresh and vivid in color, the verde sauce was so good! Before I knew it the burrito was gone! It did come with a side of rice & beans as well.  Another great meal at Comedor Guadalajara, and fun time with the breakfast club!
