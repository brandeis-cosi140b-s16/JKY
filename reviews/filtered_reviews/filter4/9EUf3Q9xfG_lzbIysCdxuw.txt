The server apparently forgot to bring out our appetizer, but he was a nice guy in general and of course removed it from our bill, so no harm no foul. Mistakes happen.

The Hatch Chicken Especial was definitely worth it. The rest of my party seemed to enjoy their meals. The house Amber was also worth trying.
