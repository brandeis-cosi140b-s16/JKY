Is this some of the best Mexican food I have ever had? It sure as hell is. Went with a large group and they seated us in a pretty timely matter. I ordered the beef barbacoa enchiladas and it was delicious! Everything tasted fresh and not processed. The chips and salsa were also very good. I had the signature house margarita and it was probably one of the best margaritas I have ever had. But was it worth the $12 price tag? I'm not so sure about that one. 

Like most Vegas restaurants on the strip this place is extremely overpriced. Even if the food is great it's still not worth $18 for the moderate portions you get. And the drink is sure as hell not worth $12. Even though I liked the margarita I had 2 and barely had a buzz. I'm a lightweight so obviously there was not a lot of alcohol  in them. So a star taken off for that and for the obnoxious girl walking around on the mic bugging people.
