We came to the Monte Carlo to have dinner on Monday night (memorial day) because my fiance's friend really likes the place there called Pub & Brewery, but they were closed on Mondays ... (what something is closed in Vegas???).  so we spotted Diablo's... we were starving and so this is what we settled on.  We ordered the steak nachos which were awesome and pitcher of red sangria which also really really good.  I got steak tacos for my entree... had i known that they put some weird sauce on it that had the faint taste of yellow mustard I would have gone with my first choice of the Empanadas appetizer.  I really don't like special sauce of any kind... so that really bummed me out, but at least I filled up on nachos so I didn't leave hungry.  Others at the table seemed to really enjoy their food also.  My only complaint would be that the service was a little slow.
