I like the layout and atmosphere at this Dos Gringos. The had good prices on drinks and I thought their street tacos were really good. The crowd seems pretty chill and if it's too hot outside you can go inside like a wuss. I liked the Dos trailer park that used to be in Tempe as well but this one is better.
