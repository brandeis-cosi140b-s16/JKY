Okay seriously the best cocktail I've ever had in my life! I'm not exaggerating! The mango ginger margarita was unbelievable! I even dragged my friend back from another hotel the next day to have him try it- he agreed! This was about two years ago and I'm still having these fantasies of indulging in the cocktail once again.. Ok, about the food.. I had the shrimp quesadilla. It was very good; above average, however doesn't everything taste better when you're wasted?!  Cheers!
