Chino is great. My fave is the emerald chicken and egg foo yung. Listen people, it's all about the food! It's fresh, not frozen like one of the other reviewers insinuated. The Refried beans are BLACK Refried beans and they're freakin' addicting. Yes, it's a little messy at lunch time, but it's like a feeding frenzy at noon! They're getting the food out to hungry white collars, blue collars, golfers etc , they're not trying to white glove the place!  If you have a closed mind you'll be disappointed :-)
And for the reviewer who compared it to Chipotle....you're high to even put them in the same review.  
chipotle=chain
Chino=It's yummy, trust me.
