Javier's Oh Javiers!! Muchas gracias is all I have to say, and thank you to Aria for putting in this new gem just in time for our weekend getaway. We came here 3 times in the weekend that we were here so that says something about our feelings for Javier's. The place has such a cool atmosphere, ropes coming out of the bar, an incredible panel of skulls and all things scary carved out of wood on one side of the restaurant, really a site to see. The place has this intimate dark feel with mexican music always playing, it's like you just want to be there.

Now onto the important stuff, la comida which means food in Spanish. BEST SALSA I have ever had in my life, no seriously, and I'm from Chicago where we have some of the best Mexican restaurants around like Mercadito and Rick Bayless's Frontera Grill, but Javier's salsa and warm chips were just perfection. It was spicy yet flavorful and the chips were thin but not too thin and super crispy and fresh. And it's bottomless so does it get better than that? The one thing we weren't impressed by is the guacamole, it was a tad on the bland side, so if Javier's can kick start it or add some of those salsa ingredients that would be fab-u-lous! Our friends got the seafood quesadillas, nachos, enchiladas and they really enjoyed all.

Now the very best part, the margaritas! Those drinks kept us coming back for more and more, we could not get enough of them. They were the perfect combo of sweet, sour, savory, right amount of tequilla, and they were the regular ones, OH EM GEE, just amazing, I'll be dreaming of them forever. Or I'll go to Cabo as the server recommended to Javier's on the beach. The service isn't the best as I would agree with some of the reviews, but they are definitely sweet people working there. We left full, happy, and tipsy. Javier's was our Aria's guilty pleasure and it is open till 2am so that's a big plus! Will definitely be back!!!
