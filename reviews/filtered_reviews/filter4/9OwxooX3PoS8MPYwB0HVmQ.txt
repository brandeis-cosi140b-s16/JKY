For everyone who doesn't have the luxury of living near the San Diego/Mexico border, you can now get your Tacos El Gordo fix in beautiful Las Vegas.  For the uninitiated, it is absolutely worth visiting if you are a fan of authentic Mexican food.  Just beware of the ridiculous lines during lunch and the silly ordering system that works in theory but fails miserably in execution.

When you get there, you'll see that there are multiple lines for each of the meat stations.  Each station is supposed to be dedicated only to a particular type of meat or meats, but the lines aren't labeled and it's more of a free-for-all to get to the front than anything else.  To further cause problems, people will wait in one line (carnitas for example), but when they get to the front they order something that's supposed to be from another station (asada for example).  This causes delays because the guy at the carnitas station will have to ask the guy at the asada station to make something for the guy who stood in the wrong line in the first place, which causes both lines to get further backed up.  Confused yet?  Yeah, it's a big mess.

But let me save you the trouble of having to wait in multiples lines.  I've tried pretty much all the meats, and I can confidently say the only meat that really makes this place unique/special is the adobada (spicy pork aka al pastor).  It's frickin' delicious!  The meat has a perfect balance of crispiness and juiciness, and is packed with salty sweet flavor.  Whether you get it in a taco, tostada, quesadilla or whatever, I guarantee it will be good.  The other meat choices don't even hold a candle, but you can wait for them if you want.  You've been warned!
