The margaritas (on the rocks) are excellent! Their coconut margarita is fabulous! The atmosphere is great and they play good (classic rock) music. The food is just okay but then again, I'm not a fan of Tex-mex anyway! If you are looking for a place to relax with friends and have a few tasty margaritas, this is the place to come! Oh, as far as the service, I only delt With the bartenders and they were fine.
