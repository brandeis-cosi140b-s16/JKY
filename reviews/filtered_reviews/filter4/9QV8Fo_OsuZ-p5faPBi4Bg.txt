Food was good. Overall, 4 stars. I would return if I was in the area but wouldn't make the drive again from where I live.

Went in because my boyfriend bought the living social deal. The bartender who waited on us was nice and helpful and my margarita was delicious! 

The salsa has a hint of chipotle. Not bad but different than what you'd imagine. I had the agave enchiladas and I really liked them. The pork was excellent and so were the sauces on top. My boyfriend had the impressive chimichanga. It was absolutely huge - definitely enough for two. We both left with to go boxes. And my left overs were great for lunch today :)

The queso was alright- spinach queso isn't my favorite kind of queso but my boyfriend seemed to like it. 
 
It wasn't very busy either which was disappointing to see. I would guess its location that's hurting them but if you are the area, it's definitely worth a stop by. I will visit again if I am ever in that area :)
