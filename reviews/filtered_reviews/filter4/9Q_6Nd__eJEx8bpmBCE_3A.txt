Amazing little spot for sure. Love the decor, it looks like little MÃ©xico in there. 
We had a delicious chelada and bloody mary. I gotta say i have never had a hard time drinking a bloody mary before until today. Not because it wasn't good.. It was Great!! i loved that u could actually taste the vodka!! 
They gave us fruit with a yummy strawberry mouse to start instead of the usual chips and salsa.
I had the menudo and my husband had the chilaquiles. Both were delicious and served quick! We were also able to take advantage of the free churro dessert by checking in through yelp.
The service was amazing!!! They checked on you often and everyone was very polite. 
I am happy we found another great spot for mexican food.
