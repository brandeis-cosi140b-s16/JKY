Came here as part of our "Sunday Funday" on a weekend trip to Pittsburgh. Since it was a beautiful day, we were able to be seated next to the open front of the restaurant. We ordered margaritas which were decently priced and good. I am a bit of a margarita snob and I think these may have been made from a mix. We continued with some chicken nachos which were awesome. The chips were delicious and loaded with delicious cheesiness, salsa, guacamole, beans and sour cream.

What I have failed to mention is the interior of the restaurant. It is spacious and bright and seems like a great place to have a party. Service is really fast and friendly. A fun place to hang out!
