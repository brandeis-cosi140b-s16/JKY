This restaurant is just as good as it's original location in South Phoenix.  With that said I would rate Carolina's as the best fast food Mexican eatery in the Phoenix metro.  You really can't get any better than this, you can try, but I doubt you will.

The location for the West Valley isn't bad right off of the 101 and Peoria Avenue.  Pretty centrally located considering the area.  The place is always clean, the workers are very friendly and add to a welcoming experience.

You really can't beat the prices for the quality that you're getting.  The place is always busy and I can totally see why.  Serving very tasty food at a low price.  What else can you ask for?
