Braddah's is like the island style of Chipotle.  You can get a bowl, burrito, or tacos and tacos and guac on the side if you like.  

It was my first time here, so one of the guys who worked there gave me a sample of each meat: Kahlua pig, chicken, and steak.  The kahlua pig was a bit salty (but most kahlua pig I've tried are a bit salty), so I decided to go half and half with the chicken and steak bowl.  

I'm trying to remember all the toppings I picked because I probably picked about 90% of what they had. You have your choice of mild, med, or hot sauce.  I got my mild sauce (which is green and includes pineapples) and the hot sauce/salsa was good.  They were very generous with the guac.  

Also got some sour cream, cheese, lettuce, and tortilla strips.  I'm sure I got more toppings, but that's all I can remember.  

The only downside was the utensils - they seemed dirty.  Not sure if it was the water spots or what, but they didn't seem clean.  

I used a Groupon deal: $7.50 for $12 worth of food.  This typically gives you a bowl with a drink.  I'm wondering if I was charged extra for the guac.  

Also, the coconut bark was fantastic!  I normally don't like coconut, but this chocolate and caramel dessert was excellent.
