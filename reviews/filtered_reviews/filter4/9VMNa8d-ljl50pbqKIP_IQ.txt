Really good tacos here. I like to go for Taco Tuesdays! $1.25 per taco from 2-10pm every Tuesday. Great deal. I normally prefer steak/carne asada to chicken at taco joints but at Backyard Tacos, I enjoy them both. I like that you can choose between corn or flour tortillas, also. 

The Papa Locos are good also. It's basically a baked potato topped with meat of your choice, shredded cabbage, pico & salsa. Its pretty awesome. 

They have a variety of salsas here. I can't ever remember which one I like so I always take home one of each of the 4 offered. I know one is spicy as hell. Way too spicy for me but my BF likes it. I think it's the green one if I recall. 

Only con is that its pretty dang small. There's barely any standing room while you're waiting for your order. I constantly have to maneuver around people while waiting because you're either blocking the trash can, the door or the salsa bar. Fortunately the food is ready pretty quick so it's not too bad.
