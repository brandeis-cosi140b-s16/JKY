Incredible atmosphere, delicious gourmet food and super friendly service.  We'll be back soon, for sure!

The building alone is worth the trip - the resturant is inside a beautiful old church, complete with high ceilings, stained glass window and atmosphere out the wazoo!  The trappings of the restaurant (tables, bar, etc.) are blended nicely into this gorgeous setting.   

Excellent food:  The guacamole was delightfully fresh and delicious and the complimentary salsa was tasty (chips - a bith thick for my taste, but fresh).  The tacos really stole the show.  I got the Thai Snapper taco and the Shrimp Taco, and both were super impressive!  I was delighted to discover that, in addition to corn or flour tortillas, you can order them in lettuce wraps!!  I'm not a huge fan of tortillas, and this means I can fit more guacamole in my tummy, plus the lettuce is fresh and delicious, giving the tacos a lovely summery lightness.  I also had a bite of the seasonal vegetable taco, which somehow tasted even better than mine - woah!  The seasonal veggie side was small and tasty, too (I sampled my husband's).

We took advantage of the Sunday Happy Hour (starts at 2pm, all day!) and had beers and wines at a bargain to complement our tasty eats.  Their beer list is short but super local - Four Peaks, Oak Creek, Cartel.  Our server was funny and attentive (excellent drink refills).  Overall, a big win!
