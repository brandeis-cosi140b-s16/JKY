SumoMaya combines a party atmosphere, a bar, and a sit down restaurant all into one. For those looking for somewhere hip to drink and/or eat, you've definitely come to the right place!

We ordered enough food quite possibly for a small army, including 2 types of guacamole, sushi rolls, ceviche, kimchee fried rice, various tacos, and chile-crab garlic noodles. The sushi roll we had (Shishito roll) was just average. The slight bitter flavor of the shishito pepper, which can be a delectable taste for the senses when roasted, didn't quite mesh with the sweetness of the kiwi + mango-habanero sauce for me. Other fusion items we had were tantalizing though. Some notable dishes were the Singapore crab noodles and the al pastor tacos. The strong flavors of the meat with seasoning contrasted well with the starch component in each dish.

For dessert, they have various options such as cheesecake, mochi, and chocolate cake. 

Service was decent for a bustling and busy weekend night. One of the co-owners came by to check up on us and see how we were enjoying things, a nice touch!

Since this is such a vibrant atmosphere, it's not quite the place you'd want to take someone for an intimate evening where you can engage in deep conversation, especially when Kris Kross's "Jump" is playing on the loudspeakers (Admit it- you know you'd want to jump along with the music!). :)
