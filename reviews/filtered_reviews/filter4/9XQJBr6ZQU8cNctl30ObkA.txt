Had to try this place out because of the good reviews. Ordered the "Super Nachos" w/ chicken, carne asada burrito, and of course their fish tacos. Fish tacos are one of my all-time favorite foods and I order them everywhere .. and I gotta say their's are very good. And oh man, they put 2 HUGE pieces of fish in each taco. Delicious. As for the nachos, they were okay but I found the chicken a little dry .. maybe try a different meat on those next time. The burrito was quite tasty as well and also on the large side. Good mexican food, good service. And you can get your car cleaned while you eat!
