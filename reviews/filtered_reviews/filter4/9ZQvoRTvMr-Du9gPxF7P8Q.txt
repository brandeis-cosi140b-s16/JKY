Finally stopped in after driving by for years, wish I would of came by years ago! Great food in an original atmosphere. 

The food had good taste, guacamole was fresh made and awesome, cheese crisps are wonderful, and the burrito was filling to the point I needed to take it home. 

Service was fast and friendly with no issues.
