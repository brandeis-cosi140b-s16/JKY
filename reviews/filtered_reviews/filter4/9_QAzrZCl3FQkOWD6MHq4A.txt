There are a lot of things to like about this place.  Ive only been once so far but I do plan on coming back to try other menu options.  When I was standing in line deciding what to order I saw the cooks making nachos for someone else, they looked good so I decided to order that.  I really like the way they prepare the nachos and really melting the cheese good.  Not too many toppings, really only cheese, beans (Black or Pinto), choice of meats, pico, sour cream, and guacamole...but the guacamole is really good and they gave me a huge amount of it.  They also have a salsa bar with lots of salsas to choose from, and even some beans and vegetables.  The price was great, less than 7 bucks.  I like that everything is being made fresh right in front of you.  You can watch them make the taco shells from scratch.  I really want to go back and try those tacos, they looked really really yummy.  It was good food, good service, a clean place so nothing really to complain about.  At the same time I wasn't blown away by anything either so 4 stars sounds about right.
