Secreto is one of my favorite restaurants in Ahwatukee especially because it's hard to find non-chain restaurants around here.  The atmosphere is really cool and the food is amazing.  I'm not a big fan of beef or pork so that really limits my options but the Madres Pasta Favorito is amazing!  It has the best sauce I've ever had and the shrimp and guacamole salsa add the perfect touch.  Make sure you save room for dessert because the flan is to die for.  The only negative thing I would say is that we made a reservation and they forgot about us so we waited for a long time.  I don't really mind though because we were enjoying drinks at the bar.
