Beautiful building inside and out.  Nice relaxing atmosphere inside.  Service was good and quick.  They serve chips and salsa while you wait for your meal.  They were delicious.  They give you three different homemade salsas.  I loved the green one.  I ordered the carne asada tacos.  The carne came in a bowl filled with sauce. Only thing I didn't like about it.  It was like a stew and hard to pull the meat out to put on the tortilla.  Tortillas were fresh and prices are reasonable. Overall it was a good experience, had a great time  and I'll be back.
