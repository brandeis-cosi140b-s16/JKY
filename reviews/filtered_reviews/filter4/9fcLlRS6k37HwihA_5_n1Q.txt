This cafe gem was created by the Chef and owner of Gallo Blanco Caf√© -- as a huge fan of GBC, I was looking forward to this restaurant. Atmosphere is nice and cozy.

I ventured out with three friends so we could each order a differ entree and sample & taste.  Chips & salsa were hot and tasty. I had the Caldo de Pollo con Fideo Chino & an Otro salad (Gotta keep it light to maintain my Size 4 figure!!!) --- simply delish. I had samples of the Mole Negro -- YUMMILICIOUS! The Paella Mexicana wasn't a fave but it's something I would never order for myself. Overall, I loved the food and definitely look forward to sharing more times with good friends here at Otro Cafe.
