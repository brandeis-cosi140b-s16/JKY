An unexpected find. A very homey and comfortable place. Food was fabulous! Had a steak chimichanga.....of which I've never tried before and it was amazing. The crispy outside and packed with goodness inside was just wonderful. The downfall is the portion size is enough to feed two people....so you will need to take the rest home..or share. :)
