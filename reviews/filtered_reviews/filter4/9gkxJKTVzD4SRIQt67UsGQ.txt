When you're deciding on what to order at Cabo, stick with what they do best - fish tacos.  I've had fish tacos from all across the country from North Carolina to California and I can safely say these are some of the best I've ever had.  Always fresh, always delicious.  The taste and consistency is on point.  The chips and corn salsa are delicious as well, although sometimes the chips are a little on the cold side.  The atmosphere is great!  It has a very trendy and hip vibe right in the heart of NoDa.  I usually try and visit earlier in the afternoon for dinner as it gets pretty busy later at night and there's usually a long wait.  It's also extremely loud when you visit during the peak hours.
