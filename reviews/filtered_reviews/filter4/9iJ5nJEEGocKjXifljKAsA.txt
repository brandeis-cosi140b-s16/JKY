The great thing about this place when I went was that happy hour was on (4pm-7pm). All the bottled beer and margaritas were buy one, get one free. They also had great chips that were fresh and warm each time we got them, which also came with some tasty salsa (guacamole was the best) for FREE! The appetizer platter was another item we ordered, which included quesadillas, corn tamales (if you ever had Chevy's corn tamale, it is better than this!), beef and chicken skewers, and some kind of fried wrapped potato thing with cheese. BTW, the food was also 1/2 off. Not too bad for celebrating our end of the semester party with a group of about 20+ crazy nursing students!
