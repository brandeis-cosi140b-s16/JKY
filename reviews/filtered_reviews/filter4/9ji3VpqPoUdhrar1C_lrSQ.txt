You need to come here with the right expectations.  China Poblano is a Mexican-Chinese hybrid/fusionish restaurant by Jose Andres.  Portions are on the smaller side while prices are on the larger side.  Modern, more asian design/decor and it's in the Cosmopolitan hotel near the upper level of the chandelier bar.  There...with that said, on to the food.

We had the heavenly pigs (roasted pork buns with condensed milk), a 20 (or 24) veggie fried rice, ha-gau (shrimp dumplings) and a vegan mexican spiced hand cut noodle dish.  Honestly the food was pretty good.  Everyone really liked the heavenly pigs though it was only 4 buns for 14 bucks.  the condensed milk really brought the little piggies to another level.  Best plate by far.  The fried rice was done really well, but nothing exceptional.  Shrimp dumplings were really fresh and also done well (again expensive, but that's a given here).  The hand cut noodle dish was interesting.  nice amount of heat and also nothing I've ever had before.  

Overall 4 stars.  The food is good and interesting.  Pricey and the service wasn't great.  It's worth a stop if you're looking to try something different or to get a quick bite.
