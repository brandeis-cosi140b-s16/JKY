This is certainly not your typical mexican restaurant with classic tacos/burritos and a side of refried beans.  This place redefines mexican cuisine.  Instead of nachos/salsa, they gave me small slices of bread and some sort of chopped olive salad.  It was a refreshing change to say the least.  I forgot the name, but I ordered the steak filet covered in crab meat and smothered in a perfect amount of mole sauce I think.  Oh my that was tasty.  The flavor was so new to me that I can't even compare it to anything I had before.  The steak was cooked to perfection and even the side of veges was fantastic.  I got the crepe dessert which was equally delicious.  The only downside was the price but that's not really something to expect with this quality of food.  The place is also kinda on the small side so I'm sure it gets packed during rush hours.
