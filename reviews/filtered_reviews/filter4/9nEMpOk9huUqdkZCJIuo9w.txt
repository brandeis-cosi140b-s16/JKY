This is one of the only good restaurants in it's neighborhood, so weekend nights are standing room only in the lobby. The food is very good. The beans are a little sweet, which is odd, but not bad.  They have this cheesy rice casserole with mild (poblano?) chiles that is really tasty. I always get the same thing - the chile relleno with cheese (not beef) and it is great. I have probably been here at least 10 times, and only had an issue once. I'd call that a good run.
