Ok, so it's not authentic Mexican food...it's an American taco shop and it was a good one.  We stopped in for lunch with some out of towners and the food was pretty good.  I can only imagine how these tacos must hit the spot after a night of bar hopping.  

When we walked in we were greeted by a very friendly girl at the counter.  I ordered the grilled shredded pork sandwich with a side of Mexican fried potatoes and I actually had to take half of it home because the portions were huge.  My meal turned out to be very tasty so I was kind of excited that I now had dinner too...and all for less than $10...no complaints here!
