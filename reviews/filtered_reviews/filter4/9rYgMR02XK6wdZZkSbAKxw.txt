love the food, the service and the atmosphere downtown.  Tried the new location in summerlin, it was horrible...the food was terrible, the music too loud, the atmosphere cold and like a fast food eatery.  Our food was cold and had to send it back twice, finally gave up and just took it home and heated it up.  it's not the same as the downtown cooks.  Don't go to that location.   Sadly as its closer to where we might go more often.
