Had it not been for Yelp, I may have gone my whole life without eating here.  I have to believe that because I've driven by this place SO many times and went "Oh, Mexican food place" and within a few miles I'd forgotten all about it.  Silly me.

So this place totally started out as a house.  Lots of little rooms and funky spaces.  There are actually two different entrances - neither one as the official "main" entrance.  And conveniently there are two different counters at which you can order on the busy night we were there, I didn't see more than 2 people in line at any one time.  Order food at the window.  They call your name and you go grab your food.  Chips and salsa are $.50 and while they aren't particularly exceptional, it's worth grabbing especially if there are several of you.  

I got a combo to try some traditional standards.  Prices are cheap which is great.  My combo (6.95), drink (1.75) and Chips(0.50) and salsa came out to just 9.95 after tax.  The taco was really good, a bit greasy, but not bad at all.   The enchilada was really amazing.  The sauce wasn't your average sauce - it had a nice kick.  The burrito was a joke.  I hardly ate any after the other two, but I had to at least try it after hearing such good things.  Very yummy - though I really want to try the bean burrito after all the great things said in prior reviews.  

But that - will be next time.  And my friend and I have already talked about our next trip here.  Quick, inexpensive and good quality food.  

Special note - When headed there don't forget that this is on 7th ave so you can't use the turn lane during rush hours.  Make sure you're headed the right way to make sure that isn't an issue!
