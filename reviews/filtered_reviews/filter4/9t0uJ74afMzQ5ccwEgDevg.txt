I really enjoyed my brunch here! We tried several things since items are served tapas style. This is a big plus for me since I can never decide on one item to try. I love options!

Green Corn Tamale - Very good! Slightly sweet tamale served with pico de gallo and sour cream. A good combination of both sweet and savory.

Yucatan Egg Benedict - very different from traditional eggs benedict, but delicious. They are served on a homemade corn biscuit and topped with shredded pork. Yum! 

Mexican Rice pudding parfait - I love rice pudding! This wasn't the best I've had, but good. 

Plantain empanadas - These were good but probably my least favorite part of the meal. 

Machaca Chilaquiles - everyone at the table agreed that the chilaquiles were the best item we ordered. Very cheesy and flavorful.

Peruvian Shrimp and Grits - another favorite. I loved the sauce! The grits were also quite tasty. 

Guava Empanadas - flaky and perfectly sweet. 

Fruit - Fresh except for the strawberries. Slightly disappointing since strawberries are my favorite. It included honeydew, cantaloupe, strawberries and pineapple. 

Bottomless Kinky Mimosa (passion fruit, pomegranate and blood orange) - yum! I'd never think to combine those flavors in one drink, but I approve!

I would highly recommend checking this place out!
