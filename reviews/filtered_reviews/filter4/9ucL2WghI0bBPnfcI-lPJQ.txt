I found out about PVBC from a friend who posted the weekly special on Facebook. A double patty topped with jalapeno, bacon, bbq sauce, blueberry cream, and corn bread crumbles! I was intrigued by the unique combination of ingredients and had to have it ASAP! It did not disappoint! I also ordered a side of seasoned fries and a Lucky Charms shake. The fries were good nothing to brag about. The shake was amazeballs. I like that they're not stingy with condiments. They have a free for all supply of their house sauce in the soda pop refrigerator perfect for your fries or burger. I'll be back before I start my diet next week!
