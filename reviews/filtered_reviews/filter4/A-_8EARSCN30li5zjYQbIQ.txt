This place came highly recommended by my son.  So we buzzed into this neat little complex.  Found the restaurant and sat outside watching the nursing students go by.  I ordered a house special margarita, that they will only sell two of to you.  The drink was made out of fresh juices and a healthy pour of tequila. Wow it was delicious. 

A unique basket of chips was dropped off at out table.  Different kinds of chips with a great spice on them and what appeared to be a restaurant made salsa.  Absolutely delicious.  Really, fantastic flavors in a great combination. 

Had a chimichangas for my meal.  It was really good as well.  Crunchy outside with a real intense flavored chicken inside.

I will without a doubt return next time I am in Phoenix.
