Pros: Great food, Professional staff
Cons: Slow service, Expensive drinks

On June 4th, I stopped by Habanero's on the corner of Butherus Dr and Northsight Blvd for some tacos. It was 2:00pm, and hoped I'd missed the lunch crowed. I wasn't expecting many people to be eating during that time. The line at the lunch counter was about five people deep when I walked up and another three people were waiting to pay at the register. I've heard this place could get busy, but this was a little too much of a wait for me.

Other than the wait, my experience at Habanero's Mexican Grill was positive. Again, the staff is friendly and tacos are great! This is the only reason I decided to wait out the line for a table. If you ever find yourself waiting and thinking about going somewhere else. Don't do it, tacos are worth the wait.
