I went to the Crescent Ballroom to see Phantogram with local opening act YUS on November 5, 2011. I have been waiting to see the new venue everyone has been talking about for quite some time. Knowing that looking at reviews before going would narrow my thoughts; I refrained and went with an open mind. I noticed that the venue was also a bar/restaurant which I found pretty cool. When I arrived and presented my ticket to the hostess in the front of the venue, I was left confused as to why I was sent to enter through the back of the venue rather than the front. I later realized that the venue was split into two parts, one for those under 21 and one for those 21 and older. Me being placed in the 21 and under section I was pleased to see that they had free lemon water along with benches to rest on. I went to the restroom within the first few minutes of being in the venue and was dissatisfied with the low lighting due to me not being able to see my belt loops. 
The show started at around eight forty five with opening act YUS, who played about a forty five minute set. I really enjoyed his music and knowing that he was local added to the enjoyment. I also couldn't help to notice the quality of the sound coming from the speakers; it had the best treble to bass ratio I have heard in an Arizona venue. Knowing that Phantogram has a far heavier sound than YUS I was really interested in seeing how to speakers would size up. To my surprise the sound was great, along with an amazing light show. The synchronization of the lights with the beat of the music greatly added to my appreciation for this venue.
Overall I was really impressed with the newest addition to venues in the metropolitan area. Though the lighting in the bathroom was very dim and the separation of the venue was somewhat irritating, I had nothing but an awesome experience. I would suggest anyone who has an interest in independent music to check the lineup for this venue and attend.
