We really liked this place, the hand made corn tortillas made the meal, I didn't like the salsa they brought with the chips but when I asked for something hotter they gave us the good stuff. The second time we went they didn't have the fresh tortillas because they only make them at certain times of day. Next time I will keep that in mind.
