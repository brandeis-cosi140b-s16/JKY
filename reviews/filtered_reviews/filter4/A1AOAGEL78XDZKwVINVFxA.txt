We went to La Hacienda for dinner last night to celebrate my birthday. What a beautiful place! Nice atmosphere and pretty setting in the Fairmont Hotel.
Our server was very friendly and attentive and gave us good recommendations. We tried the prickly pear margarita-sweet and delicious! Appetizers were great too-fundido, empanadas, and elote. Chips and salsa were complimentary and they were fresh and plentifuL. For our entrees, my husband had the short ribs. Good size portion and wonderful flavors. I had the lobster tacos with a side of rice. The flavors were amazing! Our children had fajitas, steak quesadillas, and chicken tacos. All of their meals were tasty and good portion sizes. Dessert was amazing-churros with 3 dipping sauces in edible cups, a homemade chocolate cookie and the most delicious Tres Leches cake ever! It had a layer of flan and coconut frosting. I'm still dreaming about it! We will definitely be back.
