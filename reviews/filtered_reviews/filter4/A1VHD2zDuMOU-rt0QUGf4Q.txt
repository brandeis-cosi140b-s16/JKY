First time there. Nothing special about establishment, but it was clean.  Service- the cashier made some suggestions on the menu and was courteous.  I got the paradise burger with the addition of bacon and cheese.  Everything looked freshly cooked (beef and bacon).  The veggies looked fresh, and the cheese seemed like a thick slice cut from an actual block of cheese - not some imitation cheese-spread crap.  This $7 burger was well worth it based on the freshness of ingredients.  As for taste...well it tasted great.  I probably could have made just as good of burger on the grill at home with the same ingredients, but this was made for me in less than 10 minutes without the hassle.  I'll take it.  I only got a coke to go with it, so can't comment on any of the sides.
