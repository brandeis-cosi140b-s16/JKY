I was hesitant on trying Juan's, as I fellow Yelper who I respect, totally slammed this place, several years ago.  Well, I am glad I did give this place a chance.  For what it is (cheap Mexican food place) it is very good.  I did not love the chips and salsa (free) but the food was fresh and tasty.  Refried Beans, great, rice was so, so.  Their taco's reminded us of a famous taco place in California (Tito's) they do serve beer and wine (wine is super cheap at $2.50 per glass) our server was really nice.
