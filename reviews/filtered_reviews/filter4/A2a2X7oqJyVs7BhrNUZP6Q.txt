BF and I walked into the store looking confused and were immediately greeted and asked if it was our first time there. We were then offered at least 6-7 different samples of the most popular things on the menu. After she saw that we loved all the spicy things she went to the back and grabbed us an additional sample of the pollo diablo.

I got the combo with a jerk chicken quesadilla, pollo diablo, black beans, and white rice. The BF got the emerald chicken quesadilla, jade red chicken, jerk fried rice, and black beans. 

We took a seat and got comfortable and was pleasantly surprised when our food came out within 5 minutes. First thing I noticed was how greasy everything was. My quesadilla was dripping oil. My jerk chicken quesadilla was ok, the seasoning on the chicken was lost and it just tasted like a regular quesadilla. My BFs emerald chicken quesadilla was SO good though (even with the dripping grease) the green onion and ginger made it very refreshing. I loved the slight sweetness of the black beans and the seasoning on my diablo chicken.

Portions were just ok for the price we paid $17 for the two combos. I'm saying this because my bf finished his portion without any problems and I purposefully saved some for breakfast the next day. We can normally share a meal from panda. 


P.S. Everything was even better the next day!
