I've been here twice now. The first time I ordered their Fiesta Chicken Nachos. They were absolutely delicious. They have an individual size and an entree sized portion. The next time I went I sprang for the entree sized portion of the BBQ Chicken Nachos and noticed no difference in portion size. So just get the individual size and save yourself $4. Both types of nachos were delicious and their White Peach Margarita is absolutely incredible. Staff is friendly. Food comes out within a reasonable amount of time. Their patio is great at night.
