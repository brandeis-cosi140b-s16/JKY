Going up, on a Tuesday! Taco Tuesday's here to be exact, but two items get one free, such an amazing deal! So yeah, they fried fish tacos are delicious, they come on a flour tortilla and you have an enormous selection of salsas and amazing slaw and other vegetables. Will update again on my fourth visit :)
