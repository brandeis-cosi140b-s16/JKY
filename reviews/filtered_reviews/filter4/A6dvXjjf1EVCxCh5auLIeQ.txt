This is always on the "must go to" list when I have out of town guests.  The patio is really, really nice - especially if you can get the private patio off to the side (you need to request it - and have a large party) with its own private fireplace and view of the grassy gardens in the back.  I am a huge fan of the seafood enchiladas - and the flying saucers are really good too!
