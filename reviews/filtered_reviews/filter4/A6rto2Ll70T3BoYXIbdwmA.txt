This is where I fell in love with authentic tacos and the fries are heavenly. If you are visiting Vegas this is a great place to eat but be ready for a line. It was around 2 in the morning Vegas time and my husband and I had to wait an hour in line to get to our food. It was nice getting to know people in the process. Lots of locals. Total Dive. Get the tacos and the fries. The prices are phenomenal as well. Highly recommend.
