This place seems like it's ALWAYS busy around lunch time and usually there isn't anywhere to sit unless you happen to catch people leaving and just grab their table and it isn't too dirty because I've never seen anyone come around and wipe tables down between customers.

The 4 stars come from food alone.  The homemade tortillas are amazeballs (and I don't even like tortillas, I'm a rice kinda girl).  The salad (basically an unwrapped burrito) is soooo good and huge.  I can barely finish 1/2 a salad.  I usually get a grilled chicken salad with everything on it.  I'd recommend getting the tortilla on the side though, because it'll get soggy at the bottom of your salad.  The green house ranch dressing thing they have is delicious as well.

I also like the drink and tea selection and I like that they encourage you to mix their drinks into different combinations.

Service at this location is just okay, nothing outstanding.

Also, if you have a sensitive stomach and GI tract, i would be cautious.  Some people end up getting Cafe Rio stomach (which is fairly comparable to Chipotle stomach) if you know what I mean.  If you don't, then don't worry about it!
