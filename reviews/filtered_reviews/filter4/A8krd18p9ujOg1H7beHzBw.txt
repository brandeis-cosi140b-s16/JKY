Right around the corner from my sister's ghetto-tastic shack, this place is bomb. Green chile tostada...hell yes! 

The place is not much to look at from the outside, not much to savor on the inside, but the only people hanging out here are Chandler High kids escaping 4th period. 

You stand in line, you get your paper bag of greasy goodness, you leave with a smile on your face. 

You hope your sister has beer in the fridge when you get back to her place.
