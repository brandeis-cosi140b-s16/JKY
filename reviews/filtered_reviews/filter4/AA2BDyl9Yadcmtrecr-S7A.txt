I've been here a couple of times, and while I find the service only average, the food is amazing!  I ordered seafood tacos the first time and chicken the second (both were wonderful, but really recommend trying the seafood), but from sampling off friends' plates, I feel confident in saying there is nothing bad on the menu.  Everything was delicious!
