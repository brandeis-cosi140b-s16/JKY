It is just North of Dunlap and Central on the West hand side.

But, it was a nice mexican restaraunt with very YUMMY chicken enchiladas for great prices. Lately I haven't been liking the red sauce that comes on enchiladas, but this red sauce was killer!! And served with the traditional rice and beans. I love when you get those great big plates for nothing of a price, and the free appetizer of chips and salsa (they gave two different salsas!). Also, they had house margaritas, small one was only $1.99, not even on happy hour!! they weren't holden back on the tequila either!
Service was very nice. Highly recommend for some good cheap margaritas and food with flava!!
