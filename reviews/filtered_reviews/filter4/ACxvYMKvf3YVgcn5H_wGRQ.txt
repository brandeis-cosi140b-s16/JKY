Went for a late lunch.  Guacamole was good, as was the sangria margarita that I had (yes, it's a mix of the two, forgot what the actual name was called).

Got a torta, and the meat was marinated well.  A little sweet but not too sweet.  Portion size was huge.  The fish tacos were good also.

Service left more to be desired and I'm particularly irked that they didn't log in my Opentable reservation.  I was contacted by Opentable after my visit asking why I didn't show up for my reservation.  It all got sorted out but shouldn't have happened in the first place.
