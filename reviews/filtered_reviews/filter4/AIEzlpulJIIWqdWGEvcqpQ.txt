This was a great find. We were overwhelmed with the menu. We got the chorizo and carne nachos, the special of the day shrimp Mexicana, and two tacos. All was great! Service was great and they had beer wine etc. 
  The Habanero salsa was screaming and the tortilla's fresh and homemade. Boy I wish we could get this kind of Mexican at home! PS Cheap too!
