A few nights ago I found out that The Voice wanted to feature me on their fan spotlight. Of course, we had to go out and celebrate.

The feel and vibe is awesome. The perfect place to sip down a few margaritas and forget it's the weeknight. Oops!

The food was good. The chips and salsa are amazing. We both had tacos. In honesty, the margaritas were a little too amazing and the food is hard to remember. 

We'll be back for more food, and I'll update soon!
