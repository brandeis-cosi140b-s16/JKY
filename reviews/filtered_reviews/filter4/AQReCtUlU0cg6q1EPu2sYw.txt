Two words: POLLO FUNDIDO. I swear they put some sort of addictive chemical in this dish that makes you crave it everyday. It has a ridiculous amount of calories and fat. My ass jiggles for about a week after I eat this dish and therefore I can only have it about once or twice a year. I eat it and then go take a nap. Then I get up from my nap, go to the fridge, get out the leftovers and eat the rest of it....then I go back to bed. Then I dream about it. DAMN YOU POLLO FUNDIDO! This stuff is my kryptonite.
