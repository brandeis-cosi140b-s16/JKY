Husband and I were craving Mexican food. We wanted to relax and chill on our date night so we came across Lindo. I love the area, especially because it's close to us. I've heard many people rave about this place so we decided to try it! 

As soon as we walked in, you can smell the deliciousness of the Mexican food. Hostess greeted us and were very friendly. It was a little loud, but we don't really mind the loudness. The atmosphere was really nice and kid friendly and the hostess sat us at a table with the best view of Vegas. It felt really nice. 

It took us a few mins to go over the menu, which has plenty of choices from combos to ala carte. I ended up getting the 2 burrito combo which had shredded beef and tender pork with green sauce, served with Mexican rice, beans and a small portion of salad. Hubby got the 3 enchilada combo with beef, chicken and pork with the same sides. Both for $15 each. 

As we were waiting for our food, they brought us home made crispy tasty tortilla chips with with mild or spicy salsa and bean dip which was yummy. 

Once our order came to the table, the plate was super hot, we had to wait a bit. The portions were really big, I mean for $15 I'd hope they were big. So I took a bite out of my beef burrito and this is where my 4 starts come in. My beef burrito was really really dry and I'm not sure if it was that day they had over cooked it or that's really how they cook their beef. My pork burrito was very tender and was really tasteful and I loved it. Same thing goes for hubby's chicken and beef enchiladas. 

Ordered tres leches cheese cake which was yummy. Other than that. I still yet have to try the rest of the food.
