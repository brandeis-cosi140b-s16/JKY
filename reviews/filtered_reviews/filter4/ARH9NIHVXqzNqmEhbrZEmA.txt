Great Mexican food  we had the fried grasshoppers for starters. Unfortunately not everybody in our group liked them. In fact I was the only one. We had a large group 11 adults and 5 kids. So we ordered the Grande for $195.00. Perfect choice tons of great Mexican food. Paco the Chef was very friendly. Real cool guy. I gave them 4 stars because they wouldn't give us a bigger table so we had to squeeze together.  Great place though highly recommend the place.
