I liked the funky modern atmosphere.  I sat outside, it was humid without misters but wasn't too bad. Only negative was the lighting - there wasn't enough. Other than that the patio was legit.

Service was good. Food was even better. Taco Monday?! Who knew this was a thing. Diego Pops originators of the taco Monday kick though! We ordered 1 of each their 7 tacos featured (plenty more to select from) these were the $2 or $3 deal. Favorite was the cod, salmon, green chili chicken. 

They have a killer selection of sauces/salsas they bring out too which only adds to your dish! Chips and salsa were on point, salsa was chunky and had a good kick.

Best part... CHOCO TACO!

definitely a spot to go check out.
