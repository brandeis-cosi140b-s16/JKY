What a great find! First visit. The waiters were amazing! The chips are fresh and crisp and you get beans, and two types of salsa right away. We ordered and had food within 15 minutes. Their guacamole is absolutely delicious! Honey had a carne asada burrito and the steak was juicy and tender. Everything was phenomenal. Hernan, our waiter, was very attentive and checked on us every 7-10 minutes to make sure everything was perfect. This is definitely going to be added to our date night rotation! 4 stars for first visit, but will easily become 5 stars if the service is as awesome next time!
