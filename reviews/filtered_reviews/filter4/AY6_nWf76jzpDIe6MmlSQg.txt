$1 beer for the ladies on Wednesday...can't beat that!  The nachos are the best I've had in Vegas!  Smoking outside only.  The chairs are not particularly comfortable, but with drop down roll shades, it's a pleasant outdoor area, especially if cruising with a pooch.  The decor is pretty cool and I dig the genderless and spacious bathrooms.  Only draw back: the place is a magnet for hipsters.  You definitely have to make room for the hairdos and shoe gazers, which for some may actually be a plus!
