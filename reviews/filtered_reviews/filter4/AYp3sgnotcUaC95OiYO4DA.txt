Can't say I go out for "upscale" Mexican food often, but when I was sitting outdoor at Poppy Den, I saw Cantina Laredo's outdoor dining space and thought it would be a great place for a few drinks oh and some food too.   Anyway, came here with my husband and two dogs just before noon on a Monday.  I walked into the restaurant to ask for a table outside, but was shocked when the restaurant was completely empty, I thought it was still closed, but it wasn't. The host showed me a table outside, but we requested to be near railing to tie up the dogs and he happily let us to choose it. No bowl of water for the dogs, but that is ok...we had one.

We ordered a few glasses of wine which averaged $9/glass from a list of 12  wines..all decent and familiar.  The pour was atleast 6 oz., which is generous these days. Then I ordered the two appetizers for my lunch because they had the fewest carbs...ceviche and tuna mini tacos. My husband got one of the enchiladas entrees.   The ceviche was decent and fresh, but probably a bit salty for most people...I liked it, especially paired with my glass of Brut.  The tuna in my tacos was unexpectedly sweet, but with a little salsa and habanero sauce (we requested)...it tasted really good.  However, limiting my sugar and starch intake, my husband finished it off. He said his enchilada was solidly good, but said I make better enchiladas at home.  I did train him well.  

So why 4 stars?  Love dog friendly places, the price to portion to quality ratio was all good, and service was quick and attentive, but that could be because there were only 6 people in the entire restaurant. 

Let's see if the next time I come here my experience is just as good.
