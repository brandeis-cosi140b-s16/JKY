Went with some friends from out of town who had never been to Scottsdale waterfront.  After a little walking we decided on Barrio Queen. All 3 guys ordered the California Enclilada plates which came with beans and some  I picked the 3 tacos (pollo, carne Asada, pork).   All were delicious.  It was just enough to fill me up.  Oh, I also had a glass go white Sangria...it was okay. I would try the red next time.
