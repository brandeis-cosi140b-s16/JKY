When I need a quick Mexican fix I run down the street on my lunch break to get 3 rolled tacos w/ guacamole & sour cream. & If I'm feeling famished I will get my favorite, carne asada fries no beans extra guacamole. I can never finish carne asada fries by myself though so I try to think with my head & not with my stomach.  

Location is very clean (unlike other locations). The staff is pretty quick to take orders and make food. Lines usually get long during my lunch but with the efficient and quick staff, the waiting isn't too bad.  

This isn't my favorite Mexican joint but defiantly will do the job when I'm at work and pressed on time!
