What a great find at Mandalay.
We went to Border Grill for lunch on a whim.  It is located near the convention center so a bit of a walk from the casino.
Border Grill overlooks the grand Mandalay pool, specifically the river part.  However, it is not too noisy and you can still have a good meal conversation.
The food choices are all Mexican.  We ordered the bean dip (delicious) and had a few plates of chips.  Yum!  
As for drinks, the margaritas were solid and they have a good selection of Mexican beers (my fave being Modelo Especial).
Service was very good.
I would definitely come back if in Vegas.
