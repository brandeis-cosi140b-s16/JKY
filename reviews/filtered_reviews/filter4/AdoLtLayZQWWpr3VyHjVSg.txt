What to say about one of my favorite drinking spots in town? One of the first times I visited Pittsburgh before I moved up, my current boyfriend took me by this location for some midday drinking. I was immediately in love. The big windows out front were open, letting in a nice breeze, it was sunny, and the bartender was very good. 

The restaurant was not very busy and the whole place had a very relaxed feel. Once I moved here, this became one of my go to spots to meet with people at - outside of the shitty parking, which isn't their fault. 

They have a good number of beer offerings, though the best part in my opinion is their selection of beers. The craft brews they offer are always on point. And my boyfriend loves their sangrias. He says they do one of the best in town.

Lest I forget about the food, I will say that I do enjoy it quite a bit. The carne enchilada with blue cornbread (ooooh, that blue cornbread) is my favorite on the list for sure. And make sure you ask for chips and salsa! Even if I go just for drinks I still end up with chips and salsa.

I don't have any complaints, like I said outside of the parking. During lunch time, it's a real bitch. If you can, grab a seat at the bar, forget the world for a few hours, and just chill out.
