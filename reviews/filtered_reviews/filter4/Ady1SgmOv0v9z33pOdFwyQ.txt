My family went to a late-night wedding rehearsal dinner here, served buffet-style. Our rather large party was seated on the patio. The kids had a blast, feeding the ducks and fish. While the pond was a bit... 'pond-y' smelling, I guess - it IS summer... it wasn't obnoxious and did not reach our tables. It was a very relaxing and inviting atmosphere. 

Chips and salsa were ok, as were the salad, and the small tastes I took of the enchiladas and tacos. The chicken & steak fajita meat were awesome. I had to break my low-carb resolve to have some of the pollo fundido, though, and was glad that I did. It was really, really good. Really good. 

Service was excellent. I've read the other reviews, where service is frequently panned. Our experience may have been better, since we had dedicated servers. They were on the ball, though. 

Good tourista place, and I hear they do a pretty nice breakfast. Not really sure I'd consider it romantic, but could be, for some people. I'd take the fam again, when we're up in that neck of the woods.
