The restaurant was across from our resort so why not!! OH YES!! The service was GREAT and the food was AMAZING. The salsa was fresh and delicious. Another great appetizer is the Mexican Street Corn. I also substituted my rice with the corn as one of my sides with my tacos. BEST CHOICE EVER!! The grilled fish tacos were SUPERB. The atmosphere was comfortable and relaxed.  I hope to get back in town during the fall or winter when the fire pits are lit on the patio. It looked like a great spot to have a good time with friends.
