I have been a fan of America's ever since I was introduced to it over a year ago.  I tend to eat vegetarian dishes most of the time, and can definitely say I've had my fair share of non-meat dishes with no flavor.  
The beans here are amazing (and lard free!), as is the guacamole.  The Trio is a great starter which includes chips, salsa, and guacamole. For the vegetarians the bean burrito (I add guac to it with a roasted jalapeno on the side), is quite tasty.  The menu item I look forward to the most (and sometimes go just for this item) is the America's corn.  Don't let the ingredients scare you away, just try it.  It's DELICIOUS!.  Sweet corn covered in mayo, cotija cheese, chili, and lime.  My boyfriend frowned at it the first few times I ate it in front of him, but once he gave it a chance he was hooked.  I crave these all the time!
I do have one complaint about America's, and that is the horchata.  The horchata had good flavor, but is REALLY grainy.  I think it would be a lot better if it was strained.  This has lead me to no longer order horchata from here which is unfortunate because it makes a great accompaniment to their main dishes.        
I have been to all three of their locations and each has an awesome patio great for enjoying a beer or margarita on a warm Phoenix day!
