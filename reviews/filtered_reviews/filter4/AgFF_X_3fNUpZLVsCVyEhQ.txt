I'll make this easy: 

1)  2 for 1 brunch margaritas..  KILLER margaritas - i.e., STRONG and just what I needed to kick my ass back into high gear while recovering from the night before. 

2)   I want to bathe in the guacamole!  No, marry it. No, bathe in it. Ok, both.  It's the perfect blend but I appreciate when a place doesn't over-complicate the guac and lets the avocado speak for itself.   

We had a few large groups (that didn't get seated together because we weren't all there at the same time) and the service was a little slow. I was drinking killer margaritas so I'm unable to recall whether that seemed to be from the kitchen, or from the wait staff.  Bottom line:  the margaritas made up for a bit of a long wait for chips!  

I had the huevos con chorizo which was interesting. I'm used to them all mashed together, but they had eggs mixed with potatoes (and maybe onions?) and the chorizo pretty much sprinkled on top.  Doesn't matter, all the flavors were there :)  And I liked the addition of potatoes.  

Did I tell you about the margaritas that would put hair on your chest??
