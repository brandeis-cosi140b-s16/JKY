Its very fresh, and its some tasty business. They focus on what they know, tacos, burritos, and quesadillas, no more, no less. No 200 items to choose from. Its a little tiny thing in a strip mall so dont expect stellar service. Focus on the flavor of the food and be done with it. Easy in, and easy out.

I ordered two items, the carne asada burrito and a carne asada taco. I definately think the carne asada is better than La Condesa I had a few weeks ago. I think the guacamole I got along with the burrito is good. But is it worth an extra $1? I dont think so...
