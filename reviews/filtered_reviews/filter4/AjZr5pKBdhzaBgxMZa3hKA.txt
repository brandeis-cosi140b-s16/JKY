My sisters came to town for a visit and we explored the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall (which is an adventure in itself) and came across this restaurant.  It was a Friday afternoon around 2 p.m. and there was no wait, which isn't surprising for the off time.  The hostess was extremely nice and we had a fun conversation on the way to the table.  

The catfish beignets and trio of dips were great appetizers!  If you can only pick one - go for the catfish!

The flank steak my sister ordered was pretty chewy and our least favorite of the things we ordered.  The flavor was excellent, but the chewy factor killed the idea of it.  

The southwest chicken that my other sister ordered was excellent.  Cooked perfectly and still juicy it was most definitely the better of the two meals.  

Service was great, the food was good (knocked just a touch for the chewy steak), and the atmosphere was festive.  It's a "must-try" for any visitor or local looking for a good meal.
