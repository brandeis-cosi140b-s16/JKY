I was not in a rush to check out Cabo because many of my friends have given it really bad reviews. However, since I was in the neighborhood around lunch-time, I decided to stop in and give them a try.  I was by myself, so I just sat at the bar.

On my visit, I was very fortunate because the service was good and they had my order ready super-quick. (Probably because the owner was in the kitchen as one of the bartenders told me).  In any case, I decided to order the Tavarua Wahoo Tacos ($10.50). This consisted of blackened wahoo in a kiwi-pineapple fajita sauce, with lettuce, tomato, cheese, & a honey wasabi sauce. 

The dish came with 2 tacos and your choice of a side dish.  The fish was perfectly cooked and had a nice balance of flavors. The tacos had a good amount of fish and tasted really good. I was a little worried that they might go overboard on the wasabi, but it was just the right amount.  For the side dish,  I went with the black beans & rice.  The side dish was ok, but the black beans could have used a little more seasoning. 

The chips on my visit were fresh & crispy.  The salsa seemed to be made in house and had a nice flavor but was mostly corn and could have used a little more tomato and a little more heat.  

Overall, I enjoyed my lunch and had good service, so I would definitely go back.
