Coming from DC, where the Mexican food is downright horrid, it was a real treat to eat at Taqueria Canonita. 

This is a casual Mexican place inside the Venetian hotel. We were seated "outside" under the Venetian's ceiling next to their version of the Grand Canal. It's a great place for people watching - you can see the gondolas row by and hear the gondoliers singing.

The focus is on food from Mexico City. The queso fundido appetizer was excellent, as was the Mexican sandwich (torta). The pitchers of margaritas are generous. 

The service was great and the waiter clearly adjusted when we made it clear we wanted to linger over our margaritas.
