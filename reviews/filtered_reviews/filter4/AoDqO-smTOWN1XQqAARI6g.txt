Wahoo's is fantastic. I used to frequent the  Costa Mesa and Laguna Beach locations when I lived in Orange County back in the 90s, so when the chain moved here I was elated. The food is just as great as it was then.  The burritos remain my favorites I items. Also the new bajaladas are great. I usually opt for black beans and white rice with extra poco de gallo. $2 Pacificos at happy hour seal the deal. Mmm.
