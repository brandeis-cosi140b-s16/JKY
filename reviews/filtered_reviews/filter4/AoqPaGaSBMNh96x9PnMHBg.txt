Great atmosphere and tasty food.  Happy hour until 7pm so that is a big plus.  We were well taken care of at a very busy bar.  In fact the bartender too the time to share some background one of her favorite tequilas in the inventory.

The Forteleza was a great recommendation and we also enjoyed our happy hour tacos, plus the chips and salsa.  Chips served piping hot.  We did sample the "bacon" guacamole.  Very fresh, but lacked a little kick or something...

This place was packed on a mid week afternoon.  Think it is well liked, so they must be doing something right.  

Keep up the good work!
