Decided to get tacos for some late night eats on the strip. Got carne asada, chicken, and carnitas. I wanted to get grilled fish too but they didn't serve it at the time I visited.  I felt brave and asked for habanero salsa on my taco. HOLY SH** it was so good but I was running around like a crazy person for a good minute...but I enjoyed it because it didnt have the usual a$$ taste from the pepper but had all the good components. I was able to use the yelp discount which was a plus.
