My wife and I keep coming back to this place for three reasons
1- the view, best in Henderson for looking at the entire valley
2- table side guacamole the best we have ever had
3- red sangria and margaritas, just don't let the manager make it, he tends to load it up with ice, and in the end you just get a watered down glass of wine
