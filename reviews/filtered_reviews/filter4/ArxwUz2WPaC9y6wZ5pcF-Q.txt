I found the staff really friendly, and the clientele too! It's a pretty long menu with reasonable prices. Great salsa; can't tell if they make their own chips though.. back in Queens you could tell by how greasy the chips where.

The decor is just this side of Salvation Army, which just adds to the charm for me. St. Patrick's Day was coming up and they had green decorations hanging from the ceiling, which was also amusing given the sombreros on the walls and the overall redness of the furnishings.

Try the albondingas soup. It's a spicy beef broth with two meatballs.
