I saw this place on The Food Network's Diners Driveins and Dives and it looked so amazing I had to put it on the list for my next Phoenix trip, and I wasn't disappointed. The host, Guy, seemed pretty smitten with this place, and I can't say I blame him.

The outside of the restaurant is covered with awesome graffiti style art, literary on all sides. The inside has a hip vibe to it and is broken into several small rooms with tables. We were seated right away on Saturday at lunch over a holiday weekend. Our server was with us quickly and was very nice and accommodating. He had no problem pointing out the couple things on the menu I should avoid, to stay away from da glutzen, but mostly everything else was gluten free. 

We ordered the guacamole which was amazing and the unexpected pomegranate seeds added a nice sweet yet tangy component. I had seen a couple of their especialidades de casa featured on the show and it was the tilapia that made me decide that this place needed to make the top of my nom list. The Mojarra San Augustin was amazing. A piece of seasoned tilapia on a bed of the family recipe achiote and wrapped in a banana leaf. It was perfect. My friend had the spinach salad with pecans and golden raisins. She loved the spicy yet sweet dressing but wished she'd had more options as a vegetarian. I'm not sure what my other friends ordered, they are regulars here and love it.

Overall, wish I was still in the Phoenix area so I could explore this menu more. It has a great atmosphere, food quality is excellent, price is reasonable and service was good. Definitely recommend trying it out, Guy wouldn't steer ya wrong.
