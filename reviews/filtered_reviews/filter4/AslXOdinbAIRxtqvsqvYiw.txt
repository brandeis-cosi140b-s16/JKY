My mom has had a huge hole in her heart since her beloved Viva Mercados shut down. In an act of desperation and pure genius, she phoned me and asked if I knew of a great Mexican restaurant in the area. It just so happened that I had bookmarked Juan's a few days earlier and deciding to to put my faith in my fellow Yelpers, we headed over... And once again, my Yelp compadres, you did NOT disappoint.

As soon as my mother and I opened the door we were greeted. This is a large space, with a separate bar and patio area (which pleases me because I don't have to sit near children - no offense to you parents out there). We were seated at a table and were greeted within 15 seconds. Needless to say, the serve was on point all night. My iced tea was never more than half full the entire night.

Chips and salsa and bean dip came out immediately, quickly followed by grilled peppers and onions.Then we got a cup of the sopa de fidello.  Being the avocado lover I am, I had to gets my guacamole on; Juan's make theirs table side with fresh cilantro, tomatoes, jalapenos, and onions. You really can't mess up guac, it was a total win. Fresh to death. 

My mother and I wanted to see what these Flamingo Fajitas were all about. We ordered the fajitas for 2 (priced around $23), steak and chicken combo. It came with a side of rice and beans, as well as more guac (there is no such thing as too much guac), pico de gallo, and sour cream. The fajitas came out, our server set the tray done and lite that bad boy on FIY-AH! It was awesome. The fajitas were then placed on the table and we devoured them. The meat was perfectly season as were the onions and peppers. DELICIOSO!!! Some of the best fajitas I've ever had. This entree actually served three and we had left overs.

We didn't have room for dessert so we skipped that. All in all, the hole in my mom's heart has been filled. Juan's delivered. Great food, great service. I am a fan. I cannot wait to go back and try their other entrees. Ole!
