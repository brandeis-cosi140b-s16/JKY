Came in and was quoted 20 minutes and we ended up waiting over 30 minutes. Chips and salsa are good. Chips aren't too salty and not too thin. Salsa was so good and delicious. I liked the little pieces of onions in it. Just so flavorful. I got the skirt steak tacos with flour tortilla and rice and corn. Tacos were good. Steak was good around medium and it was tender and juicy. Rice was good, not dry at all. Corn was delicious! That fresco sauce they put on there really gives it a kick. I would definitely go back.
