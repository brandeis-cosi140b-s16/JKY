I had the Enchiladas Suizas and a Michelada. My husband had the carne asada plate. My enchiladas where very Yummy! They should probably cut up the carne asada instead of serving a huge slab of it like a steak. Both plates were covered in chorizo which I love (so I can't be mad at them for that) but it kind of takes over all the other flavors. IMO if you want to add some chorizo flavor to your tacos that's what you order the queso fundido for. Over all it was probably the closest to authentic Mexican food I've had in AZ. That is the main reason I'd visit again. It was all over prized for sure. They were very busy but the service was good. I'll do taco Tuesday instead of dinner next time and maybe try a dessert.
