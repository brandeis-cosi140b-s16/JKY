Nice little hole in the wall mexican restaurant. I tried the mini chimi chico with machaca beef that was really good! The prices and portion sizes were decent. Everyone kept ordering the cheese crisp that showed up after us. A total of 11 orders of that in the time we sat there. Apparently it's to die for...too bad I had no room to have one myself. 
All in all the food and atmosphere was very good.

Will definitely come back and try the cheese crisp. :)
