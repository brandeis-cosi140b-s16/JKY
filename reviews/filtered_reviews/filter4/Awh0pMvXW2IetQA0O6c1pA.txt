Who'd a thunk it to find a great Mexican spot inside a gas station?? But it was pretty legit for where it was.  And the ONE guy working the place was very friendly, FAST, and made yummy grub!  Their salsa was very tasty and you could tell it wasn't the canned or bottled crap.  They had a pretty wide selection of food, very impressed!
