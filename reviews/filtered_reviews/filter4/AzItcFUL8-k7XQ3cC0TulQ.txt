I've been wanting to try this place but put it off due to some of the reviews . Well, I was dieing for chicken tacos and happened to drive by , so I stopped. And so glad I did! The service was excellent and the chips and homemade salsa... Best I've had in Phoenix . I started to get excited for my chicken taco lunch ! And it was amazing, authentic, delicious and everything homemade. The beans, oh my goodness , so delicious as was the Mexican rice. I noticed they have cheese stuffed jumbo shrimp wrapped in bacon on the menu. I'll be back later in the week to try those baby's. Give this place a shot! I'm so glad I did !!!!!
