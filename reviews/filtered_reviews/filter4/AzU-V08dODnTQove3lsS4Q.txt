I came here for lunch yesterday. I ordered the al pastor burrito. It was a first for me. It was good. It almost didn't happened because when we got there, they said they ran out of tortillas for the burritos, and just as I was about to order a bowl, someone said they have tortillas. It's a small place, and the back patio is a lot larger and of course they have musters running which is great. The server was friendly and brought out our meals. I was also curious about the tamarind juice they offer. I tried it but it was super sweet. 

I am not sure about this next part which I did not consider for my review, but I don't use my credit card often... And I used my credit card here. An hour later, I got a fraud protection alert saying there was a large purchase using my card! I suspect that someone skimmed my card while I was trying the tamarind juice. I cannot confirm or deny but just to be safe, I recommend bringing cash.
