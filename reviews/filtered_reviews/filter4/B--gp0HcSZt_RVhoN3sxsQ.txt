I rate Javier's Finest Foods of Mexico Restaurant 4 of 5 stars. Newly opened next to the casino floor in the Aria Hotel and Casino in City Center, Las Vegas, NV, Javier's is a beautiful facility. Mostly done in dark colors (black) with strategic lighting it is a comfortable place to dine. First impressions of any Mexican restaurant will be the salsa and chips--well after two full baskets of chips and two dishes of salsa, I can say that I approve of the salsa; in fact it is really good!

Javier's has a complex menu of choices including several house specials. Well, I'm a simple guy and ordered the Enchilada and Taco combination plate. Not your usual Taco Bell food! High quality food, well prepared and nicely presented. The taco was crisp and crunchy and tasted great. While higher priced than your local family joint, if you are in Vegas and looking for a great up-scale Mexican meal, I can highly recommend Javier's. In fact, on future visits to Aria, Javier's is on my list of things to do again. Oh, while you are in Javier's, make sure you get a close look at the back wall of all hand carved figures; a must see!
