Lol......well it hit 100 degrees and all the snowbirds are gone. So now i can go out to eat!! 
Good service.....water refills were on point 
Tacos were tastey along with great tasting free chips and salsa.
Had the beast burrito.......it was ok......refried beans in it....really?? 
For me ...,refried beans are the opposite of fresh mexican .

Made it out with a 25.00 bill for two, tip included.......by drinking water.
Alcohol has become a ridiculous waste of money and their beer , wine and drinks come at a premium. But....they do have happy hour prices.

If your going to eat and drink...expect  15.00- 20.00 + bucks a person .
Its the ultimate hipster hangout so expect music and hip people wearing hip clothing
To be buzzing around.
