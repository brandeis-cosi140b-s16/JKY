I am from Florida and was craving a good Mexican experience after not having a good experience the day before. I went on Yelp again to search for a good Mexican restaurant and this place came up. 
We ordered the house margarita, two fish tacos, and one chicken taco. The margaritas  were bigger than we expected (not that I'm complaining). The tacos were freshly made and well seasoned. The side items included were black beans over rice and coleslaw. Both were excellent and fresh. 
Our service was great overall. It took a few minutes to get our drink order but the waiter apologized for the wait and was very attentive after.
