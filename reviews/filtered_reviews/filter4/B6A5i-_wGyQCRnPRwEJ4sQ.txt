Ive been a regular at this location for some time now. No im not the regular that sits at the bar every day or goes to see the same waitress everyday they work. I go in, mind myself and just "spend time" hanging out.  Everyone is saying the service is bad here, the food is mediocre, the drinks are expensive, yada yada yada.  lets be honest people, the majority of people that work in a bar are young and trying to make ends meet. they are not professionals, but 9 out of 10 times they are doing the best they can. The food, well thats not the servers or bartenders fault.. I grew up working in a restaurant, don't take out your sub-par food on the server, I promise they didnt cook it. The drink prices, lets be honest, they are not high.  I have been to many bars where its $7 for a beer. If $4 is too much for a beer then you should stay home, pretty pennies don't pay the bills anymore.  Even when my friends go there they say that they are taken care of in a timely fashion and are anything but ignored, and they arent the easiest people to please. I've never been there at night, heard stories that its crazy busy, if thats your scene, go for it; i prefer late afternoons into the evening and even then its still a busy crowd. Place is a reasonable neighborhood hangout and offers more than any other bar near it.
