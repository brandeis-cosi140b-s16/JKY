I have been into this location a couple times and I will tell ya, it's always really good. The best deal is the chips and salsa. You don't think you will need it to be unlimited when you start, but that quickly changed when my group of ladies was on out FIFTH order. The medium salsa has a bit of a kick but the mild is SO GOOD!

I mixed my salsa in with the ranch dressing and then dipped my chips in that too. I know, I have a problem. A delicious problem though!

I've had their cheese enchiladas, which were tasty. Not the biggest fan of the rice. This last time, I had their bare wings with the rub and they literally fell off the bone! I think this may be my usual in the future.

I also dipped my wings in that salsa ranch too. Don't judge me. 

My only hang up has been the rice as well as the service. Neither waitress that we have had seemed to really be on her game. A lot of waiting.

Nonetheless, I don't have much going on in my life so if I have to wait a little while for my food or a refill, it's not a huge deal.
