Faustos let's me get the taco shop fix I miss from growing up in So Cal. Their service isn't the best but it's a taco shop...get over it. The best part about Faustos is their beans. The BEST I've had...and I'm a refried beans snob. The carne asada super nachos are pretty awesome too. Though I must say that rice in a California burrito is just wrong....where are the French fries Faustos?! Overall, blah service, excellent food, and great prices.
