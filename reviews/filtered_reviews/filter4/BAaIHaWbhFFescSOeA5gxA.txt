Cassie was one of the best servers ever.   The food arrived quickly and was soo tasty.   I shared the green corm tamales (a tad thick but huge and yummy) and the black and blue salad (fantastic steak salad).    Margaritas were good especially the house for only $6.00.   We are visiting this area but would go back again and again if we were locals just to try more of their dishes!
