So we went on a Monday when they had the 50% off locals deal.  Note it is 25% off now for locals.   Due to location and distance the discount definitely was enticing.  We started off with a pitcher of Margaritas.  It was a good size pitcher and they were decently strong .  The good thing was the non drinking wife is my built in designated driver.   
   For appetizers we had the Empanadas, Shrimp Cocktail and Shrimp Taquitos.  They were all very good.  The empanadas were as good as my former neighbor made for me every Christmas.  They use good shrimp which are fresh tasting and don't have the weird aftertaste you get from frozen shrimp sometimes.  That made they cocktail and taquitos really good.  We got a bowl of the Albondigas which was ok but not the best I have ever had.  
  We had shrimp tacos, Cilantro Garlic Shrimp and Carne Asada Plate for dinner - note there was 3 of us.  I am not that big of an eater.  The Shrimp Tacos and Garlic Shrimp was very good and really hit the spot.  The Carne Asada reminded me of a place in Rosarita I just loved.  The meat was well seasoned and so tender.  
   We finished off this mini foodie fest with the Tres Leches Cake and Leche Flan.  They were both amazing desserts.   A perfect ending to a very good meal.  Our server was Amber and she was incredible.  Despite the place being packed and Amber having several tables she made sure we were well taken care of.  
   They can get busy on Monday's so I made reservations of which I highly recommend.  They were turning people away the night we were there.  it is an odd location as they are not too far from the strip and also next to a Strip Club they share a parking lot with.  With the discount they were very reasonable.  Without the discount too expensive as they are no better than the nice Mexican places not near the strip.
