I love this place. I come to visit Las Vegas maybe once or twice a year, but I ALWAYS make sure I visit Casa Don Juan. The food is fantastic and the guacamole is amazing. The staff is friendly, albeit slow (hence the four stars), but the old man that always plays us guitar is adorable and they always treat us well. Some of the best Mexican food I've had!
