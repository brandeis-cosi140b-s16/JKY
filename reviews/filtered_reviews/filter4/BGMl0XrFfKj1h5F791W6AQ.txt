I don't know how many times I have driven past this place and never noticed it and that seems to be common place for this restaurant. It truly is a jewel staring you right in the face! Everyone I know LOVES Barrio..but the wait is pretty long on a regular basis. This place is just as good if not slightly better and NO wait. Last night I had the Lobster Thermidore Quesadiilas and they were fantastic! I would call the place cozy not cramped. Great date place. Truly a secret that is worth spreading.

P.S. 80s music was playing in the bar and you could hear it in the dining room but it wasn't overwhelming..just background..I noticed people were commenting on the music and their dislike of it. You dont go here to listen to the music..it's not a club after all or a live music venue. It's a bar/restaurant.. the music is inconsequential and should be viewed as the soundtrack to your life being played as you go about your business
