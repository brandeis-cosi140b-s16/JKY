Yum!  We stopped in this weekend for lunch after reading the rave reviews and were not disappointed.  We grabbed a table out front and brought our furry friend.  We enjoyed the grilled chicken and carne asada burritos.  Both were fresh, flavorful and quite big.  Everything was freshly made and you could tell as there was no oil or grease.  Definitely worth the visit!
