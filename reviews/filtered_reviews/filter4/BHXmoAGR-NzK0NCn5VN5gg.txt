Met up with some college girlfriends to drink, eat, and reminisce last night. This was a great place to do so. The service was great and the food was even better. We started the the chips/salsa, guac, and cheese dip. The quantities of the dips are big, in my opinion. Very fresh and yummy. 

The friend sitting next to me got the red chicken chili chopped salad which she raved about and cleaned her plate! I got the chicken taquitos from the appetizer menu which were very tasty and the perfect portion for me..I'm "that" friend that will eat an entire basket of chips and be full! 

In terms of drinks we tried the pear margarita, which was really yummy. The pomegranate margarita I wouldn't recommend. 

Basically, I would recommend this place to anyone passing through Charlotte. Good atmosphere, good food, great place to catch up with friends!
