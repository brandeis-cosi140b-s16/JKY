Its tough, as a resident of this area, to support a corporate chain coming into the neighborhood, but Z Tejas is a welcome addition.  The bar area design is very cool, but the dining room decor is very lack luster - who sits in dining rooms anymore?  The service is always fantastic, even at peak times!
