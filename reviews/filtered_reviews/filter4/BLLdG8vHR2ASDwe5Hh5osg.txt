I've only had the Street Tacos here, and they are A1! The tortilla shells are fresh and sturdy. The meat melts in your mouth and is well seasoned. I've had the carnitas, asada, pollo and tinga -soooooo good. The horchata is tasty as well. 
They top the the street tacos off with chopped red onions and cilantro. I'm not crazy about the amount of red onion that goes on here -it's alot. Especially when compared to the cilantro -very little. 
The ambiance is relaxed and the decor is very nice. Service is also great. 
Can't wait to try more of the menu!
