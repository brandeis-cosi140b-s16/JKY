I saw lobster floutas on the menu and knew this was the place for me!
Unfortunately, my appetite didn't cooperate and I only had room for an entree. The seafood enchiladas were good, but lacked seasoning. There was plenty of fish and less shrimp, but both needed some flavor. I dumped the salsa from our chips 'n salsa on the enchiladas to add that flavor. I also asked for some hot salsa and got a fruit based hot salsa which was very good. The rice was not the traditional Mexican rice I'm used to, it was white rice and was probably better. 

I liked the ambiance of the bar/dining room where we ate. They have cool globe lights on the ceiling and the backdrop of the bar is very inviting. I had a prickly pear margarita which I think is hard to find around here and it was very good!
