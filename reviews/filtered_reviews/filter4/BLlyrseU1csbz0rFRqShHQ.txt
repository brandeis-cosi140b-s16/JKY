This is really Americanized, tex-mex style food but it's really good, nonetheless.  I stopped in with two friends on a Saturday night and had a few minute wait, so we grabbed drinks at the bar.  I ordered the sangria margarita which was delicious, strong, and priced well at $6.99.  I would definitely go back for more of those yummy drinks!  A few minutes after sitting down, our table was ready.  I had the taco salad clasico with chicken.  It was very tasty, loved the tender shredded chicken in the salad.  Service was decent and the food was very good!  I would definitely return to Emiliano's!
