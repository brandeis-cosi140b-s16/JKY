The Mission boasts a super charming old world vibe with it's ornate interior and a fabulous patio with a fireplace, which I got to enjoy on a dinner outing with fellow co-workers. We weren't your typical 6-8 top, rather 20 plus! We took over a good portion of the patio and several tables, but it was still intimate and cozy. Our prefix menu included pork belly lettuce cups, kale salad and tacos (beef, pork and chicken). The lettuce cups were a nice way to start off the meal. The salad was good, but my serving was heavy on the cheese (cream cheese? or a super mild goat), while I love love Kale, I was distracted by the clumps of cheese on my plate. The tacos delivered on flavor, yet were teeny tiny! My favorite was the beef. I found the pork a little sweet for my taste, but all were flavorful as can be! We had what seemed to be bottomless chips, salsa, guacamole and delicious margaritas! I can't fail to mention the shot of tequila with a cinnamon rim and a slice of orange. What a pairing! Something I'd never had before. I love tequila and I loved that shot. The servers made sure to keep the food and drinks flowing all evening. All in all it was a fine time and a fun meal.
