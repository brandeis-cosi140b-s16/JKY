I've been eating here for about 20 years.  The best green chile burrito I've ever had!   Their breakfast burritos are very good as well.  My only knocks  are the extra charge for to-go salsa (it's really good salsa though) and occasional slow service.  Other than the charge for extra to-go salsa,  prices here are great.
