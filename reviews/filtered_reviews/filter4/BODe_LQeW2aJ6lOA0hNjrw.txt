Wow ! Stumbled across this place and so glad I did ! So so good , service is friendly . He asked if this was our 1st time and offered samples ! Food arrived and to our surprise you even get a free cookie . Food was DELISH ! Jerk rice was amazing , quesadilla with Machaca meat is the way to go ;) and to top it off with a cherry on top I found out this is one of the spots Guy  Fieri stopped at on his show..(I had no clue and I love him) .  We will def be back !!
