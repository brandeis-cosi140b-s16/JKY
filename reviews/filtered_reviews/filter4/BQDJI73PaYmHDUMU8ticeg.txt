Mexican food is a weakness of mine, especially since I'm supposed to et right for my blood type. However occasionally I will splurge and this is where I go! 

Now the food is always excellent and I enjoy the atmosphere and even though the prices are still higher than I think they should be its a good stop to fulfill the craving. 

I recently went to eat here with my husband,friend and little boy. The food came out hot and quick and they didn't miss a beat with filling our drinks. So they have great service. The only thing i wasn't found of is that the music was soooooo loud I couldn't hear my friend across the table. But that's really an observation rather than a complaint! 

I will I back again and bring friends.
