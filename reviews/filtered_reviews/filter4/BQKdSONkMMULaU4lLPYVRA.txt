You can always count on the HRH to rock some great drink specials and Pink Taco's HH keeps that trend alive. There are a number of beers, margaritas, sangria, shots and other decent (Jack) well drinks available for $5 and a few foodstuffs for $5-9. Running from 3-7pm M-F, there's sufficient time to get tequila crazy in this joint. Even with the cold(er) weather outside and the large doors that lead to the pool closed, the vibe is still fun and will lead to an extended session of getting sauced. 

From the menu, I tasted the honey-chipotle wings (a nice sweet glaze with smokey ranch. Make sure you tell them to cook the wings to a crispy well done), the Diablo nachos (not as spicy as you would expect, but still good) and some guacamole (solid). Sure, you can't really go wrong with these orders, but they were perfect for the occasion.  

All in all, my party of three stayed for 2+ hours and left full (and dirty drunk) for $150 including tax and tip. Not a bad outing.
