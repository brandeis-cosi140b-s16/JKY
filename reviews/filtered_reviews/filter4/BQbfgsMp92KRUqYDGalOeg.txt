Great food at a good price. My 2 friends and I tried a variety of dishes. I sampled them all. The Chinese was the best. The Mexican was good though the breading on the Chili Relleno was much to thick and covered up the taste of the Chili and the Cheese.
It a great place to take your family when they can't decide on what to eat.
At $7.50 for a combo plate you can't go wrong.
Yes it's an odd combo but it works to satisfy your cravings.
