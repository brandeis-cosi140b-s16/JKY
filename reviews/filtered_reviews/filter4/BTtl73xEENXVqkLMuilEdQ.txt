I like Mexican food and this place did not disappoint! My family and I were in Phoenix for only a few hours and my husband's cousin suggested coming here for dinner. The outside wall art was an added bonus. Best dinner suggestion ever! Although there was not a 'kid's menu' and hardly any food to choose from, we were able to get my daughter a few corn tortillas and chicken to make her own version. Problem solved. Our meals were fantastic and the sangria was the best I'd ever had!
