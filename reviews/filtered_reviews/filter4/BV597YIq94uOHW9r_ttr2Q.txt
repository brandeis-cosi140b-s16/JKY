My brother recommended that I try this place and I was a little skeptical based on the website alone. I thought it was a club or something. I went anyway and was soooo glad I did. The food is so damn good. I still think about it all the time! LOL! Why not 5 stars? It's so loud in there that you have to scream to have a conversation. It's a great place to watch the game and to hang out. Perhaps the outside seating area is a little quieter. Definitely give this place a try; you won't be disappointed.
