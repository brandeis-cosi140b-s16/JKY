One of those things where you wish "yelp" has 1/2 stars! The food is AMAZING, the ambiance is an A+!!! 
BUT... it happened twice now, DO NOT DRINK THE WATER! My girlfriends and I got very sick the first two times we were there. 
The server and the host are the most important when going into the restaurant. Because you don't to walk in feeling like Casper! They were so welcoming and very friendly!
