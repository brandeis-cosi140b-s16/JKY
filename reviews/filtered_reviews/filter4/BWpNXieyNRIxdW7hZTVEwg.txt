1st..downtown Mesa needs to get its props. They have some really good places to check out and Mango's is one of them.  Mangos is one of my favorite Mexican food stops. I love their taco salads because their tacos are homemade and soooo delish. 

I also love their 100% fruit juices, so simple and so good. You gotta get there before the lunch crowd if you want some though, they run out super fast. 

Simple, Delish, and fun.  Oh....and here's a lil inside hint, going to the bathroom there is an adventure on its own....
