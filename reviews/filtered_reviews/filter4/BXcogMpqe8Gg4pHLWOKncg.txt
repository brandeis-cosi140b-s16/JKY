I liked this place. Great Atmosphere and music. Their Guacamole and Salsa is really good. Service was good too, My server (forgot his name) came by often to check on me (Or because he thought I was gonna run out on the bill) and was really nice. I had the Carne flatbread, surprisingly good! Id definitely come back when I have have the money

Good place for a date as well!
