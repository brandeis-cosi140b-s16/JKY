I still call this place "Sylvia's" from its original name "Sylvia's La Canasta."

Food here is legit. And they have a fully stacked salsa and chip bar to hold you over until your food is ready. The seating area is comfortable and ample, stretching out into the shaded patio looking onto seventh ave. 

The area is nothing to worry about. There are a couple of pockets near there that aren't the best but I wouldn't let it affect my decision to go there or not. . .

When this place opened, it was a small corner store with a few regulars and a growing number of true believers. After a few years, its popularity began to soar so they expanded the restaurant and grew the seating areas. 

What can I say? I'm a softie for bootstraps success stories like this one. 

Food is delicious, authentic and cheap. I highly recommend swinging by for a daily lunch special, but the service and food are worth the trip around the clock.
