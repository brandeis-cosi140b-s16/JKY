Love the Tacos very cheap and a great variety. 

Didn't like the fact that they charged $1.95 for Salsa and chips. The chips were good but you received less than a handful, just not a good portion for an appetizer.

I had the Dando, The crunchy taco, bean and cheese, and the chicken Asada.
The Charro beans were too salty, but the Mexican rice was on FLEEK! Lol
