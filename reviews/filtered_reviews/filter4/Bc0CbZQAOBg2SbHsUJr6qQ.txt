I really like this place and have been here eons apart on a few occasions, most recently this past weekend. The staff is friendly and quick. The food is delish, with just the right portions (big but not insanely huge) The blue margarita was good if a bit sour. I am usually not one to eat chips and salsa, but theirs is really good and I devoured it all. The restroom was clean and tidy.
