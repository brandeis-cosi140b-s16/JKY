Great food and great atmosphere! I had the Blackened Chicken and Avocado salad which was good. Not totally original but still great. Hubby had the Sante Fe Stuffed chicken breast and said it was pretty good. We had the tres leches for dessert which was delicious. Friendly staff and clean restaurant!
