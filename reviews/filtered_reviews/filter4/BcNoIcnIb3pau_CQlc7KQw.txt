Came here upon my cousins recommendation. Glad we did. We sat outside on the patio because it was unbearably cold inside. The chips and salsa were different than ive ever had: crispy, good spice with a hint of sweetness. A raspberry margarita hit the spot. I ordered a chicken salad, lots of breast meat chicken, and a delicious salad dressing. Great service, just watch out for the birds they are ready to EAT too!! When in town i'd come back here.
