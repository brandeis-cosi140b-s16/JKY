Awesome taco and salsa choices, but no big crowds.

For a foodie, it's great there are no long lines and waits for seating, but peoples, YOU'RE MISSIN' OUT! In Saturday for lunch, had a seat at the empty bar. Tables mostly full, but not jammed with folks. Good for me though, service was quick, and room to kick back.

Ordered Azteca Tinga and Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken tacos, but oddly, was served Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco instead of the Azteca. I double-checked with the server 'cuz the Cochinita was absolutely mouth-watering! Over-the-top when paired with the Cilantro salsa (just a touch). A definite repeat item. Black Mole was certainly delivered as described, with dark, somewhat smokey-molasses flavor, but a bit too heavy for me.

Ti[p: Pick just two-to-three salsa to sample, and then decide on how best to enjoy them-some just with chips, others to top off a taco. How to be sure what's best? Duh, come back again!
