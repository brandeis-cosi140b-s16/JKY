Came out here on a Saturday afternoon to grab some drinks. When we walked in, the place was packed with Iowa fans. Didn't expect Arizona to have such a huge Iowa following so I kinda chuckled. It was a good atmosphere though, a sea of black and yellow with everyone having a good time. 

We sat inside because the outside was packed. Ended up ordering the Mini Chimis along with some Crown and Cokes. Great spot overall, with plenty of screens to watch the game and great service.
