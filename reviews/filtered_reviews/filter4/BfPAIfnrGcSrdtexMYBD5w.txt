Best tortillas in the valley, food is fantastic. Ignore the haters here, try this place.

It's true that the presentation isn't chef quality, but it's not expected to be.

The portions may not be to your liking, and if that's the case you are most likely morbidly obese and need to control your appetite before you have a cardiac arrest.

If your thoughts are that "there isn't much flavor" then go eat Top Ramen or something because you don't know Mexican food.

This place is exactly what Mexican food is meant to be. Simple, spicy, filling and HOT. The folks behind the counter are pleasant, the operation is efficient and the food is really good.
