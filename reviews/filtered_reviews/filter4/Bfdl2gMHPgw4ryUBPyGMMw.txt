So appropriate that James Taylor's "Mexico" came on while I was dining here.  The lyrics include the line "I've never really been but I'd so like to go... guess I'll have to go now."  There is something about the pseudo-Latin instruments and the added vocal harmonies of Crosby and Nash that makes one want to go to Mexico after listening to this ridiculously catchy song.

Pretty much sums up how I feel about this place...Mexican-American fast food fare that despite it's pseudo-authenticity, is still ridiculously tasty.  When faced with the rival options like Chipotle and Taco Bell, Cafe Rio wins hands down every time!  Freshly made tortillas cranked out on the premises, daily specials like coconut shrimp tacos and tamales, and a badass oven that takes shredded cheese sprinkled on top of a variety of dishes and transforms it into a velvety gooey blanket of melted cheese-liciousness in less than a minute, the portions are generous and one can even partake in agua frescas and horchata for beverage options.  Service is fast and the ingredients are fresh (saw a whole army of chicken breasts fired on the grill and one of their napkins claimed they squeeze over 1000 limes daily).  

While I am still on a quest to search for the most tasty authentic joint that teleports me directly to Mexico, this will still be my guilty pleasure place for fast food that makes me want to go to Mexico, much like James Taylor.
