Enjoyed my first visit to Padre's during lunch this afternoon. Seems like it would be a great happy hour spot since the bar is pretty cool. Overall the place is pretty small and not much going on, but they serve great food. The staff was great, good suggestions and personality from both the waiter and waitress that helped us. I ordered a beef burrito with red sauce -- perfect amount of kick. Like most Mexican places, the lunch portions were too big. I couldn't come close to finishing and really needed a recliner after. I'll definitely go back when I'm downtown...
