The seafood soup shrinked!
Food and service were OK, our server did not take good care of our refills, but other than that  it was good. Chips and salsa are good, and so is the bean dip, although they seem to have changed the bean dip a few times and we liked the very old recipe better.

Back to my soup, I have had the Siete Mares soup a few times and it was always overflowing from the bowl, with big pieces of crab legs. Well, this time I got like 1/4 of a crab leg and the contents of the soup were not as generous :(
