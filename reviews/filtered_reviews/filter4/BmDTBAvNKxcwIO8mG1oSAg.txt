I have been going to this restaurant for 15 years and love the authentic Mexican taco taste. My go-to is a tortilla with butter and a pork/beef mix quesadilla. The pork is sweet and with some hot salsa is the best flavor combo. No rice and beans included and they do charge for using a card so bring cash. 

Salsa bar included!
