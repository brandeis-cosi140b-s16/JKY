Loved the location of the restaurant. It was a little hectic and confusing trying to figure out how to get a seat or even where the bar part of the restarant was. Be wary if seated outside as bugs may actively fly near you as do the birds if trash left by other customers is not picked up soon enough. Otherwise, service was friendly and I would deff reconmend this place for families. The chips and salsa were delicious, as were the margaritas. From what I experienced the food was not spicy at all, but still good. It seemed a little pricey for what you ordered but still nice
