We were in Phoenix over the weekend for a swim meet and we came here on a recommendation from another family on a different team.  We had a large table and everyone left happy and full!  First, the chips and salsa were delish!  Our meals were top notch! Best Chili Relleno I have EVER had!  Then the kids found the chocolate fountain, Oh my!   The chef came out and gave us a history of the restaurant.  We had alot of fun and enjoyed our meal.  We highly recommend Aunt Chilada's. Cant wait to be in the area again for another swim meet! We will be back!
