Oh a regular at another Wahoos? Who'd ever guess that of me? Well needless to say, if there is a Wahoo's near me, I will sniff it out and eat there. This is the second of three Wahoos found in Clark County, all just slightly not as good as the originals in California but respectfully do take care of my fish taco cravings. 

This location I actually prefer over the one off of Rainbow. Its a little brighter and the food is presented much nicer than the other one. One thing I can get on them about is that there are way too many people at the bar at 11 am. I mean really? Starting early much? Also the people at the front should pay a little more attention to the people willing to order instead of worrying about talking to the customers who are drinking.
