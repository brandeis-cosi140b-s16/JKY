Ended up here after going to the location on Bell Rd and there was a 45 min wait... on a Tuesday! Yes, it was Senior Night, but that was surprising to me. Maybe everyone is in town for Thanksgiving? Or for the winter (snowbirds)? The wait at Cave Creek ended up being about 20 min. Not bad. The food was pretty consistent with our regular location. The chips were a little oilier than I'm used to, but the chicken chimi (no guac or garnish), rice, and beans were very tasty. In fact, I think the rice was not as dry as the Bell location has been. Got to use our buy one, get one free coupon. I still wish there was a Valle Luna in the west valley! Once a month we drive 24 miles each way to eat at Valle Luna. Would love to have an Avondale/Goodyear location!
