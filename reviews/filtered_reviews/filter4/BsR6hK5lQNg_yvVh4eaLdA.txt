I don't know what's going on with the negative reviews-- I've been here twice and enjoyed it both times. 

The first time I was here with a bunch of friends for a birthday party. I ordered some sort of creamed chicken dish, which came out after a reasonable time and was pretty good. I don't know how authentic that is but it was tasty and that's all I cared about. The hot bean dip with the authentic chips is a definite plus, as is the home made spicy guacamole. The beans and rice are your standard mexican restaurant fare-- no complaints.

The second time I came here with my girlfriend. I ordered the steak colorado and she ordered the steak fajitas. I tasted both the entrees and thought it was pretty good stuff. The staff was very friendly, the view was beautiful, the prices were decent. What more can you ask for? Great place for a date!
