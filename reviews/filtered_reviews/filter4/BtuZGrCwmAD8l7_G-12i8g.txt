We are from out of town and trying to find a Mexican restaurant a friend recommended on Mayo just to discover it was shut down. Bummer because now we were craving Mexican food. Pulled up Yelp on phn which led us here and we were not disappointed! The server was lovely and attentive and recommended the Baja Enchiladas (shrimp filled enchiladas with a yummy chipotles sauce) and they did not disappoint, simply delicious! My husband also loved his dinner (Baja Platter)!
