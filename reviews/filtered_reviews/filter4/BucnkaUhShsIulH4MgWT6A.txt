My husband and I just moved here from Chicago and we've have Mexican food every Saturday for the last 2 years.  Needless to say, we've been on the hunt for the best Mexican restaurant here in the Phoenix area since we moved here 2 months ago.  Our criteria is simple:  (1) Margaritas, (2) chips and salsa, and (3) food and fajitas.

(1) Margaritas --  Thumbs up!  So far Aunt Chiladas has the best Margaritas I've had in the valley and we've been to quite a few places including Tee Pee (where the food is good but the Margaritas suck).  We ordered the hand shaken margarita and its a pretty big serving with lots of the good stuff in it...

(2)  Chips and Salsa -   Thumbs up!  The chips are unusual in that they are flour not corn and come out nice and hot.  We liked the salsas and I love black olives so the fact it was in the salsa was a big yum factor for me.

(3)  Food/Fajitas - Thumbs up!  We ordered a few different things including the Chingalingas (yum!), steak fajitas, and enchiladas.  We also really liked that they give noodles (fideos) with refried beans instead of rice.  Those are awesome.  The steak fajitas were the bomb

The only downside is the service is just way too slow.  I mean, we waited and waited and waited.  They were nice enough but bring a pillow because it'll be a while!!
