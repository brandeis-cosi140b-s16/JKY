After reading all the reviews on Yelp we decided to try this place. It's super cute with nice decor. They had a live Dj playing while enjoying our tacos. I tried the cabeza taco & the chicharrón con salsa verde. The chicharrón taco was my favorite. Super tasty. The adobada tacos were pretty good too. I'm only giving them 4 stars because we are from San Diego & tacos do not compare to our Tj tacos but they were tasty. You walk up and order from different stations similar to Tacos El Gordo in SD. Give this place a try if your in the neighborhood. Staff is friendly. My advice would be to order fast because the tacos get cold quick.
