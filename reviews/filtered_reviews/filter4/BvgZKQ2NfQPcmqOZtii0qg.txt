This joint is located in The Saguaro hotel.  I stayed at the hotel for a week on a business trip.  I ate lunch and dinner a few times with clients.  Districto's menu is designed by world famous Chef Jose Garces.   I must admit that I never heard of Chef Jose Garces, but apparently he has a bunch of chain restaurants.....

Districto's staff is outstanding.  They go the extra step to make sure everything is perfect.  The manager is doing groupon's (I did not have one, but I heard some other guests using it) and Yelp check in free guacamole!!!!!    Kudo's for bonus!

Lunch - $15 Two Course Special.   Guacamole is to die for, 5+ Star.  Pescado fish taco was suberb.

Dinner - Sweet corn soup, mmmmm...  Ceviche de Kampachi was okay.

Happy Hour!!!!!  Yes!  $5 margarita.  Taste 5+ star, alcohol -5 star.  I had two and they were consistent with little alchol.  I like a stout drink, just my preference.  

Note- Every night, the joint was full of local people as well as hotel people, this is always a good sign that the ambieance is top notch.  Each night, they brought in different live music.  Sitting on the patio, getting my groove on, happy hour and free (Yelp check in) guac and Scottsdales perfect weather is awesome!!!!!!!!!!

Why 4 star??????  Overall the food is just not my cup of tea.  Chef Jose Garces, while I am sure that some people rave about it, I am more traditional hispanic dishes.  This food was just do artsy fartsy, hard to explain, some people like presentation and the high end food, I just like normal food.  The server said that the food is "a little different" when I asked what the heck all the stuff is with each item.....  Crap hard to explain, just my taste......
