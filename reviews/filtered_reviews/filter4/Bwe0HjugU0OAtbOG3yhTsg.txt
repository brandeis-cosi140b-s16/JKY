We decided to have dinner here because the prices and reviews were great. They did not disappoint! We had some of the best vegetarian tacos ever! It's a little off the strip, near UNLV and totally worth the time to find. The manager even came over and told us about a poetry slam they were going to have and some live music events. it's a very casual place with great food! I would definitely go back.
