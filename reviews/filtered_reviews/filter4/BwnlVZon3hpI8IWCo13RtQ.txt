Definitely a Fan of this place! Came here Saturday night. Saw a gentleman out on the strip giving out wristbands for free admission. We were across the street from the place. The line was Long. We definitely did not want to stand in line after trying to get into Hakkasan at the MGM. I told the guy we will go to Diablo if we don't have to stay in line. He said he will get us in just have to ask his manager. He got us in no waiting in line. Super cool! There was people still eating downstairs. We made our way up to the roof top. There as a live band. Can i say they were awesome! We danced to all the songs they performed to. Then they had to go. Told everyone there will be a Dj downstairs. We went downstairs took off our high heels and hid under one of the Reserved booths. hehehe We danced the night away. Crowd was very diverse and music was great. I hate techno music this place know what to play to get the crowd dancing. A lot of hip hop!!
