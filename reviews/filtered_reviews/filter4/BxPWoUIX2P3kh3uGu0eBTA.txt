We were visiting relatives over Thanksgiving 2010 and staying down the street at the Pointe Hilton.  We're Triple D junkies and look for places Guy has reviewed when we're vacationing.  This is a small strip mall location that is bright, clean and friendly.  The food was very enjoyable, well seasoned, without a lot of frill and reasonably priced.  The salsas were great with good heat.  The carne asada street tacos were perfect and the cheese enchilada was soft, cheesy and tangy.  A couple cold cerveza and flan for dessert, and the bill was around $20.  Will definitely go back next time we're in Phoenix.
