I thought I didn't like Macayo's. Typically, I'm not a fan of chain restaurants, and because of the heavy Hispanic/Chicano population in the Southwest, we have a multitude of Mexican restaurants to choose from.

But it was good. I went with a group of friends recently. I monkey see-monkey do-'ed and ordered what my friend ordered. The cheese enchilada was tasty, and the beef tamale with baja sauce. Oh yes. Das ist gut. I mean, muy bien. 

I went again a little over a month ago with a dear friend during lunch, and it was even better than the last time. We were cozied in a booth in the back, with a darling older blonde lady as our waitress. She was chatty and pleasant. My friend ordered a margarita in one of the fancy mugs for him to take back to Utah. I ordered a conconutty margarita, which was mighty tasty with lots of coconut on the rim and in the drink, as well as a hefty chunk of pineapple inside, as well. Excellent!

The waitress was attentive but respected our space. The chips and salsa were uber fresh. They were so good, I could have come just for chips and salsa + a margarita. The food came very quickly, piping hot and the presentation was just so. Our lovely lady loaded us up with napkins (not gonna lie, I am a napkin hog), and we got to it. I ordered the tamale with baja sauce, and it was heavenly. We took our time to eat and sat in the booth with our food babies for awhile after we finished. The food was great and it was a nice experience. Looks like I need to chill on my chain restaurant snobbery, because I'll definitely be back.
