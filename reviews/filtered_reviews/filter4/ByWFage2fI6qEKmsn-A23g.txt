Ya know what makes a great meal? A great server! Our party of 3 was new to this "Gourmet Mexican Food" location, so we had questions. Plus, we knew we wanted antojitos, platos de carne, y postres........we needed the option to SHARE so many plates :() Our server, Durango, made it happen! He was ready with all the answers, was alerted to and wary of my peanut allergy, and set up all plates to share effortlessly....platters, large plates, side plates....perfect!
To be fair, if the food hadn't been good, I probably would have written about the service anyway. But, the food was fabulous, so double score!! We had chili con queso, chicken enchiladas, machaca tacos, and then there was dessert........a warm, almost on the under-baked-side-which-is-so-sinful-walnut-brownie that was served with vanilla ice cream and Mexican brandy butter sauce. Delish & delightful - a great find while on our mini vacation in Scottsdale!
