Finally!!! I made it!!! I went in with Spicy Pastor Tacos on my mind. But when I saw an order of Carne Asada Fries pass by me, I changed course. I got the small order and glad I did because the large would have been way too much.

Let me tell you, TEG is some straight up Mexican food goodness! I love this place. The lines were crazy, it was hot in there, families squished in together at the small tables, people hollering across each other - I loved it! And I will be back now that I know where it is. For the past three trips to Vegas, I would make the effort to get to TEG, but could never "see" it.  It is in a sort of strip mall with a small parking lot.  This time, I rode around twice before I spotted it.  And I was rewarded with some really good eats.  (This review was from my July 2013 trip)
