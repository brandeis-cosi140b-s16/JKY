Brisket tacos - not to be missed. El Dorado Margarita is fresh and tasty. The only downside to Paco's is that it's pricey. It's worth it once in a while, but can't be an every week kind of a place. It's hard to find - behind Williams Sonoma in the shopping center across from South Park Mall. LOVE this place - feels like Austin, TX at a tacky BBQ joint but has great mexican food.
