Let me start with the view, it is SPECTACULAR.  it is the best view of the valley in the city.  Ask for a table on the lower level if they have one available. You won't regret it.  

The food is always good and there is plenty of it.  Two of our favorites are the red snapper and the chili verde.  The red snapper is flash fried and available with a variety of sauces.  The chili verde is tender and well seasoned. 

The chips are fresh and crispy.  The salsa is spicy and just darn good.  Whenever we have friends in town this is a must visit for us.
