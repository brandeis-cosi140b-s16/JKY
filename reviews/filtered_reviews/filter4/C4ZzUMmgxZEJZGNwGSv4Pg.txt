This location is nothing like the 35th Ave and Bell location, thank God! I ordered the carne asada tacos, one chicken, one steak. Oh my were they fabulous. Both meats were cooked perfectly tender and seasoned. Tortillas were fresh and soft. Beans and rice were a great side, as they each had good flavor. The chips and salsa here are addictive and yummy. Very fresh and flavorful. Service was good and it was extremely busy so brownie points.
