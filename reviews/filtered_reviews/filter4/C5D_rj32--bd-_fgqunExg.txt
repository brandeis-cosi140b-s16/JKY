When you're drunk off your ass from XS nightclub at Encore and the line for taxis is like a mile long, you want to walk over a block here to Tacos El Gordo. Big restaurants with plenty of seating and $2 tacos! Yup, not ALL food joints in Vegas will burn a hole in your wallet. 

My foodie friend took me here after XS last weekend along with a group of my girlfriends. He took good care of us and ordered here about 20 Taco De Adobada. It was delicious! And I was sober by then so I can vouch it's also good without the intoxication. :) It had a green sauce and plenty of meat. Worth every $2 my friend paid.  You really just have to come here and try it out. Though there were a lot of club goers at the time we went, the line moved ridiculously fast because service was quick. We sat outside in the patio. Tables inside are along the walls of the restaurant. 

The only thing is, don't expect to get a taxi from here. It's impossible!
