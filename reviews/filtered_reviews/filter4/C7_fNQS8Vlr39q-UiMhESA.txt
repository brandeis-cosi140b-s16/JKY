I highly recommend Habanero's! They have great guacamole and AWESOME pork tacos. For the price, it can't be beat. Their salsa is bland. And the waiters/waitresses came over every 5 minutes to check up on us. Which was really annoying, but it turned comical. I'm pretty sure they weren't communicating with one another about how often service was stoping by our table. Oh well, I'd rather have eager service than lazy service. My husband got fajitas and the chicken was marinated beautifully. For the value, this place is a home run.
