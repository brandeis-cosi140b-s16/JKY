Lately I've been craving the chicken machaca burritos at Revo. My husband and I love this place. It's a slightly healthier version of really great mexican food. We love the hip vibe and location at 32nd St & Camelback. The prices aren't bad and the menu is complete. Try the creamy rice side dish - delish. My husband swears by the carne asada. They also have a variety of house-made lemonades. One is even made with stevia for those cutting back on sugar. My six year old boy loved it. We'll be back!
