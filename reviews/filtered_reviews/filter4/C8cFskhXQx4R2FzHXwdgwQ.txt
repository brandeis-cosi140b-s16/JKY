I called ahead and ordered a #10 (ground beef burrito smothered in hatch chile sauce with rice and beans) to go. When I arrived, the place was packed, especially for a random (otherwise empty at that time) strip mall location on a Wednesday night. I waited about 10 minutes in line as the guy in front of me ordered what seemed like half of the menu. There is only one cashier for a whole lot of volume coming through those doors. My delicious meal came with complimentary chips and salsa (choice of hot or mild). The hot was HOT, but deliciously addicting. 

I will be back to try more of their delicious food, but only when I have the patience for lines and crowds (which I usually don't if I am ordering something to go in the first place).
