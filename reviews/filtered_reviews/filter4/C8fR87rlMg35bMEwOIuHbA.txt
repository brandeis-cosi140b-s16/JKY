I ordered the steak, chicken, and chorizo tacos. Overall, they were simple, authentic, and fresh; it is comparable to Southern California Mexican tacos. The corn tortillas were a bit dry (I may have gotten some old ones), and there were two per taco (which I think is excessive). As for the meats, the steak could be more rare (mine were well done), but was seasoned nicely. The chicken was tender, but could use a little more salt. The chorizo was quite spicy and overpowers all the other meats. I would recommend eating it last to fully taste the quality of the other tacos.

There is a nice large bar to the side, but unfortunately didn't have guacomole. For $2.50 per taco, I would say they are a bit pricy. Best Mexican food I have had in Pittsburgh so far.
