I've been here a couple times within last year, and I've been surprised by the lack of a crowd. I think their food a service warrants more customers. 

The value is good here especially with the salsa bar they have. I always end up ordering too much thinking it's too cheap and load up on the salsa bar, and end up with too much food.

I wish I lived closer to here, I only visited here for IKEA. Definitely worth the price and drive!
