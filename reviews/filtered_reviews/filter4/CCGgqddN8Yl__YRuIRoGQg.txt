My first experience with Richardson's was actually at the Rokerij.  When I finally got to eat in their newly redone restaurant I became a fan FOR LIFE. My boyfriend and I decided to try to get in last minute on a Saturday night, which in hindsight, was a ridiculous thought. However, on the way out a manager flagged us down and encouraged us to take advantage of their tables in the bar. This actually worked out perfectly and wasn't offered to us by the hostess, but I will most definitely look to sit in that 'hidden' area again.

I ordered their signature dish, the Pasta Heidi, and OH MY GOD. Insane. I didn't understand how pasta could be what put them on the map, but SERIOUSLY this was so good. Green chili pasta, grilled chicken, a yummy cream sauce all served on top of a tortilla. I crave this on a regular basis now.

Great ambiance with big tables which make me want to host a big dinner their just to utilize the cute space. 

This place is a must, just think about maybe making reservations ahead of time.
