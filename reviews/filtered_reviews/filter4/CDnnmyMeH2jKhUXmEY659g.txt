I arrived super early for a flight and was looking for a place to enjoy some breakfast and a beer (way early in the morning). I happened upon Barrio cafe, which was right next to my gate. I sat at the bar, ordered a beer, and took a look at their menu. They don't have a very big selection, especially for breakfast. I can't fault them for that - they're a restaurant in an airport. They're also expensive - again, I don't fault them too much for that. The food came out quickly, the bartender was nice and helpful. It helped me accept that my vacation in Arizona was over.
