I LOVE THIS PLACE!! The restaurant & food is average at best, that's the SOLE reason why it didn't receive 5 stars from me. Night time is a different story! The yards (the big margarita tubes you see) are like 12 bucks & if you love Latin music or dancing Latin music, THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE! Awesome Bachata, Reggeton, Salsa, Merengue, Cumbia, you name it! I have a blast & dance my ass off every time I go & I make it a point to go each time I'm in Vegas!
