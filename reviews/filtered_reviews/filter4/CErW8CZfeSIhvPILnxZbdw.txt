Definitely what you would expect from an El Hefe so close to ASU's campus : the waitresses and bartenders are all hot and all can dance. The food is a great modern Mexican taste and the presentations is beautiful. 

This location is much larger than the Scottsdale one and has a lot of patio space. There are 3 bars, 1 inside, 1 on the back patio and 1 on the front patio. The dining room is large and by night it is filled with people dancing to who ever is dj'ing that night. 

On their busy nights you can expect a line, but if you're trying to get into one of the more popular places, you should expect that.  The music is always fun and the crowd is always energetic. 

The staff is very friendly and always seem like they are having fun. 


Overall a great place by day or by night. Who knows you might find your future ex here.
