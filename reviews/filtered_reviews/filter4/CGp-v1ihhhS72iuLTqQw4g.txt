For whatever reason the PTO moms always pick this place and today after our mornings of school volunteering they wanted to go. 
I rarely eat here, but something about their wet burrito makes me say yes when invited. I usually get it with shredded chicken, red sauce on top and no cheese or sour cream. 
Today my food was fine, service was fine, however the PTO moms I was with were fit to be tied when the normal medium salsa was not yet prepared at 11:30. I think it was more the attitude of indifference that irritated them. Anyhoo, they definitely were not pleased. 
Items ordered were my chicken burrito, a shredded chicken tostada salad and a shredded chicken enchilada style burrito (sin desired salsa).  
I would definitely go again to Cafe Rio. Even though my PTO mom pals were pissed, I like their shredded pollo, es muy delisioso. I think I prefer Chipotle, as does my kids, but it's still good. My burrito and a fountain drink was $11 something.
