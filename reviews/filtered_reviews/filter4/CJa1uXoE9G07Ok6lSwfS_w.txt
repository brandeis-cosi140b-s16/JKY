I had a good time at pink taco; The chips were warm and I loved the margaritas. The food was satisfying, nothing extraordinary but not too bad. Nice decor, a little dark but who cares when you're in Vegas. The pool is right behind the restaurant but I haven't been there yet although it looked pretty inviting... lots of eye candy.
