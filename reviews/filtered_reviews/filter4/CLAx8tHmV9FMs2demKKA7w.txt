This is a cute place with nice decor and ambiance. Lots of gray and twinkling lights with some standard Mexican restaurant decorations. It's practically empty on weeknights. 

The service on weeknights can certainly leave something to be desired. Our server was...strange. But we she took our orders, brought our food, and checked on us. So main tasks were accomplished. But she did screw up our bill. 

The food was great, though. The trio of salsas were well worth it. You get red salsa and chips complimentary. But add the $5 trio of salsas and you get habanero salsa and two green salsas. All were tasty. I opted for the pulled chicken enchiladas with mole sauce. They were yummy. Not anywhere near the best I've ever had, but they got the job done. And bonus, the sangria was tasty too.

All in all, this was a good dining experience and I'd go again (and hopefully have a different server).
