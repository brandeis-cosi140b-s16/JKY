I know, I know ... you're thinking a little too downscale for me, a little too Chili's (not that there is anything wrong with a good Chili's).  But, I don't know, it was just bad luck all around ... a rainy day in Las Vegas (what's up with that?) and, go figure, David Guetta must have forgotten to pay his T-Mobile bill (because why else would he be dropping my calls? I'm not even sure they were getting to his number!)  So this corner turns out to not be a bad place to watch one version of the world go by ... Happy Hour starts at 3pm, and whoever criticized a Happy Hour margarita (verified with a second) of having *too* much alcohol in it?  Portions for bar food are copious, and the several servers with whom we interacted were pleasant and, if they hated their jobs, were doing a good job of disguising it.

You can spend a lot more money for a lot less in this town.
