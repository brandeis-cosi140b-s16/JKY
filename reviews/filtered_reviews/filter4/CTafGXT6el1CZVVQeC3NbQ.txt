Being new to the Phoenix area, we rely on Yelp!!  
In searching for a good Mexican restaurant last night, we stumbled across  The Original Garcia's. . Oh my good ness, it was amazing!!  The salsa was just the right spice level!!  We also enjoyed the spinach  Queso dip(yummy). The strawberry margaritas were some of the best I have ever had. I had the shrimp fajitas for my entree which  were very flavorful.  I don't remember what my husband ordered, but it was steak with jalape√±os ,green peppers in a brown sauce. He ate every last bite!!
Our servers name was Faustina, she was very very good, very attentive . We will for sure be going back!!! I would of given 5 stars, but someone told me once that the 5 star ratings get filtered out.
