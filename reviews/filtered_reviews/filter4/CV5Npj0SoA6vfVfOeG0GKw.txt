Great food great atmosphere but a tad pricey. But you really can taste what you pay for so don't let the dollars shy you away. But go to da buffet if ya want cheap food. Got the two for $44 enchiladas and the we're amazing. We licked the sauce off of our plate. Drink was really tasty but small but an experience ina glass. Fresh 3verything.
