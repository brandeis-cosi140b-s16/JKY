Even though there are not too many authentic Mexican food restaurants Poncho's Mexican Food has to be the most memorable! This is a restaurant is located near south phoenix and the exterior is very creative and has the feel of a home. The interior is about the same as the outside because the restaurant was originally a home. I really enjoyed the food it was filled with various flavors, the serving size was perfect even though I had some left overs. The service was okay because our food took a while to come out and we rarely saw the waitress. However the food was well worth the wait, I would recommend trying it at least once because the food is not something a person should not miss.
