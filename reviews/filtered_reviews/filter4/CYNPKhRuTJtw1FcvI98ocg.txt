The place was decent. It was one of my first dinners while I was in Phoenix for business.  The cornbread is yummy and the appetizer I had with shrimp with guacomole on a chip was amazing. 

Can't remember what I ordered though....so that's why I'm giving it 4 stars.  It must not have been that good that I didn't crave for it enough to go back.  I was in Phoenix for 3 loooooong weeks. 

They have Valet which is nice and there wasn't a long wait...is there ever in the Phoenix area?????
