This is a great place for a big group of friends.  The food is good, the vibe is super comfortable and since it's already going to be loud and crowded, your group won't stand out much.  I've been here for large group birthdays, and small group hanging out before a night on the town.  

Food has always been brought out quite quickly, and with a big group if you give them the ok they'll bring food out as it's ready vs. trying to wait for the entire table's order to be ready. 

Not only is the food good, it gives you that comfort food kind of feeling.  Yummy cheesy goodness.
