Purchased a gift certificate from Restaurant.com.  When we arrived, I gave the hostess my name and was added to the list for a party of 4.  I would have given a 5STAR review, but the hostess stand was the worst part.  They seemed very uninterested in seating people right away.

The restaurant has a good vibe and there was a DJ playign music, which was cool.  Our waitress was right on with the service.  When the food came it tasted as good as it looked.  As you can see from the pcitures here, the apprearance is great.  I ordered Nachos and for dinner I ordered chicken fajitas.  Both were excellent.  I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Vegas looking for a good atmosphere and food.
