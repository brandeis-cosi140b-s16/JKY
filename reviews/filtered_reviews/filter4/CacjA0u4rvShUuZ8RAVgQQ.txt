Oh my goodness! The food is delicious. Guacamole is creamy not spicy, but you can add their chipotle salsa or salsa verde to give the chips a bit more of a kick. We sat at the bar because it was the first available - yes, there's a wait for the bar in the dining area too.

I got the chilaquiles vegetales - SO GOOD. They pack it with vegetables, and its layered with corn tortillas. In fact I hadn't seen it done this way before. Had mushrooms, carrots, and golden beets. I think they add seasonal vegetables in it as well.

I got the Picoso for a drink- it's HOT. They add jalapeno to it, which gives it a kick that took me a while to distinguish from the alcohol.

Everything tastes fresh and the food is fantastic!

Service was good, but they were a bit understaffed it seemed. We're slow eaters though and all the service people were nice.

My one complaint is the wait. We waited 25 minutes for two people on a Wednesday around 6. Plus there's no seating for people waiting but they don't really call out names because it's so loud. So you kind of have to stand near the front when your table is about ready to be called out and try not to get in anyone's way. For the first 15 minutes we waited out by the beautiful relaxing pool.

On wednesday nights at 7 they have flamenco as well.
