Cafe rio been eatting their food numerous times. I first was offered a free meal when the w sahara location first opened I had the chicken salad with the ranch special dressing and was hooked. 

I lived in many parts of las Vegas and still find myself going to this place when I crave some food that is tasty but is not overlapsed with cheese and typical Mexican overwhelming heavy ingredients.

Atmosphere is very casual and friendly for families. 
Service is quick and to the point: let's get your food and enjoy

went to the gran opening of cafe rio and the one also in Maryland parkway across unlv.  Very friendly both times 

Can't go wrong for a dinner after a day of work.
