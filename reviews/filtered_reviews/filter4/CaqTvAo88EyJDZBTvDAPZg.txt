The Mill and Baseline location is excellent. Service is fast and friendly, prices are reasonable and portions generous.  Their veggie burro is excellent with big fresh chunks of avacodo, mm hmm. Their chips and salsa are also better than most casual taco shops. You can order ahead and pick up at the take out windows.
