So since that first burrito, I have been back a few times to try something new each time. And I have to say that the burritos haven't changed in taste or size lol. It's still yummy and still hefty enough to be shared. There was still a weird after taste but I found that it grew on me. The chicken burrito was yummy but I think I like the machaca burrito the best. Get a burrito with some salsa and some guac and I'm a happy girl.
