If this is New Mexican food, than I want to go to New Mexico...  I had the blue Corn Enchiladas, Christmas style and they were great.. I wanted to keep on eating them, but alas just could not take one more bite.    The Cilantro Margarita was so refreshing.       All of us enjoyed our food and margaritas..  

The place is hard to find in the dark, It is on the NW corner of Warner and Lindsay, but  infront of a medical strip mall.   To the west of Big O tire and circle K.  The parking can be tight, so park behind the medical center and walk.  You will want to walk  after eating all the food.

That night we had a very slow waitress, not sure what the deal was, but would not stop us from going back
