I happened to come here when it wasn't busy and I enjoyed it very much! I ended up getting a breakfast burrito with steak instead of chorizo and a roasted jalapeno. For my morning beverage pairing, I went with a cochata. The burrito was very good. I really liked the steak better than the chorizo in it and the beans were excellent; also, the jalapeno was super fresh! I really appreciate a fresh pepper like that. What really got me though was the cochata. It's pretty simple, coffee and horchata, but I had never had it before. The flavors go together very well, and if you like sweet coffee drinks, you should love this! I can't wait for the weather to get cool again because the patio looked awfully cozy and would be a great place to enjoy a cerveza.
