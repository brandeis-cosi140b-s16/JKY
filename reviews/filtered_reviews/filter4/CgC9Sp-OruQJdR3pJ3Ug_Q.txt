Mundo is a great addition to downtown dining. It has a nice loungey atmosphere and good sangrias.
As far as Mexican food goes in Vegas for Vegetarians, I have not been impressed. So far happy hour at Pink Taco has been the best option.
Mundo is a bit pricey but if you are looking to have a nice Mexican meal with a cocktail... this is the place.

I absolutely LOVE the chopped salad. Its the best.
The side dishes are also good ( the corn is my favorite)
The tortilla soup is a vegetable base soup and it is also good.
Other options include veggie quesadilla and enchilada. 
If you enjoy fish, supposedly that is good there as well.
