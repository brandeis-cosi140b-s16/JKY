I am a true New Mexican food snob and I do like this La Ristra.  I love the Blue Corn Enchiladas with green chile sauce.  For me the hotter, the better.  The Adovada Ribs are excellent.  For those familiar with Los Dos Molinos, there is a family relationship between the restaurants.  Sometimes the service is the bar is not the best, but the food is always good.
