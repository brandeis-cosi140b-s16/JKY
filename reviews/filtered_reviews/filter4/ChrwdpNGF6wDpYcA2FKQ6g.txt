A little late but better than never, review from visit Sept 2011

The freebies upon arrival: 
*Home made guac/flour tortilla chips/salsa (chips are a little greasy...but can't complain too much especially when it's free!)
*Bottled water....not the nasty tap stuff that tastes like lead pipes

Food...I've only tried their fusion tacos and fusion burritos, but the meat is flavorful/tender....quality of what you would find at the korean bbq places but placed on a tortilla or stuffed into a burrito.  The chicken taco seems like just normal grilled chicken to me...so I would opt for beef or pork tacos.  The portion sizes are generous especially given the fact that their tacos are $1.29 each and burritos are $4.99.  And there's the bonus gift of a side of kim chee if so desired.  

Sauces:
Chinese sauce-"nose starts running" spicy to me...they usually put this with every order unless you request the other sauces.
Korean sauce-extremely red in color, but has a sweet-spicy kick...my personal favorite and needs to be requested if ordering to go.
Green sauce-never tried...green sauces scare me.

Ambiance....LOL there is none....other than this screams hole in the wall joint.  This place is down right ugly inside....but the friendly korean family that owns this place makes up for the dismal interior.  The seats are a little ghetto...WARNING: for all those without junk in the trunk....if you sit in the wrong spot where there is a hole in the bench cushion you may get sucked in

Rumor has it they are going to open another location soon along the 215....and for those who are too lazy to cook for parties....you can order party platters.  They give you a big stack of tortillas, big platter of meat, and the vegetable slaw/dressing on the side...so you can assemble them fresh at home for a very reasonable price!
