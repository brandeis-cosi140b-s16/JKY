I gave this place 4 start for their guacamole alone.  they make it to order at your table - Delicious!  The place is usually busy for lunch or dinner. The food is the americanized mexican but has some things  you would not expect.  Overall the food is prepared very well.  I have had the filet mignon tacos, grilled pork loin, tacos and burritos.  

The place has a great bar and serves up some nice drinks.  It is a good place to meet friends and I have been with several large parties and the services has been spot on.
