I don't know Phoenix well enough to know the great debates over what taco joint is the best in town. I quizzed every local store clerk I could until I got a very passionate recommendation from the girl working at Smeeks, so my pal and I drove over and checked it out.

I have to also say that being from Michigan, my review is totally slanted by the fact that I drank a Coke with real sugar in it and chowed down on an awesome carne asada quesadilla on a sunny outdoor patio in mid-January. And really, I could care less if that influenced my review, because I was in love with the moment, and that's all that mattered.

Big time bonus points for the guy at the counter, who took my order, talked to me about the Creature From the Black Lagoon, and was in general very nice. I got out under $10 and still enjoyed a great meal that I'll remember for a while.

I know if I come back to Phoenix that I'll have to check out the competition, but for my money I thought America's Taco Shop was well worth the recommendation.
