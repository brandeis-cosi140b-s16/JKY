I went to Blanco on a Thursday night for Happy Hour. We arrived right around 4:30 and were seated immediately. Our table was right between the dining room and the patio, so we were able to take advantage of the beautiful breeze without having to sit outside. What a cute restaurant- very open and chic.

We both started with the Pomegranate/Grapefruit Margarita- a great option if you like a little bit of sweetness in your marg. It was served on the rocks, so it went down pretty quickly. Following the Pom/Grape Margarita, I decided to give their Classic Margarita a shot. It tasted like it was made with real lime juice instead of boat loads of sweet and sour mix, so that was a major plus!

The chips and salsa were great. Nice, thick chips and a hearty salsa with just a touch of spice. We decided to try the Queso Fundido, as we are both huge fans of most queso dips. The server warned us that this was very different from the normal queso, but we ordered it anyways. It arrived in a small pan and was thick! It had been baked which transformed it from a diappable treat to a "fork some onto my chip" experience. It was also served with fresh flour tortillas which were much appreciated. The biggest downfall of this dish was the chorizo. The chorizo was slightly burnt and was dripping grease everywhere. Gross. 

The drinks were great, the chips and salsa were delicious, and the menu is still full of other items I'd love to try.

Our bill for the four margaritas and the queso came out to $22- fantastic happy hour prices!
