I found the food here to be an experience- the pork belly and guacamole were both to die for.  The drinks were amazing too - we ordered the special margarita and bloody mary and they were both great.  What I wasn't so happy about was the treatment by the hostess.  We had a reservation at 8PM and didn't get seated until 9:30PM.  No offer to comp our drinks or an appetizer, no apology.  We were so hungry were were about ready to leave.  For that I felt like the hostess should get fired.  But I must say the food was worth the wait.
