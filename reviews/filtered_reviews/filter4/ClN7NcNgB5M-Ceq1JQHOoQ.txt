Casa Reyna might just be my new favorite Mexican restaurant in Pittsburgh. This is probably as close to authentic Mexican cuisine as you will find in the city. The tacos and salsas were fresh and full of flavors. The fact they make their tacos onsite likely helps. The margarita was one of the best that I've ever had as well. My only reason for not giving Casa Reyna five stars is the price. It seems expensive compared to other Mexican restaurants. That being said, I'll be back often just not as frequently as I'd like.
