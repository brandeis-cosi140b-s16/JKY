Server team was really on point. Very on top of things. The speed of service could have been a little slowed down. I get it they are going into prime time and want to turn tables, but you shouldn't go so fast that guests feel rushed. Not saying it was bad or intentional. They were just so on top of things they were focused on speed. Hence the 4 stars not 5. Excellent dinner overall. Were already talking about when we were going back. Excellent view of the city. Congratulations to a family that has been working for many years in this city opening one successfull store after another.

We definitely overate. Who order 3 desserts for 4 ppl at a mexican restaurant?
