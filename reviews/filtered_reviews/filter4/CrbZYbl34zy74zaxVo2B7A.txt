The Cantina Shooters were very good. Stuffed Jalapeno's with a cream sauce in a Shot Glass. Presentation was great. There were six of us on a Tuesday night - the place was hopping busy and everyone enjoyed their food and service from the Chili Rellenos, Cheese Enchiladas, Shrimp Tacos, Carne Asada. Some of us shared dishes - the portions are large. Also the Sopapillas with cinnamon Ice cream and whipped cream for dessert were great. Our server & hostess were very nice as we mentioned it was our first time here. Very lucky to live down the street - we will be back soon. Only negative was the wine and mixed drinks were pricey but the local draft beers are fairly priced. I imagine they have a nice happy hour and will check that out.
