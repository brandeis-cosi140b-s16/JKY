T & T! It's dynamite! 

T & T! It tastes so right! 

T & T! Gives me a power load! 

T & T! Watch my butt explode!

Bad AC/DC sample aside, Tacos & Tequila (T & T) is actually pretty good even though it's ridiculously overpriced even by Las Vegas standards. 

Seriously, this city will use any opportunity to overcharge you. On my last trip, they charged me 33 percent more for an escort because she had two legs and most of her teeth. Kidding. 

No really, I am kidding.

When my 11 day work trip to Las Vegas bled into the fifth day (and into the weekend), I needed to unwind a bit by watching the first round of the NFL playoffs in a sports bar environment. I had passed by this joint on the way to work a few times, so I gave it a shot. Luckily, it filled the bill (in more ways than one).

I walked up and asked for a table for one near a screen. Quickly, two pretty hostesses greeted me and sat me at the bar in front of some nice high definition screens. The bartender immediately put some chips and salsa in front me, asked if I wanted a drink, and presented the menu to me. Without question, the service at "T&T" is dynamite.

Bad joke aside, the food is also awesome. My order was promptly taken and soon enough I was munching on some awesome chips and salsa, sipping on a drink, and high fiving sports fans around me. Eventually, my order came out with 4 tacos of various meats with melted cheese on top. They were freakin' delicious. 

The price is a bit steep for food and/or drinks. But then again, the more you drink, the better it all tastes, and the less price seems to matter. 

Remember, when it doesn't matter how much the drinks cost, it's always happy hour.
