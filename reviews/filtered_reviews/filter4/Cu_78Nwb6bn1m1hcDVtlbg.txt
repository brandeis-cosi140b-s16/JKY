Aye Carumba, Fantastico!  Yep, I like this place, alot!

1.  Service - Personable, many of staff have been there quite a long time, so they know the menu well, are passionate about what they do, and will recommend the right things for you if you are not sure what to eat.

2.  Food - The chicken, seafood and meat dishes are all great.  We had the Ropa Viejas and the Camerones. They were very tasty. The appetizers I did not have, but have seen them  and they look great.

3.  Drinks - The type of drinks and mixed drinks are great.  Mojitos baby! OK, we had cokes and ice tea.

4.  Dessert - So tasty. We had a chocolate tres leches special that is home made. All their desserts are home made. Wonderful.

5.  Price - Very reasonable.

They also have dancing on the weekends. This is a nice place to relax, go on a date, or just hang with the friends!

Enjoy!!!!!
