The tortas are amazing. The tacos have simple, yet fresh and flavorful ingredients. The guacamole is the best I've had in town, hands down.

But you wanna know the BEST thing about Gallo Blanco?

Sunday brunch. 

The breakfast stuff is always available and they probably do brunch all weekend, I don't know. I DO know that I have been twice on an early Sunday afternoon, and when every other "cool" brunch spot had lines around the block, my dining companion and I were able to walk right in and sit down here.

My brunch favorites: 
* Egg torta. The flavors are simple, but rich. 
* Egg and chorizo. How do they keep the sausage juicy without being greasy? It's a kitchen marvel. 
* Pancakes. OK, their pancake might just be perfect. It has delicately crispy edges and a custardy center. No chewy frisbee at Gallo Blanco. Deluxe!
* A simple thing, but fresh squeezed OJ really hits the spot and makes a delightful mimosa.

They only lose a star because they could use a few more breakfast offerings. Like breakfast tacos.

Of course telling you all this probably means a line this Sunday. But it's worth it, everyone should know about this hidden gem!
