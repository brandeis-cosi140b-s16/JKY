Barbacoa is the way to go. Have it in tacos, burritos, tostadas, quesadillas, enchiladas or a salad. Whatever it is, barbacoa should be the choice. The fact that it is noted for winning awards initially caught my interest, but after tasting it I cannot stop ordering just this protein.

This location is the busiest out of all the them. Every time I come, I am left waiting in line for 10-15 minutes. The employees manning the line are quick and efficient, but there is only so much a person can do while waiting for grill room to free up.

Regardless of minor inconveniences, I do enjoy their food from time to time.
