WIth all the rave reviews on yelp, my friends and I thought we'd give it a try. 

The restaurant is pretty small, and rather crowded with other yelpers. Expect to wait a few minutes for a table to clear up or order take out. 

The food was decently priced for the portions you were given. The bulgogi burrito was amazingly delicious, and I would recommend it to any first timers going to komex. Sharing fries was a good decision, as it took 3 of us to finish the plate. 

We had to pay at the counter, like a school cafeteria, but that was most likely because of the limited staff. 

Good food, good price, not the best environment.
