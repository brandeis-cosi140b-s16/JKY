The good here is great! Very authentic and fresh. Their lunch specials are great and you can't beat the price either. This last time I had the carnitas and tortilla soup and both were AMAZING! This if definitely one of my favorite places. Only con is the server was pretty slow and it took forever to get a refill on our drinks.
