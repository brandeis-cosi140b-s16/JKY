Here's all you need to know about Burrito Factory in two words: Taco Tuesdays. Fresh-made, delicious tacos with your choice of fillings for a buck apiece, and they aren't skimpy with the ingredients. Choose from chicken, spicy chicken, marinated pork or ground beef (if you're boring) protein, and a plethora of toppings. 
Being my predictable self, I go for the heat with spicy chicken, diced jalapenos, hot pico de gallo, queso fresco, lettuce, salsa, fresh cilantro and cheese. Skip the .75 extra guacamole in favor of the addictively sweet heat of their creamy green tomatillo sauce, free on the self-serve bar. Seriously, it's so good I always take some home in the little clear containers. Oh yeah, free salsa and chips with every order. Since it's so good and prices are so cheap, please also bless the tip jar and go home happy and satisfied.
