Best tortillas in AZ . . . super thin and soft.  The only other tortillas I have had that are comparable are homemade ones my friend used to bring back from Tijuana.  The dishes themselves are ok, not spectacular.  I do like the breakfast burritos with egg, potatoes and chorizo though; unlike the other dishes, they are quite flavorful.  In fact, these are my favorite breakfast burritos from any establishment.
