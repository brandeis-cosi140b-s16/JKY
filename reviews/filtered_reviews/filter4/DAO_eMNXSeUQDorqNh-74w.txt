This is a nice place to stop by for a quick beer and tacos - 
usually fast service and reasonable prices. Its great for a quick lunch on a warm day (just don't sit on the west side in summer). Its in a strip mall
near Fry's - so I don't expect top notch Mexican cuisine or a place to impress a dinner date. Just a fun stop while out running errands and a welcome addition to the neighborhood...
