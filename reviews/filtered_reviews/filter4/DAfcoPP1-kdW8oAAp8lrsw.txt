Finally tried this place today and was not disappointed! Sunday afternoon, nice weather and they were packed! Ordered a shrimp and a fish taco and they were very good, fresh ingredients and they were just the right size. Salsa is very good, but if you want more spice ask for the habanero version. My only complaint is that they don't have full sized pitchers of beer...small ones at about 2.5 pints each. However, that being said it was happy hour (we were there about 1pm) and they were only $5 so all is forgiven. I like that you can sit outside and the back outside patio has a large grass area so if you bring your kids they can lounge around and not bother anyone as it is not right next to any tables. Will for sure go again!!
