My wife and I decided to try this place one night since it's close by and wanted good mexican food. Love the area and the setting. Nice patio section. Service was great.
My wife is a big nachos fan so that's what she ordered. It had great flavor, but she just didn't like the presentation. She likes a pile of messy nachos and these are served with perfectly layered and topped chips. I had a corn tamale and a chicken tamale with black beans and rice. I thought they were outstanding. Good flavor, just not an extraordinary amount of meat, but it was fine with me. Tasted great. The black beans were excellent also. Rice was rice, nothing special.
Prices are on the up side for what you get, but I sometimes don't mind paying it if it's good food, as this was. I had one draft beer, which was $6 I believe, since I was not sitting at the bar to get happy hour prices. Definitely don't like that idea. Why do I HAVE to sit at the bar to get happy hour prices? Why have a nice setting in the cafe and nice patio if you're not going to give me happy hour prices while I'm there?
