Saw the rave reviews on this spot and decided to try it. My friend and I are New Yorkers so we decided to walk there from our hotel at the Venetian, cabs are pricey!
So we begin walking, and walking, annddd walking. First suggestion, do not walk. It is off the strip and we went at night, very sketchy just because of the isolation and the multiple limos pulling up to offer to take us free to strip clubs. Speaking of strip clubs, we then approach a sign for the 'largest strip club' in Vegas, we were confused on where our restaurant was as it should have been where the light up signs and limos for the strip club were approaching.

Yes, this restaurant is in the same building as a massive strip club, the entrance to the restaurant is next door to the entrance of the club. Don't let that put you off though! Food was good. Street tacos were excellent and the rice and beans were YUM!! Service was great, very friendly. Would definitely recommend, just be aware of the location if you are bringing the kids or conservative family members. Oh, and uber a ride back.
