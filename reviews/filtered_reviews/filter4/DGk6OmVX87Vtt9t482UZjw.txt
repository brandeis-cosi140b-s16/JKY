We ate there today because we had an Entertainment Book coupon.  Would never have even seen the place otherwise.  The only negative is that it was hot inside, but that was OK, since it was a beautiful day and we ate outside.

One of the employees asked me if we had been there before, since I'm sure we don't look like regulars.  I had the fish burrito and my husband had the chicken burrito.  Definitely plenty of food.  They gave us complimentary chips and told us to ask if we wanted any more.  One of the employees came outside to see how we liked everything.  The quality of the food at such a reasonable price is something we will remember.
