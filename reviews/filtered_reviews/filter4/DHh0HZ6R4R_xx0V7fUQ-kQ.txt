I'm from Texas, so I have pretty high standards for Mexican food. I started off with a negative opinion of Casa Reyna, because they broke two important rules for Mexican restaurants:
1. They charge for chips and salsa. Although the price is only $3 for tons of chips and two types of salsa, no one would ever come to your restaurant in Texas if they found out that chips and salsa weren't free.
2. For their lunch portions, you get only one side so you must choose between rice or beans instead of having both. In Texas, this is also a huge no-no.

That being said, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the food at Casa Reyna was actually really good, and so I can forgive their sins. 

We ordered the chips and salsa with the salsa roja and salsa verde. While neither sauce was particularly spicy (only the roja claimed to be), they were both very flavorful and zesty. 

I ordered the Enchiladas Reynas (chicken enchiladas with a lime cilantro sour cream sauce) with a side of black beans. All of the flavors in the sauce worked well together (although it was just a tad too acidic) and the chicken was juicy. The black beans tasted great too. Overall, it was a plate of enchiladas that you could expect to see in any top notch Tex-Mex place in the Lone Star state. 

If you are in the Pittsburgh area and you want some good Mexican food, I would definitely recommend Casa Reyna.
