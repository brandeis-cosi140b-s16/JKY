Excellent specials and great food.  I had the steak with crab legs and it was cooked just how I ordered it.  We had 7 people in our party so they gave us a private room which worked out swell.  I recommend dining downstairs where there are comfy chairs and a fireplace.  The brie and steak on crostini appetizer is to die for!
