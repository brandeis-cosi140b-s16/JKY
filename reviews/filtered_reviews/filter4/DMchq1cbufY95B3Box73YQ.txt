Can't go wrong with a place named Tacos and Beer. They're the two things I love in life. Apparently it can get packed here, but the two times I have been here have been pretty chill. They have a great selection of beer. Lots of different IPAs which is a plus for this hop head. The tacos are good. Not amazing, but still good. Slightly bigger than a street taco, there is a lot of ones to choose from. I have tried the chicken tinga, carne asada, barbacoa, shrimp, pastor, and carnitas. With a good vibe, good food, great beer selection, and friendly staff, this place is definitely worth checking out.
