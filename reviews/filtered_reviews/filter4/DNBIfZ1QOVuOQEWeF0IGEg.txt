Tonight I tried something new. The "El Molcajete". It's a tomato, garlic, jalape√±o sauce made fresh in a scalding hot lava rock bowl with grilled steak, shrimp and grilled cactus. Served with fajita sides it was spicy and very good. My wife and I could share it easily. If you are like me get the habanero salsa as a side and bump up the spice. Great different meal.
