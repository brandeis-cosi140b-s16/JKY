I should only order enchiladas @ Carolina's, I guess, because I am always disappointed when I order them anywhere else.  One star for excellent service, one star for awesome beans, one star for serving Pepsi, and one star for plentiful bike racks along Mill Ave.  Found the popular American music an odd choice...Stevie Nicks is not what I expect to hear while I'm noshing on chips and salsa.  The chips and salsa are complimentary.  And the salsa has a slight bite and is very flavorful.
