Luckily we didn't have to wait too long on a Friday night for a party of 6. It's a neat looking restaurant with their memorabilia out for sale. 

The chips and salsa were delicious and I almost killed myself eating them. Everyone ordered tacos but me. I ordered the Carne Asada burrito. It was really good but I would get the taco plate next time. 

It's a cool casual atmosphere and I'm looking forward to trying what they are known for next time, tacos of course.
