The recent elite event at Verde reminded me, I'm definitely in need of a re-review of this place! Since our first encounter, I have taken my own advice several times and come here, treating it as a bar more than a restaurant, reveling in a variety of tequilas, and cocktails involving it. They bring around your first round of chips for free if you're at a table, and they're unlimited at the bar. Along with the chips, their appetizers are usually enough to split between two people over drinks, but they usually have a few items on special so you might want to enjoy a flatbread made with the freshest ingredients they could find that day.

Being one who enjoys to branch out as much as I can, I love to come in for their Agave Wednesdays, that is: a half-oz 'taste' of any tequila on their wall(that is usually priced under $18) for only $3! So, you can create your own flights of tequila to suit your tastes, or let the bartender know what you like and have them spin up their own. Be sure to ask for the iPad menu to get an interactive look at their selection, along with tasting notes and label texts. 

Their patio recently opened, which is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. Service has also been greatly improved since the last view - now very attentive and friendly, if not still a bit scripted. The bartenders are all wonderful, very well versed in all of the tequilas and in making excellent cocktails.

If you're looking to grab a few drinks or get an education in tequila, and get some excellent modern mexican-inspired snacks(And maybe dinner, but I haven't tried in a while), Verde is probably the best place to stop. Be sure to heed the warning on the door about parking - if you park in the Glass Lofts lot, there is about a 110% chance of getting towed.

Also, Verde now serves brunch saturdays and sundays, which is delicious!
