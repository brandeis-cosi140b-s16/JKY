Our granddaughters always like for us to bring them to Carlos O'Briens.  This trip, as others was a pleasant evening.  My husband tried their chili.  He wasn't sure about getting chili in a Mexican restaurant, but found it was different and really good.  The granddaughters liked the chips and salsa probably best of all.  Great salsa and nice fresh chips.  Our meals were all good and of large proportions.  We took enough home with us for the girls parents to eat take out at home.  Granddaughters also had dessert which was a large chocolate chips cookie, nice and warm, with a couple of scoops of ice cream on top.  What they didn't finish of the large dessert, my husband finished before we left the restaurant.  We will definitely be back.
