I've been here three times, and each time I've never been disappointed. The fish tacos are delectable, the chopped salad is delicious and I usually end up eating so much of their awesome salsa and chips that I barely have room for my entree. I've tried the Salmon al Pastor and both the presentation and flavors are wonderful. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is because I've been told they're working on adding to the menu so I'm waiting for this place to be even more awesome.
