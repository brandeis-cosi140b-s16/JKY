This placed was jammed packed on the weekend! A 30 min wait upon entry but it went by pretty fast. There so much going on and also a mariachi band playing the entire time to keep you entertained.
-Soon as you are seated you are greeted with chips, salsa and re-fried beans. We asked for the guacamole and our server came right back and prepared it table side for u. It was some of the best i ever ate!
-I had the garlic fish with re-fried beans and rice that come with the entree. You choice of flower or corn tortillas that are homemade. My wife mentioned it was our wedding anniversary, we were surprised with a solo performance from the staff and the ban. They place sombreros on our heads and had a slam a shot of tequila was a good time. Complimentary churros were brought out while they sang to us...Delish!!
