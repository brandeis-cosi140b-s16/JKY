The fact that these guys were on Food Network when in their old location on Union Hills definitely helps drive their business.  That plus they are really the only "take out" Mexican joint in Anthem.

They really are authentic, and everything on the menu is fantastic.  My fav is always the Al Pastor pork.  It comes in a platter or burrito, if you ask them they will make it with rice and beans inside the burrito for you.  Also good is the carne asada and any of their tacos.

The only thing I will say is to try and avoid their dinner rush, cos it can take a while (30 minutes) to wait for your food.  Although they have hired more staff and the wait has improved.
