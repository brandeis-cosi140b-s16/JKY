This was a very fun place. It had, maybe, the most diverse menu I've seen in a tex-mex place. 

I had some hybrid tacos, The guacamole was tangly and really tasty. They did a good burrito as well. 

The decor was really cool with some day of the dead type murals. A very fun environment. The front opened to let lots of fresh air, making it like eating outside. 

Our waiter was really good. Kept the sodas and water coming. The food came out promptly and was hot. 

All in all, it was a good time.
