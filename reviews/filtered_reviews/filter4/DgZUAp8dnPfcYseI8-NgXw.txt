This place gets slammed at lunch and I don't think the restaurant does that well of managing the rush.  I have been here a few times and you typically need to wait longer than usual for your food.  The food quality is good and the service is ok if you can catch one of them.  The prices are surprisingly low... overall the place is just ok.
