There are only a coupl'a things that prevent me from giving this place one more star. 

1.  I thought their guacamole was way overpriced at 8.00 and not at all like the guacamole I've had prepared fresh at my table for the same price.  

2.  I ordered the agua fresca in watermelon (which was delicious, by the way), but my friend ordered the pineapple one and hers tasted like colored water.  Seriously.  It was like night and day in comparing the two drinks.  When I took a sip, I was surprised they would even bring it out.  When we pointed out the weak flavor, the server only was able to suggest the watermelon like I had.  Hmm....

So I was here on the 13th and thought their food was actually pretty good.  It was far better than what I could get in the DC area after living in CA all my life and having the luxury of choosing a different awesome Mexican restaurant for every day of the week.

We didn't get any other appetizer, but the salsas that came with the guacamole were outstanding.

I ordered a sampler plate that consisted of a pork simmered in orange juice and the ropa vieja.  Both dishes were really tasty and I enjoyed them veyr much.

My friend ordered the appetizer sampler plate.  I don't recall exactly what was on it, but I do remember taking a bite of the chicken mole, which was done very nicely.

We were there pretty early, so we were the first customers to arrive.  While were were there, a couple was seated nearby.  I didn't see anyone else after that.

The atmosphere is lively and cozy at the same time.  Lots of care went into decorating it, as there are many personal touches.  There is a parking lot behind the restaurant, which beats having to find a spot on the street.

I will be back in Phoenix in December...I hope they have their liquor license by then!  A margarita or a beer would make the meal complete and then I would give it that extra star!
