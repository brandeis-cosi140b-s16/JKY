The food is 5 +++ Stars! Completely unique and so flavorful. I can't say enough about the Quesa's (except I really hope they are fat free...hehe) Their tacos are even great after a 15 min car ride back to my home. Everything I have tried has been very tasty! 

The Salsa's are 5++++ Stars! The cilantro cream, holy moly can I have a gallon to put on anything and everything...I really  think it will make everything taste amazing!

Over all La Condesa is a great Gourmet Taco shop and the quality of the food definitely  puts the Gourmet in the name. I love using La Condesa as take home food for out of town guest, they are always impressed!

What knocks my review down a star, difficulty parking and the lack of AC in the summer. I much prefer to get it to go!
