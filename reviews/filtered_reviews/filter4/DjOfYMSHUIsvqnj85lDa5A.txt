Heard many good things about this restaurant and have driven by many times.  Decided to try it on a Sunday afternoon after church. 

There were a few other people there watching the World Cup on the one TV that is in there and the people were acting like they had their first beer.

Had to try the street tacos so we ordered the Costillo,  Al Pastor Pork, Pork Belly and Skirt Steak along with the fresh guacamole and corn on the cob.

Would recommend the Skirt Steak and Al Pastor along with the fresh guacamole which are excellent. 

The corn on the cob just had too much sauce and spices with the mayo on it. I grew up eating my corn on the cob with miracle whip so for me not to be knocked over by the mayo combination then they just did not get it right.

I enjoyed the inside and it also has a nice huge patio area but at lunch time at 110 degrees we decided to eat inside.

A nice first time impression and will come back to try other items.
