Wow!  What a happy hour!  The food here is incredible and during happy hour all the small plates are only $5 each!  This gave us an opportunity, over a few visits, to try almost everything on the small plate menu.  The first time we were there, we ordered the bacon-wrapped shrimp, the steak skewers and the brie mushroom toast.  For two people this was a meal in itself!  We were full by the end.  

The bacon wrapped scallops, the tenderloin toast and the oysters were ordered on the next trip.  Thinking this couldn't nearly be enough food, we ordered the chicken tacos too.  The oysters Rokerij were incredible!  I'm not a big fan of oysters - in fact, can't eat them unless they are covered with lots of gooey stuff.  These were a step above Rockefeller!  The bacon-wrapped scallops and the shrimp both are served with three different sauces on the plate.  It would be best if you tried all three.  My favorite is the spicy red sauce.  They are all very good and everything tastes better with bacon!  The chicken tacos were not my favorite.  There was a funky taste to them that I can't pinpoint.  I'm not against trying them again...

The bartenders are great!  Can't beat the service here (at least in the downstairs bar).

Happy Hour is only from 3pm to 6pm, which makes it hard to get there after working until 5pm, and prices are only good if you are sitting at one of the bars (there is one upstairs and one downstairs).  The bartenders upstairs are attentive and for the most part friendly but not nearly as good as the bartenders downstairs.  They make you feel at home and will do everything to try to accommodate you and your party.  The new Richardson's is opening soon next door and we are looking forward to trying that.  But our heart is with Rokerij.
