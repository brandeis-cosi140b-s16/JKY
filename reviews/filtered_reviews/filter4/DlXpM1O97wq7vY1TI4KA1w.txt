Richardson's is New Mexican Cuisine and is similar to Mexican and Tex Mex but is slightly different. The Big Things here are the Potato stuffed green chile and the do you want Red or Green Chile Sauce question.

I tried the Santa Fe Chicken. It came out on a very large ornate silver platter. I have to say everything on my plate was delicious! The chicken was pecan grilled and was very moist and flavorful. It was topped with sautéed mushrooms and Jalapeño hollandaise sauce and served over tasty garlic toast. It was delicious as it was but I though it was shy with the jalapeño. I had my choice of side and went with the house specialty Potato stuffed Green Chile. It had some heat to it but not too much and was delicious. Also on my plate was a very large salad that was mostly cheese. For me it was WHEY too much cheese but the salad was fresh and lightly dressed with a very thin white dressing.

My husband tried the New Mexican Enchiladas. He had a trio of pork, chicken and beef Christmas Style with Red and Green Chile Sauce also filling the plate was rice and beans. He said everything was seasoned nice and everything tasted different and his plate was also very generous with LOTS OF CHEESE.

Based on this one exsperience the food seems solid but you'll need to cheddar a few pounds if you eat all the cheese.

You Cheddar believe it.
