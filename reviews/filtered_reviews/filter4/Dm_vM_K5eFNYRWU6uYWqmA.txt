Yup, I took a friend and went back again after reading some of the reviews. I thought maybe we got lucky the first time around. Still some of the BEST Mexican food and service was good. We sat outside and again the staff was great about getting a heater near us for comfort. We had to wait a little bit for the bill, but other than that, I still think this is a great new restaurant. We ordered tacos, guacamole, flan and two sodas. I'm still not sure what some of the items are, but that's just an excuse to go back. One of the staff/workers told us about the local artists that did the tables and art work, and the concept of the restaurant. I still love this place. YUM.
