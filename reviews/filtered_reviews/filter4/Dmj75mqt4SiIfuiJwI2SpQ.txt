I'm a fan of this modern Mexican restaurant.  I celebrated my bday bash here and the food and mojitos were delish.  Being vegetarian i was apprehensive about this place, but the options and taste was YUM! The portions are huge, so if you want to watch the calories and fat definitely share your entree. If you decide to make it a event with a group of friends I recommend to make reservations a week in advance, that way there is no wait and they can make the necessary accommodations for your party.
