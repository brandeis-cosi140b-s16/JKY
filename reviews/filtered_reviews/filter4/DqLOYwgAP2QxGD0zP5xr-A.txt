The first time i had Roberto's, I was a fan. I have to say Roberto's makes me miss living in Las Vegas. Their chimichanga's are to die for, and you can't leave there without getting a fried cinnamon stick, very authentic for fast food and just down right delicious. Out of all the Mexican joint's i've been too this has to be one of my favorite.
