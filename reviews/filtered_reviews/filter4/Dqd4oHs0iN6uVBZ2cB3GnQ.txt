Food is great!  Service: so-so.  Last time I was there, we sat outside.  The tables were very dirty and gross.  The tables are wooden slats, so the food drops between them and I am sure hard to clean.  Mabe the manager should look into getting different tables.  Other than that, we do enjoy it there.  Been a customer since they opened.
