So my mom came into town last night and after a night of drinking at Finnegan's, my belly was asking for a tasty Carolina's burrito. My mom was impressed with the homemade tortillas and enjoyed two green tamales, a chorizo burrito and coffee. Hubby ordered chorizo, egg and cheese burrito, that disappeared in minutes. My taste bud enjoyed each and every bite of my potato, egg and cheese burrito......like a bite of heaven. The bill was super cheap, 15 for three people! We left full and smiling.
