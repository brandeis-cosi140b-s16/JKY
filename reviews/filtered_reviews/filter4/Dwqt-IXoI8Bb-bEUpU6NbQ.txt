I feel like I've been searching all over the valley for NM style food! We made the 40 mile drive over here to meet with some friends because we heard that this was the place to go for NM food. We were seated right away & started with some cocktails which were great. Our server brought out a platter of chips with 4 different dips/salsas, score! I ordered the shredded beef burrito enchilada style which was SOO good. The meat was so flavorful & it was actual green chile! I felt like I was back home in NM :) My husband ordered ground beef gorditas which he loved. Our friend ordered chicken gorditas but they brought out beef & it took a very very long time for him to receive the correct order. We were all finished with our food by the time his arrived.  Our server never apologized for the error, just kinda took the plate & left which is what took my review from a 5 star to a 4. When we were leaving around 12:30pm people were lined up all outside, this place gets pretty busy! Can't wait to come back here for another burrito!
