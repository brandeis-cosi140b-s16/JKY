My husband and I decided to try this place based on a friend's recommendation. It was very good! We tried their Bulgogi burrito and it makes you think why has no one ever done it before. The staff was helpful and friendly and through the yelp deal, we got a free order of fried wontons. Their chips and salsa was also tasty.

The only downside is that I wished they had a bigger location do seating wouldn't be a problem. With how popular this joint is becomingg, customers are having some trouble fighting for tables.
