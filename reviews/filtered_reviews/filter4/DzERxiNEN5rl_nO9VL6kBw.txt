This is the kind of place that Yelp is made for.  It's a hole in the wall that is faaarrr from the Strip.  I don't even know what part of town I was in.  Thank goodness for GPS.  It's located in a tiny strip mall and is simply furnished.  There was one asian woman running all the tables, and she did a great job considering the steady stream of customers.  We ordered the pork and beef taco for about $1 each.  Incredible how much they gave you for that amount of money.  I was pretty sated with my two tacos, but I whipped my wimpy appetite into submission and downed half a chicken burrito and 1/3 of the kim chi fried rice rec'd by all you Yelpers.  They were both good, and even tastier with the hot sauce (salsa?  kim chi?  kim chi salsa??).  (There were 3 sauces on the condiment basket...I think the other were regular asian chili sauce and something with a hint of sweetness...iunno.  the salsa was my favorite).  I enjoyed the food enough, but am not sure if I'd go out of my way to return here when there are so many other places to try out in Vegas.
