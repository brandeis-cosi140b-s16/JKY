If your looking for some legit street tacos Taco y Taco is spot to be. Although when we arrived we weren't sure where to line up because there are different stations. They should put some signs up for first timers. 

I ended up getting 3 tacos the Al pastor and 2 lengua tacos. The Al pastor taco was okay not my favorite. However, they have the best Mexican style corn. I highly recommend trying it if you want some legit Mexican corn.
