The Original Lindo Michoacan...What can I say, the food is authentic Mexican, with wonderful service. Our table was cleared and ready for the next customer before we had even paid our bill during our most recent visit. The busser kept our ice tea glasses so full I ran out of Splenda trying to keep mine sweet. I may sound like I am complaining or being pissy but I really am not.

 The food here truly is good. I have never had a bad meal and the service is always spot on, but they are so focused on turning over the tables they forget that their customers might like to take longer than thirty minutes to eat dinner. The roving band of musicians can be loud and annoying but it is meant to add to the authenticity. Since I have never been to Mexico I cannot say if the locals wander around singing while people eat or not. 

I had Chicken Enchilada with Mole and my husband had the Coke-Cola Carnitas, I believe. Mine was good. But as usual, his was great. I love that Coke-Cola sauce. It is delicious. The table side guacamole is always a winner, but I prefer my chips to be lighter so while they do a great good I tend not to order it here. If you enjoy the free basket they start you off with, go for the guacamole. 

The Original is just what it says...and there is a reason it has won so many Best of Las Vegas awards. so check it out.
