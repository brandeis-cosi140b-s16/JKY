Loved the complimentary green chile tamale appetizer here!  I also adored the chicken enchilada with green chile cream sauce!!  I especially appreciated the fact that I was able to order this dish NOT fried.  Some venues refuse to alter their menu selections.  Understandable, since many chains strive to stay within national standards, but it's great to find establishments that gladly cater to their customers' wishes!

Even though our first, and only, visit was 3 or 4 years ago, I vividly recall it was a beautiful night, so Mom and I opted to dine in the patio.  It started to get chilly, but we did not want to move inside for the solo acoustic guitarist was delightful playing his Santana covers.  Thank goodness I always keep an extra jacket/sweater in the car for emergencies!

Thank you Jalapeno for a memorable night!
