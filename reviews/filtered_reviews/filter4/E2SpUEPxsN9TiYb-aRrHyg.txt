I went this Monday evening and it was a delight! This was my second time to this establishment Yayo Taco was offering FREE live jazz music to it's patrons. A excellent jazz quintet formed by UNLV alumni were showcasing their talent. It was superb! I have never seen such great talent. The musicians were engaging and amazing in their craft. This talent would give any generic Vegas jazz show a run for their money- easily, It is all free, every Monday night starting at 9pm. 

Bring your date or go with some friends. The wait staff are very friendly and caring. Miguel and his wife work the counter daily I discovered 
The food is a good value. For less than 8 dollars you can get a great meal of Tacos with sides and a fine Mexican beer or soda in a glass bottle. "Hecho en Mexico" 

This is a good value. I caution those who expect 5-star food ingredients in the preparation. The quality of the meats are fair, thus offering better than expected prices. Of course, if they used expensive ingredients, it would be more expensive to you! 

"Que viva Monday jazz nights en Yayo Taco!" The chips and salsa are cheap and delicious.
