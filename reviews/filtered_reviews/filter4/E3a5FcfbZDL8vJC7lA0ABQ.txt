This is one of those places that i think gets a love or hate following, meaning you either love it or hate it and there is little gray area.  For me I really like Chino Bandido.  I think it also depends on your food combination, because you can certainly get a bad food combo.  

First timers need to go up to the bar and get their into to Chino's food tasting.  This is a really good idea and you get a little free food.  The service has always been good and the people who work here have always been really helpful to those that are just a little confused.  

For me I get the Black Beans (YUMMY) and jerk chicken rice, with Emerald chicken and a jerk chicken quesadilla.   I really like this combo, it has a little spice in the quesadilla the beans and the rice and a wonderful cooling ginger in the emerald chicken that really compliments the rest of the dish.  I have strayed from this combo quite a few times but always come back to it as i think its the best combo i have found.  

This is a place that everyone should try.  Its unique and some people will just love the place and some wont.  But do be warned if you do like it, you will every now and then get a little craving and since its the only place that serves this sort of food you will go out of your way to make it there.
