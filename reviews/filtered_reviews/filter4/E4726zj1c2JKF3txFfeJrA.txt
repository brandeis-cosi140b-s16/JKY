We visit this restaurant often.    Visitors from out of town love the atmosphere, especially the ducks.    We were looking for breakfast and wanted to go somewhere different.    We had not tried the brunch and thought it was about time.    The brunch was a good value at $14.95 with a large selection of regular menu favorites and a few added bonuses.    The omelet bar, waffles and fresh fruit were a nice added bonus.    It's a great place to take the kids and grandma.    Enjoy a nice margarita or mimosa with your brunch.
