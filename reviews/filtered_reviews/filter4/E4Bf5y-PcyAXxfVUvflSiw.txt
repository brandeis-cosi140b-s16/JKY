The food is good, yes... But let's take a moment to talk about the tequila.  Oh, the Tequila!  It's seriously top quality!  If you're a fan of this lovely liqueur you need to try the flights they have.  We tried the flight 101 and 102.  Both are great introductions into their infused choices.  

Out of both flights there was a common theme with the three.  One was peppery, one was sweet and one was floral.  Out of the three I LOVED the spicy, peppery one!  I can't wait to go back and order that specific one in a drink! I think I'm going to become an expert on tequila....

So don't make the same mistake I did and come there and not order a flight!  Do it!  You won't regret it, I promise!  Plus you get to snack on some delicious homemade chips and salsa...life's grand!
