Well, we were quite lucky to find this place. In the Phoenix area for our annual Spring Training trip. One in the group said "I want Mexican." Jumped on Yelp and found Los Reyes. 4.5 stars with a boatload of reviews is great. Did not catch the Man v. Food references so that was a pleasant surprise when we arrived (being the food show junkie that I am). Actually tried the same torta that was featured on the show (split 4 ways ... 5 lbs is a lot of torta). I am a torta purist and the the hodge podge was a bit much but in general, tasty. That appetizer was great! Probably would be a 5 out of 5 if I had ordered a more traditional torta ... Who am I kidding, if I am in the area, I'll be back.
