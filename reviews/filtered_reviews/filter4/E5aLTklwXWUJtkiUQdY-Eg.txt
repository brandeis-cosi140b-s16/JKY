Legendary service.  Our waiter killed us with kindness.  And knowledge.  And quick refills.  I don't remember the last time I've had service this good.

The grub was above average.  A little pricey, but not unreasonable.  I think my mole hovered around 17 dollars and I'd absolutely order it again.  Very balanced.

The decor is rad.  At first, I felt like I was walking into a little mission.  Once inside, I found a very comfortable, colorful dining room.

Like Danny said, not much to talk about.  It's not my favorite Mexican restaurant, but it's in the top 10 somewhere.
