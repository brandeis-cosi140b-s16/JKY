First night in Vegas, and we only had 90 minutes and no reservation (on a Saturday night) before we had to get across town for a show.  Diego's was amazing!!  Granted, we were absolutely starving by the time we got to Diego's so anything probably would have tasted great, but the food and service was amazing.

We grabbed a spot at the bar, ordered some drinks and the quac and then split the appetizer sampler.  The complimentary chips and salsa were great!!  I'm not a fan of tomatoes, and usually I avoid all things "pico," but I decided to give it a try and it was great!! Super, super fresh! 

The guac was okay, and that's the major reason for deducting a star.  I like guacamole that has bit of a bite - something... anything tangy... some red onion, a bit of lime, even some cilantro or some salt to wake it up.  Sadly, this one didn't have those things, and if it did, at least it wasn't noticeable.  And this is before we received our super-strong (but so delicious) drinks, so I know my taste buds weren't completely wrecked yet.

The sampler was heavenly!  Everything you want from mexican food - smoky, greasy, cheesy, spicy, and little bit creamy.  I honestly contemplated coming back a few days later on the last night of our trip.  We didn't, but I'd love to give the rest of the menu the next time I'm there!
