I came here after several high end meals, and was craving something basic like a good ol' taco. What I got was yet another amazing meal. The fresh guac was made table side. The chips came out with three different salsas as well as three different flavored salts to compliment them. I made a meal out of the tortilla soup and the birria appetizer. Wow! Great tortillas, great service. Too many tequilas and mezcals to even count.
