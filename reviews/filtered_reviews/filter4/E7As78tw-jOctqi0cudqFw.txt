Taco Tuesdays is where it's at.  $2 for most tacos here after 2pm on Tuesdays (and $5 margaritas!).  I've moved out of Arizona but come back once or twice a year to visit the family.  It's really incredible how downtown Gilbert has expanded and modernized to accommodate so many new businesses.  People actually come here to eat now :o.  It's also awesome to see that the space that Postino and Joyride is in is now finally home to a successful business.

Joyride has delicious Tex-Mex style tacos (my favs so far are the carne asada and the standard), and great service.  The staff is always friendly, and the space is nice and open.  I love how the setup lets you simultaneously eat, watch TV, and take in all that downtown Gilbert has to offer.
