Been here a few times and this place has a Jekyl and Hyde personality which is not necessarily bad if you know each - During the day/early evening its a nice Mexican themed Sports bar/restaurant with a good selection of beers on tap and better than average bar food.  But later at night it takes on a club like atmosphere with a much younger crowd ready and willing to party! Great place though to catch a game on the weekend and they also have a surprisingly large number of  Gluten Free menu items and friendly staff to boot! Can get quite crowded though - However the good places usually are!
