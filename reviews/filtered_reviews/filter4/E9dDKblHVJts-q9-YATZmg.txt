I'm a nacho addict and the ones here are greasy, orgasmic deliciousness. They pile on the toppings, mmmm so good!! I rarely come here because it's a heart attack on a plate but it is GOOD. Oh, and combine it with the Happy Hour 99 cent margaritas. ... Can't really get a better deal anywhere else. The service here is okay ... Not the friendliest service, but whatever ... The good food and prices is where it's at.
