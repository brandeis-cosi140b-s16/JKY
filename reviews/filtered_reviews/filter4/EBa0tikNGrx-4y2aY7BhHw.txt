The place is very nice and the employees were friendly.  I started with a tasty frozen margarita, and the chips and salsa were good too.  My server recommended the tacos because they come on flour tortillas instead of corn.  He also said the shredded beef was best so I got the 3 taco combo with  shredded beef, carne asada, and ground beef.  All 3 were very good but my favorite was the shredded beef, it was the juiciest!  Each taco had a different sauce and there was plenty of meat in each toasted homemade flour tortilla.  The black beans and spanish rice were also delicious.  Of course this is not the kind of place where someone's mexican grandma is cooking in the back so don't expect truly authentic homemade mexican food but you will still enjoy your food.  Everything was fresh and flavorful.  The portion size is perfect and you will leave feeling satisfied but not stuffed like a fat pig lol.   I will definitely go back and I highly recommend the shredded beef.  You can get carnitas anywhere so try something different!
