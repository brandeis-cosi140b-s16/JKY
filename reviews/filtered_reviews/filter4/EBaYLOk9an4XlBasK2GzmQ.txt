--I have visited here four times. The venue is stunning and the serving dishes and utensils set it apart from your average place. 
-- I had always felt eating a taco was a must , but no more! I was tired of walking away over full from three tacos. I had tried all the different varieties and was not disappointed overall. Next time if I get a taco I will try lettuce instead of corn tortillas to save calories and the tortilla is not that stunning. 
--The reason I say "If I order a taco" is because of the grilled Romaine Salad. You can add chicken or steak, but I did not.  I swear the salad tasted just like a steak. Maybe it was cooked just before the lettuce on the grill top. Either way is was delish, This salad is not to be thought of as a side or something to eat because you are on a diet. It stands alone as a meal. Paired with a beer you cannot go wrong. 
--I will also put in a 'go for it' to the street corn. If I came it for a small bite and drinks this corn is the only thing I would order. Outstanding. Two could split if easily if you cut if off the cob. 
--The reason for 4 stars instead of 5? The service. I wouldn't even say i expect fast service, this is a place you want to visit and linger, but constant service would be nice. Four times I have visited and each time service lagged in the areas of taking the order, refilling the drinks and checking back to see if we were done and bringing the bill. I will go back because it is close to family and easy to jump into happy hour. 
--I also recommend the TACO of the day, which is half the price of a menu taco.
