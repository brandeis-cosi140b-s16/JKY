Authentic Mexican food made with quality ingredients in a comfortable setting. Salsa bar has great variety from the usual to ones with strawberry. Munch on salsa and chips while they make your food which does take a little time as it's cooked to order. I like my food spicy but like to counter it with their horchata which is chock full of fruit and pecans. My favorites are the chicken mole and grilled veggie tacos.
