since we were staying @ ti we decided to dine at isla one evening of our trip- and i'm glad we did! we had a reservation (super easy to make on ti's website), which id definitely recommend, as it was pretty busy! we waited about 10 minutes to be seated, but had a nice table. the decor was cute, but the restaurant was pretty loud. 

our server came over promptly and our water glasses were filled quickly. we got guac to start, which was great...i only wish there had been more! we were also given salsa and chips to start, which were good (i liked the green best). all 3 of us got the chicken tinga tacos and enjoyed them alot! the rice served with the dish was a little bit dry, but the black beans were really good. we had margaritas and mojitos with our meals and the drinks were fantastic! overall, everything was super affordable and we had a great time!
