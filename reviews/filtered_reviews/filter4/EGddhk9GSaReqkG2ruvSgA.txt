Had to search for a new place for Mexican cuisine in Vegas.  Usually hit Dos Caminos which has since closed.  Tried Diego at MGM.  Service was awesome.  Prompt start to finish, and our waiter kept us very entertained.  Started with table side guac.  Not that great, needed more avacado.  Dinner was fantastic.  I had the Pork Shank PIbil-style.  Great flavor, perfectly tender.  Friends had fish tacos, and the short ribs.  Both were loved.  Margaritas were classic and tasted great.  Would recommend to anyone with a love for Mexican.
