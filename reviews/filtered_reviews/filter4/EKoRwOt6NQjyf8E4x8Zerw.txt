Even I can't believe that I gave China Poblano 4 stars but I did.  Jose Andres' perverse juxtaposition of Mexican cuisine and Chinese cuisine works.  Who would have thought?

Like many of Jose Andres' other restaurants, China Poblano serves small plates.  Thus it is possible to try many dishes in one sitting.  On my visit, I sampled, among other things, the steamed pork buns, the Queso Fundido, the Shrimp Mojo, the Tuna Ceviche, Cochinita Taco, the Barbacoa Taco, and the Lucky 8 Sui Mai Beef.  

The Queso Fundido, the Shrimp Mojo, and the Cochinita Taco were superb dishes that stood out above the rest.  The Queso Fundido is wonderfully rich, as one would expect, and is accented well by the spicey chorizo.  The Shrimp Mojo had a nice harmony of flavors between the garlic and the roasted poblano peppers.  And, the Cochinita Taco is everything you would hope a slow cooked pork taco would be.  

While the three fore mentioned dishes deserve specific attention none of the dishes I tried were bad.  By mixing and matching between two very diverse cuisines, China Poblano keeps things interesting and should have something that appeals to everyone's palate.
