The shrimp cocktail is amazing! 12.99 medium is huge. Big enough for 3! Tacos are great. Crunchy and soft corn tortilla with melted cheese between the two. The chips are very crispy and fresh. Not too greasy. Got full off the shrimp cocktail couldn't even bite into the shrimp burrito :/ reason for 4 stars is due to the lack of clean tables. I asked the worker to clean the table for me and it was still dirty and sticky. She was very sweet THO.
