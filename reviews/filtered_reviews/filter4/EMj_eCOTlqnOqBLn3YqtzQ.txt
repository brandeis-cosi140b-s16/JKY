This is my favorite 'dirty' mexican restaurant. I say that meaning the type of mom & pop Mexican place you think of with the combo meals that have a variety of things with rice and beans.... not your "upscale" mexican like Cantina. 

Food is always good, and comes out pipping hot! Huge portions, and they have a great little patio area for the nicer weather months! Parking is a little weird though, most of it is back by this sketchy motel.
