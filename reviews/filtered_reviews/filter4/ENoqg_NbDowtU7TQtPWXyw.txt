The margaritas were great, salsa & chips were yummy, shredded beef tacos and tamale were tasty; however, the enchiladas were a bit smothered in cheese.. couldn't really taste them.  Four stars because I haven't been to a good Mexican restaurant in a while... (live in the east coast)... plus the margaritas were really good. Ha!
