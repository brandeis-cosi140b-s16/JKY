If your looking to impress a lady friend this by far has a great atmosphere. However it can be a little noisy weekends so it may be a little difficult to communicate on a date or whoever your company is. The only things I would say is your going to have to pay to really enjoy the Mexican food. It's fine dining Mexican and yes it exists believe or not in Scottsdale. No 2.50 bean burrito is sold here. Anyway I had the soup which was rich and creamy with seafood mixed in but not worth $14. The chips and salsa were tasty and the hot salsa was very good with a kick. Portions are small yet very filling. Another con is the seats are hard and not very comfortable. I saw some people getting they're cell phones out to look at the menu because it's so dark inside. So if you get to dine in the patio do it because it's a great atmosphere. My server was black and very professional he knew the menu hands down and was on top of our table the whole time.
