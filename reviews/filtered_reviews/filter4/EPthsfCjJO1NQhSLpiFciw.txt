I'd give it 5 stars but the drinks are spendy.   Not sure why people are saying the drinks are watered down.  If you like a traditional margarita from scratch that is what it tastes like.  The star is supposed to be the requila and it is.  I even added a shot of grand manier and it was awesome.   The tacos are like 3-4.50 each.  The steak taco's are incredible especially the one with the fried egg.  the staff was VERY friendly.  we were greeted with huge smiles by everyone.  Everyoen is friendly.   there is a queso dip that is not on the menu! I loved it my friend didn't and they even took it off th ebill becasue she didnt.  So service is excellent.  I will go back again for sure.  I already called a friend and said we need to go for happy hour.    Also there is 3!!!! pages of tequila there to add to your margarita or drink straight and there is even oen for $80.  I didnt try it.   I am not sure what the reviewer who spent 175 bucks ordered.  There were 3 of us for lunch and it was 32 after tip.
