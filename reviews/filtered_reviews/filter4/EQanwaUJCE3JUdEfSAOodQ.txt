I live in the area so I stop in or pick up once a month. I have had a good experience each time. I did recently call in an order for pick up and after returning home realized that I didn't get half of my order. I called the next day and they totally made it right. I will continue to patron this establishment for this reason alone. There is something for everyone on this menu as well! The Bloody Mary bar is awesome on weekends!
