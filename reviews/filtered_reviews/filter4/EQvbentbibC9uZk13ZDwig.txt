While the prices are a little high (if it wasn't for Happy Hour, I would have blanched at the prices) the service was very friendly and the food was good. We got three HH plates at $6 each - chicken street tacos, Fuego nachos and the meatloaf sliders.  The meatloaf was a little spicier than I could handle (I'm really sensitive when it comes to hot spices) but the nachos and tacos were awesome. 
Three plates and a margarita came to about $26, with the nachos being the best deal. I wouldn't go out of my way to get here but it's a nice spot downtown.
