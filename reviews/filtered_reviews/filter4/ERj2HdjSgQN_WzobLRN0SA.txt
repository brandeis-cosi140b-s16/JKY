I discovered this place when searching for affordable, decent Mexican food on the strip. My mom and I had been enjoying our fair share of fine dining...so we had lunch here. 

First, it's in Bally's. Poor, old, Bally's. It smells like baby powder and smoke and is a nightmare to walk through. This place is hidden just off the casino floor and across from the first (?) gay dance club on the strip (kudos to you Bally's!). 

It looks like an airport restaurant. 

Staff is surly but charming. They have a little flag on each table, so when you want something, you hoist the flag and they come over to serve you. 

I had delicious red snapper tacos - seriously tasty. We had chips and queso (HUGE portion, too much for us) and my mom had taco truck style tacos. She was pleased. Cheap beer prices for Vegas and you can get your Mexican beer favorites. 

Writing this review has me craving those tacos again.
