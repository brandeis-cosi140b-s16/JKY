They are now doing brunch on Saturdays & Sundays.
The "Avocado Bake"  is absolutely the best brunch item I have ever consumed!
YUM!  

The last time we were there, the portions were less than we thought they should have been;   this time there was enough food per entree to share.
Our server was very attentive, polite and eager to have us enjoy our dining experience.

Go get brunch at Cantina 1511 on Rea Rd. !!
