Consistently rated as one of the top Las Vegas Mexican food restaurants in Las Vegas, Lindo Michoacan offers authentic dishes in a comfortable, inviting and festive atmosphere.  Most nights will find the original location filled with patrons mulling over the hundreds of menu items while listening to an occasional mini mariachi breakout.  

Our party of five did not have reservations for a midweek, 7:00 pm visit, but after a short wait, we were accommodated.
