Went to Javier's with a group of 5. Overall I enjoyed the experience here, even though there were a few low points. The margaritas are good as is there salsa. If I were to complain about anything being overpriced here it would be their guacamole- as it was really pretty bland. As usual I filled up on chips and salsa by the time we ordered our entrees. As a result I didn't order anything special- just a two taco plate. I tried one chicken and one beef. Chicken was the better of the two. Nice crunchy shells that did not immediately disintegrate with the first bite. The surprise for me was the refried beans. Normally I find them to be awful and an unwelcome sight on my plate but the refried beans here were very good. The Chile Negro looked particularly appetizing. The interior of Javier's was very appealing with a cool wood carving on a back wall. Waiter was a bit pushy but efficient. I would like to go back and try some of the house specials.
