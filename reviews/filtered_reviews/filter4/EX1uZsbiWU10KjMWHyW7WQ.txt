Always good service and great food. The salsa is really good and they keep it coming. They have a main red salsa, and three on the side - jalape√±o, habanero some other pepper I can't remember. The habanero has some kick, so watch out. Oh, and the chips are perfectly crisp and warm. Seriously, great chips. 

For food, I always get the tacos. So far I've had almost all of them and have yet to be disappointed. 

The atmosphere is good, not great. Church pews line the exterior with small tables throughout the room. For those who like the outdoors, there is a small patio and I'm told it's great at night.
