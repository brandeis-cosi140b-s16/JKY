This restaurant is in the World Center Market. My girlfriend and I have been twice for lunch while visiting Las Vegas and both times were very good. The location is a little strange but the decor is great. The last time I got the Wagyu steak fajitas that were delicious. The steak was very tender and the flavor with the peppers and onions was amazing. My girlfriend got the short rib enchiladas that were also very good. The biggest surprise was the toasted nachos from the vegetarian part of the menu for our appetizer. They were simple but delicious. The service both times was a little sub par but still worth it.
