I like this place it's good but you have to pick the right food on the menu with the right drinks to go with it. My friend for a Cold corona with Steak tacos and it was delicious!! I wanted that plate lol steak was tender and juicy the tortilla tasted homemade. I got the shredded beef (Barbacoa) burrito and rice and beans with chipotle sauce on top and it was ok. The shredded beef tasted to dry and the pico de gallo they put inside the burrito made the tortilla soggy! :( but it was tasty. 
I also tried the Pineapple Chipotle Margarita and it didn't taste well with the dish I had I couldn't drink it anymore I needed a Cold beer for my burrito. 
The pineapple chipotle Margarita was dry and it tasted like salsa accidental fell inside your drink. It wasn't that good but Im sure if you get something that goes with a margarita it will probably taste better. 
Overall great atmosphere, great music, friendly place, reasonable price... I mean it's Vegas nothing is cheap! I had fun :)
