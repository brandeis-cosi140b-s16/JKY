Recently just moved to the Desert Ridge area....Sandbar has become our favorite "local bar". Although the place is quite large, it has a great casual atmosphere with a friendly staff!
The Happy Hour is great with drink specials and 1/2 price appetizers! The Taco's are muey good!!
Great place to watch your favorite sports teams, plenty of TV's with great views from any seat!
On the weekends, they add in a DJ and a dance floor! 
I love being to throw on my favorite jeans and t-shirt and be able to head out for a night out at Sandbar!
