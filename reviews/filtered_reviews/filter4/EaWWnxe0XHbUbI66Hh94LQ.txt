I have to admit I made fun of my boyfriend's addiction to this place for a long time, but I now understand it.  I have a rather sensitive stomach and a lot the other _____berto's style restaurants have an adverse effect on my digestive system.  While this is not a ______berto's by name, it is of the same style, but I have had no digestive repercussions.  

Oh, and the food is actually good!  The burritos are hefty, the rolled tacos are greasy (but in a good way), the guacamole is tasty and even the fish tacos are yummy.  

This place is cheap, tasty and on my way home from work.  A TRIFECTA!
