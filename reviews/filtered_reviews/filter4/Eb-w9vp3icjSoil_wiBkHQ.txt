My girlfriend and I went yesterday when they opened and sat out on their nice patio. I ordered the cheese relleno and I was very satisfied - one of the better chile rellenos I have had in a long time...lots of cheese and it was large! Refried beans were fine. And the meal came with flour tortillas, which I did not expect. We also ordered guacamole, which was also very good; however, they put tomatoes in their guacamole and I prefer it simply to be avocado and seasonings - I think it is just to add bulk reducing the amount of actual guacamole when any restaurant does that.The server was nice and she also brought me a hotter salsa, since the typical one was not hot enough for me (still good, though). It was good we could sit out on the patio because my friend said the inside smelled like cleaner (which makes sense since they were just opening); and I thought it was stuffy inside. When we walked out back through the restaurant we noticed the music was kindof loud and not appealing in the slightest. Bottom line...sit outdoors and enjoy some very good Mexican food. We didn't have alcoholic beverages, but they had an extensive list of margaritas (no prices for these drinks, so ask.)
