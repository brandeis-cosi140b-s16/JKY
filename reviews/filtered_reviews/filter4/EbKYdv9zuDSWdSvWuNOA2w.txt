Great local mexican restaurant that I always want to find when on business travel.  Not fancy, familyish feel to service, refried and rice style mexican place.   

Chips and flavorful/spicy salsa
I rate all mexican places on rellanos and carnitas.  Here the rellanos were the fluffy style and good.  It came with rice and beans which were very good.   Also ordered a la carte carnitas enchilada & it was great .  Also had their special margarita which was good.  

The one down side was the tortillas - esp the flour that came with the rellanos.  Side of corn I ordered where better, but still not even average.

All in all, for this style of low key mexican place, it was a solid 4.

Adding the following to all of my reviews:  
Way too many undeserved 5 star ratings on yelp.  Ratings should be a bell curve, with at least 50-60% of your ratings a 3.  5 should be another world special, not everyday good.
