After taking in all of the holiday sights downtown we were starving. Mexican food is our favorite so we gave this place a try. It sits above a seafood restaurant in Market Square. We were given a table at the windows which was nice. We could watch the shoppers walking by 
We were waited on immediately. We ordered drinks along with chips and salsa. The chips were tasty and a nice carrier for the salsa. The salsa had a great flavor. 
I ordered the Burrito Cancun. It had steak and shrimp. There was poco, lettuce and sour cream on the side. The hubby ordered chicken enchiladas. He had green sauce on half and red sauce on half so we could try both. His enchiladas came with refreshed beans and rice. 
I took one bite of my burrito and I was in heaven. I'm not sure how they treated or cooked the steak but it packed a big punch of flavor. It was also very tender. It was excellent. 
I tried my husband's enchiladas. I thought I would like the green sauce better but was surprised that I preferred the red. The chicken, like the steak in my burrito, was flavorful and tender. The enchiladas were spicy but you began to have a slow after burn in your mouth. It was the perfect heat. 
We left clean plates and with full bellies. Yum!!!
