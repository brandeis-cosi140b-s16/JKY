Courteous well spoken staff (front and back)

We were there this Monday at 8:30 pm.

The food is very good

I won't mention what food to get because all that we ordered was good.

We will return again.

I didn't like the parking situation. It was too far and too dark when we left the restaurant and feared for our lives
