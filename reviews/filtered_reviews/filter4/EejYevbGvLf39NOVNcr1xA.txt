Mundo is owned by longtime Las Vegas businessman George Harris. Mr. Harris is known for putting his money where his mouth is, taking political stands, backing candidates, launching a better tequila and now, opening Mundo Restaurant in the city of Las Vegas. I mention that it is in the city for locals who'll understand that it would have been easier to be closer to the Strip, in the county but Harris did right by Las Vegas at a time when the city needs all the new business it can get.

As I said, George Harris puts his money where his mouth is your mouth will love him for it. Mundo isn't what you'd call Mexican food, it's really high-end Southwestern cuisine.

Mundo is THE PLACE for locals celebratingt a special occasion and of course for visitors look for  THE BEST LAS VEGAS HAS TO OFFER.
