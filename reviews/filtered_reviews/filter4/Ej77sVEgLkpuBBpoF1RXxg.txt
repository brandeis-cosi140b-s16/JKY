To give you an indication of what I think about this place I was in Phoenix for 3 days for work and I ate here twice.  The first time I had the combo plate with an egg Benedict with a giant piece of great ham and two enchiladas.  I went for both green and red chili which given a choice, why make one.  Had a few beer and then off for hiking.  Two days later on the way to the airport we were batting around a couple places and just decided that this would be much better.  Had the meatloaf which was great and like everything here came in a huge portion with tons of green chili and three eggs.  My wife got the fish sampler which was also really good.  I am not a huge fan of salmon and it was pretty good.  We did not stay for happy hour that starts at 2:30, but it looks really good.
