Juan's is a fabulous Mexican restaurant in Central Phoenix. Hidden near the 51 and Thomas Road in a building that looks like a sports or topless bar, Juan's offers excellent Mexican food with great prices and friendly service.

For under $6 one can order a huge burrito and a large ("small") bag of chips with salsa to go. Even when the spacious restaurant is crowded, there is normally not a long wait to be seated and order. Introduced to this restaurant by a friend of mine who was born in Phoenix, Juan's is now in my "regular rotation" for Mexican food and a place that I like to share with friends.
