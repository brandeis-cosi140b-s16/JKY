"Mexican" and "Brunch". Two words that typically don't go together in my mind. But we saw that they had a brunch menu and thought to give it a try.

We looked at the menu online so we'd know what to have. Unfortunately, the menu we had on this particular day didn't have the "Mexican Toast" so we had one order of the "Smoked Salmon Tacos" and one of the "Carne Asada and Eggs". The tacos were excellent - they had the right amount of salmon and a really good load of eggs and cheese. I especially enjoyed the steak and eggs. It was cooked well, the eggs were poached perfectly.

Parking is an irritant. If you're already in Uptown, hey, great. If not, expect to either drive around the block (yes, even on Sunday) or pay for a garage.
