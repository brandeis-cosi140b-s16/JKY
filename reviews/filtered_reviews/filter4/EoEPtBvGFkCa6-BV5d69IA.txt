Me gusto El Pollo Supremo. 

It's always a sophie's choice between the chicken and the beef...each are equally tasty but I must say that my carnivorous soul favors the beef. Unless my soul is feeling especially gluttenous and I order both. Both meats are grilled to asada perfection, served with flour or corn tortilla, fantastic sweet onions, beans and salsa that I could probably eat an entire bucket of by itself. 
Speed of service is hit or miss, I don't recommend coming here during any kind of football event but most times it is relatively quick. Just sit down and brush up on your spanish with an El Voz or read the College Times. 
The only thing that sometimes prevents me from coming here is that they only take cash, and I'm often far too lazy to go to the ATM. 
But if you have some cash in your wallet and want some good, straightforward Mexican food eat here immediately-you won't regret it.
