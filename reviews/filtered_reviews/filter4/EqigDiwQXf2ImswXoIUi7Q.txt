This was a great place to go to and my husband and I left talking about what we would get next time. That has to be a good sign! 

I tried three tacos: Baja Fish, Crunchy and Chicken Tinga.
The Baja Fish was beer battered and a little soggy, but I ate it last - maybe I needed to eat it quicker? Still good. 
Crunchy had mashed potatoes - YES, MASHED POTATOES - and was so scrumptious. A little on the saltier side but that didn't stop me.

We tried the guac as an appetizer and my husband said it was one of his favorites that we've had at a restaurant - very fresh! Our two sides: Refried beans and corn salsa. Corn salsa was spicier than I thought but still good nonetheless.

The menu has enough of a selection that it could satisfy different cravings but it's not overwhelming with choices, which I liked. I saw things I am looking forward to trying in the future. The prices were pleasantly reasonable, with some tacos starting at $2.80-ish. I had three and that was more than enough for me with the sides.

The decor was really unique and gave it a cool feel. The place looked like it was full and doing well on a Thursday evening when we went. Not too crowded where we couldn't get a table. 

It was too cold outside for me but it looks like they have great patio space. Our server was attentive, helpful with the menu and very friendly. 

I would definitely recommend it to a friend as it came highly recommended to me!
