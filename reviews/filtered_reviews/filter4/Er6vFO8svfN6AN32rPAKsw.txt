I've been to Gallo Blanco several times now and will visit again. Overall I have had good experiences, and the food is yummy as well. I recommend to visit for happy hour and take advantage of the specials. The tacos are delicious, but the servings are small, so HH is definitely the way to go for the price.

I've tried all of their tacos and the carne asada and vegetable are my favorite. The carne asada has an amazing charred, vibrant flavor, and the veggies are always perfectly cooked, not soggy. The fish changes as does the market, and they have been pretty good. I really enjoyed the seared tuna when they offered it. The pork taco is good as well, but the sauce is very sweet so it's not my favorite. The shrimp taco is my least favorite, as it has been over cooked each time I've had it. 

I really enjoy their guacamole - the citrus in it is what makes it! It has a nice mix of sweetness, tangy, and spicy. We have had it once, however, when it tasted completely different and was a little bland. Maybe a different cook?

The service is usually good. Sometimes it's a little slow, which is surprising as the place hasn't been super busy when we've been there, but we also know we've had some servers that were brand new, and they definitely tried their hardest, getting all of our questions answered even when they didn't know the answers just yet. 

Don't miss out on the horchata, either. I believe they make it themselves in house, and it is fabulous! Not too heavy or creamy. Getting one to go is a must on your way out! 

The setting of the restaurant is nice. It's not overwhelmingly modern or artsy - but their furniture and tables are unique. It gets pretty dark in the restaurant once the sun sets and you'll be under candle light. I believe they change out the artwork, since I have seen different things, which keeps it interesting.
