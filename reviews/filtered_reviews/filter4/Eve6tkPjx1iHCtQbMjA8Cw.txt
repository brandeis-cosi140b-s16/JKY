If it's a spring or fall evening and you want to enjoy some above average mexican cuisine, grab a table on the front porch of Cantina 1511.

We went during the week and simply had a plate of nachos and a few beers.  I was starving when we went and had planned to get entrees but thoughts we'd just have a good quality starter.  The nachos feature fresh ingredients and are a large portion.  By the time we ate 80% of the nachos and downed a couple Pacificos, we were stuffed!  It made for a cost effective.  I hadn't been a huge fan of 1511 in the past but that was probably 5 years ago.  I enjoyed this dish and will update my review after my next outing.  So far, I'm going 4 stars... excited to see what else they have to offer.
