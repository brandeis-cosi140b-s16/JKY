Wow.  So, first and foremost, best enchilada sauce ever.  But we'll get to that.  Becky, our server, was not only attentive and sweet, but sent over a little dessert for our anniversary.  Shrimp and chicken tacos for me.  Chicken were superb, shoestring potatoes on top was an interesting touch.  Shrimp were nice, nothing amazing but still very good.  Cheese enchilada to split.  Once again, best enchilada sauce ever.  And I'm not even kidding.  We'll be back for sure.  Regular lime and blueberry margarita.  Traditional lime better than blueberry.  Everything was top notch.  Good service, excellent bussers/server assistants.
