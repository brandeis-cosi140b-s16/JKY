My third time at Leticia's and my third time enjoying the food.  Good number of late lunch customers. I had Birria (beef & goat) for the first time--good choice.  Will try the chicken mole next time.   My friend enjoyed her chicken taco salad. Guacamole could have used a few squeezes of lime.  Our server was Walter--very friendly and upbeat.
