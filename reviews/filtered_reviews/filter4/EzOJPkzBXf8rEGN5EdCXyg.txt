So it helps when you visit this place and  get seated in the main section. The last  time we were here we sat in the bar, and everything was fine. This time we came in with some friends, and sat in the main area. 
We were greeted promptly by the friendly staff. I have to give some credit to our waitress as our group had two english only speakers, one spanish only speaker, someone who was bilingual and a child. Our waitress was able to easily switch back and forth between english and spanish to assist us. 
The salsa has definitely improved since our last visit. The medium was really chunky and the mild had much more flavor. The chips really are incredible here...probably the best I've had it town. Very crunchy, a bit oily but they are also very large. 
I had the taco salad. Its more of a hard shelled burrito than a salad. There is lettuce, but there are more beans and cheese than lettuce. The salad also has guacamole, salsa, sour cream and olives. I had without the meat, but you can get the meat on it. The portion was huge. After indulging in chips and salsa, I maybe conquered half of it. 
This place does have a roving magician/balloon animal artist. He was a little less aggressive than others I've seen, which was nice. 

We definitely had a better experience, and will probably be back.
