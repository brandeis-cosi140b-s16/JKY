The food is definitely just at 3 stars here, but the look and feel of this restaurant, overlooking the faux canals at the Venetian, pushes this place into solid four star territory. 

We had a mediocre chicken ceaser, a taco sampler that was good and filling, and the shrimp burrito that was very good. The best part however, was the cilantro rice. Oh yes. 

The brownie dessert was also rather indulgent and I could have had another.

Service was just ok, our waitress seemed a little timid and checked on us only once or twice, but it was fine, the manager made a round that compensated for it. 

This was the least expensive of our dinners in Vegas, but we enjoyed it thoroughly. It was also a leaner tab as we were done with drinking by that point. I'd go back, but maybe only for an appetizer and a drink. Happy Hour would be good here.
