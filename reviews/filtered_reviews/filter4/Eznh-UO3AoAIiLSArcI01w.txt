Went for dinner but happen to arrive at happy hour. Not all the drinks are on the happy hour menu, but I like beer....found one that was on the happy hour menu. We also ordered the chips and salsa and guacamole...all which you need to pay for. The salsa were good and the chips were hot and plenty, so we didn't mind paying. The fresh made guac was some of the best guac I've had in a restaurant. We ordered veggie tacos and chicken enchiladas. All were very good. I'd of given this place 5 stars, but had to wait too long in between the waiters check ins with us....was ready to go up to the bar to get more drinks a few times.
