The hubby and I love, love, love this place!  

The fajitas are amazing - I have always loved fajitas but hubby was never a fan until we came here!  Now whenever we come here we share the most delicious steak fajitas we have ever had.  What I really love is that you can get grilled veggies instead of rice and beans.  Their pico de gallo and guacamole that comes with the fajitas is fresh and delish too.

I love the grilled jalapenos and onions that come with the delicious salsas and a basket of chips when you come in.

What gives this four instead of five stars is the chips and tortillas - they are not made in-house.  The chips can be on the stale side.  I'm also not a fan of the soup that comes with the meals but no biggie - more room for fajitas!

However the warm, friendly and attentive service more than makes up for store bought chips.  Most of the time Juan himself comes and checks on you and service has always been terrific!  We love this place!
