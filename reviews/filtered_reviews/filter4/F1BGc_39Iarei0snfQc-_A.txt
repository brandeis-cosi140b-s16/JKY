Surprisingly good Mexican food.  I thought it was going to be total white-washed Mexican, but it turned out to be more authentic than expected (not real authentic, though).
I've since been here a few times.  Everything I've tried has been very good.
I'd say the tacos are bit on the small side (not enough to fill me up), but the burrito size is good.
The atmosphere is pretty cool.
They have a travelling 3 piece band that walks around the restaurant and takes requests...everything from Spanish songs to Lady Gaga.

The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that I think it's a bit pricey.  It's not going to break your bank, but it could be a little bit cheaper.
Make sure to get the restaurant.com gift certificate to save a few bucks.
