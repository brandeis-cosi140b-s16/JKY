Hmm, not sure what I've been doing not reviewing these guys.

I first tried them a few months back for the Navajo Taco. It was a bit of nostalgia for me as I had had a really gigantic version of this dish a long time ago on a Grand Canyon tour. The Carlito's version comes in a metal tin (like a lot of their dishes do, apparently) and has a lot of meat (I chose pork verde over carne adovada), shredded cheddar, lettuce, and tomatoes. It was pretty enjoyable, but not enough so that I would go back every day. I haven't felt the urge to try it again yet.

The second time I went was so that I could finally take advantage of their Sunday all-day 2-for-1 breakfast burritos. The basic burrito is scrambled eggs, hash browns, cheddar, and red or green chile for $5.50, but I did the one meat option for $6.50. Yes, that's two for $6.50 at the special price.

I tried all the meats, and chorizo is definitely the best, with bacon a reasonable but not so meaty second and the sausage and ham options not really providing anything special that would make me want to order them ever again. I'm probably going to stock up on 6 of these or so one of these days for an entire week of breakfast burrito-y goodness.

Carlito's is simply a great, cheap local spot for New Mexican cuisine. Try to go at off-peak hours because seating and walkways are really cramped in there.
