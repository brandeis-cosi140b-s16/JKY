We had dinner on a weekday and though it was busy the service was a bit weak. Green corn tamales, and the chicken burro/taco were good. The margaritas were big and pretty good. The guacamole was good but not great. We would go back as the atmosphere and food were better than average. This gets 4 stars because it's in surprise. In central phoenix or Scottsdale I'd be a bit more critical...
