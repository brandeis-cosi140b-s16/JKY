I find that the trick for Barrio Cafe is Sunday brunch.  They have the full menu and a brunch menu.  Arrive at 11 when they open and you won't have to wait for a table.

This is Mexican food the way your Mexican grandma on acid would make it.  Traditional, unexpected and with a few twists.  No cheesy beans and rice here.  No bland, tomatoey enchilada sauce here.  Just delicious goodness brought to you directly from Mexico.

The 'adult bevvies" are delish too.  Sangria, Margs and assorted others.  But they're  not cheap, so don't drink too many!!
