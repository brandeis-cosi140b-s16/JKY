Three words: Filet Mignon Burrito.

Amazing.  The only reason I give this place 4 stars is because the waiter was absolutely worthless... that should tell you something about the food.  If you want gourmet, delicious Mexican food, DO NOT SKIP THIS PLACE.  Even the chips and salsa are amazing.

I came on a groupon, and service was so bad, I didn't stick around to see the waiters face. I left groupon, and a sliver of a tip on the table.
