In the area visiting and wanted Mexican food.  Reviews were good therefore gave it a try.  At first, the place was not what I expected.  Instead of being seated and served, you order at a counter and wait for a number to be called.  

We ordered cheese crisps - a baked flour tortilla with melted cheese - essentially an open face quesadilla.  It was very good.

We ordered tamale, enchiladas (red chile), carne asada and green chile tamales. All were good except the asada was a little dry.

We finished with sopapillas with honey.  These were very good as well.  I wish we could find these in California.

Overall,  the food was good to very good. Four stars due to the dry carne asada.

Large portions of food and fairly priced.
