Decided to go to Sonora Mesquite Grill for lunch for the first time today and boy and I sure glad I did. The food was super fresh and the restaurant was very clean. 

I decided on the Taco Combination Plate which included two tacos, rice and beans. I ordered cardne asada taco and babacoa Taco on flour tortillas. It also came with a side of two different salasa. One was a smoked green Chile mixture and the other was a thing green sauce. Both had a ton of flavor. The tacos came with two tortillas as that is pretty standard to tacos like these but since they were so full of meat I separated them into 4 tacos! It was perfect. 

The place wasn't crowded as it was myself and just one other diner in there at lunch. 

I will certainly recommend this little place to anyone looking for great tacos.
