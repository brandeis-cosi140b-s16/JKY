The salsa is really good. I liked mixing the tomatillo (medium) with the hot salsa on the chip. Gives it a smokey, sweet flavor.
For my entree I had the Pescado Verde. Very flavorful fish dish. 
I highly recommend eating on the patio. There are fire pits, water features and fun Mexican decorations.  Very secluded with plenty of shade.
