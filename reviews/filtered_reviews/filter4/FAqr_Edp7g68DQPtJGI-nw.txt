Yummy.

Green chili chimichanga enchilada-style is the way to GO. I got the plain green chili burro and was basically making my own enchilada-style with the sauce, guac and other toppings from my boyfriend's plate. It was amazing. 

You pay extra for the enchilada-style, for guac, for cheese and even for extra hot sauce (it's homemade). Though still not expensive, the pricier your meal gets, the more delicious it gets. It's worth a bit more to add extra flavor to the burros, which I actually thought was rather plain without my doctoring.

Rito's is a cash-only take out place with some picnic tables outside, and at lunch time it was hopping with people. The only negatives I can see are that it's set up sort of like a bank teller, so you feel quite disconnected to the staff the whole time. I also couldn't find the bathroom to wash my hands after my messy food, nor could I find any extra napkins.
