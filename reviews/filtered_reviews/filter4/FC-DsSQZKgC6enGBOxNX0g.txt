Food, atmosphere = 5 stars. Service = 2 stars.  Fabulous happy hour on the patio. Combined with their guacamole, this was a very satisfying and enjoyable experience. The waiter seemed a bit miffed that we didn't order hundreds of dollars worth of alcohol (my buddy only had two drinks) and even cleared our food before we were finished. I understand trying to turn a table, but come in!
