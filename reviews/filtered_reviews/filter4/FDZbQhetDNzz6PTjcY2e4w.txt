Came here yesterday with a girlfriend for the $2 taco Tuesday special. We were seated quickly and before we got settled at our table we had chips and salsa placed on our table (which was amazing!) I ordered a mango margarita that was oh-so-good. I ordered 3 tacos: 1) Fish taco was my least favorite. It was fresh tasting but seemed it needed more seasoning. Probably better fried. 2) Beef taco was good. Typical. 3) Chicken red chile taco was great! The grilled onions and spicy sauce made the taste even more complex and tasty. The only downfall with service was that our waiter made us feel a little rushed to leave near the end of our meal. Outside of that, overall good experience. I'll definitely be back. But probably only for the taco Tuesday as the prices seem a little high to me for Tex-Mex cuisine.
