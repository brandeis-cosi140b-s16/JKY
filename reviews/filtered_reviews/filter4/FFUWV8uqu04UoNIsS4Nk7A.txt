We have dined at this upscale Mexican restaurant numerous times over the years, but this was the first time for weekend brunch.  We met friends at the entrance and were soon seated in an enclosed patio.  We were provided menus and were
soon sipping bottomless mimosas.       

Our waitress and her trainee brought us plates of fresh fruit with a sweetened citrus sauce (4 Forks) and guava empanadas. I was saving my appetite for the "good" stuff so I only took a single bite of an empanada, which turned out to be very good.  Our waitress encouraged each of us to order 2 items on the first round with mine being Peruvian shrimp and grits (3 Forks) and short rib hash topped with an egg (4.5 Forks).  In the meantime, we requested another round of mimosas.  

For the second round I ordered a bacon jalapeno PBJ which is suppose to be a signature dish that I found to be just okay.  I also shared an eggs Benedict which was better.  I closed out my meal with a thimble sized portion of rice pudding.  

My 3 table mates ordered a variety of other dishes with the huevos rancheros, bread pudding French toast and the breakfast enchilada garnering the most praise.
