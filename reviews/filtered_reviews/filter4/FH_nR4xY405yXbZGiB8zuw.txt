I've been here a few times, it's an interesting mix of Mexican and Chinese.  Some of the items are really hit or miss.  

The last time we went we sat at the bar and Sarah schooled us on tequila, that girl is full of tequila knowledge, some really interesting stuff.  We had a few tequila flights, very interesting taste testing.  

The caldo tlalpeno wasn't that good had a odd flavor.  The 20 vegetable fried rice ($19.88)was just ok, until I added monk sauce($2.88), it added some flavor to it. The rou jia sandwich was pretty good, the pork was very sweet tasting.  Now the shrimp mojo, looked bad, but was very good.  

Would I suggest this place, boy that's a tough one, the menu is such a mine field, maybe I would and suggest sticking to the tacos and tequila.
