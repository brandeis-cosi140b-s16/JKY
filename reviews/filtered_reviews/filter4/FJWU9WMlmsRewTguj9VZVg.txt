I like this place and really want to go back sometime but no one seems to want to go to sit down restaurants anymore. What's happening to this world?

So I tried 2 tacos and the guac and chips when I was there last. A bit pricey when you're hungry for more but don't have the cash. Atmosphere is awesome. Sat in front of the bar so you get food right out of the kitchen. Very delish!
