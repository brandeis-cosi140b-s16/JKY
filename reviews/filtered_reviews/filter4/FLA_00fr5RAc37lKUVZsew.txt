My wife and I both had the shrimp and beef fajitas that comes with a side of refried beans, sour cream, guacamole, pico de gallo and flour tortillas. It was awesome and cooked just right! We were more than pleased with AJ's excellent service for our party of 11. The only downside was the patio that could use some daily cleaning. We'll be back!
