Food was good. We did the 3 tacos for $10. They are the small street tacos though.
I can't eat much in 1 sitting and I still didn't feel full after my food was gone.
The salsa brought out with chips before you meal is really good! The guac looked amazing also!

I would go back but would probably order something different. I love tacos but $10 is pretty steep for the amount of food you get!
