Service was great, had appetizers at the bar. Chips and salsa good, margaritas were great. They had an awesome band playing until midnight on Sat. Good place to just hang out listen to music have a drink. The band that played last night played alternative rock, was told they will be back on Thursday can't wait to see them again.
