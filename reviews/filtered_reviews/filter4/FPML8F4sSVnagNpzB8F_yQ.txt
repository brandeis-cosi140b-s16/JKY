I got a recommendation to come here from the hotel I was staying at because the margaritas are supposed to be good. So, during a break from the conference I was attending, my friend and I came here for happy hour. 

I got my typical margarita - mixed berry. It was pretty strong but still really tasty. 

Our bartender recommended we get the dips to snack on as we chatted and drank our margaritas. The queso and the bean dip were both really good, and my friend really enjoyed the guac (which I'm not a huge fan of in general). 

If I wind up back in this area, I'd definitely try out this place again on the sole fact they can make a solid margarita.
