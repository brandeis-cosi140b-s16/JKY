The fresh salsa bar is the featured attraction.  20 - 30 types daily with differences nearly every day.  The food is great-to-fantastic.  Decor is nice and the space is small and tight.  Don't expect table service - go to the counter, order and pay.  They will bring you your food.  If you are looking for white linen napkin experience, go to The Barrio.  If you want some of the best salsa and tacos in town - come here.
