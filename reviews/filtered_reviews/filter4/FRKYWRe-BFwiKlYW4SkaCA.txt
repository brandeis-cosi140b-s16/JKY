A great place to check out if you happen to be simultaneously craving Korean food and Mexican food. It's a small restaurant with decent fusion menu items. Came here the other night about 30 minutes until closing so I was a bit nervous about how we'd be treated and the quality of the food. Once we arrived,  however, we were welcomed with all smiles and my worries were gone. The service was awesome. Our orders were taken and brought out in promptly fashion. 

We ordered two plates of Kimchi Fried Rice (spam and beef bulgogi) and being a such a sucker for kimchi anything, I loved both. I prefer a little more of a spice factor, but it was still delicious. I also had the Fushion Tacos; one beef bulgogi and one pork belly, which were also quite tasty. The meats were well-seasoned (not too sweet or salty) and cooked to perfection. They were also very generous in filling the tacos. Whoop! Regardless of being close to closing time, all of our dishes were made fresh, which definitely made our experience with the food so enjoyable. I'd recommend any of their fusion items and most definitely the kimchi fried rice! Yumm.

If you're in the area and looking for tasty Korean-Mexican fusion with good service, check this place out!
