KICKASSSSS MARGARITAS!!

This is THE place to go for margaritas in the area (near downtown)!  Come grab a pitcher or 4 of the Kickass Margaritas with some friends and enjoy some delicious appetizers as well!  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=2z1vI-CXPyMHEMntTszyWg&userid=F28n26ynklEioZDInyK__A) 

I came here with a few clients to unwind a bit after a long day of work and it was so relaxing that didn't want to leave!  We sat in the outside seating area -- cute, but full of random decor -- I thought I walked into Guadalajara, lol  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-dos-molinos-phoenix?select=mOqppqoOhfgIncilkMVGJg#_5myU5HjdcHdwvbDArXbZg) 

We ordered a couple appetizers/entree to share along with our margaritas:

(They serve complimentary chips and salsa-- I loveee the homemade salsa, especially because it is spicy! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-dos-molinos-phoenix?select=mOqppqoOhfgIncilkMVGJg#hJpJSd1U3xGYs927JX1wJg))

- Adovada Ribs: Country style pork ribs marinade in red chili, served with rice and flour tortilla.  This is SPICYYY!  If you can't handle spicy, you probably won't eat more than a couple bites of this.  I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy food and I even thought this was pretty hot.  The pork was fork tender and the homemade flour tortilla was delicious.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-dos-molinos-phoenix?select=mOqppqoOhfgIncilkMVGJg#AvtkP_Po96waiz-8dDgtUQ)

- Chorizo Pizza: This too, was VERY SPICY!  Delicious, but I was for sure sweating after a few bites!  I love how the pizza is thin, and the crust is nice and crispy!  I'd say this is more like a giant tostada with a generous amount of spicy chorizo.  I would order this again!
