Delicious and inexpensive Mexican food!  Fausto's is similar to Roberto's taco shops, but for some reason... their food tastes a little bit better!  I especially love the bar filled with salsas and different yummy things.  I always wondered why cucumbers were a part of the bar area until my friend taught me to put them in a bag with salt, lime juice and salsa.  So good!
