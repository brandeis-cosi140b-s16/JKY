I like Cantina Laredo's slightly different take on Mexican... love the seasoning on the Cascabel Rib-eye. Good margaritas and chips & salsa. 
The guacamole made table-side is really good too. The Mexican brownie is a fun indulgence - on the rare occasion I'm not stuffed from dinner. The service does vary more than I'd like... but is normally OK. 
The salad prices are getting a bit ridiculous, but otherwise prices are reasonable. The atmosphere is nice... normally less crowded or noisy than nearby restaurants. On the few crowded visits (nearby events, snowbirds, Valentine's weekend) the waits have been short.
