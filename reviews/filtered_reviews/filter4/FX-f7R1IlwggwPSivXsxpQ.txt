1st visit to this place today for lunch.  I ordered the signature "Carlito's Burrito" because it indicated it came with double meat and no beans or rice.  You can choose the meat and choose red or green sauce.  I chose to try chicken with red sauce.  I also ordered mine smothered ($1 additional) and with jalapenos.  The burrito was HUGE, and was packed with chicken and sauce.  I love that they covered my burrito with so much sauce that I had pools of it to use however I wanted.  For this size of burrito the price was pretty good.  I would say cheaper than most similar mexican places.  The sauce also had a good spicy kick to it.  My only complaint at all from this visit is the size of the seating areas.  It gets a little crowded as it was at lunch time and I bet it's even worse during school days with a High School right across the street.  Not a lot of room to sit, but cannot complain at all about the delicious food and the good service.
