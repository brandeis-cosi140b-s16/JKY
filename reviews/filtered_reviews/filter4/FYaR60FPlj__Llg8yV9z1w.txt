After a couple days of buffet & casino food, bf and I were looking for a nearby spot for lunch that offered something a little different. Thank you, Yelpers for leading us to Nacho Daddy, right off the beaten Fremont Street Experience path.

I'm kind of wavering between 3 & 4 stars here, service was lacking, but the food was good. 

The place feels a little divided, with the bar & bar dining on the other side of the wall from a more open, "brunchy" feeling dining area. We sat away from the bar but I wish we hadn't, it was much livelier over there!

The menu offers tacos, burritos, chips, guac... I honestly didn't look over it too long because we found what we wanted right away. We split the guacamole, chicken street tacos and pork burrito. Everything was very tasty and reasonably priced.

Our server was a bit inattentive, forgetting things here and there, taking awhile on the drinks, etc. We weren't in a big hurry though so it wasn't a huge deal.

Glad we stopped by!
