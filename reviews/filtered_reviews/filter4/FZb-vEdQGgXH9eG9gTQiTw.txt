Great place for lunch. Been here a couple of times and I've never been disappointed. Iced Tea with the giant Green Chile Burro. WOW. Place is family friendly, priced perfect, and the service was excellent. Lunch never takes too long and the atmosphere is fun and relaxed. They really make you feel like you're part of a new family here.
