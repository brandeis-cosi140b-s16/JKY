This place gets four stars because:

1. VEGAN OPTIONS- nachos, tacos, burritos, salads on point. 
* I believe they use daiya cheese which is not my fave but acceptable :)

2. Great Service- I came in with my boyfriend expecting only him and I to be eating, I received a call that four other people were coming to eat with us. On the very busy night we went the waitress finagled us a table! This was highly appreciated.

3. Waitress(es) took chips and salsa off of our bill due to the business and semi-slow service, again much appreciated

4. The only thing that irked me was the lack of space! Nacho Daddy needs to expand that location. 

All in all I had a great time
