Solid choice for Mexican food, friendly service.

I came to Habanero's on a date, as a quick place to eat before going to do something else. It was perfect for that purpose.There was plenty of seating, so we got a table immediately. When I first walked in, I thought that the setup of the place was such that you order up front, but it was a full service meal. The kitchen is open, so you can see what's cooking back there.

The service was friendly, the restaurant was clean.

As for the food, I was pretty impressed. We ordered the parrillada for 2, so we got a really good mix of what the place has to offer. The meal comes out on a plate for the guacamole, sour cream, beans (of which you have a choice of refried or black), and rice and a little grill for all of the meat. And there was a lot of meat! There was chicken, chorizo, steak, and carnitas on this plate. You also get your choice of tortillas (corn, flour, or wheat). On both the tortillas and the beans, we got to choose separately, so we had some corn and wheat tortillas.

The meat was all great! Juicy and tender, it all made for good tacos. Add a little guacamole and some of the salsa, and this is some tasty food.

I'll definitely come back, and I'll likely find it difficult to order something other than the parrillada. It's a great option!
