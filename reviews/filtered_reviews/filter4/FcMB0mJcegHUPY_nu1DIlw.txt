The Cabo shrimp tacos were amazing.  The shrimp is fried in beer batter.  It was crisp and delicious.  They have a Salsa bar of over 15 different homemade salsas to choose from. The pico de gallo was my favorite. Everything was fresh and well prepared.  There isn't a lot of room inside, so call ahead if you have a big group.
