We have been eating here for over 20 years.  This is a order at the counter kind of place and the food is quite good.  The veggie burro is a favorite for several in our family, and of course the cinnamon crispies disappear off the table very quickly.  The wait staff is always friendly, and the whole place has a family atmosphere, and people who eat here are just friendly.  Mary Sanchez helps with the tables and cleans up and always makes you smile she is so enthusiastic.   I see others complaining in these reviews that it is a gringo place, but the cooks are not, most of the wait staff are not and and most times at least half of the customers are not.

We have  several Mexican food places we like, and Mexican food is a little like love, it's in the eye of the beholder.  This is just good family food, nothing fancy.
