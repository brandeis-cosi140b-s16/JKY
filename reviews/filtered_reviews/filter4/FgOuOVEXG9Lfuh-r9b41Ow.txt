I can't tell you the number of times that I've wanted to partake in happy hour but the bar tables are all taken while the rest of the restaurant is nearly empty and the hostess looks at me with an awkward smile.  Annoying.    

Such an occasion happened earlier this week and the hostess promptly grabbed the happy hour menu and seated us a table-table.  High points for that one.  

Drinks are delicious and I highly recommend the cucumber jalapeno margarita.  They bring a neat little array of sauces and spices for the chips.  My vampire taco was delicious.  

Great experience and I will definitely return!
