Me and my wife come here all the time for some good mexican food! They are like the fine dining of mexican food. The avocado appetizer is the best I've ever had at any mexican restaurant. Part of the reason its so good is the experience; they actually make the appetizer in front of you! Another good feature of this place is the live music. Theres an amazing guitar player/singer who sings a lot of classical mexican tunes. The reason I gave this a 4 out of 5 is due to the small and inconvenient parking lot, especially since they're usually always busy. Second, the last time we went there we were COMPLETELY ignored. We had to find the manager twice in order get our food ordered and delivered. 30 minute wait is unacceptable, especially when no one checks on you. That is what cost them a perfect score. Other than that, a very good meal awaits for you here.
