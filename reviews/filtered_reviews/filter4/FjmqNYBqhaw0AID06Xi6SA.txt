I'm always super skeptical of fusion foods, because they usually don't turn out that great... but KoMex is definitely an exception. The service is noticeably wonderful and I like that they have both tables and bar seating. 

The food portions are huge, especially for the price. I ordered the Bulgogi Rice Bowl ($8) which has bulgogi, rice, KoMex slaw, jalapenos, kimchi, lettuce, a fried sunny side up egg, and this spicy sauce. It was filling and the amount of spice was just right. Of course there is a rack of hot sauce for the more daring diners.

This happens to me a lot... but my friends usually order something better than what I have. Apparently for a limited time only, KoMex is serving Bulgogi Tater Tots ($9) which are tater tots topped with bulgogi, pork belly, bacon, sour cream, tomatoes, green onions, cheese. Best late night meal you can possibly ask for. Anyone who loves potatoes will be floored by the Bulgogi Tater Tots, so give them a try before they're off the menu!

There are so many great options on the menu, all of them with raving reviews on Yelp, so I can't wait to go back and try more.
