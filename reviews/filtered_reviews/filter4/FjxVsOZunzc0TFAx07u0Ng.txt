This place was pretty good. Actually the best part about it was the staff. They are VERY enthusiastic about what's going on, and very attentive to what you need. 

I had the nachos and a taco. Let's start with the nachos:

The only reason I cant give this place 5 stars is because there are a LOT of bare chips on the pile of nachos they bring you. In fact, when I received it I was quite surprised to discover how many NOT covered chips there were. They could have done away with about two thirds of the chips, but they basically use the chips as a way to present you with a pile high plate, even though the good stuff is not as plentiful as it could have been. Still delicious. Just not as "Oh my God" as I was lead to believe.

Now for the taco:
I had the barbacoa taco - Now this deserves the "OH MY GOD!!" It was DELICIOUS!! In fact, I wish I had ordered a couple more and NOT gotten the nachos. The meat was seasoned PERFECTLY!! And the tortilla was a thick one, that had been slightly grilled and delicious.

A good time was had and it was a really fun place right off of Freemont street.
