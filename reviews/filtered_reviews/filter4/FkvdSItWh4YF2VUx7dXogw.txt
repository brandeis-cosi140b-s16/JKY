Found this place while road tripping through Vegas on Yelp's best of 2015. We sat at the bar to avoid waiting 30 minutes for a table. I love that this upscale Mexican restaurant uses non-GMO, organic ingredients. The Mexican street corn and table side guacamole were both top notch. We were served ice water and a trio of fresh salsas and chips upon sitting down. The veggie salad left something to be desired with a small portion size and overly sweet dressing. Ordered the flan with the yelp check in offer and it was some of the best I've ever had. Our service was excellent. I'd come back.
