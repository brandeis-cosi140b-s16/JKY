2nd visit - returned upon request of the gracious owner Terry.  Had a carne asada taco and bean burrito.  

I have to say my vision of carne asada previously was narrow.  Down home carne asada from the streets was all I knew.  America's Taco Shop has broadened my carne asada horizons for the following reasons:

_Carne asada can have quality, proper cut, and flavor.  It can taste leaner, less greasy.
_Refried beans can be free of lardo and theirs are some of the best I've ever had.
_If you use a good tortilla to wrap their tacos and burritos, it's a sign you care.
_While the expected accompaniments may not be present, who doesn't love caramelized onions and lettuce on a taco.

SO, lets take America's for what it is..a slightly upscale carne asada experience.  

Yes, you will pay up more dough for less during this experience, but its one that needs to be had.  I will be back to America's because there will come a time when I want a more quality, lean, cleaner meal, which we all know you can't get on the "streets".
