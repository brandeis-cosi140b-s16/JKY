Their meat is really flavored good here, they will give you a sample if  you ask of the chicken, steak and pork. My favorite is the pork but the chicken and steak are good too. I have tried the bowl with pork and the steak burrito. The pineapple verde sauce is good, it's different from the normal green verde sauce but different in a good way. The coconut bark is like crack addicting so do't go there or you'll be fiening for it in a bad way, you were warned. Always check in for the Yelp deal, that's what got me addicted to the coconut bark.
