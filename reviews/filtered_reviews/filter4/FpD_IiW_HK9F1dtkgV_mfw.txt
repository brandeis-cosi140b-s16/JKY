Los Olivos Norte is the North Scottsdale outpost of the original, located in Old Town.  This is your basic, everyday (American) Mexican food place.  Fajitas, combination platters, chips & salsa, etc. etc.  While Los Olivos Norte is not going to blow your socks off, it is good, typical Mexican food.  I give it four stars because I am a Mexican food addict.  If you do a good job (and they do), I'm going to be a fan.

The service here is QUICK.  Chips and salsa (plus a free bean dip!) came out immediately.  They were quick to take our order and the food was out, fresh and hot, about 10 minutes later.  Again, the food isn't going to change your life, but it is tasty and does the job.
