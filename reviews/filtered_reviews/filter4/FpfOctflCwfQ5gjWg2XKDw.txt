The food here is really good... All of their courses... Their chips and salsa is amazing.  I have been here a couple times and have gotten their house special both times... A chicken burrito like dish.  It is really good and prepared well... My only knock on this place and keeping it from truly getting 5 stars is that I wasn't impressed with the quality of chicken used.  I don't want to sound like a snob or anything but if they used white meat chicken breast I'd come much more regularly.  The fried ice cream is to die for.  The service can be a little slow on busy days but they are always friendly.. I'll be back!!
