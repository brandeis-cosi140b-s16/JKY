As far as chain mexican food, Abuelos has to be the best. I always get the same thing there, two enchiladas both with the con carne sauce and papas and rice. The con carne sauce is delicious. Also, their salsa is interesting and has a decent amount of spice to it. The papas are like mexican mashed potatoes and they are very tasty. In addition, all of the food is very fairly priced. I would choose Abuelos over one of those other overpriced bland mexican chains any day.
