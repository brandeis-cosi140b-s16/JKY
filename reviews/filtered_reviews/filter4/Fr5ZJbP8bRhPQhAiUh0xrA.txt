I've got to say that this is a top Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas.

I drive by there once in awhile and it is always packed, so I stopped by for some lunch one day.

The place is nice inside.  It has a large bar and different dining separated areas so it  has some private and quaint booths and tables.  The service was excellent.  The waiters were fast but not in a hurry.  

The food.  It was eleven in the morning so I felt like breakfast.  I had some eggs with shredded beef and my friend had the flautas.  It was all good.  I don't think it is authentic Mexican food, but it is quality Mexican food as the masses know it.  

I do want to go back at dinner time and try some more items on their menu to get a better idea for how good the food is.
