I was pleasantly surprised with how good the food is here. I had heard mixed reviews, so I was sketchy on trying it out. I went with a large group of friends and started out with a variety of different appetizers. The guacamole and queso dip with chorizo were bomb!! Yeah the tacos are pricey, 3-5 dollars but honestly that's any price for a taco in the central-downtown phoenix area. I ordered the standard taco and also the crispy fish taco. Both were good. (crispy fish was my favorite) My boyfriend ordered the chicken torta and that was tasty and flavored very well. The pineapple aguas frescas with tequila was definitely a good choice too. Staff was friendly and attentive. Overall, I had a great experience and I will be back!!
