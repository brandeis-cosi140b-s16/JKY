Pretty good place! We went here after seeing the line and the wait for Spice Buffet, especially in respect to closing time; and P.F. Changs also having a wait.  Turns out Yolos was a good choice.  There was no wait, plenty of tables, nice atmosphere despite practically being in the casino and fast service.

The Tortilla soup was great. The mahi tacos were ok and the chicken fajitas were decent. I'd give the food three stars. The service was phenomenal and courteous; and very timely. Our food came hot and fresh, and a bit faster than we were ready.

It's not a bad place to try out. It isn't cheap, but not many places in Vegas are. It's not that expensive either.
