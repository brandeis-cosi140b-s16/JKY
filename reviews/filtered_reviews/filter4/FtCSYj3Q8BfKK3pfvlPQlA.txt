I have eaten at the one in Kingman, the food seemed the same, but the atmosphere at this one is much better.  Overall, its pretty good, I had the El Padrino, its kind of like beef fajitas rolled into a burrito with cheese on top...My wife had the Mexican Flag, I didn't try it, but she said it was also good.  They bring huge glasses for your soda, or water, or whatever, this I love as I tend to drink a lot, then have to wait for the server to refill my glass.  Before your meal they bring out beans, and two kinds of sauce, a hot and a mild.  The beans were OK, the mild sauce was a little sweat, and the hot sauce, while not that hot, had a good flavor.  We also tried their Creme Brulee, again pretty good.  On top of these things was the service, very very good, which to me is a huge part of the meal.  I would definitely go back.
