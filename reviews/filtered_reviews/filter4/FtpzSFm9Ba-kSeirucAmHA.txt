Came here for dinner on a Tuesday night - sat at the bar.  We ordered chips and salsa and was surprised that we were charged for it.  Guess that's Vegas. Also ordered some fruit mojitos which were delicious. The food came out before the chips and salsa. I had the cheese enchiladas and my friend got the chicken nachos. Both were pretty tasty. Overall a good spot - pricey for Mexican, but that's just Vegas.
