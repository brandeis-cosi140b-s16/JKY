I came here for the first time last night and I was lucky enough to meet two friends in the parking lot.  They led me through the process and made it easy for a Taco y Taco newbie to order what I wanted.

The staff was super friendly and I soon had two tacos--one al pastor and one of their Vampiro.  I also got an elote--the first time I've had this at a Mexican restaurant.  I am a fan of this street food for sure.

The tacos were good.  I got everything on the al pastor and the pineapple tends to overwhelm the rest of the taco.  I also dumped a fair amount of their hottest salsa on, so tasting for details wasn't too much of an option.  I got the Vampiro with carnitas.  The server grabbed a large piece of pork that was simmering in some nice juices and sliced away to put in the Vampiro.  This was very tasty and I'm glad I got it.  As for the elote, I really am a fan.  The cotija and then dusting with Mexican chili powder make for a great taste combination.

Last night was Mariachi Monday and there was a Mariachi band playing in the foyer and just inside the restaurant for about the first hour I was there.  It did make conversation a bit difficult but it added to the atmosphere.

The restaurant has a partial second floor which gives you more options for sitting.  However, when you forget something, like getting a drink and some plastic utensils, it's down the steps and back up again.  Better to get your hunger on a bit more.

As I said before, the staff was really great!  They'll ham it up and pose for any photo op you want and they are helpful in answering any questions.  The ladies at thew register were just the same.

This really was a good stop for tacos.
