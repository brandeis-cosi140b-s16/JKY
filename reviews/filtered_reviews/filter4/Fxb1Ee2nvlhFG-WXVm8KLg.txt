The food was really good.  I got the Tako Tacos.  Octopus was perfect texture and just enough sauce and accompaniments to lend to the main event, but didn't overpower.  The guac was super fresh and really tasty.  I wanted an Amstel Light (don't judge) which they didn't have, but the waiter recommended the Lucky Buddha Ale and it was money.  Way better than that Amstel Light would have been.  Good atmosphere, but tables in the bar are a tad close together.  Everyone was very friendly though!
