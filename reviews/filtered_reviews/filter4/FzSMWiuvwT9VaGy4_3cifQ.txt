Valle Luna is a Mexican restaurant with multiple locations throughout the Phoenix area.

I would put Valle Luna in the above average Mexican food restaurant category. The food doesn't isn't close to having the authentic flavor, however if you know that going into it, you're going to enjoy your meal.

I love their appetizer list, which includes mini tacos, mini burritos, a tasty Mexican pizza, and more. If you're looking for a meal, the chimichanga, fundido, or Pepe's sizzling fajitas are all good choices. 

I love going to Valle Luna for happy hour. They have daily drink specials, half price appetizers, and a nice little lake to sit next to. 

Above average food, friendly service, and a great happy hour gives Valle Luna an above average rating of four stars.
