Why is it only cows get two stomachs - what was god thinking?

I could have used another one last night after taking down those first two chicken tacos, but being the conservative diner I am, I stopped at five so my fellow diners wouldn't think I'm a hog. I'm glad I did too.

A fine selection of Mexican beer and a pretty waitress managed to do their handiwork after the dozen or so pints just sort of snuck-up on me. That's when I started ordering tacos like judgment day was fast approaching.
It was about this time I started thinking how handy it'd be to have two stomachs; the first to process the beer and the other for tacos n' shit. Jesus, I would have cleaned 'm out of tacos last night.

The chicken is charred black and tastier than all hell. The corn tortillas were above average with a slight sweetness. The salsa was weird, but fuck it, the tacos were tasty enough on their own.

Anyhow, fuel eating doesn't play here. It's either sport or feelings, pick one.
I did both but I'm paying for it today, farting all nine musical octives.

If my sphincter was a bit tighter, I could probably hit high C.
