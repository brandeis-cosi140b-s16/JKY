I hadn't been in probably 10 years so I didn't really remember what it was all about, just that I'd enjoyed it before and people always talk about how they love it.

So when my husband and I were in the area and in need of some quick food Sunday afternoon we headed over.

The guy at the counter was so incredibly genuine and nice. He helped us with the order form which for whatever reason is a bit confusing. I love the different combinations you can make. I didn't get too adventurous this time, I was a little overwhelmed, but I'd go back and try it again. I loved my husbands quesadilla with machaca.

It was totally worth a visit.
