One thing that I love about Emiliano's is the serving sizes. I am a pretty hefty eater, but I know that when I go here I will leave with a full stomach, and sometimes even some leftovers.

The prices are pretty good. Upon glancing at the menu one might think that they're a little high, but for the amount of food you get, it's a good price.

The food is also pretty good. I've never really had anything I didn't like, and I've tried the tacos, flautas, burritos, arroz con pollo and more. Then again, I've never had anything that's completely wowed me either, which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars instead of 5.  

Overall, Emiliano's is a nice restaurant with some buena comida.
