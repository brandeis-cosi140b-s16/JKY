I am a fan. This small taco shop that is family owned is just the right kind of place to go for lunch for some fast very good Mexican food. Don't go in thinking that its going to be a sit down place that will serve you. This is more like a indoor food truck. the food is fresh all the ingredients were fresh as well. No you don't get chips and salsa as you would expect from a food truck kind of place. The burritos are very tasty and large. If their burritos don't fill you up then you need to go to a buffet and just pig out. I will go back for sure and order the tacos (they street tacos so yes they are the small ones) they are soooooo good. And no they do not charge you to use the salsa bar, that is not true. i recommend that you try, you will like it.
