I was a bit nervous about the area at first, but it really seems to be ok in the lot.

There was a wait, a good sign for lunch at a place this size (its really a huge restaurant).  Wait was short though.  Service wasnt super speedy but not excessively long.   

Not the food, we got Tacos, enchiladas, and chille rellenos.  (Spelling sorry). It was EXCELLENT!!   Some of the best I've eaten of this type. Even the beans and rice was great!!  The salsa was to die for.  Its the hot type and it did have a kick to it but not over powering. It would have been nice to not get all broken chips from the bottom of the batch though. Both basket fulls were all broken. 

They have two dinning rooms, if your in for a quiet meal, ask for the front one as the back was quite loud.   

I cant quite give it a 5 but the food certainly was.
