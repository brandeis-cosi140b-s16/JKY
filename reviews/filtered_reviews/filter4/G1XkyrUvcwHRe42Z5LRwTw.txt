This place is great.  I wanted some type of local food and I found this place with yelp.  We came for lunch and saw the waterfall out front, it was kind of cool.  I will agree with some reviewers, that this place is dark inside.  

We ordered the carne adovada, crab stuffed pablano peppers,  lobster enchilada, and snapper tacos.  The carne adovada and crab stuffed pablano peppers were great.  The lobster enchilada was ok.  The snapper tacos was the least favorite one, I would probably not order that one again.  

Overall the food was great, and if I am ever in the Scottsdale area, I would probably come back here.
