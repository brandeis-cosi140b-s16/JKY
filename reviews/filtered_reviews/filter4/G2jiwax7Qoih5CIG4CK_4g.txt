My co-workers and I did a less formal version of a "battle of the tacos" between Los Tacos and Tacos el Gordo.

Here's the basic run down:

The tacos are bigger here and they cost more that Tacos el Gordo too. At $3.00 a taco WITHOUT the works on it. To have all the extra add ons it would be an additional $2 each. Here, I only had to purchase 2 tacos versus 4 at Tacos el Gordo (which ultimately comes out the same anyway). I don't know what kind of tortilla TeG uses, but I was disappointed to see that LT doesn't make their tacos. It was definitely store bought.

The taco breakdown:

LENGUA: I do like the lengua here. A lot "saltier" and "full of flavor" than TeG. You also get a bigger portion too. I personally like the lengua here more.

AL PASTOR: Also very good (i guess comparable to the ADOBADO i tried in TeG, but only because their both marinated pork). Super good, tender pork, and bold with a slightly sweet taste to it. 

Definitely a good off the strip location to go to if Tacos el Gordo is too overwhelming for you since it is on he strip and they have lines on top of lines.

My co-worker got a TORTA, and if you're wondering what that is, it's basically a sandwich version of everything else in a toasted fresh-like roll. It looks pretty good! If you are looking for something less messy and complicated other than a burrito...I'd say go for it. I've never tried this version before, and I'd like to come back to experience it.
