Mexican chopped salad w/grilled
Chicken = yummmm! I love roasted corn so maybe a little bias ;) but mix of everything was pretty good! Only 2 things I would change if I could: 1) make the tortilla strips shorter - I felt that they were having a fight with my mouth & face lol 2) I'll more than likely ask for jalape√±os next time. Needs a bit more of that kick/salty taste.

Overall tho, I'll definitely be back!
Super clean, friendly staff including bartender. Outside patio is somewhat small but still great to be sitting at. They have misters so helps keep the inside cool air flowing.
