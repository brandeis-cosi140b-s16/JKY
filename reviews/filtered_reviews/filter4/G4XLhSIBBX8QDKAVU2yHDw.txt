Gosh, after hearing and reading so many great reviews about Komex, we decided to stop by for lunch after 90 mins of pilates/yoga. It was quite a distance(22+ mins) and in the hood, but was worthed. We were quite excited to see on the item of the week board "4 tacos for $5, fusion/Mexican".  This is a great deal to sample different tacos. 

My friend, Patty, and I each got the
- bulgogi: this taco reigned supreme by Patty and I.  Unique and delish. We put the Chinese hot sauce/salsa on this baby and got ourselves a flavorful and tantalizing heaping of greatness. 
-asada: top this off with the Mexican salsa...good, but My taste bud could not forget the bulgogi
- carnita: oh how the pork was kinda crispy...I forgot about the bulgogi taco for a nano-second
-pollo:  I was full when I came to this taco. So I tried a piece of the chicken. Can't stack this up against the aforementioned three. Earl finished this taco for me.

We also tried the spam musubi. Portion was big. Was alright. 

I had a taste of the bulgogi burrito and it was very yummy with the Kim chi in it. Like what every other yelpers have mentioned, the burrito is gianormous.  It has value written all over it. 

Additionally, the Kim chi was super delicious. 

There isn't much decor and the seats were not the most comfy seats, but after eating the food, I forgot about it. 

We really wanted to try the pork taco on the fusion but they ran out of it. Boo. I was really excited to try that one too. Has to be for next time then.
