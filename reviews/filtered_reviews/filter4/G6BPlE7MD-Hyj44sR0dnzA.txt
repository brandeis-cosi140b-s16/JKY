Very dark restaurant... the one in Newport Coast is much more greener and feels like you are venturing into a tropical environment. 

We came on a Thursday for lunch at 1pm while we were staying at the nearby Vdara Hotel & Spa. We were craving Mexican and I have always adored the Javier's in Newport Coast so I figured we would try this place too.

Beautiful bathroom, definitely use it. Lovely  carved wooden mirror with tall mirrored stalls. 

Excellent service. Spacious and comfortable booths... Authentic music playing to get you in a romantic Mood. I have had better Mexican food at other restaurants but you come here for the ambience not only the food and we would definitely come here again.
