I live in Henderson so I always see Nacho Daddy while driving down Eastern. Yesterday my mom and I decided to give it a try. 

It wasn't to busy yet. We were greeted by a friendly hostess and decided to seat ourselves in the bar. Lucky for us it was happy hour. They have an awesome happy hour menu. A variety of different apps and nachos from $3-$6 and great drink specials. We went for the calamari, Thai chicken nachos, and supreme tostada nachos. 

Food Pros: The Thai chicken nachos are my new favorite thing. So delicious and good layers of flavor. These were personal portions and they were very generous! Big pieces of fire grilled chicken. And who ever thought of having the sweet chili sauce and the creamy queso sauce is a genius. The kicker: the house made jalapeno corn chips. The supreme tostada nachos were very tasty. These are your classic nachos. The nachos you want while watching the game. Mounds of delicious cheesy goodness, sour cream, guacamole, ground beef,  and jalapenos. Both nachos had perfect chip to stuff ratio. Nobody wants all these plain chips leftover on the bottom with no yummyness to scoop them up with.

Food Cons: The calamari was ok. I've had a lot of calamari in my day. It was hot, crunchy, a little to much breading, the pieces were kind of tiny, but for $5 it wasn't bad at all. The best part was the serrano aioli for dipping. 

Service: Our server was overall attentive and friendly. Especially with my mother's indecisiveness. A bit slow at the end when we were waiting for our check and return of check. 

I will definitely go back again. It would be a great place to watch the game or have a drink with friends. They have great football game specials as well. Our bill was only $18 with tax. I am interested in trying more of the menu and seeing if everything matches up to the fantastic Thai Chicken Nachos!
