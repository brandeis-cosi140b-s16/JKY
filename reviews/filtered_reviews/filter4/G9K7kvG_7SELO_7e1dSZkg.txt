I give this place 3.5-4 stars. We went there last night wanting very spicy food. We were seated right away. The restaurant has nice fun decor. We got our chips and salsa very quickly. The salsa was the spiciest sales we have had at a restaurant. It was vey good and flavorful. 
We also ordered guac. It was so tasty. I loved every bite of it. My husband asked the waiter what the spiciest dish was and he recommended adovado enchiladas. I got red chile cheese enchiladas. I was so scared they were going to be spicy so I ordered sour cream as a chaser. I also ordered a house margarita. The baby got a side of beans for her second dinner. 
The food was very good. It had nice flavor and was very tasty. It didn't live up to the spicy hype. I had no problems eating mine. I didn't even need water. It was still good but I was on a spicy mission and wanted my husband to sweat. He still enjoyed his meal and said he would go back. Maybe we went on an off spicy night? Not sure but our search continues for spicy food...

Overall good food, decent service, tasty chips (I wish they were endless though)
