The Stand holds a special spot in my heart before I even tried their food since this is the old location of Maui Dogs, and that's where I had my first date with the hubbs. That's what made it even more satisfying to find that the food didn't disappoint! I got the standard double patty cheeseburger with grilled onions and a grilled jalapeno plus a side of fries and a salted dulce de leche shake. I enjoyed all of it. The other reviews on Yelp hit the nail on the head when they describe it as a sort of pseudo-in-n-out. I would say they are pretty similar in many ways but I'd also say they have some key differences. I can only commit to saying I like both in different ways. The jalapeno and grilled onions are a must when ordering a burger here, I like anything and everything spicy so the fact that they spread the whole jalapeno out on the burger (with the seeds) instead of little slices from a jar made a world of difference and gave it a glorious kick. The fries were my cup-o-tea, similar to in-n-out. My man thinks they were a little soggy for his taste but I thought they were just as soggy at in-n-out and I devoured them. The shake was AMAZEBALLS but I definitely think I might have gone into diabetic shock after sharing one with Eric. The staff was really nice, but really slow. We waited for half an hour for our food and when we finally got it we asked if it would've been faster to go through the drive thru and they gave an honest answer (which I admire)-- they're just slow. lol Can't hate on the truth! They are fairly new so I bet they will speed up the service with more experience. Can't wait to come back!
