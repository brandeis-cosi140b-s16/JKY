I ate there last September with my boss.  It's definitely a Southwest cuisine kind of place.  I'm not a big Tex-Mex fan, but my boss loves Mexican food.  It's kind of a funny story, but a couple of days before we went here, my boss said there was a Mexican restaurant across the street from the GD plant (the old Motorola building) on McDowell Blvd (Locals know what I'm talking about).  I didn't recall any Mexican places there and sho'nuff, it was a Cajun restaurant (and closed).  So we walked a mile and  half in 108 degree heat until we hit a Mexican restaurant -- TACO Bell.  I didn't think it was possible to F--k Up a cheese quesadilla, but it was awful.  My boss hated his meal and got a bad case of the runs all afternoon.

So I felt bad for my boss and took a bullet for him.  I found Blue Adobe to be a highly ranked place and invited him to meet me there.  It was a bit of a drive, but definitely well worth the trek,  He ordered a Mexican dish (I forgot what it was) and truly enjoyed it.  I had the chicken stuffed with chorizo and liked my dish as well.  Chorizo is the one Mexican item I do enjoy.

Margarita's were good, but a bit smallish.

I highly recommend Blue Adobe.
