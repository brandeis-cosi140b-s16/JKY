Yes.  The guac is fresh made table side.  The chips are really ho hum and cold.  The prk shoulder tacos are excellent.  The pumpkin pudding is unique and, if one has room , definitely worth getting.  We have a service dog and this was the only restaurant that didn't offer him a drink in all of Scottsdale.
