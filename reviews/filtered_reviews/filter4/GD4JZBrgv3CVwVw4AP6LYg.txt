I love this place. Always crowded and loud , casual, great Mexican food (for Phoenix) at reasonable prices. This food is close to tex-mex which is what I prefer. Can't go wrong with the Tee Pee Special or the Presidential Special. Nice patio out front. Good chips and salsa when you sit down. Cold beer and margaritas. What's not to love?!
