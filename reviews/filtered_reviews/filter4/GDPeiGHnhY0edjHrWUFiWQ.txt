The enchiladas salsa verde is a great tasting dish, very flavorful, simple but keeps to the basics which makes it delicious.  The chicken was very moist and tender.  

The churros were decent, they had a caramel filling inside and you get some whipped cream and chocolate dipping sauce to go with it.

All in all, a small mom and pop shop in the neighborhood that's great for lunch.  If you're in the area, it's a good spot to drop by.
