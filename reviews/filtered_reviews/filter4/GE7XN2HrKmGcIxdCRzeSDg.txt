Las Glorias has awesome dishes at very reasonable prices. I've only been there once, but the meals were outstanding, and my co-workers assure me about all the other meals I've yet to try are just as good as the Green Chili Burro that I ordered. The meat was good, as well as the sauce. The beans and rice were what you would normally except to get. I wish they had black beans as an alternative to refried beans, but then again - I didn't ask for them either. 

To me, the chips and salsa weren't the best. I've had much better chips, salsa and bean dip at other places, but these weren't greasy, so that was good. It didn't keep me from eating a bunch of chips, but I think they were going for major gringo-style on the salsa and bean dip. 

I can't wait to try the specially-priced fish tacos on Wednesdays, along with a Corona .. after work. 

Service seemed par for the course. Nothing stellar, and a bit slow, especially considering it wasn't that busy at the time. 

I can see myself coming back here, again and again.
