This is my families go to place for Mexican food. We've never had a bad meal here, the service is pretty good considering how busy it always is, and the price isn't that bad since you get big plates. The only time it's loud is during the dinner rush but it's definitely do able. The Margaritas and friend ice cream are also a must and your drinks are always being refilled.
