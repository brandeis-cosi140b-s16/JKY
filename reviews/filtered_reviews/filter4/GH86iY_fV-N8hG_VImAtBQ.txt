Came as a recommendation by a friend that visited here when he was in Phoenix.
I also had to come because there was HAPPY HOUR and UNLIMITED SALSA.

TINGA STREET TACO ($1.25)
- wasn't too spicy
- very well marinated
- I originally only ordered 1 but couldn't resist and ordered another one soon after I finished the first one!

CARNE ASADA STREET TACO ($1.25)
- meat was relatively tender
- good but definitely preferred the Tinga Street Taco more

MARGARITA ($3)
- not too strong that it tasted like alcohol but there was definitely alcohol in there.
- good drink to help celebrate the beginning of the weekend. 

HORCHATA ($3.99)
- VERY GOOD
- different from any horchata I had before; it had dices of cantaloupe, honeydew, and strawberry
- super large thirst quencher

UNLIMITED SALSA BAR
- any salsa from strawberry, cilantro, pecan, or pico de gallo
- I almost tried everything because well I've never been to a place with so much variety
- it also helped that I had unlimited chips so I just kept trying

SERVICE: nothing too special. Staff members were friendly and refilled my water appropriately.

ENVIRONMENT: a bit hidden in a not so great part of Phoenix. There is the large signage that you know it's not the wrong place. The place doesn't get too busy which was good.

Overall, great place for tacos. I can't compare it to other places in Phoenix but I did enjoy my visit. They are a bit different than the tacos I have in LA Taco Trucks mainly because I get different kinds. The price is reasonable and well UNLIMITED SALSA BAR! Also try the horchata...it's so refreshing!
