The food here is really good...especially when you're drinking, drunk, in the process of sobering up or hungover and recovering. It really just seems to hit the spot. 

We stayed here @ the Hard Rock and ordered food to go, and it was incredibly fast considering how long we could have potentially waited. The only bad part about the takeout is that apparently it takes a while to get some salsa and it caused my friend to almost blow a gasket. LMAO
