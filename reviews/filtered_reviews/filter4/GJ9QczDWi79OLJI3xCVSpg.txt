So, after being kicked to the curb by a former favorite outdoor place, I wound up here with a good friend.  I love this place but have been so-so on the pricing and service.  I really needed to have a good experience to make up for my terrible morning.  What a good time, Rokerij!  As always, I had the killer enchiladas with red sauce and as always, they did not disappoint!  The staff was pleasant and attentive, clearly more attention is being paid there.  The best part was a good Bloody (low spice) and beer back with (wait for it) STRAWS!!!  Apparently their personal jihad against the evil liquor conveyance device has been lifted.  The experience was lovely!
