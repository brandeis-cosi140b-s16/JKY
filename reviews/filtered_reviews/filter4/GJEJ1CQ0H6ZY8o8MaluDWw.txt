Been going there, since I was a kid! Still a great place to gather, large parties of 8 or more never seem to be a problem. The Irish Mexican pops out a mean cheese crisp! And they even have wheat tortilla's! Foods fresh, place is clean, service is great, & the tacos ROCK, but for a kick, my fav. is the green chili burros done enchie style!! Race on over.
