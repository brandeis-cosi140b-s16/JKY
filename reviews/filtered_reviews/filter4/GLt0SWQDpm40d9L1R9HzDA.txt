Amazing. 

Building and atmosphere is wonderful. I love the architecture and design of this old church. 

The food. Wowza. Everybody needs to try the street corn here at least once. Outstanding. I could eat it all day every day! I prefer the old world tacos to the new school tacos. They also give you a choice of flour or corn tortilla (or lettuce cup for the health nut). My favorite is the braised beef taco on a flour tortilla. As for sides, the house salad and red beans are great choices. 

I will definitely be back as there are many other things I still want to try...and it's just a cool place to hang out anyway!
