I went there not knowing if I would have "Texas" tacos. Yes they do and they have a nice variety of them. Started off with the guacomole . Generous size and very well seasoned. They serve you unlimited chips. You pick out your salsa at the salsa bar! Good selcetions for anyones taste. Red and green of course. I ordered the 3 taco plate with refried beans and rice. Other options are available. The surprise came when our waitress asked if I wanted all 3 Pork or did I want to mix and match! I said sure. You can have one of each variety offered. Now YOU know! I could have sworn our waitress was from the Great State but she said no. Must be something she picked up in working for Tubb's. My friend asked if they had Lone Star beer. She said sure! Will wonders never cease. The taco's came out on fluffy shells, Fresh and tasty. No room for dessert. The meal was satisfying and inexpensive. Try them out!
