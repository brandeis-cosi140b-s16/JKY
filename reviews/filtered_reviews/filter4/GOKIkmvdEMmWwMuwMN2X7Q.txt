We've had take out from Carolina's a couple of times, but have never eaten inside. The food is great. The mini-chimis are tasty. We got tortillas to go last time, and they are nice and soft, making great burritos. I'd venture in for a sit down meal but they don't serve alcohol, and Mexican food is just not the same without beer.
