I have visited La Unica many times and the experience has always been consistent... excellent food and excellent service.

I am hooked on the Tacos La Unica. Two or three of these and I am happy! I have also dined on many of the specials mainly during the lunch hour and they have all been excellent.

The chips and salsa are free. The food prices are very reasonable for the quality. We have never had a bad experience.

The staff is always prompt and polite. The manager always makes an effort to stop by and say hello to us and make sure we are being taken care of and that the food is good.

My family loves to go to La Unica and asks all the time to go. 

Now that La Unica is on my mind, maybe I'll be the one asking to go tonight!

I would give five stars if they had cervesas or margaritas, but consider this a 4.5.
