I have lived in N. Scottsdale for over a year now and recently realized two things. 1) America's had a N. Scottsdale location and 2) how close this location was to my house. This was lucky for me since I was craving a chorizo breakfast burrito and ATS serves breakfast burritos all day. I called to place my order and they said it would be ready in 15 minutes. I hopped in my car and was on my way. The restaurant is located right off the 101 on Via de Ventura nestled next to a gas station/car wash and a few other businesses. There is ample parking outside and plenty of seating inside. Additionally, there is a tiny patio in the front.

Since my first order, I have been back a few times and every time (usually between 8am - 11am) the place is dead. (Maybe one other customer either placing an order or just arriving as I was leaving.) I know they have Happy Hour, but I've never experienced it. Maybe it livens up for a lunch rush or dinner? Either way, the employees have always been nice and my order has always been correct and ready in the time allotted. 

Overall, they have great breakfast burritos. My husband liked their tacos but they didn't pack them to-go very well. (Three tacos inside one foil wrapper make squished/messy tacos.) I'll definitely be back and maybe one day try their Happy Hour.
