Nothing goes better with Mexican food than margaritas. And luckily at Jalapeno's they have a trio sampler so you get choose and enjoy three drinks for $10! 
Both my girlfriend and I love seafood food, so it worked out that I got the lobster tacos (sweet lobster meat with cilantro, onion and cheese) which came with a big serving of rice and beans and my gf got the tequila lime shrimp tacos so we could trade off.

Both meals came out quickly, and the plates were massive! We gorged on the delish tacos which went great with our margaritas! 

Our waitress was great, and she joked how they had a wheelbarrow out back to carry us out. Not gonna lie, I almost took her up on the offer - we were stuffed!  

This place is awesome, I can't wait to come back here when I'm in Scottsdale again.
