First visit on a Saturday night & this new spot has no problem packing a place! Beautiful decor. Started with a passion fruit cocktail which consisted of Mezcal tequila, passion fruit and ginger beer it was served in a stainless steel mug.  The presentation was not only beautiful but refreshing and delish. My patron margarita unfortunately was too sweet and my counterparts agreed. 

We ordered quite a bit of sushi & it was all lovely. The nigiri needs some work but the rolls were very good, small & petite, the perfect bite.

The Korean steak tacos got an A+ from 2 of my dining companions.

Another standout is the green mojito. Wow! Tastes like  a coconut boozy milkshake. I would order it for dessert! 

Our server was Chelsea and she was attentive, and was very good at her job. 

I look forward to going back again and trying more of the menu as well as happy hour.
