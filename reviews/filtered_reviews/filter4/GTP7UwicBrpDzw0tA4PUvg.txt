I am also disappointed at the poor reviews of Los Sombreros. I have never been unhappy with the food or atmosphere here. Sometimes the service is a little slow on the first contact, but once you order the food comes pretty quickly--and it's good! I've been here 5 or 6 times and always leave with leftovers--large portions in general are served! The margaritas are so-so in my opinion, but they have a huge tequila selection and lots of mescal. The best things on the menu? The lamb is delicious but better for you spice lovers; carnitas are superb; yummy chunky guacamole (although this could probably come in a bigger bowl); huitlacoche crepas; and lots of their specials (i had really good duck tacos once! unfortunately i have yet to see it on the specials again). I took my parents, including my dad who needs perfect service, here and they both enjoyed it. 

Pros: outdoor seating
          delicious food

Mediocre: margaritas

Cons: wait till first service
