A great traditional Mexican restaurant.  5 star decor and views of an older Dobson Ranch lake area.  Service was 5 star.  2 or 3 combo deals Mex and Match are a good deal.   The tortilla soup is the best secret.   Get it as your side.  Ground beef burrito was just ok.  It was bland, even as I ordered enchilada style, I wish it had more sauce and cheese.   Cilantro lime dressing was weak on the salad switched to cilantro ranch.  The kids combo is huge.  Kids bean burro was small.  Side of fruit was just grapes.
