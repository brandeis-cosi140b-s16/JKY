This place has everything if you love Tacos!! Cheap tacos, great location, and the meat is great and seasoned just right!! These are true street tacos! This is no place for someone who is health conscious, no fish and no chicken (at least none I saw) 100% beef  and the cilantro, salsa, onion, lime.. just perfect. I had the asada and chorizo... delish.
