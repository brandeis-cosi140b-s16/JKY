Holy sweet tiny baby Jesus wrapped in swaddling clothes, this was one good-ass breakfast joint. I had their crab omelet... O_o it was fabulous! One of those "I feel so full but I will continue to eat this" type moments. You keep shoveling it in, pausing briefly for digestion, then shovel more in so you can finish it. I admittedly fell into a food coma about 3 hours later, but soo worth it. I really enjoyed their food and everyone else's food that I sampled from while they weren't looking. My only complaint was that it was ridiculously freezing in there, but no matter. My chattering teeth made it easier for me to eat faster.
