Great experience!!

Came with a group of 9 very picky eaters! Everyone's needs were accommodated from vegetarian to simple kids meals. 

I ordered the queso crisp which was like a Mexican pizza. Pretty large portion, probably not meant for one person. But sooo good. Not overly done. 

Taco selection is very diverse and obviously gooood.

Note for vegetarians! Rice is cooked in chicken stock!! 

And request light cheese for cheese enchiladas!

Ambience was great; really good selection of drinks too
