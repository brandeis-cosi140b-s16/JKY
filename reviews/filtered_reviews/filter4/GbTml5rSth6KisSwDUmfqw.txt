Looking for fast and DELICIOUS mexican food? Go to Roberto's and find happiness. Order the carne asada nachos and find bliss (as well as an extra pound or two). The service was suprisingly good. The cashier was super friendly (unlike some of the other Roberto's I went to). She was also very accomadating to the guests.
-she replaced someone's ordered happily and even gave them the mistake order. (some places don't even do that!)
-a few customers didn't know what to get and she helped them out

Man, I wish I got her name down. 

The location is a bit older than the other gazillion roberto's that are around but the bathrooms were clean.

Now that I've mentioned the bathrooms, I can talk about the food...

The food was delicious. I ordered the carne asada nachos and I truly was about to cry in delight. The last time I got it (at a different location) it was very oily at the bottom. This time, it was not. There was so much meat on there I thought I was going to pop.

Did I mention that it was 24 hours??
