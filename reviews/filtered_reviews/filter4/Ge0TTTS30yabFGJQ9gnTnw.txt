NYE at Se√±or Frogs for the win! I decided to go by myself & bring in the new year here. General admission ticket purchased in advance for $20 which is cheap compared to some of the other parties with celebrities. Upon arrival the check in process was very unorganized. Finally someone came and told me to go to the front because I'd already purchased my ticket. 
The bartenders were great and I loved the DJ. I made some friends with strangers so that was nice. I'd wish I would have purchased the open bar option but I made friends with a guy who was too drunk to drink his whole bottle of Jack. He shared. 
I didn't get my champagne for the toast as it advertised (technically) that night but I made friends with someone who bought a table and they shared. Also Someone stole my coat but luckily nothing was in it & it was cheap. 
Overall I had a great time & I'd love to do Vegas in NYE again. It has now been crossed off my life list.
