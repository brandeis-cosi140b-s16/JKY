Chipotle is probably my favorite fast foot chain. The food is always high quality even if it's obviously a lot higher in sodium and calories than they'd like to admit. Everything tastes good and fresh. If you go at a busy time, it also feels like the line always moves fast, too. 

But there's too big things that keep me from giving it five stars. The first was raising their already high prices last year. I don't like that I can buy a Burrito at a sit-down restaurant for nearly the same price. 
The other is how they charge you for everything. Not only are items like chips and guacamole extra, but they come in huge sizes. If you're going to charge me for a big scoop of guacamole, at least offer me a half size for cheaper.
