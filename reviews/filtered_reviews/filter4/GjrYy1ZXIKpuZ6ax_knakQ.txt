I've been here a few times and always had great food. On the latest trip, I tried the duck quesadilla. It's the only time I've seen duck used in a quesadilla, but the meat was plentiful and had an excellent flavor. The tortilla and cheese were cooked well. It also came with a blood orage habanero dipping sauce, which was incredible. The fruit flavors made it almost like candy, but then the habanero packed a huge punch of spice. I definitely recommend this dish. 

Another tasty item is the chips and guacamole appetizer. I don't typically like guacamole, but they do a great job here and mix in a lot of fresh ingredients. You can ask for salsa on the side as well.

The staff are friendly and courteous. The menu items are priced fairly. Although it is located way out in the middle of nowhere, this is a place worth trying for a nice Mexican-inspired meal.
