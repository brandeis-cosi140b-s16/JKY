Great food - the salsa is flavorful spicy without being too hot.  The food is innovative yet authentic.  One thing I've learned is that if you get served "orange cheese" you're not in a REAL Mexican restaurant!  The service can be lacking at times, but generally they are on top of things and - especially for lunch - they can get you in and out of there fairly quickly.
