I've been trying various cheap mexican food "stands" in an effort to find something that resembles what you find in San Diego.  Fiesta Burrito is the best I've found in the valley.  (note: Los Favoritos is up there with it)

I've had mostly burritos and rolled tacos, but I've really liked them.  Carne Asada, bean-and-cheese, and breakfast burritos have all been very solid.  I like the rolled tacos, as well.

My companion on a recent visit ordered the "rolled tacos supreme" (where they pile carne asada and other stuff on top of 5 rolled tacos).  Wow, I'd never noticed that before...can I try one?  In a word, awesome.  Not very practical to eat, but really yummy.

Although I expect (and accept) a little tummy-turning after a meal at a place like this, I've never had even the slightest grumble after eating at Fiesta.

It's cheap and they DO accept credit cards.
