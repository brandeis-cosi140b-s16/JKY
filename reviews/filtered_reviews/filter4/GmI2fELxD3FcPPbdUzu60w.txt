Great "modern mexican" place.  Don't go here looking for anything authentic.  It is certainly on the pricier side of mexican food, but it is fairly priced for what it is.  

We ate here late on a Saturday night and got the "front and center" outdoor table.  We had a blast, as the people watching on a nice night is outstanding (WHERE do all of these crazies come from, really!!??)

So long as you know what you are walking into here, you'll have a great experience.
