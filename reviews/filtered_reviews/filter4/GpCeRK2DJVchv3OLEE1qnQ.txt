I have been in Vegas for 7+ years and easily tried 25+ Mexican restaurants.  My search has officially ended.  The salsa is very good, the service is always spot on.  Portion size is enough to take home left overs.  Fried ice cream is wonderful and the menu choices are varied.  And of course the margaritas are always a hit. 

It is nice to see a 'neighborhood' place that is usually busy 5 nights out of 7.  I imagine this encourages the staff to stay on as there are many familiar faces there week after week, month, etc.

Also, love to know that Leticia is in the kitchen--this is not some phantom great Aunt twice removed on the brother's side....who passed down her recipes.
