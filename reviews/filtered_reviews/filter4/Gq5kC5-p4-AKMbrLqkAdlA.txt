When there are lines to get into an eatery tucked away at a dingy strip mall on Old Monroe Road in Indian Land, two things come to mind. One, either this is one hell of a good restaurant, or, two, it's the only decent place to eat within a ten-mile radius, and people are hungry, and better eat there than go hungry. Thankfully, La Unica is indeed one hell of a great Mexican restaurant.

As far as "authentic" Mexican eateries are concerned, La Unica passes some strict requirements. Being that most Mexican restaurants tend to lean towards Tex-Mex (and there's nothing wrong with that), La Unica is one of the few that serves more typical Mexican fare, more from southern Mexico. In other words, lots of seafood in addition to standards like enchiladas and tamales. 

Everyone's mentioned the carnitas, and I too will sing its praises: best carnitas in Charlotte. So tender and succulent! I had the carnita burrito, and it was so damned good that I was tempted to have another, but, crikey, that would have been excessive. 

One big thing to keep in mind: La Unica does NOT have a liquor license, so you won't be able to chase down your carnitas tacos with a cold Tecate. And, no, they won't allow you to bring your own cerveza either. Bummer. YO QUIERO TECATE CON MI TACOS AL PASTOR, PINCHE!
