Green Dacha is pretty legit. Delivery from grubhub. $8 from GH was a little steep (from Trop/15 to Rancho/Oakey) but everything was very good, and leftovers were just as good. 

Got some beef stroganoff, cabbage and beef pirojki (bit of a false cognate with pierogi; these are more like phyllo pastry turnovers), stuffed cabbage (prefer the ones I make at home, but that's more a style thing than a quality one -- these were good), and vareniki (which is an order of pierogies).

Definitely recommended as a change-up from the usual pizza/wings/thai/chinese takeout selection. Just as stick-to-your-ribs though.

Have not eaten in, so can't comment on the restaurant itself.
