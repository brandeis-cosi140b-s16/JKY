What can I say about Chino that hasn't been said already? I was introduced by a couple of IT geek friends - yes, it really is a geek hotspot, with good proximity to some of the biggest IT employers in the Valley. I was initially intimidated by the ordering system, but it's really not that difficult after a couple-three repetitions (and believe me, after one visit you WILL be back). The samples were invaluable in helping me understand the different flavors and textures.

And oh my %DEITY%, what flavors and textures. Whether you like it mouth-scorchingly hot or mild and sweet or both at the same time, Chino has something for you. 

The ambience? Frankly, who cares? It's a low-class dive and that's how the regulars like it. Bring on the grub and let the peeling walls and stained floors look after themselves.

I live 49.6 miles from Chino North and even further from the Chandler location, and I still make a point of taking my daughter there monthly. I usually get Jade Red Chicken, Jen Red Pork, pork fried rice and black beans (with Sobe Lean from the fountain because, you know, I'm just that health-conscious), but I've tried everything on the menu and it's all great.

Seriously, if you've never been, you need to at least give Chino a try. Just be warned, it's addictive. About the only thing that could make it better is if they delivered.

PS: VOLCANO COOKIES FTW.
