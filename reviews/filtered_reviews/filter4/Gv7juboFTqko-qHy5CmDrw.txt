We had heard about the downtown Phoenix Los Dos Molinos being so good and hoped this restaurant of the same chain would be as good. Our waiter assured us that the menu and quality are the same. I ordered the two taco special with carne asada steak. My husband ordered the beef enchilada special and was warned that it would be spicy. The sauces are made with hatch chilis, which fits with its New Mexico-themed menu.
My husband decided after tasting my mildly -spicy only tacos that he would stay away from the spicy options next time and go with 'mild' in the future. One can always add      either the complimentary green or red salsa if one wants it hotter.
We loved the beans. Spanish rice seemed pretty ordinary. Vanilla flan was outstanding. Excellent service by all staff.
We would recommend this place to anyone who wants to try something other than the typical Sonoran fare in Phoenix.
