Went around 7pm on a weekday and it was relatively busy, but my boyfriend and I were seated right away. Our drink order was taken within a minute or two, and the food and service was all good! They brought our drinks quickly, as well as chips and salsa. I had the chicken enchiladas and my boyfriend had the fish tacos. Both were delivered faster than we anticipated and were delicious. Good portion of food, although it was a little pricy. We paid about $45. There was no mariachi since it was a weekday, but they did have a live singer singing mexican music. The best part was the horchata I ordered - yum!
