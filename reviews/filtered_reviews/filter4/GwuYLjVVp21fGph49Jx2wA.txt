First and foremost, always use a coupon. If you live in Chandler they should come in the mail every other week. This will save you at least $12. Everyone here is friendly. The food has never disappointed and I've been here about 100 times. There are many good selection. The shredded beef taco is big and juicy. It tastes amazing. The burritos are decent but are a little bland. The Chimichanga is good, but is it worth the extra calories for being deep fried? That all depends on your metabolism. My new favorite choice here is the Mexican pizza. It is huge and filling. There are so many different flavors going on. The chips and salsa here are my favorite(tied with Serrano's that is). There is also a nice patio outside on a pond with a water fountain in the water that lights up at night. It looks pretty cool.
