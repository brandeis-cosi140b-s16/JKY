The Cresent Ballroom makes me happy. 

We've seen We Were Promised Jetpacks (the sound was turned up so high, it pulverized my eardrums...and I like my eardrums nice and pulverized); Sergio Mendoza Y La Orkesta; Miniature Tigers and several other bands. Great small- to medium-sized venue, good sound, excellent A/C (!!!) and bleachers parallel to the stage should you decide sitting is more your style. Parking can be sketchy, only because there's a pay lot next door and there always seems to be someone sleeping on the ground in the back side of the lot. 

So, I recommend you get there early, park on the street and spend some time in their outstanding lounge before the show. Or you could just hit the lounge like we did last weekend. 

Go.
