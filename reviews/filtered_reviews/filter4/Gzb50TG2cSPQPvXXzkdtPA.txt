I don't think I would really classify Z tejas as a four star restaurant, but I love the place for my wednesday afternoon lunches.  I have the day off from work so I like to come here, have some margaritas and usually the chicken mac, and read on the patio.  I'm one of the only crazy people in Arizona that still sits out on the patio in the 116 degree weather.  The staff is always very attentive and are very kind in turning on the misters just for me.  The margaritas are amazing, and the food that I've tried is also incredibly delicious.  

3.5 for the food
4 for the margaritas and atmosphere.
