The lake view is what brings my friends and I to this place for an occasional dinner. Place gets packed so we try to come later than the prime time dinner rush. That really works best on the weekend when the hours of operation are a little longer. So... I've tried a lot of their dishes - Fundidos, Shrimp Enchilada Dinner, etc but once I tried their Shrimp Stuffed Poblano Chiles - that was it! I could never try another dish off their menu. Like the pathetic and predictable crack addict that lives for the next hit I come here and predictably get that each and every single time. I mean it comes with everything I love - shrimp, calabacitas, chiles, melted Monterey Jack cheese and jalapeno-lime cream sauce. So Valle Luna, don't you ever ever ever ever ever take that off the menu or I will walk out of your restaurant for the last time ever after throwing a tantrum that would have even embarassed John McEnroe back in the day. One valid complaint that I'm not alone in (judging from OTHER reviews) is they stopped serving the bean dip with the chips. Now it's just the blander salsa that the chips come with. And now they charge a kidney for the beam dip if you still want it. Well not really THAT much - it's more like just a big toe or something. But they used to give it for free as part of the complementary chips and dip. For that I dock a star - since that awesome dip was a mandatory part of the complete Valle Luna experiece. Lots of parking - shares a mall with Nate's Third Base, Sprouts, Hon Machi Sushi, Coffee Rush, and Pita Jungle.
