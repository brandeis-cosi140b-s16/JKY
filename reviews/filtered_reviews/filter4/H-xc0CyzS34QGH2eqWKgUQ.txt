This place is pretty good. I went in with my wife and ordered carne asada tacos. I was a little taken aback when the cashier said I could not have them with cilantro and onion. However, I just had them with the house toppings and was pleasantly surprised. The salsa bar is good too. The quality of the meat is excellent and their outdoor seating is a great way to enjoy your meal there.

The only down side to this place is that they were blasting reggaeton music on the speakers. Not that great for having a conversation and I'm pretty sure the owners are from Mexico, not the DR. Didn't really fit the place.
