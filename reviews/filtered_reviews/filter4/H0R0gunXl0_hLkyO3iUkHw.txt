This place has awesome fish tacos.  I tried the blackened mahi mahi taco and the beer battered shrimp taco both tasted great.  I also chose the avocado pasta salad as my side and it was great.  It had the right blend of spice and avocado.  I didn't care for the corn salsa that was complimentary with chips when your first seated but that was the only thing I didn't like.  It did not take long to be seated and the customer service was great!  I would definitely recommend it you are in the area.  I look forward to going back the next time I'm in town.
