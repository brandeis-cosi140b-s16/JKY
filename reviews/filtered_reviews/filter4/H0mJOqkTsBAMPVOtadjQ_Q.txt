Fun place for a lively night out. Very mixed crowd with all different age groups.  Dance floor is tiny and food is mediocre but staff is very nice and drinks are reasonable. They also have a decent happy hour menu. Last time we went on a Saturday and received a free bottle of bubbly (see photos). Overall pretty fun, just make sure to wear proper shoes :)
