Had dinner on Easter here. Food was once again very good. Had the chicken fajitas. 
Service was slow, took server over 10 minutes to come to our table to order.

The chips and dip that they provide for 2 people free, is the same as they serve for 4 people at the table. Does not make sense.

Bean dip and guac. are great.
