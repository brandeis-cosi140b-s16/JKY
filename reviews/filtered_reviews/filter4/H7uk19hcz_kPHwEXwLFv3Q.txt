The short story: Excellent ambiance: Very old school, dim lighting, chandeliers, dark bar. Lovely Christmas decorations, greenery, black and white feather Christmas tree. Tile floor, lots of cougars. Yea, I don't know why that's relevant, but I thought I would mention it. 

Drinks - extensive menu. The chipotle pepper margarita was awesome, REALLY spicy. I had the kale and orange salad, which was good, but not as outstanding as all the reviews on this website would lead me to believe. W side of white beans, which were yummy also. My date had the steak tacos, which he thought tasted like salted cardboard. But I didn't try them so can't say. They looked good. Anyhow, I am looking forward to going again but next time will try the guacamole and the squash tacos. Oh and the bread pudding.
