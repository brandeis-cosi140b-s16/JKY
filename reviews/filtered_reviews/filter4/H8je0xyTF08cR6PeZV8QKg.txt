Vegetarian here.

Luckily, Roberto's doesn't use any lard or animal products in its beans.

After reading the glowing reviews here on Yelp, I reluctantly tried out this spot for lunch. Reluctantly, because it's inside of a Shell gas station.

When I got inside, I was surprised to see that the Roberto's took up a big chuck of real estate inside the building, around one quarter to one third takes up the restaurant seating area. You can sit at a table or at a bar area with a view out the window. 

I ordered a bean, cheese and potato burrito. It took them awhile to get my burrito ready, but it was piping hot (temperature) when it arrived. After letting it cool a bit and burning my mouth a few times, I wolfed it down. Their red salsa is also fantastic, loved the flavor, poured it on top of my burrito at every bite.

I would make this my new breakfast burrito spot too, but they don't open until 10AM on Sundays.
