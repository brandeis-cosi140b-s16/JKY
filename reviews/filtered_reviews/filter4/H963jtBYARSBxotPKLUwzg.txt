I was told about Rudy's by a friend some months ago, and although it was really far away for me, I wanted to give it a try because of his enthusiastic vocal review and $4.50 burritos, and I finally got around to trying the place. Rudy's has traditional Mexican food like menudo, "street tacos" (4 for $5.00 and 99 cents each on Tuesdays), and a LARGE variety of combo plates. I definitely think you'll find something you'll like!

Rudy's is tucked into a nook to the right of Albertson's, Ellsworth and Baseline in Mesa. Dine in or take out, the place is spartan but accommodating enough for many people and has a mounted TV. There's also an umbrella'd table outside. It's a family business, and the daughters help out. I recommend eating in.

I had the steak burrito, and the ingredients are pure, predictable and delicious. It lacked some zing that I like, so I added some Tapatio, but if you're looking for the pure ingredients and their flavors, they're all there. I think next time I'll have the marinated pork, as I really like red chile. The dishes are simple, pleasing to the eyes and delicious. The burritos aren't as big as Chipotle, but they don't have to be, and the price is just right and that's the main appealing factor. I would say that the burrito NEARLY hit the spot as far as filling my belly, but maybe that's just me. I wanted just a little bit more, but I didn't want the bloat I get from a Chipotle burrito.

What I noticed most uniquely was the fresh, aromatic and pleasing smell and taste of the tortilla! Sounds strange I know, but it's definitely worth telling you about.

Bottom line: Help this family achieve the American dream, have a meal at Rudy's! They and your mouth will thank you!
