Went there for a dinner. Place was very reminicent of the kind of mexican restaurants my folks use to take me to growing up. Interior had very dim lighting, decor was appropriate, not over done. A nice break from the chain eateries. Ordered a combo and the tacos won! The best I have had since the Taco vans down in SoCal. Also, a must is the prepared to order guacamole. The waiter made it table-side, with input from us. It was delicious. Service was excellant, and noticed they had homemade sangria...For next time. A great place and kid friendly too. Also, the salsa and bean dip they put on the table with the warm chips was excellant too. Very nice a la carte menu, so easy to make it a $ instead of a $$.
