Took Mom here for Father's Day based upon a recommendation from a friend. From the outside it doesn't look like much, but once you walk in the vibe is quite nice. Definitely the look and feel of an authentic Mexican restaurant. Was a little disappointed that three TV's had the US Open on and not one had on FIFA Women's World Cup.

The place was semi-busy even though we got there when it first opened. They have Coke Zero too so that made the visit that much more awesome. Both Mom and I ordered the shredded chicken taco salad. They came back in less than ten minutes. Now that's fast! But, I have to admit I was skeptical with it coming back that fast. The server mentioned it was a simple process, that's why it was so fast. That didn't help matters for my skepticism.

It was actually pretty good. At first, the taste was not what I was used to. The chicken tasted a little funny, at first. But after a few bites, I couldn't stop eating! Overall it was pretty darn good. And they serve chips, refried beans, salsa, onions and jalepenos while you wait for your food. Good thing because I was starving!

I will definitely come back to try something else on the menu. Until then, four stars. Have to explore the menu. As far as customer service, it was extremely good. And they do not rush you to order or pay, for that matter. Great spot!
