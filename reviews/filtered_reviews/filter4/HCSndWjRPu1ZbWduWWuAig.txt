the best margaritas i've ever had... fresh fruit, and a tasty aftertaste

despite the huge probability of this being an americanized version on mexican food, the corn chowder tasted pretty authentic - definitely NOT from a can like the soup i had at another place...

nice portions (except for the crab cakes), and awesome chips/salsa... definitely a good place to dine...
