Loved it! It's so colorful and chill. Perfect place to relax with a cocktail and friends. The staff is amazing. Their menu is pretty great. I ordered the Sonoran dog torta which was delicious. It had 2 sliced hot dogs, salsa, bacon, and beans. My husband had pork belly tacos and they were perfect. Crispy and delicious. 

The ultimate winners here are the drinks.they are very well-balanced and thought out. My husband had the Basil drop and it was pretty refreshing. I had the Dangerous Liaison which could write possibly be one of my favorite cocktails ever. It had tequila, bourbon, aperol, and a citrusy juice. Talk about a heavenly buzz...

Oh and the music. Did I ment√≥n the music? They had a live dj who was cranking them out like there was no tomorrow. I had a hard time leaving cause I heir wanting to listen to whatever he was going to play next. I went on a Sunday evening, so I'm not sure if they  only have a dj on Sundays or if it's an everyday thing.
