Oh bomberro burrito how I love you so.  

Their homemade spicy sauce is the tastiest blend of hot spicy flavor and sweetness that I've ever had.  It's basically ketchup with lots of spice, but wow is it good.  They should package this stuff and sell it!  

I order the carne asada, but I'll warn you it isn't the best carne asada I've ever had.  It's above average, but sometimes overcooked.  It lacks sufficient marination and seasoning to be considered among the elite carne asada in the valley, but it's fresh and grilled to order, so you can't complain.

Their fish tacos are above average as well as their other tacos.  Their rice and beans are average as well, but nothing spectacular.

It's a bit over hyped, but I would recommend it just for the bomberro burrito and decent prices.
