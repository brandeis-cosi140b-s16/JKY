Read the great reviews so I headed over to taste for myself. Food first: Fat Boy does make a tasty hamburger. I had a cheese boyger with bacon and an egg (perfectly fried over hard) and fat fries combo for $8 something. It was definitely a 4 star burger for the price. About on par with the Fatburger chain, but a Fatburger combo with bacon and egg is like $13 bucks. And that makes Fat Boy a spot-on 4 star! The owners/workers were prompt and friendly and know how to do burgers on a flattop. But the dining area is small and lackluster which drops the overall score down. But the food is what you'll go for, and this is definitely a worthy stop if you're on that side of town.
