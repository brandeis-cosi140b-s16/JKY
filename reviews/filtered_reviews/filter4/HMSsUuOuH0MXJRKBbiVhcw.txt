Diablos. Oh man. That wheel, though!  

I arrived on a Friday night just in time for happy hour (about 4pm). I didn't really know what I was getting myself into other than a decent drink special. Of course upon our arrival the "wheel" was on $5 patron shots. Okay!  My work wives and I decided this was just what we needed to loosen up post conference. Apparently the happy hour wheel gets spun every 30-minutes, each time highlighting a different drink special. So it began.. $5 patron shots quickly followed by $6 margaritas, $3 fireball shots, $4 domestic beers... And eventually we lost count and cannot remember the rest of the happy hour specials we indulged in. Ouch! 

One thing I do remember is the nachos!  Those were HUGE and amazing!  For the same price you can choose chicken, steak or a combo of both. Lots of tasty meat, fresh guac, sour cream, pico, olives, jalape√±os, and a house HOT sauce!  Yumm. Between 4 gals, we didn't even get through this gargantuan!  

Anyway, if you find yourself on the strip in search of a cheap happy hour in a really fun atmosphere, wander into diablos, sit at the bar, wait for the wheel to spin, and order some nachos - you won't be disappointed. 

Pro tip: check in on yelp and see the hostess for your 2 for 1 tap beer or wells drink to add just another layer to the diablos deal!
