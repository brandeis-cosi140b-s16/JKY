Two words . . .  HAPPY HOUR!

Some of the reviews say dinner is overpriced.  Well, I have been to Barrio once for happy hour and it was pretty awesome!  Friday, we cut out of work early and went straight to Barrio.  Not too busy, staff was friendly and the place was clean.  I enjoyed looking at the art on the walls.

Happy hour is M-F, 3-5.  Half price drinks (ALL drinks) and $1.50 tacos.  Incredible!  There are eight different tacos: chicken, pork, carne asada, duck, shrimp, halibut, poblano pepper, and chorizo.  We couldn't decide so tried one of each.  Four tacos for each of us at $12.  Add on an order of guacamole and a few drinks, the two of us walked out of there full, buzzed, and happy at just over $40.
 
Again, I haven't been for dinner or lunch, so I can't comment on that end.  I can say that I would go back for happy hour any day . . . in fact, I am looking forward to it!
