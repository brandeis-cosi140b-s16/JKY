This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants. Although the parking lot is cramped, the location and atmosphere are pleasant enough. My wife and I still love the Patron margaritas (which have become somewhat expensive lately). As noted by another poster, the chips and salsa are average...What keeps me coming back are the chile rellenos. Furthermore, at F & L, they apply just enough, but not too much sauce (your choice, green or red sauce, they're both good). This is not haute quisine... just good, hearty down-home food. We will return...
