The food being served from within a restaurant can partially be defined by the feeling of its surroundings. For this, Revo is a definite 5 stars...or more if you count all the star lighting from the ceiling! Okay, okay...I can't deny that I'm a fan of Hayes Studio and Cathy Hayes. You know...Delux next door and Modern Steak...each giving off similar vibes only themed differently.

I had two tacos - shredded beef and carne asada. Each was served on double corn tortillas with salsa fresca. The meat was excellently seasoned and i was partial to the shredded beef. They also are 'known' for their lemonade, so I couldn't pass up the seasonal white peach lemonade! Definitely a memorable food element to mix within a quaint Mexican food joint.

Overall, it felt like a healthier spin on traditional Mexican food so it's guiltless. I'd definitely stop in again if I was in the area, it was a great place for lunch. It's quite small inside, but ordering "to go" would be a great option!
