Este' Yummy (I know, my Spanish is horrible, what can I say, I'm Canadian!) I love this place...

You know those nights when no one wants to cook and everyone is hungry and your close to broke...where should you go....HERE! LOL. You get so much food for the money and they even start you off with a tasty noodle soup and chips and beans. Everything I have tried from here has been great and everyone I have brought there has loved it.

Most nights they even have live music and the bands will come right up to your table to sing. Issss very niiiiice.

The atmosphere is very Latin and full of color and spirit. They have a full bar area as well as dining for the family. 

You got Ta - Co ( like to go :)
