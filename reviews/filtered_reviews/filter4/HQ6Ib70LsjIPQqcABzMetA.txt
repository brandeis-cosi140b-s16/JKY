Solid neighborhood taco joint with a very unique menu.
Order at the counter with a very friendly cashier (/owner?). Chips and salsa came up promptly and our food wasn't far behind.
As everyone has suggested, the mole is the thing to get here. Agreed. We tried the mole enchiladas and they were quite good. Also, the green chicken enchiladas were a solid green choice - very limey and vinegary, just how I like it. I already forgot the name of our last dish, but I think I liked it the best. It was like 2 little pulled pork sandwiches with a creamy sauce. Saronas or something like that. The meat was not too stringy, which is a big selling point for the kids.
Prices were ~$8 per dish and the enchiladas came 2 to a plate with rice and beans. Plenty filling.
Definitely a go-to casual Mexican spot in the area.
