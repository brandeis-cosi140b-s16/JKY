Went for lunch yesterday.....the reviews we right on, things were spicy, just the way I like it. It was funny as I looked around the dining room folks were sniffing from runny noses, awesome! Its the first time I ever had hot (temperature wise) dipping sauces for my chips...I'm not complaining just different. I like them all but after munching on them for about 15 minutes the red was in the lead followed closely by green hatch(hottest). Keep in mind this appetizer of chips and dips has the power to fill you up. My main entree with the Deluxe combination platter...it was too much food especially after over doing it on the chips/dips. The star for me was the red chili con carne. Solid rice and re-fried beans.
I didn't care for the tamale as much and the cheese enchilada was just taking up space.
Now that I know what its all about I can be more selective when I go back.
