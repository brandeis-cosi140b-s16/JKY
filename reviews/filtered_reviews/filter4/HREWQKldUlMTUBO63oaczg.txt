The Cabo Wabo Cantina is one of my favorite places to visit every time I go to Las Vegas! 

They have an awesome deck that is right on the strip just outside of Planet Hollywood.  One of the best people watching areas in the country!  Combine that with awesome service, solid food and great drinks and you've got yourself a great time!

Our most recent visit was on 10/20/14.  We were pleasantly greeted and opted for a table right on the rail so we could enjoy the sights.  I will say that they now pump in music...and my previous choice of the bar style seating is now less desirable because the music would be a bit loud there (wait, did I just say that?  music is NEVER too loud..but you get what I mean).

Our server, Ashley, was very nice, kept our drinks filled and provided great service....consistent with every single time we've visited Cabo Wabo! 4 or 5 times there and we've always been very well taken care of.

I tried a few different drinks...a cucumber based margarita...a 'sangarita' (their twist on a sangria, it's pinot noir and tequila) which was better than I anticipated but probably wouldn't get it again, and the standard ol' Waborita, which is my ultimate favorite.

The food is consistently good.  You DO have to pay for chips and salsa (only a couple bucks though) and the salsa is worth it..very tasty.  I used to get the tequila shrimp, but they've removed it from the menu so this time I had the fish tacos (with chipotle crema), while my date had the carne asada tacos (which looked and were delicious..and included avacado!).  It's not 5 star food, but it's way better than normal bar food.

Ultimately it's the combination of location, atmosphere, service, drinks and food that makes Cabo Wabo a winner.  Grab a seat on the rail, a Waborita and enjoy the sights and sounds of the Vegas strip!
