Best margaritas in town. Go with the frozen margarita with chambord, it's by far their best. You also can't go wrong with the Trio appetizer - it's a combination of mild salsa, queso, and guacamole. Additionally, their diablo chicken pasta is pretty tasty - just enough spice to get you through the night! I can't wait to make another trip back to Arizona!
