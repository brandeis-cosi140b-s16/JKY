Went to Los Tacos with my eCommerce/Interactive Marketing team.  I always have higher standards for taqueria joints because of my fiance.(Mexican family = FANTASTIC Mexican food)

Although I am partial to the tacos that his abuela and mama makes, I do have to admit that these were some pretty good darn tacos.  I could taste the guacamole and the crema.  Mmmm mmm mmm!  The carne asada had a very good grill/char flavor and the Al Pastor?  Oh man!  Delish!  Did I mention that although the tacos start off at $3.00 (not including guac, crema or cheese)- the tacos are HUGE.

A bottle of their green sauce (verde) is at every table.  Napkin holders at every table as well.  Why?  Because these tacos are so huge, you'll have to just grab a hold of them and dive right in.  Wipe your fingers and lips later!  Grab a fork to get the remnants that drop to the bottom of your little tray.

Everyone I went with had the chicken tacos.  I'll have to try that next time and bring the fiance down.
