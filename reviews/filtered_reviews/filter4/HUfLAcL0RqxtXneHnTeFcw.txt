I ate here with my husband and 2 sisters in law earlier this month. We got the table right in the corner by the street, which was great for people watching. We all really liked our food and our waitress was fantastic. The only downfall was not enough shading, causing us to maneuver the table and chairs so we were all mostly covered from the blistering sun. It was pretty expensive as well, but that is Vegas for you.
