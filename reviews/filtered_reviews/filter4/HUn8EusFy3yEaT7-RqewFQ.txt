Really, whats not to like?  Well, read on. . .

The downstairs bar is nice and cozy with a fire going and a copper bar top.  This is exactly the type of place I loved to go to back home in the winter when it was snowing outside.  The bartenders are super friendly.  The small plates are $5 during happy hour (although their drink special happy hour and food happy hour don't overlap) but like Melissa said you have to sit directly at the bar.  (Not next to it, not across from it, AT the bar.)  If you're one of those people who don't like small plates because you need to shove a ridiculous amount of food in your mouth, this is your place.  The small plates all had very generous portions, especially for $5.  

The name Rokerij comes from a set of cafes in Amsterdam, so this restaurant is a "smokehouse" (haha) that specializes in steaks and other grilled meats.  If you venture to the restaurant upstairs you are overwhelmed with the wonderful smell of grilled meats.  We had two small plates with beef tenderloin and they were both great.  Even the seafood dishes were very good - scallops, crab, shrimp, ceviche (though it was not a traditional ceviche and was a little sweet).

There were two things not to like.  1- The couple sucking face behind us on the couch.  I don't understand why grown adults have to act like teenagers in restaurants.   2- The roach that was crawling across the bar that my husband had to kill.  To thier credit, the bartender was grateful and thanked my husband for "looking out"
