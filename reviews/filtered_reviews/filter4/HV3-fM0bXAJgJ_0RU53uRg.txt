Was having a lunch date and decided to buy a groupon for Casa Don Juan. I wasn't really expecting too much out of the food or service reading some of the most recent reviews on yelp. BUT I was pleasantly surprised! 

Before we ordered I told our lovely server that I had a groupon. There were no hiccups at all and she explained that we could order anything on the menu. 

Our food came out fresh and fast!! I couldn't believe how fast or lunch was on the table...the place was hit with a nice lunch rush and our server had everything under control. I ordered the tamale and taco combo. The tamale was just okay...the masa was a bit to thick for my liking. But nothing to gripe about. 

Also ordered a blended mango margarita. Now that was delicious! It was blended to perfection and did not have any ice chips. 

Not sure if Casa Don Juan is my favorite mexican joint to eat at but I am sure I will return.
