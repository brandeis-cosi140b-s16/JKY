Some of the food you would expect to be larger for the price. However - the food is really delicious and the drinks are great as well. I don't recommend the quesadilla because it's not a quesadilla it's like a tamale or something. The corn and enchiladas are great! It's overpriced but you pay for the atmosphere. It's very chic and they softly play cool EDM lounge-esque music. My girlfriend and I are frequents for the time being because all service industry folk get 50% for you and who you're with!!!!! Now thats a good price.
