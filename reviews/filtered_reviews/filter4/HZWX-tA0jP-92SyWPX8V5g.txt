Oh Pollo Fundido where have you been all of my life.
I have never actually eaten here until recently. My company always gets party trays from here for our holiday open house and they are always very good and very popular with the guests and employees.
One day last month a coworker says we should go to this place for lunch. They are having a special on their Pollo Fundido. What is that? Oh it is really good. You should try it. Ok. Let's go. Hope it is good. We get there at lunch time and the place is hopping. Pretty busy. Get up to the counter after a little bit of a wait and say the secret password to get the deal. Food comes out just a few minuets after the order is placed and it is back to the office to eat.
First bite: WOW THIS IS REALLY GOOD! Mmmmmmm. How did I not know about this. My coworker tells me that Someburros Pollo Fundido is good but another place makes it better. Better than this? I don't know if I could handle that because this is really good. I have had it a few times now and it is still just as good as the first time. I don't know if I will ever get to try anything else on the menu because the Pollo Fundido is so good. Maybe one day.
Why are you still sitting there reading this? Get over there now and order one. Do it. Right now. But it is after lunch. So go anyway. It can be a second lunch or an early dinner. But they are closed. So sit outside of the door and wait for them to open. Just get over there and try one now. Right now. Go. Pollo Fundido!!!!!!
