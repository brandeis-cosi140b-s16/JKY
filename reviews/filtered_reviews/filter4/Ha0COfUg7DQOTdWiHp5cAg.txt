a disclaimer: i am familiar neither with the AZ food scene nor with the typical organic, upscale interpretation of southwestern food.  in fact, though i normally eat pretty well, dripping and sloppy tacos and burritos are my most frequent indulgence.  the few times i've tried similar places in san francisco, i've left unfulfilled and repented at the altar of the greasy taqueria.

not this time.

our items arrived quickly, a rainbow of glistening peppers, meats, herbs and sauces.  the tortilla soup was rich and filling with flavorful interjections of crema and some chunky guac i stole from another platter.  my taquitos came with habanero guac, which was a creamier, albeit barely hotter version.

scan the menu: the chef worked hard to distinguish the items during both their creation and their individual preparation.  i would have loved to have tried many more things just to sample all of the intended flavor combinations.

i guess i'll just be back!
