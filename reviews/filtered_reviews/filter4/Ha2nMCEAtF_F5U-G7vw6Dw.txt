Had lunch here and it was really good.  I had the carne asada tacos and my friend had the pastor tacos.  Mine were really good and he said his were as well.  Reminded me of authentic street tacos from Mexico and not the more Americanized versions that most places have.  Note: corn tortillas standard, not flour tortillas, and they don't gunk up the plate with mounds of chees covered refried beans and starchy rice (this is a good thing).  There are plenty of places to go for that type of Mexican food if you want, but this has a much more authentic feel and taste to it.

Plus, they have really cool artwork on the walls for sale.

Only problem was that parking was not sufficient for the lunch crowd.

Really enjoyed it and will go back.
