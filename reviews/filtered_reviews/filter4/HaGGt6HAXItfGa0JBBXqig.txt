First, I would llike to say that I love spicy food and Arriba's delivers. My favorite is the White Sands Chimichanga which is covered in the best queso fundido sauce I have ever experienced. This dish probably should have 2.5 to 3 peppers next to it to let you know it is spicy. I also like the Hatch Chicken Especial and the Pollo Al Diablo. Yes Diablo means it is muy caliente! Charro beans are great I could make a meal of these with a tortillo to sop up the juice. The rice is fluffy and has good flavor. Although I pour some of thier delicious salsa ove my rice, cuz that's how I like it. The bean dip is also excxellant. I usually fill up on chips, salsa and bean dip and can only eat half my meal, but thats ok, because I get a great lunch the next day. I always have this meal with a Grande Patron Margarita with Grand Mariner floated on top. 2 of these makes a great happy hour anytime of day. My only con would be the Carnitas, great flavor but not much meat.
