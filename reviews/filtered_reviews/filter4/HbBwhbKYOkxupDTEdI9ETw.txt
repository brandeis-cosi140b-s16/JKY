First night in Vegas. Saw the fountains then headed over for a drink. Just for checking in on yelp I got a free voucher for a margarita with the purchase of an entree. I don't like margaritas but as a teacher getting something for free brings a smile to my face. 

We sat at the inside bar
Waiting for a seat on the rail outside so we could watch everything. There was a band upstairs also. This place is owned by Sammy Hagar and his beer Red Head is on draft. If your in Vegas it's worth a stop.
