I have rode by this place many times in NODA and I finally got the opportunity to eat here on Thursday for lunch. Me and my sister had a FAB time!

The corn salsa and chips they bring out while you wait for your food are great. I had the Lemon Grilled Tuna Tacos with Baja Rice. The tacos were filling and the rice was cooked well. The sauce that goes on top of the rice was really sweet as well. My sister got the Lemon Grilled Shrimp Tacos with black beans and rice. I'm not a fan of black beans, but I got myself a little bite of my sister's shrimp tacos and they were good. 

I believe the next time we go, I'm definitely going to try the Beer Battered Shrimp Tacos! This is one place I will return to again and again.
