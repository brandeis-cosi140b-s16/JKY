I come here at least once a week. Cafe Rio is slightly above Chipotle when it comes to the freshness and quality of their ingredients. Consequently, their prices are also a little higher but I really like how consistently fresh their steak salads are. If you are health conscious like me, get the salad without chips and tortilla; that will cut down at least 600+ calories.
