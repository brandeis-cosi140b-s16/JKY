The tuna tacos were awesome. They almost always have a wait, but if you are not in a hurry it is well worth it. The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The only thing that kept them out of 5 starts is the fact that they didn't accept call aheads. They have a large selection of local beers that are found in every bar in NoDa. I would go there again if I'm in town.
