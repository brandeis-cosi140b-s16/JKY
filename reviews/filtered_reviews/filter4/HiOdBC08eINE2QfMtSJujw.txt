Dear Mr. Betos:  After finding an unidentifiable object in my guac that tasted suspiciously like a piece of rotting chicken judging from the millisecond it was in my mouth, you've given me a reason to look to your neighbor to the south for my grease fix.

Hello Fiesta Burrito.  We ordered our staples of rolled tacos and a carne asada burrito for comparison to Los Betos.  Both fine establishments have the ever-so-popular styrofoam tip jar taped outside the drive-thru window.  Fiesta Burrito is actually a little bit cheaper for the same items, if you can believe it.  While I would say Betos has better flour tortillas IMO, the food at Fiesta seemed just a little fresher, although equally as artery clogging.

So for now, I'm going to give the edge to Fiesta, and drive the extra 2 miles to try it again.  But don't worry Mr. Betos, I'll be back to see you too.  I have a big heart, and there's room enough for you both.
