Worth any wait,  ours was minimal.  Horchata and salsa bar were great highlights! 

Loved the decor and character of the place.  Dia del morte all about including cool mosaic tile art. We walked right up past the bar to look up menus and wait on a table.  No tables available.  I was directed to use the men's room.  Which was decorated yet cluttered with a music stand,  stool,  and supplies.  I couldn't open the slider lock easily and had feared they'd have to break the door down but I got lucky and got out.   By the time I got out,  only a few minutes,  my friend was seated.  Tunes were good,  Even when I couldn't understand the music I was grooving. 

Menu was a bit overwhelming with so many choices.  Got the best horchata ever with strawberries, cantaloupe, and pecans.  It was mammoth. 

Settled in on a fish taco and Mahi Mahi,  both grilled.  They were hot to handle,  and a bit over filled.  Nice because good value,  but the bottom tortillas were soggy. 

Only got two bites of this delishness in,  because I filled up on chips and fun salsas from the salsa bar.  The horchata contributed too. 

The peanut salsa was the hottest,  and the salsa de albor was my first experience with this fruity hot Mexican Chile.  The jicama was nice and refreshing and cooling but very hard to get on the chip as by its nature wasn't saucy.  However the cilantro was too soupy so I could only pour it on.  The pecan wasn't spicy like the peanut and was therefore nice against the heat as well.
