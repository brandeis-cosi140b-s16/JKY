Casa Don Juan offers a pretty standard Tex-Mex menu -- burritos, enchiladas, tacos, etc.  And they do a good job with the standards, so they're starting out with 3 stars.  Why 3 stars already?  Because Mexican food is awesome.  And you will get a pretty good version of whatever Mexican dish you order from here.  Not life-changing, but good, Tex-Mex comfort food.  

The extra star comes from the restaurant's staff.  I've been there for lunch a few times and in the evening during First Friday events once or twice.  Each time I've been there, the wait staff is friendly and outgoing.  Talking to them generally brightens my day (I work downtown, I need brightening).  Even in the middle of a lunch rush, they are very attentive (last time I was there, they refilled my iced tea so many times that I almost burst).

And if you go at lunch, the owners are often around checking in with tables to make sure everything was good. Hey, family-owned places are becoming rarer in Vegas.  I'm a fan of comfort food done well and great customer service.  Check and check.
