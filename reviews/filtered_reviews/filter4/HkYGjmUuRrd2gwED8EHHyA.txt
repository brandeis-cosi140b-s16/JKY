We were pleasantly surprised by how good the food was!

Every time we have tried to come here there is a serious wait to get in. I would suggest making reservations. We finally decided to stick it out and wait because Popo's is so close to our house and we needed a good Mexican restaurant!

I'm so glad we did! My husband inhaled the chips and salsa; our poor waiter had to bring chip refills about 5 times. They were delicious! I ordered the combo plate with the Green Chicken Enchilada and Chicken Taco (with rice and beans). So much food for such a great price! And all so good! Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal. I can't wait to go back and try something new... or I might have to order the same thing because it was amazing 

We left with happy bellies and a happy wallet!
