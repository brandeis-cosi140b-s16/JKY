Ohhhh El Zocalo....where have you been mi amigo?
  I have been searching for this restaurant to savor for some time. I just didn't know its name. I sat at the bar since I was flying solo. I queried the camarero as to the different Tequilas in their selection. He said they had 250!!!! I couldn't sample them all so I asked for his guidance for a favorite. He suggested Don Parillo which was good. All I can say is suavamente.....it went down like turpentine with a hint of kerosene. No actually it was good, but this isn't your college chug a lug tequila. It was actually very funny because when he brought it out in a snifter the lady next to me asked what it was. I told her and she said...."oh, I like Jose Cuervo". 
  Anyway, for dinner I had the Pollo Asada which came covered in green chile. I didn't complain but never had it that way before. By the end of the meal and a Modelo Especial in hand listening to the live music of the troubadour, it took me back to a place far far away. Probably 100 miles south of here...somewhere.
  If you like traditional Mexican food, live music, knowledgeable bartenders, a huge selection of good to fine tequila, then look no further.
