Folks, if you visit Phoenix and are in the mood for Tex-Mez you must try out Canyon Cafe. I had the lunch portion of the Enchiladas, rice and green salad and it was great. The lunch portion was perfectly presented, portioned and prepared. Jennifer did and outstanding job of serving and I was very happy I found you for lunch. 

Keep up the great work!
