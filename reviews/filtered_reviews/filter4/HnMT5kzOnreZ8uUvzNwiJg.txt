Yummy, yummy, yummy!  My family and I have been eating at Carolina's for about 12 years now.  It is truly delicious mexican food.  They have the best beans, tortillas and enchilada sauce in town!  I cannot get enough of their food.  My favorite meal is a bean & cheese burrito enchilda style with a butter tortilla on the side.  Try it, I promise you will thank me.  

This place is streaming with professional business people, police officers, firemen, construction workers and everyone in between.  The line is sometimes out the door on weekday lunch hour.  It is actually better to pre-call your order in, although the pick-up line can also pretty long at the lunch hour.  

The only reason I am giving the restaurant 4 stars is due to the location and building's interior/exterior.  It is in a pretty poor neighborhood in a crumbling building.  But hey...maybe that add's to the authentic appeal?  Another Carolina's recently opened up on Cactus & Cave Creek, same food but much nicer location.  

As an addendum to this review the food is definitely 5 stars - it is that good!  Try it!
