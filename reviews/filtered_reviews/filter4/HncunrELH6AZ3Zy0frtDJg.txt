Delicious hidden gem in Phoenix! I highly recommend any of the tacos. Carne asada were amazing and so is the breakfast. Guacamole is fresh but sort of bland. The shrimp cocktail is served in a glass and all mixed up with a tomato base, it's okay if your on a diet but I wouldn't go there again for it.
