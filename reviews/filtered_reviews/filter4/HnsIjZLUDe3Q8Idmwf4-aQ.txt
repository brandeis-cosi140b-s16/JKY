This is one of those places that when you see it for the first time, second time or eighth time that you will not stop and eat. 
It is located on Craig road near the I15 and right next to the Pilot truck stop on your way north. I made that mistake for to long and then finally convinced my self to try it. It has a small parking lot and even  walking to the door you are still not sure ... but when you enter - Oh Yes.
The decor is rustic with historical items placed around the large dining room and bar. The booths are great and the staff is very friendly. A great atmosphere with live music on most every night. ( keyboards or guitar) 
The traditional mexican food is super, the guacamole is out of sight and the sea food dishes are excellent. It is totally inexpensive and you will leave "Stuffed to the Max  - and happy that you are." 
It is well out of the way for most people, but if you have that need to visit the Cannery Casino, it is right on the way and should not be missed. 
Just don't let the location throw you off from the enjoyment of a supurb mexican dining experience.
