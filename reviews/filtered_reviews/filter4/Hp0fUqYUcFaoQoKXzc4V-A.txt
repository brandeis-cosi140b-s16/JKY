The tacos are the best in all of Scottsdale.  Seriously!!

They're the hard shelled kind ~ similar to the famous Tito's Tacos in Culver City..  BUT, I think they're better!  They load it with tons of juicy shredded beef and it's so delish!!

The free chips were nice and warm and paired well with the complimentary pico de gallo..  The salsa rojo was too watery (hence -1 *) but the awesome spicy carrots & jalapenos made up for it..

5 rolled tacos were also good.  They top it with thick guacamole and cheese so it's not messy and everything sticks to the taco while you're eating it..

I can't comment on anything else, so I'll just rave about the hard shelled tacos..  SOOOO good!
