This is as New Mexico as it gets. Everything from the Spanish tile on the floor to the decor and artwork in the building. This was my second time here and both times I left very satisfied with my meal and the service. As a warning you should like spicy foods if you are going to try this spot. The Adovado and New Mexican Enchilada are the 2 plates I have eaten. Both were really good. I am definitely making this a spot to stop at when craving a spicy dish. It can be pricy and is a bit upscale.
