I almost lost my faith in mexican food in Arizona. All of the "bertos" suck and I was finding places that didn't offer carne asada.. wth? Anyways, this place makes me less homesick. Food is yummy and prices are dirt cheap. I'm a really big fan of the #18! 2 carne asada burritos with beans and rice for $7.95! Just pour some pico de gallo on that burrito and it will hit the spot mmmm
