First meal after arriving in Vegas.  I had a most excellent burrito.  All the ingredients were fresh, and the spices and sauces were just right.  The burrito came with rice and beans, like most places.  These were good, although not spectacular.  I believe, however, that it would take a lot to make rice and beans above average!  I also had a pomegranate margarita -- delicious!  Hubby had the carnitas entree, which he loved.  A little spendy for Mexican, but you have to spend more than you're used to in Vegas for just about everything -- especially if you want something good.  

T&T has a terrific bar with many many types of tequila.  It looks like a good place to hang out with friends and down a few shots.  Speaking of which, they have tequila flights so you can sample a few and decide what you like!  

My only complaint about T&T was the service.  Our waiter, although friendly, was not very attentive.  We had to ask a couple times for our chips and salsa.  Our entrees came out very quickly, though.
