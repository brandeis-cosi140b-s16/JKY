I enjoyed Z tejas the other night for the first time. Being new here i had to learn whats good and whats not. So i started picking a new place everytime. So far out of the dozen or so places ive eaten it ranks up near the top. First of all the atmosphere is very inviting. The service was reasonably quick but not to quick to where you cant enjoy the conversation before the meal. The staff was also very friendly and accommodating. Now to the food. I ordered the diablo pasta and was rather impressed at how tasty it was. It was how it seems..... spicy. I really enjoyed the place just wish the drinks were made a lil stronger. Overall it was a good experience and would recommend it to others.
