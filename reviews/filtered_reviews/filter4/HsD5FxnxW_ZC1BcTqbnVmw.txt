I'm always happy when chips and salsa are brought before me.  And I become giddy with excitement when there are three salsas in front of my face.  Bonus points for Agave's salsa trio..

The chips and salsa here are yummy, but there's nothing exciting about the guacamole.  Certainly not worth $9.  My husband ordered the potato  and portabello tacos and although they are terribly messy we both enjoyed them.  I ordered the vegetable chile relleno and it was super awesome.  Definitely not a fried, cheesy relleno like you get most places... but more like a stuffed pepper.  Full of veggies and tortilla strips and even cactus...?  I dunno, but I was in love.

I love the atmosphere of Agave and it's a great place for either a romantic date or hanging out with a group of friends.  Right across the street from Red Rock Casino.
