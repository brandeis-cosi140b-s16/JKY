Was in the mood for mexican and wanted a quick bite before showtime so we took advantage of $5 happy hour specials and sat at the bar.  We got every appetizer on the menu and was pleasantly surprised.  You already get chips and salsa so probably didnt need to get the nachos.  I noticed people who just got drinks still got free chips and salsa.  The chips were good.  All was very good and fresh.  Our bartender was attentive and friendly.  We were in and out within 40 mins.  I am not giving 5 stars only because we did not really try a real menu or sit in the dining room so as to not deceive, I cannot give it a full rating for others to try but based on this experience, I would go again.
