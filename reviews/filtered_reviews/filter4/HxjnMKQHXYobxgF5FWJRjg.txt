GREAT HAPPY HOUR, GREAT CHIPS, CONSISTENTLY PRO SERVICE

I am not a person who craves Mexican food, so for me to put this place high on my list s a statement.

THE GOOD:  Happy hour is alive and packed with great value. The staff seem to amp up a bit too which makes it fun.  The staff is always impressively knowledgable about the menu and details in preparation, plus they are well trained.  He food is cravable.  With the exception of a guacamole that neither offends nor impresses and some mediocre ribs ( but my fault for ordering them at a Mexican restaurant), the menu is loaded with can't miss items.  If you go when the kitchen is slow, the manager may let you mix and match taco plates at the price of the most expensive.  The real hits are the fish tacos.  I love the grilled mahi but the fried mahi is very flavorful.  Do not miss the chips.  They come out hot and never soggy.  Pair them with the smokey salsa and beer-queso (skip the guacamole...average).  My favorite time to come here is mid-day or early dinner. Perfect neighborhood vibe.

THE BAD:  When this place gets crowded, the house tries to seat the patio.  This isn't a bad thing in those six months of great weather but the hostesses pressure guests to sit the patio on 105f nights and in the winter it's the frost. They will go out of there way to turn a mister or heater in season but I personally always feel that the pressure to sit ruins the rest.
