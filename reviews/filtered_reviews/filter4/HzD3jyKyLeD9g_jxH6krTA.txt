I loved the more casual atmosphere at this location and the fact that it's tucked into the Cosmo so you don't have a huge crowd coming in off the strip. The 'air margaritas' were strong and tasty. They may look small, but they're powerful. It was hard to choose from the menu because so much sounded wonderful. Ended up with chips and salsa, the habonaro salsa (major heat), chicken flautas, and a lunch special that was pretty much equivalent to a ham quesadilla. All so tasty! I didn't think we'd have time for dessert, but the sticky rice sans rice was calling to me.. Awesome way to end a meal- light, sweet, full of flavor. The fresh mango adds just enough sweetness to the dish. I could have eaten here everyday!
