Out of the, like, hundreds of taco shops in this area, I'm glad we tried this one....super good! This place is almost like the In-N-Out of taco shops; they only serve carne asada and al pastor (pork). They have tostadas, burritos, tacos all based around those two meats. 

You can get vegetarian options too, the beans are not made with lard, and they are super tastey! The tortillas are awesome too!
