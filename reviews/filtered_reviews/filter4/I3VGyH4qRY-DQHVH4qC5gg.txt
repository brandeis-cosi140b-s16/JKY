Airport food has a much earned reputation.  I have to say, I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food, drink and service here. 

Yes, sticker shock at looking at the menu (and the resulting tab). I had a margarita and it was served in a tall glass. I have to admit I was expecting more juice than Tequila - what a surprise!  I could taste the tequila in a well balanced margarita. They did well by my husbands gin martini too. 

I ordered the pork tacos and my husband had the chicken tacos. Yes. They were spicy. If you like heat - they were delicious!  The pork was their special slow roasted pork and very tasty. The chicken tacos had a delicious cream sauce. We chose the house salad.  The salad was made from salad greens and topped with onions, tomatoes and crumble cheese. The salad was lightly dressed with balsamic vinaigrette. Presentation was excellent. 

All in all, almost worth the price - 4 stars for great food - minus one star for pricing.
