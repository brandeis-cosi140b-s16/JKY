My first impression was not great because the red cushions on the chairs were pretty dirty.   I ordered 3 tacos $10.95 seafood, fish & shrimp.   It was really wonderful, a great light lunch.  The ingredient were very fresh and flavorful.  My spouse had Crab & mango salad $11.95 which is served with honey-lime vinaigrette.  It was a very attractive presentation and very tasty.  He would highly recommend it.  He also enjoyed a margarita.  They don't have a happy hour, which is to bad.
