We ate here prior to seeing Carrot Top since it is next to the showroom. Food and service was quite good. We had a reservation  so only waited 5 minutes to be seated. Four people in our party...two had chicken fajitas, one had shrimp tacos and everyone enjoyed their meal. I had combo #5 which consisted of a chile rellano, vegetable quesadilla and a 1/2 corn on cob that had spices on it which I really enjoyed. I gave this restaurant 4 stars instead of 5 because my food  was served luke warm not hot. We all had a marjarita which was good. Service was good and friendly. Make a reservation if you plan on eating here around showtime. I would definitely try again.
