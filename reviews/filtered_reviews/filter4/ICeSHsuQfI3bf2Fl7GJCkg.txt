Los Dos has been around for years and expanded across the valley.  This was my first time in this location and though I don't think it was as good as the one i grew up on (Central), it was still very good.  

The motto is "some like it hot" and Los Dos mean it!  They use authentic New Mexico hatch chilies which have great flavor but also pack a punch you will feel the rest of the day.

Chimichangas, burritos, enchiladas, and tacos are all safe bets here.  I recommend always getting a fried egg on top of the enchiladas to help with the heat and flavor!   

If you're a fan of New Mexico fare or curious to try it, Los Dos is a great choice!
