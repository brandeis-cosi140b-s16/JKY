This place is one of my favorite restaurants around. Anything you get here will never disappoint. The staff is always very nice and very quick to make your food. The facility is always clean and it's never too crowded. I love it!

The only downside I have to this place is the long line that is always there. At any given point in the day, you will encounter a line at his place. Fortunately, I'm a pretty faithful customer and I'll come back regardless of the lines
