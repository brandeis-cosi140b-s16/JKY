I am so glad to have finally found good Mexican food in Pittsburgh!  This place is wonderful.  They have a large selection of authentic Mexican dishes, and many vegetarian options.  

Chips and salsa come gratis, and the pint margarita ($2.99 on Mondays) I ordered was fantastic.  This place has drink specials every day, all day--even on weekends.  

I would give them 5 stars, but the service was sloooow.  It doesn't matter, though, we'll definitely be back for the food.
