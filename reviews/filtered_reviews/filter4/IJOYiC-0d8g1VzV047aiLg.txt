My overall thought about this place... hmmmm. definitely made for tourist. nothing too special. The mexican food was okay.. I've eating better tasting Mexican food back at home and it cost MUCH less than what we had to pay for here.
However,I have to say their service is legit. Our server, Ryan was a sweetheart.
A friend of mine spilled my senorita (very fruity cocktail) and it spilled all over me :(
He was able to get me a new drink on the house! Yay!

We were with a party of 6..
I ordered the lobster taco. was okay, kind of salty in my opinion. A friend of mine got the shrimp taco, was also a bit salty.
I can't remember what everyone else ordered.

One cool thing is that they have a mechanical bull inside!

Would give 3 stars for the food but service is legit~!
