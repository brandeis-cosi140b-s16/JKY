The Al Pastor had the perfect balance of sweet and heat. I will definitely have it again probably two! I also had the corn, Mexican street style, the paprika made the corn seem even sweeter. The staff was friendly and accommodating...I guess they just needed to see a smiling face to prompt them to offer assistance. Taco Y Taco will be on my lunch list favorites!
