I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to eat anything here, since I am a vegan. I was pleasantly surprised to see 'vegan tacos' on the menu. The tacos don't have a description on the menu, but they are 2 crisp lettuce cups filled with sauteed vegetables. The tacos come with a bowl of black beans. It was very satisfying. I was told by our waiter that the tortilla chips are fried in oil, not lard, but other reviewers had mentioned they are fried in lard. Not sure who's right on that one. We were will a group of 8 and we had great service for our dinner.
