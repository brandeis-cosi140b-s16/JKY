Menu is interesting, food is delicious.  All 4 of us very much enjoyed our meals. The only issue we had was service; it seemed like they were understaffed (maybe a few servers called in?) and though our server did ok, it was slower than expected. 

Bottom line, one of the best restaurants in Champaign and I'm excited to return!
