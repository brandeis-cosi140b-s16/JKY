Good authentic Mexican food with real tortillas! And I love that they serve their tacos Mexican style.

Looking forward to going back. I had the guisado chicken and my husband had the tinga chicken. Both were very tasty. Casa Reyna had a long list of meats for their tacos, so everyone can find something they like.
