Went for lunch with coworkers while in town. Found this place on yelp and wanted to give it a try. Unique building and even more interesting inside. I loved the stained glass windows. The service was just ok. We ordered the guacamole and queso duo, while at the same time ordering our lunch. Our tacos came before the appetizer bc the server forgot about it. Not a huge deal because the food came out fast, as did our late arriving appetizers. 

The chips and salsa where so good! The guacamole was good, more lime to taste than I'm use too, but very good. The queso was very good. We probably could have had a meal just from apps alone. 

For my lunch I got a trio of tacos. 1. Guild Chicken. 2. Yucatan Shrimp. 3. Chipotle Cherry Steak. All three were very good! My favorite was the steak. I could have easily eaten three of those also. For my side I got the corn. I had them take it off the corn for me so it came in a bowl. Very good. Not as messy. Full of flavor! 

Overall good meal. It was good to get away from the downtown meals that we had night after night in Phoenix. Would recommend you give it a try.
