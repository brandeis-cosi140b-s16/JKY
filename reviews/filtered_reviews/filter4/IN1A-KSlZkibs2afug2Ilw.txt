This place for happy hour is magical. All the apps are half off and they have good drink specials.

What to order. Nachos. Seriously. The quesadillas both beef and chicken had a good amount of meat and Street corn queso. 

What to think twice on: the cerviche. It was more of a shrimp cucumber salad with a cream based sauce. 
White wine sangria. Tastes like orange juice.
