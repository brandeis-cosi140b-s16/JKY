The food here is surprisingly good.  We had low expectations after trying the chips and salsa.  The salsa and guacamole are bland and boring and we don't end up eating them, but I thought the bean dip was addictive. My husband had the fajitas and the beef was really well seasoned.  I have had the carne asada tampiquena which was good, as well as cheese enchilada and pork tamale which I also enjoyed. They went a little masa heavy on the tamale but the meat was great. 

Wish they would improve their salsa, for sure, but we will definitely return.
