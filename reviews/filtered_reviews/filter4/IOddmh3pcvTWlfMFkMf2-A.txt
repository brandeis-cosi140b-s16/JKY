Good food, slow service. 
We're regulars here, the food is definitely worth coming back for. If you're hungry, come here there's big portions. But if you're starving, don't bother, the service can be really slow at times. There's a really nice atmosphere here. Especially in the summer time when you sit on the patio and listen to live music. The burritos are big and really filling and I'm also a big fan of the pork enchiladas. Really good margaritas and pina coladas too!! Definitely would give this place 5 stars if they would speed up their service.
