Food and drink was absolutely fantastic! The Mex-Asian fusion is done perfectly!  The Sumo Maya mojito is amazing. We tried about 6 things on the menu and all voted that the Sea Bass was unanimously the best Sea Bass we have ever had!
I give it a 4 star because I wasn't  impressed with our service providers.  They were not friendly, and acted very stuck-up.  Just didn't seem like they enjoyed nor had any fun at their job!
