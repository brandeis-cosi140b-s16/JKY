Love this place. My gf and I went today after accidentally finding it next door to a hardware store we went to go get keys made at. Staff was very friendly and very attentive. A very latest back environment where any dress code is acceptable. 

The food wasn't five star. We ordered the queso dip for an appetizer, which if you are into instant gratification, then this is right up your alley, because I could feel my arteries clog with each bite. It was great. A big pile of freshly fried tortilla chips sprinkled with melted cheese and a hot skillet with a greasy mess of five different cheeses all mixed together. Filling and probably best split between at LEAST two people. 

In ordered the chicken burro platter which was more than I could eat; and let me tell you, I can eat. It was huge chunks if moist and tender chicken wrapped on a tortilla smothered in green chilli. Even the rice and beans were good. Most Mexican restaurants the rice and beans are just a waste of space but in left no bean unturned when filling my to-go box. 

Jen had the Machaca Taco plate to the same effect. The meat was seasoned well and was moist and cook perfectly. 

We has a NA beverage each, an appetizer, our entrees, and the bill with 20% tip was barely $40; and it covered both our lunches for tomorrow. 

I can't wait to go back and try some of the other dishes I've been reading about.
