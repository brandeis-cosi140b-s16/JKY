A lot of the reviews don't really give this place enough love. 4 stars, not 5 because of price. It's a little pricey for what you get. But hey, that's the Vegas way anymore. The food was good. We opted for the table side guac and shared an enchilada. Portions are fair and filling. The staff is extremely friendly. And the manager, Kevin, stopped by our table and asked how the meal was. Also, location is good. Near the casino and the monorail if you aren't staying at the MGM. I'd come back if I win more at the slots!
