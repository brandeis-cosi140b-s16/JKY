I know there is a lot of hype around Los Reyes de la Torta and I am here to tell you that they are the real deal! I was very suspicious when I first arrived but I really enjoyed my dinning experience. Not fussy. Not fancy. The serve cans of soda. Service was above average. Just great food. I really appreciate the large variety of TORTAS! I can't wait to go back.
