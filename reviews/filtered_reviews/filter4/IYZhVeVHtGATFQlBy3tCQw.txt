I love this place. I have been eating at the original one on 16st and palm ln for about 2 years. This one is even better!  I love the quesadillas. Not your moms quesadilla!  I almost always get th he chicken mole in the quesadilla.  Love it. I have tried almost everything.  I would also recommend chicken Tinga. Shrimp tacos are awesome. Try all 20 of the salsas. Including,  pecan, hicima.  Green toatilllo is awesome. The Margaritas are fresh with chunks of fruit! Yummy! Enjoy.
