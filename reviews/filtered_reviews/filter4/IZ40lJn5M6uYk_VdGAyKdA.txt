The Mr. and I have been on the hunt lately for the the best menudo and posole in Maricopa County. I wouldn't say they're the best, but both are delicious here. Portion sizes are large but you can order the 1/2 size  for the menudo. The posole had a rich chicken broth flavor, a good amount of hominy, and had a big chunk of beef spine. The menudo was good. It had a good ratio of hominy to broth and plenty of tripe.  Their was too much "stuff" and not enough broth. I especially liked that they bring you plenty of fixings with your order. The horchata was good but had a little too much cinnamon for my liking. The service was good and the restaurant was clean. Overall, I'd come back!
