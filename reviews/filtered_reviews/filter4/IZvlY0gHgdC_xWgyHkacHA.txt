Ordered the steak picado! Deliciously well cooked steak to perfection! Because I'm Mexican, I'm always looking for a legit Mexican food place. Rice and beans..not so much. Nothing authentic about them. Margaritas eh..not impressed. Would of liked more zest for my buck!! Overall a very fine dining experience. Pricey but it's Vegas what you expect.
