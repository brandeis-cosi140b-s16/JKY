The hubs and I stopped in here one evening a whim. We were on our way to a show, didn't have much time and it was in the neighborhood.  The parking lot was packed which we figured meant the food had to be tasty. 

We walked in and the restaurant was full, which left me wondering if we'd get out of there in time (I soon realized I had nothing to worry about).  We were quickly seated and supplied with a warm bowl of nachos and salsa.  Yum!  Off to a good start.  

They had a good selection of vegetarian items on the menu which was great but made it was hard to choose.  Our waiter took our order and left us to munch on the tasty chips and salsa while we waited.  Dinner arrived lickety-split and was piping hot (hot plate!).  My spinach enchiladas were so tasty and my husband enjoyed his veggie enchiladas.  With plenty of time to spare, we had some delicious rice pudding for dessert.  

The food is great, the service is fast and the prices are right.  We'll definitely be back.
