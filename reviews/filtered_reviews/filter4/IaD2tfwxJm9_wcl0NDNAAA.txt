I heard of this and had to try it. Korean mexican fusion oh my it was delicious. A little mom n pop place that serves huge portions of great food at an even better price. At table of 5 and we all ordered plates 2 appetizers and an extra plate of rice and we only paid 65.00. Anything with the bulgogi and you can't go wrong. The bulgogi flautas and the chicken fried rice were my favorites.  We got lucky and got a table quick but it soon filled up and there was a wait. You must try this place.
