First time at this location was for a complimentary LV Weekly Tequila Appreciation Tasting. 
Besides an in depth lesson on tequila making & tasting with reps from el jimador & Herradua, we also got to enjoy chips & salsa, guac & chips and a taco bar. The salsa was good, the guac was lacking in flavor and the beef tacos were very good. The rice and hot salsa with the tacos was also very tasty. The menu has a nice variety and the one margarita I had at the tasting (some fruit flavor) was very tasty. 
The restaurant is located in the Forum Shops lower level and was hard to find, as it's near the spiral staircases which to me are out of the way from everything.
