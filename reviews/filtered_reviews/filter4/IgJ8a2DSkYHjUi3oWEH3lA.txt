We were in Vegas to avoid Caramgeddon in LA last weekend. It was after midnight and we tried to get some pizza at Metro but they just closed. We were driving past the Hard Rock Hotel and since I have had Pink Taco on my list of places to eat, we decided to give them a try. The place is very trendy and since all the costumers in there looked like rock musicians I felt a little out of place. The wait staff was very friendly though. 

They have a late night menu with about a dozen item on it. The corn tamales and taquitos were vegetarian friendly so we gave them a try. The tamales were amazing. The taquitos were ok. 

Parking is the same as for the hotel and casino. Valet is the easiest if you don't mind waiting for your car. 

We may come back again but not for just Pink Taco. We were tired and wanted to head back to our room on the Strip, so we did not get to see all the great music memorabilia at the Hard Rock. Another trip and better planning.
