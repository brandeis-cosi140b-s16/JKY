Great lunch spot! Wonderful healthy options for Mexican food including gluten free, whole wheat tortillas, brown rice, and vegetarian. The helpings are plentiful and the price is decent. 

The only downside is it is pretty small, so if you go right around the lunch rush, it is packed and there may not be anywhere to sit. Other than that, it's great! One of my favorites.
