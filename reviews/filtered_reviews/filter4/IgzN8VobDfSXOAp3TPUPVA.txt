"Simple food cooked with fresh ingredients and passion, is sometimes the best food you can find"
FOOD: My husband and I had 4 Al Pastor and after a free testing of Buche also had 4 of those. The meats tasted great, they were hot to the touch and juicy as if just recently cooked. The tortillas were also soft but not to the point were they would break with the heavy weight of the meats and toppings. The salsas, both the red and green were very tasty, not too hot not to mild. The mulas, which we had never had before are actually an upgrade from a regular quesadilla, which we loved! The addition of melted cheese along with the meats and fresh guacamole made them a wonderful experience.

SERVICE: Service was exceptional, not only did they explain every cut of meat but offered a free tasting so we knew what we were ordering. Yes, there are other Tijuana Style tacos out there, but the personal service and attention to detail made this one our best experiences yet.
SITTING AREA: I agree with the other reviewer, sitting may be an issue during peak times, but we were there at approximately 6pm on Thursday and we had a table with no issues.
PRICE: You can not beat a total bill of under $20 dollars for 8 tacos, 2 mulas and two free-refill drinks, to include Aguas Frescas if you choose, amongst the variety of sodas.
You can definitely bring the family for a great time and they will be full!

My only concern is that as with other "recently opened" places they will change in time, cut on the servings, forget about the customer service and raise their prices....unfortunately we have seen it too many times with both restaurants and grocery stores. As for now, you have new faithful customers who will pass on the great experience to others!
