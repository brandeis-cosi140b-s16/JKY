On a warm summer afternoon, there are only a few things that are more soul satisfying than chips and salsa, chicken fajitas and an ice cold margarita! This restaurant rightfully has "tequila" in their name, because they make one sick firecracker margarita!! Made with jalape√±o infused tequila and lime juice, it's one of the most refreshing drinks I've had... with a kick!! (I think I may have finally found my favorite beverage.) For those of you who aren't afraid of spicy foods and drinks, this is definitely something you ought to try! Enough about the margarita! Now moving on to the food... I ordered a pretty standard dish; the chicken fajitas. This is usually my first choice in Mexican restaurants, because it's a safe choice, and usually sets the expectation for how good the other items on their menu might be; it's a good benchmark for me. Given that the fajitas were quite good, I'm definitely going back to try some of the more interesting items on their menu like the chimichangas and bbq shrimp tacos! Mmmm... I'm already looking forward to another glass (or two) of the Firecracker Margarita! =)
