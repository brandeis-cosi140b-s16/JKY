Pleasantly surprised.  My first time here as I'm never on this side of town, but came here based icon a recommendation.  

Place isn't much to look it bi only ordered the taco combination plate, but what I lived about it.  Is this is simple Mexican food done right.  Not greasy.  Not covered is stupid enchilada sauce or some other over salty mess.   Rice and beans were prefect.  Great flavor and not over salted.   I had hard shell beef tacos and the shells were homemade not some Ortega store brought crap.   

Wish this was over in Chandler as I would love to try something else on the menu.  

For anyone who is going through reviews and isn't sure. This place is worth a quick stop.
