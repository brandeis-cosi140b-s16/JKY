Stopped in for the first time from a friends'  recommendation. We tried a little bit of everything since we live no where near here. Not sure what this place used to be. Very nice, clean atmosphere. You seat yourself. They have a self service soda station and salsa bar. 
Some of the things we ordered were the Carne asada Vampiro and tacos. I was not a fan of the Carne asada. That is my only complaint with this place. The meat had a very smokey flavor to it. I know some people enjoy that, I'm not one of them. Especially with Mexican food. Smoked meat flavors are for BBQ. 
My favorite was the Al Pastor! OMG that's a MUST! I've gotta say probably the best Al Pastor I've ever had. I wish I would have gotten that in my Vampiro instead of the Carne asada. They have all of the regular Mexican dishes. Nachos, burritos, tacos, etc. I've never seen the Vampiro before. It was two mini tortillas with cheese,your choice of meat and cilantro. Think of a mini tostada sandwich. I uploaded a pic too.
Ordered a chicken quesadilla. Nothing special. They put guacamole, sour cream and cilantro in it with the chicken & cheese. 
The CORN. Oh my yum, the CORN! 
On a stick, mayo, Parmesan and paprika. Don't knock it till you try it if you've never had it. 
Chips and guacamole were ok. I like fresh guacamole. Theirs is pre-made and portioned in the fridge, ready to go. 
I liked all of the different salsas they have.had to get an order of chips to try them all.
 They also have pinto and black beans at the salsa bar.
