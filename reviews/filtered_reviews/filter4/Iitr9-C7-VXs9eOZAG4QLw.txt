I come here with the wife often and never leave disappointed.  I always seem to enjoy the fish tacos the best.  They are lighter and you don't leave stuffed because their portions are very big.  One word to the wise is not to order the margarita by the pitcher.  My wife and I did and it doesn't taste better as the drink goes on.  Too watered down and not a good taste.  We also sat inside for the first time and enjoyed it a lot.  Great Mexican place north of the 101!!
