I figure I need to finally post a real review for I have been eating here for at least 5-6 years now although i havent been checking in on yelp. This place would be comparable to a Lindo Michocan meal without the expensive price tag. When me and my wife we always seem to order the same thing. 

Salmon Salad 4.5/5- My wife always orders this and she says its one of her favorite salads to eat period. Also she loves their dressings here and she seems to alwasy finish her plate. I like that they cook salmon perfectly because most salmon salads cook the salmon where its too dry.

Chompoton 4.5/5- it is definitely my go to dish its rib Eye steak and with shrimp fajitas also with refried beans rice and salad and big portion of guacamole & go with corn tortillas. I crave eating this.  Its your mexican surf and turf and for a very reasonable price. I love how i can have a bite of steak then shrimp with some grilled onions and peppers with guacamole and smooth out my meal with some beans and rice.  

Appetizers we usually go with.

Empanadas 3.5/5- ooey go cheese filled with ground beef that also comes with guacamole,pico de gallo, and a southwest sauce which is pretty good.

You dont have to order an appetizer if youre on a budget  for you get chips and salsa but you can always add a side of refried beans for dipping and its good as well.

This place is always been a solid choice and because everything is very simple and service is always good. The place always is clean and you can bet that youll get a solid meal without the expensive price.
