They have recently re-printed the menu, as the pricing is a little higher.  But the quality of the food is great, their service is fast, even in "rush hour" they still get the food out of the kitchen and on to the table.  I like the 'Sonoran' with it's cheese sauce and the 'Papas con Chile'...   This is Mexican food at it's finest for a chain restaurant.  On the Border needs to learn a few tricks from these guys.
