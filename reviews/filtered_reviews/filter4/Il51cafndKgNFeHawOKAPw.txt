Part of the reason I was going to Vegas was to go on Foursquare badge hunts. These hunts proved to be more difficult than what I wanted and Steven grew more annoyed with me as I did my badge chasing. I found out about Pink Taco off of the Foursquare website as a valid check in to getting the Hard Rock Hotel badge. Not only were we staying right across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel but the idea that they might be serving pink tacos peaked my interest.
One thing I simply love about Las Vegas is that it truly is a city that never sleeps and stores and restaurants are open to the farthest reaches of the night. Pink Taco is no exception. The night we went it was just about to get busy and lengthy waits for a table were about to ensue. We squeezed in just the nick of time. 
Once we got seated we had some pretty delicious chips and salsa to eat. At times it seemed like the waiter was spread too thin and there were about two times when we were wondering if we would ever see him again. He forgot our silverware as well but once we were able to get him he seemed eager to please and cheery about his work.
I mentioned that the chips were good and indeed they were! I of course had to order the pink tacos. The tacos were chicken tacos that had a purposeful pink hue to them. They were tasty but not by any means really authentic. Not bad eats though.
Out of the casino restaurants that we hit on this trip I would have to say that Pink Taco was the best one I went to on this trip!
