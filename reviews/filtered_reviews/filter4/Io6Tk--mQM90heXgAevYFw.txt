I just saw this groupon and thought I would be adventurous and try out this place. My experience with AZMEX has been a very unpleasant experience so I am reluctant to try new mexican food places because of this. This place was a pleasant surprise. The food and ingredients seem to be freshly prepared and have robust flavor. The place is a little bit pricey for the items they offer but then again if you want fresh tasting that is understandable. My only complaints is for the silly thing I see a lot of AZ restaurants doing and that is charging for refills. Why nickle and dime. I'm not going to pay 20% of the full price of the drink cause I am thirsty from sitting outside in the heat. Just make sure that when you go that you plan to go when it is cooler cause there is only outdoor seating and drive thru. I felt like I was eating at a Mexican taco shop eating outside. Overall I recommend to try this place as I think it is far better than the lard laden restaurants like Carolina's that so many people love. No comparison. Do yourself a favor and try this place.
