I have spent time opening facilities in Mexico (DF, Queretaro and Tizayuca) and although I wouldn't rate La Unica on that scale I would say that this is some of the best Mexican food my wife and I have been able to find in the Indian Trail area, it's always fresh, and the service is great.  We order a lot of take out and its always correct which we appreciate so as to not have to come back.  We really enjoy La Unica and glad you are in our neighborhood!
