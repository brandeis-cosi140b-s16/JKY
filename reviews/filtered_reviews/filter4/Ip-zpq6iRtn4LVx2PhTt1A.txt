Holy-Mole did they do a turn-around in the 3 months since I last ate there!  My boss decided to have a group lunch, and thinking that suffering through another boring meal was worth it (a salary-continuation project), I went along.

Placed the order and by the time I got my drink and sat down it was coming out of the kitchen.  The food quality (and quantity) did a 180 since my last visit.  Wondering what happened I flagged down the gal the next time she was motoring by to ask.  Apparently they changed out the kitchen staff, and I think a manager or two were shown the door.  Don't know and really don't care as the food is definitely worth repeat trips.
