I have only been to the Scottsdale location so when a girlfriend suggested the Desert Ridge location for our Girls Night I said why not?! On Saturday morning I spoke to an acquaintance on Facebook about getting a cabana & got it all set up. Fast forward to later that night around 11pm when me & a couple of my girlfriends finally show up. There's a line of course, (Cinco de Mayo weekend & some band was playing) but I let them know I had a cabana reserved under my name so we got to bypass the line & didn't have to pay cover either. We get to the cabana & there are about 12 girls already there. I didn't know about half of them but whatev! Our server (never got her name) was sweet but very shy/quiet & sometimes reallllllly slow about getting us our drink orders & when we wanted to cash out. It was so packed that night & there were so many douche bags running around, that I was pretty much confined to our cabana. Thankfully my girls can keep me entertained because I had a great time! I ordered vodka cranberries all night which seemed weak at first, until I started ordering doubles. Needless to say I got pretty drunk after my 4th drink. Since we booked a cabana our group had to spend a combined total of $450, my bill came out to $63 & I left her $85. I just hope the other bitches in my group tipped her well also! Btw, I put my debit card down to start my tab but when I closed out I paid with cash. I checked my bank account online today & it showed a charge for Sandbar pending. I called them to see why it was still there & they said it should be gone within the next 3 days. Kind of annoying but understandable & just an FYI to anyone else who puts a card down but pays in cash. Any way, a lot of my friends like it here so I'm sure I'll be back eventually!
