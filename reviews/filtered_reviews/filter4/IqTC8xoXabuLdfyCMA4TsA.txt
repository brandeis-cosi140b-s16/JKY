If I am totally craving tacos... and don't mind getting into some 'Las Vegas Blvd.' traffic... COME HERE! Normally, my husband and I come here on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. It is still a packed crowd, but not as bad as the Friday/ Saturday night crowd. Out of the handful of times I have came, I have only came on a Friday night ONCE! That might be the last time we do that. 

Don't be fooled by the small appearance of these tacos... they can really fill you up. Order what you can honestly handle. Then if you are still hungry, it will be a matter of "how hungry?" and "how long am I willing to wait?" 

My go-to items are the pork "adobada" tacos, Steak 'Carne Asada' tacos, and pork sopes. I have tried the carne asada fries, but it is quite overwhelming (and that was just the 'half order'). If you do order the fries... it should be a) the only thing you eat... or b) you are going on a Man vs Food challenge. 

Tacos are $2/ each. Specialty items (i.e. Sopes) are $4. 

Seating can be a challenge here (esp. if you come during the Friday/ Saturday night crowd). We ended up eating at the car that night.
