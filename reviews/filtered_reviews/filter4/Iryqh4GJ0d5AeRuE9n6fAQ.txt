The Original Burrito Co. is quickly becoming my favorite burrito place. The owner came to eat at the restaurant I work at and she told me to come by and try this place out and being a huge fan of Mexican food I had to go. The burritos are really huge and really well priced. I love the California burrito with Chicken, add guacamole. The chicken is so moist and tender. I have tried the carne asada as well, but when I got it it was full of cilantro and jalapenos, which were just overbearing, but I'm thinking it could have been a bad day and will have to try it again. Downside for me would be that the salsa is not spicy at all. It tastes very good, but I am a huge fan of spicy, especially on Mexican food, and its a bummer for me when a place does not offer a very spicy salsa.
