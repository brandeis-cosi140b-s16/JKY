While visiting Phoenix from the Bay Area, my co-worker based out there took a couple of us on this 15 minute drive and ended up at this small strip mall.  He kept on telling us that you'll love this place!  We finally got to the restaurant, Chino Bandido?!?  WTF!  Once inside they take the new visitors off to the side to try 8 of their most popular items.  The place is Chinese meets Mexican with a Caribbean flair to it.  It is confusing when it comes to ordering, but the staff is willing to help with any questions.  Basically, you can take any item and throw it on the side, in a burrito, or in a quesadilla.  The prices are reasonable for the amount of food that you get.  I recommend the Carnitas and the Jerk Chicken.  It was weird that you can see chopsticks next to salsa at the condiment area.
