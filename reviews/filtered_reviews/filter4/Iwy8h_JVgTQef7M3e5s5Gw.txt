I had heard a lot about Maize before I tried it myself. Everyone who I talked to seemed to have enjoy their meal there, so I was rather excited when I pulled up together with a friend yesterday evening. My first thought was "Wow, they weren't kidding when they said that it's small." It seems like a perfect place to get food to-go and seating is very limited.

I ordered a burrito with pastor and my friend ordered torte with pastor. The food was really well priced and arrived at the speed of light! We had a seat at the counter and ate our meals there. The staff quickly served up our Jarritos (before we sat down even) and chips together with a delicious spicy habanero (I think) sauce. We were both satisfied with the burrito and the torte and enjoyed our dinner at Maize. 

Highly recommended if you're looking for a quick, delicious, affordable meal!
