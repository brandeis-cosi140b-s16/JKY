I'm also pretty confused at the low ratings that I see here.

Tonight was my first time and I had an enchilada with beans and rice. I cleaned my plate and I REALLY didn't need to eat that much. It was just too good to stop. I also had my fair share of chips and salsa, which were pretty tasty.

My friend had a Carne Asada Burro and she was also very happy with it.

Let's not be confused. It's not a swanky restaurant, but I didn't feel as though it was noticeably dirty, either.

The service was super quick. We never had a time when we were out of anything, and it was pretty busy.

If I have the chance I'll go back again, no question.
