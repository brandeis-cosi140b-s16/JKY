Pepe's has great Mexican food and a pretty extensive menu, but I always seem to order the same items: a chile relleno burrito, a chorizo and egg burrito, or birria (goat) or carne asda tacos. Today I came for breakfast, so it was one chorizo and egg burrito and two carne asda tacos, which I took home to split with my husband.

As usual, the food was delish, but the only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the burrito was so dang greasy. Yeah, I know chorizo is greasy, but this was WAY too greasy ... like the tortilla was completely soaked through.

I do love their chile relleno burrito, which is one of the best burritos I've ever had. And their goat tacos are fantastic. So maybe next time I'll skip the chorizo and stick with the chile relleno. You can't go wrong with any of their tacos, which are served street-style in small corn tortillas. And while I've never tried them, the carne asada fries seem to be popular. 

Just lighten up on the grease, please...
