Always a favorite.  Late lunch on a Sunday.  Sat in the bar since it was an in between time and had great service and quick lunch. Tostada for me, carnitas burro for him. And of course a  small pitcher of margarita's, frozen since it's such a hot day.  I always appreciate a lunch menu for small portions than dinner.
