While playing tour guide downtown, my friend gets a craving for mexican food. As the expert tour guide that I am, I quick pull a 180 and see out of the corner of my eye this little joint called, "La Comida". Surely, the best restaurants are the ones that look a little sketch on the outside. She becomes a little concerned but agrees none the less. We turned the corner down the long walkway to the entrance and it becomes cuter and cuter. As we enter, the inside has an authentic type feel and is surprisingly really awesome! The decor has a theme and the place is pretty hopping.

So we order drinks, the house margarita and a prickly pear margarita (when in the southwest, do as the tourists do). They come out in mason jars and that adds to the ambiance. The staff was super friendly and got really excited when our guy friend followed the sign above the bar that read "For a good time call Kat (insert restaurant phone number)". The man who waited on our table was really fun and kept calling us "family."

We ordered the Red Snapper Tacos and the guy friend got the red snapper entree. Both were good. They tasted fresh and the flavors blended well, but the tortillas felt a bit slimy. However, the best part of the culinary experience was the salsa--hands down! The salsa was a blend of spicy and smooth, and was probably one of the best salsas I have had in a really long time! 

Mid-way through our meal, the guy friend comments that this would be a great date place. He is totally right, fun ambiance, good (and slightly messy) food, and the volume is great for conversation.
