Searched Yelp for a Mexican restaurant as we were driving. TheYelpers were spot on.  

Two people for lunch and we shared the Parrillada for two, with shrimp.  Very tasty.  I had corn tortillas and the partner had wheat. Both were tasty. It is similar to fajitas but this was better.

The steak, carnitas and chicken were good.  The chicken was the best of the
three. The chorizo was outstanding.  Even included onions and potatoes.

I am from the east coast so not sure when I will get back.  But certainly will add it to my hit list. 

Lunch - no table service but they do come by often.  Dinner does have full table service.
