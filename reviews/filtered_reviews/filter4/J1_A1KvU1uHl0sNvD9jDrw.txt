I have dreams of aunt chiladas' fried dishes... Dear god - they are good. I was recently staying up the road for a business trip and visited here twice... If i had stayed longer, i would have gone again. The salsa was a bit odd with olives in it, but the flavor was good, and its had to go wrong dipping into it with fresh fried tortilla chips. I'm sure i gained an extra ten lbs each time i ate here, but i'd go again no doubt.

Service here really depends on the wait staff. The first time we went, the waitress was amazing and attentive; the second... Lets just say we waited 30 mins for her to pick up the credit card to pay.
