I'm from New Mexico, and being right next door, you think it would be easy to get some familiar grub. Not so! Unless I'm headed over to my mom's for dinner, my quest for food familiar to my taste buds has pretty much been a bust.

Although it's kind of weird to have a bunch of koi fish in a too-shallow, too-small space right when you walk in, that (and the fact that Rosita's is, indeed, in a sketchy part of town) is the only detraction.

The food isn't New Mexican, but it is yummy. I've eaten here several times. The tacos are okay. The chicken flautas come loaded with tons of sour cream and guacamole.  A friend of mine says that you can tell the quality of a place by their rice and beans, and Rosita's doesn't disappoint.

Where Rosita's shines, though, is in its soups and green chile meat dishes. Go starting in October for the best posole. Or order the green chile burrito, enchilada style. The chile isn't for wimps, and the meat is tender and melts in your mouth.
