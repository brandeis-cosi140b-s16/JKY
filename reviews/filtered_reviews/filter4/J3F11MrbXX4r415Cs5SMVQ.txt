A toss up between here and El Bravo, both about the same distance from Point A. (my house).  Delosantos wins because of the real margarita's.  My favorite entree item is the red beef burro, some of the best in town.  Excellent tequila selection.  What most Americans would consider "authentic" Mexican (Sonoran) food.  It is kinda ratty, and any restaurant that has been around this long might have trouble keeping their health dep't rating.

Edit:  After another year (and 5+ trips back), I have to give it another star, and amend my comment about the cleanliness of the restaurant.  First, the red beef chili burro is _still_ one of the best in town, I've been using that as my barometer for other Mexican restaurants, and this place still wins.  Also, they've cleaned up the dining area quite a bit, so I take back the 'ratty' comment.  Lot less dusty then I remember it, and maybe a fresh coat of paint, who knows.   Still, the prices are good, and the food is great.  What's not to love?
