All you need to know : yes, get the taco flight! If you're going with a group this is a perfect way to try a little bit of everything. The fish tacos and the veggie tacos were the standout for me. The fish were perfectly crispy without being overly greasy. I didn't expect to like the veggie tacos over the others but the sauce they used and the saut√©ed veggies were just so full of flavor. The margaritas were strong; however, there was way too much ice in them which watered it down pretty quickly. The only thing I wasn't too impressed with was the guacamole- not enough of a "kick" for me...but the salsas were great! The atmosphere was hip, service was great, food  was delicious - if I lived in AZ, this would definitely be a regular spot for me.
