My best meal in Las Vegas!

Service, food and drinks were all top notch.  

I sat at the bar and had a nice view of a TV to watch a Dodgers game and it was a perfect place for people watching too.

Service was so fast...I ordered my drink (Cadillac Gonzalez Margarita) and I had only had one sip when my chimichanga arrived.  The drink was very good, if a bit strong.  The food was hot and delicious.

I'd definitely recommend this place.
