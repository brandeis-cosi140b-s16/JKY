This building is known for its poor luck with businesses staying open, but it's looking like Paz will stand a chance.

I was lured over by the $3 margarita and looking to wind down after seeing a movie at Film Bar. The margarita was excellent! Definitely worth the $3 and then some. My husband and I split the nachos and were unable to make much of a dent in them though not for lack of trying. I recommend sharing among 3 or 4 people. The place was PACKED so service was on the slower side. Still, our wonderful waiter was sure to stop by and update us on wait times for our food and drinks.

On the night we went there was a great DJ and a small dance floor. While we weren't able to hold much of a conversation with the noise level that high, watching the couples dance was a lot of fun.
