Excellent tacos, slightly chaotic process....

The tacos al pastor are crazy delicious. The abadoba fries cannot be beat (I did not eat any, but the person I bought them for ate literally non stop and with a vengeance). 

Some people don't like the $2.00 per taco price, but most places are around $1.79 - $1.89 and don't come close. So  less than a quarter more per taco for 10 X's the flavor is still a good deal to me. 

The only drawback is the process. You get to the window, belt out your order, hang back and wait. You need to keep an eagle eye on your food otherwise it might unintentionally walk off. After that you wander over to the cashier and pay. Don't get me wrong, it works, just a bit unorganized is all. 

With that said, the staff is great and the place is very clean. 

Also, I would (as mentioned in my other reviews) hit the tip jar when you place your order. It not only helps the staff out but almost always insures an exceptional meal.
