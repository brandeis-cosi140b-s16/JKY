Loved the tacos here! Husband & I have been wanting to try this place for a while. Went out for dinner with our friends & we will all be coming back soon. Margaritas we're delicious! Salsa that comes out with the chips is pretty spicy. My husband was impressed by the selection of craft beers available since he was expecting domestic drafts & corona. My only minor issue was sitting out on the patio and not being able to read the menu because the lighting isn't that great. I would love to see some cute and festive patio lights strung across the patio!
