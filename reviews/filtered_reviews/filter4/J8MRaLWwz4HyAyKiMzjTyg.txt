It's not bad. The highlight of Huaraches Moreleon (and what keeps us coming back more than anything else) is definitely their homemade chips and the three sauces they bring out with them. Molto bene! I mean, muy bueno! Whatever. They're pretty good.

The best entree they make is the Aver Si Puede ("See if You Can"), which is basically a gigantic plate of meat with some rice and beans thrown in the middle in case you were in need of inferior sources of protein to feel like you're eating Mexican food. It feeds two large people or a small family of small people. 

Their basic enchilada sauce is not much more than watered-down tomato sauce. The mole sauce is ok. The chipotle sauce on the Enchiladas Suizas is probably the best I've had thus far. Still, even the worst enchiladas are pretty decent.

I like the breakfast skillets. 

Don't order soup.

I have not had good experiences with their more "exotic" offerings such as tripas or lengua tacos. Either the chef does not know how to make them, or the ingredients are poor. Superior tripas tacos can be found on literally any taco truck operating in the area between Santa Monica and Houston, TX. Go to Huaraches, but avoid these menu items.

Oh, the prices are reasonable, and the service is typically fast unless you order the more "exotic" offerings I mentioned.

The food is great for the area, but it still doesn't hold a candle to most Mexican food in the Southwest. For that I have to give it four out of five stars. But you should still go. This is a small, fledgling place, and it deserves your custom.
