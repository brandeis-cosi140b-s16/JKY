This place was great! The service was good (we did hear another server complaining about her table right next to us, but whatever). The menu was unique and offered several options! The only thing was... it was a bit pricey... we did over hear other patrons complaining about the price of their drinks and take it out on the server by NOT tipping, well leaving her .75 on a 26 dollar tab. Classy. I would definetley return.
