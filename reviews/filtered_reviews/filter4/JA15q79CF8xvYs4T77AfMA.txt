Maybe it was my NY accent that caused them to tone down my food but it wasn't spicy. Thinking maybe me being a Northerner couldnt take their heat.  I went with my friend who swore up and down how spicy their food was. Maybe next time Ill let him order. That is only reason they lost a star. Green chile salsa is out of this world and has a great heat to it. I just wish the chile plate did the same. Carnitas platter was out of this world amazing. Pork cooked just right and super tender. Would definitely try again and hopefully they will bring on the heat!
