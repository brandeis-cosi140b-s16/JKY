When on vacation or close to home we all have our "go to" bars and restaurants we favor most of all to sit and enjoy some time. I found this place for my stay in Las Vegas, on the strip at Cabo Wabo Cantina. Upon arrival, what better way to gear up for a week in sunny Las Vegas that enjoying some great music, in perfect view of the southern portion of the strip, with a Margarita on the rocks with a salted rim. The outside music is played through some really nice sounding, full range sounding speakers and the genre is mainly that of classic rock. 
Two Margaritas with a caddie and I was off, knowing I would soon return.
Unlike more hostesses at many dining establishments on the strip, I had come to the unfortunate realization that most are disinterested or too busy gabbing with a coworker. Addressing the party properly and getting them seated promptly in the dining area seems to play second fiddle, these girls did just that.

The three juice Mojito which is not on the menu, but a quickly thought concoction of pineapple, strawberry and something, the juice was a puree I thought to try something different.

Straight forward menu of traditional Mexican dishes, nothing too dangerous or risky. The Carnitas platter once served looked like a skimpy little nothing plate for one, once we began to dig in the pork showed its density. Seven hand rolled flour tacos later and two people were nicely filled,  if you add in the chips. No up charge for a few additional tortillas. The Macho Salsa will really clear your sinuses as it was the hottest item I had all week and I order everything hot. 

Great service by our server Ron, who kept the drinks coming and did whatever it took to make our wisit to Cabo Wabo an above average dinner experience, he deserves special mention.
