Probably have been here around 15 times over the last 2 years and only have been slightly disappointed in my food maybe twice. The margaritas are great and the food almost always is great, I usually go for the shrimp or beef burrito and am always happy with them. My biggest complaint with the place is that is in a sorta ghetto area but otherwise if you want authentic Mexican food come here!
