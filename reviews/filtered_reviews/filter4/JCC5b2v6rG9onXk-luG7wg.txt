Came here with some friends for dinner, and were thoroughly impressed.  Would've given it 5 stars.... not sure why I'm not...?

Started with Blood Orange margaritas.... my friend ordered mine frozen, prefer the rocks much more.  More flavor, less brain freeze...

Could drown in a bowl of the table-side Guac.  As others have stated before, perfect combination, spicy without compromising flavor.

Had the lamb appetizer, tender, juicy, and delicious, and after devouring a ton of chips was enough to fill me up, but my hubby had the diver scallops, and was still hungry... tastes great, less filling.

Our friends RAVED about the chicken dinner, personally I can't order chicken when I go out to eat.  No matter how good it may be, I feel like I should eat something more exotic.

Ambiance is everything.  Uber cool spanish decor with a splash of classy flair. Dark, loud, and super sexy.  Fun for dinner with friends, or a hot date.
