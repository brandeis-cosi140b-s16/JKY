4 1/2 STARS

What can I say? This is an amazing place. It's a 100% large Mexican supermarket. It has a huge variety of all products including fresh fish, meat & produce.

You can also eat there, which we happily did. At the deli, we had a ceviche tostada and a fish taco for $4. The ceviche was delicious, although the fish in the taco wasn't cooked through.

Then we walked by the bigger, better food counter & couldn't resist the tacos there, which were fabulous.

Only demerits here are for sloppy, haphazard service & the undercooked fish taco.

A great place...
