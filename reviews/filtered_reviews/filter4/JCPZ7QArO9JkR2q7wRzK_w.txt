I came here for dinner with my family after using the map feature from yelp. The place is super cool and the ambiance is great. Upon entry we were met by friendly staff members and promptly seated and served drinks. 

The food was great!!!!  I got the steak burrito and my wife ordered chicken al fuego. I couldn't be happier with the meal. There might have been a mix up in the kitchen which delayed it, but it was corrected with a second round of drinks on the house. 

There was live entertainment that sadly started towards the end of our meal. He was great and it really set the mood. We will go back here for sure and I hope this place gets support to stick around.
