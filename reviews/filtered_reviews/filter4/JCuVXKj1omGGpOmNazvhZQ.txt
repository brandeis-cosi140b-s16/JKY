Ok...so this is not a fancy mexican restaurant, but I love the atmosphere!  I always feel like I could be in mexico, and I mean on a vacation enjoying myself.   I love the outdoor seating .  I am vegetarian and the staff was great in helping me select a good item.   The happy hour price on rita's was fantastic.   Fun Times!  Will for sure come back
