I had a good meal at Nacho Daddy's. When I sat down with the group I was greeted with a glass of Ice cod water garnished with a lemon, and I soon ordered a Dos Equis Lager, both did not last longWhen it came to to order I took the Taco Tuesday Special the Carne Asada Taco's. When they arrived they were goodwith the Carne Asada and the onions. In all it was a very good meal.
