Have a craving for Mexican (or just margaritas)? This is your place!  
They have a huge menu, so it can be overwhelming if it's your first time at the restaurant. I stick to a couple things that are my fav: carne asada, enchiladas, fajitas. And definitely order the guacamole, they make it right at the table the way you like it, delish!
This restaurant has a great view of the strip and they have a band playing traditional music. With that, it is very loud and very hard to talk. I don't recommend this place for large groups for that reason. 

Helpful Tip: Take it easy on the chips. The waiters are on top of their shit so if you're getting low on chips, they will immediately spot it and refill your bowl... causing you to eat WAY too many chips and be completely full by the time your meal shows up. This situation never ends well since you feel obligated to eat a little of your meal even though there is absolutely no room for it.
