Came for lunch today, great service and food was very good. Al pastor and Barbacoa tacos are excellent. Snapper taco is average. Guacamole is good but too sweet for my taste as the put mandarin oranges in it, not really to my palate.
Margarita- just ok nothing special. Didn't taste like it was just fresh squeezed lime and a bit watered down.
Overall a good experience and will be back.
