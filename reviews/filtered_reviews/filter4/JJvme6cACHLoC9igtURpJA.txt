The staff are extremely helpful (at least one seemed to still be learning the menu), knowledgeable, friendly, and maybe even excited about their new biz!  LOVE that!

The menu is extremely shrimp heavy, which isn't great since I'm allergic. I did learn that they COMPLETELY separately cook the shrimp from the fish (including labels on everything - so I knew they weren't just saying that and it probably would be safe for me to eat).  I wasn't too hungry though, so I just got the simple cheese quesadilla for $2.99.  It's pretty paltry to look at, but once you add your choice of toppings from the condiment bar, it's worth more than that, for sure.  

The had an onion mix, cole slaw, fresh cabbage, pico, several salsas, several sauces, and a great selection of hot sauces to choose from.

Drinks include free refills (but drink station is in the kitchen so it's not self serve--not my favorite).  I hope this place succeeds. It's in a strip mall by Walmart (gag), and next to Subway and Panda Express (gag).
