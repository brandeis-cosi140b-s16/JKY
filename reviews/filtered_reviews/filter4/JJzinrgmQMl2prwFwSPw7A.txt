I think this place is great! I love that it's been there for years and years, locally owned with friendly staff. They're super easy-going and makes for a great lunch spot. Great spot for toddlers too :)

I like the Navajo taco--yum! Really, I think I'd like anything here. Oh, and they have wine magaritas----never head of before. The alcohol is not tequila, but, can you guess? Wine! It's definitely different but I likey. Would have had another but I was driving. boo.
