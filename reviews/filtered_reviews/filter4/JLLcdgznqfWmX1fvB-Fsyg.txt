I thoroughly enjoyed my first visit to Frank and Lupe's! They have an awesome menu, extremely reasonable on their prices, and delicious margaritas. The service was pretty good and the food came out quickly. I would love to come back when it's a bit warmer to enjoy their outdoor patio. Thanks for a great experience! We'll be back for sure!
