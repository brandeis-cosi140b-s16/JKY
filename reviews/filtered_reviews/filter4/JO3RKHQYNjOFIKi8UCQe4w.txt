started off shaky as no one greeted us for about 10 minutes after we got to our table.  One of the waiters literally walked by us 3 times and didn't say one word.  Right when my boyfriend got up to rip someone a new one this nice gentleman who was working and managing the bar came over and served us.  He was so apologetic and totally turned our experience around.  We had the the tortilla soup that was pretty good and the esquites (mexican corn) was AMAZING, i also had the steak and my boyfriend had the enchiladas and salad which he raved about.  The ambiance is very beautiful and there was a DJ (FIrst Friday) spinning amazing old school funk.  Very fun and hip place, I will be back.
