We found this place completely by accident, but it called to me from the road. 

When you arrive they provide you 3 sauces a hot chipotle, a medium green chile and a mild pico de gallo. I mixed the chipotle & the pico... to die for. My friend, who normally perfers a milder pallet enjoyed it too. She raved about the guacamole, said it was even better than hers. And she's the expert. 

Be sure to start with one of their traditionally Hispanic juices. We had both a glass of the Watermelon & the Cantalope. We were wondering if they would mix juices; our waiter overheard & yes they can. 

My friend started with Cream of Cilantro soup, which turned out to be delicious and the serving size was substantial. Then she had a salad with chicken. On her first bite she paused and savored. We both did a lot of that.

I order a beef dish that was new to me. It was thinly sliced, yet still succulent and such a flavor! The plate also contained refried bean, rice and some killer chilequiles. 


A couple of notes
- I asked the waiter what region the food was from because the beef reminded me of the food of Jalisco & while the chilequiles seemed pure Sonoran. He said it was from a region south of La Ciuidad de Mexico. 
- the restaurant currently has to no liquor license, but you can bring in beer and wine. The new owners are in the process of applying for one. 
- the name "Asi Es La Vida" if translated word for word would be "This is the Life" however in colloquial Spanish it mean "Such is life" or "That's how the world is" LOL

Unfortunately I live in Gilbert, but I'll be back.
