Nandos! A name worth shouting... And Shout I will!

I remember finding this place by coincidence about 3 years ago and after having an amazing lunch I forgot where it was! So, I was getting my car cleaned oat the car wash on Val Vista and Baseline and as I drove around the back I saw the sign... NANDO'S...  and it all came back... I Found IT!!!!

Honestly, I couldn't wait to tell the wife so I picked up the phone and said "Honey, get in the car and meet me for lunch" and she did just that.

We split the Fajitas. They are amazing. The meat *chicken and beef) were so tender (I hate tough) and the flavors and freshness of the food filled this ol' mans belly to the brim. I was in fatso heaven!

Heres the bottom line, I have tried numbers items now after my rediscovery and can tell you that the food is great and the portions are gargantuan. If you fill up pretty fast, split a plate. If you eat a big meal, order separately.

The only thing I was not a fan of was the Guacamole and the Chili Relleno. The Guacamole, well... Its the old whipped Guac' recipe But.... it's edible. The Relleno is too full of cheese. Would you like some Chili Relleno with your mound of hot gooey cheese? No Thank You...

Other than those two items, I think you will be really happy with the rest of the menu. Chicken appears to be all white meat too. I'm always a fan of white chicken meat.

Bon' Appetite! Did I just use French in a Mexican restaurant review? Ay Carumba!
