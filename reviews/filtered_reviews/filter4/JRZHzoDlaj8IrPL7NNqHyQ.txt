Great food with a big menu.  I had the combo plate (enchilada, taco, and relleno) the first visit and the quesadillas the second.  The combo was great and a big portion.  The margarita was pretty good but $18 for a 12oz is pretty ridiculous even for Vegas.  Definitely will return and would recommend.
