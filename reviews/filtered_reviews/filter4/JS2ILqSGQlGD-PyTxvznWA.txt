I found this place a few months ago and kick myself for not finding it sooner. I live very close. I had a Carnita burrito and it was sooooo good!! The best I have had so far. I ordered rice and beans also and they wrapped up my burrito in tinfoil so that everything didn't get slopped together when i took it home. Their Margarita's are awesome!!! They are pricy after happy hour is over. I don't care for their guacamole, it really doesn't have any flavor.
