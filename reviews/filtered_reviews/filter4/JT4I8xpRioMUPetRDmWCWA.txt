Went there tonight with my whole family to celebrate my little sisters birthday!

Food was really good! I like more of the more messy mexican style food, but it was still great! Our waiter was fantastic, always topping off drinks, and it seemed like he was just happy to serve us. We had brought a cake for my sister, but he also brought out a delicious free dessert. 

It's a beautiful restaurant. Colorful, festive, lots of cool art. The outside seating area is amazing. Flowers and plants everywhere, and a pretty fountain. There's a garden as you walk up to the door and the fresh flower aroma is so relaxing. 

Was pretty slow, but it was late on a Wednesday night; would be a great time to stop in to avoid a rush. Heard its crazy busy on weekends. 

I don't live on this side of town, but if I happen to be over here, I would definitely stop in again!
