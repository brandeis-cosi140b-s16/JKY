Made the trek to this unassuming place after watching Man vs. Food showcasing the restaraunt. Hubby and I couldn't resist the temptation of the humongous tortas on the tv. After a studying the menu for quite some time, I ordered the Arizona torta along with a Pina Colada drink. Figured this should fill me somewhat.  The Olympics were on tv, which garnered most of my attention, until the food arrived. It probably took ten minutes or so for the waitress to return to our table with our glorious, fancy, fruit decorated drinks and a moundful of torta goodness. One bite of the sandwich= instant fan. The sandwiches are really large, so even half was enough. I will definitely be back. Next time, I will try the chilaquiles with eggs and steak...mmmm
