We were actually heading next door for dinner, when I saw this restaurant.  It looked like a cute place (people sitting on the patio and flat screens all over), and I was craving some chips and salsa so we decided to check it out.  They brought us a basket of chips with a small bowl of their fresh salsa.  I ordered the triple salsa so I could try three more (pico, habanero, and tomatillo) for $5.  The pico was okay, tomatillo was a little sweet, but the habanero was AMAZING (super spicy with a great flavor!).  I had the skinny margarita (really good), ordered the nachos for dinner, and my boyfriend ordered quesadillas.  My nachos were amazing!  Although every chip was covered with toppings, they did not get soggy throughout dinner.  The chips served with the salsa were fresh and crispy, and I used them to eat some of the additional toppings that were falling off the nachos.  My boyfriend also ate the nachos with me (we didn't even finish them!) and only ate 1 piece of his quesadilla (there were 4).  He said the quesadilla was alright, but we both agreed the nachos were awesome!  The best thing about this restaurant was the service, though.  Our waiter was very friendly and ensured we always had what we needed.  Overall, this is a great spot and I'm glad we ended up stumbling into it on a Sunday night for dinner :)
