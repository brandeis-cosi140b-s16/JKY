Let's test the authenticity... So the restaurant and bar area were packed.  They offer seating in either the dinning room or the patio, and it took about 45 minutes to get seated.  The Margaritas were great... the food was respectable, not authentic.

The nachos" tortillas cut in half, cheese melted to the tortilla (think cheese crisp) and a hunk of shredded meat neatly placed on each "Nacho".  Don't get me wrong, they tasted great, and they come with pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream and shredded lettuce.  We also had steak fajitas, ordered the 2 person portion.  It was enough and then some.  They were good... not mind blowing, but very good.

All In All, it was a pleasant experience... the staff is very friendly and attentive, even on such a busy night.
