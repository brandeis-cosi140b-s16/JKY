St. Patrick's Day was the first day of business for Vegas' 2nd Wahoo's.  This chain that originated in Orange County, CA, is familiar to all the SoCal transplants like me, but I've never had Wahoo's until tonight.  If you think all they have is fish, you'd be wrong (like me!).  The choice of fillings in addition to fish are chicken, carnitas, carne asada, shrimp, tofu, mushrooms (in a Polynesian marinade and sauteed), vegetarian, and Banzai veggies (a veggie mix sauteed in teriyaki sauce).  I'm happy to say that the food is fresh, abundant, and I'm glad that a location opened up in my 'hood.  I had the shrimp taco combination: 2 overflowing tacos, brown rice, and black beans.  I couldn't say no to the Maui Onion Rings so I had those, too, but maybe not the best combination with tacos.  Regardless, I am full!  The place is brand new, the service is great, and the ambiance is laid-back, just as if the beach were right outside the door.
