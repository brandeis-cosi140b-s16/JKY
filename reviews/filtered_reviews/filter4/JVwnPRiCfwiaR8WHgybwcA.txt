The food is great. I love the authenticity.  I would give them 5 stars but they need to work on customer service.  I called to place an order for 7 breakfast burrito for myself and colleagues that we do every Friday for breakfast. I simply asked if it were possible if they could cut the burritos in half and the lady's reply was "we don't cut them in half" Oh. Well excuse me. It's so sad that there's no such thing as customer service anymore because they could have made an exception.  I thought to satisfy a customer, you try to meet their expectations and accommodate them. Whatever tho, overall the food was good, just need to work on their customer service skills.
