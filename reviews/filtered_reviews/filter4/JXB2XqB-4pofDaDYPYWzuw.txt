Very Nice! We live just down the road and followed some of the other positive Yelp reviews and had a great meal. We ate in the restaurant but could hear some live entertainment in the lounge area.  That was on a Sunday. The specials change on Saturday and go through the week. 

I had the special and it was great was about just under $10 bucks plus drink.   Marisa was our server and she was very helpful explaining any questions we had about the menu.  My spouse had the carne Asada and was very pleased. 

I would recommend for someone looking for casual and off the Las Vegas Strip!
