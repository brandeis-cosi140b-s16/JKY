This is a great place to have a "revolving door" because you will want to come back over, over, over.

The atmosphere itself is something to visit. Very unique from the corner of the room to the outdoor seating area... its candy for the eyes!

Very unquie and familiar menu items. I was most interested in the mashed-like potatoe side with entree meals. I had not had that experience at previous Mexican eaterys state side or in Mexico. Very good.  I also love love love the squash soup. Very flavourful and smells wonderful with clove spices =D

Overall, great atmosphere, great food and unique dishes! The only down is service is lacking. Body language is not enough to alert staff for assistance.
