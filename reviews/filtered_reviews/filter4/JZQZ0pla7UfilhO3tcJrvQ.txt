I love this place! Chips are seasoned, portions are huge and prices are cheap! I'm in love with the nachos supreme, empanadas, burritos & chimichangas! The margaritas are good most of the time, but sometimes they skimp on alcohol. Still the best mexican place I've found near me. I drive 40 minutes to eat here!
