We have family dinner once a month and this was my pick.  The place was packed on a Friday night but we were warmly greeted and seated almost immediately, which made me happy as I have an aversion to excessive wait times and tend to get cranky.

Once seated, we set about getting caught up.  Our waiter was efficient, unobtrusive, and nonplussed by the requests for separate checks.  He had also made sure our table had a baby seat for my great-niece, in place before we even asked for it

The food and drinks were yummy.  We are natives and require Mexican and Margaritas at least monthly.  This really hit the spot.  The restaurant is cute and welcoming, not to mention a Phoenix institution.  Try it, you won't be disappointed
