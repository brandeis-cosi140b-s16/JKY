Food was very tasty. Had the Carne Asada. I really enjoyed it. My wife really liked the Sangria and they so have a margarita sampler! Yummy! 

Probably great for a date but was really dark when was there with my family. Server was a little slow but was training so not completely her fault. Nice atmosphere. Would definitely go back but maybe this time with just my wife to enjoy the dark ambience a little more.
