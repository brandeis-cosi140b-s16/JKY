The first time we came here was in August and if I would have written a review based on that visit, I would have given them 1 star for the poor service that we received.  I called and spoke with the manager after that visit and he apologized and offered to send me a gift card to have us come back and try his restaurant again.  We went again last night, different server, and the service was much better.  The salsa and bean dip they bring out with the tostada chips is heavenly.  Their guac appetizer is pretty good.

Their tacos are to die for.  Both times I've gotten the street tacos and I have not been disappointed.  There is so much flavor in their food and everything is really fresh.  Their Mexican rice is super amazing too.

I would definitely come back here again.
