Was invited to a surprise party at this location over the weekend.... didn't know what to expect, but as soon as you walked in, u felt welcome. It has a warm, friendly atmosphere.  Perfect place to hold such gatherings, as they had a few different private areas.  We also had our own buffet, which worked out great for such an event.  The workers were all attentive and the food was good! Would be back another time for some dinner and drinks! Great place for large parties too!!!
