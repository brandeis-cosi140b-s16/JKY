Although, I missed the Taco happy hour I was able to get one of the Tortas sandwiches and the chips and guacamole.  The sandwich was very good and the guacamole had a wow factor as it is not the run of the mill stuff.  The patio has been recently done/updated and being it was a nice evening outside we got to enjoy eating out.  I did not get to take in the flamenco dancing before but have done so before and found it full of fun and totally enjoyable to watch.  This place has come so far.  Reminds me a bit of Hotel Babylon, but without the pretension
