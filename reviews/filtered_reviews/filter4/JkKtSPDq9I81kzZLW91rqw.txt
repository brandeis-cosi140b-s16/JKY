This place is pretty great!

I absolutely love the view of market square that the restaurant has. For Mexican food in Pittsburgh, Las Velas does a great job. 

I always order the quesadillas and the queso  here. I love the fresh taste and great prices! I usually go here around happy hour so my meal (quesadillas are actually an appetizer) is half price! 

The service is a little slow at times but the restaurant is usually packed so I understand. Give this place a try!
