We have visited this place several times and have never been disappointed.  The service is friendly and quick and the food is generally excellent.  If you want to rock your taste buds, order the camerones diabla and tell them extra spicy, they are outstanding but you may pay later on.  The only criticism I have is that the dishes are probably $2-3 over the prices you may see in other Mexican restaurants.
