Review:  20 Veg Fried Rice / Red Braised Pork Street Sandwich

We specifically went to this restaurant to try the 20 Veg Fried Rice ($17.88) that was featured on Foodnetwork's "Best Thing I Ever Ate."  LOVED it!  I wish I could duplicate the sauce.  Big bowl, definitely feeds 2 as a main dish, 3-4 as a side.  My husband had the Red Braised Pork Street Sandwich ($8) and he said it was very good.  Pricey though for a very small sandwich.  Still, the quality is outstanding and I'd rather eat less and pay more for great food.  Bench style seating on community tables is hard on the back (no back rests); very sleek modern style - interesting ever changing graphics projected on the walls.  I'd go back for the Veg Fried Rice and would like to try their other food.  Great quality!
