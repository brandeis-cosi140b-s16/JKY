Inexpensive, tasty, and quick! What else could you ask for? Walk up to the taco counter, choose your meat, and what kind of carb you want it nestled in. Boom...donezos! Couldn't be easier! The Al Pastor (the adobada marinated meat on a swirling spit) is pretty popular and rightly so. Nothing but tasty goodness. I asked what the differences were in a few different pork preparations: pibil, buche, and carnitas and the guy gave us a sampling of each. All different cuts of meat marinated in various ways and each just as tasty as the one before it. Seriously, can't go wrong here. Thumbs up!
