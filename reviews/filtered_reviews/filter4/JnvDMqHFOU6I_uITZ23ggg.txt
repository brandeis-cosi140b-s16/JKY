Best tacos in Vegas.  I've visited this place in Mexico and San Diego (it's a small chain), and this place is just as good.  The al pastor is their best.  The buche is too wet for my liking.  Make sure they have handmade tortillas or it's not the same.  The tacos are small and expensive, as I can eat 5-6.  With drink, that'll come out to around $15.  Get a plate of free scallions and jalapenos, you just need to ask.  

Very confusing ordering process for a first timer, as there are separate lines for the al pastor and other meats.  This location is very busy which ensures a quick turnover of their food, keeping things fresh and safe.

The quality of the food qualifies for a 5 rating, but factoring in the price nets this place a 4.
