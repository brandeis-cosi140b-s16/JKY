Everyone else was feeling like a baller.  Saturday night was the night that many of my Vegas cohorts decided to go spend $100 on dinners at fancy pants restaurants that me and my broke ass last minute trip to Vegas self couldn't afford.  I wanted to eat a nice meal, but one that I could afford, so a few of us ended up at the Border Grill.  I was pleased with our choice for sure.

Dining on the patio in the heat with the misters every so often cruising our way, it was a gorgeous time of dusk to dine.

Sipping on my Cruzan Mojito and enjoying my two appetizers, tortilla soup and plantain empanadas, I was just reveling in the fact that this meal wasn't going to break my bank.  It felt upscale, but the average $25 entrees were reasonable.

Everything about the service, location, drinks, and all the entrees on the table had a hint of class to them, I was just stoked to be able to afford them....this way i could go and, instead of spending $100 on a meal, just hand the money to the blackjack dealer and say, "here, I think you need this more than me".  That experience would only take 5 minutes, as opposed to the 2 hour or so meal i could have enjoyed with it.  I mean, you see my point right?  5 minutes i can deal with...2 hours of tasty food...yah, like ill ever get that 2 hours back. 

OK...ill pull the bitter back, and just say that it was a delightful choice for a meal.  Company included.
