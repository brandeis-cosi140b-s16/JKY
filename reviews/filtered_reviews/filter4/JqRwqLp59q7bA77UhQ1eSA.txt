I wanted to find a place to catch dinner before watching Myst√®re -Cirque du Soleil. ISLA Mexican Kitchen & Tequila Bar did the trick. 
Seated promptly by the hostess was A++ Its amazing what a smile can do! =) 

They serve Chips & 3 different kinds of Salsa prior to your meal. 
The food was really tasty. Ordered the Pork Carnitas & Beef tenderloin w/ an enchilada & au gratin! Service was wonderful & fast! What a great way to start a lovely evening! I wanted to dance The CHA CHA!
