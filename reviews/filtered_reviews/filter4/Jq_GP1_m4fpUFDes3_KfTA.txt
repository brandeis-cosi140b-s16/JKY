Passed the restaurant many times before. Decided to try it as I had recently eaten at the original Dona Maria in the old part of Las Vegas. They have a special offer for $12.95,
The New place was priced higher, it see to me. Lunch for two with dessert was $41.50 with tip. I would go back as this is the best restaurant in the area. Clean, modern and excellent service.
