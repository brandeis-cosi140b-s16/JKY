I was very impressed by the service we received.  Our server was attentive and made sure our drinks were always full.  We enjoyed the Tejas Trio...the cheese dip was my personal favorite.  The green chile barbacoa enchiladas were great.  They had lots of shredded beef and a perfect amount of sauce.  Next time I have to try the mac & cheese!
