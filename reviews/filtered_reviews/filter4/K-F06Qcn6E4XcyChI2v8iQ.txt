Great food, service and atmosphere.  We regularly meet friends here, and it's always a good time.  The atmosphere gives this good-food place its fourth star - the patio, booths, tables, etc. are great for socializing.  The service is friendly and the drinks are great.

Between our friends, we've sampled lots of items on the menu and everything is pretty fresh and yummy - not mind-blowing, but solid.  Highlights include the grilled fish or roasted mushroom tacos - yum!  The cheese crisps are great, too.  I'd definitely recommend the guacamole to go with the chips and salsa - I defy you not to fill up on these.
