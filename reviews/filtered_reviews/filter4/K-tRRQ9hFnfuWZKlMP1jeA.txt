I was craving street tacos and this place is as close to the street tacos you will get in Rocky Point. It's a small quaint place but they have such a variety of different salsas I didn't even know existed. The corn tortillas were fresh and the carne asada tacos were extremely on point. 
I'll be coming back here sooner than you think just to get my taco fix!
