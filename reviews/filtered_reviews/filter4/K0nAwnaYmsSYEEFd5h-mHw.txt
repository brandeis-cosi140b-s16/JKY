WHOO HOO - another Top Chef Master restaurant to try.  I loved Susan Feniger on the show - her food looked inventive.  Stopped for a quick lunch - had the steak salad and my husband had the Plantain Empanadas and Green Corn Tamales.  The chips and salsa were a bit too good, should have not eaten so many!   The corn tamales were fresh and delicious.  

The steak Salad was delicious - I really tried to only pick out the steak because I ate too many chips.....cooked perfectly and flavorful.  The Empanadas were not only delicious but we took some back to our room and ate them later that night - Never had anything like them, they were like a dessert.    

I will have to go back (to the Santa Monica location) and try some of the Steak Tacos.  I don't typically LOVE Mexican food but I love this style of Mexican food.  It's cleaner and flavorful.  Wish I could exert better self control with the chips and salsa....
