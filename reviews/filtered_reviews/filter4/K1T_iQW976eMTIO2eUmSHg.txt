First of all, you must know that this restaurant is attached to a strip club. No, you don't have to go inside, there's a separate entrance. 

Our ca driver had never heard of the place, but that didn't stop us. The chips and salsa were awesome, the carnitas were great, the fajitas were outstanding, the service was perfect, but the margaritas were just so so. 

Make the trip, your belly will thank you.
