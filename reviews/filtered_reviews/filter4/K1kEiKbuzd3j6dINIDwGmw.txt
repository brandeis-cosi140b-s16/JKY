We visited Cantina Laredo on a Friday evening.  The six of us had a great time.  Our party consisted of 4 adults and two children.

The wait for a table was 5-7 minutes for the patio.  The host staff was very polite.  

Our server, Jose, was fantastic! He was very attentive, without being over-bearing.   

The chips were thin, crispy and just enough salt.  They were served with hot and mild salsas, the charred tomatoes and peppers made the salsa great! 

The food was really good.  We all sampled each others plates and were very pleased with all of our choices, Cheviche, Durnago plate, Camarones Escondidos, Spinach Enchiladas and of course chicken tenders for the kids.  

The patio was perfect!  It was so relaxing our 5 yr old fell asleep before we left.  

Our only regret, we were too full to try any of the desserts they had to offer.
