Unexpected local find on our way to see gold and silver "Pawn Stars" shop. Service was great, servers were friendly and knowledgeable. Mexican food was authentic and drinks were awesome. Try the strawberry margarita made with real strawberries not the flavored crap you get on the strip for $20 bucks. Prices were reasonable. Would definitely go back. It's not a "fancy" place but it's good food from friendly people at a reasonable price!
