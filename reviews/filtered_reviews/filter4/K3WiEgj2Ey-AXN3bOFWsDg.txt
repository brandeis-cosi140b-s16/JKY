Are you craving your nana's red chile with fresh tortillas but she happens to be maybe in another state!!!! Well here is some good news, out here in the valley, we have Carolinas! 

I was craving a red chile burro with some beans, I mean really craving it and I was out on the west side and knew where I had to stop!  That's right, Carolinas! Oh yea!

Ordered a red chile & beans burro & shredded beef taco, let me tell you, it was delish!!  They also offer a 3 way baby!!! Clean up your mind son, we are still talking food, it's a red chile, green chile and bean burro,,,that right there is burrito bliss I tell ya!

Was sad when the burro was gone, but my craving was satisfied, looking forward to the next time!
