The pulled pork taco is my new favorite. I also have to give props to their scallop ceviche with its big, hearty pieces of fresh scallop, grapefruit, and avocado...not what I was expecting at all (I was expecting to be sorely disappointed). I also love that the ceviche changes daily, and I can't wait to come back to try it again.

But okay, here's my gripe with Yo Rita. Ambiance-wise, it's basically a bar that serves food. But yet, they have no drink specials. Not even a happy hour! This could be such a good spot to get a couple tacos and pregame a night out on the Southside. You know, for those of us who don't want to brave the crowd of douchebags at Nakama, but also aren't in the mood to stuff our faces full of burgers and wings at Fatheads or Doublewide before we indulge in a night of binge drinking. Just do me a favor and think about it, Yo Rita. I would come so much more often and order so many more drinks. It would be a win-win situation for us both!

PS: The drinks are delicious, anyway.
