I've had this place bookmarked for almost a year before I finally decided to try it out. Glad I finally did because it is AWESOME. Its definitely a hidden gem. The starter of homemade chips and salsa is friggen delicious! I felt like I was in Mexico. Very friendly staff. The guac.....YUM. This is my new favorite!
