I have been in Las Vegas 6 yrs. I am a huge foodie. I am at 600 restaurants in Las Vegas in the 6 yrs. I've been here. This is a great place. I hear the opening was not good but let me tell you, It's amazing now. The ceviche is some of the best I've had in Vegas. The service was great. Mark, the manager is very passionate about the food. I think this is a place you don't want to miss. I had two of the Guacamoles (Tradicional and Mango) both excellent; we had the camaron and mixto ceviches, both amazing. We had the espada, carne, and pastor tacos, all great. We finished with the flan and tres leeches. This was the restaurant week special. People often ask me if I ever go back to a restaurant, this is one I will. Give it a try. This is not central Mexico food. It's more the east coast of Mexico influence. If you're looking for huge burritos, this is not it. But, if you're looking for fresh and amazing, give it a try.
