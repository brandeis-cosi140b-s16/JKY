So coming from they bay area(831) in California were Mexican food is the staple food to eat i want to find that taco place here in phoenix that reminds of the bay are or even better Mexico. I do have to say that the tacos de asada are by far the best tacos at ta' carborn. I tried al pastor they are good but no match to what i have eaten in my home town of Watsonville. The tripas or tripe was also no match. Don't get me wrong they are still good and worth the trip if you want some tacos. All in all i would go back to try more stuff on their menu. The salsa bar is amazing the only thing i would add is grilled onions to add to the tacos. Now who doesn't like grilled onions on their tacos? Anyways if your in for some tacos, you cant go wrong with ta' carbon,enjoy fellow yelpers.
