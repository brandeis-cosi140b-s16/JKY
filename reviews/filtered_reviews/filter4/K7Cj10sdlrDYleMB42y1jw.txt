Food tastes good. Standard Mexican fast food. I would recommend the combos they offer. Pretty good value and lots of food. Delicious salsa and chips. Their homemade tortillas are a highlight. I also recommend ordering to go. Not the cleanest or nicest place to dine in. As others said, not too incredible but it's consistent and tastes good.
