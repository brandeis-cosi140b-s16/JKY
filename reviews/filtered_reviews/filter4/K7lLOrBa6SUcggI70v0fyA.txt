I met a decent sized group of people at The Mission for a Sunday brunch and it was a treat.

My friend and I each had the Chicaquiles, which were prepared wonderfully and served very promptly (hot plate!). I had a mimosa while waiting and while it was very good, with fresh squeezed orange juice, the eleven dollar setback for a single drink was a bit much. While we waited, the wait staff brought out a guacamole cart and prepared a bowl of it especially for us based on what we wanted in it. The ingredients looked very fresh and the guac was delicious.

I decided on some coffee with my breakfast and I must recommend it to anyone who enjoys a brunch with some java. Apparently (as told by our waitress) the coffee is a blend prepared for The Mission exclusively. It was definitely a highlight during the meal.

Our group ordered almost one of everything from the brunch menu and I heard no complaints about quality, quantity or freshness of what we received. I'm sure I will make another visit to this lovely establishment in the coming months, when I do, I'll be sure to update my review and add any new comments.
