Went here with my sister for a couple drinks and burgers after a long day of hiking around Sedona. The food was fantastic (I had the pepperjack and jalapeno burger, my sister had the ribs) and the atmosphere in the restaurant was very laid back and casual. Our server was very attentive and friendly.
