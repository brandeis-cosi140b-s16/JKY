This place is such a find. Let's start with the chips & salsa because that's really what melts my butter. Perfection! chips were thin, crispy, hot. The salsa was the perfect consistency, not the Hot Ketchup variety & none of that we opened a jar of Pace Picante, hahaha these stupid gringos!  I mean, honestly, my Mexican food standards are not that demanding. Give me the same quality I could make at home without having to drag out my food processor & I'm your best friend. 

Rice & beans were good, typical, but good. Tortillas are exactly like my grandma's, probably full of lard (sorry if they're not but I don't see this place making the Jenny Craig hitlist anyway). And lard is necessary to build your quality cellulite. That, and butter slathered on the lard laden tortillas; now the clouds have parted. 

I ordered the chile relleno plate and the chile relleno was very satisfactory - the batter could be a tad flufflier but, hey, who's measuring. On another visit, I ordered the chicken taco. The chicken was moist & shredded, very good. are the hard shells handmade? I detected a slight comparison to Lawry's but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. I love the shredded lettuce on everything. It's very Baja & makes me feel a little better about the fact that I've completed reversed the effects of 4 hours of Insanity Workout. 

The person who complained about the service should go to Macayo's or Arriba's (excuse me as I hork all over my keyboard). Ok, better now. if you are looking more streamlined, corporate, dining process, these places will be little gems for you. (heheheee)
