Apparently I'm the Duke on @Yelp or the Mayor on @FourSquare or something so I should probably write a review huh?

So I've been in probably four times and liked it four times, in particular the guacomole burger with bacon and grilled onions.  They make a good, straightforward guac here, no tomato to adulterate it, no bastardization with mayo or some other foreign spread.  Just avacados, peppers, maybe some lime or lemon juice and some salt.  That's all guac needs really.

Service has been great every time, the prices are reasonable...people, why aren't more of you eating here?  

This is a great local spot for burgers, BLT's and the like.
