Ordered delivery through yelp on a whim. We got pelmeni, chicken tenders and Russian cake. It all tasted great and home cooked, but I feel like for the price there should be bigger portions. They took exactly an hour from me submitting my order but it was worth the wait. If I really get a hankering for Russian delivery food again I'll order.
