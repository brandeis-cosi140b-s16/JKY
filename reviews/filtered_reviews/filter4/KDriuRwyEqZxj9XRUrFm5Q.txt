When you walk into Casa Ramos you think your walking into a Mexican fortress. It was amusing to see these little statues of roosters, bulls and a ox with its(private parts) showing while I was waiting for our food.As far as the meal tasted the chips and salsa were good and  plentiful. I had the fish taco's made with tilapia. It was cubed and very flavorful. The dish comes with rice and refried beans but I had rancho beans (muy bien). My wife had the veggie fajitas also that came with the side of rice and beans. Portions are a good size and the value of the meal is good on the wallet. I will be a repeat customer in the future.
