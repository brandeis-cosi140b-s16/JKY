Hole in the wall - YES
Great food - YES
Like many hole in the wall places, people must get past the location and language barrier. If you can't get past that,go to taco bell and shut it. Is it perfect, no. Is the food good with great portions for the lrices, heck yes! If you're unsure of what to order, stay with go-to plates, Carne Adada tacos or Pork Flautas aka Taquitos are pretty tasty! I had the gordita combo. What I enjoyed was that  they arrived it so the corn breading wouldn't get soggy! Huge plus! Give this a shot - it's pretty good.
