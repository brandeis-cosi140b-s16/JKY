I love this place. The food is AMAZING! 
MUCH BETTER THAN THE CHAIN MEXICAN RESTAURANTS
I usually go around lunch time and I always get the Shredded beef taco, cheese enchilada plate.
BEWARE THEY DO NOT TAKE RESERVATIONS 
If you go during the lunch period of 10:45-1:30 allow yourself 2 hours because there is almost always a 30 minute wait but IT IS WORTH THE WAIT!
Parking is crazy too, the lot is always full
