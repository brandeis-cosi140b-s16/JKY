So yummy!   At least, the ONE thing on the menu I can eat because I'm a vegetarian.   Bean & cheese burrito.   With plenty-o-beer.  This place is stumble-home distance for me, so happy it's there.  Staff super friendly.   Although the menu is limited for me, my friends who eat meat all raved about their selections, and I have to admit it all SMELLED good. 

Inexpensive.  Casual.  Fun.  Friendly.   Welcoming.    In my 'hood.  My favorite kinda place!
