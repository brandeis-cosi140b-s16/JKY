Come here for lunch. Come here for dinner. Come here after a drunken wander down the strip. Come here the next morning for breakfast.

Get the taco plate. Get the carne asada fries.  Get the Horchata, add tequila to the horchata outside (if you're of age, of course).

During our 4 day stay in vegas, we ate 3 meals here, 2 of which were on the same day.  The food is great, it's cheap, it's filling and fresh.  There's a nice seating area outside.
