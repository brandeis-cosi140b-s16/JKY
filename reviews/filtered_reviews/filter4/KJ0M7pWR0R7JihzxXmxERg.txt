The food is great and portions can be very large. I ordered the skirt steak (looked to be about a 12 oz portion) with pretty much a whole avodcado on top and came with a side. Delicious but a bit much before a show at the Smith Center where I am not going to bring a doggy bag in with me. My friend had the Mahi Mahi also a good portion that came with chorizo rice and a decent size arugala salad (no side came with this one). In the past, I have had the pork tenderloin and it was fantastic. I would order all three of these dishes again.
