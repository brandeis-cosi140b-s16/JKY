ISLA was the first stop on a business trip/catching up with friends stay in Vegas. It was the perfect place to eat great food for a reasonable Vegas price. The 4 of shared a large plate of chips and 3 types of salsa which was served on a funky platter.

I had a chicken burrito which was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The margaritas at ISLA were definitely worth the cash. They were extremely fresh and had a broad selection of tequila. The ambiance was very sleek and sexy yet very welcoming.
