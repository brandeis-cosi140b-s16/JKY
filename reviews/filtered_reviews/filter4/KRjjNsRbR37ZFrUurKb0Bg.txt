I love this place.  Wait staff very helpful and nice.  Beer selection was pretty good.  Being a warm day we elected to go with the Deschutes Fresh Squeezed w/ Grapefruit Juice (a.k.a shandy) per the waitress suggestion.  Hit the spot.  Tacos were really good as well.  All in all a pleasant experience.
