We visited OTB with our family friends and had a blast! Our server graciously added extra chips to our table with the four hungry kids, always a plus for families! 

We enjoyed several great dishes. Yes OTB is a chain and serves chain Mexican dishes. Their chips are always thin & crisp and the salsa has a small bite to it (depending on the jalape√±o season). Of all the entrees we tried, we liked the pulled pork fajitas were the best. OTB has added several additions to their menu. 

Our server, Lisa, took great care of us, good food and great company.
