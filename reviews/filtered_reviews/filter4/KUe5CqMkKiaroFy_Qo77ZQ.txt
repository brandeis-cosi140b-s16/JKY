A few of us had a dinner together so someone brought over their chips, salsa (spicy and mild), beans, and guacamole.  Never tried the place so this was my first exposure.  All were pretty good and you could tell freshly made. The part I was impressed by most that made this place stand out were the refried beans. At the first bite I could tell these were the real deal. Homemade and NOT made with lard. I'm not a fans of beans unless their homemade and these were it.  Can't wait to try their food.  Seeing as how the person who recommended them was Mexican herself, that's a plus for me.  She say they make their horchata so I can't wait to try everything else!  FYI - It's called "America's" b/c that's the owners name.  Has nothing to do with our actual country.
