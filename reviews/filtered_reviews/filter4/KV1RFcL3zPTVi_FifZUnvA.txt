The reviews seemed to be mixed, but my experience was quite good. Stopped in on Monday night for some grub. Place had some patrons, but not crowded.

Our server showed up promptly and was quite friendly. We started out with Queso Fundido. Their version of cheese dip. It was very good - spicy, but not overpoweringly so.

After that we moved on the obligatory taco plates. You choose either 3 street tacos or 2 gourmet tacos. There are other options, but that is the general gist of the place.

I opted for the 2 gourmet tacos. There is a pretty good selection of meat options and, if I remember correctly, a veggie one as well. I went for some meat options - 1 short rib and 1 shredded pork.

They were definitely juicy! Drippingly so.. That did not stop me from devouring both of them. The short rib was downright fantastic. Well flavored, generously portioned, and just the right amount of spice. The shredded pork was also very good.

In the end, I had a great meal at a good price.

N*joy.
