If you're looking for a restaurant to have a quiet dinner, this is NOT the place for you. On the weekends, they have 2 mariachis playing music. One mariachi sings a song, then the next one starts. It's like a dueling mariachi bar! Be prepared. It WILL be loud. The entire time. 

My family and I have been here a couple times and have been very pleased with the food. My favorite dish is the camarones al patron. My husband enjoys the shrimp empanadas. 

Next time, I think I'll try a shrimp cocktail.
