SOL Mexican Cocina gets a deserved strong rating from this Yelper! 

With a SOL location less than 10 miles from where I live it is funny I had to leave the state to try their brand of Mexican for the first time, bit I am glad I did. I found myself at SOL to attend a business dinner in their backroom with several of co-workers recently and to be fair, the visit was almost entirely positive. The service was both professional and nimble and the kitchen seemed to be firing on all cylinders throughout my meal.

The Guacamole SOL was a Tequila laced version of this Mexican favorite and featured mango, goat cheese, pepitas peppered with cilantro.  The mango adds a nice fresh and acidic kick that really calmed down the Tequila's edge. 

For an entree, I decided on trying the grilled Kobe Skirt Steak which arrived cooked to the perfect medium rare. A "Waygu-style" (read: NOT Kobe) cut ot Skirt Steak is plated along with a cilantro sauce, tomatillo salsa, grilled cebollitas & avocado. I was impressed; the steak was juicy and delicious, something I seem to ever be able to find at Mexican themed establishments. In fact, I was nervous ordering but alas, SOL came through in spades. 

One area of concern with SOL would be in the mixed drinks department as the Bourbon drinks we a tad weak and the Margarita tasted like something you would get in a red cup on a college campus. I switched to IPA quickly to curb disappointment. 

SOL Mexican Cocina is one of those 3 to 4 star "tweeners" but I figure the service and fact they actually know how to cook a steak medium rare deserves rounding up.
