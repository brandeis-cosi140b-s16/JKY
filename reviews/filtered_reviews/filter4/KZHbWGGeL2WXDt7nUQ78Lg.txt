5 stars is usually reserved for places that are without fault and cannot be missed. While I can't say that for this place but yelp currently doesn't have a 4.5 rating scale so I will be rounding down to 4. 

The restaurant in itself is a no frills place but what more than makes up for it is the fantastic food. Combining different Latin cultures the menu is a smorgasbord of different cuisines that would satisfy your cravings.

We had gluten free and vegan requirements in our group and this place can serve both. Corn tortillas for the gluten free and tofu for vegan option. I myself had the arepa and shredded chicken authenticos taco (which basically is a corn tortilla taco) and it was amazing. The melted cheese and sauces combined with the slow cooked marinated meat made for a great taco!  They also have a salsa bar for different types and heat levels of salsa. Monday's also have $2 Mexican Beers. 

All in all a great visit and will definitely be returning.
