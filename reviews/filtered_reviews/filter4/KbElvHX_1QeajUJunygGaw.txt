We wanted to do girls night out right by starting off with dinner and drinks. Yolos was in our hotel so it became our dinner destination. Be sure to make reservations because it can be quite a wait come dinner time. 

Like most Mexican restaurants, they start you off with chips and salsa. Salsa was good although a bit garlicy. Chips were fresh and not greasy so that was nice. We had a couple appetizers (crab cakes and shrimp ceviche) and fajitas. Everything tasted good and service was great. The drinks, although good were, too sweet for my taste. 
The decor is cute too. I felt it had more a girly vibe because of the all the hot pink. Convenient location and worth trying if your staying at the hotel.
