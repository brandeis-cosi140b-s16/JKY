Sometimes there can be a wait, but the food is usually tasty. Chips and salsa with three yummy salsas to choose from are a highlight. Service is usually good- every once in awhile it is slow though. Prickly pear margaritas are a must if you like sweet drinks. Duck pond great for kids ( and me if you're an animal person!).
