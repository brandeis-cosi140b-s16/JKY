Very good asada tacos which is not easy to find in Phoenix. Both quesadillas are also very good, the mini and the full-size. It's only a four star because of the limited menu choices. The pricing is about as cheap as your going to find.

This place delivers excellent flavor and a good price point. The service is quick and helpful. The employees make you feel welcome and at home even though it's outdoors. 

If you are craving Mexico style street tacos this is about as close as you're going to get in the Phoenix area. If anybody knows a better taco stand please let me know.
