Ummmm!  HELL YEAH!!  I eat here almost every Tuesday for Taco tuesday, when the tacos are $1.50.  Its freaking delicious.  There is two types of cheese on the tacos, and it goes faaaaar!  I LOVE the tempura fish tacos, and any of the pork tacos, but the beef and chicken werent too impressive.  I also had the crawdad one, pretty yummy. I like the tex mex rice better than the cilantro one, both the refried beans and the black beans are good, not super fanastic, but not gross. The nachos are GIANT.  They will feed two people, and they are very generous with their toppings.  Lots of meat.  :)

ONE bad thing, why the heck are the beer glasses so damn HUGE and heavy!  Its hard to hold comfortably. I think they are the glasses for margaritas, and i get that its prolly easier/cheaper  to have a one size fits all glass, but damn.  Not a deal breaker though.  I WILL be back.
