Kool small joint, reminds me of the Mission District in my old San Fran hood.  Authentic street food. Cheap prices, strong salty Patron Margaritas. Insane horchata in 
a huge glass ?40 oz???   Ridiculous slow service on Saturday nights.  Chips not salted but thats ok because of the kick ass salsa collection.
