This is one of a kind - unique Chinese x Mexican restaurant in town. I know this place is expensive for Mexican and Chinese,,, but I keep visiting there.

To start with, I always order a drink with Tuna Ceviche. I have eaten Scallop Ceviche, but tuna is way better than scallops, I think.

I would recommend the Chinese inspired taco, Viva China. They are very tasty. Fish taco was really good, too.

For dim sum, I recommend "when pigs fly", its a BBQ pork buns. Delicious (its a bit sweet side, tho).

All the sui mai is very good. Gold leaf on Sui Mai??? Funny but they are good.

However, noodles in the lower price range, Kao Lao Lao and Dan Dan Mian are my least favorite. The taste is flat - too greasy and boring. I dont recommend. I guess you get what you pay for. 

Soup,,, they are OK.

Bartender was super nice and explained everything I asked.
