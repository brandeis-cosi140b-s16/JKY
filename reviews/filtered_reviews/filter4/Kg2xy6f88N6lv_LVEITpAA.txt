Favorite Mexican food around. Just very expensive. Not sure if I would go there if I had to pay, was on business.

Table side Guacamole is really good and they make it to your spice level. Which is great!

Food was really good, but pricey.
Got a pitcher of Margaritas and it was very good. The bar is a good place to pop in for a good Margarita, but I don't like to pay for many drinks when in Vegas. Large tequila selection and bartenders are very helpful in selection.
Price is the only thing that keeps this from getting 5 stars.
