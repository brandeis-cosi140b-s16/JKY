It has taken a while for me to review on my experience but I will say over all it always has been a pleasure. My rating is mainly on service. I have only had chips and salsa along with drinks. My first time I ate my snack and drink was in the small dining area out side the little shop. The staff is friendly. This is actually my little stop for a quick drink. The infused flavored water is the best. Daily fresh fruit infused in the water is mighty tasty. I hope to be back soon to try the rest of the menu.
