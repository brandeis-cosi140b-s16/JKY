The chips and salsa are well worth the $2.50; they're completely home-made and light and airy and yet dense and satisfying. Also delicious.

I had two carnitas tacos and I must say that they were the best carnitas I've had in my life. The pork was shredded and tender, marinated in a bewitching blend of spices and lime. I've never tasted pork with so much flavor. I highly recommend them!

The service was a bit frustrating. There were 4 people in the restaurant, my friend and I were 2 of them! Yet there was still a mistake on our order, the food took a bit longer than I thought it should have (we both ordered the carnitas tacos; how hard is it to assemble 4 tacos?) but once I tasted the food all of my complaints about the service floated away. The food was also hot and well-presented. The servers were nice enough and as long as they keep feeding me such flavorful, authentic food at such reasonable prices I'd let them kick me in the face.

But they wouldn't do that. They're nice.

Bottom line: Las Velas is worth a try. The carnitas are worth risking a concussion for.
