I LOVE mexican food!!  I am always looking for another good spot to feed my addiction.  I am happy to say I found one that is always just a couple of miles from my house!!  I love the atmosphere here.  I went in for lunch and the place is bright and cheery.  I thought the tables and the chairs were so cute.  The chairs had sunflowers carved on them and painted a sunny yellow.  So cheery!!  

My server brought me a basket of chips and four.....yes four dips!!  The traditional red salsa, a sour cream and jalapeno dip, a bean dip with bits of chorizo in it, and a spicy green salsa that had tons of flavor!!  I love tortilla chips and these were fresh and hot!  The perfect chip in my opinion.  My server told me that they have a tortilla factory in New Mexico and they get the tortillas fresh a couple of times a week to make their own chips.  YUM!!!  They have a lunch special every day and my day was Sopapillas.  They give you a choice of red or green sauce, I chose red cause, yes, I am a wimp.  I can't take a lot of heat.  It was yummy and saucy.  The plate came with two delicious sopapillas filled with ground beef and generous portions of rice and beans.  My only complaint was the filling.....it needed something, maybe some green chiles or some other thing to spice it up just a bit.  They were good, just a bit bland.  The rice and beans were great!  The rice was nice and fluffy and the beans were topped with lots of cheese.  And the other amazing part was that they give you a sopapilla for dessert too!!  I got a cinnamon sugar one and it was heavenly.  I thought I would only eat a bite cause I was so full but I ended up eating the whole thing!!  

I will defintly be going back to Si Senor!!  The food was great, service was fast and friendly and I have a feeling I will be craving those chips and dips again soon!!!
