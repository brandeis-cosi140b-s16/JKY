I've been here twice, once for a lunch date and again for a last minute Halloween dinner. All of the tacos except the chicken are delicious. The popcorn is a nice touch and perfect snack.

Each time we've had the happy hour menu available as they do a daily reverse happy hour in addition to a daily regular happy hour. The drinks are a little pricey but delicious. 

I had the shrimp for dinner in a chimichurri sauce with tomatoes and Serrano peppers. Amazing! I did expect more than two shrimp, but they are huge and it was surprisingly filling. I definitely recommend getting an appetizer. 

 The bartenders started cleaning up at 11 pm and didn't ask us if we wanted another drink...instead they took our glasses and didn't say a word. I was a bartender so I totally understand the concept of cleaning up early, but I always ask for a last call beforehand. 

My boyfriend and I had only had one drink each at this point. We finally ordered another drink but after we ended up leaving and going to another bar because of this, otherwise we would have stayed. 

Other than that, I love this place and we will definitely be back soon!
