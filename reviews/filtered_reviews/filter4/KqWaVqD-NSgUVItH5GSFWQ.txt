So I only went here because it was 10 on a Sunday night, and I guess all mexican restaurants in the area close before then. So this was the last option.

And I was REALLY surprised. The manager offered us free drinks, I had the best tostada in town, and the chips and salsa were really good too.

Overall, we paid 10 bucks for a great meal.

By the way, if you like people-watching, this place is a must-go. My boyfriend and I were entertained the entire time!
