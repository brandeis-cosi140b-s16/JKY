Much better, La Ristra! Much better! 

Went back the next night, Sunday, and sat at the bar. There was no one in there and the baseball game was on so it was a good time to drink, you got it, MORE MARGARITAS. I think they should just turn the place into a margarita bar and build on a room for me so I didn't have to go far for the cactus pear margarita. As it is now it's a 15 minute wait from the craving to the delicious taste of those margaritas touching my lips.

I ordered exactly the same thing I did the night before. And guess what? It was steaming hot AND delicious. I couldn't ask for more. The only glitch was that the egg came out over hard on my enchiladas instead of sunny side up, but they fixed it quickly and I was back to enjoying my food again. It was sublime! 

I love this place. Even the waiter, Brad, who waited on me came by and said he was having an off night and to come by again and he'd kick ass for me. I'm totally taking him up on that.  Ken is another waiter with awesome suggestions for drinks/food/etc. He's super personable and I really like his friendliness. They really have great people working there. 

I have now changed my review to: GET THE HELL THERE AS FAST AS YOU CAN.
