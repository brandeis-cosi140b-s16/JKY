I have been on a quest for good Mexican ever since I relocated to AZ and for the most part what I have found is mediocre food at best. I happened upon this place by reading reviews right here on Yelp. Although I am a fan of Man vs Food I have not seen the episode where this location is featured but apparently many others have. After reading the rave reviews I had to check this place out and let me tell you I highly recommend this joint. 

The food:
My friend and I ordered Taco's, a Quesadilla and the Del Rey Torta all of which were wonderful. The serving sizes are large. They are not stingy here. The presentation is nice also. The Del Rey Torta is huge and definitely needs sharing. We also ordered the Aguas Frescas in strawberry and mango and they were wonderful as well. If you are in the area definitely check this place out.

Note. This place gets packed. I visited at 11am on a Saturday and people were lined up to be seated. While my party was seated almost immediately service from that point forward was substandard but the food made the wait for service worth it.
