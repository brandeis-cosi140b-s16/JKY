This is a solid place that is fun to attend after a long day of work. They have a pretty good happy hour for drinks ($2 Lone Star beers and I believe $2.50 taps) along with a wide variety of intriguing looking soft tacos all of which are around $2-3 each. The tacos are not authentic, but most are creative and loaded with the sort of ingredients americans crave. The best way I could describe it is a Red Robin menu in a tortilla. There are variety of different meats and veggies, usually all accompanied by multiple garnishes, seasonings and sauces.

I've tried several tacos there, but my favorite so far is the Taco Al Pastor. The combination of pork, pineapple and melted jack cheese just works so well together from a texture and flavor standpoint.

The salsa bar is nice, but none of the salsas are really outstanding.

The prices are great. I was there with three buddies and our total for a meal and several beers was under $50. The previous week I went to the Great Dane with just one friend and between the two of us we spent about the same. It'll be hard to justify that trip again.
