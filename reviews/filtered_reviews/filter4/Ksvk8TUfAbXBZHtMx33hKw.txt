Wait with a reservation: very long on a Friday night 

Service: pretty good. Friendly staff but took a while to take our orders. 

Food: excellent. I had the taco salad and would definitely order it again. 

Drinks: margaritas were super strong. I'm average when it comes to alcohol tolerance but 2 margaritas did me in.
