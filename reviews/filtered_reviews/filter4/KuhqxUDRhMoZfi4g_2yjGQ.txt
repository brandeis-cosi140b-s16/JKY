We came on a Friday night and the place was quite busy.  We sat at the bar and had a margarita.  I tried the Artic Margarita which is an $8 special on Friday nights (usually $12).  That's nice it's a special for $8 because I really don't think any mixed drink is worth $12 - unless it straight up. The Artic Margarita is good.  I also had the watermelon margarita with a muddled jalapeno. One of the guys had the really peppery margarita which in a way was good but you'd better like spicy.

I have to agree with the rest of the reviewers - the chips are the best!  and the red and green salsa are great as well.  I went for the 2 taco dish ($10 - can't beat that).  I ordered the grilled white fish taco and the skirt steak taco.  Plenty of food and delicious.  Everything looks and tastes fresh.  Everyone at the table really enjoyed their meal.

I did notice that there was a kids menu, so we will definetly be coming back with the kids as well.

One thing I did notice was that the bar scene didn't seem very active.  We left about 9:45p on a Friday night and the place was empty.  Seemed that people just come to eat.  Though they have an extensive margarita menu and a full bar.
