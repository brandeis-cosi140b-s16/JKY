Tako is a great restaurant! They really have it down. The food was delicious, the service was good, absolutely loved the atmosphere and decor..my only complaint was the music was playing WAY TOO LOUD! I get it..they're going for the "hip trendy" bar thing with a live DJ, which is cool but if you can't even hear the person sitting right next to you that's just too loud. But besides that the food was perfect! Started with the chips and salsa, which comes with a selection of 3 different salsas..all very good! They also have a "build your own" guacamole menu! LOVE IT! I've never been to a restaurant where you can pick whatever you want to add to your guacamole dip. Ordered the basic guacamole and added mangoes and fried onions. Delicious! Also ordered the fish tacos which were so good. The fish was nice and crispy, not greasy and lots of flavor in the taco. I do wish they sold their tacos individually instead of 2 per order. That way you can order 2 different types of tacos instead of getting 2 of the same thing. 
You can never have too many taco joints around the city and I really hope Tako sticks around!
