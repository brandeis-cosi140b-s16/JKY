The food is awesome.  Ask anyone here or just look at the reviews below.  And honestly, despite my own criticisms I never miss a chance to eat here.  In addition to the excellent food, the atmosphere is fun and high energy.   It's unique to Phoenix.

Now for the few complaints: 

1. It's loud.  Especially at dinner.  There is nothing to absorb any of the surrounding conversations or any of the music playing.  Expect to lean in to hear everyone in your party.  

2. Cocktails are pricey.  If you have more than one, it will cost more than your food.  As of this weekend they were between $8 and $10. Fortunately, the food is inexpensive even with the slight price hikes in the last year.  

3. You're never going to get great service.   The wait staff will make you feel a little rushed or abandoned.  Luckily, none of them are offensive so this is easy to ignore.  

All and all, I've never had a bad time in the dozen or so times I've been here.  The guacamole, white sangria, and chilaquiles are excellent.  You should order them.  For dinner.  Tonight.
