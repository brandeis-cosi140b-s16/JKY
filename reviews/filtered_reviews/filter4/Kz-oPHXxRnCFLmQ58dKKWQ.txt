The food is great and the wait time is even better. I've ordered from here about 4 times and if the boy deliveries he is on time and ask if I need anything else and if everything is correct.  If the girl deliveries she is an hr late, has to stop at the front office to get a map of the apartment complex and forgets half the food in the car. The amount of food is more than enough to get you full and is extremely cheap. Every time I had a problem they were sympathetic and accountable.
