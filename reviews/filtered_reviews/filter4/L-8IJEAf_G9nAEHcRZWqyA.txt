I love Border Grill in Santa Monica so we were excited to try Broder Grill while i Vegas. Let me tell you first off this restaurant is at least a mile from the lobby. it is tucked in the far end of Caesars Palace and took forever to get too.

Once we got there we were famished and went straight in to the Guacamole and the salsa and chips. The Guac was one of the best renditions I've had and the chips were the original double cut mexico tortilla chips. The 3 Salas were complex and flavorful and we killed the whole thing.

My wife ordered the $16 chicken quesadilla which was diaapointing and I ordered the 3 taco (mini) combo. The Carne Asada was grass fed which I liked but it was covered in a garlicky sauteed spinach which killed it in a bad way. The ensenada fried fish taco was epic and the grilled fish taco was really good as well. The beans and rice were nothing special but I was still full from the Guacamole. 

The service was a 10 and would definielty come back to get the Guac and try some ceviches.
