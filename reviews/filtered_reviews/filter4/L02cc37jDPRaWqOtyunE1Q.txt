We were greeted right away. Asked if it was our first time. Taken right to our table. I like the wide openness of the place. Not a million people on top of each other. The server one of two took our drink order. Then brought us chips, salsa and bean dip. They were all delicious. I enjoyed the chips. Fresh and not greasy. They then brought us peppers and onions. My DH liked those also. 
I had the fajitas, had to try the famous flaming fajitas. They were good. I like the char on the beef. The sides of rice and beans were seasoned perfectly. The DH had the tamales. He enjoyed them. Said they were quite tasty. The portions are generous. Both plates were enough for two. We had plenty of leftovers and no room for dessert. 
The service was spot on. Perhaps too many people asking if we were doing OK. Especially when ones mouth is full. LOL 
A really nice pleasant dinner. We will be back.
