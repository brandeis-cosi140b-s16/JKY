I love this place. The Pecan Salsa alone is enough to keep me coming back. The Horchata is divine and the brunch offerings are filling and hearty. We shared a Traditional (Cheese) Queso which was filled to the brim with Oaxaca cheese. It was not one of those flat Quesos you find at most places. It looked more like a turnover with it's flaky tortilla dough. We each had a burro and should have split one as they were enough for a meal by themselves. We noticed their Happy Hour Street Taco deal right after ordering so that will have to wait for another visit. Pecan Salsa oh how I love you.
