Love! I was worried when we sat down. The prices shocked me but I had never been to Vegas and had yet to learn, that is what ALL prices look like. I ordered the chicken quesadilla and the coconut pina colada drink. My oh my!! They were both fantastic. We also ordered a side of chips and salsa, can you say Fresh and Hot!? Also, the cilantro rice is amazing. All in all we will be back! Just with more cash.
