I visited this place for an event showcasing other local South Madison eatery's and I am definitely a fan.  I actually cannot believe that I have not been here before.  The food is fantastic!  I ordered the tacos with rice and beans, so simple but so good.  The meat was really tender and well seasoned.  I should also mention that the chips and salsa pre-taco were also really good; you are given two options, one with kick and one without.  Both options were really good.  

I look forward to coming back to this place and trying many things on the well sized and well priced menu.
