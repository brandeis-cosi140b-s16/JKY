Start off with a margarita in the air conditioned bar, because it's the coolest (temp) spot they have. If you don't know what a swamp cooler is (east coasters, this means you) you'll soon find out.

Back to drinks & food. Margs are great and the bartender was friendly while my friend and I waited for a table outside.

I love the tamales so we got an order of them and the combo chicken and steak fajita which were just ok. The chicken was a little dry and the steak while good was not cut in to easy to eat sizes and frankly making up your tortilla was not easy.

Get the margs & tamales and you're safe.
