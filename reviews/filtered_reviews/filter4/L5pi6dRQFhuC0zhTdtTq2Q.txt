We really enjoyed the meal and the service here. We'd been to the one in Newport Beach. I had taco enchilada combo. My wife had the spinach enchiladas and cannot stop talking about them. There were four of us altogether and it was a great experience. The menu has a lot of choices. Would readily go again.
