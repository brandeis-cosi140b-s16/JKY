I had heard about this place and was excited to try them and doubly excited when I saw the Groupon pop up recently. We headed there for a quick lunch. This place has a very simple concept. Burritos, tacos, bowl and salads a la Chipotle with Hawaiian flavors. They offered us samples of their different protein options before we ordered. We really liked the huli huli chicken so my fella and I both opted for this choice. I ordered the bowl and he the salad, although they had pretty much the same ingredients from what I could see. You choose all the toppings you want. I opted for seaweed rice with grilled vegetables as an add on with corn salsa, cabbage, romaine lettuce, sour cream and cheese. My fella got the same, but added black beans to his. 

All the ingredients were incredibly fresh and made from recipes personally created by the owner. It was fantastic. He even came around to everyone's table to make sure everyone was enjoying their food and let us know he created all the recipes himself. Everything we had was fantastic and I made sure to buy a few more Groupons for our next few visits. They have a drive thru as well, which is incredibly convenient.  

Make sure you to like their Instagram and Facebook for daily promotions. Sunday was Slipper Sunday and we got free chips and guacamole since my fella was wearing sandals.
