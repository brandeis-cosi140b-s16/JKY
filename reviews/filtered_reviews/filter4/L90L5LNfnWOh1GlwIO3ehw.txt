Great food, always remember to check the specials board.  They do get one star off for having below par margaritas .... but again the food is great.  The service is always friendly.  They also have vegetarian dishes .... kudos to them for that.

I suggest trying the Carnitas, the Chicken and the Queso Fundido with Chorizo.
