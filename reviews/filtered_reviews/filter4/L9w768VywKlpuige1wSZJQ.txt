Popped in here by myself for dinner right after opening at 5pm.   Decided to go with the Adovada "Burro" (pork burrito) combo w/rice and beans and a Negro Modelo to quench the flames.

No complaints about the service on my particular visit, although I would guess that it was actually the owner who served me.  I was checked up on a couple of times by two different people after being served.  

I appreciated the fact that an entire pitcher of ice water was set in front of me along with the chips and salsa, although I wondered if this was an ominous foreshadowing of things to come. 

The food came out fast, and when I dug in I was not disappointed in either the flavor or the spiciness.  My head was already preheated with the chips and salsa, so by the time I started on the burrito, I had to pace myself.  Each bite packed a powerful punch, and several times I had to stop eating and let the perspiration and hot flashes subside before carefully sawing off another non-lethal dose.

The atmosphere was alright, not exactly the most enchanting mexican restaurant I've ever been in, but I did dig the music. 

Beer was $4.25 and the the entre was approx $11, total with tax came to $17.50.   It was a lot of food, so I took half home. 

I'll have to come back to give the tortillas and margaritas a shot.
