Chips and Salsa is good, not great... I prefer my salsa spicy vs sweet.....
Corn salad was excellent! (Wish they served it hot instead of cold)
Neighboring table had the Queso Modelo which looked amazing! Will definitely try next time!

Baja Fish Tacos are delicious!!! A very good portion of perfectly fried fish and then some cold slaw and REAL guacamole, next time I will order a little extra of the chili-lime crema sauce...
Crispy Taco is a really good flavorful ground beef, but a little to heavy on the mashed potatoes for me.... still, and excellent taco.... I will definitely order again.
What is better?????  Order the Carne Asada with the crispy shell.... Yay!!

Went for lunch during the work week...... couldn't drink  :(  can't wait to go back and try the margarita!
