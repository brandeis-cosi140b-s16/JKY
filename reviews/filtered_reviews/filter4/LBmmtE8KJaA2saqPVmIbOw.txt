My mother-in-law and I tried their tequila sampler here when my in-laws were in town. While my father-in-law couldn't drink that night, he enjoyed the food immensely, which means a lot as he's a very talented chef.

While my wife and I have visited a few times for drinks, we've only eaten here a couple times. The last time we were here, we noticed that the portions seemed to be getting smaller. However, the tequila sampler is the way to go as you can get the equivalent of three shots for less than what three shots will cost you.
