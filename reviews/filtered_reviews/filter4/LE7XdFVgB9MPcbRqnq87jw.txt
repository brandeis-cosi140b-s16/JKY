Street tacos right on the Strip of Las Vegas!

It's not as dingy and dink as most places I'm used to, but being on a prime location I think they do pretty well up keeping the place.

I ordered the El Pastor, Carnitas, Carne Asada, and Lengua -- Ci yo soy mucho hambriento!  How you gusto me Spanish!?  They didn't put any sauce a top, which for me was odd since the hot sauce is that extra kick that does it for me.  I had to ask for some on the side which was not a problem.  Overall, the lengua was blah, the carnitas was good, but my favorites were the Carne Asada and El Pastor.  Guess they had those ready and popping since I gather these are the popular choices.  The sauce which gave it some kick along with the lemon and onions really helped keep the meat moist.  Wrapped with a soft corn tortilla this street taco was yummy and very rare can you find a place that makes it this good!  

Definitely a recommended taco joint if you're strolling the streets of Vegas and need a quick bite to give you that energy boost! - Enjoy!
