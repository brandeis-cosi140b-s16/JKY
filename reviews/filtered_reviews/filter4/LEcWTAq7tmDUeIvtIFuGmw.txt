Oh Someburros...you are better in my memory than in real life...but Oh what memories....
When I was in high school and lived in AZ my best friends and I would get Someburros all the time...it was where the entire universe was discussed and unfolded. Sometimes we would just get chips and salsa to go, but being there was better.
Recently, I had Someburros on a trip to Phoenix, and was able to introduce my husband and baby to the joy that is Someburros. Not much has changed. I still love their salsa, which is really an amazing hot sauce. See...as soon as I get back to MN I dream about it!
Things I love include the cheese enchiladas, the chicken burrito, and more recently, the chicken burrito with jalepeno cream cheese. But really, it's all good. And cheap. And a thousand times better for your memory and well-being than Taco Bell.
