I've been here a couple times and have to say its good. I'm not going to say its great but its good food for the price. I ordered a Chile Relleno and shredded beef taco combo with rice and beans. for around eight bucks. Chile Relleno was tasty but I didn't enjoy the taco much ( it needed more flavor). Staff is very friendly and very comfortable atmosphere.
