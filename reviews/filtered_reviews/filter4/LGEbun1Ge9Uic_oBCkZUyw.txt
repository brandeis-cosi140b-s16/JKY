Yum! I have been here two times. Today I had the Lengua and Fish Tacos. Super yummy. Last time I was here I had the Shrimp Tacos, those were super good as well. I will say though the fish was a bit tough like it was cooked earlier in the day, but still good. Definitely order at least 3 tacos, they are small street tacos, so it takes more than two to get filled up. I probably in all honesty could eat four and be comfortable full. The carmelized onions and jalepeno on the side are what makes them yummy, so dont leave those off.Try it, you wont regret it.
