Came here for a wedding. Parking was adequate though I kind of thought there would be more space given the size of the venue. 

Service was good. My friends who were getting married got a nice mexican buffet set up with a open bar. As you would've figured, we all got wasted and ate a bunch of food which was pretty delicious. The decor was pretty nice but unfortunately it got a little dirty since the only time the marrying couple had was during the summer to get married and it turned out that it was going to sprinkle a little bit preceeding a heavy dust storm. Dust got everywhere since it was an outside venue and since it's Phoenix during the summer, you can imagine the heat though since it was afternoon, it wasn't entirely as bad as if it were during noonish. 

The wedding procession was really nice. I arrived fashionably late but just in time for bar open and proceeded to drink heavily. They had rented the venue until about close time and before kitchen closed, I was hungry again because I'm a fat ass and ordered another enchilada meal which came with rice and beans. It was pretty delicious. Pricing was decent. 

All in all, a good time. Outside of the venue area, in the bar and band area, people were drinking and listening to live music. I guess this place gets pretty packed with people during the weekend.
