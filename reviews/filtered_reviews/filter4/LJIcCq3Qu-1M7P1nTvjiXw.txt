Diablo's (at the Monte Carlo) is a place that's better for lunch than for dinner.
During the day, they're not crowded, you can get seated quickly, the drinks are good, and the food is very good. I had the fish tacos which were very tasty, but they leave quite a mess on your hands.
The daytime service is good, as well.
At night, they are jam-packed, you have to wait for a table, and the service is slow.
As an old fart, I prefer the slower atmosphere during the day.
Between my wife and me, we had two beers, the guacamole/chips starter and two entrees and the bill was $55.
Sounds expensive for lunch, but it's Las Vegas. (this is the point where I roll my eyes.)
