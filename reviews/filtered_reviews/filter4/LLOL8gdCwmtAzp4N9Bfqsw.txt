This is an unexpectedly large Mexican restaurant in the northwest part of town. For some reason, I get that authentic vibe that is hard to manufacture. It's a nicely architected and decorated restaurant.

I was here one night thanks to Ken M and his creative UYEs. This time, it was Tamales and Brewskies. Dona Maria, of course, was the tamales side of that equation. Not wanting to mess around, we decided to order a dozen tamales. Then again, why wouldn't you? It's certainly the cheapest option. I don't remember the exact price points, but it's something like $5 for a single tamale versus about $3 each if you buy a dozen.

There are four tamales to choose from - red, green, cheese, and sweet. The red is pork, the green is chicken, the cheese is cheese (imagine that), and the sweet is pineapple and raisins. I actually enjoyed them all.

I wasn't that hungry on this night, so that was all I had. I'm glad I was with a group and was able to sample all of Dona Maria's tamale offerings. It is called Dona Maria Tamales after all.
