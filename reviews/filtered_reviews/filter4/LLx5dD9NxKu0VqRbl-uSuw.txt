Just the perfect place to get away from the touristy stuff in Vegas. I've been here four times now, and it's consistent.

What a breath of fresh air! Cheap, good food, happy hour specials. 

There is no pretentiousness about this place. I would call it a semi dive, but nothing lacks...service is excellent, food is excellent. Way better than the Pink Taco across the street at Hard Rock....and your wallet will appreciate it too. I love the fish tacos. Crispy, fresh, and a spicy sauce on them. Yummy!

Until next time...
