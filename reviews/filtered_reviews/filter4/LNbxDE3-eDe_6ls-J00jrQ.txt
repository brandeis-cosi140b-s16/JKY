Came in on a Friday 5-ish for an early dinner with my friends. The place is cute, few tables, it's got a bar and 2 bathrooms. Salsa bar was awesome! There's tons to choose from.. My favorite was the salsa picante, jicama and the cilantro.. Ahhh soo good. I got the fried fish taco plate, the shark taco on the side and I also tried their horchata! The tacos were great! I love the rice it's got flavor to it and the horchata was very delicious! It's got fruit, cinnamon and nuts on top. Ok, so I didn't know it was big! I think the cup was 32oz, it's good for 2-3 people!!! The down side was the service..I don't know if the lady was stressed out because there's a lot of people and there's only 2 of them serving.. But they need to add more server/waiter during peak hours.. The guy was doing 3 jobs, at the bar, cashier and serving as well. I feel bad for them. We were waiting for our food for a long time, probably 30-40mins. When we got out of the restaurant, there was a lot of people waiting.. I will definitely come back again, just not peak hours.
