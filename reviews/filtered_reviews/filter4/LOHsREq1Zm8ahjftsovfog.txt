Great feel, great service, great food, great location, what more could you ask for?!

The margaritas were nothing special, certainly not worth the money we paid for them. The chips and guac are a must try along with the chicken fajitas.  So much flavor packed into each of the items!

The decor and feel of the place is like a true modern cantina.  Sit along the edge of the canal and watch as the gondolas circle through the end of the canal.

The server was very friendly, knowledgable of the menu, and prompt to get us whatever we needed.

Overall a great experience.  If you're looking for mexican food in this area of the strip it's worth a try!
