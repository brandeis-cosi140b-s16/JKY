LOVE this place. I live right around the corner, so I go here often. Their California burrito and carne asada fries are amazing. They put cottage cheese in their guacamole which sounds weird, but it tastes great. Their salsa can be spicy (which I like), so beware. Just a tip...if you use your debit card, your purchase must be over $5.
