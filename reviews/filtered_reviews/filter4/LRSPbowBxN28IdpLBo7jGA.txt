I agree with some of the other reviewers. The food is great, but seems a bit over priced. Combo plates range between 7-10 bucks! For a corner "dive" with no waiter service, that seems a bit much. 

The burros are delish! Something about the quality of the large tortillas they use. For starters, they're authentic. Not big, white, overly floury ones like you buy in the grocery. Folks must love 'em b/c they sell them in a package! The salsa bar is stocked w/ 3 different house made salsas, pico de gallo, and jalapenos w/ marinated carrots and onions. Not all salsas are made alike! I love theirs! 

Enjoy!
