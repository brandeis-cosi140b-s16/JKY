Brought a friend here for his first taste of Arizona Mexican food. It was the perfect place to start with the chimis and tequila. Service was speedy and attentive even on a busy Saturday night. Not a huge fan of the salsa and hot sauce but the fabulous dinner platters make up for it. Red chili chimi is my recommendation.
