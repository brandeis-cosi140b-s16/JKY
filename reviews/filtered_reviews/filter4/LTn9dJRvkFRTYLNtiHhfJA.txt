Pretty dang good Mexican food at a decent price.  The food is consistent and you always know what to expect.  As long as there isn't a line it's pretty fast since the food is made similar to Subway's assembly line of pre made foods.  I pretty much just always get the pork salad but their other stuff is pretty good too.
