Interesting addition to East Blvd!  Hopefully it helps bring back some life to the area. The atmosphere is great, super casual but packed and lively. Everyone is here to have a good time. 

The bar tables are ridiculous. The concrete top is only inches larger than the barrel base, so you cannot sit under the table at all. You have to sit sideways at the table.  If I had waited an hour and a half to get that table, I would be pissed.  Fortunately, we were sat at a hightop near the bar with regular seats.  Other than the grotesquely under-estimated wait time, the service was really good.

The tacos were interesting, but out of the four we tried I'm not sure I would eat any of them again. For me the food to go back for is the baked cheese dip and the tostadas.

The cheese dip is not your standard Mexican fare.  It has an awesomely bruleed top but eat quickly or it will get stringy and hard and cold.

The potato tostada was fantastic! Served in a cold iron skillet, with a bottom layer of dressed romaine salad, it has two layers of fresh made crispy tostada shells. Separated by beans and crispy potato cubes, it has a great balance of flavor and texture. The green sauce on the table adds a lot to it.  

Definitely a good addition to the restaurant/bar scene.
