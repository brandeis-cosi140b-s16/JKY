Went here close to a month ago and just getting around to posting a review. We've tried several other restaurants at the Cosmo and have become fans of the resort and it's food offerings. The experience started off not so great, with the hostess service a bit frenzied and disorganized. There was no one at the hostess area and a bunch of us milling by the entrance not sure what was going on. Once seated, everything changed. The server was awesome...cheerful, knowledgeable and attentive. The service seemed a bit rushed at times. We ordered six different things and the time in between servings was sometimes not enough. I have no problem with the portions, which are on the small side and for the most part really aren't suitable for sharing unless you order a bunch of things.   I'm always about quality and not quantity, and the quality was excellent. These dishes, sauces, etc. aren't just slapped together. They are creative, complex and well executed. The prices for small plates is high, but again, Cosmo on the Strip, what do you expect.  Now for the food: 

Vegetable spring roll - delicious, but nothing really set it apart from all the other good spring rolls. 

Dan Dan Mian - wheat noodles in a spicy pork sauce. OMG. It's been a month and I still can't stop thinking about it. 

20 vegetable fried rice. The price will blow you away, but have to say we really enjoyed it. The time and effort that goes into this dish is incredible and you can literally identify all 20 vegetables finely chopped in perfect proportions. 

Carnitas taco - awesome. The spicy verde cruda sauce...I asked for a side dish of it and almost drank it. 

Pancita al pastor. Had never tried pork belly, and the combination with pineapple was intriguing. Good, but not my favorite. 

Queso Fundido - outstanding, with a nice slightly burnt top to the cheese, perfect texture and great tortillas.

The beer was cold but could have been colder.

Will definitely be back.
