Quite possibly the best authentic Sonoran Mexican food in Arizona, no wait anywhere!!

This place seems like a total dump, but trust me the food is awesome! 

Try their cheese crisps, chili relleno (anyone who likes this dish knows it pretty much sucks most places), Shrimp fajita burrito pollo fundito style... Some of their chicken dishes are not great, as I am not a huge fan of shredded chicken. Opt for the fajita meat instead.

Try hitting this place during dinner time on the weekend, and you will understand why all the locals to sunny slope don't tell anyone about this place. Unfortunately the wait during peak hours sucks, but worth the wait! Parking can suck so just park in the neighborhood behind the restaurant. Also, *some* of the servers are not great, but again, the food is worth it.
