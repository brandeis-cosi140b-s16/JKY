Recommended both by Yelp and my Vegas junkie friends. The inside kinda looks like a Wendy's that serves tacos.

After discovering that the location on the Strip had closed down, we ventured to this branch on Charleston Boulevard, only to be met with the long lines nearly coming out the door. A couple of us scoped out a table, while the others waited in line. We decided to go for broke and order a little bit of everything, which meant waiting in each of the different lines, since each line served a different type of meat. The wait took about 20 minutes, but we were rewarded for our patience.

My favorite were the al pastor, cabeza, and carne asada tacos. The asada tacos had that delicious char that you get with grilling over the fire, which was awesome. The cabeza tacos were great too, albeit a bit on the fattier side. We got a few of the vampiros which were bomb as well. The horchata tasted freshly made and not too sweet. The crown jewel, though, was easily the carne asada fries. A bunch of shoestring fries, topped with cheese, carne asada, guac, and a variety of sauces. A huge portion for $10, and they don't skimp on the meat. So bomb. Comes with some grilled vegetables and different fixings, which are pretty tasty.

The service is relatively quick, the prices are cheap, and the food is very satisfying. Definitely will be back when I'm back in Vegas and hopefully not dead from being chased by loan sharks. Ha.
