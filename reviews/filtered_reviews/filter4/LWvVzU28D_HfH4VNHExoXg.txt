ACCESSIBILITY REVIEW
No complaints what so ever.  They don't have a restroom.  I asked for one and they just pointed me toward the casino restrooms.  All-in-all, the wheelchair accessible restrooms in Nevada for the most part suck worse than those in California.

RESTAURANT REVIEW
This place is located inside of the Planet Hollywood Casino.  Don't ask me where exactly because even if I tell you, you'll probably still get lost.  It (the Planet Hollywood Hotel & Casino) is huge and it's just retarded.

I was seated immediately.  I got my chips and salsa, ordered my drink and then the manager came out to greet me.  HUGE PLUS!!!  I love it when they do this.  I kindly asked him if he had hotter salsa, and he brought me out diablo sauce, which was actually too hot for me and the taste wasn't as good as the regular sauce.  Unfortunately, their sauce is like some sort of roasted thing that I don't care for.  I'd rather eat something that looks more red, not blackish.

I ordered some sort of enchilada but the server came back and said they were out.  I wasn't too happy, so I changed to the Carne Asada Ranchero.  I should've asked for medium-well.  Oh well, my fault.  The food was pretty good, it came with some sort of tamale, some weird looking rice that I'd never seen before and some black beans that I don't care for, either.  I didn't really care, I was just hungry and looking to experience the place.  I'm glad I did.  I actually found it off Vegas.com.

I can't remember what I drank, it was some minty-leafy drink with alcohol.  It was good.  I wanted to try something new rather than you run-of-the-mill margarita.
