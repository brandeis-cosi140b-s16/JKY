I love Wahoos. I am originally from Orange County so I grew up eating these every time I was near the ocean. So last year when I saw this was open, I was ecstatic to see one here in Las Vegas! I've come a few times and I enjoy the tastes of the fish tacos and the banzai bowl. For people that complain that the fish doesnt taste fresh or it seems like it was frozen, shut up. We live in Las Vegas not Seattle, so take what you can get with fish. I recommend Wahoos to anyone that likes Fish tacos or vegitarian meals.
