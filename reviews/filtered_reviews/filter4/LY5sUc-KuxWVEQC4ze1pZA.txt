Los Tacos is HELLA BOMB! 

Yes, the tacos are a bit expensive, but you're gettin' your money's worth. Melted cheese in-between two corn tortillas, topped with savory pinto beans, rice like grandma used to make, your choice of meat (my favorite is cabeza) , sour cream, guacamole, and a simple but tradtional pico de gallo. Los Tacos does not mess around! 

Sure, they aren't your traditional tacos, but they sure are tasty.
