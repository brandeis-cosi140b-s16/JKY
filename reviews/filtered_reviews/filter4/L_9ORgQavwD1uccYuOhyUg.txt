As a Mexican food expert, this place has a solid 4 star. Don't take me wrong, is way far away from the real thing, but the flavor is good, the quality is great, the ambiance is cool.

Nothing not to love about this place. 

The salsa is great and the carne al carbon is pretty tasteful. I might reduce the size of the servings, though. 

Great addition to the area!
