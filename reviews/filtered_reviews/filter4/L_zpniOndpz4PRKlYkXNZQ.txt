This might have become my favorite Mexican restaurant in town, but it's not perfect.  Since it's under Reyna's grocer it's in a basement, and it's tough to get away from that feeling.  It's not that you feel claustrophobic in there, but no windows are no windows, and it has a bit of that basement feel to it.  The decor/ambiance (aside from no windows) is nice and warm, although the decor is fairly (putting it nicely?) over the top.  

The salsa and chips are fantastic, but ask your server about the salsas.  I'm a bit (also putting it nicely) of a wuss when it comes to spicy food.  So I've ordered salsas that were a bit over my threshold, and I regretted it.  The sweet mango salsa is fantastic, but skip the guacamole.  I love some guacamole, and can make better at home.  It just doesn't really taste like anything.  

Margaritas - If you balk at the $12 price tag don't be fooled.  You essentially get at least 2 when they bring you a shaker,  so be prepared to drink up.  

In my two visits I've tried the enchiladas verde, and the tacos (steak, chicken, and chorizo).  Loved them all.  Will definitely continue visiting Casa Reyna's whenever I want Mexican food, which is quite often.
