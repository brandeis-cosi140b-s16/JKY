thanks to Groupon's $6 for $12 coupon I probably wouldn't know about this place. My first expeirence with New Mexican food so didn't know what to expect. Similar menu as your typical Mexican restuarant and a few of their own. 

Had the Steak Carlito's Burrito (pic) which i really liked for $7.60 with all of it's 8 complimentary add-ons, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, peppers, salsa, and so on. guacamole and sour cream was extra. it was loaded with tasty chunks of steak, i could definitely taste a difference in the spices and seasoning. they also have a veggie burrito for $4.60 that you can mixup all kind of beans and rice together, or the combo burrito for around $6-7 which is the veggie and meat.

Total wasn't $12 yet so I added the Pork  Nachos for also $7.60.  They weren't that bad, had a bunch of ingredients that resembled those layered nachos dips what I usually eat while watching football. beans, cheese, olives, tomatoes, peppers, guacomole, and sour cream and some large pork pieces. didn't care for their chips, shaped and seasoned like doritos, and got soggy quickly.

They have a good nightly special from 4-9pm.
Mondays - Santa Fe Sliders for $1
Tuesdays -Beef Tacos for $1
Wednesday - HUMP DAY - 1/2 off breakfast burrito till 11 am and $6 pizzas.
Thurdays - Bottomless bowls green chile shew for $6.50.
Friday - Chicken, steak, and shrimp fajitas from $6-8.
Saturaday - Ribs for $8.95
Sunday - 2 for 1 breakfast burritos all day.

they also serve beers, margaritas, and wine so that's cool.

they were busy during lunch, they had tables and a few bar counters to eat at. also like all of their pictures and their open view of the kitchen.
