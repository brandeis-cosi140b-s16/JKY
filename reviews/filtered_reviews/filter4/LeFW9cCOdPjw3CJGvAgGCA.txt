Had a wonderful meal here just this weekend. Came in around 7 and it was busy, but not packed. There was a band playing and the hostess quickly greeted and seated my friend and I. We had heard many good reviews of this place and were excited to try it for ourselves. As I'm not a huge fan of margaritas (crazy, I know), I opted for the michelada. It was fantastic with just the right amount of heat and the cayenne salt on the rim added that extra kick. We started with the tableside guacamole and like so many others have said, it was great. I enjoyed that it was chunky with a little added sweetness. For my main entree I chose the Cochinita Pibil meal. I love the many varieties of pulled pork out there and this was scrumptious. I had to stop myself from eating the whole thing and ended up taking part of it home for breakfast the next morning (it reheats wonderfully, plus throw a fried egg on top and yum!). My friend decided on the chicken torta and she very much enjoyed her meal. She thought the spicy fries were perfectly seasoned and loved that the ketchup had a smoky flavor that was undoubtedly homemade. We did not have enough room for dessert, sadly. The service was well-paced and our server took the time to happily explain anything on the menu we might have questions about. I would certainly return. This is a great Phoenix hotspot.
