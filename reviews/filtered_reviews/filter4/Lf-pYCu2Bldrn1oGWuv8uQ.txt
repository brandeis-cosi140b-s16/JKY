Went to the stand today for lunch with a bunch of our friends -- it was my first experience and all I have to say was "meh."

First of all, this place gets 4 stars because their service was EXCELLENT. Even though it was a busy lunch hour all of the staff was pleasant polite and efficient. They came to wipe down our table before we said anything, and were very prompt to clear away our trays, etc.

My husband and I got two short rib tacos, the chips and guacamole, and a large Horchata.  The only redeeming thing about the Horchata was that you got free refills -- otherwise it had way too much cinnamon and didn't taste like authentic horchata. The tacos were ok -- they are reasonably priced but all I tasted was the spiciness with no depth of flavor from the meat. The guac was standard, nothing to write home about. 

Might try this place again when I'm in the mood for a burger but for now, it's not something I'll be craving in the near future.
