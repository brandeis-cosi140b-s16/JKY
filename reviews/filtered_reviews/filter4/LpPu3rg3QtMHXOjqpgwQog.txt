I went to the original LV location in early 2013 and really enjoyed the Tacos Al Pastor. I've seen the sign at the Cheyenne and Losee intersection for at least a year and was happy to hear via Yelp that they were officially opened up in my neck of the woods.

So I went in tonight after work and there is a lot of space in there compared to the other location.  Thank God for reading the Yelp reviews or I would of been intimidated in trying to order my food. I found the comments about three lines for different meats very helpful because there were so many people waiting in various locations.  It took about 20 minutes for me to get up to the window to order my Adobada Fries. You may want to bring a spanish speaking friend or your phone so that you can google what the heck you are ordering. I was going to wing it but since I had so much time in line, I decided to use my phone to figure out what Campechana was and I'm glad I did. I almost ordered seafood fries consisting of what may have been oysters, baby octopus, mussels, shrimp and/or squid!

The restaurant was really clean and there were lots of employees who were working their arses off. The meat cutters were chopping meat like they were cutting up crack in the movie New Jack City. I hope they make their menuboard more "gringo" friendly.lol 
I really appreciated the person who stood at the door at the LV Blvd location to help you place your order. 

The food was really good. I wish I would of known to ask for no guacamole or sour cream. I just scooped if off and drowned the rest in extra sauce.  I honestly won't go out of my way to come back here with Roberto's on every corner.  The food is definitely good though and you get your moneys worth as it is very filling.
