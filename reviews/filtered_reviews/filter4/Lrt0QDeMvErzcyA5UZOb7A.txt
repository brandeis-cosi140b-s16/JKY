My experience with this place has been "so-so". I want to give it 3 1/2 stars but it wouldn't let me sooo...4 stars because it was a very clean restaurant and the employees were super nice. However, the food was a solid 3 stars. I ordered the fish and chips. So basically you get a styrofoam container full of fries (which are actually really good) and about 8 small bite size pieces of a beer batter type of fish. The fish? Well..it tasted fresh but I'm sure it wasn't fried all the way through...my stomach still feels a little weird. Anyways, they have a really nice salsa bar and it's fresh ingredients too. But I don't think I will be back...
