A solid little non-chain burger joint in the northeast part of town? Did I dream it? Nope, Fat Boy is real and it is as greaseball and delicious as it gets!

I live over here, so the trek to Fat Boy isn't far for me and lucky me, I'm within delivery distance. SORRY PANTS. For those who live anywhere else, Fat Boy is a bit of a drive and in what some would consider a dicey area of town, but really, have no fear! This place is legit. 

This is a literal hole in the wall that sits in a sad little strip mall with a laundromat, tire/repair shop and a bar. There's nothing fancy about the decor, but there's no time for fancy when your food is good. 

I've only had two things here: the chencho fries and the burger and they are both craveable. The chencho fries are basically the perfect drunk food: fries smothered in cheese and green chile sauce. You can get either the fat or skinny fries and I recommend the fat fries because I feel like I got more cheese/sauce, which is what you want! There are about four or five different kinds of burgers with your average toppings, but the execution is above average. The bread is toasted and the burgers are cooked to perfection and actually taste like beef. I know that's a weird thing to expect out of a burger, for it to taste like beef, but it was a delicious surprise in this age of fake, overly processed everything. These burgers are simple because they can afford to be.

I suggest you bring cash, not because there's any identity theft going on but because the last couple of times I went they were having major technical difficulties with the card machine. Cash makes the world go round anyway and is better for small businesses. 

Fat Boy is a great little neighborhood operation!
