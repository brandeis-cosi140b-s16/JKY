We've been to this location many times. Chips were fresh and two types of salsa were brought, both OK. We botth had the Pollo Fundito with rice and beans and it was good as always with enough for us to take home for another meal. Service was better than usual, but i forget the young guys name. Had a 2 for 1 coupon which made it a fine deal.

Food and service has always been solid on all of our visits.
