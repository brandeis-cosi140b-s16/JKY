I came here because my coworkers were all talking about how good this place was. I also heard that they had shark tacos that my bf really wanted to try. The place is super small and kind of divey. They have a salsa bar for you to enjoy when you first sit down. The strawberry salsa was my favorite. Sweet but a little bit spicy. They definitely get you on the chips though because there are no free refills like most other places. Another basket of chips is almost $3. I got the chicken mole quesadilla. Their quesadillas are definitely not like your typical quesadilla. It's almost like a deep fried calzone. The portion is huge though, I could only eat half of it. My bf got one shark taco to try and it was kind of disappointing. It tasted like cod and there wasn't very much flavoring. The taco just came with a tiny bit of lettuce and some green sauce. We got the guacamole and it was delicious. They put raisins and some other fruit in it. At first it sounds strange but trust me, it's so good. Wish we saved some chips to eat with it since we ate most of it with the salsa. The service is friendly and the food came out pretty quick. I'm glad we tried it out but don't know if I would be dying to go back.
