If you're looking for excellent, quick service: don't come here. If you're looking for some fancy, 5-star cuisine and ambiance: don't come here. If you're looking for a laid-back spot to nom on some casual fare: come here (and bring a bottle of Cuervo with you!)

I've had some of the worst service in my life, here. No exaggeration. Servers routinely know little to nothing about the menu, take an obscenely long time to accommodate requests, and time delivery of food so poorly (Yes, of course I want my appetizer to come out at the exact same time as my entree! How did you know?!) Maybe it's the vibe. Maybe it's the reggae. Maybe it's the tequila. But, somehow, the atrocious service here doesn't push my buttons the way it does at other restaurants. I forgive you, Casa Rasta... Because the food is sooooo yummy.

Diablo shrimp tacos. Soyrizo burritos. Potato flautas. The stuff that dreams are made of. I often get all three, because they're too good to choose between. It's like picking a favorite child.

Caveats: make a reservation, no matter what. There are only about ten tables, and nothing could be more heartbreaking than getting amped up to eat your weight in guacamole only to be turned away. Also, be prepared for them to run out things. Whoever handles their inventory could use some help, I think. But, all the positives outweigh the negatives, and this is one of my favorite spots in the city.
