This restaurant was not my favorite.  We visited this restaurant when we traveled to Arizona this summer for a family reunion.  After seeing it on the Food Network my expectations were a little high.  First of all, the camera angles made me think the restaurant was big when it was about the size of a Subway restaurant.  We almost had to leave because there were no seats available.  There were about 8 of us and we did not want to have to take our food to go.  Fortunately, two tables ended up leaving and we were able to sit down. 

 I got the three taco meal. I guess I should have realized that "hot sauce" meant hot but I was just thinking "oh it'll be a little spicy" NO! I took maybe two bites and couldn't finish.  I had to trade food with my niece, I ate her quesadillas which were pretty good and she didn't seem to be phased by the hot tacos.  I definitely was not satisfied when I left, I basically ate off of everyone else's plates.  If I ever return to Phoenix, I probably won't be back here.  There are several restaurants in Atlanta that are Food Network worthy, in my opinion this was not.

The customer service was very good, the ladies were very nice and excited that we mentioned the food network.
