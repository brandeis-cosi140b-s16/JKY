We enjoyed this location and the food as well. Ate here a couple of times during our stay at the HRH. First time was later in the evening and the second time during their happy hour. 

Service was fine both times and the chips and salsa were very good too. If you're daring with salsa, ask for their "diablo" or their hot salsa. It's pretty spicy and my personal taste prefers an in-between Diablo or something in their second hottest salsa. I like spicy stuff and have been complimented by Asians and Mexicans alike. It's probably because my parents weren't into spicy food and I love it. Heck I can probably drink shots of tabasco sauce but that's another story.

We enjoyed their food.. had a quesadilla, guacamole and of course the margaritas. If we are at HRH again, we'll hit this place again!
