Pinches tacos is awesome beginning with the name. Haha!
I really like to go at night because the container park becomes 21+ which means that there are no children running around, also there are only 2 indoor tables, so make sure you go on a pretty day since they have plenty of patio seating.

This place has my favorite Mexican food in Las Vegas.
The favors are pretty authentic, the staff is super friendly, the prices are very reasonable and of course, the food is amazeballs.

If you go for breakfast, try the Chilaquiles. If you go for lunch, anything will do. I've had their enchiladas, flautas, tacos, etc. Everything is always great.

You can't really leave the place without trying their blood orange margaritas, let me warn you though, THEY WILL MESS YOU UP! I am not kidding, those are not weak at all!

Some others of my faves are: Horchata, Elotes, Churros
