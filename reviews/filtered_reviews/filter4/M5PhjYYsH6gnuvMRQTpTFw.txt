Tried this place out tonight after seeing a coupon in the mail. This place is in the South Tempe area and although I thought it might be chain like, it actually isn't. We met a gentleman who seemed like the owner or at least a key employee there. He helped us pick our order (I love when folks do that) and also recommended what salsas, toppings and sauce to try for what we ordered. I had the fish taco and the machacha fish taco - both were very yummy! The machacha is steamed fish with plenty of yummy seasoning (ask for a sample if you're curious) and the fish taco is delicious battered fish. The fish tasted fresh and the batter was amazing!! My husband tried the full taco (which he said was really good) and the governer's quesadilla which he wasn't a huge fan of as he felt the shrimp was a bit over-cooked. I would stick to the tacos here. Will definitely be going back as it definitely fulfilled my fish taco craving! YUM!! 
ps - beware that they close early at 8pm. :)
