I finally tried this place out. I just opened a new nail salon on pecos and russell, so it was very convenient seeing as its only down the street and on my way home. 

It's comparable to "tacos el gordo" if you've ever been there. Set up is like they do in mexico. Walk and up order, they assemble right in front of u. Food was good. I personally like their chicken and Carne Asada. Their adobada or alpastor (red pork meat on the stick. Can't remember what it's called) is on the salty side. They give Flower tortillas for your tacos but u have to ask. They're bomb. Trust me. :) they also serve beer.
