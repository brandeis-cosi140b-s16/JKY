This is a great establishment to have in the neighborhood. The owner and employees have always been exceptionally friendly when I've been here. 

I haven't made my way through much of the menu because the nachos  ("Navidachos" because they have red and green Hatch chili sauce) are some of the best I've ever had. I'm usually not impressed by nachos...typically the first few chips are nice, but that's about it. Blue Adobe's nachos have excellent shredded beef in generous portions. A table of 4 could easily share the Navidachos, each have a bowl of soup and call it a meal.

I'm a big fan of the enchiladas here too. Seriously, though, I could put their Hatch chili sauce on anything and be a big fan of it.
