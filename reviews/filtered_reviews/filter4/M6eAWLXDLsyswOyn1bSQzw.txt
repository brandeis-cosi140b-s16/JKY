So, I just tried this place for the first time. 

I tried a chicken bowl. It's basically the same kind of menu as a Chipotle, you just build your meal as you go. I was pretty excited to try this place since they advertise that the chicken is Huli Huli chicken, which is a super flavorful kind of rotisserie chicken. 

I have to say, I was really impressed with the flavor of the chicken. It tasted pretty authentic to what I've had before, so that was awesome. 

I decided to get the rice with seaweed. Unfortunately, they don't offer white rice here, which, I guess is cool if you're trying to be healthy but I'm really not a fan of brown rice. The seaweed rice really has an overpowering taste of seaweed (pretty good in my opinion) but if you have an aversion to it I would avoid it. and stick to the regular rice. 

To top it off, I also got the pineapple verde salsa, guacamole, and cheese. 

These all had nice flavors, but flavors I felt could have been pumped up a little bit. The salsa was a bit of a let down, it had some occasional heat which was nice but I expected the taste to have a little more of a punch to it. 

All in all, the food is good. Definitely a place worth trying.
