Sundays are best for Mexican brunch with unlimited margarita drinks that poured even when your glass is 1/2 full. You can ask for blended versions as well. I was surprised as to how much tequila was in their margaritas since I thought they would be chintzy on the liquor, but boy was I wrong. Quite impressed with how quickly they refill your drinks though! Would definitely come back here again for Sunday brunch when I'm in the mood for decent Mexican food with endless margaritas.
