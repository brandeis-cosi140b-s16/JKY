The service was a little iffy. No water refills the entire time. The food was great though. Los Nachos were a great appetizer to share with the table. The Big Ass Burrito is probably the best burrito I have had, but it was a little heavy on the tortilla side. My first bite was only tortilla which was a disappointment. The rest of the burrito made up for it though. Only Mexican restaurant that I've ever been to that didn't serve chips and salsa.
