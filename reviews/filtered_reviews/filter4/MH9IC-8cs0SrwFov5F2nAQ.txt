I've been three times so far and have had a great experience each time. 

Awesome decor. The synthetic tree in the middle of the dining room (you'd never know it isn't real) just makes it along with the $1mln bar. 

The food is generally fantastic with a few items that are "only" very good and therefore just a couple of ticks below life changing. I'd strongly recommend the Miso glazed sea bass, the Pork Pad Thai and the Guacamole with crab. 

The service has always been excellent.

Value for the money is pretty stellar. Most menu items are under $20. 

The only thing I would change is how loud the dining room is. I love background music and high energy music in a social setting is cool too, but not so loud that I can't have a conversation. 

Bonus points to the ever-present McLarens, Ferraris, Aston Martins and Porsches parked out front. It's pure entertainment watching Scottsdale millionaires pull up in their Beemers and Benzes only to see the valet team treat their car like a run of the mill Toyota.
