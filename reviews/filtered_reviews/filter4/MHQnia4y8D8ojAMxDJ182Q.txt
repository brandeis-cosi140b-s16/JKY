We frequent Manuel's a couple of times a month. I think it warrants 3.5 stars but since we go often I'm going to bump it up rather than down.

I prefer sitting at the bar or "Cantina" area of Manuel's.  The couple of times we sat in the dining room the service was not really up to par.  Each time in the dining room, our server went missing and our food took a very long time.  Bad luck maybe... 

The food is usually pretty good and I am very critical of my mexican food!  My BF and I often share the fajitas for two.  We get a chicken/steak combo and request our veggies grilled with EVOO for a heart healthier version.  It's a ton of food and we each get our own side of beans, guac, sour, etc... I always have leftovers.  

A few times when I've felt indulgent, I've also enjoyed the Tres Amigos Enchiladas.  YUM! It's a enchilada trio (carne asada meat, chicken, spinach or cheese).  It's delicious.

I'm not really a fan of the Chicken Taco Salad.  I've only had it once and that was when I popped in for a quick lunch.  First, they serve the taco shell bowl on a very small plate so you can break the shell and mix up your salad.  That annoyed me and I had to request a larger plate.  On this visit, the chicken was dry and the guac was slightly brown.  It just didn't look appetizing at all.  I left hungry and $10 poorer.         

The salsa is also very fresh and flavorful.  They serve a "medium" and "hot" version.  I like to combine the two for a custom salsa.
