I had been to a Yelp event awhile back that had food from Three Amigos, so I knew before I came to the restaurant that they have good food.  So, recently when I dined in for the first time for Chad's suprise party, I discovered that they have good service here as well. 

This place is on the small side but popular and known for good food, so even on a weeknight, the place is busy. Still, even as busy as they were, our servers took really good care of us and really hustled. 

My favorites here included the Chicken Empanadas, chips & salsa, jalapeno salsa,   queso fundido, and churros.  I was not a big fan of their guacamole - too much onion for my taste. 

For my entree, I ordered the Enchiladas Poblanos - which consisted of 3 tortillas filled with chicken and  Mexican Mole Poblano sauce topped with cheese & sour cream.  This was served with beans & rice.  Sadly, the mole was not the most delicious that I have ever eaten, but it was ok.  I probably will order something different next time I am here.   I thought the rice was a bit on the bland side and I am not a huge fan of refried beans.  Next time I will probably skip these items.

I also tried a bite of the Chicken Enchiladas Verde. It had a bit too much onion for my taste, so I probably wouldn't order this dish here next time either. 

But, they have plenty of other options, so next time I visit, I will definitely check out some of their other offerings.   The prices are very reasonable here, our bill for 2 entrees was under $20 before tip.
