Best Mexican food in the valley for the money!  Location is in a not so good part of town but a lot of local police and fireman eat there during lunch time during the week.  The tortillas are made fresh and you end up wanted to take some home with you.  The red chili burro is very good and the rice and beans is so fresh it makes your mouth water thinking about it!  There is a line during the week so be prepared but the food is ready in no time.  Staff is very nice and friendly, food is hot and fresh, not too bad!
