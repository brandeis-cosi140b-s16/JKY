Wonderful food fresh and flavorful.  Watch out Chipotle this new kid on the block is going to give you a run for your money. The tortillas are made from scratch in front of you and you build your choice of street tacos or enchiladas or one of each.  They are in a building that once housed a dress shop so there is a surprise when your to go order is presented.  I recommend this.
