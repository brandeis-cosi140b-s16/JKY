The drinks here are really good, I mean really really good. It's not one tequila, two tequila floor. It's where you sit with your girl(s), boy(s) or girls and boys and enjoy the drinks. My faves: La Esposa (hibiscus and grapefruit, hello!), El Rey (citrus fiesta!) and Angelita (hibiscus and basil!!!). The food is good too. The guac, good and pork belly tacos, yummy. The place reminds me of the SoCal places that I used to frequent in my short stay there. I hear the owner is from San Diego. Well he did a good job with the place! 
One thing, the place is a little dark. I hear they have a patio, but in Pittsburgh, there are not many patio-friendly days, and I have never had such luck in the Cantina.
Also, they don't do reservations and the place is buuusy specially on Fri-Sat nights. And if you are thinking, oh not a big deal, I will call and do a take out, umm, good luck with that! Let me know if you can convince this restaurant to change its policy.
