A  few of my group decided to wander around and came across La Comida. We went in and sat at the bar for a drink. The Bartender was very friendly, I wish I could remember her name. And the rest of the staff was as well. She made our drinks and let us sample a tequila she really liked. We didn't have dinner so the only food I can review is the free chips/salsa. I like hot flavors. I usually order the hottest wings available when I go out for wings. But there was something about the salsa that didn't agree with me. It tasted good, but my mouth was on fire and my tongue hurt for about 2 days. No idea why lol. But if you're looking to get off the strip / Freemont wander down here, at least for a drink. It's a good time.
