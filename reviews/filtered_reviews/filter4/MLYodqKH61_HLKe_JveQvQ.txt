I first have to say the inside is very festive - so the name is very fitting.  There are a lot of good Mexican food restaurants in the west valley and many are really good as well.  I noticed this place a few weeks ago and decided to give it a try.  The rice and beans are very authentic.  The salsa is really good - somewhat spicier than I usually like but it didn't stop me from asking for more.  

What I love about this place is the overall atmosphere.  They have a wide range of entrees as well as deserts.  I also noticed the liquor shelf in the bar area and it is fully loaded with everything one could desire.  I would certainly recommend this for anyone that is looking for great Mexican food experience.  I have my favorite "Hole in the wall" that I go to often, but when I want a little change, this will be one of my top choices for sure.
