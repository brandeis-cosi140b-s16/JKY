I've been searching for a great mexican restaurant close to my office in old town that serves really good salsa for about 3 months now - finally found the place on Friday last week after I got over my brain-fart and decided to use Yelp! LOL

When you sit down and get your drink order, you get 2 flavors.  I only tried the regular salsa, as I knew I wasn't going to be too keen on the chili powder based salsa - never have been, it might have been fantastic, I just don't like chili/cayenne pepper based salsas.  The salsa I did try was fantastic, but it would of been nicer if we had little bowls to pour it in to instead of having to pour it on to plates.

I ordered up the #1 combination (I think it was #1).  Basically, it was a cheese enchilada, a beef taco, and a beef tamale (with rice and beans).  I had actually made a comment during my meal that the rice was the best rice I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant...no joke!

I'll definitely be going back over there many times over since I work within walking distance!
