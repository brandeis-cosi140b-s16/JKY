Cien Agaves is a very nice Mexican restaurant in old town scottsdale.   Margaritas were very good and refreshing on a hot summer day like yesterday and the food was delicious.   There were plenty of choices for vegetarians like me.  "Service with a smile" definitely made the experience an awesome one and will definitely go back again!!
