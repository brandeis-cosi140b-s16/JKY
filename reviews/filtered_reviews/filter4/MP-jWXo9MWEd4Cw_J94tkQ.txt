My favorite type of fusion food is no doubt Korean and Mexican! The bulgogi burrito (with added kimchi) at KoMex was tasty.  The burrito was tightly packed with ingredients evenly distributed. Each bite was very satisfying with a good amount of bulgogi, mexican rice, cilantro, onions, etc. Their hot sauce rack has a variety of hot sauce with different flavor and spiciness level which makes it very fun to try. 

We also tried the spam musubi and pork belly musubi. The musubi are on the thin side and with less rice than the ones I usually have. Nothing too special about these two. The complimentary chips, salsa and guacamole was very nice. And service was attentive and friendly. I'd be back!
