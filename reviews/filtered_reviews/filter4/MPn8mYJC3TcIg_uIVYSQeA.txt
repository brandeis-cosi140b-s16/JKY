Been here twice now and both times were really good.
Service has been very good both times and they have a nice outdoor patio area.
Chips and homemade salsa are a great way to start.

The corn chowder is great as a lunch alone or just a cup with something else from the menu. Our table tried a variety of menu items and everyone enjoyed their meal.

Will definitely go back again.
