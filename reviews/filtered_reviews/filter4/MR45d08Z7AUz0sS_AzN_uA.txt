Phenomenal service from the staff and general Manager, who personally made the fresh guacamole for us, yum! Everything we ordered from carnitas to Ahi tuna was delectable, fresh and fantastic! And the Margaritas are great!!! We happen to be there on a night that they had a live band and that was a real treat. Drink + danced the nite away. We'll definitely be back for another girls night out!!!!! Ole!
