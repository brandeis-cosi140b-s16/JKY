This is a classic Mexican chain restaurant and they are consistently delicious. We each had a different margarita and we all tasted the others. They were all good. I had the cucumber margarita which was really light, less sugar, and very tasty. We each had two individual bowls of salsa with chips as an appetizer. Yum! For dinner I had the roasted poblano chili. It wasn't too heavy, nor to light. I really enjoyed it. My husband had the steak fajitas and he likes them well done. The seasoning was perfect. Our other friend had the Baja Burro, which looked delicious. This isn't a need an upscale five star Mexican Cantina, but a great neighborhood Mexican restaurant. The price was right. The service was friendly, reliable and at a reasonable pace. I will definitely be back.
