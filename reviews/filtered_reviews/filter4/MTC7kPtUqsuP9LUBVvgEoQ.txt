1st time here in a few years. Had a great experience. Our table had tacos, burrito, and a torta w/ fries. The carne asada and fish were great. Friendly staff, good beer selection, and good prices. Excited to come back here on a weeknight for festivities. 
PS A lot of tables had a side order of beans, so they must be great!
