The food was pretty good - we had the pit-roasted birria (goat) which was delicious, the sampler (taquitos, empanadas, and 3-layer dip) which was decent, a side of black beans, and chips and salsa with a bunch of different flavored salts and mild, medium, and spicy salsas.  The salsas were excellent!

The service was good - the staff was very friendly and helpful.  It was a little pricey, I thought - but this is Vegas, and most restaurants - even the crappy ones - are overpriced.

The decor was kind of annoying.  I love the color red, but the place was pretty much solid red.  The walls, the booths.  Everything red.  It was too much for me.  That said, I'd still return for the tasty food.
