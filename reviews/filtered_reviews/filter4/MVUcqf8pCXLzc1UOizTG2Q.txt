My party of 5 dined at barrio on a Wednesday night and had a nice dinner, including a fantastic order of guac.  The restaurant was very busy, so we had our well below average tasting margaritas on the front patio.  The 45 minute wait would have been easier to take had we received our guac and chips in a reasonable amount of time.  The bartender forgot about the order, so we didnt get them until we were seated for dinner, about 45 minutes after ordering them.  Our service once we were seated at our table was very good. Our server offered many good suggestions and the meal came quickly.  Overall, we enjoyed our evening and were pleased with dinner. The main issue was with the bar -- the solo bartender was very busy, so I suppose there was some justification for the poor service and poorly made drinks.
