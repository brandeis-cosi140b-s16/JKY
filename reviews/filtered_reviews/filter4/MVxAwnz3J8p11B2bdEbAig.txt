I was craving Mexican food the day before Cinco de Mayo and yelped a few places in my zip code. Found this place- I have been here before but only for a few drinks. Walked in and instantly was feeling the vibe of the place by their band playing some Santana. Got me in the mood for good food and ambiance. Started off with a margarita and it did not disappoint little tart and just right. As an app we started off with a 1/2 order of guac which was perfect for just the 2 of us and the queso dip, which was tasty but had chorizo on top (I don't eat meat). It was mentioned on the menu but I guess I over looked that part. Service was prompt and friendly, and we we're really enjoying the live music. I ordered the lazy enchiladas which were soooo good. It came with beans and some really flavorful rice that was so delish. The enchiladas came with a verde salsa that was really good also. By the time I finished my 1st one I was so full from my whole meal. Over all I really enjoyed my meal from start to finish. Our bill was around $50 for 2 alcoholic drinks 2 apps and 2 entrees. Seemed just perfect to me. I will def be back!!
