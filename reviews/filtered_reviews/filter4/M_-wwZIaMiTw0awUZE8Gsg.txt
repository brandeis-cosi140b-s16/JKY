Solid, safe, somewhat gringoey Mexican fare... but decent indeed.

I have been coming here for years and usually have a good experience.

We usually hit the Cantina because they have a killer happy hour and lots of TVs with the games on. Lots of nibbles under $5 and cheap beer and well drinks. 

Salsa is tasty but absolutely no heat. Even their "hot" sauce doesn't have heat. 

My favorite items are the spinach enchiladas ($8 on Wednesdays) and the Mexican pizza ($5 on happy hour).

My husband likes their green chili pork, mini tacos, and the chicken tenders basket ( which drives me crazy that he orders American food in a Mexican restaurant). 

Service is usually good but they can get very busy. I think they have one busser for the whole restaurant so sometimes it can take awhile to get dishes cleared or chips and salsa refills. Happy hour seating can be a war zone with crazies ready to kill each other over tables... luckily they started a happy hour wait list in the bar to prevent bloodshed.

I recommend Valle Luna as a place to take out of towners or people scared of Mexican food or spicy food. It is a nice, safe introduction to Mexican food. Or they can commit sacrilege like my husband and order chicken fingers or a burger...
