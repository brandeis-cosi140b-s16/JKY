Ventured there last thursday night for a quick bite.  I sat at the bar and was greeted by both bartenders.  They seemed out of place, like they should be working at a smokey dive bar instead of a hip taco joint, but they gave me a basket of free chips so i was happy.  I ordered the flank steak taco and the shrimp taco.   The flank steak was juicy, full of flavor and cooked perfectly.   The mushroom mixture inside the taco was a nice compliment to the meat.  The shrimp taco was advertised as spicy and for once , at a restaurant, the advertisment lived up to reality.   It didnt burn my mouth off but it caught my attention.  The cilantro and citrus flavors made this a predictable tasting taco, but it still was enjoyable

 Both tacos, chips and a beer ran me about $14.  I look forward to going back and trying more of the tacos, ceviches, and soups this winter.  The menu is limited so make sure your friends check out the website so they can see if there is something for them.
