Got here on a Friday evening expecting a long wait but got here a bit early before the nite rush so we got seated right away. Bonus!  The waiter was courteous and our food came quickly. Double Bonus!  The food was delicious and exactly what we expected, actually a little better than expected because the jambalaya that was previously too  spicy was perfectly seasoned. Jackpot!  We would definitely come again even if we had to wait longer to be seated.
