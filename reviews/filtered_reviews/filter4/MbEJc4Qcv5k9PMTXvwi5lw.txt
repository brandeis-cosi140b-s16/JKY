Whenever my wife and I go to a new city we like to try a couple of Guy Fieri's Diners Drive Ins and Dives.  

We came here yesterday after arriving in Charlotte.  After taking our drink order we were given chips and salsa. It was a different salsa,  sweet corn,tomato and jalape√±o which we enjoyed.

For the entrees the Mrs. had the Carne Asada tacos and I had the Tavarua Wahoo tacos (tuna was substituted for the wahoo). As our normal procedure we always share our order.  The wahoo had a bit of a kick from the honey wasabi sauce.  The Carne Asada was tender and milder with a roasted tomato sauce. 

This is a definitely a divey place,  with eclectic artwork from local artists on the walls. They also serve local craft beers which I didn't have an opportunity to try. Maybe next time when I am in town. :)
