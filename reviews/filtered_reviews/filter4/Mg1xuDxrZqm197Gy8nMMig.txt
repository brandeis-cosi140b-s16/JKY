Phat Burrito is one of those places that helps Charlotte's identity as a city, a nice quirky counterpoint to the banks and chain joints uptown and in the various malls at the peripheries of the city.

I think people have already covered the food angle pretty well in the other reviews.  The tacos, burritos, and quesadillas all share the same basic building blocks, and the dishes benefit from fresh ingredients of good quality.  I've never been disappointed.  

The service is pretty much no-frills counter service, but it is easy to deal with and fast.

My favorite part, though, is the salsa bar.  They make some dynamite salsa over at Phat, and it's cool to alternate between the hot, medium, verde, etc. as you plow through your burrito.

nice work.
