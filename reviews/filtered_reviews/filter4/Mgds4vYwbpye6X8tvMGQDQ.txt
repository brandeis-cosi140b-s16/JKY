Wanting a quick meal for lunch and craving a little Mexican my friend and I thought we would check out this cool joint.

Nice wood doors when you walk in, don't be fooled it isn't closed!

This business is a pretty clean establishment, with a Mexican Mayan decor.

The food was well cooked with speedy service. I won't tell you what I got because well I don't know, I like the surprise! Wait maybe it was the chicken enchiladas, yep it was!!!!

They also have high chairs and the staff were great with my son. Offering food that he might like we also a plus.

Overall not a bad little place. Good service and great food
