Go for lunch. 

My folks live here, I live at Arribas. This place is delcious. Two item lunch combo and a tall drink makes for a great day with family and friends. Take your parents here, take a date here food is always cooked excellently, always busy, friendly, and great. 

Never have had issues eating here. Sometimes take out would mess up which you just have to make sure when you go for pick up to double check, they are busy. 

All and all the food is always good, I like the shredded beef tacos, the chicken chimichangas, Flautas, Dos XX or dare I say Margaritas in small punch bowels that will make you happy. 

If you haven't tried swing by, if you have visit sometime.
