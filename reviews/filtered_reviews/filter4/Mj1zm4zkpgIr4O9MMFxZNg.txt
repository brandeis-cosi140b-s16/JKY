Three of us arrived for dinner at Casa Ramos in Mesa three days before Christmas. Altough staying in North Scottsdale 23 miles away the great reviews on Yelp inspired us to make the trip.

The building and decor is nothing out of the ordinary but the food is another matter. Our entree portions were plentiful and included a beef burrito, Camarones Al Mojo {a shrimp and mushroom dish with garlic butter sauce}, and Talpiquena, a very tasty carne asada beef with shrimp, garlic butter, mushrooms and cheese. All served with tortillas, and excellent rice and refried beans.

An extensive list of  beer and other beverages complete the package. Our server Marsha was very bubbly and attentive. Our next trip to the Valley of the Sun will include dinner at Casa Ramos.
