The tortilla chips with the queso chipotle dip is very flavorful and delicious.  I had the chicken and spinach enchilada which was only so so due to the chicken being dry.

The dessert ibarra mexican chocolate creme brûlée was very rich creamy chocolate which I absolutely loved.  

I had the day's special margarita and I can't remember the name or what exactly was in it other than it had malibu rum in it.  I don't usually like malibu, but the mix of liquor was just right and probably the highlight of the evening.  

The meal was a dinner on a week night and the atmosphere was that of a nightclub with the lighting dimmed and the music blaring.  The waiter was very attentive and the service was great as well.
