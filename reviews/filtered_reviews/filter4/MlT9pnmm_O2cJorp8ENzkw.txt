I have been going here for many years now. The food is always good and you always leave full. The tostada is so big I can barley get my mouth over it to take a bite. The shredded beef tacos are great. I also love the flautas and the chicken fajita chimi. The chimi's here are huge! The beans and rice are great to. So many mexican food restaurants have rice that's tasteless, which is funny cause it comes with every plate they serve. You would think they would put some flavor in that rice, but here they do. Always a good meal and I would recommend it for sure.
