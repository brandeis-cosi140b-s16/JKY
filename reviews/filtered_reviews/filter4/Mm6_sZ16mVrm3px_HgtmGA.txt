There is nothing better when you are hungover than chips, salsa, and queso. And a giant Coke. And a nap afterwards. 

This isn't your typical Mexican joint. The decor is wacky. They sell hysterical t-shirts. The place is massive. I'm pretty sure you could play an endless game of hide and seek here. 

The chips are light, the salsa has a kick to it. They have a ton of different sauce options here. I really like the queso. Menu wise, I think I get something different each visit based on what I'm craving. I'm a big fan of the Classic Tex-Mex enchiladas. I mean, how can you go wrong with something covered in chili and cheese? Chuy's also does daily specials and has different drink deals each week night. 

I've always had great service and everyone is so nice here. It's hard not to smile when you're here. It's just a fun and happy place.
