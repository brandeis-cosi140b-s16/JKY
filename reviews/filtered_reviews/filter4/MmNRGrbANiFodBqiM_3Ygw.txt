A small little dive with incredible food!  Mexican and American dishes with Korean flair.  When you walk in your expectations are not high, Michael Jackson's Thriller playing in background, older tv in corner with ESPN on...open kitchen with small seating area, typical of an older strip mall layout.
You are greeted at door by cook and staff, and service starts as soon as you sit down, Chips with salsa and guacamole served with drinks. and food is prepared to order and fast. Many higher end restaurants could take a tip from these folks.
We had Sliders with Korean BBQ meat and asian slaw, Masubi (spam, egg and rice roll)
and Bulgogi nachos. All were delicious and would be considered high end tapas at double the price in a large trendy place.
Serving sizes large, prices very reasonable for quality.
