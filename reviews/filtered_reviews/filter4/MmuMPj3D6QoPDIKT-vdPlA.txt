Mmmmmm what a fun and authentic Mexican restaurant. This type of food is always our go to choice when going our to dinner, so why not try every different place? I just love the decor and atmosphere here. My husband and I ordered the guacamole dip and since it was sooo stinkin hot and we were at a late lunch early dinner time of the day we shared the steak fajitas. It was more than enough food for us to split and they could have rolled us out the door we were so stuffed! The steak was super tender, the veggies were fresh and most importantly for Arizona summers, the a/c was crankin Great place, we will definitely return!
