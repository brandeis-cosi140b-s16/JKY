Jalapenos has been our go to Mexican joint since the late 1900's. Many restaurants have come and gone in this neighborhood, Jalapenos has staying power. The staff are all very friendly and helpful, and our glasses are always full! The owner/manager usually stops by our table at the end of our meal to make sure everything was good, and it always is!

The chips and salsa are amazing! What sets them apart is that the chips are a combination of both corn chips and flour chips. Not just the standard corn chips like in most Mexican restaurants. The salsa is fresh and delish with the perfect amount of cilantro.

I think between my husband and I, we have ordered just about everything on the menu and it has all been very good. Also, if for some crazy reason you find yourself there and don't feel like Mexican food, the Jalapeño burger is fantastic. If you have room for desert, try the Flan! It is absolutely the best flan I have ever had, anywhere! It has a lovely smooth creamy consistency, simply perfect!

I highly recommend Jalapeños as a great Mexican family restaurant.
