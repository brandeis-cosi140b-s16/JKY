This place is sooooo cute! The waitresses are dressed in tank tops and short as a uniform. If I was looking for a job, this would be my ideal place to work. I don't mind running around all day in shorts and flip flops. Besides the cuteness of this place, the food was also good! I had the enchilada del mar (talapia, lump crab, shrimp). YUMMY!!!
