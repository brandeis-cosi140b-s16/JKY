We were very excited to try the new barrio queen in our neighborhood. We got there and it was about a 20 minute wait, but they offered to text us when our table was ready.  When we did finally get our table, we sat outside but it wasn't uncomfortable due to the misters. We ordered the guacamole, tacos, chiliquiles, and drinks. Everything was very good and our server was excellent!
