What can I say? Lobster Tacos. Mmmm. 

Three tacos, with huge chunks of lobster meat, perfectly placed in their taco holder. How awesome is that? I've never seen a place that serves tacos in a taco holder. This comes out perfectly with no mess. 

They have TVs for watching the game, and obviously it is not Vegas without a bar. 

They serve complimentary chips and dip, and you can ask for refills if you want.
