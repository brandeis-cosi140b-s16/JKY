Ate here last Sunday for AYCE/D brunch. 

The ambiance was nice, the staff attentive and the margaritas and mimosas were flowing for those that wanted them (and they didn't go light on the alcohol in those drinks either)!

I enjoyed the variety and freshness of what they had out for the taking, which not only included some Michoacan flavored Mexican dishes, but a couple main stay brunch items such as bacon and sausage.  The shrimp cerviche stood out as memorable, as did a tender beef dish I do recall the name of. Actually, everything I sampled tasted very good.

If you want any of their freshly made tortillas (corn or flour) you have to ask your waiter / waitress for them. A couple at our table bitched about this, but after I explained that if they left them out at the buffet line they would either end up dried out or soggy, depending on how they were left out, they understood and enjoyed them fresh off the grill.

Although the staff sport their "gringo" shirts I was not offended (takes a lot to offend this white boy), but it could others:

gringo  (r) 
-- n  , pl -gos
 a person from an English-speaking country: used as a derogatory term by Latin Americans  


We would eat here again, should any future stay in Vegas accommodate the detour.
