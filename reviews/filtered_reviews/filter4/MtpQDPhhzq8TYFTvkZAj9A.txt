This place didn't get 5 stars because of the salsas...they're not hot enough or tasty enough for me, the best one of is the green salsa, spicier and a little more flavorful than the red.  
          Some of the best tacos I've had in a long time.  I had the cabeza, carne asada tacos, and a half cabeza/half carne asada order of $10 fries! Yes, their fries as $10!! 
     I thought that the cabeza tacos were better, the meat very soft and a little slimy? typical of this type of meat, seasoned to perfection.  I don't konw if it was my particular batch of carne asada, but it was way too salty.  The tortillas are made of yellow corn, and are delicious.  They add avocado to their carne asada tacos, but not to the cabeza, apparently this is "tijuana style".  You also get a side of grilled onions and yellow peppers, they are delicious with the tacos.  Their order of fries are quite large and they are generous with the meat, however I didn't think they were worth the $10. They add avocado, cheese and cream to the fries, I uploaded a photo of these. 
    Their customer service is great, they are all very nice, the cooks and the cashiers.  They knew that it was my first time there, and they were very helpful in helping me decide what to order.  
     I was pleased to see that about 20 min into my delicious meal, the place started getting packed, which is a good indicator of freshness and quality.  You get your order pretty fast.  I would definately recommend this place.  
      The place looks very clean.
