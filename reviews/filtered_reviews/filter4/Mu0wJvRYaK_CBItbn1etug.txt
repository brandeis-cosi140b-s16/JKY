A rating on Yelp is just an average, and after 300 plus reviews I think 2&1/2 stars is a little harsh.  After Yelp filters some reviews its up to us to decipher  the reviews that are left.  I've noticed several bad reviews recently for Cabo Wabo's & I must say I am surprised.  

We arrived on a Thursday night & knew we would probably have to kill some time drinking while we waited for a seat, tough life I know.  We were pleasantly surprised when we were sat immediately at the outdoor bar over looking the strip with a clear view of the fountains shooting off across the street @ Bellagio.  When the wind blew just right we could feel  the mist from the fountains, which felt so good in the dry Vegas heat.  Cabo Wabo's was crazy packed but the bar back grabbed us some menus & took initiative getting us our first round of drinks (frozen margaritas & red bull vodkas) while we waited for our server to machete her way threw the weeds she was knee deep in.  It was a gorgeous night to catch up with my Pops & his wife who live here in Las Vegas & we could not have had a better time.   

I can't stress enough how if you go into a restaurant with a chip on your shoulder anticipating bad service your gonna have a shitty experience.  You live in and or you are visiting a great city to party and have fun.   Raise your glass, have a drink, do a shot.... and chill out!  I thought the the food came out in a reasonable time and had no complaints with my service.   The guacamole & chips were money, the chicken chimichangas were as good as it gets (especially after kicking back several margaritas).   I thought my fish tacos with beans & rice were the bomb & devoured every bite.   I was so happy I got my dad to to eat some Mexican fare that night it could not have gotten any better.  This was one bill I had no problem picking up & we will be back on our next visit to Las Vegas.

I know the reviews are mixed but I would roll the dice & check it out!
