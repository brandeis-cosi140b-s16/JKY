Hell Yeah, Real Tacos!  If you have ever heard somebody talk about "Real Tacos" this is what they mean.  I cannot say what exactly qualifies as a real taco, but there are subtle differences from a real taco & the kind you find at most Americanized/Taco Bell type places. First of all, you know you're at a real taco place when you walk in & the place is full of landscapers having lunch.  Next, the tortillas were small and doubled-up.  Then the selection of meats was really authentic: buche (beef neck meat), cabeza (beef cheeks), lengua (beef tongue), al pastor (marinated pork), carnitas (braised pork),and  finally the carne asada was actually flame cooked, not cooked on a flat grill.  The tacos are then topped with cilantro & onions.

I tried one of each kind of taco and they were all greasy and full of flavor.  This was my first time there.  I plan to go back and try the tortas and maybe even the burritos because those looked really tasty.

Oh, the icing on the cake was the price... $1.25/taco.  That's keeping it real.
