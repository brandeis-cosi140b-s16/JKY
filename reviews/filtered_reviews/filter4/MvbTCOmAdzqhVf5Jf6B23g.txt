Okay, so let's start off by saying I tried these guys off balance and out of their location at the AZ Taco Fest on 10/18. The tequila pork and the chicken taco they put up were IMO, the best ones I had all day. I spent some time chatting with one of the reps at the tent about the food and how they do things and was pretty enthused about house made salsa, seeing as how everyone has their own version. The tequila menu would be a big draw for those looking to step out of the Patron/Cuervo repertoire, but I like that they now offer a special where if you buy a regular entree, you get a penny Margarita! I am looking forward to visiting the home location and seeing just how they stack up against my taco testing to urge zones when they have a full kitchen.
