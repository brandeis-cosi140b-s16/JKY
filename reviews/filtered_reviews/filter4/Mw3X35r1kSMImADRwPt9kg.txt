So, we ate here a few months ago and I don't recall exactly what we had.  There were three vegetarians and so that narrows down the list for you.  Overall, I think we all thought the food was pretty good.  I personally really enjoyed my cocktail.  The decor and vibe were great.  I would come here again, though perhaps it wouldn't make my top 10 list.
