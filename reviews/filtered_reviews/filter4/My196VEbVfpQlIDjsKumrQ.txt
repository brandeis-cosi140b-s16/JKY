Phat Burrito's burritos are just that: Phat. And, depending on how you order them, they're Fat too. And really, there's no reason to order anything else. 

Choose from BBQ Chicken, Steak, Chicken, Fish and Grilled Veggies (the girlfriend's pick every time). Surprisingly, the fish is excellent--and at a really good value. It's like a blackened Tilapia and comes with a pineapple-y salsa. Extremely tasty. Everything else is good as well--and you can add beans (black, spicy red or refried) for no additional cost. Go with the spicy red; you won't be disappointed. The guacamole isnt anything special, but it's fresh and tasty, so throw that on your burrito as well. 

Grab a Modelo as your cerveza and you're all set to enjoy the funky decor of the spare inside. Outside seating is perfect for a warm evening, and there's often a mellow hipster crowd out there enjoying itself. 

Life is Phat.
