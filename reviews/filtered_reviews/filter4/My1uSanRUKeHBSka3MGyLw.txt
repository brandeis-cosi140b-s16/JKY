I used online ordering to get some albondigas soup last night. My son picked it up for me and it was wonderful! The broth was that perfect mix of beefy tomatoey goodness. I put some extra lime juice in and felt much better. 

It would have been nice though if you could order chips and salsa off the to go menu ala carte.
