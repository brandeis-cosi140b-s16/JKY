They serve brunch until 3 pm which is an hour later than most brunch places, nice for us late risers. I had a delicious veggie burrito with nopales and lots of other yummy veggies. This item was on the torta list but it can be made into a burrito instead. Our water glasses were always full which is a must for me. 

We had a fruit plate that was piled with watermelon, honey dew, strawberries, black berries and jicama. It was elevated though as they were all covered in quinoa. Yum. 

There was a multi piece jazz band playing while we ate on the patio and it was very enjoyable. 

The only reason they get a 4 is because their guacamole was inedibly salty.
