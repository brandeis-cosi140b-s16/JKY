Today at lunch I had the chicken tostada and it was great. I got it this green tomatillo ranch that was great. This place is a great spot for tacos, burritos, and enchiladas. The only knock I had was that it seems they are a little skimpy on the meat and heavy on the beans.  They make their tortillas from scratch in 3 varieties. For dessert I also got this amazing coconut caramel flan I totally recommend it if your a coconut fan. 

 If you haven't been here yet make the trip it's worth it.
