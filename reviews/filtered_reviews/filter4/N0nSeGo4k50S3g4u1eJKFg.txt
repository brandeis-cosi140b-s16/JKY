I very much enjoyed it. Of course we had to wait, but it was worth it. Our drinks were delicious. The frozen guava margarita was very refreshing on a hot summer evening. Also the bomba was tasty and strong.

the bread and olive spread is different, I love olives so I loved it. The guac is pretty much what it's cracked up to be. A bit too chunky for my liking, but no big. 

I ordered the pollo poblano and it was delicious.. that sauce was amazing. The babe got the pork tacos. I only got one little baby bite, so you know they must have been tasty.

They also had a duo playing music, so that was cool.
