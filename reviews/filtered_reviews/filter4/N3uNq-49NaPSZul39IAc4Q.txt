From the outside, it just looks like another strip mall eatery....inside it's very cute and cozy.  The margaritas, tortilla soup and fried ice cream was great!  After reading reviews about the other location and hearing about Sweet Potato Enchiladas, I had to try them.  I made my friend order them (haha) and they were definitely different...but good.  The prices were reasonable and the service was great.
