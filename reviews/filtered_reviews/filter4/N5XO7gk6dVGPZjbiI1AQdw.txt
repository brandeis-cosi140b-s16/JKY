Super stoked to try this place - but 

When you walk in this place, it's got a really good vibe, skate gear and logos splattered from wall to wall and has a real open floor plan. The problem is that you aren't sure whether to sit down or find somewhere to place an order. If you walk to the right, you'll find the bar, and this is actually where you place your order - it's quite odd. The menu is pretty clear, and hangs on the wall. Kacie was definitely rude. I asked her what was in draft. She huffed and said "blah blah blah Sam Adams" I asked which Sam Adams and she replied with "Uh...the regular one." Service fail, Kacie.

The food was fantastic. I got the fish tacos and the husband got the shrimp tacos, we traded plates after eating one of each so we could share. Holy Moses! They were fantastic! I liked the fish better, but I had the shrimp second, so maybe that's why the tortilla was falling apart so much. It ended up being a big mess in my hand (that's what she said?). The Maui beer battered onion rings were an 'oh wow' situation. Absolutely delicious and came with ketchup and ranch. 

We'll absolutely be back for more. They're open until 2am, so a perfect spot for a late-night nosh. 

...hopefully Kacie won't be there.
