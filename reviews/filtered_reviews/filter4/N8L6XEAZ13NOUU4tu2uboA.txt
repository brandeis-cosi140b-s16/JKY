Blue Adobe is a little blue sapphire in the rough! 

The service was prompt and courteous.  The complementary chips and salsa were yummy....but I wish they had a hot salsa option. I went for lunch, and had the portobello mushroom enchalada with rice and beans.  The enchalada was very rich with Adobe cream sauce and cheese. It had a very unique flavor....oddly familiar. I couldn't pin point it until I asked. It was ameretto. Ahhh!! That's it! The ameretto added a distinct flavor, but I think it was almost overpowering. Just a tad less would've been nice! The rice and (pinto) beans were flavored to perfection! 

The New Mexican cuisine was a delight!  Enjoy!
