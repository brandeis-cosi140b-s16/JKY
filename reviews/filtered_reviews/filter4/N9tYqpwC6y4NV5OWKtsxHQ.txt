Tacos El Gordo is a local institution. This place is awesome. They have street tacos for $2 each.

You stand in different meat lines and order the meat how you want: in tacos, in mulas, over fries, ect. There are many street taco places in Las Vegas but this place has it down to a science.

I recommend the adobada aka spicy pork, the lengua, and the tripas aka tripe. Mulas are like small quesadillas. You can't go wrong with street tacos though. 

My suggestion is to get the grilled green onions to eat with a side of salsa.
