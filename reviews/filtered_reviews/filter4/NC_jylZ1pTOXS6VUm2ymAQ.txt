Saw Los Reyes de la Torta featured on Man vs. Food, and had to check it out. 

I ordered the massive Torta Del Ray and wasn't disappointed. It wasn't the best sandwich I've ever had, or even the best torta, but it was definitely above average.

The Torta Del Ray was packed with ingredients and flavor. It had egg, chorizo, hot dog, ham, beans, beef, pork, tomato, and avocado. It was such a large sandwich, it was hard to eat.  

Although it was a massive amount of food, I finished the entire sandwich because it was so good. 

The restaurant had an authentic feel to it as well, which enhanced the eating experience.
