Great place to go with your friends! Had a frozen raspberry big azz marg which was excellent. My friend and I split the nachos which was a good idea-- the portion was huge. The only downside of this place is the size, had to wait forty minutes for a table for four. Always crowded on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. Ambiance is nice, but get here early if you want a table!
