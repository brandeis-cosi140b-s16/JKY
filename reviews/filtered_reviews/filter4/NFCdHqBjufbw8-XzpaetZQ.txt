Crescent is one of my favorite places to drop into for all kinds of reasons.... particularly Saturday night dance parties. 

Sure it may be a little hip, but to be honest, I think this is exactly the type of thing downtown Phoenix needs more of. It's a great place to grab a drink, catch a show, dance your pants off, meet new people, and generally have a great time without the bougie atmosphere other areas of the valley may offer.

By all means, if you like whiskey and ginger beer - get yourself a HONEY BADGER. They're on happy hour and are generally delicious.

MAJOR PROPS to the CB for expanding their patio areas as well. Most businesses aren't as proactive with stuff like that and would rather just keep a line waiting outside. Last time I was there, the added space was much appreciated.
