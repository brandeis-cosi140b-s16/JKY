I've been through the drive-thru twice now.  The first time I ever went was on my way home from work, late at night, searching for something that was open and conveniently on the way.  It seemed so unassuming and I never had even considered stopping before- now I'm so glad that I have!
The first time through I got The Standard, no cheese, no alterations and a side of fries. I don't know if it was hunger but I swore that was the best burger and fries I've had in ages. The fries were super hot, crispy and seasoned in the yummiest mixture of spices. SO GOOD.
I was craving it again and went through, this time around noon but my experience wasn't as great. I added jalape√±os and grilled onions to The Standard, ordered the fries and a side of stand sauce. This time it cost me around $10 total because of all of the additions and I don't think it was really worth it. The fries were a little soggy and not as generously seasoned as the previous time and the burger was a little greasier and messier to eat. The stand sauce cost extra and it wasn't anything to die for, though it was good. Next time I'll stick to the regular and hope for crispier fries...and get a shake I've been hearing raves about!
