This is my go to place for a solid margarita night. Love their chicken quesadillas and the fajitas are good too. Go during happy hour, such good deals. The service is great, and all of the food is awesome. Only thing on the menu I don't like is the cheese crisp, it's like a weird version of a Mexican pizza or something, pass on that.
