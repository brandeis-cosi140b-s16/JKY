I have to agree with Rand H., this Carolina's is far superior to the one at 12th St. & Mojave.  It's well kept inside and most times that I have visited this location it is pretty clean. I have been there times when there are dirty tables, but when the line of people ordering never stops you have to go easy on them. 

Either  way the food is worth the wait. The machaca tacos are my favorite along with the standard bean and cheese burritos. I love that you can load up on as much salsa as you want.  The breakfast burritos are great (try the four way: egg, potato, bean, cheese). 

It is cheap and fast (even with said lines) and the tortillas rock. I always buy a dozen to take home and them heat them in a skillet before serving. YUM!
