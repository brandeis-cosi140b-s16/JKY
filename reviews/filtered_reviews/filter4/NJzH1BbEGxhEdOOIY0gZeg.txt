I have always had a pleasant dining experience at Nacho Daddy.  The nachos are good and are served in huge portions.  I usually order a Sonoran Dog and skip the nachos though.  Service has always been attentive and fast.  Not a huge menu to choose from but if you are craving nachos certainly a decent place to stop in.  They have happy hour specials and are a great place to watch football.  Stop in when they offer trivia and you and your friends are sure to have fun.
