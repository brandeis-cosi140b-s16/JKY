I had the chicken fajita burrito bowl for lunch here yesterday and it was fabulous.  They had several tables out on their patio so I was able to enjoy the sunshine.  My food wasn't quite what I expected, I asked for medium salsa and I didn't find it spicy in the least.  I was also surprised that their rice actually tasted creamy, more like risotto than anything that I've had in mexican food before.  In any case, I really liked it and was sad when I wasn't able to finish the whole thing.  An employee quickly got me a to-go box but unfortunately it didn't really heat up well today.  This would definitely become a staple in my lunchtime rotation if I lived in Phoenix!
