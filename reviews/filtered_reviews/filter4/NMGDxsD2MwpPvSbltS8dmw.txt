Tex Tubbs offers a fun atmosphere and a creative menu. If you're looking for authentic, look again. The key to satisfaction here is ordering the funkier items that put a spin on more classic TexMex dishes.

For example, the southern inspired fried chicken tacos are awesome. The flavors go so well together. The unique burrito bowls are also super tasty. However, I wasn't as thrilled with my steak taco. Wasn't bad, but didn't blow my mind. 

While the wait was long, the service ended up being fantastic! Our awesome waitress did an amazing job with our large group. Highly recommend celebrating a birthday here. You can grab drinks at One Barrel while you wait for a table.
