It's been a couple of years since we've been here and we wanted to do something different.  Dinner comes with fideo soup, rice, beans, and choice of corn or flour tortillas.

My wife had the chicken Celestina, a chicken breast with black and green olives, and almond slices cooked in garlic, lime and wine.  I had the chicken Rebeca, also a chicken breast but with cooked with fresh cactus strips, onions, cilantro, and cubed tomatoes with a bit of chopped jalape√±o.  

We both enjoyed our dishes.  I was surprised that my wife liked the almond in her dish.  She's generally been averse to such additions to food.  Imagine my surprise!  I enjoyed the cactus with my chicken.  Both dishes had good flavors of fresh ingredients.

For dessert, we had their chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.  It was more than enough for two people. The cake was a round shaped and was filled with a liquid chocolate and was much like a lava cake.  The ice cream had caramel drizzled on top.

I'm not sure why we don't come here more often.  It's close to home and it's very good.  Service was excellent!
