Upon suggestion of the "Scottsdale Native," I landed here one night for dinner. This place is part of Fox Restaurant Concepts group who is also responsible for Culinary Dropout, Wildflower, Modern Steak, Zin Burger, Sauce, Montana Avenue, Bloom among others. 
ATMOSPHERE: Awesome. Very happening, trendy with mostly young professional and older folks. Huge place with big open space. Great for groups with long table seating either booth or traditional table or couch. The wall opens up to the outdoor patio where you can sit on couches.  We sat inside since it was a bit chilly.
FOOD: Latin/Mexican inspired menu. Huge portions!
1. Complimentary chips/salsa - didn't have any chips as I like to usually eat my salsa by spoon since it's lower calorie that way. Good flavor, nothing spectacular. Wish it were a bit more chunkier. 
2. Fish tacos - the Native and I split this dish and it was brought out split for us. It was like 2 entrees! I'm glad we split this since it was a ton of food. The dish came with rice, pinto beans (choice of black beans as well). Mini fish tacos (4) with grilled fish, avocado, pico de gallo. Very yummy. Always a fan of the grilled food even though it increases your colon cancer risk. 
3. Crab and shrimp ceviche - containing cucumber, avocado, radish. Nice flavors. Not memorable however so there not much to write here..... simply because I can't remember..... I know it wasn't bad though.
SERVICE: No complaints here. Attentive enough.
PARKING: Private lot. No problems finding a spot.
CONCLUSION: I think I would come here again more for the atmosphere but food is good too!
