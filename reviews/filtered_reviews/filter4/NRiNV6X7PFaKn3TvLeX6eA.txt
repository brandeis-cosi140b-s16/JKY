I never have high expectations for places in Vegas but this one is pretty good. Decent price, good food, kinda reminds me of Pink Tacos (for all you LA ppl) It's located inside of Planet Hollywood

Came here to get a "snack" which turned into a full on meal. The fajitas are pretty good. There's about 6 thin strips and they give you all the goods to put into your fajita: sour cream, guac, beans, rice, etc. 

The guacamole fresca is pretty damn good. They make it in front of you and it's just basically guac and chips. 

I don't know, I thought this place was pretty good but I was also starving so at that point, I think anything is really good. 

But I do recommend this place if you just want an afternoon snack or don't feel like splurging on the fancy restaurants
