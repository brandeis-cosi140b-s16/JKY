Wait time was a lot longer than we were told, but table service was just fine.  Classic Margaritas, shrimp ceviche, chile relleno and blackened swordfish tacos were all good.  Two drinks, one app, two entrees, tax and tip about $90.  Would definitely go back again with a larger group so there is more opportunity to share and taste different dishes; prob not, though, for just the two of us.
