I love Mexican food and I love this restaurant. If you are a Mexican food lover like myself, and hate shitty yellow cheese nachos or lettuce/tomatoes with your tacos, this is your place. Onions, cilantro, lime, and pastor is the way to go. They even have cactus and 2 great salsas. Insanely cheap as well.
