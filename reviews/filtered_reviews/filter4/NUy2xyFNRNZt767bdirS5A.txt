I grew up on Los Dos Molinos: hot and spicy Mexican food with distinctly southwestern flavors. It's one of my go-to, tippy top stops for Mexican food in the Valley.

But nothing beats bringing your parents and boyfriend here when y'all visit Arizona for the first time together, and watching with horror as sweat beads near his temples from the salsa alone.

"Is it all going to be like this?" he'll ask.

"Yeah," you'll say, as you hand him a delicious margarita, knowing all will be sweaty and well.
