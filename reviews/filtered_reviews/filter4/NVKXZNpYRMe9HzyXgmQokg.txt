Now if you like Mexican food and you prefer it HOT, I mean seriously HOT, Five Alarm HOT, then my friend Los Dos Molinos in the answer to your prayers. 

The food is wonderful, with combinations you'll find nowhere else. But seriously, did I mention it's hot? Oh and by the way, at Los Dos Molinos the green salsa is the HOT one not the red.

No light-weight type meals here, and on their whole menu I think there are only 2 or 3 items not marked as HOT. But it is amazing how well you can deal with the pain when the food is so incredible.

The place is a dive by any standards but well worth the trip. Try the Mexican Pizza, I dare you. Yes it's hot and yes it may take a while for your tastebuds to recover, but you will be addicted from the first bite!
