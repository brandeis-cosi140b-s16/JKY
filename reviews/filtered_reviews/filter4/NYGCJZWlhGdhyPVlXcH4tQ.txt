I've been wanting to try this place for a while and it turned out to be pretty good. The decor and atmosphere is very fun with a mid century vibe and large patio. My husband ordered 3 tacos; steak, shrimp & cod and I ordered the sweet corn and avocado Caesar salad with added braised green chili chicken, and we both had the prickly pear iced teas. Service was fast, brief but friendly and our iced teas were kept full. All three of my husband's tacos were delicious. It was fun trying all of the sauces/salsa options that they brought to the table, each one was better than the next. I especially enjoyed the garlic beet crema sauce which went great on the cod taco. The standout was the braised green chili chicken that I added to my salad. It was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of flavor, when I return I will definitely order this again.
