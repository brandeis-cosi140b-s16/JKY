This is fast becoming our favorite fast food place. If we want a sit down full service experience, then it is Lindo Michocan. If it is fast food, then forget taco bell, del taco or chipotle, it is Taco y Taco. It  has a variety of meats and styles of  street foods that you would see in Mexico, at a reasonable price. Well we return? Of course it is close to the house and GOOD!
