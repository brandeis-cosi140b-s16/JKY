Pretty good.

Another gentleman (Bowie P) reported in his quite negative review of this place that he was led to a booth with a seat cushion that had a rather large (8-inch) gash in it.  My guess is that I was sitting in that very same booth, although they taped up the hole at some point since June.  It was still not the most comfortable place to sit, mind you. . .

The food was good tasting, with a distinctive flavor.  Some of the better rice and beans I've had too.

Service did not always strike me as the most sincere, and my drink refill was just banged on the table on one occasion.  Still not bad.  Kind of a '70s or '80s look to the place--some of the decor though, as attractive as it was, seemed caked in dust.

Not perfect, but a sizable and tasty meal.  Price average.
