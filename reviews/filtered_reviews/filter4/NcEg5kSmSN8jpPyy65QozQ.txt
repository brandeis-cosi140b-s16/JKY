Good food, great salsas, great service. Pretty room, and friendly & attentive service. We were there for dinner (bonus -- happy hour runs through 7:00). Started off with chips and a variety of salsas. Loved the chipotle, as well as the avocado. Street tacos were $1.50 each so I tried all 4. Short rib, pork and chicken tacos were all very good. Octopus was only so-so; would have preferred more grill/char flavor. Decent craft beer options, although no drafts and high priced ($5?) for "happy hour". Nice place, we'll be back.
