it's a dose of mexican comfort food and hospitality.

i'm definitely not a mexican food connoisseur, but i definitely know fresh, tasty, and homemade food -- and this is where it's at!

conveniently located around the biltmore area, the restaurant is a pop of color on 24th street. you can't miss it!

for dinner, we didn't need reservations on a wednesday, and were greeted with warm, professional, and attentive service. the menu offers many traditional mexican plates of food (like the delish mole poblano i had), so don't be expecting any nachos, quesadillas, enchillada buffet (though i secretly wished they had some).  everything from the BYOB (with no corkage or additional charges), to the personal service, and the free-flow pour of aqua frescas (watermelon for me, yum!), was just so home-style and comfortable. 

the food was no different - the guacamole, the tortillas, the mole sauce, and even dirty rice -- all tasted like it came from mama's kitchen.  there was enough depth of flavor for all dishes to be interesting, and enough simplicity to make it casual and easy to eat! (use your hands!) portions were just right, and coming from san francisco, all that food for under $50 was a steal!

definitely a go-to for the next biz trip to phx... gracias senorita!
