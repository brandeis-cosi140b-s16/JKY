I wish I'd gotten the waiter's name. He was incredible. The drinks were 'well balanced,' i.e. not watered down.  I got the naked guacamole. It was super bland but I mixed the salsa in and it was better.  Also got the shrimp tacos and they were great. The rice was overcooked but whatever.  I wouldn't recommend it to friends but I'm not upset about the experience. The waiter made the experience good even though the food was nothing to write home about.

Beyond the food, my other complaint is seating.  The raised seat limits my parents and my in-laws from attending.
