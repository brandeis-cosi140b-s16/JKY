My mom has been a vegan for past 4 years and has slowly started incorporating meat back into her diet. It was her birthday and really wanted a green chile burger. This place had awesome reviews and overall the whole family was pretty happy. The green chile burrito was huge but very tasty and had just the right spice. $5 margaritas for happy hour were pretty tasty and service was very good! Would definitely come back here and hopefully when it isn't freezing outside will be able to sit on the gorgeous patio.
