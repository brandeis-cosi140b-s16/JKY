This place is a great part of downtown Las Vegas, offering something different and delicious.  

The pozole is fantastic,  and the portion is large.  We also shared a plate of nachos.  They were quite good and offered a lot of meat and beans to chip ratio, however,  this is definitely an appetizer portion, maybe 6 chips total although they were loaded with toppings.  Carne Asada tacos were also quite good.  

The drinks were fantastic. We had several different margaritas and all were delicious,  maybe just a tiny bit too sweet. They also have an amazing selection of tequilas so we took a few shots as well.  They offer a tequila flight that I would be interested to try at another visit.  

The service was great,  helpful not over bearing.  This place is also the perfect balance of unique and interesting without being intimidatingly hipster.
