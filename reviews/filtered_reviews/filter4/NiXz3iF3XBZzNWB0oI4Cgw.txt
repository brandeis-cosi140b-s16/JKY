Great food.  I ordered the chips and salsa.  Costs a buck but was worth it.  They came out hot.  And I loved the house salsas.  Only negative was that the chips on the bottom were covered in grease.  They should shake out the grease more but otherwise fantastic. Then I ordered the Carne Asada burro with a side of beans.  It was heavenly. Good flavor.  Tons of meat,  good guac.  Again,  I knock a star for the grease. It was dripping out of the burro. The beans were the best I've ever had. I'd recommend this place in a heartbeat.  They just need to cut back on the oil and I'd love it even more.
