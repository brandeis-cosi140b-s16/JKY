Man, my 4th burrito this week... 

In terms of other places in Charlotte, Sabor is one of the few places that can honestly brag about being one of the best burrito spots in Charlotte.

The steak "3 Amigos" burrito I had was stuffed to the brim with meat, rice and beans. While filling and actually pretty tasty, I couldn't help but shake the thought that the burrito was pretty...bland. 

I just wish it had more of a kick to it, whether it was spice or flavor or just something. The steak, while tender, wasn't really seasoned. The rice felt bland. Everything else in the burrito tasted like what a good burrito should.

I'm willing to give this place another shot. Compared to chain burrito joints, Sabor ranks much higher than them, and even ranks about equal with another local burrito place in Charlotte, Phat Burrito. But when compared to The Burrito Factory, this place has a ways to go to claim the top spot in the city.
