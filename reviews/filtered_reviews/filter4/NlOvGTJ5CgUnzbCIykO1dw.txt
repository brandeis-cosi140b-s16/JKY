It's hard to find the best tacos in Las Vegas, I can never find good tacos but ever since I discovered this place I don't have to wait to go to Mexico to eat tacos. I have the tacos right here in town they are freshly cooked, served, and the variety is just breathtaking. This is the best in Las Vegas, on a scale of 1 to 10 a 9. If you want tacos or delicious carne asada fries this is the only place in town where you won't be disappointed, you must try it
