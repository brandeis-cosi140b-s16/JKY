My friends and I casually walked into tako not knowing that reservations had to be made weeks before for a guaranteed table. Good thing the weather was nice and outdoor seating was available in 20 minutes when we got there. One word of advice, definitely go for outdoor seating if you can. The environment inside is just way too chaotic, dark and bar-like, that you can barely hold a decent conversation with the people you're with. I'm not too sure what vibe they are going for, but indoor seating is definitely not ideal. 

As for the tacos, they are hands down one of the best I've tasted albeit a little pricey. If you're planning on ordering 7 or more sets, get the combos which will save you a bit of money if you're going for the more expensive tacos. I tried the chorizo, Korean, Baja and pork shoulder one. Each of them had just the right amount of filling and flavor. I'd recommend the Korean most, because it's a nice twist to your regular taco. If you're a fan of egg, go for the chorizo one.

Two tacos in a set might seem like a little, but I was stuffed after my first 2 out of 4. Will definitely come back when I get the chance too! (And hopefully get outdoor seating...)
