I love Gallo Blanco so I knew I was bound to enjoy Otro Cafe. I started with some yummy guac and despite the fact that it was a million degrees out I was so utterly compelled to try the chicken soup and I'm so glad I did. The small order was huge with rice noodles and chunks of white meat in a delicous broth. The BEST thing about the soup is that they serve basil, cilantro, peppers and spicy soy sauce to season to your taste.....part of me wished it was cold and I was sick so that I have it cure me......I know I'm a sick bastard.

I finished up with carne asada and shrimp tacos (shrimp aren't my favorite, truth be told!) and a side of black beans. I really enjoyed my meal and my sever was so sweet and friendly. The ONLY thing they didn't have which I was so looking forward to was the chicarron de queso, the awesome cheese crisp they serve at Gallo Blanco. I REALLY hope they add this to the menu.

So glad these guys are here because Gallo Blanco can get crowded.
