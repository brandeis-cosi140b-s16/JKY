I liked this place.  It didn't blow my socks off or anything, but it doesn't have to.  It's a burger joint and the burgers are pretty damn good.  For $1, you can add chilli, so fuck yeah, I got myself a chilli burger.  I haven't done that in years and I regret NOTHING.  They have good fries and I had some onion rings to share between me and my girlfriend, too.

They also serve Mexican food which I'm curious to try, but in a much more morbid form of curiosity, the same level of curiosity that allows young men to watch horrible, horrible videos online.  Chances are, if you serve burgers and burritos, either only one will be good or both will be terrible.  I don't think they can do both; historically, I've never experienced this, but I'm not gonna ding 'em on something I've never tried.

Overall, they're attentive, they have damn reasonable prices and their burgers and fuckin' YUM.
