Really good! Shrimp tacos are great but really pricey... Highly recommend going during happy hour. Other wise your paying a lot for a little bit of food.

UPDATING MY REVIEW:

We have gone back a couple of times since this review and me and my husband really enjoy sitting up at the bar, watching a game and munching on that delicious bowl of chips and salsa.  The staff is super friendly and is starting to become one of our favorites downtown. But still we try to only go at happy hour, otherwise its really pricey.
