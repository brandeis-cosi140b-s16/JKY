Great service and great food. I ordered the carne asada and it was cooked to perfection. Although it wasn't a traditional carne asada, since it was just a full steak and not a thinly sliced steak, it was still phenomenal. The service was amazing. I never had to ask for anything as the service was always one step ahead. Props to the bathroom attendant for superior service and a great food recommendation.
