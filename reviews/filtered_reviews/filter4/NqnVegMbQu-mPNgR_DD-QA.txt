My profound love of Mexican cuisine and a bevy of shining Yelp reviews of this place led me here last Saturday night. My BF and I arrived just after 7pm, which was perfect because just after we ordered the place filled up- fast!

The salsa bar is fantastic! Some of my fave's were the peanut, chipotle, strawberry and a chunky dark one who's name escapes me..... But really they were all good.

The very best taco that we tried was the Cochinita Pibil (sp?) It was heavenly- packed with meat that had a kind of smokey, kind of mole/chocolaty taste- it was incredible. All the taco's we had were great though. To start with- the tortillas are so freaking good on their own, and they pack the meat inside of them. I'm getting hungry just thinking about them.

Lastly, my BF is a lifelong connoisseur  of quesadillas, so we ordered a steak one to split. Holy crap- it was a monster! They split it up for us but it looked like we ordered two of them! Humongous! It resembled a strudel pastry! Big, flaky and lightly drizzled with something white, sour cream maybe? I dunno, but it was to die for!  Even the next day when we reheated our leftovers this cheesy doughy meaty concoction was still fantastic! The chicken tinga burrito was almost BETTER the following day! (Maybe because it didnt have to compete with any tacos)! 

All in all we were very satisfied and will definitely be back. I would like to wait for a bit cooler weather though, because the place is quite warm inside. That is why I only gave it four stars.
