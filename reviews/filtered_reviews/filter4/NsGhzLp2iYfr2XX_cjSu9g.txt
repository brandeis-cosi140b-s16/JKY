So let me start out by saying I'm not a chimichanga kind of person. I don't usually like how heavy and bland they are. BUT taqueria Guadalajara has converted me.

The chimichanga outside was crispy yet fluffy, and inside the extra cheese and beef was just awesome. I felt like I was eating the best meat pastry ever (because I probably was). It was also a good portion and only 7 bucks.

I also tried the huaraches (the regular ones). They left a little bit to be desired. They were not as flavorful as I expected. The guacamole was also not very good (probably came out of a can), and the fried jalapeños were not at all what I expected. They weren't bad, but they were not anything like a jalapeño popper. The beef tacos were solid.

The bottom line: I will be back for the chimichanga, and will probably never get around to trying anything else.
