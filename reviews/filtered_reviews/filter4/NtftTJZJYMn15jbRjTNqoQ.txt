I am a local so going to a tourist spot did not really excite me but I was pleasantly surprised. It is expensive compared to many local Mexican places but the ambience cannot be beat. We had the guacamole and homemade chips. The Guac is prepared at the table and was delicious. $10.00 for this as an appetizer and there was more than enough for 8 of us. I had the steak Fajitas and they were tasty but the $27 price tag will prevent me from going back. The tourists do not mind paying this. The appetizers like the quesadilla is good and I would order that and a sale next time. I went a week ago and the property is decorated for Christmas. It is beautiful. Today the USA Today named it one of the ten best decorated hotels in the USA. This is a nice treat but that is it. I will stay with my favorite, Nando's. Valet parking only and oh...if you want to self park at this time of year it is ...ready....$30!!!!
