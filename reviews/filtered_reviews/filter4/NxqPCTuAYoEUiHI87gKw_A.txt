Excellent food! I was here for a lunch meeting and was treated but I believe for the 3 of us the bill came out to $40 if you're trying to estimate cost. Note we were here on a Monday and they close at 4:00 pm on Monday's. 

There was ample seating inside, but I can see it hard to grab a seat during the lunch rush. 

They have your standard mexican dishes. I was craving some tacos so I ordered the Al Pastor Taco combo with beans and rice. I was hardly able to finish but it was too good to leave left overs. The chips and salsa were yummy too. Interestingly enough they were lacking hot sauce options and brought out a small condiment cup of Tapatio when I asked for some. 

Everyone else seemed to tear up their food as well and seemed satisfied. Reason for the 4 stars then? It's not the best mexican food I've had, so I have to save the 5 stars for my favorite places, but for a lot of people this is a 5 star place.
