Breakfast, lunch or dinner this is one of my all time favorites in the valley for true mexican food. Nothing fancy .. you'll find only the basics. Order at the counter, sit down & wait for your number to be called then enjoy your meal on paper plates or in a styrofoam container. The chorizo or machaca & egg burritos for breakfast are very tasty and I enjoy everything on the menu for lunch/dinner.

This place would be 5 stars on my list if it 1) was open on Sundays and 2) served beer.
