I was very impressed with everything about this spot.

The Decor was modern and well done. Open Lay-0ut w/ Patio.

The Order style is Fast food style ...order at the counter and wait. Food was quickly made. Was Fresh and No complaints.

The Food: I ordered a  Street Tacos plate with Carnita Asada, Pollo, and Shrimp. All of it was AMAZING. Salsa was Great too!!!.

Will be back. ONLY next time I'll bring friends.
