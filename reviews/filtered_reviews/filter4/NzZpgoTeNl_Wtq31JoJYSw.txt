Lunch time. Was at a friends house and he suggested the Taco Guild. 
What a neat place for lunch. Worth the trip just to see the inside of the old church it is located in. Beautiful stain glass windows. 
Now for the food? I got three different kinds of tacos. Don't remember but I think there were about 8 different ones to choose from. These tacos were what I would call street tacos. I may be wrong with my definition but that is what they reminded my of. Lot of other stuff on menu but only tried the tacos. The ones I had was good. I will definitely return. The service was good and everyone was friendly. Their lunch pricing was very good for the quality and quantity of food. 
Now the bad. As with most of the new places it is noisy. Hard to carry on a conservation with the people that are with you. Maybe if you can't talk to your lunch partner you hurry up and eat and leave, making room for the next people???
Anyhow I will return as I like the old church and the food.
