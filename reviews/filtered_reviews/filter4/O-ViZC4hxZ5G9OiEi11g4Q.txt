We went there for a graduation dinner last June, and overall, we enjoyed our experience at Frank & Fina's. The decor was nice, the dining room was clean, and the staff was attentive. The owner himself greeted us at the door, seated us, and looked after us with warm hospitality. The chips and salsa were fresh and good quality, and so was the guacamole. I prefer guacamole with a bit of a kick,  and it was nice and fresh, and we actually ordered a third serving because the first two went so quickly. Ordinarily, our family frequently eats typical Mexican food at home (tacos and enchiladas) so we thought we'd try the daily specials on the board at the hostess stand. The adults had the special Tamarind Margarita, which was a little sweet for my taste, but it was acceptable, and the rest of our party had compliments.  For my entree, I tried a pork stew from Veracruz which was a very nice low carb dish which I truly enjoyed. For dessert we had coconut flan, which was pretty nice.
