I was in Vegas a couple of weeks ago and I went to Juan's with a huge group. First, the chips and salsa are endless and excellent. Vegetarians, be sure to ask for the vegetarian friendly black bean dip! I am told by my meat eating friends that it is not as good as theirs, but oh well!  Juan's was located on the way to the Red Rocks so it was a perfect stop for us. The atmosphere was casual, and everyone was very friendly. 

I ordered an enchilada, and it came with a huge portion of rice and beans. The portions in general are HUGE. Oh, and did I mention they bring out a little bowl of tomato soup before your meal? It was a nice touch, even though it was 110 degrees outside!
