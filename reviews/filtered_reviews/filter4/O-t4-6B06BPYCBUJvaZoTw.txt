Excellent stuff. I like the lengua best followed by spicy pork then the carne asada. But they were all great. Their aqua fresca was not very good though, too watery, and dispensed through a soda machine instead of the traditional big glass jar.  Probably best as a late night eat but we ate it for a late breakfast and it hit the spot! The grilled green onions were a real treat.
