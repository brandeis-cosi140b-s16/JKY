Nice little Mexican joint within a hotel. The menu is limited, but my group enjoyed everything we ordered. The street tacos were pretty good. The mezcal mule wasn't; too sweet, but I didn't say anything so I could have asked for another. Parking is limited, but that's just how it is in Old Town. It is conveniently located by all the shops and bars.
