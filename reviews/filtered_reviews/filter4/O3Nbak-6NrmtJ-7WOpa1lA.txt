What is the one thing everyone looks forward to when going to a Mexican-style restaurant?  Chips & Salsa!  And, of course, drinks!

Bottomless chips and salsa is the first thing served to you after you are seated.  The staff is efficient and nice, and are always happy to give you more chips & salsa!  A lot of places have become cheap with their chips, bread, whatever it may be that is usually free.  But not Viva Zapata's.  

The Chile Relenos are excellent.  Definitely my go to place for Mexican food.  

I dare you to eat your entire plate of food too.  It's enough food for today and tomorrow.

The location is awkward, as it's right across a gas station; but definitely worth, at the very least, checking out.
