Tonight was my first time at Sabor Latin. Overall: Delicious food, friendly service, and a great locale. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the margaritas were a little weak (in that they were lacking tequila). But other than that, everything was perfect! 

We started out with the queso, which was the perfect consistency and temperature, then we had guac and a papusa, both of which were really tasty. We had tacos authenticos and nachos for dinner and were really pleased with the whole experience. Oh, and don't forget about the salsa bar! They have several different kinds of salsa, including some salsas for spicy food fiends like myself. It was awesome!

This is definitely our new neighborhood mexican joint, and I would highly recommend it to others.
