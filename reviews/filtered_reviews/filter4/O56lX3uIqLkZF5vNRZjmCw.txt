Manuel's is our standby Mexican food restaurant in the Valley, due to its reasonable prices, friendly service, and consistently good food. Over the course of 8 or so years, we've gone to Manuel's and never gone away wishing we had gone somewhere else.

The portion sizes are great for the price. And the chips & salsa they bring when you're seated is quite good. You would think that would be easy, but so many Mexican restaurants bring you watered down salsa for you to dip their greasy chips in. Not here!
