My husband and I were looking for a Mexican food place to eat that we haven't been to already.  So we browsed through yelp and found this spot with an attractive star rating.  As we pulled up to the spot we noticed they were a little busy,  not a whole lot, so we decided to give it a try. When we walked in the door we were a little confused because we weren't sure where to order the food. They seemed to be short staffed or something because they seemed a little confused too. We figured out that they are trying to have the same concept as Tacos El Gordo, where you order your tacos from different people based on what kind of meat you want, but it wasn't really working. My husband tried ordering from the man taking care of the el pastor  section but he seemed very busy and distracted so we flagged down this young guy in the back . We placed our order; 1 quesadilla carne asada, 1 burrito carne asada, 2 tacos all pastor, 1 taco de  cabeza and 1 taco de tripas.  It was a little chaotic receiving our order because they gave it to us little by little instead of all at once. I was getting frustrated so I decided to go pay while we waited for all of our food. The girl at the register was very attentive and nice. Now to the food, well from the photos I had seen here on yelp and the food people were eating there, I could see a lot of similarities with Tacos el Gordo. I my opinion the tacos are identical to El Gordo.  Same tortillas,  meats, salsas, everything.  I wasn't really crazy about the carne asada burrito so my husband ate it. This could easily turn into a five star rating if they change their concept of ordering, but for now it's a four.  One thing I really did enjoy was that there wasn't a mass crowd like el Gordo. So next we're on that side of town we will probably give it another try.
