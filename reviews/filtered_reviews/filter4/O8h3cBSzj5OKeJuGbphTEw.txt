Just had the 3 street taco meal. That was great!
They were quite busy when I arrived and it was standing room only so I ordered to go. By the time my order was ready the place was only 1/3 full....bad timing on my part, friday@12:30. I got one pollo, one carnitas and one pastor. They were all great. The meal also comes with rice and beans. Im full for $7. There are 7 tables and some outdoor seating so its a small place.  One wall is adorned with some cool murals.  I'm keeping this place on my list for sure.
