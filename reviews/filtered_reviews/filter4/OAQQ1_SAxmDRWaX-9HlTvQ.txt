Came in about an hour before closing and sat at the bar for beers and an appetizer.  We usually go to the downtown location but live in the Summerlin side of town now so wanted to give the new location a try.  Nick the bartender was very attentive and overheard me say chips and salsa to the person I was with and quickly turned around and said, "did I hear chips and salsa?" He put our order in and I added on the 3 street tacos with shrimp, fish, and carne Asada.  Food came out pretty quick and I enjoyed everything.  I don't expect authentic Mexican food but when I go to Nacho Daddy I expect good food and a fun atmosphere which is exactly what I got!  I was still hungry so I ordered the queso fundido which I really enjoyed also, I will definitely come back to try more things on the menu and try out their happy hour. 
* they play music videos at the bar which is a plus since I never see music videos anywhere anymore! See you soon Nacho Daddy!
