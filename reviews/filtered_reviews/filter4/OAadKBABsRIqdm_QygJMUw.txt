Very fresh and delicious food.  I would recommend the Carne Asada burrito and the street tacos.  I occasionally get the Carnitas in the  tacos but it has been hit or miss lately.  The salsa they include with the meal is fantastic.  My wife loves the bean and cheese burritos.  Pro-tip:  If you are going through the drive thru bring a book, iPad or gaming device.  It is going to be a while but it's worth the wait.
