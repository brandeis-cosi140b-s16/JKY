I have been to the Mission twice - once when it first opened for lunch and recently for dinner after receiving a gift certificate.  The atmosphere is really nice...beautifully done inside and a nice patio outside.  The service is definitely great and they'll help with recommendations.  I started with the shaved kale salad with almonds, goat cheese and blood orange, followed by the chilean salmon as my entree and haricot verts and both types of grits on the side.  This place is popular, so make sure and snag a reservation if you plan to come for dinner.
