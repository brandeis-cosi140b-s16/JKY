This place is a lot bigger, nicer, cleaner than the original Cave Creek location with better d√©cor.

The food is the same as the original location, very authentic, delicious and big tortas.  Actually, everything is done big!  The enchiladas, with fresh made tortillas, the quesadillas, the drinks...even the tacos have a lot of meat.  So yummy.

My favorite is the pina colada drink and all the other fruity drinks.

This food is expensive though, so we only go as a family treat.  Otherwise, your local Mexican restaurant or Ranch Market will give you the same for cheaper.

Also, Thursdays kids eat free.
