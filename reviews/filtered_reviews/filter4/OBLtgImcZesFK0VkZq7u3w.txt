I had the luck of being maid of honor and had never been to Vegas! So in turn I was in charge of he bachelorette party. I looked up some spots and Yolos seemed to have all the options and variety on the menu that I was looking for. I ended up getting in contact w Jason Carr, who was super knowledgeable and broke down my options for a party of 14 girls to fill their stomachs for the night ahead. He was very accommodating considering I was making plans from Ft. Lauderdale, FL! I We conducted all business via phone and email. Once I got there I was honestly expecting disaster BUT everything went smoothly! Our server, I unfortunately forget his name, was great and on top of things! I was also hooked up with a Blue Long Island or 2 for all my hard work and planning. (thank you Jason&Server!)

Our group chose from the Three-course menu which was great and posed a lot of options for having such a big group. They served appetizer of Chips n Salsa, Salad: Mixed Green or Caesar. Entrees we all had the options of Petit Filet Mignon, Glazed salmon, or Pollo Rostizado. I had the Filet Mignon which was flavorful and tender. :)

Everyone was fat and happy, pleased with the options. We paid per head a flat rate which was a great price and worth the quality of the size meal we received and gave us a great start to our night in Vegas! 

Thank you so much Yolos for maing my job as MoH easy and successful!! (;
