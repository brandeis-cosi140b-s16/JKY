I just read the last review by Mike and I want to second his comment about the defects of Barrio. The prices are definitely higher than what I am used to for dinner and the portions could be seen as small. We went after having some chips and guacamole as snacks at my house knowing the wait for a table would be over an hour (we were warned ahead of time by several people that we would have to wait, especially on a Saturday night). We sat outside on some benches and watched as three groups of people came and left due to the wait. We were seated in less time that quoted which is always a nice surprise. The waiter was very busy with all of his tables and we felt that he could have used some help. The fresh guacamole we ordered was supposed to be made at the table, but because we were seated in a corner surrounded by other tables, he made it in front of the other tables and brought it to us. That was very disappointing as I felt he really did not make an effort to provide us with the entertainment that the guacamole making provides. The food arrived in the expected time and was just right to eat. Each of us ordered a different taco plate and shared the meal which was fun to get to sample each meat. I ordered the pork knowing that it was delicious and I was very satisfied by the texture and flavor. I recommend that dish for anyone who goes to the Cafe. We finished the meal with a shared portion of the churro and ice cream dessert. Very satisfying. I will go back again, but not anytime soon.
