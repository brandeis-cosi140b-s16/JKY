I'd seen this place on tv a while ago and was curious.  I mean seriously.   Mexican / Chinese fusion?!  Well, it sounds whonky and a bit weird.  In function, it is REALLY good.  

My first time there was a little daunting.  They were kind enough to let me try a few samples before I dove in since I was a Chino Bandido virgin.  I chose the combo, venturing to try the Emerald Jade Chicken quesadilla and a Jade Red Chicken burrito with refried beans and the plain fried rice.  

The Jade Red Chicken was sweet and sour with a bit of kick in a tortilla much like you might get with a moo goo gai pan at places.  It was amazing.  The quesadilla was very nice.  The ginger/green onion sauce was very tasty though there was a bit much on the oil in that sauce.  Otherwise, with the rice and beans, it was delicious.  

The staff was very nice from start to end.  The gal who helped me with the samples also took my order and dropped the food off.  Not sure if that is normal, but it was awesome.  She was very sweet and very helpful.  (Hopefully I am not out of line by mentioning she was quite cute too.) 

I am not sure how much of a regular I'll be, but for an occasional treat and a Sino-Mexican fix, I'll be back for more!
