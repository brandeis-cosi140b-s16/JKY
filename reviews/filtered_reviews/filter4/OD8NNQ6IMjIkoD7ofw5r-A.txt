Came here recently on a Saturday night since I was staying across the street at Red Rock.  I was craving Mexican food only to find out the Cabo Cantina inside Red Rock is closed and will be turning into a Lucielle's BBQ in the future.  Therefore we decided to head over to Agave.

On a Saturday night I put in a reservation for 8 through Opentable and ended up arriving 45 minutes early.  The hostess told us no problem and sat us down within 5 minutes.  

The one thing that stood out at Agave was that the chips and salsa was already on the table before we were seated.  This is a welcome sight from some Mexican restaurants where you have to wait for a server before and chips and salsa is served.  The other thing is there are 3 different types of salsa served with the chips (mild, pecante and a green).

My party ordered a pitcher of the Agave Margarita and it was just so-so.  It didn't stand out at all.  We passed on ordering a second pitcher.

In terms of the food, I ordered a Machacha burrito and it was delicious.  The shredded beef wasn't dry and was cooked just right.  My wife had the fajitas and the only complaint she had was that the Spanish rice was kind of bland, a little too starchy.

Overall, the service was good, the food was good, the Margaritas could use some help and the prices are a little high for Mexican food ($12-$20).
