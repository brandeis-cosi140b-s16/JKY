Holy happy hour, batman!

Came to Nacho Daddy absolutely famished, and left not being able to finish! 

My friend and I sat in the bar area for happy hour. She ordered two street tacos and queso dip, while I went ahead and ordered the Nacho Average Burger Nachos. There were also quesadillas, Elote (corn), and more giant nacho plates to choose from! 

Apparently, what I got was smaller than the original-non-happy-hour sized nachos, but I definitely couldn't tell! Imagine a big juicy burger. Complete with bacon, diced onions, and loads of cheese. Now, imagine that juicy burger (sans the bun) all chopped up and stacked with delicious chips! DROOL. 

We ordered the 2-4-1 margaritas (good for the original and strawberry ONLY). I would definitely come back to try the white peach margarita. 

Absolutely everything that passed our table while we waited for our food (which came pretty quickly) smelled and looked phenomenal!

I also really appreciated that smoking is not allowed in the restaurant. This California girl is used to her restaurants without a side of nicotine.  

Happy hour is from 3-6 p Monday through Wednesday/Thursday I believe. Great service and excellent food -- go check them out!

Keep it up, Nacho Daddy. I will definitely be coming back!
