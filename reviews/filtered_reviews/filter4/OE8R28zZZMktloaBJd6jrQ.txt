Walking its a bit dark and quiet, didn't see a host welcoming customers and so I wasn't sure where to sit, was a bit strange.
After a few mins i noticed  that the music it was playing wasn't latin music as most of Mexican restaurants, not very traditional mexican place, It was small (but cozy) lounge with gourmet Mexican food. 
 I ordered  just an appetizer avocado bruschetta and a glass of pinot griot , the avocado bruschetta was good but the lemon was overwhelming left me with that bitterness taste in my mouth, my advice - adding a bit of mango and going easy on the lemon.  
What i liked the most was the smell of other customers dishes and their reaction while tasting the food..  Heard a lot of  " oh wow this is delicious" 
Overall it was very pleasant, servers where nice and attentive.
My favorite spot was the patio.. Just sitting by the fountain.
I am looking forward to coming back and ordering other dishes off their menu. I will recommend to friends and family.
