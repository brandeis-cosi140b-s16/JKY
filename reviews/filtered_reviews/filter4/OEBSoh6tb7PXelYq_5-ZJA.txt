The tortilla soup was just plain delicious. I also had some of the nachos with spicy pork and jalapenos and I am pretty sure they were the best nachos I have ever had. The service was below average though. The waitress was not very attentive so we had to keep getting up and asking if we could order food or for more lemons/limes. We came back later and did some shots of tequila and they were extremely expensive... but they were delicious. 

I would go back.
