Loved this place. My son had been telling me about this great New Mexican place he had eaten at. Finally went with him last weekend. I will be back! Just really good homemade food. A little hot and spicy. Thats a good thing though. Had the pork buritto with red and green sauce. Really, really good. The beans were beans. Not mush. Very tastee. Great staff. Ate at the bar. The bartender was great, serving me an ice cold Modelo draft. Highly recommend if you like our food spicy.
