First, the service was ridiculously super. I barely started drinking my soda and the waiter was there asking if I would need a refill. The food also came out super fast.  Second, the bean dip offered for the chips and dip when you first arrive was excellent and it seemed to stay hot until the meal was brought out.  My only complaint was that the cheese enchillada at Roberto's has more flavor than this cheese enchillada.  The portions were huge and the rest was great.
