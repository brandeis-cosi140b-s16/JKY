I'm sticking with a solid four stars for Cabo Wabo after my second visit! I hesitate to say the service was lacking, as our waitress was a total sweetheart. I'm more inclined to say that there is a bit of a timing issue with the food/drink preparation as we had some lengthy waits for drinks and for chips (after getting our guacamole). 

I can overlook service hiccups at Cabo because the food is DELICIOUS. The chips, salsa, and guacamole alone make this place worth a stop. I also can say only good things about my chicken enchiladas, as can my friend regarding her carne asada tacos. The rice side here is special as it's not just red slop...almost more like a paella sans proteins! 

Of note, my Mango Picante margarita was not particularly strong, but it was pretty and tasty.
