Amazing atmosphere, energetic employees that were super and fun to watch their interaction with each other, seem to have their own little world.  
Service was fast and really on top of keeping my Alex's iced tea filled, that's hard to do with Alex, he drinks alot of tea. They get points for that.
I checked into the gluten free options and they didn't have a menu but he did say that their red sauce was made with corn starch, somehow i wasn't completely  convinced so i went safe and went with a taco salad minus the flour tortilla shell, i really enjoyed that, next time i will add green onions, the only thing missing.  I can't remember what my Alex had but here's a picture, it looks really good, huh? I miss eating things like that. Salsa was really hot and i thought the red sauce had tons of flavor, i sided with the red over the green. 
We will eat here again, food was delicious!
