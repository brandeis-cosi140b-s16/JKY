Yes...the service sucks. Yes...the ambiance leaves you wanting "more"....but who cares! The food is amazeballs! Best chips and salsa in town and I have never had a bad thing off the menu. This is legit Mexican food and if you are a foodie, you will not be able to shut up about how good your food is while you are eating it. I hope the bad service and horrible decor don't kill this restaurant because the thought of never having those flour chips again makes me wanna cry.
