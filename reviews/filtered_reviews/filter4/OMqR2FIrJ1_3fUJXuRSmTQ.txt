We returned because I wanted Tacos Al Pastor again. This time I ordered the Al Pastor plate (which is like 4 tacos?) and my boyfriend got the green chile something or other. 

My al pastor was not nearly as good as my first review, it wasn't nearly as juicy and flavorful. However, my boyfriend was in love with his dish.  

I am still keeping my 4 star score, and I will go back and order the al pastor!
