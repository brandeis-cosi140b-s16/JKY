I love Joyride Taco House!  The service is always friendly and attentive.  The decor is fun and contemporary.  Best of all, the food is consistently delicious.  I love the roasted veggies, the Mexican street corn, all the amazing tacos (especially the two kinds of fish tacos), the tamales, the burritos and black beans.  And, oh my, the hot homemade churro's served with slightly spicy warm chocolate sauce for dipping!  Joyride is our go-to place for special events.  There can be a long wait (wish they had call ahead!) and it can be somewhat noisy inside.  But this restaurant is well worth it!
