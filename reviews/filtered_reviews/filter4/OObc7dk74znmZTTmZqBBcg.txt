Had the steak and chicken tacos both on flour tortillas with rice, beans, cabbage and salsa. The hot salsa was really good and really spicy! The mild salsa was a little too sweet for me but I'm not big on sweet. I sampled the fish which was very good and the pork was pretty salty so I went with the chicken and steak. These tacos are massive and I could only finish one but the good news is they taste even better cold right outta the fridge. I'll definitely be back.
