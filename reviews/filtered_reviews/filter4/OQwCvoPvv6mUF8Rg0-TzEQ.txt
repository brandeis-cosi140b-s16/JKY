One of the better Mexican restaurants in the area.  Friendly service, good food and margaritas for $1.75.  If you like to eat, Mi Patio will not disappoint as portions are huge. Once seated with no wait, we were presented with a basket of chips and salsa that were perfection.  For dinner, I ordered a combo ($10.35) Beef Tamale, Beef Taco, Cheese Enchilada, Rice & Beans.  Although I did not love the Tamale, everything else tasted hot and fresh. I like the fact that it is a local, family owned restaurant.  Did I mention the $1.75 margaritas?
