The wild mushroom enchiladas are amazing. Chips, Salsa and Guac were great. The server was great. Only complaint, the girl that seated us was kind rude, I mean she seated us and all but acted as if she was doing us a favor ( you know 'feel privileged I'm letting you in' kinda way ). Also kinda expensive. But will go there again because of those enchiladas.
