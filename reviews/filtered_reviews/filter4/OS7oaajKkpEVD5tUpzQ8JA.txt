I am worried that they are already opening a second location, especially since it's so close to the original.

Love the carne asada tacos. Hate the parking situation. Love the mom-an-pop atmosphere.

And I love the fact that I can ride my bike there, not have to worry about parking, have a couple cold beers on a Friday night and relax.
