Ah, Tia Rosa, I would come here just to bask in the colorful and decorative ambiance of the Mexican folk art decor, with Mexican tile everywhere, even on the tabletops, straw walls and lots of fun decorating. And the food is just as pretty, attractively served and presented on bright and colorful plates. And, by the way, it tastes as good as it looks. There's a reason why, when you drive by here at peak dinner hour time, the parking lot is full.
      On a recent Thursday evening, my husband and I shared carne asada beef and chicken fajitas. Beef comes more like roast beef than the usual sizzling on a cast iron platter, but it's still good. Con queso dip and chips while we were waiting was delicious.  Enchiladas, chimichangas, burritos...it's all good. Is everything totally authentic and all made from scratch?  Probably not, ( no substitutions ), but unless you are particularly discriminating, you won't care. My own personal pet peeve, and perhaps the only one, is the chili relleno is stuffed with pork and not cheese, as is the case in every other restaurant of this type I have been to. Would it be too much trouble to offer a choice?
    A great spot for a gathering of friends or family, and lots of outdoor seating.
