Only place on the A gate side of the airport to get a good drink and people watch while eating some tasty Mexican food. Cholula everywhere, that's my favorite side chick. Large tequila selection if you're lookin to booze through you next flight. 

Also, the larger tables beside the bar have outlets to charge your electronics. Necessity for anyone needing juice. Unfortunately no Wifi. Five stars if that were the case.
