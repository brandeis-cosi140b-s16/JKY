Came here for Taco Tuesday and LOVED it! The interior is modern, I always love brick walls and wood tables. The music choice was on-point. Honestly, sounded like a playlist I have at home so that was a major plus :) The staff is very friendly and educated of the menu. The food was quick! We tried the Salsa flight of 5 different choices and the waitress suggested their best ones (loved all of them). Tried the octopus taco, carne asada, and pollo all three were amazing! Will definitely be returning soon! Perhaps on another Taco Tuesday evening!
