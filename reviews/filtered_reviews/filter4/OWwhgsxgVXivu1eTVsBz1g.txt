Toros is excellent i cant believe I see negative reviews on this place for one food is amazing.Filled with a bunch of flavor,went to dinner with my wife and our server a younger guy i believe his name was omar he was very attentive and a blast ,very easy going and very knowledgeable about the menu gave us some awesome food choices which we decided to order,so glad we did we started off with bacon wrapped stuffed dates they were amazingly delicious,ox tail was amazing,and the croquet's were very good as well ,we ordered half roasted chicken which is amazingly good , and finished off with apple banana bread pudding which our server suggested to us and again best meal we've had.Ill be coming back more then twice a week thanks to the food ,atmosphere, and the service.
