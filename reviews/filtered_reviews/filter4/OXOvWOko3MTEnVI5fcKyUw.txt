I have eaten at Jalapeno Inferno Bistro Mexicano, or Jalapeno's as "we" call it, many times and I have to say that they have never disappointed.  My personal faves are (not necessarily in this order) their mango margarita, flour chips--be sure to try those!, awesome guacamole and salsa -I'm into the hot & spicy so for me the hotter the better & if you're like me don't expect their "hot" to be "hot".  When it is Hatch chile season, be sure to try the Stuffed Hatch Chile, it is to die for!  Again, even though it has the little symbol for "hot/spicy" next to it, it isn't.  Just realize that this is coming from someone who uses ghost pepper salsa on darned near everything...  Nice ambiance, friendly staff and they are very accommodating with my special dietary requests, which can lead to waitperson eye-rolls but never here.  You've got to try the flour chips, they're the bomb!
