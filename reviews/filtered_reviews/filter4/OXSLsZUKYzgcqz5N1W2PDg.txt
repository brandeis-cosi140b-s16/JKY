Well there are a ton of reviews and I can't really say I disagree with many of them.  This place is loud, the parking is nightmarish, and it really doesn't have much of a vibe.  You sort of feel like you're sitting in some cheesy strip mall restaurant (which you sort of are).

All that being said, I ordered the special of the night - an 8oz Fillet Mignon (with potatoes, chorizo, and all sorts of goodness) & 10oz Lobster tail.  The dish was absolutely divine and one of the best things I've ever eaten in CenPho.

My only gripe was the guacamole.  What a big disappointment.  All the hype- the freshness, the tableside, the blah blah blah, the $15 price tag.  You'd think this was ambrosiamole.  Not good at all.  One freakin avacado!?  That's all I get?  And a bunch of pom seeds?!?  No thank you.  I'll take Ticoz guacammus any day over that mess.
