When you're out trying to relive your college days and suddenly need something to satisfy your extreme drunk hunger, keep Fuzzy's in mind. This might be one of the better options on Mill Ave. My sis and I ordered 6 different tacos to sample, ranging from soft tortillas with shredded chicken to crunchy shells with shrimp. The tacos were tasty, although it would have been nice to add some salsa or spice to them to make the meal a tad bit more unique (salsa bar, anyone?!). We did have to wait a while for our meal but that could also be the beer talking.
