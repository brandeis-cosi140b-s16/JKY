Review:  Margaritas, chips, guacamole

Since we were in The Venetian and had just finished seeing The Jersey Boys, we were wanting a little late night snack.  We timed it just right at this place - 9:00pm to closing is Happy Hour and Margaritas are just $5!  Fresh ones too!  No mix.  Fresh lime juice.  Very well made.  We snacked on spicy guacamole and chips, as we sat at the edge of the canal watching the last of the evening's gondola riders go by.  We even witnessed a proposal take place in one of the gondolas!  Good server, very nice ambiance, delicious margaritas!
