This place was super interesting. I was used to the location on rainbow but they moved this location! 
Do. Not come here if you're short on time. It took me about 3 hours to eat here LOL. When we first came in our server was attentive and served our needs and even hooked it up with our margaritas. After 1.5 hours he was no where to be found so we could place our actual order and grab the bill! Everything is a bit overpriced for Mexican food but the portions are freaking enormous!!!!! They also give you free chips, salsa, and bean dip which ruined my meal LOL but I got to take home a massive burrito to eat for the next two days! Overall I'll be back!
