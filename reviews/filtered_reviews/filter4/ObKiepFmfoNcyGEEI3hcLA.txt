I had such a fantastic experience the first time when it was on the strip near the Wynn that I crave it whenever I come to Vegas. I was very disappointed to find out after coming out of the XS that the location changed to somewhere far off strip. Finally when I had a car in Vegas, I took full advantage of it and drove over for a mid-afternoon snack. You definitely need to make the drive when you can to Tacos El Gordo. The Adobada fries are amazing!

The line system is kind of inconvenient. If you want Adobada/Al Pastor and Asada you have to wait in 2 different lines. If you want buche/lengua/tripa it's another line. So if you want a variety of meats, you could potentially be standing in 3 long lines. I recommend that you come with a group so you can split yourselves into each line. I wanted tripa tacos, but i decided against it because it meant I would have to wait an additional 30 minutes and I was on a time crunch.
