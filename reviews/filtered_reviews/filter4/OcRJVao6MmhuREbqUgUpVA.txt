Komex opened up a secondary new location! It was not as busy as the original, though it's brand new and I wonder if people just don't know it's here. It's not far to head here though if the other one has a fairly long wait. 

We met up with our friends and shared a few items and got some individual tacos: 

Tacos - they now offer pork belly which was rather tasty and tender so I definitely recommend getting it on something with it. Also got daegi gogi/pork which is my other favorite taco. 

Pork Belly Fries - Lots of cheese, salsa, jalapenos and pork belly. Messy, but good and a large share- able portion.

Fusion Wings - This comes with plain fries and the wings were nicely crispy with a sticky sweet and spicy glaze. Really enjoyable as I have a little bit of a affinity for sweet and spicy wings.

Fusion Flautas - This is one of my favorite things to get. The flautas are crispy and yet fluffy fried tortilla stuffed with a good portion of meat and cheese. I enjoy the mix of guacamole with sweet Korean sauce they do. I love that there is more than enough for the flautas and extra always to dip chips in! 

Service was friendly enough. We had a second round of tacos and unfortunately it took long to get it. She did apologize and explain that a large party was before our order put in so not really their fault. 

The food taste the same, which is a good thing and I saw one of the owners here running the front so I'm glad they seem to be doing right with consistency of a second location. Will be back, it's not far from my work.
