Have eaten here a couple times and really enjoy the food.  The patio is so cute but the interior of the restaurant is lacking.  So we'll only eat here if we can sit on the patio.  The Mole enchiladas are delicious.  Very reasonable prices especially for Scottsdale!  Not a fancy place like so many others in Old Town, but it's a great place to kick back and relax with friends.  You really do feel like you're in Mexico!
