Tasty carne asada, tasty fish tacos.    Is there any more to say?   With all the options for cheap Mexican fare, it's not hard to be middling; Los Taquitos has a good thing going with simply seasoned well done fresh street tacos.

Serving sizes are adequate to a little too much, and prices are very reasonable.    Definitely a new lunch go-to.
