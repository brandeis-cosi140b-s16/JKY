Oh how I love thee Roberto's.

Pros:
CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP.
Very large portions.
Much closer to authentic than Taco Bell.
Doesn't make for an upset bathroom like Taco Bell.

Cons:
They never season beef or chicken good enough.
Unless we're talking tacos or burritos, sour cream is pretty much included on everything.
A bit too greasy sometimes.

Roberto's is some of the best Mexican food in all of Vegas. It's quite surprising that there's almost 50 locations of it all over town with how consistently good it is. I just wish they did a better job of seasoning meat so I don't have to pour a 1/2 cup of hot sauce or cheese over a burrito for flavor.
