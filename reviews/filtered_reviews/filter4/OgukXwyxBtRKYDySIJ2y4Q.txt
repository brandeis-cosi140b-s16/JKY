I don't particularly enjoy spending a lot of money on mexican food, but Pink Taco was quite good.  Ate the enchiladas, and drank a sangria, and left satisfied and happy.  Also the restaurant is located in the Hard Rock so there is plenty of eye candy around.  I wouldn't frequent this place but would surely return.
