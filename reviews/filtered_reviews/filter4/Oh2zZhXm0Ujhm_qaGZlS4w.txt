The fish and shrimp tacos here are very good! Service was excellent and very friendly. I went around 2pm on a weekday and the resturant was about 1/3 full so I didn't have any trouble getting a table with my friends. This is not a real big place, they have about 10 tables. Everyone had tacos in our group and everyone liked them. I love their hot sauces, they are very good! 
I realized when I hit my navigation this place is close to Goodspeed Performance Lab where I hang out alot so I plan to be back often.
