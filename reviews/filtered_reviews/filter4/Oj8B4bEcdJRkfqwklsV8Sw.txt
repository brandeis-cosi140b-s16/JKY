I never thought that I would get tipsy in church, but alas...it happened. This was hands down one of the coolest places places that I've ever been. My boyfriend and I went on a Monday for happy hour after work. I ordered a house margarita on the rocks and he had a Cartel Double IPA. Both fantastic! 

We were given a plate of chips and salsa that came with four different types to try. If you're a salsa junkie, make sure to ask for your complimentary basket. Their spicy red pepper sauce was my favorite. 

For our meal we ordered three tacos: the ono, the shrimp, and the al pastor. For our sides we got a house salad and street corn. The street corn made us both say hallelujah. It was the best part of the entire meal. 

We both agreed that we would be back with a large group of friends. What a fantastic place!
