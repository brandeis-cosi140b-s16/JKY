I am always up at the Sandbar Desert Ridge location, but because I was on the other side of town I figured I'd give the Chandler location a go. Came in for a late dinner and a few drinks with my sister. Dinner was good, no complaints at all. My 2nd drink was definitely too strong which I hate to complain about but my waitress was very nice about bring me a back of sweet and sour instead of switching out the whole drink. The late night crowd was much different than what I am used to up North at Desert Ridge. Not near as packed and not a very diverse crowd. I did have a nice time but I think I am very comfortable at the Desert Ridge location.
