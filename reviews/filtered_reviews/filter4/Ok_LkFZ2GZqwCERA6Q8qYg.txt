Hole in the wall? Yes
Amazing food? Definitely
Clean? Questionable but I could care less

The tortillas are really as good as everyone claims. Food was prepared pretty quickly. I had two machaca tacos and the beef was really tender and flavorful. A friend from Phoenix recommended this place and we stopped by on a trip from up north. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'll make sure to stop by!
