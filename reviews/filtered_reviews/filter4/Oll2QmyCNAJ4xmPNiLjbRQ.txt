The not-so-cost-conscious bartender was pouring the Cadillac Margaritas tall and strong when I swaggered on to the patio at Frank & Lupe's the other night. It was over 100 degrees outside and the icy concoctions went down nicely. I'll claim it as a medicinal endeavor since I've been told by a Puerto Rican friend that alcohol helps to regulate internal body temperature. I'm no doctor, so I was happy to give it every chance to work its magic. 

The patio was packed when we arrived, but as we polished off our first pitcher of Negro Modelo we were seated. The wait staff here are deft at flipping tables on busy nights, though you never feel rushed. Chips and salsa arrived quickly. Hot, fresh chips and the spicy, cilantro-y salsa that I've come to love about this place. Now, down to the business of ordering. 

There were four of us, so ample opportunity to sample a good portion of the menu. Stacked enchiladas with red sauce and a fried egg on top; carne adovada plate with rice, beans and tortillas; chili relleno that melts in your mouth as well as the ever popular chicken mole (that's 'moe-lay', of course). Served quick and not unlike a mosh-pit on a plate. It's unfussy and a little bit messy. It's how my Mexican food ought to be. 

For dessert (as if anyone needs to chase this kind of dinner with anything more), there were fresh-from-the-fryer sopapillas with honey. Tender and flaky at the same time. It's the reason I wanted a siesta before continuing out the door to our next destination. 

Don't head to Frank & Lupe's for some pansy-ass health-conscious salad or a pretentiously perfect "ameri-mex" experience. You'll be doing yourself a disservice. Instead, prepare yourself for a full on, chili-laden assault to the senses. You won't be disappointed.
