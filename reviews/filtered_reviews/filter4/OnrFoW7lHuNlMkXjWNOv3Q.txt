A great place to have a drink and get a nice view of the strip! I like the open air atmosphere to the strip when the weather permits. The margaritas are very good, but I would go with it 'on the rocks' versus frozen. Your best value is to get a pitcher of margaritas if you are with someone and you think you will each drink 2. They also have a very, very hot sauce that they serve with their chips. Be very careful!
