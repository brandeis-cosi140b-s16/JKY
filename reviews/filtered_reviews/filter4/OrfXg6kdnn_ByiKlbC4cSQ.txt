I love fish tacos and I really like the fish tacos here. They are at a good price and they are tasty! They have a happy hour and are known for their margaritas. I love Mad Mex. Most recently, I got the carnitas burrito and I was in heaven. The burrito itself was tasty and the plate looked very nice. I took a picture of it. The cornbread it came with on the side was really really good. I couldn't get enough! The other side additions (guacamole, salsa, and coleslaw) were good and added to the dish as well. They have a good draft list too. I will definitely be back again soon. Only negative is I ordered takeout once and I think the order got messed up. Anyways, great place. I will continue to enjoy Mad Mex to satisfy my Mexican food cravings!
