They force you into the Million calorie combo.  A rice bowl is not quite enough and by time you add bans its just $..30 more for the big combo.

I finally got a chance to come back in here, I did a to go order for lunch. It was made quickly. I still have no idea how to fill out the order sheet, and despite the a sign on the door saying the use that sheet in the kitchen. 

As usual my food was great as it should be with all of the cheese and fried bits. 

The hot sauce lacked some of the sweetness that I usually like, the color was even off  bit this time.

I was beyond full after this meal, it made me contemplate picking up bulimia.
