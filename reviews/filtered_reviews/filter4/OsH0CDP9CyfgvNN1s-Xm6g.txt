Got the burger with jalapeno. Patties are very thin, about the same thickness as in-n-out if not thinner. Someone looking for a huge juicy burger is going to need more than two patties. They are well charred. The jalapeno was actually cut, rolled out and grilled, then set between the two patties. This makes more uniformity out of each bite, but I think i may enjoy the variance of bites found in a less uniform approach. The burger was salty, and while it was more salt than I desired, the level was not abnormal for a take out meal. The ingredients are quality. 

The place is clean and well designed. They don't have a soda fountain in the dining area, but perhaps except perhaps one behind the counter, which was a minus for me. 

I will be back, but I'd rather try the tacos next time. For a drive through, this is a great option. Not sure how often this place will sway me from other nearby burger options such as Chicago Burger, though.
