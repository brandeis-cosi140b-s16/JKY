I like a laid back spot to watch Sunday football (with Sunday Football drink specials!) and an every day Happy Hour. How can you dislike a place like this? 

All in all I really like the lay out, the server we had was extremely friendly and the food was great. I love their metal star lights, the open floor plan (the above loft is really cool) and of course a more "modern mexican" feel. We ordered chips and guac, their complementary salsa and a friend got the nachos. We each had a Frozen House Margarita and the bill was only $28 between the three of us. 

The guacamole was really well made, nice and chunky with a good hint of lime and chopped up cilantro and tomato. The portions are massive for only paying half price! You can't go wrong with their specials with the amount of food and the strength of the booze you get. 

I've only been here one other time and again had a great experience. They have various taco options that are very good--not crazily adventurous but they will hit the spot and keep you satisfied. This is a nice little addition to Old Town, whether it's for drinks, sports or a little bit of both.
