I'm not a fan of what's annoyingly referred to as "Tex-Mex" food, at all. It gives me the idea of pseudo-not-fast-food like Moe's, or lame cantinas, run by people whose ancestors probably couldn't pronounce "cantina," that cater to the effete-minded "Margaritaville" crowd.

My wife, however, was attracted to the outside decor and lured in by the "gourmet" in the name.

Welp, folks, let me tell you: I'm really glad I went in this place. Their big advertisement is that they want to turn the tide of opinion on Mexican food/Tex Mex whatever from one of greasy, unhealthful junk to tasteful and thoughtfully-prepared fare- to the end of the latter, they did their due on me!

The woman and I had their take on quesadillas, which weren't the usual stupid flat flour tortilla cheese sandwiches with a pile o' salt and a not-pile of meat. In fact, these guys were made from homemade corn tortillas, deep fried (though not doused in grease) and filled well with your menu choice (In my case, al pastor; the wife got mahi-mahi). Folded over like a calzone and topped lightly with cojita sour cream, these guys are filled with flavor- flavor I've not experienced at any other Mexican joint in this city. The light crispiness of the tortilla really drives it home, and the quesadilla in all makes me think more of "tamale grande" than what you would classify as a quesadilla. (again, a boring flat cheese sandwich).

The price is kind of high; and while the portion is not *big* big as if you might get from a typical Mexican restaurant around here, let me tell you pals: It's well worth it.

Can't wait to try some new things here, sometime. In the meantime, go and try a quesadilla if you want to be flavor-blasted for the first time in Phoenix.
