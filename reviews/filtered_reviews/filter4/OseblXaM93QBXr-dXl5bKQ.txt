I've been here a couple of times now for lunch.  I had been to the other location previously known as La Condesa once so I knew the food was going to be good.  And it certainly is.  Parking seems like it could be a hassle at times.  Another Yelper says they park at the school when it is not in session.  This time I noticed the back gate was open with an empty lot on the other side of the alley but my server could not tell me if it was ok to park there.  The salsa bar is always a delight and I try to limit myself to two per meal so I can keep track of what I am having.  Service both times has been OK but sort of an afterthought.  I will certainly keep this place in the lunch rotation.
