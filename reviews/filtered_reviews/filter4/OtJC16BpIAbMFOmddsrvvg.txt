Looking for a great taco joint?  TJ's (it's actually DJ's so idk how that got mixed up, but whatever!) Taco Bar is that place.  The al pastor is amazing!  The barbacoa is also an excellent choice.  Make sure to try their sauces as they are a knock out.  

This is a great place to swing by at any time.  We went four or five times during the week we were in Vegas.  The service isn't always the greatest as it seems their staff isn't that well trained but the food is def worthwhile.  Check it out!
