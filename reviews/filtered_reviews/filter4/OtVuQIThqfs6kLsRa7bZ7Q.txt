Lindo Michoacan= YUMMY
This place is never a disappointment! The staff is always amazing and cater to your every need, the food is always superb, and the drinks are fantastic. I have tried many dishes here, but my absolute favorite are the grilled fish tacos. The guacamole is freshly made at your table so you can pretty much control how you want it to taste. The chorizo fundido or queso fundido is the best I've had (a lot of places will mix in fake tasting cheese, blegh). Cadillac margaritas are the way to go and definitely do their job of getting you tipsy. This is a perfect way to kick off your birthday celebrations. The views are amazing and so are the desserts. I also love their fideo soup (although I think I am the only one I know who eats it lol).
I have been giving this place business for years now and I will continue to do so :)
