I have only been here once, and I'll be back for more!

I came in for lunch, never knowing this place was hidden near the South Park Mall behind some other stores and shops.

Chips and salsa: Pretty yummy, and the salsa had a nice flavor and sutle heat to it.

Firestarter margarita: Jalape√±o infused tequila, fresh lime juice and ginger beer. Great heat. The ginger beer gives it a very unique flavor... unlike any other jalapeno margarita I've had. 

Paco's Taco: Brisket, caramelized onions and chipotle bbq sauce. The brisket full of flavor and piled high. 

Turkey Club Carnitas: slow cooked shredded turkey, sliced avocado, shredded iceberg, jalapeno bacon, tomato and avocado ranch. The Yelp family was right once again. Wow, this is a great taco.

Charro beans: Don't get me wrong, I like black beans.... but I have to go with charro every time for my side. 

Fajitas: Nothing beats the smell of the sizzling plate as it comes out... making all other people jealous that they didn't order it. Huge portion size and a giant plate of fresh toppings. This easily made for two meals. 

I'm a huge fan of this place... and now so is my buddy Steve. He was super impressed by his first visit.
