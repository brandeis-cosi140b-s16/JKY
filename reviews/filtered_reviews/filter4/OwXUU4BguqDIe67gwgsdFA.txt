My husband and I went for a quick midweek lunch. We both ordered the burrito combo. He got steak with their black bean chilly, I got a shrimp burrito with the tortilla soup.  So freakin' good! The soup was perfectly flavored and the burrito was exactly what I needed. I could have finished the whole thing, but then I would have been miserable (if you leave Mad Mex hungry, that's on you). I got my leftovers to go, and then had them for dinner later that night. After a few hours and cold the burrito still help up. The tortilla wasn't at all soggy and the flavor was still on point.  

The Shadyside location is by far my favorite, when they have the front windows open, even in the fall it's just a great place to meet up for a casual meal.
