Tried this place out on a recommendation from one of my husband's coworkers. It's a nice, open restaurant that feels pretty comfortable. The tables seem overly large for the space, and it feels kind of ridiculous to sit down as just a 2-person party at a table that can seat 8 or 10.

The staff was very nice. When they found out it was our first time, they led us over to an area of the counter where we could try their more popular dishes, and explained their ordering system. I didn't find ordering difficult at all. The food came quickly, accompanied by snickerdoodle cookies (yum!) and I thought the price was great. Had enough left over of my emerald chicken for a delicious lunch the next day.
