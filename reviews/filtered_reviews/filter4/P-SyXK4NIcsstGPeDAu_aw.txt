First, the corn-on-the-cob is pure evil....in a good way. OMG I just wanted to...EAT ALL OF IT.

The food overall was delicious and I love, love, love the taco's!  The fish taco is excellent and this crazy good vegetarian taco with poblano peppers, corn, avocado etc it was so friggin delicious, but I did take it up a notch and added chicken...don't judge me! 

My server was cute as all get out, friendly and her menu knowledge was on fleek, but it took a while to get food initially.  After that, all went well. 

Yep, I'll be a regular.
