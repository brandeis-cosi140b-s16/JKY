I am very picky when it comes to mexican food or any kind of latin food. I am of Mexican italian decent and my wife is from central america so we know what is good. I was kind of skeptical about this joint due to the name and location. Gave it a chance and WOW I was impressed with the quality of the tacos and other food they had. Very tasty food and is done with pride...I would say it is a little pricy but if your having drinks and a night out its the perfect food to have with a beer,,
