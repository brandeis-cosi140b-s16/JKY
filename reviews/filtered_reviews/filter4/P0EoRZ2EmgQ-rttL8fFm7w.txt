In a town littered with strip malls and chains, Carlsbad Tavern is a one-of-a-kind restaurant that blends New Mexican with middle American.  They've got a big menu and a lot of great quirky items--the green chile blue enchiladas are great, the tomatillo machaca chimichanga is heartcloggingly good, and the habenero burger is 5-alarm hot.

The service is not particularly stellar here and their drink prices are steep unless you get there for their late night (past 11pm) menu.  Still, it's a great place that's rarely crowded, the enclosed patio is nice, and the food's wild.
