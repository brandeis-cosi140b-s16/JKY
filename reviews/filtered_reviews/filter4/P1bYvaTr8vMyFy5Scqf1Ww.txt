Four Stars are for the tamales and the soup.  Everything else is good, but not up to par with the wonder Mexican food closer to the border (much less in Mexico). 

The staff tends to be friendly there and I was generous with the stars because I do think they should thrive as a business---though they should cut down the menu a bit.

Buy the tamales in bulk for a small group, or even more for a bbq or a party--it's much more cost efficient that way and they heat up nicely.
