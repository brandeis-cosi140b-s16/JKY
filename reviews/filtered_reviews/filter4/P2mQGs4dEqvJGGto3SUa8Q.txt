We celebrated my husband's grad school graduation here last month. I made reservations in advance for our party of 8. When the ceremony ran long, snow was falling, and traffic was miserable, I called ahead to the restaurant. The girl who answered the phone seemed genuinely happy to accommodate us 45 minutes later than planned.

Upon our arrival, we were immediately seated. I had also brought along some personalized graduation cupcakes (which I'd gotten permission for in advance when making my reservations). The hostess offered to keep them in the back, in the frig if necessary, and deliver them to our table following our meal. The dessert delivery happened without me needing to remind anyone.

Tableside guacamole was terrific! I've had this several other places but Vida's is the best in my opinion. The generous serving size was plenty for our table of 8. 

Heard nothing but positive food reviews from everyone we dined with - some got lunch, while others got brunch. 

Service was good. Drink refills could have been a little faster. We had two servers (one in training, perhaps?) - they were both very friendly, and offered meal suggestions.

Several of us agreed we'd be back. I'd like to go back to sample one (or two!) of the many tequilas they had on their menu.

My only reason for withholding the 5th star - paid parking at the EpiCentre garage.
