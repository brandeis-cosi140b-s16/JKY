First time to the Pink Taco. Was at the Hard Rock so we tried this place. Sat outside on the patio. It was a Thursday night  so it want not too packed. Service was good. Pitcher of Margaritas you cant be that. I did try their signature Pink Tacos(Panuchos) and they were damn good. 3 good size tacos, the pickled onions were a little different but I would order them again
