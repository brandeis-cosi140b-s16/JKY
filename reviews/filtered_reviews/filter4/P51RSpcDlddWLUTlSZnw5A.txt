Coming from CA, I have my Mexican food that I am used to where it is usually healthy portions.  The burritos are what I would get at this place, but the other dishes aren't as plentiful.  My body needs a full meal while spending under 8 bucks for some food.  I had to pay a little more to get my fill.  Maybe that is a reflection on me than the restaurant...

That being said I still recommend it and will be going back, just need to know what to order next time
