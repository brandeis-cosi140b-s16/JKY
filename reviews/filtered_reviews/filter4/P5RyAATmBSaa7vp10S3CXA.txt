Yes, my 3 year old spilled salsa not once not twice but 3 times. Our sever happily cleaned it up all 3 times. 

Probably only 1 or 2 salsas that are mild enough for kids. Ours enjoyed the cliantro one and the Pico de gallo. She tried a few others but immediately downed water and her face turned a little red. She may have grown a little hair on her chest. Our favorite salsas were the peanut and guacamole. 

I had the street tacos. Carne Asada taco was on point. Ranking the 3 I had
1. Carne Asada
2. Al Pastor
3. Chicken

Wish I could tell you about the rice but the girl ate it all, so if she ate it I'm sure you will enjoy it too. 

Next time I need multiple margaritas. Happy hour, anyone?!?!
