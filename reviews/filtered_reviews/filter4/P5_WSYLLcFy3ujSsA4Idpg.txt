I needed a quick place for some good grub for lunch and found this place on yelp.  They have a sign that says best carne asada, but I don't eat beef, so I ended up getting the chicken taco combo. I also ordered a fish taco, but I think the guy forgot to ring it up. I didn't see it inside the bag when I got home which was sad.  :-(    They also ran out of corn! 
In addition, I got to try the Pineapple/Coconut Raspado which is a shaved ice cone dessert with ice cream. (It was too sweet for me, but it was tasty)

I like this place. It's a small, independent restaurant with good food and nice people.
