The first words I notice about ISLA are "Tequila Bar."  Awww yeah, I like tequila and I'm going to ISLA.  Who's with me?

So, some coworkers and I decide to cut loose here and we were not disappointed.  From the time we walked in until we left, we were treated to excellent service, wonderful food, and a whole mess of tequilas.  

ISLA is located in the Treasure Island hotel and after a bit of a struggle to find the place, we were pleased with the decor and the vibe.  We didn't have to wait long for a table which is always a bonus in Vegas.  We started off with a round of margaritas and some guacamole.  The margaritas were good, the guac was just so-so.  But the chips and salsa they gave us more than made up for it.  Three types of salsa and really tasty chips - there was something for everyone.

On to the meal.  We had a round of tequila that was quite good.  This wasn't the kind of tequila you do shots of with salt and lime.  This was sipping and enjoying tequila.  All of the meals that came out looked wonderful and everyone was pleased with their choices.  I heard that the meat was cooked perfectly and the tortillas were fresh and tasty.  I had the shrimp tacos and they were out of this world.  

Sadly, we were too full for dessert, but not for another round of margaritas and tequila!  This place was a lot of fun and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a nice Mexican meal where you won't get a foot-long flume of frozen margarita.
