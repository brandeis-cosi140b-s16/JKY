I've lived near Jalisco for 2 years and LOVE Mexican food yet have never had the desire to try the restaurant because the sign is ugly and uninviting!! My husband however knowing my love for Mexican food decide to take me there for a date! I've now been to Jalisco twice and have been sooo impressed with the environment, service and food!! I have greatly enjoyed my experiences!!!
