I feel bad saying it, but we went here on Christmas day because we're new to the area, our families are on the east coast, and we didn't feel like cooking a holiday meal for just 2 people.  Our first good sign was that the place was slammed.  Even still, we were greeted by a friendly staff and seated quickly despite how busy they were.  

We were shortly served crisp chips and both salsa and a spicy bean dip.  We narrowed down to a few choices from their large menu, and took some advice from the waitress.  Our drinks came shortly after, and before long we had our food.  The food was hot and fresh, and delicious.  By far, our favorite Mexican restaurant yet.  We've tried several over the 9 months we've lived here, and while most were just ok, we actually enjoyed the food here.

The dining area was fairly large, and is colored brightly with a tropical theme.  The bathrooms were clean, and the sinks had a really cool fish design.  Kind of a weird thing to comment on, I know, but I felt it worth mentioning.

Overall we had a very good experience here, and I am definitely looking forward to going back and trying more dishes from their huge menu.
