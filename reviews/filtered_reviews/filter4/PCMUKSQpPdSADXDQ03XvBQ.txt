The wait was 10 minutes but they sent us a text when our table was ready. So we went shopping in the boutiques across the street. Unless you sit outside, its impossible to have a conversation with out yelling. They have a good selection of local beer and about a dozen margaritas. 
We ordered the beer batter fish tacos- they were big and filled with yummy but very greasy fish.  ( next time Im going to try something grilled) ). It came with 2 sides- i had black beans and rice- both perfectly seasoned. 
Our server was super nice and well be back!
