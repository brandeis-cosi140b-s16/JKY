I stopped in here after a long day of traveling with my husband and we were able to quickly get a table. The service was excellent- servers were all very friendly and accommodating. The chips and salsa were great- nice and spicy. My veggie tacos were good. Nothing spectacular but good sized portions. My husband loved the pork belly tacos. The margaritas were on the small size but were delicious. The star of our meal though had to be the table side king crab guacamole! It was FABULOUS! A definite must if you're a guac lover.
