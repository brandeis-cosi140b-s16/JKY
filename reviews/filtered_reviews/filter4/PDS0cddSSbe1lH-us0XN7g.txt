If you like Nachos then go here. You should take some friends because the plate is huge. We have gone here a few times and the food is good for the price. The $2.00 Margaritas are just that but they still get you drunk for a good price. This is a great place to meet up with friends and have a good inexpensive time. We have gone to other places and paid as much for a few drinks as drinks and a meal here.
