Ok let me start by saying we come here everytimewe are in town. We use to drive tothe phx location but this one is closer.   I would have given it 5 stars but the service is sometimes scektchy like they are doing you a favor by taking your order. Regardless we are slaves to their amazing black beans and jade red chicken quessidillas   So we keep coming back.  Often we order by phone as we are driving into town and get it to go thus avoiding the rude servers
