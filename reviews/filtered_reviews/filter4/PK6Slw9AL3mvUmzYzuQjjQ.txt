Great place to go for a birthday. They bring out a crew of employees as well as a musician with a guitar, and hand you a shot of tequila. The toreados with guacamole are amazing. We started off with some oysters as an appetizer and to my delight they came topped with ceviche. Good service and very friendly employees. Bar has a crazy amount of different tequilas.
