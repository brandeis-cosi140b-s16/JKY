This review is solely for their happy hour. Buy one get one free!! You get either the yard long margaritas or the 24 ounce palm tree margaritas and it's buy one get one free- all  night! I also wanted a jalapeno margarita, which they didn't have on the menu, and the bar tender went ahead and made it anyways and included it in the happy hour prices. Very nice of her. 
This place is NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY past 7 PM. But what place in Vegas is? The staff was drunk and the manager was a little creepy... the bouncer was telling me that the managers buy free shots for the girls that come in. Once again, not a surprise in Vegas. 
Good view! You can sit outside by the water and pirate ships. 
Overall, for the price, why not??
