By far one of my favorite salads I've had around town and I'm not even a salad kinda guy. I get a mix of the sweet pork and the shredded beef . It includes rice beans two dressings lettuce and pico. If I do the right thing I would share but I love it so much that I dont. I don't even get rice but it still filling but I do add the fresh hot salsa instead of pico on top. They have daily specials and I think Friday is fish taco and I have yet to have that. I do remember having the enchiladas and loving it. Whether you get tacos burritos enchiladas they make the tortillas fresh in house heat it up right behind and melt the cheese on it before filling it up.  A little bit more expensive than Chipotle a great choice when you wanna mix it up. Handful of food places in this strip but parkin usually isnt an issue. Lotsa of hot sauces in bottles and all the drinks that are not soda are amazing. My favorite is the mint lemonade. Its got a mojito kinda vibe and no one would judge if you chose to throw a few plastic bottles of rum in there(once you get home of course :) )
