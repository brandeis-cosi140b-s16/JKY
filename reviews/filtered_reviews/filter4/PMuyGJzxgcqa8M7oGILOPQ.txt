I give this place 4 1/2 stars-I would go five, but my five in the area is Los Dos Molinos for the way it covers all the bases with high quality, an egg on its open face enchiladas, and its serious spice. 

A wonderful "hole in the wall" Mexican food restaurant that my wife and I will definitely visit again-and would frequent regularly if we lived closer. First off, they have a very nice clean space that was smaller/hole in the wall, but was very clean, comfortable, and welcoming. On the plus side, they serve a great selection of beers and and also serve margaritas, which I believe really take good Mexican food to the highest level. The chips and salsa were great! Although I tend to like a little more spice-but no complaints. Very tasty and we finished them off. I had their carnitas combo plate that were probably the best carnitas I have ever had-delicious and very crispy. The dish included beans, rice, pico de gallo, some guacamole, and a huge moist tortilla that had been grilled and nicely charred. I tore through the entire dish and left nothing. Everything was marvelous, although my wife did not like the beans as much as she likes the beans at Los Taquitos over by Awatukee. While I love Los Taquitos, if this place was closer, I would probably go here first because I love a good beer with great Mexican food. 

A very nice touch to the meal was when the owner came over to chat with us to talk about the evolution of the restaurant. He also gave us a sample of the margarita, which I will have next time. A very nice man we wish continued success.
