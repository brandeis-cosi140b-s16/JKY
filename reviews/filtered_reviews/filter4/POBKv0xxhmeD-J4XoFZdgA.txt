We were driving through on our way to Salt Lake City and stumbled across Viva Zapatas.  It was a wonderful find.  It seems to be a big favourite of locals, as it was almost full on a Sunday at 11:00 am.

Chips were brought to the table with salsa and bean dip.  The chips are so fresh, no mistaking them for store bought, and the dips truly tasty (salsa was a bit spicy).  We had Huevos Machaca with corn tortillas, so much meat that it was hard to find the eggs.  It was very tasty but I would have enjoyed a little more pico de gallo to add some texture.  Definitely worth the detour off the I-15
