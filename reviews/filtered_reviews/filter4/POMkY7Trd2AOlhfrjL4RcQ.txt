I went here on a Friday after having a crappy day. I actually wanted to go to Cadillac Ranch, but they were charging cover. No thanks. San Felipe's it was. 

I had fun. But, maybe I just washed my sorrow's away by the music and alcohol. 

Plenty of people dancing... and plenty of people out sitting at the picnic tables. The biggest gripe I had was that for the entire place, there seemed to be two bartenders. While they did awesome, it would have been nicer to have one more for a place that was packed. Ya know?

I have had the food here before, but I can't really remember it. So all I can say is that I didn't die from it.
