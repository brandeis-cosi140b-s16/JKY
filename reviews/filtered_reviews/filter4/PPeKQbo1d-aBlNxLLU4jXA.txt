I rate this place 4.5 Stars.
  
A fun, lively atmosphere, solid food, and good service make this one of the better Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas. 
The food is delicious, seasoned and well prepared. 

I ordered the staple dish which is the fajitas, the flames was cool but I was more interested in how it tastes. 
The pork fajitas tasted excellent!! 
Succulent with a kick because I added jalapenos to it. 
The portion is enough for two people to eat and for $17 that's a bargain.
My friend got the chicharrones, I sampled a small amount and it was amazingly flavorful.

This place also great for happy hour, $5 margaritas and $3.50 for domestic beers. 

The staff was very friendly and went above and beyond to make the experience fun.

I'll definitely be coming back here.
