Here is the straight dope on Carolina's/Peoria:  If you are looking for super friendly service, keep looking. The service is inconsistent.  If you are looking for fast and competent, you will find it here most of the time.  

If you are looking for a perfect order every time, keep walking.  If you take the time to thoroughly check your order, you will be satisfied, but you cannot be afraid to speak up. Sometimes they undercook the tacos which makes them seem stale.  The salsa is improved.  The chips are good. The beans and rice are yummy. 

When it is super busy, you will not like most anything about it, but it is super busy because it is good food, so what do you want?  Also, they keep the AC on about 85 so be ready to sweat. 

Now, the cleanliness issue.  There is an issue with cleanliness in the front of the house.  The back of the house seems to be kept much cleaner. For this reason, I get my food to go. I do NOT order beverages. The machines seem very unkempt and not maintained. I get the heeby jeebies just thinking about the bacteria in the ice maker and drink machines.  

So that's my two cents.
