We are from Hawaii and stumbled upon Carlito's by accident after getting on the wrong freeway on ramp trying to go to another Mexican restaurant. Carlitos popped up on yelp as a nearby Mexican restaurant so sight unseen we decided to try it. Never heard of it before and didn't have time to read the reviews.  

We were absolutely blessed!  The counter gal was friendly, and the patrons obviously were regulars and as we stood in line, they shared with us what to order.  The comment we heard a lot was "everything is good!" and yes it was.  My chicken taco for $2.25 was so ono-licious (in Hawaiian that means broke-da-mouth good) and hubby's steak burrito was ono-ono-licious.  The sauce on the burrito was amazing.  

We will definitely come back again! Carlitos Burritos NO KAI OI!  (In Hawaiian that means VERY GOOD!!)
