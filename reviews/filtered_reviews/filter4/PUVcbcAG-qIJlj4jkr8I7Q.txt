My wife and I came here after she arrived from a late afternoon flight.  She was on east coast time, and was both tired and hungry.

The staff here was friendly and seated us quickly.  Our waiter was helpful, friendly, on point, and attentive.  The food and margarita's arrived in a timely fashion, and was very good.

We were both very happy with our meal.
