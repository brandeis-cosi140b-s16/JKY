Not ooc, but definitely Mexican food as it should be: inexpensive and delicious. Tried all four of their rolled tacos [chicken, steak, two diff types of pork] which were exactly what you'd expect from your prototypical place. There was very friendly service and they were quite prompt.  Luckily we missed out on the lunch rush, as it was Tuesday Taco Day [rolled tacos for $1] when we happened to arrive. The chicken chimi was the hero for the day, far surpassing the four different tacos we tried. Two house salsas available [green and red] that were good but not great. I'd definitely eat here again, but it isn't memorable enough to bring me in from out of the city
