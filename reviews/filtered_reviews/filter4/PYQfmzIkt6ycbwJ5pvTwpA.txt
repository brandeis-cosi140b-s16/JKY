Hidden little spot with great atmosphere. Only had appetizers, but awesome sauce! Queso is great, guacamole fresh as is salsa. Chips are homemade. We were there early afternoon - only patrons really. Staff was busing getting prepared so service wasn't great, but it's a spot you'd definitely return to again!
