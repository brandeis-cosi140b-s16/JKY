Now lets just say that I have most of the caf√© Rio recipes and I am very well versed in the way the food is prepared from beginning to end. However, Wahoo's was a real treat, Their food really captures the essence of Mexican seafood without all of the extra steps, its simple yet delicious. The only reason for the 4 stars is The food took a little longer then I expected and there was only one server working.
