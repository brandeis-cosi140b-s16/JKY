Was in Phoenix for a conference at the convention center.  No car, extreme heat, dead downtown.  This was across the street and one of two Mexican places in the area.  Had the naked chile relleno and the max limit (?) of two margaritas.  Chips and salsa were very good and different.  I suspect they used dried chiles.  The relleno was great.  Meat was tender, mushrooms and other veggies very flavorful.  Can't imagine why they feel a need to "limit" customers to two, but it was good.  Service was brusque but quick.
