This is by far my favorite of all the Lindo locations in town (and this is the original, where it all started)! There's no view and parking is obnoxiously limited, but the service is fast, the employees are friendly, and the food is yummy. 

This is where I come when I want to blow my low carb diet. The fresh made flour tortillas are so good that I usually end up eating several baskets -- and it is always worth it! The corn chips and salsa / bean dip are all super tasty too. The menu is large enough so there truly is something for everyone. This location does a big office lunch business because they have a great smaller portion lunch special menu, so expect crowds if you go during the workday. 

My go-to favorites here are the queso with peppers as an appetizer (simple yet always amazing), the Pollo Con Rajas Y Crema Estilo Stephania (chicken breast with mild roasted peppers and a yummy cream sauce), and tasty chicken fajitas. A true local Las Vegas gem.
