I came here to get dinner with my cousin. We showed up at 9:00 at night on a Saturday and the wait was an hour to an hour and a half for 2 people without a reservation. Luckily for us, I asked if they serve food at the bar to which the hostess answered yes. We found 2 seats at the bar immediately and were able to order food and drinks right away. The food was a little spicy for our tastes and not as good as the Javier's at Crystal Cove, but not bad overall. The bartenders were all very attentive and did a go job. I would recommend it if you are looking for a chill spot with good food.
