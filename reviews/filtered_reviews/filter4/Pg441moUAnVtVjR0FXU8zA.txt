We had a terrible experience at Nacho Daddy due to delayed service.  We had ordered a pitcher of margaritas that hadn't come out until after we had been served our food and asked the server three times. The bill came and the server said they had taken care of half the pitcher. My friend got upset and he said I didn't tell you I would take care of it with a very negative attitude. My friend got upset with his attitude and made a comment about how he didn't need a tip. He popped up out of nowhere and said that's fine. We don't need rude people here and don't need your service. My friend said she wanted the manager. Whitney came over and listened to our story and was very empathetic. She took the bill and came back and not only apologized, took care of the bill and gave a coupon to welcome us back. A very negative situation was resolved more than we ever could have imagine because of Whitney. Because of her we would be happy to return to Nacho Daddy.
