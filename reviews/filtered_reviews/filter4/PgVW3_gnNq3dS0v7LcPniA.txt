Very cool atmosphere, delicious fresh agua frescas, lots of menu choices, excellent service.  We had the mushroom loaded queso and it wasn't our favorite.  My carne asada sandwich was amazing however and my mom loved her shrimp enchilada.  Will definitely be returning to try more!  Looking forward to trying their plethora of tacos
