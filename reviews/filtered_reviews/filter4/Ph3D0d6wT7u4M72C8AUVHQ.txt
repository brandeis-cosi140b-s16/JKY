We only had 30 minutes to eat before my 7 PM poker tournament.. and miraculously we were able to get in/out in under 30. Impressive in itself. 

As many have said.. happy hour rocks. Petpeeve is that drinks are all 2-1 and mb there are only 2 of us dining and one likes beer and one likes margaritas.. kind of annoying I can't order myself 2 maragaritas (so I like to double fist!)! 1/2 off nearly all appetizers. Chicken nachos were good, not great. Rock shrimp ditto.. margaritas ditto.. oh and why don't you have the green dos equis, the brown one isn't nearly as good? 

Four stars instead of 3 because the service was pretty quick, and I can honestly say this is the best mexican I've had in Vegas thus far. Yes, better than Isla, or Viva, or Bonita... I'm nuts.. I like tex-mex. Also, an extra star for having a happy hour that's half way decent and lasts until 7 PM!
