LOVED the sangria here, made with tequila, and since I had about 4 glasses, I'm a little hazy on what the food tasted like haha but from what I remember, I had some type of appetizer platter with some great chicken quesadillas that had a yummy sauce, some type of shrimp that were weirdly seasoned, like Mexican shrimp scampi or something, wasn't a fan...and the weirdest app ever which was like a flauta or something filled with mushrooms - yucky. The chips, salsa, and guacamole were all just ok, nothing special but great stomach coaters for downing all that good sangria!
