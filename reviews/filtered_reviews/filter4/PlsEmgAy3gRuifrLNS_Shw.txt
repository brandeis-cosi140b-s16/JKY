After driving by this place several times and reading the reviews, my girlfriend and I decided to try this place last night.  It's definitely a little hole in the wall and what it doesn't deliver in ambience it sure makes up for in food.  We tried several items on the menu: chicken and fish tacos, shrimp burrito, memelita with chorizo and a campechano taco.  The burrito was flavorful and full of shrimp and rice.  My gf didn't share the chicken taco with me but said it was very good.  Tasty fish taco.  And the campechano was great, beef cooked with chroizo.  The big winner for me was the memlita, a disc of lightly cooked masa covered with black beans, some queso fresco and topped with the meat of your choice.  It was fanatastic and all that food plus a mexican coke for about 16 bucks.  We are definitely going back and actually have talked about going back today for lunch as a break in Christmas shopping.  It will be put on our regular rotation.
