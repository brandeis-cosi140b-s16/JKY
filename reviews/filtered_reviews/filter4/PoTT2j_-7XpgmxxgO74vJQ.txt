I decided to give Nacho Daddy another try. I had steak tacos this time. The food and service were very good. I would definitely eat here again. The only issue was that I thought the tacos should have more ingredients than just steak and cheese. I ordered sour cream and guacamole to put on them which made them quite tasty. The extra hot sauce was very good, too.
