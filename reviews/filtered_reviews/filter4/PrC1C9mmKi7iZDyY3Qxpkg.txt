I went here with my best friend a few weeks ago. The menu is small and the location is even smaller. As a U of I alumni, I have seen many businesses come and go through this location. It is nice to finally see a business that is showing signs of sticking around. The food is simple and delicious. The service is fast and friendly. No complaints and I will definitely be back.
