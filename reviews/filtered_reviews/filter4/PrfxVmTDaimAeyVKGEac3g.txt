Clean atmosphere and expensive tastes go hand in hand here as far as Mexican is concerned. I ordered the Drunken Chicken Nachos to cure my (eh-hem) drunkenness and to my surprise, the plain cheese, chicken and salsa had a mild spicy kick due to the perfectly cooked green bell peppers in the green tomatillo salsa.

At first sight I was EXTREMELY disappointed. Plain cheese with the chicken sprinkled over the top splashed with a 1/2 oz ladle of tomatillo salsa. 

At first bite I knew what I ordered was right!!! The explosion of the rich cheese and marinaded chicken along with the bell peppers on the salsa made up for the plain look. Lesson Learned: Do not judge a book by its cover!!!

It also helped that the Dos XX was from the tap and much more delicious than the Coronas everyone been drinking. The bartender was sweet and cute as hell!!!  :)
