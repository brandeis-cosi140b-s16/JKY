Along with a restaurant in Puerto Vallarta called  Pipi's (http://www.pipis.com.mx/), Cafe Rio has the best guacamole I have ever tasted. Super fresh and absolutely delicious. 

We also loved watching the tortillas being made freshly before our eyes. 

Please come to Seattle, Cafe Rio! You have the most authentic Mexican food I've had from a chain restaurant.
