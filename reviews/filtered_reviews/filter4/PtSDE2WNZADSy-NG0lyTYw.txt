This review is based off the food alone, we ate outside and never entered the building.  We ordered the Pulled Pork Nachos and the Enchilada Nachos. Both were amazing, and for the price you can't beat it. I also had the Mango Thai Basil Margarita.... Holy crap that was delicious. 
I will definitely be coming back for more.
