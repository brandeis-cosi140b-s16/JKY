I love me some good mexican food and this place delivered. A buddy of mine that is also a big fan and he now lives in Las Vegas highly recommended this place. I had the #17 lunch special which was a Carnitas plate with all the fixings for $10.25. The carnitas was cooked well and had great flavor. The chips and salsa where also good. If you're off the beaten path in Vegas stop on by.
