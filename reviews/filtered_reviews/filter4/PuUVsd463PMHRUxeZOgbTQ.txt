Every time I end up going to Casa Don Juan, which is pretty much every First Friday because they're right down the street from where I'm hanging, there is an encounter with a crazy person or two.  Sometimes the crazy people are in my group yakking on and on about riding sheep, sometimes they're in the form of a large, older woman showing us the tattoo on her breast.  And in case you were wondering, yes it involved a rose.  Because of this and this alone, this very mediocre place gets an extra star.  I loves me some crazies!

The food is OK.  It's not scary or anything, and when you've got a Friday night, beer fueled hunger on it can be damn fine.  It's better than Macayo's even though the waitresses share uniforms, I think.  The service is pretty universally crappy.  Maybe it's because I'm there on what has to be their busiest night of the month, but seriously, one should not have to wait 20 minutes for a check.  

I would like to kiss the man who brought a fellow diner a side of sour cream on a plate.  A few minutes later, he reached for what he thought was his napkin and got a surprise.  It gave me a different crazy to look at to distract me from that lady's boob.
