This place has really great authentic Mexico food, delicious fire roasted salsas, an excellent variety of tacos and top notch bartenders. The service was fast and efficient. I liked some of the taco combos they offered - especially the falafel taco - a great mix of Mexican and Middle Eastern flavors. So good. Too bad the decor feels like it's from 1990 and it's tucked away on the 2nd level of the Luxor in an area where they have to close by 11pm. Such a bad call since the food is much better than any other restaurant in the hotel  And for Vegas, the price is right - dinner for two with a drink each came to under $55 with tip.
