Honestly, due to its location I would have never walked into the front door of this place if it wasn't for other Yelpers. The interior has the feel of your grandma's kitchen with old laminate flooring and vinyl table covers. For the age of the space it's clean, but don't expect an overwhelming dining experience. What makes this place so n great though are the people. The extremely friendly staff members are fantastic. The food is pretty rockin' too. Being vegetarian limits me on my selections, so i was unable to try any of the fusion dishes. I did, however, have the cheese enchilada plate and for 5 bucks got three enchiladas, and heaping stacks of rice and beans. These were not the best or the worst enchiladas I had ever munched, but at 5 bucks they were an incredible deal and yummy. They also give chips, salsa and guacamole when you dine in and a cut up orange for desert. Overall, an interesting and cheap place that I'm sure would have been stellar if I still ate meat. In the words of Arnold, I'll be back!!
