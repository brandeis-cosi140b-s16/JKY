First of all...this is what a taco is supposed to be like! LOVE tj style tacos! It was so yummy! However, since I grew up in San Diego, I do feel that the Tacos El Gordo in Diego is better, but for out of California?! This place is pretty spot on, satisfied my need for tacos...

Spend your money here...it will taste better then some buffets (ahem Planet Hollywoods suck)

My fave is the Carne asada and the hubbys was the pork.
