This little place right off the Fremont Street Experience was really a surprise. Being from Texas I can seldom expect decent Mexican food  away from home in touristy locales. This was really great. Our party had the Enchillada De Pollo which is Pulled Chicken, Queso Fresco, Onions, Mole Poblano Sauce Service was great and the ambience relaxing amidst the craziness of Fremont street.  It's fairly easy to spot off of Fremont Street since there is a 7-foot tall pink neon monkey clinging to the rooftop.
