Kinda surprised at the low rates for this place.  This restaurant is actually REALLY good.  If you're looking for lots of delicious small bites... this is it.  
Came here with a bunch of friends.. and gotta say.. almost everything exceeded my expectations.  I can't remember everything we ordered... but here's a few highlights
Lamb Pot Stickers Stuck on You - REALLY really good.  delicate and delicious. 
Shrimp Won Ton - was good, not the best in the world .  But.. I had a hangover and this really hit the spot.  
Sui mai - not your typical dim sum sui mai... better.  
When Pigs Fly - Steamed pork buns.  delicious, perfectly cooked.

okay.. everything is a little pricey... but hey... its good.
