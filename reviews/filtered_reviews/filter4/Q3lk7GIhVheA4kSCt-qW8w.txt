We love this place. Their Green Pork Chile Nacho's are great and very filling.  Z'Tejas has a survey on your receipt  that will give you a free appetizer with the purchase of one entrée "if you complete it".  Due to this, we have not paid the $9 or whatever amount it is for the Nacho's or any appetizer in years!  We just keep going and turning in survey's.  The service is great.  I think the price is kind of high. . maybe by about $2 per entrée, but its good food and the free appetizer offsets the higher price.  Additionally, we've been going there for over 5 years and there's no change in their menu. The menu pretty much stays the same. They have special entree's once in a while, but would like to see new selections added to their menus.  Other than that we've tried almost everything on their menu and its all good. . Great salads too.    Suggestion:  order one salad and split it if your not that hungry. The salads are huge!
