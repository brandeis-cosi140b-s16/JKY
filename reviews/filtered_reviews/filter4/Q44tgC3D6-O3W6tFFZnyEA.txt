VERY RELIABLE AND CONSISTENT MEXICAN FOOD.

The true highlight is actually free; the house made flour chips.  Ask for the green salsa and if it's September ask for the Hatch green chile salsa.

Chimichangas are flavorful and shareable.  Here too get them smothered in the green salsa and have them put the retried beans inside.

For North Scottsdale, this place is a hit.  It is second place to The Mission in Old Town and even Ajo Als but I predict success by location alone.

The only "CON" I feel warrants a comment is the very dark and sleepy feel of the decor.  When I think Mexican, I envision fun.  A restaurant with few windows and dark walls pips that image upon entry.  But hey, isn't that what the bat is for?
