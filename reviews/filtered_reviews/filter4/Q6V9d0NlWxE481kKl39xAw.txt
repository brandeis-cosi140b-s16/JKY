We were looking for a new place to try and we decided on Baja Joe's.  We were surprised, it was a neat place.  Half bar with a live band and the other half mexican seafood restaurant.  The menu is in Spanish and English with pictures, that is always helpful.  The waitress was really nice and helpful.  We told her it was our first time and she recommended we try the yellow peppers wrapped in bacon, stuffed with shrimp appitizer, AWESOME!  I ordere the mixed fajitas, OK, a bit greasey. My husband order the fish tacos, GOOD.  I don't know what I was thinking, duh, I should've ordered seafood. Next visit I plan on ordering what everyone else ordered, the big clay pot with flames underneath, filled with seafood, looked GOOD! 
Looking forward to my return.
