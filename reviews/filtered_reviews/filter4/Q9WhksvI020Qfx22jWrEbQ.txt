I came here with Ken, Paolo, and Tricia for the Tamales and Brewskis UYE.  I guess I never realized that this was a bonafide full service restaurant.  This location is very spacious.  

They serve a ton of different Mexican food but we were here for the tamales.  You can get one tamale for $4, six tamales for $14.25, and a dozen for $19.95.  Huh? Definitely get a group together and go for the dozen.  They let you mix and match and they are so tasty.  

The drinks here are pretty cheap, too.  $8 for pretty large mixed drinks.  I highly recommend this place for groups.  Or get your tamales to go, and have a party at home!
