A co-worker had mentioned this place so we decided to check it out. It's pretty close to work, so we have been here both for lunch and dinner. We've tried numerous items off the menu, so I'll highlight what we liked the best.

- Guacamole Sol: avocado, mango, goat cheese, and pepitas. This is delicious but it's really unnecessary. Don't get me wrong - I love guacamole but the extras don't really add to it. I'd be fine with their Naked Guacamole. 
- Coconut Calamari: calamari steak with panko-breading and coconut. This is delicious! The calamari is huge and super tender. We've ordered this a few times. 
- Spicy Chicken & Bacon Salad: walnuts, avocado, cherry tomatoes... mmm. This salad was delicious! The chicken wasn't too spicy and it was very moist and tender. I'd definitely order this again. 
- Taco Vampiro: double tortilla stuffed with melted cheese and carne asada. Yum! Little overboard, honestly, who needs 2 tortillas that are stuffed with cheese? But really good. 
- Ensenada Style Fish Tacos: your basic fish tacos. We ordered the red rice with this and the red rice is delicious. It's flavorful - definitely not bland like some restaurant's rice. 
- Carnitas Street Tacos: the pork was super moist and tender. 

While waiting for your food, they bring out salsa, black bean dip, and chips. All are delicious. 

The location is pretty easy to get in and out of - as long as there is parking in the parking structure next door. Once you park, the actual restaurant is really close. We've never had to wait for a table, which is nice. The hostess and waiters are extremely nice and helpful. We'll definitely be back!
