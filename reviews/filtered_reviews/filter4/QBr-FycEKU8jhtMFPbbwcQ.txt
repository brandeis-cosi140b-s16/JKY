My husband and I stopped at Las Velas early on Sunday afternoon. We ran the Great Race that morning and had to celebrate by feeding our ravenous stomachs! I have been looking for a good, traditional Mexican restaurant ever since my old favorite--Nopalitos in Latrobe--changed to bar-only food. This place hit the spot.

The place was pretty bare, with only a few other couples eating. We sat towards the front of the restaurant by the windows overlooking Market Square. Such a pretty view. 

We immediately ordered the chips and queso and attached them as soon as the waitress set them on the table.  OMG were they heavenly. I am not above licking any bowl clean and the bowl of queso was no exception.

I ordered the Puerco en mole poblano and I received two heaping plates of pork smothered in a heavenly mol√© rojo sauce, pico de gallo, beans, lettuce and guacamole.  After gorging myself on chips and cheese, I was worried I wouldn't be able to enjoy a lot of my meal but I downed three tortillas with ease. I was still left with a TON of food so I took it home. There was no way I was leaving it. 

My husband ordered the Alambres Carne which had the most amazing pork and cheese. Even though I was about to explode, I couldn't stop picking it off his plate.

The food was incredible and very authentic. The service was pretty good expect it took a long time to get our food. I like to think it was because they were actually making everything rather than heating some frozen mixture up.  But the wait aside, it was a fantastic meal and I highly recommend it. Definitely get the chips and queso!!
