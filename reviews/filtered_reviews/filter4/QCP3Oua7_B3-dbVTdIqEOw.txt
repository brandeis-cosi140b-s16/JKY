Great food - starting with the chips and salsa. My wife loved the green tomatillo salsa and couldn't get enough.  We had Tortilla Soup and Chicken Tinga Empanadas as appetizers which were both excellent.  Our entrees were the Carnitas and the Beef Brisket Taquitos.  Both were excellent.  The guacamole was excellent as well.  The beans and rice were just ok.

The portions were generous, and the chips and salsa good, such that we didn't have any room for dessert.

With a drink each, an appetizer each, and an entree each the bill was around $90.  Not cheap, but it's Vegas on the strip.  :)
