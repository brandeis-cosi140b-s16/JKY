They LIE!  They told us that a pitcher of margaritas would serve about 8 glasses.  It served 16!!!  There were 4 of us, and one didn't drink tequila (she had yummy mojitos instead).  So the 3 of us were left to drink an entire water pitcher of margaritas.  Not that I'm complaining mind you.  

Not only are their drinks massive, but so are their portions.  We got the queso fundido and the ceviche.  Both yummy and both huge.  Then we each order entrees, when we could've easily ordered one and shared.  We had all of the taco plates and one taquitos.  The food was yummy and the best part was that you can take your liquor to go, which is exactly what we did.  Then we found ourselves a pai gow table at TI and sat our happy asses down for a round or 15 of poker.

Isn't Vegas wonderful?!
