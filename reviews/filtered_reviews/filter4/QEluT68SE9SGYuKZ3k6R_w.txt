Great mimosa special for women on Sunday for brunch. Unique menu options. Great atmospher and better service. My only compliant was that the restaurant was a bit warm. Could be becuase it was so hot outside but they should figure out how to cool the place down to a more comfortable temperature. I'll be back when the weather cools down.
