I've been hearing about this place for a while, finally got to try it out on Saturday for dinner.  We got there around 5 and got right in, but by the time we left there was a 20-30 minute wait, so get there early.  It was cold and rainy so we sat inside, but it has a huge patio that would be pretty nice on a warm sunny day.  I got a special recommended by the server which was a chile relleno with carne adovada, and a green corn tamale on the side.  Both were pretty awesome, the pork is super tender and melts in your mouth, and the chile was coated with egg batter, cheese and green chile sauce, tasty.  The tamale was soft and simple, just how they should be, again covered with the chile sauce and cheese.  My wife had the chicken enchiladas with blue corn tortillas in red sauce, topped with fried egg.  Never seen the egg on top before but it was really good, break the yolk and let it become part of the sauce.  The beans were pretty good and the rice has a good bite to it as well.  
   I also had a couple of margaritas, nothing special but plentiful, giant glasses.  The food defiantely had a little spice to it but nothing like i had expected after hearing everyone talk about it.  Maybe i just have a high tolerance for chiles.  
   The decor was pretty interesting as well.  Tons of chotchkies all over the walls and hanging from the ceiling.  There were actually two molinos though.  Cool place, lots of color and stuff to keep your eyes busy.
  All in all, great meal, good service, and entertaining environment. I will be back.
