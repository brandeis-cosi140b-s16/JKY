1. Local multi-generational restaurant. Everything made from scratch. I've never been disappointed with the food. Service starts with complementary fresh chips and salsa, hot or mild. 

2. Attentive, knowledgeable bartenders who are not pushy. 

3. This is a Mexican restaurant. If you insist on vodka or whiskey based drinks, you'll get them, but every bottle you see displayed behind the bar is tequila. Plus a decent set of domestic and Mexican beers on tap.

4. Try the soups as the weather turns cool: albondiga soup and a very zippy vegetable soup with big chunks of potato and chili slices.
