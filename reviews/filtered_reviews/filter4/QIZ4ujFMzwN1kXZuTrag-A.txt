Before I moved to Chicago I asked the waitress for her phone number. She was cute and had the punk rock getup. She had a boyfriend. I came back two years later and she was still working there.  She remembered me, I asked her what's new and she said it was her last week, she got engaged and got a masseuse license.

Freshman year I ordered buffallo wings (when I still ate meat). They asked me "mild, wild, or insane". I said insane. It was so hot my nose started sweating.

Dates Worthy Place?
It's a great place to take a date because it's loud! 
If you like the girl (or boy) you have to lean in close to talk. 
Nothing says "i love you" like burrito and hot wings, unless she's vegetarian, then stick to the chickpea chilli burrito.
