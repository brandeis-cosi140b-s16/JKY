I love this spot; it is awesome. The tacos were amazing and their homemade nachos and salsa were amazing as well. I went for my birthday lunch recently with some colleagues and I will be back for their happy hour. THey have some great drinks specials and food specials listed. 

THe ambiance  of the Taco Guild is awesome as well. They converted an old historic church into an amazing bar and restaurant with some of the original stained glass and chandeliers and art.

I will be back soon!!!
