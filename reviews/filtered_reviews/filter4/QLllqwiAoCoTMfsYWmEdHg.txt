Happy Hour!!!
We went for Happy Hour specials, how can you turn down a $10 bucket of sangria?! They also have half off some appetizers and other drink specials.

We sat outside on the patio, perfectly protected from the wind and since it's on the second floor there were no screaming kids and shoppers right next to us. It's nice to get a little drunk in peace right?

Great fast service, food came a little too close to appetizer but it was slow and we did order all at once. Food is 4/5. Come for the drinks and appetizers mainly. It is a little spendy but what can you expect in Vegas? It was appropriate pricing for the venue & location. 

I will for sure be back again for a nice cold drink!
