You had me at Queso Dip...

Obviously I love their Queso.  It has such a rich and delicious flavor.  I could live off of that alone.  Enough about Queso... They have other good food.  Their grilled chicken salad is awesome! So huge and so filling.   The tortillas are all made there in the restaurant. They definitely compliment every meal they are included with.    -and yes the salad is also in a large tortilla.  

The service here has always been consistent with a  very friendly staff.  They are helpful and accommodating to your choices and options.   

Parking here is a bit cramped in the front and side.  There is always additional parking in back by Total Wine.  But it's obviously easy to find being located right off of Stephanie and Warm Springs.  

I'll be back for more very soon!
