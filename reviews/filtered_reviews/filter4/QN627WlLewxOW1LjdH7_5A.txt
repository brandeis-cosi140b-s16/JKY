Authentic, affordable and very good. The only thing that I don't like is the way they have the lines setup but oh well, the quality makes up for what this place lacks in service. The quality is over the top in so many ways. The drive through doesn't work but oh well, this is more of a lunch place rather than a dinner place but we do go there for dinner fairly often.
