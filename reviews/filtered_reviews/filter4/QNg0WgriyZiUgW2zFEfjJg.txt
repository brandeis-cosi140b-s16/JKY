My husband and I took our daughters here for dinner last night.  It was the second visit for me and my husband and the first for our two little girls. The first visit was underwhelming to say the least.  My nachos had way too many toppings and not enough chips to scoop them all up.  I do not remember my drink because it was just average.  I returned reluctantly because my husband had a coupon (which he could not find when it came time to pay, lol!).  Our second visit was a completely different experience.  I ordered the fiesta chicken nachos and a frozen raspberry margarita for myself and our girls split a cheese quesadilla.  The nachos were awesome and I did enjoy the margarita although I do not believe it was worth the $10 price tag.  I took away one star because when I took my daughter to the restroom it was sweltering in there, and I actually broke a sweat!  It is the end of June in Vegas; turn the freaking air on!  Other than the small problem with the air conditioning everything was acceptable.  I really enjoyed the nachos and our girls loved the quesadilla.  I will return to this place, but I probably will not order another margarita unless they have a happy hour offering.
