Been here a couple times for tapas and it's always been a pretty good experience. Last night we had the seared scallops, padron Peppers, pil pil shrimp, chicken skewers, calamari, and the lava cake. 

Everything is well prepared but I did not care for the chicken skewers because it was not white meat. However, the lava cake is definitely worth the 15 mins wait. 

Btw there's a groupon right now so don't miss out!
