I went to Las Vegas only for two days since I have came from LA where the people used to tell me that I have could found the best Mexican food there and after a fail I didn't given up and I decided to try in Las Vegas . I didn't regret the tacos are really good I had the carne asada and it was really good I was amazed by the flavor it was the same flavor as you could find it in Mexico , tha taco al pastor was seasoning quite well but the pineapple needed to be a little more cook on the grilled and the last the taco of carnitas not so good
