We happen to be here on a warm October (yes, I said warm! lol) visiting our son and baby cousin in college.  The surf shack in the middle of a desert will catch your eye immediately!  I love all the memorabilia.  The staff was awesome.  Very friendly.

It was warm and sitting outside in the heat with not even a slight breeze made it a rough first time experience.  

I don't know if their fridge was down, but we were served slightly cooled canned sodas out of a cooler and the salsa that came out of the little soda fridge on the counter was starting to turn. It kept exploding out of the mustard squirter container.  

The food was on point.  The tacos and burgers were good, but we couldn't fully enjoy it because we were sitting there sweating.

If you don't sitting outside in the heat, you'll get the most out of your Two Hippies experience if you visit in the Phx winter (which I plan on doing next week).  

All in all though, good food, chill atmosphere.  I'd definitely go back.  Just not when its hot. lol
