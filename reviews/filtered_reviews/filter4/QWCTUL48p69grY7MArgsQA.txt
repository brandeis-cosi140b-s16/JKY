This is a great spot to have some tex-mex nom noms. The corn salsa is pretty solid and I have yet to go wrong ordering different things off the menu. Obviously the fish tacos are a signature item, the carne asada wraps/tacos are damn good too. For the side I'm a fan of the jalapeno mashed potatoes "mashers". Atmosphere is very casual and laid back, this place is in the heart of NoDa (art district) so don't be surprised when your waitress named Cobra comes to your table tatted up and in hipster attire, because they all still provide great service. I'd recommend this place to anyone. It does have a tendency to fill up so whether you're doing lunch or dinner you may want to leave a few minutes early.
