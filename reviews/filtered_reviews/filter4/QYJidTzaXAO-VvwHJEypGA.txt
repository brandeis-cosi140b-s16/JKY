RuRu's has awesome outdoor seating. If it's not raining, that's where I want to be seated. The whole area out there is just so pleasant, especially at night. It would be a great place to take a date. The inside seating is adequate, but go for the outdoor if given a choice.

If you like fancy drinks they have you covered. If you're a beer lover they don't really hold a candle to all of the places in Charlotte to get fine beer. One of my favorite drinks is the "You talkin' to me?" jalapeno margarita (better than Paco's). 

Food-wise they have a pretty nice menu, a little short on veg options but it always tastes great and that's what matters. I usually get the "That's not snowflake" tacos with chipotle vinaigrette instead of the chipotle sauce (the sauce has cream in it). If I'm in the mood for eating a lot of food the "You Got No Legs, Lt. Dan" fills the belly quite nicely. Also, to there credit, they actually know how to cook tofu, which is rare for non-Asian places.

I definitely recommend trying out RuRu's. Get a seat outdoors if you can!
