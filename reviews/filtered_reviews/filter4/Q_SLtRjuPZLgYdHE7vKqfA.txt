Really good service as well as dishes and drinks at Happy HOur. The staff was extremely nice and helpful; moreover, very patient with us. 
Dish: Chile Relleno -- Yes, 6/10 for a good solid dish
Drink: Bloody Mary -- 4/10, its alright... I'll pass
Fast and decent food. I would come here if I was hungry in the area. 
Pros: Quality and staff
Cons: Price for dishes are a little on the high side.
