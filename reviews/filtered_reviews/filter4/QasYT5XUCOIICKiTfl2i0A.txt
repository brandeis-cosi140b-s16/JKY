I tried one of each Taco (chicken, birria, and carne asada). The chicken & carne tacos were awesome, however I wasn't the biggest fan of the Birria taco. Use the check in offer and get free chips & salsa, definitely a plus! Finally, don't forget to get a Mexican coke, they're the best of you like Coca-Cola!
