Loved this place! Just north of Encore on Las Vegas Blvd, it was a cheap $6 cab fare from The Mirage, (ten minute walk back afterwards) The Tacos were out of this world fresh. Meat sliced right into the tortilla from the spinning rotisserie of spicy pork or beef. Topped with fresh homemade salsas, cilantro and onion. The small but comfortable outdoor patio was perfect for the sunny day. We only wish we had gone sooner, not on our last day before heading home! Delicious, and only $2 a taco is a steal so close to the strip. Most delicous and cheapest meal you will find.
