The hunny and I dined here on Halloween!  We were on our way to meet friends and wanted to start our night with a little "us" time.

We were seated on the patio which has a nice view.  The restaurant itself is chic and modern.  The patio tables for 2 are super small!!  More like a cocktail table not really for dinner.  We started with the guacamole and margaritas which can't really go wrong!  Nice chunky avocado and not too heavy on cilantro.  We also got 3 pork tacos and some sort of steak.  Both dishes were spicy but subtle.  I think the chef used chili oil to get the slower lingering of spice.  Yum!

This is delicious but a little pricy for the small portions- though obviously I enjoyed it very much.
