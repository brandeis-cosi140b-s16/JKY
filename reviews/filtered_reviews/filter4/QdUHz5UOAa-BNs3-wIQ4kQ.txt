First of all, Nando's has great chips.  The salsas that they serve with the chips are good-not great.  And yes, this is Tex-Mex food people-so its not "real Mexican food"- big deal.

The entrees are huge, especially the fajitas.  I have been here around 6 times and I've particularly enjoyed the Mesquite Tacos and the Sonoran Enchilada.  Even my father enjoys his "Gringo Burger."

On some occasions, it has been noisy.  Wait staff has been friendly all the times I have been there.  Recommended.
