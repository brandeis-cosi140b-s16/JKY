Great place if you love Mexican food. I went in just before the restaurant part was close. The decor is cozy and welcoming. Our waitress was a very nice lady by the name of Marissa.  She was super friendly. I ordered a burrito and my girlfriend order the tostadas. The flavors blended well in my burrito. It was evenly seasoned and down right good.  For my girlfriend plate, she was overly pleased with the predation of it. I had a bite of her tostadas and it was good.  However, the taste of the pork in it was a little over powering for me. But still, it was good.  Highly recommend this place.  They're open 24/7 with the restaurant side closing at 11. They also have a live band that plays Tuesday's and Saturdays. 2 up for this place.
