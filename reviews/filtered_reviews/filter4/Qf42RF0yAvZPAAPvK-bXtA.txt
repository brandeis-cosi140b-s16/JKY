stopped in here with rents as it has became a staple for them. Very good food they have flour and corn chips personally my favorite Is the flour chips. Also got a chicken chimichanga I think the spelling is correct lol anyways. They offer 2 sizes large and larger I think it was a pound and half a pound. Trust me a half a pound is all you need. Verry good food quality. The sound on a wed was not bad. I expect some noise on the weekends. Verry fast service from server to kitchen and kitchen to server took about 15 max 20 mins for our food to get there. They are opening a new one near market street kitchen in the d.c. ranch area maybe higher end stuff skirt steaks idk. but sounds good. Will be back.
