The food is delicious, the service was grand and very attentive, and the decor is delightful. It really is a pretty restaurant. They have the best Churros with Carmel dipping sauce. I ate a lot of them in Spain and it is hard to find good ones here. A suggestion would be to offer a deep dipping chocolate option too. 

I read the two bad reviews and have no idea what that is all about. They were all over us with great service and the only other restaurant with as good street tacos and such is Gallo Blanco. I did not try the chips or Guacamole. I might have to go back if it is as good as others say.
