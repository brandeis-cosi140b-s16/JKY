I didn't give it a 5 because it's not a 5 star restaurant but it certainly is a 4. 

I went with my family and we all were happy with our food, and that hasn't happened in quite awhile. One of us always gets "the bad plate of food". Not here. We got there at happy hour, 99 cent margaritas. Heck yeah.
Hubby ordered Hatch Chile Cheese Crisp, that could have feed all of us, end of story. It was delicious, the green chili had such a great taste not bitter at all and just the right amount of heat. 

Here is the dinner line up...
Hatch Chile Relleno. Awesome taste, not very spicy though.
  
Bandera Enchiladas. OMG Fantastic. Enchilada with red, green and  spicy queso fundido. The chicken was seasoned well, I could have just eaten that but what fun would that be.
  
Flaming Arriba Fajitas. Delicious! It was nice to get fajitas and not have it mainly grilled onions. This had a good portion of steak and grilled onions and green bell peppers. The tortillas were nice and fluffy. Came with the fixing of  guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo. Their guac is...yummy!

All 3 dinners came with beans and rice which I could have made a meal of. The dinners were huge and could easily be shared.

Lastly service. our waitress was very nice. She was exactly how I like to be waited on, answered questions about the food, took our order, brought drinks, food, checked if everything was good, cleared plates BEFORE bringing the bill, didn't hover around which I find annoying. I wish I could remember her name because she really did a nice job.

We will definitely be back.
