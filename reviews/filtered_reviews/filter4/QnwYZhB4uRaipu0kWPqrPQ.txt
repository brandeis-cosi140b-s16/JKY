This place comes with great expectations due to the favorable press it receives. The neighborhood is a little dicey and finding a park was a challenge (it's in back) but once inside a saw a small bar area and a cozy dining room with most tables filled during the lunch hour.
We scored a table and ordered the table side guacamole dish that most of the diners went with. The menu is not your standard Mexican fare, so fewer options than you may be used to. I went with chile Colorado with was very good.
I would like to come back and try it for dinner.
