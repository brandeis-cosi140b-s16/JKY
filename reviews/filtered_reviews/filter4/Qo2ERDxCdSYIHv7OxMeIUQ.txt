Off work an hour early and want to hang out?  Hip little open-air Mexican joint, is a solid choice.  Clean, fun, patio vibe with great beer pitcher prices and good beer on tap. If you're going for just food, you can do a lot better.  If you're intent is to unwind and graze, very solid choice. Did I mention their happy hour beer prices are awesome?
