The food here is pretty authentic and portions are way large. Prices justified. It's best to go after 1:30 on the weekends when the lunch crowd thins a bit. You can get Tex-Mex faves like chimichangas, or carne asada soft tacos. Overall it's worth the price. I agree it's great to dine outside when temp is below 100.
