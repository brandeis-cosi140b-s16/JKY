Great little place in Mesa! They cook their meats right up front behind the cashiers, so the smoke gets a little much at times, but they keep it ventilated as best as they can. Decent prices, meat taste really good, great refried beans and yummy salsa. Over all 4 1/2 stars. Make sure you stop by between normal lunch and dinner times because it gets pretty busy!
