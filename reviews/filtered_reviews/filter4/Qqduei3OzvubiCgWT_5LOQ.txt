Salsa was delicious. Cheese dip was really good too. I had the shredded chicken tacos which were pretty tasty and my boyfriend had the chicken quesadilla which he gobbled up (it was also massive).  Only negative is that it is a bit pricy for mexican food-but it was delicious with large portions (and fresh food) so it didn't bother us too much!
