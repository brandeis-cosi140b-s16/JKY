I'll get the negatives out of the way. The service was on the slow side, and the waiter was inattentive. The drinks were good, but a little too expensive.

That being said, the food was amazing. We come from an area where there simply is not food like this, and we loved it. My girlfriend got the beef burro. She was warned of spice, but could have handled more. Still, the flavor was delicious. I got the adovada ribs. They were quite spicy with full-bodied flavor. The guacamole was simple, maybe only avocado and garlic, but so fresh, we devoured it. For Northerners craving good Southwestern food, this is worth the visit.
