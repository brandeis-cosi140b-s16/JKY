On our first night in Scottsdale, we asked the concierge for something new in town. The Mission in Old Town Scottsdale, was a hit. The physical plant was adobe style. Inside had soft lighting, contemporary upbeat music and a great spanish feel complete with lots of candles, metal forgings and the liike. The drinks were great and the food was outstanding. We started with skewered chicken and beef satay and they were savory, tender and perfect to the taste.. The Duck Carnitas Empanada ($12) was also a great way to start. Whether you do tapas or a full meal, there is plenty to choose from. Some of my favorites were the Malbec Braised Short Ribs ($19) and Scallops ($28). Best side was Creamy Grits $(8) with butter, honey and chipotle.

Dont forget dessert and the tequila bar!
