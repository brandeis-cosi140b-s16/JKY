Are you hungry? 
Is it 1AM?
Do you have $4?
If you answered yes to any of these questions, drive to Tacos El Gordo immediately.

The first thing you'll see is a massive rotating tower of succulent pork.

Next to the pork is a friendly gentleman wielding a sword-sized knife.

They carve the meat into fresh tortillas while you order. 

All the ingredients seem fresh and unprocessed.

If you're looking to get as fat as possible, get a half-order of "campenchana fries."

If you're staying fit, just get a couple of tacos. I estimate them at around 250 calories each, and you'll feel extremely satisfied for $4.

Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because they don't really have a signature vegan/vegetarian selection to write home about. 

Several of my friends are vegan/vegetarian, and that means I can't go here as often as I'd like, because there aren't any truly delicious options for them.

But I'm an omnivore and Tacos El Gordo is still the best taco joint I've ever been to!
