Every time I go to Phoenix I make a point of visiting Frank & Lupe's. The food is excellent, the service friendly and the atmosphere relaxed and fun. It isn't high cuisine, but it doesn't pretend to be and it doesn't need to be! 

We always start off with the margaritas that nicely straddle the line between weak and WHOA TOO MUCH. The standard chips and salsa are on the table in minutes, the salsa also hitting the sweet spot of not too hot and not too bland. The guacamole is amazing. 

If you're looking for an enjoyable meal in a nice location -- smack in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale's shops and galleries -- you really can't go wrong.
