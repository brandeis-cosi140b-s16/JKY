Love this authentic Mexican restaurant. Its situated below their market, however once you are downstairs you would never know. The atmosphere is very inviting. 
I have visited several times, both with the entire family and sometimes with just my wife and I. 
Communicating can sometimes be a challenge, but it's all part of the experience. 
We love their margaritas and have tried several dishes on the menu.  While none disappointed I like the Casa Reyna Burritos the best.  
If you like authentic Mexican food it is definitely worth a trip to decide for yourself.
