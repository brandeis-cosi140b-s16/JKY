Originally we were planning to go to Cowfish for lunch which is right next door but then we decided to venture out and go with Chuy. We were greeted  and seated immediately. As you walk in you'll noticed a mixture of 50's diner furniture, some fun paintings, patio lights and Mexican mosaic tile patterns. What really makes it stand out to me though is the tortilla station. Literally someone was making fresh tortilla for your meal. The results of the freshly made tortilla? Superb. The salsa tasted so fresh and the flavors were great. I thought it was a bit on the salty side but still delicious. 

I was a little disappointed that they do not serve my favorite Mexican drink. Horchata! It is a refreshing cold drink made of rice, almonds, cinnamon, lime zest and sugar. Even though the drink has a milky appearance it is completely dairy-free. At least the manager or owner came out and apologize. She wish she knew the ingredients so they could provide that to customers who knows their stuff. ;) I was starting to think there wasn't any great Mexican restaurants around the Charlotte area. Then this place said "No Wendy, come to us and we will change your mind..."  and guess what? It did. (for some reason I just read that like the voice of Jack Black from Nacho Libre) Anyways, enjoy!
