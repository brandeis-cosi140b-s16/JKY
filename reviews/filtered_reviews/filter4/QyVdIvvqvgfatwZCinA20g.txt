One of my favs for more casual dining in Vegas, decent mexican food and gotta love the name LOL. We usually try to make it a lunch destination on every trip, it's also good for a quick dinner if you are staying at the Hard Rock however if given the choice I prefer finer dining establisments for my dinners when I am in Vegas which now seems to be the dining capital of the world. As others have mentioned their chips are great, very light and the salt sticks to them in perfect amounts(important LOL). Everything on the menu is great however my fav is their enchiladas, the sauce is oh so yummy.
