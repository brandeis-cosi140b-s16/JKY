One of the very few restaurants in Phoenix that has pleased me. The margaritas are tasty and strong, the tacos are quite delish, and our server Laura was a sweetie pie and attentive. My only complaint: We all thought is was pretty disgusting that there are no doors covering doorways to the bathrooms. Yes, you don't walk directly into the bathroom, but when you are sitting anywhere near the open doorways, which lead to a tiled "bathroom looking" area, it can be enough to turn your stomach. Why not cease the opportunity to place another beautiful and creative piece of woodwork? Come on, Mr. Fox.
