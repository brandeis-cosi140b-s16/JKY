The way that I found out about SumoMaya is because I live in the same Luxe condo complex as the chef, Herb Wilson. We met a couple of times around our grounds and have had conversations in which he had shared with me about his new restaurant in north Scottsdale and extended an invitation to visit. I took him up on it last Friday and I have to say that I am very impressed! The atmosphere, the music, the design and decor, the service and the food were all excellent! I am typically not into fusion type restaurants, however, in this case, because it's only working with and fusing 2 amazing types of cuisine flavors - it works! I highly  recommend that you visit, experience and enjoy the establishment of SumoMaya. You will absolutely be happy that you did and want to return again and again!  Enjoy and cheers!
