This is my GO-TO spot after any event I go to at the Time Warner Cable Arena. I went to the Knicks - Hornets game on Saturday night and after the game was over and I was many beers into the night, I decided that I was in the mood for some Mexican food. (I always leave TWC arena in the mood for Mexican.) Why is that? Because it's probably one of the closest places that I can walk to haha. 

I always order the same thing. Dos Equis Lager, the Queso Dip, and their combo #1. Food wise, I would give this place a 3...maybe 3.5 -- Will it be the best Mexican food you've ever had? Absolutely not. However, does it have an awesome ambiance, great d√©cor and is it conveniently located? YES, YES, and YES. 

I have only sat at the bar when I have come here. All the bartenders I've had are excellent and the food gets out to me pretty fast. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a solid bite to eat.
