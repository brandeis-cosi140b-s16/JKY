I come here weekly for our taco Tuesday nights. The carne preparada is lean and tasty. Just put on the grill and serve.
You can't go wrong with the freshly made corn and flour tortillas. I've even bought their salsas and creamy guacamole. Their vegetables are fresh and cheap!
We fed a party of 25 for less than $60. It was a huge taco fest at our house and everyone raved of all the yummy flavor.
Thank you Ranch Market!
