First off, you need to know that Friday and Saturday nights are busy so you need to be prepared for a wait. Also, the environment on these nights is festive and loud. Personally I don't think it's a good place for group events. 

The quality of the food was high. The carne asada, salsas, house made tortillas etc. were all very tasty. 

We were both impressed that when an error was made and someone took a special ordered item to the wrong table, thus causing a meal to be deliver late, they were obviously very concerned. We had 3 people come to the table to apologize and the manager (I believe) came by to tell us that they'd taken that item off our Bill (without us complaining or asking for it). That obvious concern and care for patrons goes a long way. 

The food alone is worth coming here for. The obvious pride of ownership and care for customers makes them even more impressive.
