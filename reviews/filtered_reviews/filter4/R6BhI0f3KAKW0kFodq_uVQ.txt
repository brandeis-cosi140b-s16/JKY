Great Happy Hour specials. $3, $4, and $5 happy hour, can't beat that for the prices and we enjoyed the views, service staff, and mostly all the food and drinks. We has the chicken flautas (so freaking yummy that we ordered 3 of those!) the avocado rolls (those were just ok - the bacon over-powered the entire dish that you couldn't taste anything else..granted bacon is great but you lose the taste of the grilled chicken, avocado, and other spices) we also had the baby back ribs (good but not great, the bbq sauce could've been better) the sangria was delis and so was the margarita. we also ordered the carne asada fries (very yummy) and carne asada tacos (this wasn't on the happy hour menu but very good.
