There are plenty of dining options in downtown Scottsdale area.  The Mission outshines the competitions with quality food and welcoming atmosphere.  There was a big crowd, and we waited about 45 minutes without reservation.  Overall, this place put out some of the best Latin inspired dishes.

Duck Carnitas Empanda
The flavor combination worked well, but it was difficult to discern foie gras as one of the ingredients.   

Pork Shoulder
It was tender and flavorful with soft tortillas.  I like the presentation with the tortillas layered on top of the salt block.  I don't think the salt block did much flavor wise, and the tortillas weren't too salty because of it.

Fried Bananas 
The bananas weren't too mushy inside, and the exterior had nice delicate crunch.
