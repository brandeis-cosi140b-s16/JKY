Great tacos at a good price.  I can count on all my kids showing up at my house if they get wind that we're doing Taco Tuesday!  My entire family loves both the beef and chicken tacos and the variety of salsas and hot sauces in their salsa bar!  Just know that the tacos are somewhat small so plan on 3-4 per person.  Another thing that we learned is that the garnish is cabbage rather than lettuce, so be sure to order without if anyone in your family is sensitive to cabbage.
