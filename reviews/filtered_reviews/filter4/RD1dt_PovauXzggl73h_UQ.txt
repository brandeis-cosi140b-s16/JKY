Yes, I'm a fan. Bar food can be hit or miss in this city and I think Nacho Daddy is above par on their drinking & dining experience.

I do not live very close to henderson, which is GREAT for my waistline because if I did - I'd be here every week.

The first time i went to Nacho Daddy was for brunch on sunday with my husband and we ordered the bacon & egg nachos. What an AWESOME concept - eggs on nachos!! The house made flour chips are thick, crispy and oh-so tasty!  The entire entree was the perfect ratio of crunch, gooey cheese, fluffy eggs, and tasty bacon.

I have also had the buffalo chicken nachos (subbed the chips for the flour chips because they're awesome), Nacho Average Burger Nachos, the spicy shrimp nachos, and the hubby ordered the country fried steak nachos and the BBQ chicken nachos.

While a fan of the buffalo chicken the others were good but not AS good. Hubby liked the C.F. Steak nachos (not for me - I'm not a fan of the gravy) but said the BBQ chicken nachos had a tang to it that he wasn't excited about.

BUT it's the bacon & egg nachos that we keep coming back for. They are only available on the brunch menu (which I believe is now available 7 days a week 9-2??) but they are definitely worth driving 11 miles for.

The service is great, the atmosphere is awesome and I really like the layout and the outside patio. If I lived closer this would definitely be a place I'd watch the morning football games. 

My husband and I said we would try to go at least 1x a month. It's pretty darn good!
