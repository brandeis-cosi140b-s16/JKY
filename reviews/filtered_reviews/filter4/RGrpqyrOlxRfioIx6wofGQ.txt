We came in during happy hour for some drinks and appetizers. Christina was our server and she was incredible. So personable and funny. She was legit. I'd come back just because of her service! We ordered nachos and margaritas. The nachos were sooo big and delish. I totally recommend coming here for happy hour. Just make sure you ask for Christina!
