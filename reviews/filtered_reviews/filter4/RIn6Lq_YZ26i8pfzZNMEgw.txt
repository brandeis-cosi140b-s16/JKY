This dining experience was amazing! We came here for lunch and weren't really expecting much as we were just wandering around trying to find a place to eat within the Cosmo. We stumbled across this place which is a little hard to find and were pleasantly surprised. The ambiance was so unique. Sort of asian/hipster combination. There are bike wheels on the ceilings and pictures of monumental figures on the wall that change with time. There are two bar areas to sit and order food or drinks.

There is an amazing place to wait if there is no room immediately for a table. It is really unique!!! The food was excellent and so diverse. I loved the chinese/mexican fusion. We ordered the langosta taco's, vegetable spring rolls, chips & salsa (seasoned so well), vegetable jaiozi dumplings (dim sum), my fiance had the chicken lettuce wraps, and we split the churros. The churros come with a chocolate milk sort of dip it's not solely chocolate. I wish they served it with just chocolate as traditional churros are typically serviced with. They were also a little too sugary. I also wish that they had more dipping sauces. They only have soy sauces. I don't like soy sauce so I was hoping they would have a lighter sauce or some type of orange sauce but they did not have it. They also do not have coffee. If they work out some of those issues, this is a 5 star restaurant :)

All and all we will definitely dine here. We really enjoyed it for lunch although it can get quite busy. Make a reservation or pop in and sit in the cool waiting area. This is a great lunch option at the cosmo! For dinner I'm sure that it is probably a different scene and I'm not sure what that may be! We will definitely check it out next time.
