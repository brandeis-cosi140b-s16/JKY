I come here once every few months and i can honestly say i have never been disappointed and i always leave happy. 

This is Tex-Mex, they have nothing that is authentic Mexican food, so if that what your are looking for you wont find it here go to Reyna's in the Strip.  That being said as far as cheaper tex mex food, i am a fan.

The service is usually good, nice enough atmosphere, especially in the summer when u can sit outside.  Great drink specials around happy hour

I almost always get the fajita and it is really good( not that it is that hard to do) but they don't mess it up.  Things are reasonably priced and and it comes out pretty quick.

Guac is meh, stick with the free chips and salsa or get the queso
