This was a great find! Conveniently (depending on your perspective) located next to Sapphires gentleman's club, El Dorado Cantina serves very fresh, very tasty Mexican food at a reasonable price point. 

The service was friendly, although there was a bit of a mixup regarding who had taken our drink order and the delivery of said beverages. 

The chips and salsa were fine, nothing too remarkable, and served with 3 different types of salsa. The hottest sauce had a lot of heat, but not tons of flavor. The others were good, but nothing special. 

I ordered the shrimp tacquitos, which were a good portion size, and filled with lots of shrimp. One standout was the guacamole, which was some of the best i have had, and there was lots of it. 

My favorite part of the meal was dessert! Thanks to my Yelp check in, we received a free order of churros. They were amazing. They had a banana filling inside and the dipping sauces were the perfect complement.

I would definitely return- and maybe next time I will stop by and visit the ladies next door!
