This is one of Scottsdale's new hot spots. If you like the 'Scottsdale' scene, this place is a must. Sunday the music goes off as Thomas James spins sic house beats and the bar serves up $2 tacos. On the weekends, it is still the hot new local spot so it is always busy. Fun place to go and usually there is great eye candy.
