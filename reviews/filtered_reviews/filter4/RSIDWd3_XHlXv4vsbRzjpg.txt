Thanks Yelp for another good find.  Small little strip mall place but the food is full if flavor.  Lots of options and the owners were there to gives us some advice on what to try.  I had the three soft tacos with all three types of chicken, very good.  My wife had the four street tacos, variety of meats and she really liked them.  Good prices, good food, great service.
