Deb K took me and fellow co-workers here. The sala and chips were great. Great service, good beer, and its clean too. What? The mini chimis were pretty good, but I only had two b/c the salsa and chips were SO good. They even served us chips and salsa before they knew for sure if we were gonna order something besides beer. 
The mini chimis were an appitizer, but even 4 of us couldn't finish them! Go Mi Patio.
