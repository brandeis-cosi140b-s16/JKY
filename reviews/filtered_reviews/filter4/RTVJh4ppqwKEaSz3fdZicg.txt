Hot and fresh food.  Love this place.  For a 'fast food' type place...this beats most Mexican Food Restaurants around Scottsdale.  My family have been here several times, as it has become a favorite, and we've always had a nice experience.  Beans and rice always are fresh and hot.  The Chicken taquitos (combo) are great.  I like that they do not drown/cover everything in cheese like many other Mexican food restaurants.  My only complaint during one visit was that their Horchata did not taste fresh.  Other than that, it's a great dining experience.
