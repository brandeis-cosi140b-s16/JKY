This is a great casual place to eat delicious latin food - everything we had was great.  I loved my arepa - the maize cake filled with nicely spiced chicken and delicious sauce.  Not to mention the affordable and very good queso and chips.  top that off with a paloma, and you have a great meal for a great price! friendly staff, several kinds of salsa available for free on the salsa bar in the back.  don't miss it!
