Fantastic!  We didn't have drinks,  but the food was so good.  We shared the tostado nachos and fish tacos.  First of all the nachos were ridiculous,  and I mean that in a good way.  Now on to the fish tacos. Probably one of the best I have had.  The salsa on it just made it that more tasty. 

Wish we had something like this in Portland,  OR
