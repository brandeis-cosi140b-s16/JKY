Great Happy Hour specials.  Good prices even outside of happy hour.  

Love the Pork verde dish on the appetizer menu, but you wouldn't go wrong with any of the appetizers or dinner items.  Drinks are a bargain.  Their Patron Fusion is by far the strongest margarita I've had in the valley and very tasty.  

You definitely wouldn't go wrong dining here!
