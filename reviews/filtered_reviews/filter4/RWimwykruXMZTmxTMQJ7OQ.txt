I recently met with the lovely Georgie S. for lunch at good ol Los Taquitos. I am absolutely certain that I gained no less than seven pounds in this sitting between the bean & cheese with Pico De Gallo burrito and the Chile Relleno. 

Yeah, that is right, I ordered and ate two full meals. 

What can I say; I like good food. Especially Mexican food. 

Little shop (Probably 10-15 tables) conveniently sandwiched in between Walgreen's and Safeway so you don't end up shopping on an empty stomach. That could be really dangerous. 

Cheap. Filling. Fattening. Yummy.
