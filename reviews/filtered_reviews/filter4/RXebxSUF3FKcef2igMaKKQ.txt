First impressions are great in their first hour of business. Super cool, totally radical atmosphere, dude. 
Very Pacific Beach style motif. Walls adorned with surf and skate gear photos and lamps. Lots of surf gear sponsorship hung around in here.
Ordered a spicy and mild fish taco and both were equally flavorful and delicious. Brown rice was done right and their Cajun beans were not bad at all. Of course everything was kicked up a notch when I squeezed my lime wedge on everything. Everything came as expected and enjoyed my meal in the outdoor seating area.
Look forward to come back in the near future and patronize their full service bar. Thanks Wahoo for the opening day schwag!
