The food is standard Tex Mex fare, but the shining aspect of Cabo Wabo is their staff. The wait for a table was close to half an hour, on a weekday, so we sat at the bar. One of the barbacks, Chris(?), was phenomenal. He took care of us from start to finish. 

The signature margarita was good, but the coconut one was the best. It is similar to a daiquiri. 

The food teetered on okay to good. The bacon wrapped shrimp was delicious, but it is hard not to love goat cheese stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon and then fried. The rice needs a little work. Not much flavor there. The tuna ceviche is closer to a tartar. It borderlines on the sweet side. The spicy shrimp with garlic chips was one of the better dishes. It had a balance of flavors and not just overtly spice levels.

Jason, the GM, came by to talk to us and was very friendly. It is refreshing to see management touch the tables and actually care about the guest's experience. Adam, another manager came around to introduce himself as well. It was a fun service experience. I would like to come back when I have more free time to check out their tequila selection.
