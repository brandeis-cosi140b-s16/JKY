Escobar's just opened a few months ago, and it's far enough off the beaten path that I imagine they're missing out on walk-in traffic.  I've only had brunch there, so I can't comment on the rest of the menu.  The brunch menu isn't too breakfast-y, but the options are tasty, and the portion sizes aren't ridiculous.  Our service the first time was excellent, and the second time, despite an almost empty dining room, our service was so-so.  The interior is gorgeous, especially the bathrooms.  I wish the menu changed more regularly, but they're new - this will improve in time.
