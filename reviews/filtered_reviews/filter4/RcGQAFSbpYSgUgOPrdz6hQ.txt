Mundo is a nice restaurant with good food and a good vibe. Last night my husband and I had the queso flameado first. It was yummy; he ate his with soft tortillas and I decided to dip the chips in the cheesy goodness instead. I ordered the shrimp diablo. The plate was bigger than I thought, but tasty. Last, we had to get a side of the Mexican street corn, which did not disappoint.
