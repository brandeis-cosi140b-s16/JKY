Stopped on way back from art museum great Patio and excellent service sampled four Tacos and the pork belly and fish were awesome not as excited about the Carne Asada good just not great. Kudos to our waitress very attentive but not pushy.all in all excellent spot to sit relax and have good food and drink.
