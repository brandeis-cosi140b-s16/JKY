I have been coming to El Hefe Tempe almost since it opened. The management has always been great and I have had good service from many of the staff who have come, gone, and even come back. The food is good and lately one bartender, Emily,  has stood out with her service. She always make you feel welcome and is quick to get you your drinks. Even when all the bar seats are full she makes sure you are taken care of. I've not only witnessed this toward myself but also to other customers. This place is always worth the visit. More reviews coming in the future.
