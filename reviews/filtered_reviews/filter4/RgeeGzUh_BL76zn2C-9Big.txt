This is the kind of fun and funky place that you just want to like.  Tiny, so going at unusual times (like later at night) is a bonus to get a seat.  They seem to be known for their fish tacos, but that's probably my least favorite thing on the menu.  The fish is peppered and not my taste.  However, the pork taco was terrific!  The kids had burritos with whole beans, great cabbage and tomatoes.  YUM.  And grape lemondade.  Sounds a little weird, but it was very refreshing and makes you feel like a kid again :-)  And with all the trippy decor, it's just part of the ride.  

Next time I'll try the hot dogs.  Seriously - the guy behind us got a hot dog with feta and bacon!!  Again, sounds a little wacky, but I can't find anything wrong with bacon and feta, so how wrong could they be on a hot dog?
