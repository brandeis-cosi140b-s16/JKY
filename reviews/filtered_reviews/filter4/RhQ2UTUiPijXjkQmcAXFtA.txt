Perfect name for this joint! It is hidden away in a little strip-mall with no sign. If you didn't know it was there, you'd have a very hard time finding the place (especially for out-of-towners like me). 

This is a hip little tex-mex place with awesome food and a surprisingly beautiful wine selection. I went on one of those 20 person business dinners and we had a blast. Service was stellar and the food was outstanding!

I had the blackened scallop quesadilla with shrimp and New Mexico sausage, rice and cowboy beans on the side (it was OUTSTANDING!). Everyone at the table was raving about their selections, so apparently everything is great. 

The servers had a vast knowledge of wine and were quick and attentive. Did I mention that the restroom was through the kitchen??? Hilarious place! Check it out if you're near!
