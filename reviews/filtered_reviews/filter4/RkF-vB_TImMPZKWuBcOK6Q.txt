A friend and I visited this location yesterday. Things didn't start off so well as after we were seated, it took approximately 10 mins for anyone to come to our table. We weren't upset about it we were just like hey, what about us? lol. Luckily for us, the person that happened to check on us just happened to be one of the manager's, who name I did not get. But she greeted us with a wonderful smile and asked if we had been helped. Sadly we said no and she took care of us right away with assigning Phillip to our table and he was fabulous. The first round of drinks was on the manager, which was really sweet. Again we were not upset at all, just wondering what happened. At any rate the strawberry margarita I received was delicious as always. We also ordered the Trio, which was on happy hour and consisted of chips, queso, and salsa. Delicious!!! Of course we had to order their signature cornbread, which was fresh out of the oven upon arrival. It was melt in your mouth delicious and yet so bad for you so you know it is extra good. By the time my yummy street tacos came, I was full from everything else.  Like I said before, Phillip, our waiter was awesome, the food was delicious, and my company was as fabulous as ever. Will I come back to this location? Of course! I chalk it up a slight mishap and a busy evening. Plus in the end, the food and service was great so what more could you ask for?
