Really great and fast Tex-Mex.  We went as a family of four on a summer Monday night around 6:30.  The place was full, but it's small.  We didn't wait to sit - but we did take the last open table.  The server was attentive and got everything right the first time around.  We loved the intimate (noisy) atmosphere.  The music is lively, and so is the crowd.  All of the things we had were great - my 11 year-old son devoured his wings.  My 15 year-old daughter elected to go with the fried tofu appetizer as her entree, and she took almost half of it home.  I had to try it myself, and thought it was a nice sweet blend of sesame, soy and peanut flavor...  Not really Tex-Mex, per s√©, but hey, it's delicious!  My steak burrito was full of flavor, and my wife had the mahi fish tacos, which she loved.  The prices were really great - with my wife and I each having two beers (we walked back to the hotel), the total price was under $70.  That's a pretty good deal, no matter what city you're in.  Loved it, and we'll be back next time in town!
