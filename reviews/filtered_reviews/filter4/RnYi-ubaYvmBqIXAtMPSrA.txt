I really wish I could give half stars bc I always hesitate giving 5's unless I absolutely loved everything, even the service, to death. So 4.5 for this place! Service was a hair slow on the order taking, but we were seated promptly and ordered chips salsa and guac. Guac is good, could be a little more flavorful. Salsa was good...they just don't give too much. I love the water of all things but maybe was just thirsty. I got the happy hour margarita. The recipe was a tad on the sour side for my liking, but still a good marg. recently I went vegetarian so I had the veggie and bean and cheese taco. My husband had all the meat you could ask for. Tortillas are hand made and spot on! Ambiance of the restaurant is nice. Younger crowd with a nice bar and outdoor seating separate from the dining room. Great find off the beaten path! Will definitely stop in again when in vegas!!
