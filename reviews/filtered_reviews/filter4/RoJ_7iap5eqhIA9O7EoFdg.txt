Good food, great atmosphere, and great prices makes for a very enjoyable Saturday evening in downtown Phoenix (and Valentine's Day, no less!) The first thing I noticed was the vibrant art work on the walls. The second thing I noticed were the chips. I love Mexican food but am not usually a fan of the stale tortilla chips that most restaurants offer. Not these. They were warm and fresh with just the right amount of salt. For dinner I had the veggie torta and for 8 bucks, it was a great deal: fresh veggies, slightly grilled bread, and enough to take home for the next day. Do yourself a favor and get the grilled sweet corn, which was fresh and flavorful. I am told the chipotle chicken tacos were also quite good, but keep in mind that these are street tacos. One won't be enough for most people. Drinks were reasonably priced -- $3 for the house margarita and $5 for the michelada (made with Tecate, not a watered down American beer!). Service was a bit slow, though. We didn't mind because we were in no hurry and maybe it was just a fluke. We will find out because we will definitely be back!
