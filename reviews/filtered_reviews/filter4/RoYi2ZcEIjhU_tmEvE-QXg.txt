Hooray for PHX Burrito House! Yes, there are a ton of great options for Mexican food in the Valley, and if you find yourself in the Melrose area looking for some hometown Mexican fare, then PHX Burrito House is the place for you. 

On my last visit I went with their carne asada burrito -  savory chunks of nicely-marinated and seasoned beef with all the fixings wrapped in warm tortilla. I also added some chips and salsa. Great flavors that hit the spot. After settling for just so-so Mexican food as of late, I was happy that I came.

Staff (owner?) was beyond friendly. Wonderful service all in all.

Easy parking, freshly-made flour tortillas and salsas and GREAT hometown service make PHX Burrito House the place for me!
