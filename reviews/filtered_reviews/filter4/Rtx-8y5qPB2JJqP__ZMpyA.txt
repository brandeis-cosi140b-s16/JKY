Yes! I'm a fan. I've eaten here twice and never left hungry, that's for sure! Food tastes great, waitresses are nice. Ambiance is hole-in-wall.. but that's to be expected given the location. I'm just happy to pay so little for so much food! Everything I've tried (mine and off other plates ;) have been very, very tasty. I love the meat combos they put on every torta. Even the chips are fun. Great place. Highly recommended for cheap eats!
