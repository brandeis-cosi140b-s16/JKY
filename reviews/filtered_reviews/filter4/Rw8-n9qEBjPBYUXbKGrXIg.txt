I love Chino's for the laid back good fast food it is. It isn't a place you go for impressions but to get good food, lots of it at a decent price. The food has always been good when I have been there and on Sat and Sun you get a free cookie with your meal, nice yummy fresh baked cookies!

I generally go for the Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Chicken and double Jerk Fried rice, a nice spicy meal for sure! 

They offer free tastes of their more popular items so you can make a good decision before ordering. 

Ordering is super easy, grab a paper and a pen and just fill in the blanks, and heck if you screw it up, no worries they always make sure you get the right stuff.
