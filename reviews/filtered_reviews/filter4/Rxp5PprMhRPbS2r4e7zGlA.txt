Tried this for lunch today and really enjoyed it. It's a tad tricky to find -park in the North most lot in the World Market Center and enter building A - but it's worth the effort ! 

The decor and atmosphere are awesome. It's nice because it's cute enough for a happy hour with girlfriends but upscale enough for a business lunch or dinner. 

It was lunch (and we had to return to the office!) so sadly no margaritas were ordered. Chips and salsas (3) came complimentary. The salsas were awesome! None were spicy, however, so those that like heat may be disappointed. We were off to a great start...

I tried the steak street tacos, and my coworker tried the carnitas in black bean sauce. Both were excellent! The steak tacos were small (as expected), but the steak was quality. It was served with a heap of guacamole and slivers of avocado on the taco. The carnita dish was awesome - huge succulent chunks of porks swimming in black beans and covered in cheese and delicious sauce. Definitely not what I would call a "light" lunch but I could imagine it's perfect for a winter day when you want something hearty. 

I would say this place is in a similar genre to Dos Caminos but the food is tastier, more authentic, and better priced. Lunch entrees were $10-$16 .
