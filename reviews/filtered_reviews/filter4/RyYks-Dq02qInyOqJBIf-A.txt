The service was great we had a older gentlemen I didn't catch his name but he was very helpful and pleasant. The food was pretty good well worth going back a second time we are even planning on bring my sister and her family here. The only thing I didn't like was the fact the young hostess dress top was COMPLETELY see threw. With the men diners that may be great but it is a family friendly and I would not like bring my kids here. It was shocking. When I say see threw I mean I could tell size color and style of bra.
