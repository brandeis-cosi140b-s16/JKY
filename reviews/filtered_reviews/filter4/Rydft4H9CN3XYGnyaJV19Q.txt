"Agave redefines the conventional Mexican dining experience by combining the radiant flavors and handcrafted care of traditional Mexican cuisine with a modern twist. Executive Chefs Matthew Silverman and Juan Saldana collaberated to create an authentic Mexican menu with a contemporary polish all presented in a traditional Mexican setting. The restaurant's dynamic architecture is reminiscent of a palapa; a structure found in the tropical resorts of Mexico, complete with a thatched roof and vibrant colors. Agave takes it name from the plant used to make tequila in the region of Tequila, Mexico. The restaurant features a bar which boasts over 80 fine Agave tequilas and encourages guests to sample the distinct flavors of each." - according to the company...and they are right.

It is a very nice place to go and the food is as good as you will fine anywhere.  Like all of my reviews I take service and expense into account and I must drop this to 4 stars.  Service isn't great, and it is overpriced...not bad...but enough.  Still, I dream of their dark red salsa.
