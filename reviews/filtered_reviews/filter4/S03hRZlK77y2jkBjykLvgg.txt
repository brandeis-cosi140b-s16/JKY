Really like this place!  You aren't going to find a Speedy Gonzales on the menu, that's for sure.  Fresh, interesting food, friendly waitstaff and great outdoor seating on a nice night. 

The chips and salsa are good (as I've mentioned, I judge a Mexican restaurant on their chips and salsa), the enchiladas are really nice (especially the corn/chicken, shrimp/crab and mushroom) and the sides are great.  The plantain black bean mash is my favorite followed very closely by the plantains.  

This place hits the list each time I'm staying in uptown Charlotte.
