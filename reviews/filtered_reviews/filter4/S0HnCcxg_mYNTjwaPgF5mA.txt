I was staying the night in Phoenix and being from New Jersey wanted to have some good southwestern Mexican food.  The desk clerk in our hotel recommended this place and I was not disappointed.  We ordered the shrimp ceviche, steak picado, and a enchilada, taco, tostada combination plate.  All of it was delicious.  Combined with a tall beer made for a great meal.
