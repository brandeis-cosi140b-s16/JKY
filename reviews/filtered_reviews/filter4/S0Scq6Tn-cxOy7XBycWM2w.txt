I was excited to try this restaurant because of the other great reviews that others had written. The restaurant is fairly small, but definitely authentically Mexican. 

When my party and I first sat down, we were given a bowl of fresh tortilla chips, and were encouraged to try a variety of salsas at the salsa bar. The salsas were interesting to taste, and helped make this restaurant unique from others that I have tried.

I ordered the tamarind soda, which was nothing special, and honestly just tasted like normal soda. Although the restaurant is well-known for their tacos, I decided to order the Al Pastor burro (burrito) which contained pork, guacamole, pineapple salsa and lettuce. The burrito tasted flavorful, fresh and delicious. I would definitely come back for another round.
