I'm sitting a couple of feet away from Sir Veza's as I wait for my flight to board. I had some time to kill and was very interested in a drink and at this gate Sir Veza's satisfied both of those requirements. Their menu is simple, I ordered a burrito with grilled chicken and a "sky harborita". Their layout is kind of weird because anywhere you stand to wait for your food and drink will be blocking either people getting drinks at the bar or people behind you waiting to order. 

Anywho, I got my burrito and drink and after a few minutes snagged a seat at a table. The harborita did it's job for $5 and the burrito was actually pretty good. Black beans, cheese, rice, meat, and a side of chile verde which was flavorful and I'm glad I dipped my burrito in it. If the burrito ($7.95) were a dollar cheaper or a little bigger, I probably would have no complaints. This is a pretty good joint and would eat here again
