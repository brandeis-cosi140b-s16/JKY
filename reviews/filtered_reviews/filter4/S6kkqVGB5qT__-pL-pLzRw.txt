This place reminds me of a place I used to see shows at when I was younger.  It's a very small venue accommodating maybe 500 or so. I've been there about a dozen times. I've never eaten there except for this past week. I couldn't see the menu very well, it had some small print and I refuse to wear glasses... yeah, vain, I know. Anyway, I saw hamburger and confirmed that it would not have onions or pork. It had some kind of aioli and lightly saut√©ed green peppers. OMG, It was a delicious burger. That, and a few beers was like $20. The beer in the venue was $3.50. What? In a concert venue? I had a someone bad experience when they had a concert out back. Just a little disorganized. But, I am a fan of this place overall. Great job and it's nice to have live music in Phoenix, especially in a venue like this.
