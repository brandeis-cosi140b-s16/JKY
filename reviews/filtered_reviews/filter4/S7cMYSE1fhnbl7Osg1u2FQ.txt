Yummy Guacamole, and they even ask you how spicy you would like it.  I ordered hot and got exactly what I wanted. The best I have had in Phoenix.

They brought over their hottest salsa, it was TOO HOT!  Holy cow, be careful on that one.  The burn doesn't go away for a while, my eyes were running it was so hot.  

The prices could be a little less expensive, but overall, I will be back.  Great for date night.  The bar staff was awesome, great service overall.
