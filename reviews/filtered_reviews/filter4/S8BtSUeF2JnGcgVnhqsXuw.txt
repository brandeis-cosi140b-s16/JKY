Great Mexican food. Probably the best spot in North Glendale . The enchiladas are my favorite. The patio area is nice. We enjoy the chips and salsa bar, excellent salsa!  It is a fun place to hang out with the family and friends for an inexpensive dinner. Oh! The special margaritas are made with Patron. Can't go wrong with Patron and they are pretty inexpensive for top shelf .  TIP: local car owners display their cars in the adjacent parking lit on Fri night. Kinda cool to go walk and look at the cars. Safe, family friendly spot
