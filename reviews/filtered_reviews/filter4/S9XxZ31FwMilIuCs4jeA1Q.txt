I found Border Grill on Opentable.com and booked reservations for brunch.  My friends and I were pleasantly surprised as to how good the food was.  The service staff was friendly and fast.  For an extra $10/person we got bottomless mimosas and that was a great decision.  It was all-you-can-eat and drink but it was much nicer than those typical Vegas buffett's where you have to get your own food.  They bring you want you want so that was really convenient.  We plan on going back to Border Grill the next time we're in LV.,
