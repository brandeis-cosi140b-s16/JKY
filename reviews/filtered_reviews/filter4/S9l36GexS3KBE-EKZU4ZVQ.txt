I liked it.
A little pricey but the selections were great, service prompt, and the meals were very flavorful. And they have beer.

My girlfriend and I went during her lunch hour on Wednesday and the parking lot was packed. We were served quickly on a buffet style line, and it was LOUD, it was a little tricky trying to figure out exactly how this place worked at first but only for a few seconds. I had bison taco's on full corn tortilla's, mixed cheese, baked and then topped with pico de gallo and some habanero sauce, My girlfriend had short rib enchilada's with 50/50 corn torts, asadero cheese, baked, topped with crema and pickled onion.

Despite the initial confusion and the crowd volume during the lunch rush, we both thoroughly enjoyed the quality and the speedy service. Will definitely be back and would recommend. Though it's best to be prepared and look at the online menu prior to arrival.
