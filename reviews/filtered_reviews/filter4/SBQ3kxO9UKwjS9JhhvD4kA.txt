I went here on a recommendation from a friend who visited Phoenix two months ago.  The date of my visit was August 2.

The food was very good.  The avocado slipped quite a bit from the sandwich, but it was good overall.  The service was so-so - my waitress didn't seem to like serving me at first after she realized that I didn't speak any Spanish, but she remained pleasant.
