I drive past Carlsbad every night on my way to work, so after check their menu online I decided to stop on my way back from picking up my paycheck.
I decided to have the habañero cheeseburger cooked rare, it came with fries and a salad.
It was tasty but could have been cooked a little less, it arrived more on the medium than rare, it's all good though, it tasted good. It wasn't too spicy. It had chopped habañeros in it and was topped with jalapeño cheese, lettuce, onion, and tomato. I would've liked a little more heat to it though.
The fries were cooked well and I didn't try the salad as I was getting full off of the burger.
The service was excellent and friendly.
I will go again, next time I'll just make sure the burger is a little more rare ;)
