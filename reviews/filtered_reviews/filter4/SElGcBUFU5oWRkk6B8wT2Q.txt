We came here for Sunday brunch and they serve it till 4pm (yay!). This also includes very spicy margaritas and large mimosas for $5! Until 4pm! Our food took a while to come out and the staff was full of characters not good or bad just unusual service. I was lucky enough to nibble off of everyone's plate and it was all savory, satisfying and very very filling!

Portions here are gargantuan! Finishing your entire plate proved to be impossible for everyone in our party so order appropriately. 

Also, the inside is very dark so if you are done with the sun this is a nice refuge. This place get 3.5 stars for me, but I think it's better to round up!
