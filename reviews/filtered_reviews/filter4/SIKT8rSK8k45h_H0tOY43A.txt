Great concept, staff full of aloha spirit, and Ono grinds!  I've tried the Huli chicken and the steak.. Love both!  Oh and their guac is very tasty as well.  No they don't have a dollar menu, but you get what you pay for ;) I wish this business much success as I plan on dining here again & again when that crazy Hawaiian with a little spice craving takes me over.. Or for the best "fast food" dessert ever, Coconut Bark!
