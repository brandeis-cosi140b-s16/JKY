Really our new favorite last minute dinner out place.  The food is very good, not the best we have ever had but very good, always hot and fresh.  Love the green sauce!  Casual enough for after practice for our family, nice atmosphere.  Servers have always been attentive and quick.  Definitely will be regular customers here.
