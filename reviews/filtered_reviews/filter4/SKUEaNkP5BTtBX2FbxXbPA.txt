If you are at UNLV and looking for a good cheap Taco fix then this is the place to go. The UNLV student special is definitely worth it. something like 4 tacos and two sides for 6 dollars. The portions are good as well especially for the amount of money you pay. 

The food is not overly impressive. Its decent quality with decent ingredients and like I said well portioned for the money. They do have a good list of 20 tacos but the student special only includes like 9 of them.  You can sub out the other tacos into the special for extra charge which I advise you do. 

The service is good and they have a full service bar which is awesome if you need a good margarita after a long day of horrible classes.
