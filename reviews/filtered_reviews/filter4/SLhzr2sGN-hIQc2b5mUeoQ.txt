My third time here, but the first as a Yelper.

Buddy and I hit PMM up for lunch, with a restaurant.com gift cert offering $25 off, minimum purchase of $35 required.

He had the "Combo Plate" which came with a nice chunk of real steak, a crispy ground beef taco, a cheese enchilada, beans, and rice.  He enjoyed it all.  Nice portion and all of it tasted good.

I had the Rib-eye soft tacos.  They were top notch.  The beef was obviously grilled and had some charred flavor to it.  

Salsa, with a green and a red, and chips, light and crispy, were excellent.

I like this place.  Priced a little higher than most, but so is the taste.
