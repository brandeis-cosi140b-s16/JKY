I've been here quite a few times, and I always order the Oaxaca Special.  Although it's a little greasy, it's absolutely delicious.  The burritos are big and the prices are pretty reasonable.  

The only thing I don't like about this place is the location.  It's in a not so great part of town, and the building looks super old and rundown.  The other two Carolina's locations are considerably nicer.
