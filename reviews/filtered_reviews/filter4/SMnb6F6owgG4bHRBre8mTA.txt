My favorite fish tacos and beer spot. A good work friend introduced me to this location. I always get same things, 3 grilled fish tacos with coleslaw, Mr. Lee's sauce (if you like things with heat), and Pacifico with salt on the rim. Best combination for a post workout meal plan. Food is prepapred fresh, and the atmosphere is sports bar like. They do have a take out for folks who are in hurry. The servers are very friendly. The grilled fish tacos with Lee's sauce are amazing. 

This location also has an awesome view of the city. Good for first dates.
