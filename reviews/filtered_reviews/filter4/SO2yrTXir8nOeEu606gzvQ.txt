Love this place. The enchiladas and spicy pasta are awesome!  Good margaritas and a cute building with lots of parking.  Only thing is that I always feel like I am sitting in the middle of the room.  It's sort of a strange restaurant lay out.  But overall an awesome restaurant with good food and good service!
