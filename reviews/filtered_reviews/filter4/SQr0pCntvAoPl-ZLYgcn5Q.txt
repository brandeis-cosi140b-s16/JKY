This is a typical moderate food joint, not fast food and not fancy schmancy. I  came for HH with a group of girls, the waitress was great and attentive to all of us. She was not cranky because we all wanted to eat and drink cheap or that we did that and took up two of her tables for a couple of hours. I think her name was Christina? 
The HH here is pretty decent, I had a $4 regular margarita and $2 avacado fries. But they had plenty of other food and drink specials 3pm-closing time. I have ate a meal here prviously and remembering it to be good, not amazing but it was good. The avacado fries were big pieces of avacado battered and fried (I picked the cripsy coating off but it was yummy with just a bit much for me these days, other wise I would have been in deep fry heaven). The Margs (as my new friend calls them...haha) were good as well. The $4 version was served in a 8-10 oz mug, strong enough for a $4 marg and not too sour. I'd definitely come back for HH again.
