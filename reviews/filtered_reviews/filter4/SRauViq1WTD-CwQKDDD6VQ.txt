Gotta say that the portions are huge! Had the steak and pork fajitas, pork was better, steak was pretty dry.  The wife had tacos al carbon, she loves it. We couldve shared one and had leftovers! Great place and ambiance, great service. The habanero hot salsa was very good.  We will be adding Nandos to our rotation. :-)
