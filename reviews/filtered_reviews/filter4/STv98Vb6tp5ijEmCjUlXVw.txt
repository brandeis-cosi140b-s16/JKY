I've been to Javier's in Newport beach, so when I heard there was a Javier's inside the Aria hotel in Vegas, I had to check it out! Very different vibe than the other location, but I love them both!! This one is in the middle of a casino floor so you'd expect it to not feel as intimate as it does, but I was pleasantly surprised! I supposed table location is important? The service is STELLAR! Food is delicious (I had the vegetable enchiladas) and the music was excellent (not sure if it was coming from the restaurant or the nearby casino floor?) I loved the fact that they had a large private dining room if you wanted to have a (semi) private party. The prices are a bit steep ($20+ for a salad??) but hey, you are in Vegas right  = )
