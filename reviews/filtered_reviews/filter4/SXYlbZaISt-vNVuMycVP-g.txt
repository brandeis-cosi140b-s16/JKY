The key is to keep your expectations low.  Don't be in a hurry.  Expect to hang out, have great conversation, pretty good mexican food, cheap but good drinks and a good time.  You go for the atmosphere (seriously and ally between two buildings with Jenga made from 2x4's) and lights strung from the trees- but you stay when you eat, drink and only have a $20 bill for two people.  I love it.  Apparently four stars worth.  Probably a fifth star if the tables weren't always sticky.  But that's not enough to keep me away. (I recommend the ooey, gooey, cheesy, something something and more cheese burrito).
