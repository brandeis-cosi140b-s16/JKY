I have been to Jalapeno Inferno a couple of times now and each time has been a good experience. My fiancé and I both love very spicy food and Jalapeno Inferno delivers. The chips and salsa are very good and they have a selection of both flour and corn tortilla chips. They have a hot salsa upon request and if you prefer a very spicy experience they also have hatch chile blended salsa for a dollar charge. I had a blended cherry sangria with frozen margarita tonight which was delicious. 

My fiancé had Courtney's Inferno burrito with chicken which we were told is the spiciest option on the menu. The enchilada sauce that it is covered in is made with blended hatch chiles and other spices. It was very good. I had the skillet chicken with hatch chiles and onions mixed with a queso sauce. It came with corn tortillas and sour cream. It was great! It was almost fajita style because I wrapped the skillet chicken in the corn tortilla with rice and beans and loaded it up with spicy salsa. Yum!

The service was a little slow tonight but not bad. Our waitress was very warm and friendly. She did forget that my sangria was on half off special but quickly resolved the issue. Overall good experience. I will be back!
