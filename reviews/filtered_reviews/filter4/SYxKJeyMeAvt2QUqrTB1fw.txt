Went there for an early-ish lunch (really was a "brunch" for us since we had woken up late (it is Vegas after all) and had missed the breakfast time frame.  We were quite happy with what we got - we weren't expecting anything overly authentic or gourmet.  We wanted good 'ol Americanized Tex-Mex food and that's what we got.  This isn't Mesa grill and it isn't a little Mexican restaurant that serves roasted goat head.   It is a Mexican restaurant on the Vegas Strip with a giant she-devil in the logo.  Doesn't make it bad though - it is flavorful and satisfying.  Our burritos were great and the salsas served with the chips were different and surprising.  

The margaritas were also excellent.  Again, nothing too special, but tangy and well-made (and not out of a slushee machine unless you ask for them frozen).  

So don't kid yourself - this isn't a gourmet experience, but if you want some good, predictable Tex-Mex and Margaritas that will satisfy you, then give it a shot.
