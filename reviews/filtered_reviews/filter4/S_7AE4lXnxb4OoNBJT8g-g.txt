Heard great things and came here and it definitely did not disappoint. The guacamole was delicious- love the pomegranate seeds. I don't remember the name, but I had the chili pepper that's stuffed with chicken and seasonal fruit. This was one of the most delicious meals I've ever eaten. Not too spicy- perfect. Wife loved it too. They were out of the pork so we weren't able to get that but my wife had enchiladas and really liked those as well. The drinks were excellent!  I only knock off because it is pricy for what you get but I would definitely come back...and get my meal again.  Also, the art outside is awesome.
