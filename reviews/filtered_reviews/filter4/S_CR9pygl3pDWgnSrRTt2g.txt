Love this place! Every time I come here the food is delicious and the staff is very friendly. They have great prices on food and great drinks! My favorite is the 3 tacos appetizer. You get a chicken, steak and pork taco wrapped in corn tortillas. A lot of Mexican food places in AZ are hit and miss, this place has great tasting everything, down to the beans and chips and salsa. Each Mexican food places I like, I like for different reasons, because of a certain dish, or what I am in the mood for. I wish I could combine 3 different Mexican food places around the valley to make 1 delicious one haha. This place has always grabbed my attention because of their tacos and tequila specials! I also have a friend who loves this place too, so its our little spot to have a great meal, great conversation and surrounded by fun people for a good night.

I am certain when you come here you wont be disappointed! Check out their happy hour when you can. Keep it up Tia Rosa!
