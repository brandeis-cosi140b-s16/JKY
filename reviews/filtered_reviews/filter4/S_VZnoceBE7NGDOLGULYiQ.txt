Place was solid. Food was hot, authentic and delicious. I read some complaints about the girl at the front. Look people, it is ok to go in, Order and eat. Sometimes a place has to offer hot, delicious, Authentic cuisine. AND THATS IT. Get off your high horse. Learn to appreciate what a place has to offer and not the amount of fake convo they want to have with you. Point at the menu item you want, and go talk with the people you came with. Not every place is a flying J truck stop with mandatory over the top friendly fake questions and concern.
