We tried a BAG in Mesa and the food was so-so. My wife loves Mexican food and we usually try different restaurants around the valley. When she mentioned this one in Scottsdale, I was kinda hesitant. 
But to my surprise, this restaurant rocks. The server was friendly and the manager came around to ask if we enjoyed our meal. 
BEsides all that, the food was amazing. We will definitely be back
