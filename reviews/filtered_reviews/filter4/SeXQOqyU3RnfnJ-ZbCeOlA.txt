Ah, the quintessential gringo Mexican restaurant! (And that's a good thing!)

Nothing here moves beyond stereotype, and what we'd expect to find in a good quality, long standing Mexican restaurant in this town. The food, the decor, the menus - all of it is like the Central Casting version of a Mexican Restaurant.

Ice cold Negra Modelo and a HUGE platter of nachos.
PERFECT afternoon snack!

You bet tus naglas I will be back!
