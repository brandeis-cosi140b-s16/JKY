I've been here three times, so I obviously like it, though not without complaint.  I think the food is really good, and the drinks are great but very pricey for off the Strip.  The restaurant is beautiful, and I'm looking forward to warm weather when the patio with bar seating is open.  There's something for everyone on the menu, and everyone enjoyed their food every time I've been.  Service has been an issue, and you get the sense that the young ladies out front are more about eye candy than knowing how to seat guests.  You can find both in this town, CL, so keep looking.  My biggest complaint with CL, like many places off the Strip, is that guests should be greeted by a server within five minutes of being seated.  If you're not able to do that, you're not really ready to seat them.  I hope CL works out it's server issues because I want them to hang around.  If they don't, they won't, and that would be a shame--it's a cool place.
