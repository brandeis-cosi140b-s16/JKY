The original. I go to the America's in Old Town all the time and the food here is just as excellent. The staff is really cool and friendly and of course I always have to get their homemade horchata w a shot of coffee.

The portions are not big but it is really tasty. The carne asada and el pastor burritos are my favorites here. Get chips and salsa to fill out that hunger craving.
