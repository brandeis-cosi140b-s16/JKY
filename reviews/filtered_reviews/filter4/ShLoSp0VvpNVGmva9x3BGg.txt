This place has a fun atmosphere, great drinks and fantastic food. I had the chicken burrito, a simple dish yet absolutely delish. We had hung out by the pool all day, and I had worked up quite an appetite! The burrito had pico de gallo, beans, yummy chicken and cheese. It was the perfect size and I finished the whole thing! (YUM!) I also had their margarita. Both of these items were on their happy hour menu- the margarita was $5 on hh and the burrito was $1 off. 

I will definitely be back!
