4 stars instead of 5 because I found their complimentary chips especially stale.

Everything else - amazing.  I brought my boyfriend here from out of town, and this was his absolute favorite restaurant out of all the other places we ate at.  A big reason was because they serve complimentary house corn salsa with their chips - he LOVES corn salsa.  (Though I think their corn salsa bowl can be much more generous.)  

They're tacos are delicious and unique - love their soft taco shells!!! They're fried but still soft and decadent.  Amazing.  I ordered both types of fish taco on the menu, and they were great.  Will definitely order again.

Ambiance/decoration - lively, colorful & fun.  I absolutely love the Day of the Dead paintings - which I could take them down and have them in my own apartment.  A great place to eat casually with friends, with drinks, and to also take your family.

Most unique/fun restaurant I've found so far since I've moved to Charlotte actually.
