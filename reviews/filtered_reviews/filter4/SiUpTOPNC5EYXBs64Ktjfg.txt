I'm originally from Southern California so I'm a big fan of good hole in the wall Mexican food. The staff here is nice, it helps if you speak Spanish which is another thing I miss about these places being from SoCal, but their pollo asado is awesome. The food is basic, beans, chicken, tortillas and rice is extra. It's good, comfort food and very flavorful. 

As a plus, its probably in the best strip mall in Tempe, next to an awesome comic shop, Otto's Pizza and Cartel. Give it a try if youre in the neighborhood.
