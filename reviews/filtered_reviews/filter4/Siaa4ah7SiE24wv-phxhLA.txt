This Z'Tejas location is my favorite out of all the other ones. The staffs here are always friendly and helpful. Love their corn bread which is always fresh and hot out of the oven. I always order their street tacos as an appetizer to share. They're  tasty and yummy! So far everything that I have tried on the menu has been delish. No complaints on the service or food yet. The only thing that I didn't really enjoy was my strawberry mojito. It had no flavor and was watered down. All I could taste was the watered down alcohol and mint leaves. I've had way better mojitos elsewhere. I will be back to try their margaritas next time.
