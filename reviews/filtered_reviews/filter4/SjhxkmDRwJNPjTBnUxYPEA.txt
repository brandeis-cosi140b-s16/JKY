I looked at reviews before coming here, they were VERY mixed so I wanted to check it out myself.. I'm staying at the Chapperal Suites next door and ended up going for happy hour (Mon-Fri 3pm-6pm). I was surprised how good the happy hour food was and only $5! I also had a frozen strawberry margarita, AMAZING!! And did I mention only $5?!?!!
We were the only ones in there when we first arrived. Chris our server was awesome, never a empty glass :)! There is a patio but it was wayyyyy too hot out (109) to be seated outside!
They have a comedy club attached to restaurant but its only open Friday and Saturday. 
This bar is fully stocked! I ordered a Tecate but sadly they don't sell it, a little bummed about that :( Ended up ordering a Corona light, was nice surprise to see it was $1.00 off! Usually only drafts are on happy hr.
All and all I had a great experience and would definitely recommend checking this place out! I WILL be back!!!
