Place is very good.  Got the table side guac which was amazing.  For dinner I got the 3 for $10 tacos which were also incredible.  My only criticisms were the tacos are two bite tacos and I got the infused water for $5 which was full with ice.  Literally had two drinks if it and it was gone.  Still a 4+ restaurant in my book.
