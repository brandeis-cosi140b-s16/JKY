When Mexican food is one of the choices, our daughter will choose it every time.  Having lived in San Diego for many years, the hubby and I are a little more picky and we usually rate a Mexican restaurant on their salsa, margaritas, and chicken tortilla soup.  I'm happy to say that all three were delicious at Mi Casa.  We also really enjoyed the ceviche.  Food prices were great...drink prices a little high, but it is Vegas.  Service was also quick and friendly.  Overall, a great experience and I'd definitely eat here again when staying at the Silverton.
