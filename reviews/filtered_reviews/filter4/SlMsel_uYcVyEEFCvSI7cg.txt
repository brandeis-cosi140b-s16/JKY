Order at the counter and you'll be served at your table. Great tacos and a small but awesome little salsa bar. The chips are not good though. I wish I had not ordered them. A different soup made fresh daily. Nice dessert selection includes traditional pastries, cakes, flan, ice cream and fruit bars. One of my favorite neighborhood go to places.
