Very nice and friendly staff.  Food is excellent and authentic, their street tacos are exactly like the ones I've had anywhere in Mexico.  Their red menudo is always a cooking and it's always great!  The large bowl is muy mas, stick with the regular bowl, it's plenty.  Excellent menu, bottled cervesas, and a couple of great margaritas.

Good times and friendly atmosphere.  Family will be regulars at this place!
