I took myself to the Otro Cafe for my Birthday today.  This is one of those nice independent places you might not find if you weren't looking for it.  I knew it was there and because my favorite pharmacist recommended it, I decided why not.
 
The food was interesting, I had the three enchiladas each with a different sauce.  I found I was expected to get all three with the same ingredients.  Because it was my birthday, and the cook was new, they let me get two vegetable and one chicken. I think i was there on the right night to be able to have gotten that substitution.  I won't plan on it happening again if I go on another night. When your server tells you about the sauces listen to.  What they describe as spicy will be.  The ingredients are fresh and tasty.  I do think I preferred the vegetable enchiladas but thought a bit more cheese in them would have been a nice touch.  

More modern Latin food is served here. Some I haven't tried so I
plan on going back to try some of the other items on the menu.  What I saw coming out to other diners looked intriguing.  

I say the prices are moderate but that doesn't include alcohol.  If you have drinks, I don't know.

Nice interior that is clean and simple.  I like that with some interesting art on the walls.  They have a nice patio out front.

Parking is not a problem at all and it is easy to find.
