The only reason I give it 4 is because the place is in a strip mall that if you blink you miss it... Service was average. Food was really good!! The bandera burito although I felt some very small pieces of cartilage, I would still eat it. My son and boyfriend had the carne asada and they liked it too. Try it!!
