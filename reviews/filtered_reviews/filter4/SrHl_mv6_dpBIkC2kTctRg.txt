After a long day at Taliesin West and Saguaro national park, I went here with a friend.  When I walked to the front door, I immediately thought the place looked like a miniature golf course replica, but maybe that is because I live in New England and our restaurants aren't as creative (except when there is a lobsta' on the roof!).  The decor inside was like a fun sports bar or Texas steakhouse restaurant, minus the peanut shells. Our waiter was nice and attentive.

We both ordered the Manchaca and tomatillo chimichanga.  Generally, I don't tend to order beef at any restaurant, except for the occasional Wendy's hamburger (I just love those square patties!).  The shredded beef was absolutely delicious.  The chimichanga was also served with rice and beans, which were fine, but the main dish stood out on its own.  If I am back in town and Carlsbad Tavern is still open, I will definitely come back.
