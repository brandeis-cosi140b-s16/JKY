Just picked up three tacos ("with everything"):
1) Adobada with pineapple - YUM!!
2) Chorizo - YUM!!
3) Asada - won't get again. Flavor wasn't there, and the meat was gristly. Blech.

The tacos didn't travel well, so I wouldn't get them to go.

If I'm hungry and in the neighborhood, I'd stop in. Wouldn't drive across town for these, though.
