Hello all,

I've had the opportunity to visit three times so far and all experiences did not disappoint. The food quality is fantastic. It's great authentic food for a GREAT value. The Salmon and Tuna Ceviche is the best. And, the Carne Asada is very tasty and well prepared. My colleagues at my third visit had the Blackened Mahi Mahi and were indeed satisfied. I had a taste ant it was perfectly cooked and seasoned.

The service has been on par at every visit, particularly my second visit. This was a group birthday dinner on a Friday night. The guest of honor was running late and the host staff were very gracious enough to offer their office to store our many birthday gifts until all guests arrived. They also offered a better table that would meet our needs.

So, after three visits, when I am in Shadyside and hungry, I look forward to dining at Steel Cactus.
