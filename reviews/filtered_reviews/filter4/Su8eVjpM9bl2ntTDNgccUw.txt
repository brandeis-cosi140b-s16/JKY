I was pretty surprised by this place. Me and two other buddies hit this place up to see what it's all about. Grab a ticket, fill out what you want, pay, then eat. Trust me you come here for the food not the scenery. I had the jade chicken in a burrito. It had a great flavor and was cooked quite well. In addition, I also got beans, jerk fried rice, and a cheese quesadia. All good, it was amazing and they use a good quality Mexican cheese.
