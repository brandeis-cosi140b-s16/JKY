So, having read some recent reviews, and being a Mexican fan, I had to get to Miguel's. Sunday's Lunch Special, Fajitas for $4.99. I arrived a little before 12 and the place was already crowded and by 12:30 every table was full. The servers were friendly and chips and salsa arrived immediately upon being seated. Although the salsa was a little smooth for my taste it had great flavor and the chips were good too! The fajitas arrived fresh and steaming, they were served with tortillas, sour cream, pico, and rice and beans. I chose the chicken, with included onions, peppers, mushrooms, and zucchini, and a great portion size...especially for the price.  
Even though the look of the restaurant is not what you would expect, it is worth a visit..and I know I will be back on Sunday when I have a fajita craving :-).
