This was the first time here since it changed over from Super Mex. We went for lunch. We were seated immediately and were given chips, salsa and bean dip. I like the chips much better than before. These are triangles as opposed to crispy whole tortillas. I ordered cheese enchiladas with a side of guacamole. My daughter ordered the carne asada street tacos. Everything was very fresh and tasted very good. The guacamole was freshly made but was a little bland for me. I added a little bit of salt at the table and it was better.  We will be coming back again to try other items on the menu for sure!
