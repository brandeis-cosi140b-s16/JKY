Really tasty Mexican food. The owner is very nice and genuine in his dealings with customers. He shakes my hand every time I go in and remembers me as though I eat there everyday (I do not). The portions are very large and everything is delicious. It is great to see a hardworking person make his dream a success. I love everything from the breakfast tacos and burritos, to the burgers, to the taco salad. It is all very good.
