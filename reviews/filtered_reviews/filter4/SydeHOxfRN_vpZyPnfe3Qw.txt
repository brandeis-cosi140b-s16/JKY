Food was great, I had a shrimp taco and a beef taco, glass of Kung Fu girl. Lots of gluten free options. Service was fantastic, super friendly and while they weren't well versed in what was gluten free, they were more than willing to find out. Only complaint is that it was super loud. Too loud. I always feel bad for my dad when the music is that loud because it really messes with his hearing aids, this was too loud for me though as well. We went early, so maybe it was happy hour...turn it down, so I can hang out longer and try more tacos!
