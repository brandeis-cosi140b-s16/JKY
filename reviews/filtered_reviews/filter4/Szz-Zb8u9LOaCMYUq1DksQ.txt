I went here for lunch on a work day.  I met my parents who brought my toddler so we could all eat together.

The waitress was friendly and patient with my toddler.  She brought out a sample of a sauce when my mother worried about it being too spicy.  We were in and out and I was back at work on time. 

Now to the food.  I ordered enchiladas with avocado and artichokes.  My mother ordered cheese and onion enchiladas.  My father ordered chicken enchiladas.  All were delicious.  I especially loved my avocado and artichoke enchiladas.  They were fresh and tasty and I didn't leave with a heavy-feeling stomach.  The cheese enchiladas were also very good.  The black beans were very bland but the rice was delicious.

I would happily go back to this restaurant.
