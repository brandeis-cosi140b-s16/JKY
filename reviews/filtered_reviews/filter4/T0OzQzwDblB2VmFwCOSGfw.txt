Had a great experience here. Came with a group of about 40 for a business dinner. We had a good chunk of the restaurant. The menu was pre-arranged and I'm pretty sure we got 12 of everything which was a lot of food.  Service was great, which is sometimes not the case for such a big group.

The winners of the night were:

The fish tacos. Spicy, flavorful...I would go back just for those!
The Mac and cheese. Chili poblano, corn and manchego cheese....so good
The 3-corn pico de gallo. It's more of a side than a salsa. The textures and flavors were awesome.

The margarita was too sweet. I wouldn't get it again. The dessert was also meh, but the rest of the food and the service made up for it.
