Clean restaurant, good food seasoned well, large portions.  I am a fan! The beef bulgogi plate and the pork bulgogi plate are both very good and I recommend trying both of these meat plates.  If you spring for the fried rice, it is delicious!  I recommend giving this place a try for a good meal at a good price when you are in the mood for something casual yet adventurous.
