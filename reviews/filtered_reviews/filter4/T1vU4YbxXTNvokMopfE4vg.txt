Easily one of the better Latin/Mexican restaurants in the area.

Menu selection is large with very good service, prices are affordable, and with the amount of food you get- a bargain.

Burrito was a little sloppy and oily, but palatable. Tacos seemed a little more healthier, but lacked the content of the best tacos (not enough lettuce, meat)
