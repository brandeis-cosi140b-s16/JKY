Aloha! 
Haha, super friendly staff! Right when we walked in we were greeted.  I love that!  It was out first time so they gave us some samples the pork and huli chicken. Both were super delicious!  It's like chipotle. So I went with the huli huli chicken bowl which comes with rice and beans. The rice had some seaweed with it. Tomatoes, corn, jalape√±o, and lots of goodies! It was so flavorful. Taste so good. Well back back to try ether the tacos or burrito next !
