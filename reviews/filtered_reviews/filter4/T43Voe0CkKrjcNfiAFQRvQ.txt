This place has changed a lot!

The addition of the outside, tiki-esque bar and boche ball give this place a much more relaxed feel.

I came here for my very last Breakfast Club UYE. We came specifically because the chocolate fountain is included w/ brunch. Quite honestly, I couldve done w/out it. A bit too sweet, but the fruit was good.

Our large group was seated on the patio, thankfully, while the patio weather was still bareable. Our waitress was a bit slow, which was puzzling considering we were one of 3 tables in the entire place. She did a good job keeping all of our checks straight though.

They have a good number of selections on their brunch menu. I chose the Mexican eggs benedict over the traditional. This one comes w/ chicken instead of Canadian bacon. It was really good, though Id go for the traditional next time due to the dryness of the chicken. The hollendaise was seasoned nicely though, and the eggs poached perfectly.

Id definitely recommend this for a brunch spot, especially if you have a major sweet tooth.
