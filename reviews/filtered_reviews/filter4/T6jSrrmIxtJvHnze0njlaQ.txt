Great new addition to Roosevelt Row!  We stopped in last night on our way home from the airport and had a great experience.  Nice space, friendly staff and super tasty food.  We tried the rock shrimp, carnitas, tinga and carne asada tacos with rice and beans - flavorful, fresh and just plain tasty!  Good neighborhood place to enjoy some good food on the patio or in the bar while watching the game!
