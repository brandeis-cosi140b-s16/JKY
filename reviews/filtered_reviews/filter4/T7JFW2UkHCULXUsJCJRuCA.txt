Stopped here on a Friday night & was not disappointed.  DJ spinning just about every kind of music.  Never heard such a variety & I go to a lot of clubs.  A little small but a ton of fun.  They lost a star because the bar could have used one extra bartender.  The drinks were on par with other Vegas clubs, maybe even a buck cheaper.  Beer & a top shelf vodka tonic for $20.  I will definitely make this a stop whenever I am in town.  Ladies free & guys cover reasonable.
