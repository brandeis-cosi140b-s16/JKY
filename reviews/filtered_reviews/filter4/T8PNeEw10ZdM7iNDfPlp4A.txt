Poblano. Chicken. Enchiladas. Incredible! Sauce was amazing. Roasted chiles mixed with heavy cream. Get me a straw!
Guacamole was very good.
Our server seemed to have a bit of amnesia going on. Water stayed empty after the initial fill, salsa as well.
This place is one the high side of average price, but it is convenient to the convention center and seating/serving was fairly quick.
