Stopped here for lunch with some co-workers on our way back to the office after an interview.  Was seated quickly and our server arrived shortly there after to take our drink order . . . drinks arrived and our order was immediately taken.  Quick service.

While waiting for our food we received a telephone call letting us know that we had gotten the project . . . whoo hoo a $13,000,000.00 school . . . just wat the doctor ordered.

Back to the food . . . it arrived quickly and hot . . . ordered the Chili Relleno . . . which tasted great, along with the corn bread.  So why only four stars you ask . . . I have to go back once the high from getting the new project wears off . . . just to verify that they do deserve five stars . . . didn't what my judgement clouded.

With that said . . . see you here again soon . . .
