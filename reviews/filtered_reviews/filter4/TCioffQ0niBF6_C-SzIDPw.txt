Came here with a friend of mine as we wanted to try some Mexican seafood and this restaurant is supposedly one of the best options in Phoenix. I haven't been here before they remodeled the interior to fit more seating but it definitely looks really nice now and very colorful inside.

We decided on getting the Shrimp Cocktail and the Molcajete for two people. The Shrimp Cocktail was very tasty and everything we had hoped for. As for the Molcajete we were a bit disappointed that there was quite a bit of chicken and steak since we had hoped for more seafood. The sauce used was a "Diabla" sauce which was really good and surprisingly not as spicy as I had anticipated. I'm glad that we tried their house specialty but would probably pass on it next time that we come here.

Service was friendly and prompt. Overall this is a great place if you're looking for Mexican style seafood!
