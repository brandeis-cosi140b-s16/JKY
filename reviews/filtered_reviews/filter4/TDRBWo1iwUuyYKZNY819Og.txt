I just recently moved to Vegas.  I was hungry and thought I would try their beef taco dinner.  I was surprised how good it was.  My son loves their carne asada tacos.  It is fast Mexican food and they are open 24 hours a day.  There are several locations of Roberto's which is great by me.   I have been going to Roberto's at least once a week since I have been here.  The great part is you can go whenever you get hungry for Roberto's.  They also have daily specials which are a great bargain and come with a drink.  I tried one of their carne asada taco specials and I can see why my son loves them.  I would definitely recommend you try Roberto's if you are near one and find yourself hungry.  You will not be disappointed...
