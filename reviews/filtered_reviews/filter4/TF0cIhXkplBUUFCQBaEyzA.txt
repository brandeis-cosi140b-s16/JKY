I had high expectations coming here because I heard about them on the morning blend. I was highly satisfied with the food and service. We got the nachos as an appetizer it was a perfect Mexican American blend of taste! The burger my boyfriend got was good as well as my enchiladas,  although I preferred the red sauce over the green, it had more flavor. Overall great place. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to get full!
