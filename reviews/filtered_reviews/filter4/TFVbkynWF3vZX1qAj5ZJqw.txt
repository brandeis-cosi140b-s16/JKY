Today we felt like a good juicy burger and since it was during the week, which was a treat for myself and my husband, we decided to head over to Fat Boy for a good burger.  

I ordered the double bacon with cheese, I know it sound like a lot, but I love burgers!  It was cooked medium well but remained very moist, with the juices running down my hand, in between my fingers as I took my first bite.  I love the addition of the tomato, pickles and shredded lettuce.  

Of course my husband had the monster burger and had to order the Chencho fries.  The thick cut potato strips where cooked crispy, lightly golden, and then smothered in green chili, chicken, and cheese.  All melted and gooey.  It was a good addition to the meal.
