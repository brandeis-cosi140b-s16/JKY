First night of vacation and it got off to a nice start with dinner at El Encanto.  Margaritas were tasty.  They provided 3 different salsas which we liked. Our daughters split chicken fajitas and really enjoyed them.  My wife and I split a sampler platter.  Chicken Fundito was good, green tamale was good and as was taquitos. Didn't care for the beef tamale.  Sat inside, along the pond, nice setting.
