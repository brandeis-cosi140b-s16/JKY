First visit. Went with a girlfriend. 
Everything looked great on the menu. Nothing looked boring and "plain old mexican" at all.

Their house salsa is SUPER yummo. Definitely homemade. Lots of fresh ingredients.

Serving sizes were too big, especially for lunch. It looks like they have the same menu for lunch and dinner (although I didn't ask). 3 enchiladas are too many at lunch time, because those chips are filling! So we split an order of the green chili enchiladas and (she had 2) I got a carne asada taco.

It was all delicious. Everything was fresh and yummy.  The food split was perfect, although I still ate too many chips. But that salsa was verry good! 

Great attentive staff. Good food. We will be back!
