This shop is a converted house in the Coronado neighborhood of downtown phoenix. It has just opened.

I ordered the carne asada tacos and they came in a corn tortilla with guacamole and grilled onions and they were really really good, they are street tacos style My wife ordered the quesadilla vegetariana and she really liked it, she liked the jamaica Mexican water even more!

They also offer coronitas, which is nice if you just want a small beer.

The only thing i didn't like was the ambiance, it was missing some music, and the fact that it won't be open on Sundays. But, with $2.25 tacos you can't go wrong!
