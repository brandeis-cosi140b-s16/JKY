I came to Border Grill with no expectations:  I was staying in Vegas with my fiancee and had unexpectedly run into my brothers (who are always looking for an excuse to come from L.A. and gamble).  No one was in the mood for anything too fancy, and one of my brothers is a vegan, so we searched around online until we found a spot that had the potential to make everyone happy.  Mission accomplished, Border Grill.  Everything you could want in a Mexican restaurant was here:  friendly service, a wide variety of quality margaritas, great salsas and guacamole, and entrees that were inventive yet at the same time familiar (in a good way).  Everyone, including the vegan, came away happy, which is no mean feat with such a picky group.  I definitely would eat here again and look forward to trying some of the other locations.
