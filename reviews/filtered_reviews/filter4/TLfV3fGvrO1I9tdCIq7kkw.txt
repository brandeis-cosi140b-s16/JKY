This is a cute taco place! Nice up-scale Tex-Mex take on tacos. They have other items like burritos and Nachos. Unfortunately, they did not have any enchiladas. They have amazing queso and salsa. The salsa is extremely fresh and a bit spicy. They have a great selection for tacos and margaritas. I had the Magic Mike margarita (they call it their skinny margarita) and I had two tacos. I had the "stage five clinger taco" as well as the "I'll have what she's having" both were very good! Overall experience was great; however, our server could have done a better job. She was un-aware of us for the majority of the time.
