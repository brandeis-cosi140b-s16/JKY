I ate here a week or two after they first opened up.  They must have been trying to impress customers because I received great service from the staff.  My food was pretty damn good too.

I order a rack of ribs, which were tender and delicious.  I also wanted to order other racks around the restaurant but they weren't actually on the menu.  Yeah, they had a pretty good looking staff during my visit.  I felt my GF jerkin my chain every now and then just to let me know she was still there, hehe.  Our waitress was very nice and our food didn't take too long arrive.

The drinks were average but that isn't much of a complaint since most drinks in Vegas tend to be very watered down.  Would I go here again?  Hell Yeah.  The prices were decent too.  The only true complaint I have is that they didn't have my size T-shirt in stock.  Grrr!
