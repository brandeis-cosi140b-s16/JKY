You'd think it's hard to go wrong with a burro. Well, I've had my fair share of bad ones. But the chili rojo I got at the Original Burrito Co. was done right! Pork, rather than beef! Lots of it! Lots of the spicy sauce! Deliciousness abounds!

Also, take a note from me and be sure to read before doing.

Clearly, I don't pay attention as much as I should, but....

...When I see a bar of salsa, my first instinct is to run...toward it. Then of course I realize that there are only paper cups without lids to put said salsas and pico in. When you've got an order to-go, this could be tricky. Then you might notice the sign that says that salsa comes prepackaged with your to-go meal. I am such a ditz sometimes.

Anyway, after a few mix-ups, and me being a nervous and easily embarrassed person, we finally got home with the goods. And like I already said, everything was pretty solid. The salsa was nice and spicy with good flavor, although I thought the tomatoes in the pico were a little mushy. The tostadas looked pretty nice, too.

The menu was also pretty expansive, and I'm sure any of their burritos, platters, or tacos are excellent.
