This is another Northern Scottsdale Mexican restaurant that I have been coming to for many, many years. Good Mexican food, not too fancy but definitely has some flare. I great place to sit outside under the misters and enjoy a margarita for happy hour.

Highly recommended for anyone looking for good Mexican food.

Tip: I usually order a child size cause I can't eat a full portion.
