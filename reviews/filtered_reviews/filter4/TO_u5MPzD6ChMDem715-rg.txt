Best. Taco. Salad. In. Phoenix.

Seriously, that stuff is amazing. This is probably because they make all of their own salad dressings. I get 2 or 3 of them on the side with every salad and that works so well for me. I get to taste a range of amazing flavors, appreciate the talent of their chef, while moderating the amount of extra calories I'm eating.

Another plus? The steak on it is amazing. Lean, pink in the center and tender! I really have to give it to them for producing such an amazing salad. Puts everyone else in PHX to shame.
