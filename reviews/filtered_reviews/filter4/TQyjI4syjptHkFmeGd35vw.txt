Another late night craving before finals week.. I know I will stay awake after eating here

I have been to the other Tacos El Gordo and we decided to try this one out since it is fairly closer to home.  The place is busy since it is on the strip.  

I actually took some time to look at the menu this time and noticed some interesting tacos such as beef tongue and beef brain.  I didn't think they would be appealing to me so I stuck with my usual; carne asada fries.  Full Size please..  Order first, pay after.  Seat yourself.  Also do remember to ask for hot sauce and mild sauce.  The other place I went to offered, but she could have just forgotten.  My carne asada fries looked wonderful as it usually does, layered with cheeses and two scoops of guacamole.  Obviously delicious since I ate it all.  Tender meat and skinny fries.  Not salted.. Fries a little crisp.. 

Now, I did reach over and picked a piece of brain from my friend's taco.. That was very interesting.. mushy and no flavor.. I was definitely better off with fries.  I guess you have to acquire a taste or demand for it.  But the tacos looked excellent from my view of the booth.  

Great late night place, little condiment bar with lemons, slice beets, etc.  Self serve drinks.  Little tables.  Fresh Mexican food smell. 

Would I come back, Yes! But next round will be at the other location.. I want to compare and contrast.
