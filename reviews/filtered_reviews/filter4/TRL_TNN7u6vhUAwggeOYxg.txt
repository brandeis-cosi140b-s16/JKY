I gave this place a second chance. I came in and ate this time. I didn't see the angry old man who works the front, I usually order to go and he's so rude. This visit, I sat in the bar. The food was good. I ordered the chicken chimi lunch special.  The service was courteous and they were very attentive. I will keep coming back is service stays like this.
