The fish tacos came highly recommended....pretty damn good, but nothing life changing lol. I've had better in Cali. My cocktail was also pretty good but light on the alcohol. I would go back because they definitely had a creative menu and I should've ordered something I couldn't literally go get off a street corner lol. The guacamole was good though. I can't front on that. 3.5 stars but I can round it up to 4 over 3.
