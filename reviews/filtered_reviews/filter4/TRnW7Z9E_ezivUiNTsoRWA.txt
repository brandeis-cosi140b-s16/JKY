Stopped in for happy hour the other day to try the latest edition to the street taco crazy taking over Phoenix.

The place is small but well decorated and cozy and I loved the lighting at the bar. 

We split the street tacos which were only $1.50 during happy hour! What really set them a part were all the sala choices. I picked 6, my favorites were the roasted corn, chipotle and avacado crema. I can't wait to go back and try the rest of them on the menu. The coronas were still around 5 bucks on happy hour which was pretty high, but they did have house margaritas and wines for $5.

I will be back
