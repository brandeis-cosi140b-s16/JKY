We've been coming here for a couple years now since we found it. The environment is colorful and culturally authentic to the food. Although I haven't quite yet figured out how the dolls & clowns play into it but whatever, it's fun to look at. 
The staff has always been very friendly and on point with their customer service. My glass is never empty, the buss boys are like ninja re-fillers. 
I love that they do table side guacamole and you can make it as mild or spicy as you like. Chips, salsa and bean dip come to the table when you first sit down. 
One of my favorite dishes here is their fajitas. Shrimp and/ or chicken. The tortillas are home made, you can't beat that! Fideo soup usually comes with an entree. I always add a little salsa for a kick. 
If you're celebrating a birthday be sure to let them know. They'll come on over and sing in English & Spanish. 
We always save room for some sopapillas too.
