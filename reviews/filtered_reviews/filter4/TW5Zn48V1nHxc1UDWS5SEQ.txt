Pretty good food for cheap. 

Tacos are $2 each and a full order of fries is $10. But you can get half for $5 which is still a good amount. 

I like coming to this place because the lines are not long at all. I've been to the one on the strip twice and waited over an hour both times. 

I usually get the al pastor tacos and fries. The green sauce they put on them are insanely good.
