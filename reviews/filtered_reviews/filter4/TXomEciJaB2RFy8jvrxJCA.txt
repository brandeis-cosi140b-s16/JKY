Went here with a mad hangover with a few friends earlier today. Let me just say, the food certainly hit the spot. I'd been told by some to order anything with carne asada. Boy, am I glad I did!

I got the Carne Asada quesadilla (XL, as the regular is just an 8 in tortilla folded in half). It was delicious. Caramelized onions, lettuce, tender carne asada .... it melted in my mouth. 

Also had some yummy chips and salsa. The patio seating was nice and the shade was an added bonus. I'll definitely check out this place next time in Tempe. :)
