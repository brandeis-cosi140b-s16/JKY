I've been to Los Dos Molinos a handful of times, but just to pick up to-go orders of their famous salsa.  I usually get a pint of both the red & the green - both are some of the best I've ever had and is reason alone to go.  The salsa is absolutely on the hot side but more than manageable if you enjoy heat.

I had my first dine-in experience with me, my wife, my 5 month old and my wife's parents (5 of us total).  The inside is fairly small and it was too hot to eat outside.  My father-in-law loves hot food and couldn't stop talking about how great it was.  My mother-in-law ordered some fresh guacamole to cool her palate.

The 4 of us each ordered something different and all of use really enjoyed our order.  Two things I'll mention: 1) the portions were huge and no one finished what they ordered 2) their reputation as "the hottest food in phoenix" didn't necessarily live up to the hype.  3 of us ordered a dish with the chile next to it.  The flavors were very good - just not hot.  Adding some of the hot salsa kicked up the spice.

Would recommend the food and especially the both salsas.
