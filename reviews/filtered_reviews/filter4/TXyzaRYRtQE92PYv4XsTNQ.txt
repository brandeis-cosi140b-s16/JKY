The Michoican restaurants have always been a favorite of mine.  The quality of the food and the service is exceptional and the variety of dishes is surprising for a mexican restaurant.  I took my mom for lunch and she really loved it!  She was a little apprehensive about the spicy heat factor but they fixed that up for her!
