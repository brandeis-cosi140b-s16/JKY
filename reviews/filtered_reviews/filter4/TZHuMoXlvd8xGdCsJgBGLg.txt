Chino Bandido has the best food you never thought you'd ever enjoy.  

I ordered the combo plate since I wanted to try a wider variety of what they had.  I got their ginger chicken, the jade chicken, the pork fried rice, and the black beans and jerk fried chicken wrapped into a burrito. 

Ginger chicken: awesome
Jade chicken: awesome
Pork fried rice: great but not something you eat just by itself, you've got to mix it up with everything else 
Black beans: omg - these are great.  I'm not sure why but they tasted like pizza tomato sauce but hey, pizza tomato sauce tastes good too.

I'll be back again, it was pretty good and while I was sitting at the picnic tables (the plastic folding tables rock) I read up on the history of Chino Bandido online and it's just an all around great story of a super successful family owned establishment that came up with a unique menu and hit a home run. 

If you're up for something new and something you won't find elsewhere, swing by and grub.  I'm bringing some friends from London and Hong Kong to eat here later this week.  I'm sure they'll love it.
