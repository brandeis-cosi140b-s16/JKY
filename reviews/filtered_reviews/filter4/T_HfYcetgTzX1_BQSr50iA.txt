The food here is pretty good. I've had quite a few things off the menu and am yet to be disappointed.  It's definitely not the cheapest place to eat but the food is worth it.  I've only been here around lunch time and if you're there during the peak times for lunch, it gets really busy and it's hard to find a place to sit.
