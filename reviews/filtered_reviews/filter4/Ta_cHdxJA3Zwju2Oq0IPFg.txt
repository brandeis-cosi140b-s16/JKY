North Scottsdale is blessed to have Habanero's in its' midst, and here's why.....
All the other Mexican food establishments in the area are corporate with little or no authenticity. Mexican food in North Scottsdale is pretty much styrofoamic. (Is that a word? It is now). And then along came Habanero's.

Clearly this place is a family operation.  The menu has a nice selection and is very economically priced. Fajitas are like $7, but we didn't get them. We ordered Chicken Nachos to start and they were wonderful. I liked that they were light on the cheese and heavy on the chicken. Very tasty.  We also got Blackened Shrimp tacos and fish tacos.  All were excellent.  My little guy got the kid's cheese quesedella and he was happy. The tacos had great flavor. The bill was very low.
Keep up the good work and try this place before it gets packed.
