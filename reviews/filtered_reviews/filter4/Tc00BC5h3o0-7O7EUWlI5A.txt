I'm very late on updating this to 4 stars! I only go during half off. If it's after 11 pm, and I'm hungry, this is the first place that comes to mind (even over fuel and fuddle). My favorite thing to order is the dance marathon sub steak on a wheat tortilla. If you're with a group, I'd recommend sharing an order of barbacoa nachos; it'll feed at least 3 people.

$5 22 oz drafts promos are great. The $7 big azz margs are also fun, but I stick to the 12 oz that'll do the job well enough for $3 too. I'm not a fan of the taste of tequila so I stick with the original lime on the rocks (it masks the taste well).

One thing I wish that I knew earlier is that "Jersey Chips" are waffle fries. (They're good.)
