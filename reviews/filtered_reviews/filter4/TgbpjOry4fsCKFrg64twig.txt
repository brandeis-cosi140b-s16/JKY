We came here last night with a group of 11. Since none of us had come here before, one of our friends called ahead to make sure they could accommodate all of us.  They said they don't do reservations, but that they had plenty of seating and said they were excited to have us. When we got there at 6:30, surprisingly they weren't busy at all. They were able to give us samples for any of the meats we wanted try, which was  great since some of their meats that were labeled as spicy, were spicier than what I'm accustomed to. So definitely ask for samples if you've never been. I ordered the 5 street tacos, each one with a different meat topped with cilantro, corn, lettuce, tomato and sour cream. I also ordered a side of rice but unfortunately they were out of guacamole.  All the meats  were very good but my favorite was their carne asada. The flavor just stood out among all the rest. One of my friends ordered the burrito. Oh MY was it big! I've never seen anything that big before. I'll be ordering one those next time! They were a little slower than Chipotle. I just think they need to master the process of assembling the tacos/burritos/bowls and they're good to go!  I do have to say they have exceptional customer service otherwise. We didn't realize it, but they actually close at 8pm and our group stayed past 8:30. They didn't say anything to us and let stay until we were done which was really nice of them. All I have to say is another great find in North Central Phx =) .
