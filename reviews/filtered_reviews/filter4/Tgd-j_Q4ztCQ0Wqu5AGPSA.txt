Great place for a Sunday All Day Happy Hour! Their drinks are on special which is exactly what we needed as we were toasting a friend of ours who had recently passed away but loved her some margaritas, chips, salsa and guac. So we honored her by having all  of her favorites. The HOT MANGO margarita which is Chili-infused Blanco, Fresh Lime, Triple Sec, Mango was absolutely delicious! Their mini pork tacos along with the endless supply of chips and salsa was equally as good. Seriously a great place to celebrate a friends life and toast to her. I will definitely be back again soon!
