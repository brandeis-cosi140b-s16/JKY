Fun eclectic restaurant great Mexican food nachos were really good and a must try. Sangria was good happy hour margaritas were good. Make sure you ask if pork is on any of the dishes that you order because they will throw chirizo on it. Servers are good but check your bill when it comes to make sure all items are accounted for correctly as we found some mistakes.
