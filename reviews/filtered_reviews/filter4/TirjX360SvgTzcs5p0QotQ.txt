We've driven by this place plenty of times and paid it no mind. It just seemed odd that they boast both great Mexican food and  good burgers and hot dogs, but we are definitely glad we stopped in today. As for the burgers and dogs, I can't really say because we were on the hunt for Mexican food. This place hit the spot! They might sell both types of cuisine but they definitely specialize in Mexican. 

First, they offer samples of everything which is really convenient. We tried the pollo adobado, pork adobado, carne asada, and barbacoa. They were all delicious. We settled on the carne asada burritos enichlada style. The green sauce is spicy but has a great citrus and tamatillo flavor. The red sauce is mild and has a more traditional red chili flavor. The food was delicious, filling, and definitely tasted fresh. 

we also tried the menudo but it lacked the "bovine" flavor of a well-made authentic menudo. The flavor was flat and kid of watery, pretty boring. 

All in all, we left satisfied and with plans for a future visit. I would definitely recommend this place. If nothing else, the burritos were cheaper, bigger, and tastier than Chipotle or Qdoba.

As a side note, the restaurant also offers a traditional side bar.
