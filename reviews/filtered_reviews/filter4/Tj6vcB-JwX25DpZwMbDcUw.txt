We ate: 

House-made Chips & Salsa--had a unique, roasted flavor and some spices that I could not quite place.  Server said it was tomatillo, yet it was red and I've only ever seen green tomatillos.  Delicious and not your usual tomato-onion-garlic-cilantro-lime affair.  

Chapulines (lime & garlic)-- Texture was nice, flavor was too sour.  Opt for the chili flavor instead.  

Street Corn--Sweet, salty, crunchy, blackened just enough.  

Street Tacos--Mix and match to get a variety of flavors.  

Flan--Easily the best item on the menu.  We only ordered it because it came free with the yelp check-in.  It was IMMENSE.  More like creme brule than flan.  Very rich and creamy.  

Come for the salsa, stay for the flan.
