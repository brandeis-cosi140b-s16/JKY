I'm always skeptical of Mexican places outside of SoCal, but the food here was top notch.

The ceviche was tasty and the pork green chili was so delicious I wanted to drink the sauce.

Our waiter recommended a tequila for shots, and I really didn't care for it.  I would've preferred patron I think.  The margarita he recommended was delicious though, so he totally redeemed himself.

They were able to split our bill for each specific order and split the margarita and ceviche among only the people who ordered those.  Very impressive.
