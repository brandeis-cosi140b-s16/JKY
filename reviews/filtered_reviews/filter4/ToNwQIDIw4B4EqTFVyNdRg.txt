We chose the chicken and steak nachos they were so good! $20 and we were able to split them between THREE starving people! They were huge! The rest of our group chose some other things on the menu that were definitely over priced and small but I was thoroughly impressed with my nacho plate so I cannot complain!! They have people handing out 2 for 1 drink cards- take them because their drinks are pricey if you're not there during happy hour. I heard they're happy hour is amazing too!!!
