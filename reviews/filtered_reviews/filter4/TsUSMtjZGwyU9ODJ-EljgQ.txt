I was very impressed with this new Fuego!  I can't say that I care much for their location at the Esplanade - but since this new location is close to home and work, I had to give it a try and am glad I did!

It is a full service restaurant and Fuego does a much better job with the space than the previous tenant ever did. It is still small but they fit about 10 tables in without making you squeeze next to strangers, there is also a decent patio for those lovely summer nights.

The veggie tacos were fantastic and come with a flavorful chipotle cream sauce, they reminded me of the Ticoz tacos, before they went downhill. They have several vegetarian options on the menu in addition to the tacos. 

Fuego is on a pricey side for the downtown business lunch crowd, around $10 a plate.  I wish they had smaller lunch specials in the $7 range.
