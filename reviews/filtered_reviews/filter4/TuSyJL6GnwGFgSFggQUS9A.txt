I absolutely love Gallo! It's my favorite place to come in after a long work week. I prefer their delicious tortas - primarily their fish and vegetable ones! Their vegetable tacos are also very tasty, though the tortilla usually gets too soggy to stay together and I often have to finish my taco with a fork. 

Their menu is rather diverse and there is something for everyone. Overall, this is the only place that I have been able to find where I can get a good vegetable torta and still be able to bring along my family and meat eating friends without having to beg for company. 

Their happy hours specials ( I definitely recommend their sangria), taco Thursdays and flamenco nights are also a treat. The service is usually very friendly, accommodating and helpful. 

Did I mention that their dessert is to die for and that they serve Cartel Coffee?! I have tried every single dessert item on their menu and have absolutely fallen in love with their Orange Cake. It was love at first bite - just moist, tangy and sweet enough to satisfy my dessert needs. The portion is rather large, so I suggest you share! If you have not tried Cartel Coffee (they have a location in Tempe) I highly suggest that you do, the flavor is bold, rich and nutty - it does not disappoint. The only downside to having Cartel Coffee at Gallo, is that Gallo rarely carries soy milk or a soy creamer so that is usually an issue for those of us that can't process dairy too well.

Lastly, I can't think of a better joint in town that serves fresh Mexican food with as much flare as Gallo does - their execution is superb, their location is ideal, and the atmosphere is tres chic.
