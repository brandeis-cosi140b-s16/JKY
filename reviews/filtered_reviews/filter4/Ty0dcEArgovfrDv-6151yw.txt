I really like Yayo Taco -  the food is great and they have a good selection of uncommon beers. They have pretty low prices for the caliber of their street tacos and the staff is always nice. 

Be aware they often have live acts at night (music, poetry, etc) that aren't great to listen to if you're trying to have quiet dinner or something. For lunch, this place is fantastic though. 

t's about $2 a taco and they give you a lot of food. Also, I'm seeing people complain about the bathrooms in this place, but I've seen apartments in this area with much worse. Overall, I recommend Yayo Taco.
