Every trip to Vegas I always wind up here one night because of the nachos. My friends and I sometimes say we want to go to Vegas  just to get these nachos. Once again, they didn't disappoint.

The only con about Diablo's is the margaritas. Over the past few years the margaritas have consistently gotten weaker and weaker. My dad told our waiter that his tip depended on how strong the pitchers of margaritas were because the last few times we had been disappointed. Our waiter told us he'd take care of it. Well, the margaritas tasted watered down again. Our waiter than brought us about a shot and a half of extra tequila to add and margaritas still tasted watered down and tequila-less.

But drinks or not I'll still be back for the nachos!
