You've got to expect prices at any sit down restaurant in any airport to be higher than if you were in a similar restaurant off-airport.  So I didn't flinch at the $14 price for a chicken burrito, because I knew I'd be paying over $5 for a processed burger at a fast food place (bleh!).  Instead, my burrito was chunk full of chicken, avocado and spices and was served with spicy fries.  Tasted quite good!  I sat in the lounge area on a sofa with a small table and was able to kick off my shoes and work from my iPad as I enjoyed my meal.  My server, Shauna was excellent and so friendly.  Would call me by name every time she passed by to make sure I was taken care of.  A great place to relax and enjoy a meal or drink away from the fast food crowds before taking flight!
