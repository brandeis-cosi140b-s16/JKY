A girlfriend and I checked out this hidden gem this past Sunday! The patio is amazing and the umbrella's came in clutch when it started to sprinkle.  We missed the brunch menu this time so we'll have to come earlier next time but the food was still outstanding. I got a chicken quesadilla and my friend got two tacos. We also split chips n salsa & queso (which was to die for)  The drink selection is really where it's at though! With clever names inspired from cult movie classics and $5 drink specials daily, RuRu's is quickly becoming my new favorite Mexican spot! The only negative thing I have to say is that the service was a little slow --- but I also realize that we were the only table on a rainy Sunday afternoon and that we were seated out of view of the waitstaff. Regardless, I'll still be back!
