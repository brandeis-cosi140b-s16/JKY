The food at Pink Taco is nothing amazing..basic Mexican fare with a few flares here and there. What I did not expect when I walked into this Hard Rock hotel establishment was the abundance of tequila they had...and the prices per shot were not too bad (considering it's Vegas). 

I had a glass of the Milagro Reserve Anejo and El Tesoro Anniversary Tequila. Both were great...as the staff takes pride in their liquid refreshment. If you are in the mood for good tequila, served without salt and lime, then make sure to head to Pink Taco at the Hard Rock!!!
