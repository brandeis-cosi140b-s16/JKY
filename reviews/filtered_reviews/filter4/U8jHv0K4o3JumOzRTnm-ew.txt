Took a customer to lunch today at the tempe store and had a great experience!  We sat at the bar and we're well taken care of by  the bar tender ...... Nuts, I did not get his name.  2 great lunches and 6 adult bevies and out the door for $98.00 which included a 20% tip.

This joint has always been good.  If you've not tried them, give em a try and I'll bet you'll be pleased.
