Nothing wrong with hotel restetaunts, but they normally are not my cup of tea.  Gallo Blanco, however, breaks the mold. Greeted warmly by the hostess we were seated directly below a large fan. We asked to move, no problem, we were moved to our table of choice with a smile. 

Our server ( ?Dre)  was very good, offering suggestions when asked, otherwise non intrusive and allowed us to enjoy our food. ( see my photos).  After drinks (an ok yet refreshing Sangria and a well mixed Henricks G & T with lime) we ordered an Ahi appetizer with guac and chips-- very light, thin slices of the tuna.  Then we  enjoyed a salad, the name I cant recall, which had corn nuts and again, a light vinaigrette dressing. Finally, we ordered a spread of tacos wanting to try a wide variety. The moist, flavorful carna asade taco was my favorite, with the fish and veggie tacos on hand made corn tortillas a close second place.  The special, a seared tuna taco, was my least favorable.  While it was well made and the fish tender and fresh, it was too large of a chunk and really should have been diced or sliced.

We ordered the Street Corn as a suggestion from our server, and wow was it good, spiced up, well cooked ( steamed??) with perhaps cheese on top. A great addition and actually should come automatically with any meal. It really is that good. 

Feeling thoroughly stuffed, we split the orange cake along with fresh brewed decaf. The cake was full of orange flavor, zest, and the right amount of sweetness.

The ENTIRE bill for two was  73 bucks. Well worth it and frankly a great deal- alcohol drinks, sodas, appetizer, salad, five tacos, desert, coffee x 2.  

Finally, kids below the age of 10 eat free.
