The food was pretty good, I got the lobster enchiladas .. But when you pay these kinda of prices, it is expected that you are paying for the service, which was pretty nonexistent.  It was not busy but we still waited too long to receive our drink order but the main problem for me was that after our server dropped of our meals, that was the last we saw of her until we asked for the check . No water was brought to the table after we asked nor did we get an offer for us buy another round of drinks. There were 3 of us dudes and we like to drink and here we are with empty glasses the whole time.
