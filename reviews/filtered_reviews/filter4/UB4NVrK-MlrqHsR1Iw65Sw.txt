We came to take advantage of happy hour and it was so worth it! The margaritas with coronita or pacifico were great we order one on the rocks and one frozen they bot were equally good!! 
Chips, bean dip, rajas and salsa are complimentary and are constantly refill through out your dinner experience. 
Our server Mary was very helpful suggesting items and helping us decide what to eat, over all we enjoy every bite and every moment!! Great place, service and happy hour!!!
