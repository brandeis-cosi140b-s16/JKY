We love El Encanto, its one of our go-to's, and for good reasons. The food is great, and our favorites are their Camarones con Salsa de Autentica, and Tacos de Pescado Asado. Their menu is very authentic, with more of a spanish flair vs. most of the a-typical greasy spoon mexican food we've had in Arizona). Great for kids as well, with their duck pond in the middle 'atrium' of the entire restaurant. Kids (and Adults) can buy food to feed the animals at the front desk for 50 cents, and theres a lot of animals to feed with ducks, fish, turtles , geese and more. They're also great for larger parties, we've had upwards of 14 without an issue. Highly recommended for some of the best mexican food in the Phoenix area!
