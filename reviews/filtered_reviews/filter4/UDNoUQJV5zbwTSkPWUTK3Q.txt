day drinking in scottsdale is a past time i have not appreciated enough. on this wonderfully cool afternoon, we were walking home and a friend in our group says "hey, you want to get a drink". how novel....

it was kinda quiet, but of course, the bar area was rowdy with sports fans. we picked a booth near the entrance. our waitress was very friendly, even though all we were doing was drinking and eating the free chips. i had 2 house margaritas and thought they were a bit sweet for my liking. but it had alcohol and salt and that's all i cared about. 

a great little drinking spot and surprise, they've been there a while...a true novely in scottsdale.
