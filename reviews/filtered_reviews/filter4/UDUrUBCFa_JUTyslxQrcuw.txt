I don't normally go to restaurants looking for an "authentic Mexican" or an "authentic Italian" flavor, although I'll note it if I find it.  What I'm looking for is good taste, and on my 2 visits to Macayo's  when I was in Phoenix, I found it.

On my first visit, I had a very tasty two tacos, beans, and rice.  On my second, I had the enchilada sampler.  This latter was not entirely my taste, although I still thought it was good quality.

I have been to quite a number of Mexican places around the San Francisco area, and this was my first experience at Mexican food in Arizona.  I was quite pleased with the food here--and I got a LOT of it.  For what it lacked in "traditional" or "authentic", it made up for in flavor and meal size.  The decor at Macayo's was a bit loud, but not unlike some of the other Mexican places I've been to.

This is a great place for good single, couple, or family dining.  Give it a try and taste for yourself.
