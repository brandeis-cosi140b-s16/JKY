Great food...great service!  If you don't know how to eat Mexican food with a flour tortilla you don't belong in this restaurant.  The complimentary chips, salsa, retried beans, are awesome.  I recommend the homemade guacamole.  It is made fresh right at your table.  I Ordered the mochacca breakfast and enjoyed it.  Next time I'm back in Vegas I will definitely try the dinner menu.
