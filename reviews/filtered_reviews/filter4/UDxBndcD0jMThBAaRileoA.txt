Great addition to the neighborhood!  The tacos are awesome.  Huge selections of "salsas".  They are really good, but less traditional than a tomato based salsa.  They are creamy (they need to mark the dairy free ones on the menu) and act more as taco sauces.  The burrito was massive; way too big for one person.  So-so happy hour, but the drinks sound yummy.  Beer, wine, and tequila only.  Super cute inside!
