Overall great food with a good selection of items. Both tacos I ordered were very good and extremely fresh. The chips were good and the salsa bar was the best I have seen. 
I would for sure go back and recommend this place to anyone having a taco craving. 
The only negative and reason for 4 stars instead of 5 was that parking was not good and it is a little hard to locate, even though it is right on 16th street.  
Again, overall great food with reasonable prices and makes for a great lunch.
