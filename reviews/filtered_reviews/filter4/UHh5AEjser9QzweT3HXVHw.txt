I originally wrote a review for this place when they were a block away from this building. 

Nothing has changed, the food is still delicious and the service is just as good. Although we haven't had a sit in lunch/dinner, only take-out they have expanded their menu. I can't wait to try more!

BYOB: $4 per bottle of wine and 50Â¢ per bottle of beer!

Previous review:
My coworkers and I decided to make it simple for the cook and ordered three Shrimp a la Diabla burritos for take out. Nah, that just happened that way.
The food was waiting for us after 25 minutes. They came with three containers of salsa; which we used, because we like our faces to melt off we were hoping these were spicy, and they were. 
The burrito itself was delicious, with or without the hot sauce. The price is great, the burrito is huge and now I'm ready to take a nap.
