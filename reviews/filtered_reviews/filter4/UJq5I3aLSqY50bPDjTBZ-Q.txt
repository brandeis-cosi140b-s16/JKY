I really liked this place. Reason for 4 stars- we walked in and the hostess said "sorry we are not taking any other parties for tables tonight" I then said how we've been dying to try this place and may we sit at the bar, she was like sure... 
They were busy and I get it, however it was only 8pm on a Saturday evening. 

Other than that, the bar staff was fantastic- the drinks were unique and decently priced. Three words will change your life forever here- CHICKEN TORTILLA SOUP. The taco was good but the soup WON! I definitely cannot wait to return (hopefully they will seat us next time :p)
