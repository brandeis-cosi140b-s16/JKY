This place is amazing!  I have met Ralph (the owner) and his son numerous times.  I am always treated with a smile and good stories.  The family run business does a good job bringing Hatch chili to the valley.  Unlike Arribas, there is no soupy, chicken-stock laces salsas here, just good spicy kick with amazing flavors.  I even go as far as to but their hot salsa by the quart for use at home.  I highly recommend the pork green chili burro... comfort food at its best.  I also like the tamales (except that they get microwaved).  But overall, a warm vibe with cool employees and good food.
