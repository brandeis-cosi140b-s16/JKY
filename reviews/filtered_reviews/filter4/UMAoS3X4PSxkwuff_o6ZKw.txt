Great happy hour deals.  The atmosphere is nice.  The music is amazing.

My only complaint focuses in on the Mahi Mahi tacos.  I understand it's Arizona and all, but please don't be stingy with your fish and expect us to pan out $4 per tiny taco.  What a ripoff!  I explained the situation and how ripped-off I felt, and they were understanding...but I'll know better next time.
