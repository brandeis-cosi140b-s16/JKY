Once again, the Yelpers helped us when in unfamiliar territory.    We stayed a couple of nights at the 3 Palms and ended up having breakfast here and satisfying a late night munchies craving.  

As stated in other reviews, this place is VERY clean. N Ot to say other places are not, but you don't feel like you are in a sleazy taco joint with questionable sanitary practices.

We both had a simple breakfast burrito for lunch.  While it was nothing to write home about, it was tasty and filling.

Our late night snack was a big time pleaser!  Had a few tacos and and an order of the rolled tacos with guacamole.  Perfect!  Would eat that same order for breakfast, lunch and dinner!

If you are in that neck of the woods, drop in and order up some good Mexican fast food!
