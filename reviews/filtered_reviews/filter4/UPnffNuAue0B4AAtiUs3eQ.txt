Wow!! The place does not lie! The name says it all - gourmet tacos!! 

Upon arrival, I noticed the authentic touch with the outside doors - 3 to be exact. Check out the pics! Then coming inside, I see vibrant colors with matching works of art affixed on the walls. A patio is also available if you're looking to soak in some sunshine. 

Once seated, we got a basket of warm chips. They have an amazing salsa bar with a variety of flavors to try. Some of the ones we tried were the: pecan, cilantro, La Santisima salsa, chipotle, radish of some sort, guacamole, and more. So fun to try different spicy kick flavors!

Today I tried the Aztec Tinga taco (a Mexico City specialty), which is shredded chicken with tomato, onion, and Aztec chipotle salsa. It's got a little spice, but balances out with the double corn tortilla. This taco was meaty and juicy! 

The other one I tried was the Mayan Cochinita Pibil taco - a Yucatan speciality! This was a true fork tender pork shoulder with achiote rojo topped with lime marinated onions and salsa Habanera Maya.  Lots of meat!! Love! 

I also had the chance to try the La Santisima special taco with chicken and cheese and a steak filled taco. Both were amazing as well. Each of these were ordered a la carte ($4-$5 each). If you order 2 of the same, you get it with a side of rice and beans. The beans have a bit of spice and the rice included kernels of corn. Yummy! 

Finally, I ordered their version of a horchata. It is unlike any other horchata I've tried! It's my first one that included fruits and pecans! Quite unique and refreshing! 

I'm looking forward to trying the other gourmet tacos and hopefully will make room for the flan!!
