Okay, I've been here twice now since learning from their website about the Chipotle commitment to "Food with Integrity."  What does that mean?  It means, among other things, that 100% of the chickens they use are raised without the use of antibiotics.  100% of their pork comes from naturally raised pigs that are fed a vegetarian diet and never given antibiotics.  And 85% of their beef comes from naturally raised cattle (only because the supply presently cannot meet the demand).  

All this time, Chipotle was right under my nose and I'd been snubbing it because I assumed their food had no more integrity that Taco Bell's.  

Now I've been this location twice within the last week.  The first time I got  a barbacoa burrito bowl with black beans and rice.  The second time I got the same thing with the chicken instead of the barbacoa.  Both times I was really hungry and could only eat about half of the meal in one sitting.  So I got two meals out of it for a reasonable price.  Both times, the food was delicious and I felt like I was eating a healthy, nutritious meal.  

I also got, both times, the tortilla chips with guacamole.  Their tortilla chips are made fresh and have a really great, subtle lime flavor.   The guacamole is also made fresh.

This location is clean and well-maintained, and I have had no problems with the employees here.  They have been helpful and friendly.  From now on, Chipotle is going to be a regular stop when I want a quick, delicious, healthy and hearty meal.
