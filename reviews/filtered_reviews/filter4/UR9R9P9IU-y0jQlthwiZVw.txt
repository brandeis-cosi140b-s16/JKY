I ate lunch frequently at America's Tacos on 7th Ave, by my old office, so I was thrilled to see an American's open in my Downtown Scottsdale 'hood. 

I cannot not overeat at this place.  I [over]order the same items pretty much every time: a cuatro for the table - salsa, guacamole, and bean dips with chips - and a regular carne asada burrito.  If you haven't experienced cotija cheese and lime on corn on the cob before, open your mind and mouth to America's Corn.  MAN I love that stuff.  I love their salsa and guacamole.  And the carne asada....Mmm.  Sometimes I wish my burrito was bit warmer in terms of the temperature, but otherwise it's awesome. 

America's Scottsdale features a large back patio shaded by mature trees.  I've only been to the Scottsdale location in the evening.  At that hour I never have a problem with parking and the restaurant has never been crowded, inside or out.

The service is always extremely friendly and helpful.  

I couldn't ask for a better neighborhood taco shop!
