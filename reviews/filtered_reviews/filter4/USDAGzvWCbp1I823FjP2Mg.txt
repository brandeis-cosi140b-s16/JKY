Yes, it's very good food. Yes, they have lots of great choices. Yes, it is authentic mexican food in the middle of Illinois.

But, it's always packed and they are continually raising their prices. It was once extremely cheap and I went there a lot. But now I prefer Huaraches Moroleon for better food, better prices, and a better atmosphere. 

Maize is still delicious though.
