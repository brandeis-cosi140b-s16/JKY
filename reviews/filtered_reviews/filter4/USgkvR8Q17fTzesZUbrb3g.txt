Have been here twice within  4 days.  Both times were excellent.

On Sunday hubby and I took friends there for brunch, and we were delighted.  I ordered the Barbacoa enchiladas, and the dish was very, very good.  Everyone at the table truly enjoyed their meal, and we had excellent service.

Today I dined here with a friend and the Asian dumplings -- delicious.  Even though this dish is listed in the appetizer section it made an excellent meal for me.
