My husband and I attended a Yelp Brunch at Vida on Cinco de Mayo.  We really enjoyed it!  The ambiance was very nice, the service was excellent, and the food was delicious!  We had the Guacamole and Chips, Beef Brisket Tacos, and Carnitas Tacos and everything was fantastic!  I am super picky about rice and theirs was really good!  

Can't wait to go back with the rest of the family...I know that they will love it, too!
