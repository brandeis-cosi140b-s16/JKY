First time here and all i can say is that i liked it a lot...

We were driven here after watching the show Man vs Food.

The Torta del Rey is awesome and huge...

The Mango "agua fresca" wasnt that good due that the mango wasnt in season so it was a bit sour...

Service from the waitress was excellent..

In general, its the most mexican like food i've tasted here in AZ...
