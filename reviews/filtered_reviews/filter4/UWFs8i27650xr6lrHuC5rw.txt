Came here on a Monday morning dying to get food in my stomach. The place opens at 11. The service was great. Our server made some great recommendations. To be honest I wasn't expecting to particularly enjoy the food, but I was pleasantly surprised. I got the carne asada burrito and the boy got the fish tacos. Both were delicious and very fresh. She also recommended some weird margarita which I hear was delicious (tequila is just not my thing). We also got the chips and salsa and guacamole. The guac was soooo good! Not overly spicy, but not bland either. Was bummed that we had so much food we couldnt finish it. Will definitely come back get some chips and guac and have some beers next time I'm in Vegas! All in all is was definitely an enjoyable lunch to get the day started!
