I love that every time I walk in to a Chipotle, no matter how many people are in line I still walk out within 5 mins. Their veggie bowl with brown rice, fajita style onions with bell peppers, black beans (the refried beans have bacon), corn, salsa, hot sauce, sour cream, guacamole, all topped with lettuce is ALWAYS on point. The staff is friendly and attentive. I love coming here.
