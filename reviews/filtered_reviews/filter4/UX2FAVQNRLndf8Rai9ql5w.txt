Went for dinner prior to the DBACKS game. When you pull into the parking lot there is very limited parking, but they do have complimentary valet service. You almost have to use this service because without it there is no place to park. My son and I both got the Roikerij Steak which was amazing. My wife and mother-in law were not that hungry so they got some appetizers. My wife said it was just "OK". The ambience in this place is excellent. Great place for a romantic dinner. The service was very good. We had what seemed like 2 servers. One took our order and the other checked on us. They seemed a but out of synch as our server would ask us a question, then the other would ask the same question. I did not go with 5 stars because I think the price is a bit over the top.
