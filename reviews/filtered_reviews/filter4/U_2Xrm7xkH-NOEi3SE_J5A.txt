I love this place how its tucked away and hidden! A fan of both Richardson`s and The Rokerij, Dick`s Hideaway doesn`t disappoint!!
 
Came in recently with some of my work friends for brunch, and needless to say I most definitely plan to return!! I had the tenderloin benedict, flavorful and juicy! And loved their mimosas! My other two friends ordered the jalape√±o eggs benedict and the other had the huevos rancheros,both were raving about their dishes as well. My only question was, why the hell did I wait so long to eat here?! Especially when I live so close!!
