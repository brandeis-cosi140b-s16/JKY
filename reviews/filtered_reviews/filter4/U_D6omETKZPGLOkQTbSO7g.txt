The valet at the Biltmore recomended this place.  There was a live band performing the night we ate there.  We sat outside in the patio area.  We ate late enough that the temperature was comfortable enough to eat outside.  There are some creative dinner options on the menu.  There are the traditional clasics, but there are also some twists.  The chips and salsa were good.  The red salsa was very tasty.  The green was just ok.  I was disappointed with the queso fundido because it came with spinach premixed in.  I had the beef short rib tacos.  The meat had a great sauce on it and was tender.
