$2 dollar tacos on the strip? AWESOME!!! I tried to place recently due to the rave reviews on yelp. I was pleasantly surprised! I come from Los Angeles, and know all about "King Taco" and "El Taurino" and been to taco places in Mexico itself. I would say this place is in the same category as "El Taurino" if not better. 

Their Adobada (spicy pork different from Al Pastor style) with everything on it, is my favorite! I can eat 6 of these easily lol. I tried the "Taco el Lengua" (cow tongue) and was thrown off a bit. (I love cow tongue in Japanese and Korean BBQ) but the taco version is a little... well tastes like a mushy tongue lol. I wouldn't order that again.

Avoid this place on Friday nights and Saturday nights unless you want to deal with dozens if not a hundred drunk loud clubbers who are literally throwing up outside in the parking lot... :( 

Also their "Horchata" and other mexican drinks are not made fresh or from scratch.  (kind of a bummer really), they use the mixed syrup machine dispensers. I guess I'm spoiled because where I come from the Horchata is always made fresh daily.
This is my go to spot for late night tacos after work. If you are just visiting, I definitely recommend this place if you are a taco lover such as myself.
