Came here on a Thursday with a group of buddies and sat up in their tent things? Bria was our server and we had the best service! She was super personable and on top of it even though she seemed busy. We've been here before and have had crappy service so it was so refreshing to have good service! I'd recommend asking for her if your going here!
