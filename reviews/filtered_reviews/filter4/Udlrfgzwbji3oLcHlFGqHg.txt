I wish my home town of Columbia, SC had a fish taco place just like this, I love fish tacos. Cabo had a ton of energy when I went, the mood and the atmosphere was hip and quaint like the neighborhood it was nesseled in, on a small corner of Charlotte. The service was fast and friendly. Cabo puts a good foot forward with it's corn salsa and chips that come out before meal, I could have just ate this. When I received my beer battered fish taco my first thought was wow is that food or art. My second thought when I bit into it was grease is the word is the word, can I get a towel over here. Over all Cabo was good I might come back sometime, but I think I'll ask them to towel off my taco next time.
