One of my fav's for Taco Tuesday and for hanging out during the weekend nights! This place is more of the laid-back bar/hangout spot which I love! Happy our is always a good time. Staff is friendly and easy-going. The place itself has always been clean, even the bathrooms! I love the big outside patio and did I say their Taco Tuesday?
