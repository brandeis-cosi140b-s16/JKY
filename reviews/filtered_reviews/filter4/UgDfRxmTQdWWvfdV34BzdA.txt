Mexican food in Arizona, it can be a bit scarry for me since I love California mexican food...yes theres a difference.  I ordered the relleno and enchilada, the relleno was spicy and stuffed with tomatoes, cheese, pork and some kind of spicy sauce...it was spicy yes but very good.  The enchilada was stuffed with chicken and also very good.  I had a margarita that was made very well and on top of all that the service was excellent!
