Husband and I took the in-laws here and he has been back since. Love the sweet corn tamales - if you go, you must try these. Also, the margaritas are very good. I really enjoyed my shrimp enchiladas. They had almost a dozen shrimp in them, which was great, b/c it drives me nuts when you get a shrimp dish with like three shrimp in it. I mean, they are called shrimp, by their nature they are small, so putting three in a shrimp dish is counter intuitive. Husband enjoyed the street tacos, which were also excellent. 

Jalapeno Inferno is also nice for its sedate atmosphere. Unlike a lot of other Mexican places, there is a refreshing lack of colorful parrots, which makes it perfect for a nice dinner with out of towners, esp. those who already feel that everything Arizona must feature cacti.
