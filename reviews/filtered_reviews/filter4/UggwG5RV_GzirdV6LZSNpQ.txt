Starters were guacamole and queso fundito.  Queso was good, I prefer my guac with cilantro and this did not have any but different places do their own thing.  It was solid none the less.

My main course was the Yucatan pork which was braised very tender with sweet plantains, guacamole (see above) black beans, and rice.  The black beans and rice were rather pedestrian but everything else was so good they were just sort of overlooked.

Finished the meal with some nice chilled Don Julio 1942 which is always a luxury.  I had a margarita earlier in the meal and was not super impressed.
