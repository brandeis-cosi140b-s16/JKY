Does anyone else think chips and salsa are part of the foodgroups? I do!
Yes this is a hole in the wall, yes it is in a scetchyer "hood"  but it will be worth your time. 
Margarita's...check out their 2.99 deals or just for the heck of it get a piture and share with some friends. 
The atmosphere can be loud (decor and patrons alike), but for this reason, it is a good place to bring kids because no one cares when your kids are as loud as your adults.
On to the food....Chimis are great, my husband always gets the heart attack style (this is not the name) chimi with white cheese sauce.
There are a lot of vegitarian options here for all you non carnivores.
If you are looking for good mexican food and mostly chips and salsa that should be part of the food pyramid, then Via Delosantos is your place.
