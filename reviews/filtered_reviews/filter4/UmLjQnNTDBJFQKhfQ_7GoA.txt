I love the decor and ambiance of this place. It's dark, lively, and fun. Just walking into the entrance is eye candy. Sarah surprised me with dinner here on a very windy day. Street parking only. It was on a weekday and fairly empty, so we had no problems with changing our reservation multiple times.

Right away we jumped on some chips and guac. Their guacamole is very good, I was a fan of that. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered some tacos, their carnitas to be exact. Every Mexican restaurant has their own version of carnitas and these ones weren't too bad. I just felt they were missing something, it didn't have that oomph.

Check out the awesome sink in their bathroom! It's unique. Service was pretty good, but it wasn't busy so that's predictable. Seems like a fun place to drink and good for large parties with the outdoor patio area. But the food can be improved upon.
