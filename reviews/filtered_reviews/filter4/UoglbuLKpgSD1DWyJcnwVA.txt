I'm a fan. While I usually just sample various tacos, today I got the Pollo Coco and it was amazing. 2 chicken breast w/ a wonderful sauce served w/ pine nuts and a side of mashed potatoes and mixed veggies. I will be trying more entrees from now on. Good food, good service and an overall enjoyable experience as usual. Love the brisket, chicken and carne tacos. So many choices of tacos also. Nice patio to sit outside in Old Town.
