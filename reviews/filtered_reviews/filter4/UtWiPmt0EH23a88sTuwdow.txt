We love the food and the price point!  Best place to have a date night!  

Things they can improve on include: 
The decor needs updated on the inside and could be more modern/refined.  
The drink/desert menus at the table are grimy and need redesigned.  

Things we love:
Chicken taco salad is awesome!  That's what I always get!
My husband try's something new every time and he's like everything! 
Happy hour deals are great!
Margaritas are really good!
Hardly ever a wait to be seated and food comes out fast!
