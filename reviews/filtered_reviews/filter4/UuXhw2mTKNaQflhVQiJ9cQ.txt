If you know ahead of time what you're getting in to it may be better, but we stumbled upon this place when we were on our way somewhere else for brunch (we have only ever experienced brunch here) and the roads were unexpectedly blocked off.
The food we had was all perfectly good it was sangria sunday and the white sangria pitcher we downed was delicious! 

My only complaint is that for the price I've definitely had better brunch around the city. The food was not bad at all but just a little more pricy without a distinct WOW factor!

They have a grea patio and the service was all very friendly!
