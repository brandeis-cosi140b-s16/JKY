I haven't been to this location in a LONG TIME! I tend to frequent the one on Carnegie in Henderson or the one that's less than 5 minutes from my house in Summerlin.

Place was packed on a Friday night, and there seemed to be an overwhelming number of people celebrating their birthdays this night!

The food was good. I ordered the vegetarian burritos and they were awesome! The server was pretty good too. Paid good attention to how we were behaving at the table. Checking on us quickly in the beginning, but noticed we were too busy conversing so switched to checking on us every ten minutes or so. I also think he had a thing for my date, as he never really looked at me when he came to check on us! lol! All good. Just shows he has good taste!

All in all, a great experience and I would eat here again, but have to be honest when I say I'd go to Carnegie or West Flamingo locations first. Nothing against this location, just my preference of area and atmosphere.
