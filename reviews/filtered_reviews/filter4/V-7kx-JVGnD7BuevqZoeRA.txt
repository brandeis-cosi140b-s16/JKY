We went here for brunch today. My husband and I shared:

* Chilaquiles Rojos
Chicken or Vegetables layered tortillas , Oaxaca cheese, red ranchero salsa

Inca Salad - Single 5 / Share 9
Quinoa grain, fresh corn, dried cranberries, pepitas, Yulu seeds, tomato, arugula, mint, basil, red onion and lime with a herb vinaigrette

Plus got the guac. 

Fresh and delish! I don't normally post on Yelp, but this place is new and we want it to stay open! It was one of the New restaurants listed in the Phoenix NewTimes magazine.
