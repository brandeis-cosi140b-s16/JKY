I was walking around Romare Bearden park and decided to take the 20 minute walk to this place for some good Mexican food.  I hadn't been here before and decided to give it a shot.  I ordered the tofu quesadilla and some chips and salsa; the quesadilla was delicious but I'm REALLY disappointed that they served bagged tortilla chips.  WEAK.  The salsa was at least flavorful so that made up for it a bit, but you guys need to do away with the bagged chips and make them homemade.
