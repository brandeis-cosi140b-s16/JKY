Their tacos are fantastic! Plenty of choices to pick from. And who can beat a $2.00 taco Wednesday night? I had the barbacoa and carne asada, both fresh ingredients and great flavors bursting in my mouth with each bite. 
The only thing that could make this place better is $2.00 PBR on tap. But I suppose a $5 Four Peaks Sunbrew in a can is tasty too.

Great intimate concert hall with very talented musicians, only downfall is the really drunk people spilling drinks on you. If you don't mind the occasional alcohol showers, you will no doubt have a good time.
