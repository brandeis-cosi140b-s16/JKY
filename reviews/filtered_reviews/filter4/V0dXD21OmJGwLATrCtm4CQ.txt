I like two kinds of breakfast burritos, depending on which mood i'm in: 1) A burrito loaded with spicy meat, peppers, cheese, potatoes, eggs, everything! Usually doubles as lunch. Usually hurts afterwards. 2) A super breakfast-y eggy, cheesy burrito with a decent yet not overwhelming amount of meat, and a more stomach-friendly amount of spice.

Burrito Company is the latter, and they do that type of burrito well! I like  to order the egg, bacon, and cheese, then add in as much salsa as I'm feeling like. The salsa here is thin but full of flavor, and also cilantro. It will clear your sinuses but not burn your mouth. The chorizo is also yummy, but the orange grease isn't all that appealing. 

Aside from breakfast, the food is good but not authentic. Think Filibertos but not as greasy and no russian-roulette food poisoning games. The Super Nachos are loaded with cheese, salsa, guac, and sour cream and will be appreciated by nacho lovers everywhere. The box it comes in weighs over a pound. The quesadillas are made on the giant tortillas folded over and over. Tasty and almost sure to induce a Mexifood-nap. 

Burrito Company is worth a visit for a breakfast burrito, and is one of the most well-known spots in the area- it is one of the oldest businesses in the strip mall in which it resides. Stop by, support a local business, and enjoy the food!
