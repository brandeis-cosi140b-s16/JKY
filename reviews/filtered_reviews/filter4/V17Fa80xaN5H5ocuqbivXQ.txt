Yes, it's a chain. But it's a Texas chain that opened it's first restaurant on 6th Street in Austin. That's street cred in my book. I've been to all their Austin locations, but now frequent the one off Mill Avenue in Tempe. Went for lunch just this afternoon as a matter of fact, and it always amazes me how I forget how good the food is between visits, even the complimentary corn bread. Today I ordered the Blackened Catfish Tacos with black beans and rice. Yum. I also recommend the Wild Mushroom Enchiladas and Baked Seafood Enchiladas.
