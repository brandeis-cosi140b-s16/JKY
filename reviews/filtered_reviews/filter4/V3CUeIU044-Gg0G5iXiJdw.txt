I had to revisit this restaurant again with three people who had never eaten there....and was NOT disappointed!

We had a great time - I ordered the same dish which was still amazing! 

This time around we had a couple of bottles of Sangria which we fell in love with. 

This is my favorite casual restaurant in all of Vegas to date!
