HUGE menu with a mucho grande selection of south of the border culinary delights!  I usually go for the basic combo plates and I've never been disappointed.  Their enchiladas are my favorite, but then again ... If it has melted cheese in it, on it, or near it, I am going to order it.

They give you fresh tortilla chips and their house salsa plus bean dip upon arrival, and it is all mucho yummy, although the salsa is a little HOT for this gringette.  I'd prefer pico de gallo, but that is just me.

Very good Mexican food served in a lively environment by a friendly staff.  And their homemade tortillas are completely addicting -- You have been warned.
