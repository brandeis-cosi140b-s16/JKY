As usual, I ended up coming here based on the bookmark part of the Yelp phone app. I bookmarked this place awhile back because of all the check ins from my Yelp friends and couldn't help but notice the four and a half star rating. Judging by the name, you wouldn't think it was a Mexican joint.

As soon as I walk in I am greeted by Frank (or should I say Phrank?) himself and asked if it was my first time. I guess me looking for some kind of menu on the wall gave it away. He directed me to the menus on the counter. He briefed me on some of the popular items that people get. The thing that stood out to me was that anything on the menu whether it was breakfast or lunch was available all day. That's a major plus if you ask me because who doesn't want a breakfast burrito for lunch sometimes?

Anyways, I went with the Adobada Burrito because im trying to cut down on red meat so pork is the next best alternative. The burrito itself had shredded chunks of tender pork mixed with some rice and beans. The pork itself was a bit salty but was still edible especially with the green, red, and spicy red sauces that came with it. All were excellent when you pour some on the burrito.

Based on the menu, I will definitely be back to try some of the others that people have mentioned. The only thing that I find negative might be the hours. 8 am to 5 pm. So if I wanted to take my fam for dinner, it wont work. I guess based on the location, they are only busy during the morning til late afternoon. I guess you cant have everything.
