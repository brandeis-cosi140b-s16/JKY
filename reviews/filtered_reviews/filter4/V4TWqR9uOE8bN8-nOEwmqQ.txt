Delicious.

This is Mexican Barbeque at its purest.  You have two meat options:  chicken or beef.  There's no fancy orange-spiced, or other-spiced flavors here.  They offer two things and those two things are so good.

The chicken was greasy, but you know what?  I didn't care.  

The main attraction was the beef.  It was so good, I didn't want it to end.  It was one of those moments where I hadn't eaten all day, and when I dove it, I was silent.  I wouldn't have answered my phone.

I got the most expensive thing (I think) that they had there and it was like seven dollars.  It came with chicken, beef, onions, tortillas and beans.  The beans are, meh, so-so and the tortillas are perfunctory but the real star is the barbeque, that's what you come for.

The chicken is greasy, but TASTY.  The beef is perfect.
