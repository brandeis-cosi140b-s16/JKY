My husband was craving fish & chips and being from SoCal, we decided to stop here for dinner with the kids.  It turned out to be a great idea.  We tried the calamari fries, chicken tortilla soup, clam chowder, fish & chips, shrimp & chips, and several different types of fish tacos.  Everything was delicious! We definitely felt like we were back in SoCal enjoying a meal by the beach.  The staff was helpful and friendly too.  It was extremely cold outside and the wait inside would be awhile, so they suggested we sit outside on the patio and they would turn on the heat lamps for us.  We weren't quite sure that sounded like a good idea but decided to give it a try.  It turned out great.  Not only did they move heat lamps to both sides of our table to make sure we were warm, but we had the whole patio to ourselves...and what a nice patio it was! We are excited to have found a great little spot not too far from home for the occasions when we are craving seafood.
