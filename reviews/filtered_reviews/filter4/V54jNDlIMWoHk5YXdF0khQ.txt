There are so many better, more authentic Mexican restaurants here in LV than this place, but I love coming here. The food is always tasty and comes out pretty quick. The service is pretty good as well. 4 stars because the drink prices are ridiculous. My favorites are the Chicken taquito app and the carne asada dinner.
