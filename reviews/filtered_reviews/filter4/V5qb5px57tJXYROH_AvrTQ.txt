Until the US government wakes up and opens up access to Cuba, this place will do nicely!  Fantastic mojito's!  Seriously dangerous!   You have been warned.

Great Cuban authentic dishes cooked with a flair and passion.  Live music on the weekends.  This place is a treasure!!!  Stop in for lunch for some great sandwiches and plantain chips!  One of my favorite spots.
