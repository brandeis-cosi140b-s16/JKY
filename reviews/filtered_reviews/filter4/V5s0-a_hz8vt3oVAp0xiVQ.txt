A few friends, my husband and I met up here on a Friday night for dinner and drinks. Arrived before happy hour ended, so enjoyed some guac and chips and a Dos Equis before the real meal. I had a fajita salad with chicken. The lettuce and veggies were fresh and the mango-pineapple vinaigrette was great! My husband had 2 Tinga tacos and they seemed a bit small; you'd think 2 tacos would be enough to fill you up but he was still hungry after finishing them. We stayed for almost an hour and a half just enjoying each other's company and the service was good the whole time.
