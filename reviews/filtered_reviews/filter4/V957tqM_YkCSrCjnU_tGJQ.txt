This place has changed hands since my last review, and definitely for the better.  Not only are the nachos better, but the happy hour and daily special prices are great.  For happy hour the ceviche is delicious and they have their house margarita BOGO with good beer prices as well.  Also Megan is still there and very helpful, although when the bar area is busy she ends up with too many tables for any one server, but she manages to still get around pretty frequently.

But let's talk about TACO and TEQUILA Tuesday.  Tuesdays this place gets 5 stars.  BOGO on tequila all night any brand, and this place has dozens of tequilas, my friend Alex is into tequila the way some guys are into scotch and loves the quality of several of their offerings.  And the street tacos which are corn tortillas made on site with high quality meat and served with salsa, are 3 for $3.33 or 10 for $10.  I could eat these every week and never be sick of them, the pork are the best, pulled meat with salsa and feta cheese on top.
