Iron worthy, though if  I had known that Old Town Whiskey has the same burger as Philadelphia's Village Whiskey I might not have given Distrito a chance. It was good, creative and quite different. 
  My Paloma drink came in 3 parts, grapefruit soda, tall glass of ice and a salted highball with tequila. I wasn't quite sure how to consume it, there were no accompanied instructions. The duck fundido was nice, huge and greasy beyond compare, but I like that. The truffle Haurache flat bread was good and the corn and cilantro sprouts made it. I fear the description of corn smut on the menu may not make it a top seller.
