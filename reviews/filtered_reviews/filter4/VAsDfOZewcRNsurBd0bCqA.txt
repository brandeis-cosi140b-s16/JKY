I love trying local hot spots around the Valley and found this one to be a great treat...although a little scary from the outside. Beforehand, I read about the owner and how she wanted to stay true to her roots by keeping the restaurant in the area it is rather than moving to Scottsdale or somewhere similar where this gourmet restaurant would fit right in. The food is amazing and the atmosphere is so quaint and cute. My husband loves Mexican food, but was a little upset when they put pomegranate seeds in the guacamole. After one bite though, he quickly changed his mind. It was the best guac he said he'd ever had. The rest of the food was just as superb! My only complaint is the long wait to be seated, but what can you expect with such a great place!?
