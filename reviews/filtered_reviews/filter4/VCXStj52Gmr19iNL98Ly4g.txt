Awesome place. After landing in Phoenix and having a craving for Mexican food, we drove to Mariscos Playa Hermosa. The restaurant was packed, but we had no problem getting a table. There was also a mariachi band that was playing music from 7-8pm, which was a pleasant surprise. I got an horchata to start off, which was amazing! Not too sweet, which a nice, but not overpowering kick of cinnamon. Highly recommend if you're a fan of horchata.

We ordered the Ceviche de Pescado as an appetizer, which was delicious and had a nice flavor from the fresh fish mixing with the cilantro and salsa. The fish was a little rubbery, but all the flavors still melded together well.

For our main courses, we ordered the Camarones culichi and Pescado a la veracruzana. Both came with a side of salad, homemade beans, rice, and fresh corn or flour tortillas. The shrimp was absolutely delicious, and the green sauce had a nice cilantro flavor to it. The only complaint we had was that the portion size was a little small for 3 people, and it was so good that we really wanted more. The fish was lightly breaded and sauteed, and was moist and succulent. The vegetables complemented the dish well too. 

If you're in Phoenix and have a craving for Mexican seafood, I highly recommend Mariscos Playa Hermosa!
