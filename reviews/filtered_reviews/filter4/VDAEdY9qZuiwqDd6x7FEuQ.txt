My husband and I LOVE Carolinas. I always crave it on Sundays (usually due to alcohol consuption the night before) and it is closed on Sundays, which is why it doesn't get 5 stars. :-) We typically order several servings so that we can eat Carolinas for days, especially Saturdays, so we can enjoy Carolinas on Sunday. 

My husband swears by the machaca burros and I love the bean tostadas or bean burros. Their breakfast burros, salsa, and tortillas are also wonderful! 

The only thing I don't love are their cheese enchilladas, because I don't like the enchillada sauce. Its not because it is bad, its just different from what I am used to. It is probably more authentic Mexican, than I am used to. Everything else is great and their staff is always friendly.

Be prepared to wait for a while, because the line can be quite long.
