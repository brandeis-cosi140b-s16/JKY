The food here was REALLY good! We shared the molcajetes with chorizo, beef, shrimp, and chicken. The dish also contained onion, peppers, cactus, and some kind of wonderful soft cheese. The dish is prepared and served in a piping hot cast iron bowl with tortillas on the side.

I particularly like the fact that the menu has options other than the standard greasy Mexican fare. I was impressed to see items I'd never heard of.

Our waitress was nice and enthusiastically described the dishes we were unfamiliar with.

The reason I couldn't give 5 stars is because of the ambiance. For me, the setting is an important part of the meal and this particular place was very seedy, divey, and dirty, with typical cheesy, tacky Mexican cafe decor (and the obligatory loud accordion music), in a sketchy neighborhood. The AC barely works, so it's unbearably warm in there. The bathroom was hideously dirty.

However, I would still go back for more and I recommend it to those who are in that part of Las Vegas and are into Mexican food.
