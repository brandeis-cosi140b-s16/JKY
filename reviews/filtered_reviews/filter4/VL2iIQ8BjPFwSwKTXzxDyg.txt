My Mexican girlfriend told me this was the best tacos in Vegas.  It's right by my house.  Last time I ordered the pork and it was good.  Today I got the steak tacos this time if flour tortillas and guacamole and sour cream.  Very good and probably the cheapest meal I ever eat at any given time. They also have my favorite drink Orange Bang. Haven't had it anywhere else other than Zippys in Hawaii.
