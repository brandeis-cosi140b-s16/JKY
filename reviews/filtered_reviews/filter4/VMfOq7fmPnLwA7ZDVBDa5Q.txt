Finally getting around to writing a review for one of my favorite local new mexican grub spots.

I highly suggest starting with the chips and salsa and a house margarita, for an entree I HIGHLY suggest the Osso Bucco! Some of the most tender, roasted pork I have ever had! Servings are well sized, and typically come with rice and beans. 

Overall pretty good service, however every once and a while you will get a slow waiter (typically when sitting outside). 

The happy hour is descent; however I think the Margaritas should be $1 or 2 cheaper based on quality and size. 

I love the outdoor seating and when the weather is nice you can't beat a margarita and mexican food next to the waterfall.

Keep up the good work!
