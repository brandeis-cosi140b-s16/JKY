If you're going for happy hour, get there on the earlier side of the time frame... The bar fills up quickly and you can only get the specials at the bar. I have to say that this is one of my new favorite HH spots! I went on a Tuesday night and they have half off bottles of wine, all night. Good thing since I needed something to wash down the delectable bacon wrapped scallops. 

The small plates deals during HH are great and such a great departure from the usual HH bites... I don't know about you but I'm tired of fried things and bruschetta. How much bruschetta can Phoenix handle?!
Yet, I digress. The small plates, from $9 to $5 a plate... such a good deal. We had the scallops I mentioned, really good scallops- worth the regular price of $9. We also had the Beef Tenderloin/Brie toasts, a little heavy on the brie, but the barkeep raved that they were the best thing he's ever had... (Maybe he should try Postino's toast?) Stuffed mushrooms were good, the taco combo plate- Great Mexico City style tacos, and I'm a huge critic of Mexican food and these were actually very good. Except 1, 1 was a wee bit too spicy for me. And I LOVE spicy. Maybe it was the wine bringing out the tingling on my tongue? We also got the oysters rokerij, similar to Green Mussels you would get at a sushi place... Very yummy. 

There were 3 in our party and we walked out of the place full and pleasantly toasty for $60 total- this isn't your Chili's HH but I'm more than willing to spend $20 for the atmosphere, the drink, and the food. We will definitely be back.
