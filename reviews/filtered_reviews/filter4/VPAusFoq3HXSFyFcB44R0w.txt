I had to update my review after I had their brunch!

You might not think to try Verde for brunch.  Who wants guacamole and chips at 11AM? (Our waitress did try to sell us on it!) However, Verde does a great job with their menu, and you won't miss your typical brunch far here.  

The menu at Verde is limited, and there are no substitutions....but you don't need any.  The stuffed french toast is amazing, and I paired it with a Bloody Maria (bloody mary with tequila) and a side of the sweet potato hash, which came out on a skillet with peppers and onions.  The portions were huge for brunch! My friends had the cornmeal pancakes and the biscuits and sausage which they said were delicious.

The drink prices are expensive for brunch, but it's still slightly cheaper than Point Brugge.
