I ate at Mama Maria's on 9-17-2013.  It's located on (6055) East Lake Mead and sets in a little strip mall on the south side of the road.  I would label this restaurant as a Mom & Pop type place. It's small, clean, and the wait staff is very accommodating.  The decor is a little dated with murals on the walls and christmas type lights strung across the ceiling.  I was hungry for refried beans and rice and my waiter Christian, suggested a dish with shredded beef, and my plate had a large portion of refried beans and rice as what I was hungry for.  I was served (immediately with)  salsa and fresh warm (4 flat) tortilla like "chips" that were good. The shredded beef was good and not overly seasoned, as was the rest of the meal.  I probably wouldn't drive across town just to eat at Mama Maria's but if I was in the area, I would defiinetly eat there when I was hungry for Mexican Food.  My order came to just under $9 with free refill on my drink order as I had ordered extra beans and rice, I felt the price was reasonable and the food was satisfying.
