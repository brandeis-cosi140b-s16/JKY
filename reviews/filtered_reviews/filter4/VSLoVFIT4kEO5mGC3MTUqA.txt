This is the kind of place you visit on Tuesdays because street tacos are ONLY $1. Even if it's not Tuesday, the prices are cheap!! I was craving me some tacos on a Tuesday so naturally I stumbled into this place. 

I tried their chicken taco, carnitas taco, and al pastor taco. My favorite was easily their al pastor. The meat was seasoned to perfection and the flavors were as an al pastor taco should be. Next favorite was the chicken and last was the carnitas. Normally I'm a huge carnitas fan but they must marinate their carnitas with something that doesn't really tickle my fancy. I still ate it, don't get me wrong but it wasn't my favorite. I ordered my tacos with a side of rice and beans and the total came out to be about $5.30 or something like that. Basically, an amazing deal. I didn't even finish all of my rice and beans because I was so full! Each street taco comes with two little tortillas. 

The staff was friendly and the rest of the items on their menu looked great too. They also have a bar where margaritas and beer can be ordered. They have happy hour so I can only imagine they have awesome deals. The inside is much more appealing than the outside so don't judge a book by it's cover! I will definitely be heading back there.
