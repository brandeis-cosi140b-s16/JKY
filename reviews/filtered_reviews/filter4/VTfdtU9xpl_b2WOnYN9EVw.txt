Twas a good place to start a relaxing lunch day in Vegas for a party of 4 before the madness of 15 began.

The margaritas here are the best I've had anywhere. They're so sugary sweet, but perhaps if you drink a few, the alcohol will catch up and kick you in the ass...maybe, but I didn't drink that many. I'm pretty sure they use real fruit to puree into it because you can taste the seeds from the raspberries. I enjoyed the mango best, but I'm partial to mango.

Service was great. Fajitas were yum and the guacamole - they make in front of your face! - was really fresh. 

We were easily put into food coma.
