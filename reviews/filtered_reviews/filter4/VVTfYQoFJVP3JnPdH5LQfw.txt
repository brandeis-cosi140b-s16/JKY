Woohoooo  My 100th Yelp Review!!!!  

Met up with a friend for dinner on a Tuesday night, he picked the placed and picked Arriba's, I was down for that cuz I do love the spicy food and here they cook with the Hatch Green Chile!!!  

I got to the table and was greeted by our waiter, Dave, who had a dimple it was cute when he smiled, haha.  

I ordered ice tea to drink, friend ordered coke, We placed our orders and got to talking and I swear it only took like 10 mins for the food to come out to us, it was like they were waiting for us to order LOL

My friend ordered an appetizer for dinner, really?? When I know I am going out to dinner, I order a meal and I don't like it with the other person just orders a app or something and they are like oh I'm not that hunger, dude did you forget we were going out to eat?? LOL and believe me that's what I told him too. Im not shy haha

I ordered the chimichanga plate and told Dave to make sure it was covered in the hottest sauce, bring on the heat baby! I had the machaca beef and Dave said if you like heat get a side of green chile for your dish, so I did what he said, let me tell you it was good!! It wasn't the nose running, eyes covered in tears, lips burning on fire kind of kick I was looking for it, but it did bring a little tear to my eye (just want to say, I like heat, and though it wasnt hot to me, it might be to others) LOL it was very good, it comes with sour cream, which was good because it was a like a cool mild balance also the plate comes with beans & rice and have to say both were delish! I normally don't like rice but this was perfect! 


Company, food, service was great! I look forward to coming back! 


(side note: I checked into Arriba's last night, but it's not showing up on profile today but it does on my app,,,oh well.)
