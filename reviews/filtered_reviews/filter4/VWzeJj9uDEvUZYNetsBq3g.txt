Great service, great food, but definitely over priced- over $10 appetizers, and over $10 desserts- it's prohibitive to eat anything other than the entrees but wanted to try everything anyways.

The guacamole was unique, I liked it with the pomegranate seeds.  Also free nice, soft fresh crusty french bread with a good olive/red pepper tapenade.

I got their Cochinita Pibil- slow-roasted pork as an entree.  It was a bit dry, not sure what the big deal is about, but came with nice roasted veggies and good mashed potatoes.  

The churro dessert was delicious!  Nice, hot, fluffy on the inside, but crunchy and cinnamon-sugary on the outside, drizzled with this goat milk caramel- had  a good scoop of vanilla ice cream with cut strawberries, a nice blend all together!

My server was excellent, he was the only waiter serving 10 tables, and he was super nice, attentive, right on time with everything, and pretty amazing-  I don't know how he dd it!
