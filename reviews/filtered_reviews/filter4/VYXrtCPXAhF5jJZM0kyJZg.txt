I always come to this place when I want to show friends a nice dinning experience. Staff is very friendly and attentive, I notice that the bussers are most attentive than the actual server which is a shame. Food prices are decent but seafood is a bit on the pricey side. Great place to come here on a birthday free tequila shot and the band comes over to your table and plays! The view they have of the strip is spectacular.
