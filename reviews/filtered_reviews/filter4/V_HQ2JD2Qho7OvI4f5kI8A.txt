hrm......... tortas........ 

so i'd been hearin bits n pieces about this torta place in central phx.....  
one day.... hungry me and david decides 2 check it out....... he wuz pretty happy they had a vegetarian torta...... and i gots me the Cubano.  (milanesa is like fried heaven)

they're pretty good, but not as good as Los Reyes de la Torta (formerly Torta La Pressa, the OG one on 7th st. and dunlap)

i'm still curious as to the other mexican food offerings besides the torta. 

o yea..... and i'd like 2 also mention, their fresh juices r tasty!!
