I had a romm in Planet Hollywood and upon checking in they gave me a coupon Yolos. Buy and entree and get a free margarita... So I decided to go there for lunch Why not right?! Free margarita? I'm so there!

I was in Vegas solo for a business trip so I sat at the bar. The bartender was friendly and recommended a few things on the menu, talked to me from time to time. She was very nice. I chose the street tacos combo since she said it was the best on their menu. She was so right! I had the combo of steak, carnitas & shrimp. I also received fresh salsa and chips, rice, beans and fresh guacamole. The shrimp had to be hands down my fave! The mango salso/sauce with it complimented the marinated shrimp excellently. 

The margarita was huge! Took me a while to finish it but I savored every last drop. =)
