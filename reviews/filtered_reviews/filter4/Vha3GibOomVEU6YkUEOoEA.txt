Cheese enchiladas compete for the best i've ever had... The tamales weren't that great.  I'm surprised they're mentioned in the name.  
The tacos are really saucy, which was a little weird, but really good. 
Food came out very quickly, and I have no complaints with the service.   I will definitely be back.
