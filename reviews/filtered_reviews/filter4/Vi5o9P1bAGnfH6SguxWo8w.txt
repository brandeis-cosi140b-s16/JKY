Fancy this is not.  It's more like a teleport to one of the restaurants you find a few blocks south of the border for lunch when on a shopping trip in Mexico.  I've been to Los Olivos several times over the last few years and it's decent, typical southern AZ mexican fare.  Get something fried.  Don't be in a hurry.  Bring a friend and enjoy their company while you munch and drink.  Los Olivios doesn't pretend to be something it's not - it's just serving everyday Arizona style Mexican food without fooling around.
