I'm so happy that Someburros finally opened up its North Scottsdale location; I used to live down the street from the Tempe location. It's a great place to get a quick Mexican bite that has better ingredients than a "bertos" style joint. The size of the burritos is not ginormous, but that's because you're paying for better and fresher ingredients. Fresher ingredients play a big part in compensating on the slightly smaller portions, but they boost the overall flavors and I can't complain about that. For around $6 I had lunch and didn't leave hungry.

The Scottsdale Air Park now has another good Mexican restaurant (Habenero's being the other) that will leave its customers full and content. Expect me here for lunch pretty often.
