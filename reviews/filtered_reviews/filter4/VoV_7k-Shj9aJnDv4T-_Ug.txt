Great local spot for some happy hour and food to keep you functioning enough to keep throwing back brews. They have this awesome drink called the dogma which isn't for the faint of heart that sets the tone every time I stop by that I always introduce to newcomers. The bar staff is always friendly and quick and the chips and salsa always on point.
