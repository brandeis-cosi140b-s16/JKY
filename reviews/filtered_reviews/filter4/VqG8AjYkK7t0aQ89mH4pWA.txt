Found in Arizona!!!  Really good Mexican food that is not a taco,burrito or enchilada!!!  We stopped for lunch at this mall restaurant not expecting much and it was a happy surprise.
We ordered maragaritas and appetizers.  Spend the extra $$ and get the Cab0o Wabo margarita than the house one; it's worth it.  The 'ritas were clearly made from fresh ingredients, although I would have like mine a little sweeter.  We ate the delicious guacamole, which was made table-side, and the ceviche, whiich was probably the best I ever ate.  The chips and salsa that were brought to the table were also very freshly made.
Our waiter was very capable.  The only downside was the hostess who seated us.  Not very friendly, never made eye contact and if she spoke at all, she mumbled.
