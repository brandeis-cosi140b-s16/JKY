One might think that a taco place attached to a strip club might not be the highest of quality but in this case? You'd be wrong.  It's pretty damn great.

The first time we went, we shared a pitcher of margaritas that are full of fresh flavor & there is NO skimping of the tequila - they are amazing.  The chips & 3 salsas that are brought to the table are super yummy.  We also ordered the queso fundido with mushrooms which was tasty.  Then there was the street tacos.  I ordered the carnitas tacos which were delicious.  The rice that came along with them was good (typical mexican side of rice).  We ordered a dessert to share - the fried ice cream.  It was really good.  I've had better versions but it was tasty.  Especially the banana sauce on the side.  The service we had this night was great.

As for the 2nd time we went, we happened to show up during happy hour.  Surprisingly enough, it was not as busy as the 1st night we went BUT the service was so much slower & worse.  It took forever to get drinks, to order, to get refills, our food, etc.  That was the only reason for the 4 star review instead of a full 5.  I'm hoping the next time we go, the service will be as good as the food is!
