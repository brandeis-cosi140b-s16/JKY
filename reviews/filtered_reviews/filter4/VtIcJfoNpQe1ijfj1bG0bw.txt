50/50 taco, different but yes! The chorizo wasn't overpowering like I thought it would.

Bacon taco, first bite the bacon was a bit over cooked. But the next bites were explosion of flavor in my mouth! The sauce!!

Steak taco, again first bite it was chewy. It also needed some help with the delicious green salsa.

Horchata, you gotta!! Sweet yum in your mouth.

The random karaoke from Dan was fun, lovin' the reggae. The price is a bit high than I'm used to, but well worth it!
