My friends and I (7 total) came in here after partying for 2 straight days. We needed hangover food which was breakfast food, but every place serving breakfast was closed and buffet was too much. I digress.
We passed by G y G and figured Mexican would be perfect. Plus they had tv's and the 9er game was on so we were sold.
I feel like we practically ordered half of the menu. Everything I got a taste of was great. I got the steak salad and loved it. 
The service was pretty good. The staff were very accommodating with our requests. My friend who is an avid 9er fan really wanted to watch the game so she requested for us to be seated by the tv and they made it happen.
The people dining while we were there were a riot. We made them take a shot of vodka because my friend had a bottle of Grey goose and they totally killed it.
Fun times
