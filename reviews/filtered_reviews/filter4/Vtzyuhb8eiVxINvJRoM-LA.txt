This place has become my favorite restaurant! Their tortilla soup is amazing! Also enjoy their chicken soft tacos! The tortilla chips are the best, thin and salty. Love, love, love their creamy jalape√±o dip and fresh salsa. My only complaint is that they need to make a mild salsa too for the kids and those that can't tolerate the spicy!
