This place is the Hawaiian Chipotle.  The service was outstanding, as we had many items for takeout and they were very helpful.  All the ingredients are extremely fresh and tasty.  The steak and Kalua pigs were excellent, however I found the chicken and fish a bit bland (that cost the 5th star).  Overall; a very good place to get fresh, tasty takeout that is a little out of the norm.
