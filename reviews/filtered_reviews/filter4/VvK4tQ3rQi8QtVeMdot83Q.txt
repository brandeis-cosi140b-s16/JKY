I think this place is pretty awesome.  I first came here along with coworkers because it was close to our work location.  Seems to be the go to for when the office is craving Mexican.  This place is clean and actually is pretty busy during lunch time.  

They first serve you with their chips, salsa, and bean dip...all very simply, amazing!  I think I get carried away with it when I go there because I get full before my meal even arrives.  

I usually like to order any of their burritos.  Its massive.  I first ordered the shrimp burrito because I thought it would be skimpy, boy was I wrong.  Shrimp in every single bite.  I was waay full by the time I got halfway. 

You can sometimes find Groupon deals for this place, so shop smart so you can save yourself some money to attempt to try the whole menu :)
