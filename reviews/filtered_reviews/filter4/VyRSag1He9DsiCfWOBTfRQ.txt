It's hard not to be instantly impressed with Taco Guild, with its beautiful placement inside an old church which they left tastefully in its original form. The food was as inspiring as the surroundings, with some of the best tequila and margarita drinks that Jesus ever transformed from water. The complimentary chips met all of my expectations of crisp and fresh chips, and the diverse mix of salsas that accompanied them were fresh and tasty (my chips were a bit over-salted though according to my blood pressure readings).

It was tough to settle on food choices, but I chose the scallop and shrimp ceviche, the cherry beef taco, and the Pork Al Pastor taco. Three solid choices. The ceviche was beautiful and perfectly seasoned with cilantro and onion, served alongside ridiculously addictive chips. The tacos were both great choices, but I will have to say that the cherry beef topped with bleu cheese was probably the single best item I enjoyed on my Phoenix Mexican gourmet tour.

The service was excellent and very attentive. I do believe Jesus is calling me to come back to this church again.
