Just came back from Vegas and of course had to go eat my lime-chile salad.  Still yummy!  Went back twice to eat my salad and each time also tried something else (steak quesadillas and chicken fajitas) . . . those were yummy too!  Went to both the one in Showcase Mall and Planet Hollywood Miracle Miles Shops and both of them had great service.
