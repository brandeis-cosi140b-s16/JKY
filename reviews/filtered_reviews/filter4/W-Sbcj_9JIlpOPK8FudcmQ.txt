Gallo Blanco is a terrific "fresh, local, organic" Mexican food option in downtown Phoenix.  You will not find melted-cheese-laden food here, which is a good thing!  I love the house salad and roasted corn.  In fact, I love it so much that I rarely get anything else.  The guacamole and chips are also very tasty.  My husband is usually the adventurous one, and he has loved everything he's ever eaten here--tacos and sandwiches, usually.  The reason I didn't give it five stars is that there are always flies bouncing off the windows inside the dining room when I've been there, which is a bit of an ick factor.  I know that flies are likely to head inside when you have patio dining too, but I hate to see them buzzing around while I'm eating.
