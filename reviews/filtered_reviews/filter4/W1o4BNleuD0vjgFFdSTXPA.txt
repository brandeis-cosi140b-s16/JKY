Plan for this meal.  You MUST plan for this meal because one sandwich is big enough to be food for the whole day.

The location is in a tiny strip mall just north of Dunlap.  It's nothing fancy.  Expect to see all kinds of people, lots of them, and they are all talking loudly.  This afternoon, when I was there, the place was packed with Hispanic families with lots of small kids, a bunch of older white haired people who must live nearby and their newspapers, a couple of tourists, and a nice kid who said his brother had sent him to pick up dinner.  He had never been there and looked around cautiously at the place until the waitress finally spoke English to him.

Since the place is named for the beautiful sandwiches they serve, I will start with those...  soft buns are loaded with different combinations of ham, breaded beef, pork sirloin, eggs,  chicken, cheese, guacamole, assorted peppers or chilies, tomato and sometimes a little onion... One torta is more than enough for 2 people.

They have taco plates with 3 tacos for under $5.  Their tacos come in varieties you may not have considered before... How about beef tongue tacos? or perhaps beef brains?  For the less adventurous, they have Hawaiian (beef, bacon, ham, bell peppers, pineapple, and cheese) or chorizo.

I like the shrimp quesedillas... also big enough to split. There are a lot of different shrimp dishes on the menu.  I should try a few others, but every time I walk in the door, I can hear the quesedilla calling my name.

They have fresh fruit drinks served in fishbowl sized goblets, and different kinds of fruit cocktail with whipped cream, honey or sweet cream for dessert.  They also have flan in different flavors.

I noticed a good breakfast menu that is served before 11 am, but I have never tried it. I think I would end up going home to sleep off the food if I tried to eat a big meal like that in the AM.
