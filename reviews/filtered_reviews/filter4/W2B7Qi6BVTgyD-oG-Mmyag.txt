Who doesn't love tacos? Ok even if you don't love tacos this place is still awesome. The adobada is insane.  This place gets extremely packed and it's a little chaotic inside but trust me, bear through the chaos and you will be rewarded with some of the best tacos ever. Oh and don't forget the Carne asada fries.
