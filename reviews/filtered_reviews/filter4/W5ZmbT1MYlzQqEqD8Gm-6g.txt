I Live 5 freakin minutes away and this was my first time here.....seriously? Well that's because the damn place is hidden away BEHIND the Williams Sonoma. I mean, Williams Sonoma has "stolen" thousands of my dollars and I never saw this place behind it.....I must speak with the architect! 

OK, so now I know what all the fuss is about. Authentic Mexican? Not a chance. However, this place does serve REALLY good Tex Mex! 

Fresh chips and excellent salsa? Confirmed! I added some delicious Chili con Queso and voila, excellent way to start off the lunch.

My friendly waiter made some recommendations and I went with them. He suggested the slow braised beef brisket, and I also selected a chicken fried steak taco. Man both were really excellent! Very flavorful with sweet/heat contrasting flavors. But while i knew the brisket taco would be good, the chicken fried steak was even BETTER! Halleluiah! Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Highly recommend this one!

Oh and the beans. Can forget about the charro beans. They have brisket in them with onions. Very savory and tasty. The only negatives was that the rice was average and the cole slaw sucked. But who cares when the mains are this good, right?

Overall a great first, but certainly not last, dining experience at Paco's Tacos!
