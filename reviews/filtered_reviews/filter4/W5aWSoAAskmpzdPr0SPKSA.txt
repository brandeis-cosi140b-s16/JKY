Big thumbs up for Sonoroa Mesquite Grill! My fiance got a Living Social coupon and as we pulled into the parking lot, we thought it might be a wash...but don't judge by the shady shopping plaza it's located in! The interior is clean and fresh, and the food is DELICIOUS.  I had the barbacoa burrito and my fiance had the carne asada burrito.  Both were amazing, love the grilled touch on the burritos! Beans are tasty. Guacamole is SO GOOD we were practically licking the container, and so is the red salsa.  

Only complaint - some nice fresh made chips with the guacamole would have made a big difference.    We'll definitely be going back!
