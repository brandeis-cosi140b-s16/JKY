My mom is obsessed with this place, I think mostly because of the huge bags of tortilla chips that she eats for days but anywho the only thing I ever order from here is the chicken or cheese red sauce enchiladas with rice and beans. I do looooove it and sometimes if I'm in the mood for their meat quesadilla/cheese crisp. Other than that I don't really like anything else. Their little containers of red salsa is eh and the large container of chunky red salsa is so gross! I don't know why my mom orders that too all the time but it's flavorless and it just has the wrong ingredients for red salsa.
I gave it a 4 star because I love my same exact meal every single time.
