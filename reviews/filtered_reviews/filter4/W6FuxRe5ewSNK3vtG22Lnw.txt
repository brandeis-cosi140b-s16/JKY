Bouncers beating the crap out of helpless drunks - check

Bouncers taking away my friends ID that was not fake - check

Overzealous, arrogant, and brutal. I got no problem with it. I'm a type A personality so I'm all for knocking someone down a peg if they step out of line. My ID is real, I control myself when I drink, and I'm not a hellraiser, so I've NEVER had a problem at Dos. The food is tasty and pretty cheap, they have every beer you'd ever want, and an awesome rooftop bar. One of my favorite bars in the area still, but I wish it were closer to the city. I hate not being able to let loose here on a count of drinking and driving.
