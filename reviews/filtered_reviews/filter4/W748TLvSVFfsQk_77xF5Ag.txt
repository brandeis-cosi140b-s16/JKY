Groupons make the world go round or they do in my world. We stopped by for some weekend lunch. Food was solid and service was too. The owner came around and made sure we were having a good time. Tried the chicken bowl and it was real good. Even got free chips and guac because I was wear slippers. Not a fan of guac, but it went well with their salsa.
