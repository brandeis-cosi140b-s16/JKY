I had been wanting to try this place for months but was reluctant because I hate dealing with the crowds and parking around ASU.  However, my wife and I decided to give it a shot Saturday afternoon.  For some reason there were no crowds and parking was a breeze.

The place is nice, quaint and clean.  Not like your typical taco shop or your local Filibertos.  Well I'm not saying that Fili's isn't awesome because it is, but ATS is just a tad bit different.  We sat outside which was great because the weather was beautiful.  It really was the perfect lazy Saturday afternoon lunch.

The food:

Guacamole - this was very fresh and good.  I like it a bit more spicy but it was still very good and I would order it again.  The chips were very good as well.

Shrimp Cheviche - I thought this was just ok.  Civiche really isn't my thing but my wife loves the stuff.

Pastor Vampiro - This was excellent.  I had never heard of a vampiro before so I had to try it.  The thing was loaded with good stuff and the meat was excellent.

Taco - My wife ordered a taco (I forget which meat was in it) and it was excellent.

America's Corn - This was my favorite part of my meal.  It was sooooo good.  Needed a sprinkle of chili powder though....

Anyway, everything was very very good.  All I have to say is that it is way over priced.  Like $2.25 for a real small taco is ridiculous in my opinion but I still think the place is pretty solid.  The service was fast, friendly and courteous and I will definitely be back hopefully soon.  Oh, and I liked their selection of hot sauces on the tables.
