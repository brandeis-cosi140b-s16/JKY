How did we not know about this place with our umpteen trips to Vegas? What a find! My hubby and I shared some chicken and shrimp fajitas. Yum, yum, yum!!! There is a tortilleria inside the restaurant where they are making fresh corn and flour tortillas! Before they bring your food, you are served with a generous bowl of corn chips, salsa, refried beans and a small dish of sautéed onions and jalapeños.If you mix everything together, what a fantastic combination! Be sure to save some of this fabulous onion and pepper combo for your fajitas. I'm not a huge fan of mariachis, mostly because they're so loud and in your face. There was a solo singer, not a mariachi, with a guitar and a lovely voice. The wait staff was fantastic too. They constantly check on you and are very happy to do so. Our waiter, Omar, was kind enough to tell me about a yelp coupon for checking in. This was great food, the house was packed, the service was excellent and we'll definitely be back!!!
