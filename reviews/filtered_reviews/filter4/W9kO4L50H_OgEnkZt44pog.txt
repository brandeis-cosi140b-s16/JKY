I went here for their Tequila tasting and Margarita class. The class was definitely worth the $20.00. You were in a group of about 10 people sitting at the bar. The bar is U-shaped so everyone had a good seat. It was a very fun and informative class. I thought it was really nice that the owner participated in the class. He is a very nice guy who also owns Tender in Lawrenceville so I will make sure to check that restaurant out next. In the class you sampled 3 types of tequila. All samples combined probably equaled 1 shot. You were also served chips and salsa with your tasting. At the end everyone got to make the restaurants signature margarita. We also got to keep the shot glasses. They also extended us their Wednesday happy hour of $3 half shots if we wanted to stick around to try more tequilas. I sampled a pink tequila aged in a wine barrel and an espresso tequila. Both were amazing. I will definitely be coming back to try their food and their happy hour specials!
