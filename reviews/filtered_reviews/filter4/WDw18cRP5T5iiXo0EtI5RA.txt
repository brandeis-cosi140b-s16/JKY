Best burritos around, and that's saying a lot from someone who can't get enough of chipotle. All of the burritos I have tried are awesome. Their tortillas are delightful, and the fresh salsa is to die for. My favorite is definitely the chicken burrito with green onion, peppers, and rice. The shrimp burrito is also grand. The staff could be friendlier, but service is quick even on their busiest of days. I love their new outdoor patio.
