I went in at 11:30 AM to beat the rush and got seated quickly and had my order placed within a couple of minutes.  Not more than 5 minutes later my food was ready.

I ordered the chimichanga with ground beef.  Nice mix of spices, but not too heavy which is what I like.  Some places tend to add too much to ground beef and it dominates the taste.  The rice has a pepper mix added to it which wasn't to my liking, but to each his own.  The beans could use more flavor or maybe some cheese on top to mix in.

The server and bus boy were both friendly and came around very often.  Overall the chimi was great, the place was clean, and the service was good.
