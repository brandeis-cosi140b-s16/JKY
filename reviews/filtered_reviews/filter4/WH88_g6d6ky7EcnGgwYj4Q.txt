Let's just say that if I'm going to be successful @ keeping my hour-glass figure, I need to stay far away from this place! But is this even possible when the food is so tempting and the chicken tastes sooooo good??!? 

The Queso Fandido came with flames hovering over it and the taste matched the awesome presentation. I can't even remember which cocktail I ordered, but whatever it was, it was only one, and it had a bit of influence on the lovely tip our attentive waiter received. 

I recommend and will return!
