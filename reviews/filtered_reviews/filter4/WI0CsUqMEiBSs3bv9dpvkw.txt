I like this place for the most part. I find the service good and have never had a problem with the staff. They have great chips with salsa and beans to eat before the food comes which always tide the family over while we wait. They have $.99 margaritas and they also have jumbo ones (I love the big strawberry margarita... awesome.) My go-to entree is the two tacos with rice and beans. The first time I came here I loved the service and food but the last two times I came, my food came and it wasn't hot and fresh the way I'd expect a restaurant to serve it. Then again, I suppose they do have to wait until everyone's food is ready to serve everyone all at once. A definite family favorite of our family
