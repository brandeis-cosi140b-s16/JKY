This is one of the prettiest places to dine in the Phoenix Metropolitan area.
Someone once told me that historically the place had been a brothel in the 1920's. It has kind of a Shangrila Hacienda feel to it. There is a little pond in the walled courtyard/outide dining area stocked with waterfowl, and on several occasions I have seen a wild Great Blue Heron inside!
When my parents came to visit from Massachusetts I chose a hotel destination close to this place because I think it really feels like a vacation in here!
The food is pretty good. They have this deep fried Machacca and grilled green onion thing that they serve with warm melted cheese and hot tortillas which is kind of fun for a group.
I like the Rellenos here. They have picadillo in them.
The bar area is large with a nice fireplace and well stocked with a good roasted tasting salsa and chips, as well as plenty of icewater pitchers while you sometimes have to wait for your table.
Very picturesque and great for photo-ops or possibly a wedding party or something.
Not the most incredible food on earth, but neither is it ever disappointing, and the view here at sunset is like magic.
