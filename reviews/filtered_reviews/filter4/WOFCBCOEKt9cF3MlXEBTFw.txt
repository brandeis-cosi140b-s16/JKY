We love their pomegranate guacamole...there's nothing quite like it! The only bummer is that they use craisin's in the offseason. I am picky about corn tortillas but I always order the Carne Asada tacos and get a side of their homemade tortilla chips to dip instead. Also their spicy fries and special ketchup are unique and tasty! We never leave hungry nor unsatisfied! We love this hole in the wall dive!
