Who can really complain about mexican food. Always come here whenever I want a quick bite in the random hours of the night.

The 5 rolled tacos with extra cheese 
The Carne asada fries after a nice workout
The California burrito to hit the spot
And the breakfast burrito to eat half and save for when I wake up.
Finally refreshing Jamaica to wash it all down

That's my story when it comes to robertos. The cashiers are always funny and cooks always hook it up when I ask for that extra queso! Like whopping handful of it!
