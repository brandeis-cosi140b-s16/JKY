It's like getting authentic street tacos, but in a nice clean restaurant with tables to eat on. There are so many choices of meat! But luckily the tacos are 2-biters (or 3 if you take small bites) so you can try a variety of different kinds. My favorite is the Adobado- or spicy pork. I feel like that one packed the most punch. 

My fianc√© got the carne asada fries and he wasn't too overly impressed. He didn't like that the cheese was cold and wasn't melted, so it wasn't as epic as he thought. But maybe the adobado fries would have been better with the spicy meat. We'll have to try that out next time :)
