Nice mexican place with a very extensive menu.  Had a combo with beef tamale, taco and a burrito which was pretty good but not awesome.   The fideo soup was very very salty and the complimentary tortilla chips a bit too greasy.  Service was very attentive and friendly and we enjoyed the outdoor seating.
