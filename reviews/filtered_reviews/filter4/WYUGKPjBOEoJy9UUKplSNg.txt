As far as TexMex establishments in Pittsburgh go this one is probably on tops.  I appreciate that they have a significant craft beer line up which goes far beyond the window dressing list a lot of places that try to carry craft beer put out.  Today I am drinking Founder's Kentucky Breakfast Stout... It doesn't get much better than that... But wait it does... Happy hour from 4:30 to 6:30 all draft beer is half off!!! Yatzee!

Other drink options include an extensive list of margaritas and some nice cocktails as well.  Wine list is limited but acceptable.  Big Azz margaritas (22 oz) are seven bucks from 10 till midnight every night.

The food here is good and meets expectations as far as texmex goes.  I've tried the fajitas and a few of the burritos and have always been satisfied though never blown away.

The ambiance is definitely modern, trendy, and more fashionable than your average Shadyside joint, Although, in a non-upscale, unpretentious sort of way.  There is very limited outdoor seating, but garage doors at front do open up to let fresh air in.
