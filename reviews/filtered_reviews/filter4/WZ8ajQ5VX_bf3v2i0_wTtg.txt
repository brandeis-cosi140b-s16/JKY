Oh tortas, I didn't know what you were but I'm glad I finally decided to try you. I always get the Arizona. How can you go wrong with an egg on top of breaded beef, with a handful of other delicious ingredients thrown in? I don't think I would venture out to eat anything but their tortas. 

The service is pretty prompt. I never had an empty glass, or an empty chip bowl. Speaking of chips, they are pretty good. A little saltier than I'm used to, but still good enough to have an empty bowl by the time the food comes. The salsa could be better... I don't know how to explain the salsa other than really bland. It's not always this way, but this visit was definitely a miss. 

I also like their Strawberry milkshake. It's served in a large goblet looking cup, for almost $5 the price is just right. I could just have that as a meal. Check out their desserts and large drink selection (fresh fruit drinks). 

Come eat some tortas! It is also good enough to be on food network (Man Vs Food - even though I dislike this show they advertise it, and Diners, drive ins and dives).
