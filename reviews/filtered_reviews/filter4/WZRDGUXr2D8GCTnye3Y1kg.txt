Los Favoritos is one of mis favoritos.

It's not gourmet, it doesn't pretend to be, and for that you must love it. It's cheap, fast Mexican food. In some of the best tortillas I've ever had anywhere. I'd buy the tortillas and eat them warm all by themselves.

For me, Los Favs is a breakfast haunt. They make a killer breakfast burrito with your choice of chorizo, ham, sausage, bacon, or some combination thereof. Add to that scrambled eggs, potatoes, cheddar cheese, and I'm pretty sure butter. It will clog your arteries and shave years off your life, but dammit, it's a hell of a breakfast.

Pro Tip: It's half of Chandler's breakfast haunt, too, so come prepared to stand around for a while in the mornings.  They crank out the burritos in turbo, but they've only got two (usually one) registers and so many employees.

They're also open late if you've got an evening craving for some Mexican.
