Move over Tacos El Gordo, hello Taco Y Taco!  Hands down the best tacos I've ever had.  I want to say they're authentic, but I'm a white-boy from NYC so I have no clue what authentic tacos are like.  However, I hear that many of the items on the list are quite authentic.  

The meats are all of top quality and juicy.  I love the sauce and beans bar.  The only item I wish I could have tried is the corn.  I'm not sure how I feel about mayo on corn, so I was a little apprehensive.  

The only negative that made me not give it five stars was the ordering process.  I was quite confused as to whether or not you order at one window and just move down the line or if you had to get behind each individual line for the different meat sections.  I want to eat my food hot and not have to stand three long lines.  In fact everyone seemed quit confused.  I had my two friends stand in each line so we can have our tacos hot and not have them go cold by waiting in each line.
