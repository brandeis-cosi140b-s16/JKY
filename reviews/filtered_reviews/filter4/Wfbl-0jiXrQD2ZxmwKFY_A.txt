Very casual family owned restaurant. Friendly staff and good food. Nothing here had ever knocked my socks off but the food is consistently good.  The shrimp platters are my favorite. For about $10 you get a scrumptious plate of food. I particularly like the baked shrimp dish with melted cheeses and green sauce. Delicious!
