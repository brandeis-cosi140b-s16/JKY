We went to Papi Chulo's for dinner and had a nice experience. The food, atmosphere, and drinks were all really good.
The waitress and bartender were both friendly and helpful.
One of the things that makes a good Mexican restaurant is that it MUST have great chips and salsa, and Papi Chulo's passes the test.
