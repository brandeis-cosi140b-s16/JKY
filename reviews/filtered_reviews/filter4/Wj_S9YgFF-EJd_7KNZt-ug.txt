This place is so cool. It is small and easy to order and take out. Of course, if you want to dine in, there is enough room, both on the patio and inside...just not for big crowds. 

They have gluten free everything and the food is delicious! I ordered a burger with a gluten free bun for myself and a regular burger for my sister. We had fries and chocolate shake as well, which complimented everything so well. 

I love finding gems like this place. Stop in if you are craving a delicious burger and fries.
