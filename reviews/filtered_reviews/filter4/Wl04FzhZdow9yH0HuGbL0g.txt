Excellent food! I knocked one star off for the surprise price and the lack of cashiers, but even that can't deter from the fact that the food here is quality and everything is made fresh. I had the carne asada tacos and it took every bit of restraint in me not to demolish these in front of onlookers as I wished. The meat was perfectly seasoned and SO tender! Each bite was as good as the next and the toppings were perfectly spread out on the taco so you weren't left with nothing but tortilla at the end, an unbalance that's so typically common with tacos. I'm no expert, it's just a pet peeve of mine. 

The tacos are only $3 BUT that does not include all of the toppings which are I think $1.50 (give or take) extra. They're not something you want to skip though because theyre fantastic! I have a mild allergy to avocado, but the guacamole was worth the inevitable tummy ache and again, everything is fresh! You can watch them build your meal from start to finish which is a comfort to anyone who was hesitant to stop by this place judging on location and looks alone. I also got the pineapple agua fresca which was tasty as well-not to sweet and would be a perfect refresher during the summer months. 

Again, only thing going against this place is the hidden fees for extras (which aren't really hidden, just not advertised correctly) and the lack of cashiers. I went around 2:30 in the afternoon expecting the lunch time rush to have come and gone but the place's popularity spoke for itself when I rolled up and saw a line at the drive-thru 12 deep. I can't imagine what it's like during the lunch or dinnertime rush, but would recommend they get another cashier, one for drive through and the other for inside, to speed up the process of getting tacos in my tummy!

I would have never visited this place if I had not stumbled upon a friend's quick tip and the stellar reviews on here. Overall a great experience and I'll be back!
