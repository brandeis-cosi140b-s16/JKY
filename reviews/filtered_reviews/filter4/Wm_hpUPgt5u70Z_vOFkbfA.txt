FOOD (taste, originality, plating):
TASTE:
The almejas al vapor are a must try.  The cheese plate is pricey for just one kind of cheese, but it came with apples, honey, sausage, prosciutto, pesto, honey cheese bread, and spicy chimichuri making it one of the most fun cheese plates i've had.

ORIGINALITY:  High.  Lots of new tastes and experiences.

PLATING:  Above average.  Not extreme, but better than average.


SERVICE (efficiency, charisma, helpfulness, menu knowledge)
Poor.
I sat a the bar, my favorite thing to do and was served by the bartender.

Charisma: Average: pleasant, but not a stand out guy.
Efficiency: Low: forgot my drinks, hard to get his attention despite slow crowd.  His work ethic was tremendous however as he kept very busy on side work.
Menu Knowledge: Poor.  Didn't know the answer to most of my questions.
Helpfulness: Low.  he did recommend the almejas which were fabulous, but when his menu knowledge was low, he didn't try to find out the answers.

ATMOSPHERE (bad, average, interesting, amazing):
average.  Booths, comfortable bar area, outside dining.
