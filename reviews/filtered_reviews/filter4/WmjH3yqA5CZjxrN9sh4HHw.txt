This place has some yummy tacos!! Lines can be long but well worth the wait! I had the al pastor and lengua tacos both were really good! The only bad thing is there isn't to much seating but people come and go quick so you won't be standing for long. If I came back to Vegas this will be my go to place! Beats the over priced and overrated restaurants off the strip any day!
