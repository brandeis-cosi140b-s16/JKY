Some of the peeps at my GF's job recommended this joint so I took my girlie to check it out. Its a quaint location but don't let the size hinder you cuz the food is delish. Super friendly staff & free refills on sum delicious drinks. Tried their tacos-they were good/ GF loved them. The burger & fry's was impressive to me. Great special sauce on the burgers & great on the fry's. As Arny says..."I'll be back!"
