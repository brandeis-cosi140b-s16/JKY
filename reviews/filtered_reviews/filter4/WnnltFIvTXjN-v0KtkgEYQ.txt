Jaburritos was very delicious and the first time I had tried Sushirritos.  

Overall, the food was delicious and getting the meal with mochi made my day.  The biggest complaint I have about the burrito though is the amount of rice in the burrito.  By the time I reached the end of the burrito, there was nothing but white rice.  Maybe this is something just to do with my selection and I will give it a try again.
