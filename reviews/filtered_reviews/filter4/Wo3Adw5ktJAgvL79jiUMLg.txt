Randomly found this place as we drove through Henderson to avoid the traffic on the 15 on the way back to San Diego from Vegas.  It was a very pleasant find.  $4 fish burritos which was the size of a petite woman's arm with nice crunchy fish and the perfect amount of fixings.  The added bonus was the spicy carrots & jalape√±os that are readily available for the taking.  Carrots were crunchy and flavorful which is a must!  Next time I go to Vegas, there will be a small part of me that would wish for bad traffic on the 15 so I can head over to Henderson!
