Wow I have been to few restaurants as interesting as this one. Mexican Asian fusion. Huh. I came with a group of 4 girls on a Thursday night. We wanted to get happy hour prices but they only serve that in the bar area and there were no seats. We shared a lot of small plates. We started with the pomegranate guac which was great, and I liked the chips it came with. They were very big round, freshly fried tortilla chips. The veggie roll was good with a big slice of avocado on top. The pho was interesting. Not my favorite, it did not resemble pho whatsoever. It tasted like warm salsa. We also got the beef tacos (bomb!) and chicken tacos, also delicious. The kimchi rice was also good. The server forgot about our rice until we almost had to leave, but we really wanted to try it so we hung around for them to finally bring it out. The service could have been better, our guy seemed a little aloof. My green tea was empty for too long, too many times. But interesting food, and beautiful, cool environment.
