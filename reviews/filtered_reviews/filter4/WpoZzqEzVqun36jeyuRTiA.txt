Came in for lunch with a friend last week & enjoyed a delicious meal! The food was prepared perfectly, the service was efficient & the server was attentive. I had a combo plate with a shredded beef enchilada with red sauce & a cheese enchilada with green sauce. My friend had the Chile Colorado. Both were outstanding! We both had the grilled veggies as our side (instead of rice & beans) and our only complaint was that there was way too much cauliflower in the veggies. Outside of that, no complaints at all! I'd recommend this place for sure!
