WOW.. I did not know this was such as PARTY. 

We had planned to eat there and arrived on a Saturday at 5pm. It was PACKED, definitely did not look like dinner was going to be a pleasant experience, and PS. I was not on that level, quite yet. We ate at Majerles (it was ok, review to follow). 

Afterwards we came back to Hefe for an after dinner drink. It was a good party. The bar was super busy, and I had one of those moments where I felt like the bartender wouldn't serve me because I was a lady. LOL. Don't you hate that, ladies? 

Anyhow, we got our drinks, and we had a few. We watched the fight on the TVs and danced, as the music was pretty GOOD! it was packed though and you had to fight through the crowds to move around. But, still it was a really fun place with good energy and if you're trying to party.. than PARTY!
