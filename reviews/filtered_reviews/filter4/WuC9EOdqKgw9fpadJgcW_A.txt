Went here today lunch time Sunday. Across the street from the AMC Theater. Small family restaurant. Wasn't too busy.  Good food and awesome service. I had a burrito and the wife had enchiladas morenas along with some horchatas (even put the left over horchata in a to-go cup yo!) . If you're hungry and in the area, it's definitely worth a try. We'll be back fo' sho'. Salud!
