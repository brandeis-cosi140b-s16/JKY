A few colleagues at work told me about this place.  After hearing about it for several months, I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  They have FREE WiFi here, which surprised me.  They also have patio seating and one of those new Coke machines that has a ton of flavors....the kind that you find in Five Guys Burgers.  I like those machines because you can get a variety of Coke Zero flavors.  I love Coke Zero, but it's damn hard to find in restaurants.

Some items I've sampled here:

Bean and Cheese Burrito, Regular $3.35

The Bean & Cheese Burrito is fantastic....easily one of the best I've ever had.  I think it's because they make it Lard-Free.  Also, the Cheese they put in the Burrito is addicting....I don't know what it is, but it's got me good.

The Al Pastor Burrito has a unique taste to it.  It's unlike any Al Pastor I've ever had.  It's a lot drier than I'm used to and it's kind of crunchy....I wonder if they grill or fry it before they put in in the Burrito?  It's definitely unique and good, but don't expect a traditional Al Pastor if you order it otherwise you might be disappointed.

The Carne Asada Burrito was just average to me.  I was expecting more from it, but it just didn't blow me away.  I might have to give it another try just to make sure, but I can't stop ordering the Bean & Cheese or Al Pastor Burritos, so I don't know if I will give it a 2nd chance....LOL

They have a variety of bottled Hot Sauce options on the table, but lack a Salsa bar....wish they had that.  The bottled Hot Sauce options are very good though.  The green stuff will kick your heiny, but is very good.
