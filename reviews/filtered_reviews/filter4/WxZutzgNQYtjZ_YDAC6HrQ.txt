Mmm this place is delicious! I love the carne asada fries that are loaded up with cheese, pico, sour cream, YUM! I worked in an authentic mexican restaurant and this is the only place that comes close to impressing my palette. They are pretty quick with getting orders out and I always enjoy my meal.
