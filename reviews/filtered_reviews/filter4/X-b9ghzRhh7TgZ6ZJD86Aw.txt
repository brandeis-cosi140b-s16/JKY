We ate at Diablo's on Saturday night, and it was great! We got a table for two right away, and drinks came quickly. Lame that you have to pay for chips and salsa, but it's worth it. Great chips and salsa! Atmosphere was fun, music was great, staff was friendly. Food was also really good! We split the steak fajitas, and it was perfect. I'll probably come here again.
