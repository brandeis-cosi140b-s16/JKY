Taco tuesdays? at a fancy place? well you had me at "taco". that's right...every tuesday, all day, is taco tuesday at Barrio Queen. and they have a requisite happy hour....3 dollar house margaritas (which are super tasty and flavorful and they don't taste like they're from a mix), and 5 dollar house wines and drafts. 

all their tacos are 2.50 on tuesdays. there are about 6 options for non-meat eaters, and about a dozen for the meat lovers. 

we got 4 each....one of the smoked salmon with mango, one of the "fungus" corn, one of the beer battered fish, and one of the cactus. my favorite was the fish, probably because it was fried. the "fungus" corn was also tasty and a close second place. the smoked salmon was my least favorite because the smokiness was very strong, but still good. 

service was wonderful...decor is wonderful. but just so you know before you go...the tacos are very, very small. they seemed even smaller than street size. still, the flavor was worth 2.50 considering a few other places have same sizes for not even a fraction of the taste.
