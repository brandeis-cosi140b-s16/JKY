One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte! Great authentic Mexican food, fun atmosphere. Even though I usually get the same thing (Enchiladas de Dennis), I have never heard anyone say they didn't enjoy their meal. The service is really prompt and the wait staff is friendly and helpful without being cheesy. Even on nights when it appears crowded, the restaurant seems to be really efficient with turning tables without rushing people in and out.
