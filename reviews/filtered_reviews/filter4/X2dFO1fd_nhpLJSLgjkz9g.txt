Have been going here on and off for over 20 years now and he i am yelping about it finally! This place is quite good. The food has always been good and the drinks. The only thing that urks me is that when something says a certain price on the menu or your chaulk board, I expect to see that same price on my bill, Not the 2-5 dollars per item added on. That's my only gripe.
