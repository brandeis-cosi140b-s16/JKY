Visited last night spur of the moment decision was able to get a sitter and was craving Mexican but wanted to try something new, so we pounded our heads together and decided to visit Blanco.

This was our first visit and for a Wednesday this place was full,we were greeted by a friendly Manager who wass helping at the desk for a bit to manage the wait, we were quoted 30-40 minutes and decided we would head to the bar to get a drink while we wait. The two girls behind the bar were very busy and could of used a third, they were having a tough time keeping up but were still friendly, however with one girl in the well getting buried that left only the one to handle the crowd and guests at the bar, with that said they were able to get my order we had a beer and a margarita and both were great... beer was cold and margarita was very good! 

We checked out the place very modern with good Latin/Hispanic music in the back ground with a cool open kitchen.After about 30 minutes our pager went off and we were escorted to our table. We were greeted promptly by our server Justin ( I believe that was his name) he was professional and curtious and had all the answers to our questions.

We had to try a cheese crisp, because that how we always do it, not my favorite but not bad...We couldn't make up our mind so we decided to do the fajita combo. Different compared to most on the presentation but the chicken and steak were both great. The chicken and steak must be prepared on a grill because they have a smokey flavor to them, possible mesquite. 

Over all glad we stopped in and will make it back soon.....
