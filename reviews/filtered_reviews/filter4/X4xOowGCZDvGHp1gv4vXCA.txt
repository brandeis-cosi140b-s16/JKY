Always a go to spot if I'm craving a hearty burrito! I recently got into the quesorito which is now hands down my top 5 burritos of all time. You have your regular chipotle burrito but instead of your average tortilla, the wonderful ingredients are wrapped around a quesadilla which just kicks your taste buds up a notch. It may be filling for everyone else but just right for me. I do also recommend the taco kit, which is pretty much two tortillas, rice beans and choice of meat with a side bag of chips and a drink! You cannot go wrong there! It is one of my girlfriends favorite things to get.
