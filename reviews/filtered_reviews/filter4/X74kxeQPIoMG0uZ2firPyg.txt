I've driven by this place quite a few times while on 7th ave and decided to give it a try today after my hike. I ordered the 'Surfer' torta and my friend had the steak and shrimp tacos. I have to say that everything was delicious.  The torta was definitely tasty. And the service was just as good. I've found a new taco spot and I'll definitely be hitting it up again soon.
