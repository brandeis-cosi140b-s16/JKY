Went to Richardson's this morning for brunch with friends.  Sat on the patio, that was nice.  We ordered the drink specials, $5 mimosas and $5 bloody Mary's. I enjoyed my Mimosa a great deal.  For brunch, I ordered the Crab Cakes Benedict that I thought was rich and delicious.  Would have loved a piece or two of fruit to help cut the richness but it's a minor complaint.  I would definitely order this again and return for Brunch.  My partner had the Adovado Benedict and that was also delicious.  The service was pleasant.  We will definitely be back.
