So many great things about America's Taco Shop.  It has become one of our favorite places in the valley.  Good food, cheap beer, great patio. 

The carne asada is really great.  All their ingredients taste fresh.  It is one of the best places in Phoenix for cheap, easy eats.  Go grab a carne asada now!
