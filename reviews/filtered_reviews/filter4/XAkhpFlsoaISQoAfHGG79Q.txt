I used to have to drive down to Guadalupe (the city not the street... well, actually, in Guadalupe, on Guadalupe, actually) for Mariscos like this, now I drive a mile or two down the street. Awesome! The wait staff is great... friendly, prompt, accommodating. I really enjoy their food and have had 3 different shrimp dishes and sampled 3 or more of the fish dishes. They are all delicious and the rice and potatoes they serve with the meals is a real treat also. 

I especially like the fact that they are knowledgeable about their ingredients and can tweak a lot of the recipes to make their dairy-free. They will use oil instead of butter on request making this an easy spot for people who don't eat dairy.
