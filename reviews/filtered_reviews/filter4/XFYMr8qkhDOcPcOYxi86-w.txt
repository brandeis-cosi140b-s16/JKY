I'm a big fan of this place. Usually come here with Tori B. as she is the only reason I venture out to Chandler. They have an excellent happy hour for drinks $2.50 margs, $4 Tres Olives and $1 off beer and wine. The food is pretty basic (and honestly priced a tad high for what it is). They have fish, shrimp, steak, pork and veggies. You can have these served up in a taco, burrito or salad. Like I said pretty basic. What really sets this place apart is the owner and the service. Every time I come in he is super friendly and always asks us to try new things he is thinking of adding to the menu. One time it was a spicy jalape√±o corn, and last time it was a honey chipotle vinaigrette.
The vinaigrette was awesome and he even gave me the recipe (no I will not share it).  If you're in Chandler and looking for a cheap happy hour in decent environment give Juan's a try. You'll be glad you did.
