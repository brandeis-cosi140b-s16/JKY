What can you say about a restaurant with over 650 reviews that hasn't been said before?  I had the Jade Red Chicken with Pork Fried Rice, the chicken was great, I ate way more of it than I should have.  I wasn't a big fan of the fried rice but that's probably a good thing because I definitely filled up on the Jade Red Chicken.  The people working were nice and the meal comes with a free Snickerdoodle cookie which is awesome.  Have a feeling this place is going to be dangerous since it's within walking distance from my house...
