I'm not ashamed to admit I've eaten my fair share of Mexican-American food. While Javier's claims to be authentic Mexican, they still serve free chips and salsa with every meal. Do not let that throw you off. First off, the salsa is MIND BLOWING. Secondly, the restaurant is still fairly classy. I came here with my boy and my parents (yes... my parents). We had a reservation and were promptly seated in a large booth near the bar.  Our waitress was a tad moody, but she gets points for knowing every detail about the entire menu.  

All of our margaritas were AMAZING. I had 2 of the jalapeno margaritas and the four of us split the queso fundido as an app. It was a bit like melted mozzarella on a plate (in a good way) and was served with warm flour tortillas for dipping. I was already fairly full, so I ordered the ceviche de camaron. It was tasty, but nothing spectacular. However, the portion was much larger than expected. A lot of the other yelpers complained about the noise level. It was loud and sort of clubby, but that's part of the experience. Javier's is smack dab in the middle of Aria's casino floor... what did you expect?
