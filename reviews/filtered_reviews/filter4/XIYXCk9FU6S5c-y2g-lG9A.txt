If you're familiar with the format of Chipotle, you'll feel right at home at Taco Taco.

Walking in, you start off with a choice of food (tacos, burritos, bowls, etc.), along with the individual ingredients like meat, beans, and salsa that go into your order. The great thing about this place is their extensive selection of meats, ranging from the familiar carne asada,  to even some vegetarian options like soyrizo.

For my first visit, I went with an al pastor bowl. Everything was fresh and tasty. Their approach to food is a lot less greasy than the typical taquerias around town, which made it so I didn't waddle out of the restaurant with deep sighs of caloric regret. This is something I really appreciate, especially when I keep an eye out for a regular lunch spot. 

All in all, staff was very welcoming, prices are reasonable and food was definitely on point. Mark Taco Taco for another great new addition to east Vegas.
