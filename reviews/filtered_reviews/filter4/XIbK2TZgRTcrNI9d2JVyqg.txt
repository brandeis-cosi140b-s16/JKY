We wanted to send off a co-worker friend on her last day with a little lunchtime mexican fiesta...Viva Zapatas baby. This is not a huge place so getting ten people at a table is a real challenge on a friday at  noon. Luckily we waited no longer that 10 minutes(approx 63% of one margarita) and were seated and served good chips and salsa immediately, The service is always friendly here but sometimes is I a bit slow- not today. usually get the roast pork torta and it was great as usual plus is served with very good steak fries. Mexican food w/ fries? Yeah, Im home.
 The margaritas were refreshing and delicious and the food seem to be enjoyed by all. Start to finish w/ 6 seperates checks(!) we were out in about 50 mins...plenty of time to drive back to work and nap the rest of the day away.
