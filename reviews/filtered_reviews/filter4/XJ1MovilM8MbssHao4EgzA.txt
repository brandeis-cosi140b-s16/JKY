I'm adding this to my list of places to eat at for lunch.  It fits in nicely with the rest of the great fare on Montford and has some really good offerings.

The food: I'm not a seafood sorta guy so I stuck with the chicken and pork tacos.  The chicken is a solid item with great tastes gong on.  The pork taco, on the other hand, knocked my socks off.  The meat itself was seasoned and cooked to perfection and worked well with both the flour and the soft corn shells.  What got me going was the pineapple mango salsa that topped this beauty, it was a beautiful complement to the meat and offered a new take on the taco.  
As far as sides go, I keep going back to the mexican street corn:  think grilled corn on the cobb with some saucy goodness.  Warning: not beard friendly but definitely tongue lovin.  
Appetizers - The chips and salsa  trio's blend includes some great tastes (my fave is the pineapple-mango..go figure) and the Guac trio also serves up nicely.  The wings pack tasty heat that doesn't dissapoint.

The atmosphere:  Stylish, fun.  Booths and tables were comfortable.  The long table at the bar with bar-height metal stools - not so much.  Avoid if you can.

The Value: Lunch special of 2 tacos + side is plenty of food at a good price (8 bux).  Dinner - you're ordering tacos and sides independently so you're probably paying more, but not outrageous.
