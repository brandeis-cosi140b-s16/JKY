Had driven by this place a few times while visiting back in Madtown, looked pretty real and was on the right side of town so had to try. Yay! Real mexican, made & served by the same, and the place full of local hispanic families. Yes, it was hot & humid (Madison in August, right?) and my togo sat for 5mins before I got my ticket. The world didn't end with a 5min wait and the food was FANTASTIC! Lingua tacos, melt in your mouth good. Carne asada burrito, best since San Diego street food.  Realize your a gabacho, gringo, and get some darn fine mexi here!
