I've got two tickets to Paradise... Valley Burger Company! Is it Shangri-la? Not quite, but the burgers sure are heavenly. The creative menu, divey ambiance, and personable management/staff, make this place a great lunch or dinner option. Especially if you've got meat on your mind.

Celebrating Jennifer [100]O's review UYE (see what I did there?), where else would we go other than a Yelp-approved burger joint. Several other fantastic Yelpers showed up to make this live-review event a momentous occasion. Well, momentous compared to your average review! 

I ordered the Burger Brulee and split a side of seasoned fries. This burger was really flavorful, with a fine mix of savory and sweet. It's loaded up with a fried egg, bacon, onion, burnt sugar and havarti cheese. The fried egg will undoubtedly break apart, mix up with the ingredients, and drip a tantalizing sauce for you to dab up with fries (pro tip). I highly recommend it! 

The restaurant, itself, isn't much to write home about, but you don't need fancy digs to grill up amazing burger creations. 

In the future, I want to come back and check out the Beach House Burger. A recent Phoenix New Times "Burger Battle" pits it up against Hopdoddy (which I love), and winning!
