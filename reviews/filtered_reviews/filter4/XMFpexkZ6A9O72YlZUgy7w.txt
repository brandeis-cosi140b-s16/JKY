This place is brand new and I was excited to give it a shot since it's right around the corner from where I work.  I ordered two full tacos (fish / shrimp / pepper) for lunch.  They were still installing the security system so they're still figuring things out, based on their website, this is their 1st and only location thus far.  The measures of good corn tortillas for me are: are they fresh and do they fall apart - and these are really good.  The fish and shrimp were fresh and tasty and the cheesy pepper was a nice touch.  The salsa bar is nicely stocked with different salsas / condiments similar to what you'd find in Mexico.  The menu is simple and reasonable - definitely worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood!
