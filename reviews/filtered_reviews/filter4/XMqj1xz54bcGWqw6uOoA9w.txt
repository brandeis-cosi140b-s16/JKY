4 1/2 stars. Came for dinner on a weeknight. I didn't have reservations but was no problem getting a table. I heart the layout and the Decor of this Javier's 

The chips & salsa were yummy and would have gone great with a margarita. Unfortunately I was on meds and had to to good. For dinner I went with the seafood entree Cabo Azul which included a shrimp taco, lobster enchilada, seafood chile relleno, beans and rice. the food was light & excellent tasting. 

Overall a great meal with stellar service and quality from the entire staff. I'm looking forward to returning and checking out that margarita!
