One of my favorite spots for lunch in Vegas! I love the atmosphere. It's festive and fun without being loud and obnoxious. Their salt air margaritas are absolutely to die for, and my friend has been re-creating them perfectly for at least a year. It takes some work to make the "air," but it's totally worth it! One of my favorite drinks anywhere.

The concept of Mexican-Asian fusion seemed a little bizarre to me at first, but there is plenty of separation on the menu if you are not an adventurous eaters. It's fun to mix and match Mexican and Asian small plates and go between.

I have been here 3 or 4 times, and have tried a variety of dishes. Almost every dish is a small plate or appetizer, and my friends and I always get a variety of options to share. The guacamole is outstanding, and there are plenty of gluten free options (including the chips), which pleased my gluten free friends. When Pigs Fly is one of my favorite appetizers. The steamed buns are super filling, but delicious.

I would recommend trying at least one of the sui mai options, and if you are indecisive, try the combination! The Dan Dan Mian noodles are delicious, but definitely on the heavy side. The twenty-vegetable fried rice is also a go-to, especially if you are feeling the need to eat more vegetables during your time in Vegas!

This is a perfect spot to try with friends and explore different menu items, including the must-have salt air margaritas.
