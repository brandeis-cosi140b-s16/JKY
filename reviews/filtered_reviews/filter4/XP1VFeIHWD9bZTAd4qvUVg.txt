Wow, is this place great!
I was a little apprehensive when my boyfriend showed me his favorite Mexican joint in Madison--it definately looks like a dive.  But he loves food and so do I, plus I read all of the previous reviews, and gave it a shot.
Walking in was a bit... icky? It is not the cleanest or nicest place-at all, but we were greeted by smiling faces.  Space is limited here and we sat at the "bar" which is really where the cooking is going on, which is nice because you can watch them prepare your food.

I got 2 vegetarian tacos and a potato chalupa. Oh, and a tangerine Jarritos!  Oh my goodness, it was all so great and SO cheap.  The tacos are $1.75 each and chalupa $2.50 (I think).  My boyfriend got chicken enchiladas which he had never had and loved as well
Plus, the chips and salsa werer really good (minus the fact that they were replenished by a gloveless boy :/).

If you can get over the clean factor, this place is amazing.  4 stars b/c of the no glove thing, but the food is super good and very fast.  I will definately come here if I want fast Mexican instead of taco bell lol.  

AND my bf said they have outdoor seating in the summer! Yay!
