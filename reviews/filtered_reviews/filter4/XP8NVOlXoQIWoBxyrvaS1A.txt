Beautifully crafted dishes w fresh, sustainable products. I had the Pork en Mole - tender pork in mild dark mole. It came with black re fried beans, guacamole, and something like a cheese quesadilla that had taken a bath in ranchera sauce.  The husband enjoyed Ensenada Fish Tacos. Again very fresh ingredients. I also enjoyed a fresh watermelon margarita made with jalape√±o infused tequila - sweet, tangy, spicy goodness. Service was very friendly and attentive. Want to try their brunch, which I've read is the best in Las Vegas.
