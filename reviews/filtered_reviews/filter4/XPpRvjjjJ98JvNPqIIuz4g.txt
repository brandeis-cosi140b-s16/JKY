I read about The Stand in the AZ Republic, and I was intrigued by their limited menu.  There is a double burger, and 3 kinds of street tacos: short rib, chicken, and veggie.  They also have fries, chips & salsa, and a variety of beverages...including milk shakes.  I am a sucker for the milk shake, and when I read that they have BOTH chocolate chile and salted dulce de leche shakes, I KNEW I had to try this place.

The very next day, I went with a couple of co-workers.  The first thing I noticed about the place was the big, bright blue BIKE RACK out front.  There is a drive thru, and the place gets busy for lunch.  The service was fast and friendly, but another coworker who went today on my recommendation said she waited a long time in the drive through line.

We found our burgers, fries, shakes and lemonades to be superior, and we all plan to go back to The Stand again.  I hope to be on my bike next time!
