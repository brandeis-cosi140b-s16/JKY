A definite 'Gotta try at least once' I was pleased with the eccentric artistic decor. ^Very cozy,^ good waitstaff, ^very refreshing "Sandia drink" 
^live guitar player some evenings ^Good Sangria wine, ^Great desserts, -small menu and a bit more than I would expect to pay however, I keep coming back. I recommend any one of the steak dishes and go for an evening dinner when lights are dim and candles are lit.
