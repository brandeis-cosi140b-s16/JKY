I've been to Joyride a few times now and Upward has done it again. They have built a little Monopoly in my hood and I couldn't be happier. Both times I have been here I rode my bike, they have ample bike parking and a big patio.

The bar is gorgeous with the stained glass vases and the concept of the restaurant is very laid back and open. I have a feeling I will be spending a lot of time here when I can pull myself away from the Windsor. 

I also love that they honor the Upward tradition of $5 till $5 on pitchers and wine. 

The tacos are street style and with so many street style tacos shop these days it is hard to find something phenomenal on the menu. That being said though everything I tried was very good. The carne, the nachos and the salsa will all keep me coming back for more. 

I'd love to see them do brunch!
