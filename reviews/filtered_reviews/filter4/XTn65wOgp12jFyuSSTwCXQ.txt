I personally really like Salty's ... during the week or during the day on the weekends. I love the chips and salsa and the chicken tacos, the margaritas are great and it is a nice place to go sit outside during a Saturday afternoon with friends. They allow my pup to come with us, always check to make sure he has enough water and the manager came over to visit him several times the first time we brought him ... then brought him the cutest little shirt which was left over from a rescue dog fundraiser they hosted. Anyone who loves rescue dogs is ok with me. During the day, the crowd is pretty laid back. On weekend nights, the crowd seems to be a little bit rowdy, but there are plenty of other places in the neighborhood to visit ... so we have just decided to designate it as the perfect Saturday afternoon spot with the pup and friends. I have always had good service here and think that the decor is fun. If you are looking for a Scottsdale type place to hang out, you're probably in the wrong neighborhood to begin with ... and if you are upset that it is dirty ... we do live in the middle of the desert.  If you are looking for a fun, casual outdoor , spot  I'd definitely recommend it. I'd recommend the beer, the strawberry margarita, the chicken tacos and plenty of chips and salsa!
