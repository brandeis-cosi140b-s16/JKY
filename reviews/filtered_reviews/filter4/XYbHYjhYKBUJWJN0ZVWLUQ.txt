This place is legit!  It's solid Mexican fare at reasonable prices and made quickly.

Tuesdays are taco tuesdays apparently so the carnita, pollo asada and pastor tacos are only a dollar a piece.  They were all solid, but my favorite was probably the steak - not a special but reasonably priced and probably the best I've ever had.

We also had the red chile burrito which was very meaty.  It was very good, but a bit too much after a while.  

I definitely want to try the bombito one day and the street tacos were awesome.  Parking is kind of hard in that complex, they seem a bit territorial with the spaces along the stores..  The bathrooms were much nicer than I thought they would be so don't avoid going in there like I was doing at first!  :P
