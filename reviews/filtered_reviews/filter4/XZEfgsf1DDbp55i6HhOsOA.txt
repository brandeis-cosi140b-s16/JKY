Looking down the row of dining options in Terminal 4, Blanco looked like our best choice. We were able to secure a table immediately and our waitress was quick to take our order. It wasn't a problem that we only wanted to order chips and salsa and to split a burrito. 

The chips and salsa came almost immediately and were everything that they should be - homemade, fresh with a nice zippy salsa. The burrito had a generous portion of chicken with a really nice flavor. The rice tasted like it was made with a lot of butter, good or bad depending how much you like butter. 

We are used to overpriced and less than delicious airport food so Blanco was an unexpected and delightful surprise.
