This rating is for the bar only. I'm giving it four stars because honestly it just doesn't blow my mind, but it's a solid place for beers and guacamole. 

They typically have happy hour which I always miss. I know it's a decent happy hour too. However, when ever I come I only get a Pacifico draft and guacamole. 

The guac is outstanding! Made to order, which I love. The even add pineapples to their guac which is a nice twist. The beer is great and draft is a beer deal than the bottle. Same price and you get a few more ounces. I think the beers are overpriced, but it's a restaurant on the Las Vegas strip. 

The bartender with a beard (I feel bad even describing someone like that, but I completely forget his name) usually serves us and always does a solid job as well!
