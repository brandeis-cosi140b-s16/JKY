Wow, it's really been 7 years since I first reviewed Someburros! I'm still a big fan of the rod burro, but it's such a big meal that I usually only get it if I'm starving or sharing it with someone. Some of my current favorites are the cheese crisps with guacamole or with green chile, the veggie burro, the chicken and bean burro, and the tacos are still quite good. The salsa is still nicely hot and spicy, and the addition of carne asada, fish, and breakfast adds to their menu variety. While I appreciate that they're branching out with new foods, the fish tacos that I tried when they first introduced them to the menu were really not very appealing. They were overcooked, bland, and super oily. Hopefully they've perfected their recipe since then!

The outdoors seating is nice when the weather is not too hot, and they don't mind if you bring your dog with you to sit outside. 

Sure it's not gourmet dining. But when you're hungry, craving a fast, filling meal for a reasonable price, Someburros is a good choice!
