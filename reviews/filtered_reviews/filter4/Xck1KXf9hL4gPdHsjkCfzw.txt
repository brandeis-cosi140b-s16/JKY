We arrived at 6:30 and was told 25-30 minutes so we ventured to the bar, where chips and salsa were brought to us immediately. The chips were light, warm, and fresh with a great salsa, and the margarita's were awesome. After about 40 minutes I checked with the hostess and we were the next table to be called. However, the wait time was over one hour and fourth-five minutes, the place was packed! We are the Paco's tacos which were great & a combination of a shrimp and chicken taco. The Paco's tacos were awesome, and the chicken was good, however, I'd pass on the shrimp next time. The sides, cole slaw, rice and beans were all good. We will definitely be back!
