My husband and I made reservations (highly recommended) for late dinner after a comedy show.  I loved the ambiance of the underground eatery and meeting place.  The crescent-shaped booth that we were escorted towards could easily fit 5 average sized people comfortably.  Loved the plush seating and high back booth design that is reminiscent of a retro steakhouse restaurant.  Our table had a comfortably wbiew of the firplace.  We ordered the calamari appetizer, prime rib sliders and the Carne Adovada. The food was good for the most part.  Calamari had a great aioli sauce on the side.  Sliders had good thick (possibly handmade) horseradish. The sauce on the carne adovada was a bit harsh like it was on the bottom on a large pot and has been on the heat for sometime. Maybe needed something to "cut " the severe chilli flavor.  The Jalisco Mule also was a treat and enjoyed it being served in a chilled copper mug!  The one other thing that kept me from giving a 5 star review is the music down there was a bit loud for folks to have a regular audible conversation.  Our neighbors at the table next to us were conversing in French. So the French and the blaring  music made the quiet of the late-night air welcoming as we exited the restaurant.
