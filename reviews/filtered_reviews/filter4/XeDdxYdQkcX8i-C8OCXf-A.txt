I would have given TQLA 5 stars but what stopped me short was the noise.  This is a great place.  Food was excellent, drinks were right on (I had a Lemon Drop Martini and it was delightful) and our server was very nice.  I had made reservations for 6 but had 3 unexpected guests arrive and they accommodated us with no fuss at all.  

Now, even though we had 9 at our table we were seated very close and comfortable and really should have been able to enjoy each others conversations but since the music was so loud all patrons were talking loud and therefore we couldn't hear anyone that wasn't sitting right next to us.  This is/was my only complaint.  No reason for the music to be so loud during dinner hour.
