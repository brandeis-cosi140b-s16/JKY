Alright, let's get one thing straight, when one thinks of "REAL" mexican food, it isn't the boring and bland stuff you find at chipotle and baja fresh. The reason why Mexicans are so fat is because really Mexican food is fat, greasy and definitely full of lard (I'm Mexican so I can say that!)

That being said, this place TOTALLY DELIVERS! The food was very authentic, tasty and flavorful. I actually went two times this weekend. First of all, the chips and salsa are AMAZING. They give you two kinds of salsa, mild and hot. I only wish that they gave you bowls to put them in, instead of putting it on a flat plate.  We also ordered a side of guacamole, which I thought was very good. 

Some of the other reviews have said you can't make modifications to your order, but that is not true. I asked for no onions in my enchiladas and they were happy to do that. The tamale was good and so what my shredded beef taco. Having that big side of guacamole definitely spices up the tacos!

They also have lunch specials until 4pm everyday!! They also have a decent happy hour (I've heard) and their beers are pretty cheap. I always love a place that has Dos Equis on draft.
