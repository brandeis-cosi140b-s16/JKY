FABulous! 
Met a girlfriend for lunch here yesterday. Great location.  Parking garage right next door. 
The chips served before the meal were okay. Not great. Bean dip pretty good. Salsa quite good.

I ordered their beef tacos, it was REALLY good! The meat was tender and cooked perfectly. I don't recall what type of pepper was on it, but the waitress suggested that I get them without it and with the pico sauce on the side (because I'm not a fan of hot spicey). She made the right call, the tacos were perfect without it. I tried the pico sauce and again she was right... even it was too hot spicey for me. I pulled a few of the tomato chunks out to add a nice kick of flavor.

I'll be back. Just won't waste my calories on the chips on the front end!
