We find ourselves here with every Vegas visit but this trip we were a little turned off by the pricing. The $12 -16 drinks & $12-20 entrees are starting to add up.  It's still Mexican food albeit kicked up a notch. Lobster tacos were skimpy, fish tacos grilled were a favorite and the quality of the Margaritas don't disappoint.  Ahi tacos were a nice surprise with 4 on the plate. Just a little bummed that prices are inevitably climbing.
