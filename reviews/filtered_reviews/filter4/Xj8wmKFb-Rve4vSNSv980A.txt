Whenever I drag friends along to return to my Arizona roots, I take them to Elmer's.

The strips are out of this world. If you haven't had them, imagine chips topped with shredded (not melted) cheeses. Plop on some hot sauce (conveniently offered in ketchup bottles for maximum squeezage) for a heavenly combo.

I highly recommend the mini chimichangas with a huge soda.

Oh, and park around the back.
