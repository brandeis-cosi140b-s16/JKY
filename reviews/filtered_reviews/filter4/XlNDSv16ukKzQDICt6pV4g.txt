I had doubts about the authenticity of the food at first,  being that this is a Mexican place at the Venitian hotel. And though I cant say the dishes were 100% traditional, everything my party tried was delicious. Im not sure if the twist they put on their dishes is just to make them unique or if they are fused with a different culture, all I know is that the flavors blended well and left me wanting to go back! I ordered the Chiapaneco citrus glazed salmon, which was marinated in a delicious tamarind sauce, topped with mandarins and served with a sweet potato hash. Honestly,  I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed it! My boyfriend ordered the Mazatin seared ahi with quinoa salad and that was also really good. The ahi was seared with this really tasty chile sauce... best seared tuna ive ever had! He also ordered the shrimp calamari cocktail, which I expected to be a bland American version, but was actually very close to the authentic Mexican style... also very good. My sister and her girlfriend tried the chicken enchiladas and a Tarascan chicken soup, which I did not try but they loved. And last but not least, my absolute favorite thing was the sangria de rojo, which is a blend of sangria and margarita. Now I want to go back to try every other drink on the menu!
**The service and the view were great too!**
