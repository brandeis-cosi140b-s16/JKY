Great location, although parking can be a hassle. Awesome view even if you're not close to the windows.  It's a big open restaurant that gets loud on a busy night, but I'm okay with laughing and singing at a restaurant.  Live music mariachi band. Bartender making awesome house margaritas and other specialty drinks. Waiters are knowledgable about the menu and always have great suggestions. Each waiter has helpers (Nacho is the best!) that refill drinks and help serve. This means I'm always taken care of. 
The food is great, big portions, flavorful and lots to choose from. You start off with a bowl of refried  beans, salsa and chips as soon as you sit down. They are quick to refill these items! My house margarita on the rocks was perfect balance of tequila and sour. Most meals come with a side of refried beans, rice and salad. Best dishes are Camerones Abuelito (bacon wrapped shrimp) and my favorite Camerones Tia Esther , a blend of spices and cream. Order the freshly made at the table guacamole!
