This was a recommendation from the Concierge at the Mirage - excellent choice!

A very very nice restaurant! Service was strong, friendly, and attentive. Our party of six had a variety of dishes and we loved them all. The ambience is romantic, although a bit loud. We also tried a variety of the specialty cocktails, which were also delicious. I had a Tamarindo Margarito that was just amazing. Unless you hate Mexican cuisine, this is a guaranteed hit.
