Wanted to try a local place and heard good things. The place is modest with a friendly staff. For the love of jesus, if you can't take heat, do not eat here! The posole was amazing and you NEED to try the homemade tortillas! A bit different than the posole I'm used to but this is a new mexican style restaurant so it's a bit off from the mexican food I'm used to from chicago. Overall a good experience and will definitely come again!!
