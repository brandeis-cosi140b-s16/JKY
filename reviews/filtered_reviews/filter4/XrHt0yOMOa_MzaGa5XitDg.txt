Been here a handful of times whenever we are on that side of town.  My kids love it and the food is good, if anything toooo much food, lol.  But there is no complaining since the prices are always reasonable.  

The margaritas are good, the drinks in general are good and very reasonably priced.  The staff is always nice, helpful, etc.  And the food comes out very quickly.  All in all, it is a win.
