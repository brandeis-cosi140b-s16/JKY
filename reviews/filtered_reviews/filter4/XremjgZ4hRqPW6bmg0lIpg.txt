Being a native Phoenician, I have a junkie like addiction to mexican food.  I find Someburros to be quite satisfying.  It is not a _bertos clone, so don't go expecting carne asada like you're used to.  It has a more authentic menu, that isn't all that authentic, but more so than _bertos.  The Pollo Fundido is indeed delectable and decadent.  The three way burro is scrumptious and may I suggest a cheese crisp with green chiles, which is my personal fav.  

It's a bit more pricey than _bertos, but well worth it.

Call in your order and they have a pick up window.  You can't beat convenience.
