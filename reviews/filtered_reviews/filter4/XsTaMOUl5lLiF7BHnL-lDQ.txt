The food at Cafe Rio is some of my very favorite. I love Chipotle too, but the reason why I would say I like Cafe Rio more is because of their green ranch, YUM! That ranch is something else. I smother my burritos in it and always choose it for my salad dressing - a gift from the gods. 

Another thing, I'm not entirely sure if Chipotle has Daily Specials or not, but if they do, Cafe Rio does a better job of advertising them. I love Cafe Rio's Daily Specials because they come with a free drink! Good deal, considering their menu is pretty pricy (the reason I withheld one star).

I am most particularly appreciative of this location because this Cafe Rio is right across the street from UNLV, so I never have to go far whenever I crave their food, which is ALWAYS. Haha. Big plus.

ALSO! Their ice!  For those of you who love icy cold drinks like me, I'm sure you are also fond of their ice. All other food establishments need to follow suit.
