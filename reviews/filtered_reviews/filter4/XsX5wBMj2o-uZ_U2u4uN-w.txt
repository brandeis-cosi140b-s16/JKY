First meal in the city and lived up to its billing. Had the taco platter with: carnitas & al pastor pork plus barbacoa beef. Fresh onions & cilantro, lime and a great spicy green salsa. Throw in some guacamole and a Modelo beer - it was a perfect start to the trip.

Plus Carlos was super friendly and shared bits of different meats for tasting. Great service.
