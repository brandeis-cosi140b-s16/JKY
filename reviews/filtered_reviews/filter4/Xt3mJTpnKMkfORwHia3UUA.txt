Would be a solid 5 star if they improved their chips and especially their salsa. The entrees I have tried here were all very good. I ordered from the special Hatch Chile menu both times. The chicken enchiladas with the queso sauce were outstanding. Good service. Bar tables have a better ambiance than the dining room.
