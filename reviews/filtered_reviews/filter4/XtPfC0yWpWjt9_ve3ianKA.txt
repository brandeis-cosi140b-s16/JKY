A simple, clean taco place that you can take family and friends to.  The food is fine and the staff is nice.
The reviewer (M.S) that said the music is too loud is sadly mistaken; this is NOT a loud place at all.  There is an outdoor patio and it's entertaining to watch the people not know what number is on their ticket..it's used to pick up your food dummy.
