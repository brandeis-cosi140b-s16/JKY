Great atmosphere and really good food. Went for happy hour (1/2 priced apps and not sure of the drink specials but the margs were full price and we didn't care for any of them). Great crab cakes, wonderful mango chicken salad with jicama and excellent ceviche but the table side guacamole was standard fare, nothing special. Great bar scene and huge dining room and outdoor patio, will definitely return and just drink wine.
