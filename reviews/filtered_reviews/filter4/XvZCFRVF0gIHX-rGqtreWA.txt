Kinda surprised this place only has a 3.5 average rating. 

I really like Vida. I have been here several times over the last year and always had a good experience. The margaritas were outstanding and the portions were pretty sizable (I couldn't finish my meal!). And oh, the ceviche cocktail is heavenly (I included that in one of my tips). I get a fair amount of really good Mexican food in Chicago and Vida sizes up pretty well.
