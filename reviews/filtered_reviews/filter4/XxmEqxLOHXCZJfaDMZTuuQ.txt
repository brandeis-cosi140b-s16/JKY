The Adobado ribs make me shit fire for three days, but I keep going back. Granted, the staff is a little pretentious, the margaritas are grossly overpriced, the wait sucks, the place is noisy, and there's only one spice level (hot as holy shit), but it's a true cultural experience, which is more than I can say for the rest of Phoenix, homogeneous craphole that it has become... 

Also, this is NOT Tex-Mex, so quit saying that. Tex-Mex is from Texas, and it usually refers to beef enchiladas covered in chili and Velveeta, not insanely spicy New Mexico cuisine, which is how you would describe Los Dos Molinos.
