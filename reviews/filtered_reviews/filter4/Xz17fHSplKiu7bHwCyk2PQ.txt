I was here again for their Margarita Brunch...I still have to say - how can this be legal?!?!?

It's great - the buffet itself is actually pretty good...my favorite items were the Chimichangas and Green Chile Pork Stew.  The Huevos Rancheros were also very good.  There are plenty of other options as well as an Omelet Station.

The margaritas here are very good and very strong...be careful!

They have a very friendly staff as well.
