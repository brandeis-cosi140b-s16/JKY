I love this place because they make aguas frescas or licuados from just about any kind of fruit you can think of. They are not made from powdered mixes - they cut up the fruit right there and blend it with water, sugar and ice. I love the agua de sandia (watermelon), melon (canteloupe) and mango.  The drinks taste just like the fruit. Just beware, they are big and you can get full just from drinking them while you are waiting for your food.  You can ask for your drink to come in a to-go cup if you want to take it with you even if you eat there. 

The food is great! I love the tortas, quesadillas and tacos. I haven't found anywhere else that comes close to the taste and selection yet. 

You can call ahead and then pickup your order also.

I love salsa and bachata music and they often play this in the restaurant. They sell tickets to local cumbia concerts sometimes too.
This is a great place!

Note: They were formerly called Tortas La Presa. I had gone to some of the other Torta La Presa locations and did not find the same food or drink selection and didn't know why. When I visited the 7th St location we asked and were told that due to a issue with the name and other places using the same name but being different, they had to change it.
