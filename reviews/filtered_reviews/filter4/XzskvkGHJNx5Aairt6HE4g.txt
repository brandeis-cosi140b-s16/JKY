Me and my wife were in town celebrating our Anniversary. We get a craving for good authentic Mexican food outside of the strip. Thanks to Yelp, we run into this place. We arrived pretty late (30 minutes before closing time). Luckily the waiter warmly greeted us, and did not make us feel as if we had to leave for arriving so late.

The chips and salsa are very good and fresh. They also provide you with a side of beans to enjoy with the aforementioned chips and salsa. I ordered a wet burrito and it was huge! Did not dissapoint. Extremely good!! Plus the waiter was always attentive and provided great service , despite it being past closing time.

So if your in town and need some really good mexican food.....this is the place.
