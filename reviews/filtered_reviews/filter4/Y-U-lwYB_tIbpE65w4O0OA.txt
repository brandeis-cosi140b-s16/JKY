This is a very clean and well appointed Mexican restaurant in Mesa, Az.  We enjoyed chips, salsa, margaritas, appetizers and our entrees.

I felt the service, atmosphere, drinks and appetizers outperformed the entrees.  However it was a great dinner and good experience.   The prices were reasonable.  I'd suggest the restaurant use larger shrimp in their fajitas.  I personally do not like the smaller ones.
