PLEASE go and try them!!  First of all the place is local which I love.  Then the burgers are delicious!  And let me tell you the buns are fab.  Get the house made chips instead of the fries (better to me).    I esp love the smoked mozzarella with bacon and jalapeno and ranch sauce...get it with everything (picked onions, cucumber, etc)  YUMMY!
