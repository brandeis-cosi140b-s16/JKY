Due to my other half's hatred towards Mexican food, I very rarely get to indulge in it's deliciousness. However, one night I paid a visit to Tacos El Gordo after my girlfriend's soccer game. I didn't know what to expect, but had heard rave reviews about the place from everyone and was terribly excited to finally try it for myself. The wait wasn't as bad as I had thought it'd be. My friend had ordered me two tacos--one carne asada and one al pastor. I'm the type of person who has the save the best for last, this also applies to the way I eat my food. I took one bite of the al pastor taco and it was delicious. I took one bite of the carne asada and it was even more delicious. Needless to say, I finished off with the carne asada, but gobbled both up quicker than you can take a breath. 

Based on my first visit alone, Tacos El Gordo trumps Roberto's and is my new favorite taco spot in Vegas!
