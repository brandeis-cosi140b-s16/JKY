Had an awesome dinner here before checking out the Michael Jackson One show. 

Highly recommend their margaritas and Baja ceviche as an appetizer.

I had the skirt steak which was cooked perfectly medium as I had ordered and the tres leches cake was a tasty dessert. 

I would definitely come back again as the food and service was awesome!
