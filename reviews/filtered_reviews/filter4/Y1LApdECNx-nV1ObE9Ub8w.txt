Technically this place is a chain, so I don't think I'm supposed to like it. The Cantina is beautifully decorated and I wish they would use their larger patios during good weather, but so far they have a ton of outdoor space that they aren't getting use out of.  They have a small patio at the front of the restaurant that is lacking in ambience.
The menu is the more complex New Mexican-style of food - which makes me happy when done well. I have tried as many things as I can on the menu and have always had a great meal - the Tacos Cascabel being my favorite. Their tableside guacamole is extremely good, and they will ask how hot/what ingredients you want or don't want. Let's not forget the margaritas! Surprise!! This place has probably the best house margarita in Phoenix....it's fresh and not lacking with decent tequila. If you plan on having a 2nd one, make sure you have a designated driver. And give their desserts a try. The apple pie/ice cream that comes to your table flaming in brandy is to kill a diet for!
