I have to admit I didn't think I was going to get an as good meal as we did. We ended up going because we got a restaurant.com gift certificate and thought we'd try a new place.  We've always passed it on Camelback and many time went to Oreganos next door, but never stopped.  I am glad we went last week.

The menu is good sized and the prices were reasonable.  We got the chicken stuffed with peppers and cheese and the Salmon and Spinach enchiladas.  Both entrees were excellent.  I was especially surprised by the enchiladas....you don't usually see salmon and spinach in an enchilada...and executed very well.   We got the guacamole and lobster quesadilla for an app.  The quesadilla was "ok", but the guacamole was very good.

The atmosphere is nice and cozy.  The bar and patio areas are where you will want to site...they have a more authentic feel and the vibe is great.  The dinning room is so-so.

The service was superior and our waiter was way cool and made great recommendations.  He was attentive and knowledgable about the food. He was a rock star in terms of service.

Overall, I would say give this place a spin....it was a great meal.  Why we never stopped there before, I'll never know....
