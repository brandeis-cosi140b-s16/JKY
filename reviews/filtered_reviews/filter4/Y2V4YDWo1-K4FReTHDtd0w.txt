So I had the pollo asada fries, Mexican street corn, chips and guacamole and the pineapple mango agua fresca. Everything was great but my only complaint was with the fries. They were just a tad bit over cooked so they felt more hard and crunchy. My boyfriend got the carne asada burrito and I'm so sure next time I will be getting that. Staff was very friendly and helpful.
