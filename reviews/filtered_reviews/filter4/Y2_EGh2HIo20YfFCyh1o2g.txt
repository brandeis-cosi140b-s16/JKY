You wouldn't expect it judging by the exterior/interior design and the corny iridescent spanish colors, but the flavors were for the most part authentic and tasty.

I ordered the Chile Relleno and taco combo which came with rice and beans.  The plate was more than enough for one person.  The rice was light and flavorful -- even the beans which I don't typically eat were good.

My friend ordered the carne asada burrito and it just didn't compare to the combo.  Definitely go with the combos here.
