Although we've eaten here several times over the past five years, we hadn't visited for awhile. I was a bit afraid to return after reading recent Yelp reviews. However, my husband and I were pleasantly pleased with the friendly and very efficient service. The restaurant was very busy with several special events, but we still received our food in about 15 minutes. Our waitress was genuinely friendly. The food was hot and fresh. I like non-fussy (OK, maybe bordering on Gringo?) Mexican food. I don't like too much cheese or too many onions or really hot sauces, so Aunt Chilada's was definitely my style. Portions were quite generous for the higher prices, so we came away full and satisfied with the experience.
