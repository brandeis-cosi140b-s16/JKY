I wish we had a closer Valle Luna to our home, but this one is worth the drive.

I bought a gift certificate from restaurant.com and took my 3 kids to this restaurant for a night out with mommy. I hadn't been there in years.

The waiter was prompt at keeping my massive amounts of iced tea flowing, and was very nice. 

I ordered the pollo fundido and it was fabulous. Whatever seasoning they use on the chicken was so tasty. It was probably the best pollo fundido I've ever had. Chips and salsa and my kids' food was great as well. 

I've been eating here for over 10 yrs, and I never really enjoyed it all that much until this experience. I will definitely be back with another gift certificate :)
