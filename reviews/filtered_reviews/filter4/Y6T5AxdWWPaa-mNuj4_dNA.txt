This place exceeded my expectations. I've known about Yayo for the last couple years, and had seen a show or two there, but never had I eaten there. This changed about 3 weeks ago, when a friend of mine who had recently moved from Las Vegas came back for a visit and wanted to hit it up while she was in town. 

I've read the reviews about Yayo having some amazing Veg friendly tacos. Little did i know that the ones I had would blow my mind. I had the UNLV lunch special ($5.00 with four tacos,two sides and a drink !?!) I had the only veggie tacos on the special menu, but thoroughly enjoyed them. I had a side of black beans and chips. The corn tortillas were perfect, not greasy at all. The veggies were cooked very well, and the sauce was a nice topping to the tacos. 

I always knew this place was good for a show, but now I have one more great, cheap lunch spot. I also want to come back as they had a pretty decent beer selection with a variety of micros and imports that I've not seen many places.
