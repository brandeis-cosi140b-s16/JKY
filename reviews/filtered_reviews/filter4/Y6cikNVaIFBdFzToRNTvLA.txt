Always a treat to get back to Barrio. Looks like they've painted some fun murals on the walls in the back parking lot. Feels a little less like we'll get mugged back there heh. Barrio is our favorite Mexican restaurant in the city. You'll probably read a lot of people giving it bad ratings because they didn't get rice and beans with their entree, chips and salsa before hand, and saying ridiculous things like how much better La Parilla Suiza is lol. So if you go and you aren't familiar with authentic southern mexican cuisine, just understand that you aren't going to Macayos.

Started off last night with the Queso Fundido. It's the only reason my review isn't getting 5 stars. (well, that and what I consider lackluster but competent service) First time I've ever had anything there that I didn't think was just amazing. It really fell flat and didn't have a lot of flavor. Other appetizers we've had there were out of this world so this one was extra disappointing. My wife and I both hand margaritas which were great. They have pretty much every type of tequila known to man there also.

For the entrees, I had the pork tacos. As I was eating them I told my wife that they were the best tacos I've ever had in my entire life. She had one of the quesadillas and loved it also.

Highly recommend Barrio. Like I said, it's the best Mexican in the city imo, and the tableside quac there is the best you'll ever have.
