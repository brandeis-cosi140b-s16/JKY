Los Dos has some of the best tortillas ever - they're homemade, thick, soft, and just perfect.  The food is great and very flavorful, and the couple of times I've been here everything I've had has been good.  They also have quite a few daily specials in addition to what's on the main menu, so make sure you check those out.  The chips and salsa that they serve might be too spicy for some people, but in my experience, they're more spicy than most of the dishes, so don't worry if you think they're too hot.  The margaritas at Los Dos are also excellent and they're huge.

The atmosphere is also really cool and there's usually good music playing.  Give this place a try!
