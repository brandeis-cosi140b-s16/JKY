I visited Comedor Guadalajara for the first time last night. This is a gigantic restaurant located in South Phoenix. 

The Good: The menu is extensive. The salsa they bring with your chips is hot and delicious. Ordered the "three meat plate" (for two) and was bombarded by a metal skillet (with it's own built in burner) heaped with a mountain of steak, chicken, pork, jalapenos, and onions. It was a meal for 4! The flavors were exquisite.

The Bad: The decor is bland, and the lights are brighter than the sun.

The Ugly: Nothing at all was ugly about the place. The staff and patrons were all very friendly. The bathroom was clean. The place felt safe outside even after dark (they have a security guard posted at the door).
