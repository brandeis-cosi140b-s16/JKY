My grandparents wanted something mexican for dinner and they did not let them down!
We arrived on a Saturday around 6:30 definitely busy, the wait was 30-45 min. We put our names on the list and waited outside as the lobby is not large enough to hold many. We counted i believe 4 seats... with elderly this is hard to stand that long. 
We soon realized that they did not come outside to call any names, thus having to stand in an overcrowded lobby to wait for our names to be called. Luckily a younger couple gave up the seats to my grandparents. 
The wait was not too bad. Once seated we could tell they were definitely busy. Chips and salsa were at the table before we were even greeted by our server. AWESOME!
The server was definitely overwhelmed but seemed to handle it pretty well. Food took a little while to get but the chips and salsa definitely held you over. 
The chicken and beef unfortunately weren't very flavorful like we had hoped. Even tho the menu described the chicken to have spices it tasted boiled and plain. :(

However the rest of the meal was delicious and it made the grandparents happy to try somewhere else that was for the most part authentic.
In the end we will be back to try it out again, maybe next time reservations?? or not on a Saturday!
