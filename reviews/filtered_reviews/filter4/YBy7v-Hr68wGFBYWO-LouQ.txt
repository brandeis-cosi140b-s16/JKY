We stopped here because we could not find the restaurant we were looking for. So, yes, it was an accident, but we were greeted very friendly and they had great specials to eat a good meal for pretty cheap. The food is not amazing, so I will tell you that it your looking for the meal or your life, it's not here. However, it was good, we were not disappointed and we both enjoyed our meals, drinks and resting our tired feet. The prices were also great, we were enjoying Vegas on a budget and this fit in well. My husband meal was a drink/corona special, so it worked great for him! I had a cheapie margarita and was happy with it and my meal.
We would go back. Easy to find, right on the strip next to the M&M store, good specials, friendly waiters and overall a good experience!
