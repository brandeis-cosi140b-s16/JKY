I am from Albuquerque and am probably the pickiest Mexican food eater ever, because I am simply spoiled by having grown up with great New Mexican food. There are only a few places that meet the standards here, and this is one of them. It is hidden and only word of mouth, but so worth it. I have only been once, but want to go back to try everything. The Pork Green Chile is sooooo gooood. Seriously, it satisfied my New Mexican food craving. If I can't be there, I have this place to tie me over. I would recommend it to anyone craving real New Mexican food and spice. The staff was also so nice and helpful.
