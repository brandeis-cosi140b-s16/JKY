Saw it on D-cubed, and I'm in town with my daughter for a soccer tournament.  We like Mexican food (we're from Sacramento), so we decided to stop by.   Place was very uncrowded for a Friday lunch; only a few tables occupied.   Server was really nice  - my daughter likes her tacos pretty plain, and he took her order really nicely.   

We each ordered carne asada tacos, and I ordered a carnitas taco, and she ordered the pulled pork.   The carne asada didn't really stand out  - the mole was understated.   The carnitas was fantastic, as well as the pulled pork.   One think I noticed in previous reviews was that the texture of the meat was mushy - that was not an issue with our meal.   In fact, I thought the texture was a highlight.

Price is right, food is good, service is good.  We'll be back!
