Very rarely can you find good, truly authentic Mexican/Central American food. Three Amigos definitely makes the mark. They take the whole day to let their beans and rice cook slowly. Their ingredients are crazy fresh (and tasty!), the presentation is colorful and appetizing.

So far, for the QC, this is my fav Mexican spot. Now they just have to get more vegan options and I'll be crazy happy.
