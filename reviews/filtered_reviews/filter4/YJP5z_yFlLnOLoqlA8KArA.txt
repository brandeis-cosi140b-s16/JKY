I think Sylvia's has the best Mexican food in town. If you love chimichangas you have to try the pollo rico it rivals the baja chimi at Macayo's. The chips and salsa here is great. I like how they offer you both corn and flour tortilla chips. Sylvia's is now a full service restaurant and the service sucks but I always come back for more because the food is so good. Just don't order the fish tacos!
