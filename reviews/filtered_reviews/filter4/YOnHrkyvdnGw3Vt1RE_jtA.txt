The patio here cannot be beat. It is a perfect date spot. They have small lights all over and you feel like you are no where near Chandler, AZ. 
The live music they have is always good. The prices are a tad high but that is the cost of great ambiance I guess. I had the chicken enchiladas and they were very good. You can tell that the sauces are homemade and the black beans were spot on. 
This is my favorite spot in Downtown Chandler no question.
