When choosing a mexican restaurant I always look for authenticity and as soon as you walk into this place you can smell the wood burning fire grill. The salsas were really good and authentic. The tacos (both hard and soft looked delicious. I got the asada quesadilla and it was very good. The staff is really friendly and outgoing. The guy at the register was very nice and asking everybody how they liked their food. I will defiantly go back to try the rest of their items.
