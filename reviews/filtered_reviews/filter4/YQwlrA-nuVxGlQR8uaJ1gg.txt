While I'm sure Fausto's has many other great things on their menu I keep coming back here for one thing...and one thing only. Carne Asada super nachos. While others in my family ask me to pick up Taco Bell stuff down the street,(It's a Saturday tradition around here) I'll swing by Fausto's and order my nachos first. Then when I get home I set their Nacho Bell Grande on the table, then I pull out my Super Nachos which lands on the table with a satisfying thud. Then I open the container and let others bask in the glory of piled high nachos with carne asada steak, piled with guacamole and salsa and cheese and it all has an aroma that quickly overpowers the smell coming from any of the Taco Bell stuff on the table.... 

4 Strong Stars for one menu item? Yeah, it's that good. 

Parking can be a zoo, service is fast and usually friendly too. Definitely worth checking out.
