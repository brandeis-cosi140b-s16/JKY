I organized a no-host dinner here in June 2014.  They were very accommodating over the phone, taking my reservation for 25 and not hesitating when I called a few days later increasing it to 35.  What they didn't tell me was that they wouldn't have all of the tables ready at our reservation time.  We had one large table in the middle of a room but it wasn't big enough for all of our guests.  People had to stand around and wait until diners finished and their tables/booths became available.  It was a casual group so people took it in stride, but it was a bit stressful for me as the organizer until everyone had a seat.

The wait staff was very efficient and made sure they had a drink and dinner order for every guest.  This was more difficult than you would imagine as we had people up and about, visiting with people at other tables.  I heard nothing but compliments about all of the entrees ordered and I know that my mole was quite delicious.

One more comment about the restaurant -- it is quite loud.  Between all of the conversations and the wandering mariachi band, you have to raise your voice to have a conversation.  This is not good or bad -- the place is quite festive.  But if you are looking for something more subdued then this isn't the place for you.

Overall we really enjoyed this restaurant and I would not hesitate to recommend it to people going to visit Vegas.
