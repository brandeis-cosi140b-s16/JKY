This is a really fun place on the ground floor of the Monte Carlo Casino.  I went there for happy hour with some friends while we were in town for a conference.  They have a really fun happy hour - there is a huge wheel hanging from the bar, and every 30 minutes they spin the wheel to determine the next happy hour special.  Some examples are $5 Patron shots, $5 Fireball shots, $6 margaritas, and $3 bottled beer.  We ordered some nachos to share - the portion is HUGE, and they were quite good - with tons of fresh ingredients.  The restaurant is nice and open, with a large bar.  All of the employees we encountered were very nice and friendly, especially our bartender Andy.  I can't speak to the rest of the menu, but just based on the nachos we had, and the fun time we had at the bar, I would go back to Diablo's and try more items on their menu.
