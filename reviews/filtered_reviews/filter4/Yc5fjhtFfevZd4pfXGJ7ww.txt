Let me start off by saying I've been here several times and reason being? Food Network of course...so I got the BBQ Mahi Tacos as always and they were delicious! I love the crunchy slaw with the tender Mahi Mahi and the white cilantro sauce. 

Service was ok (that's why I took off a star). Our waitress was flustered even though it wasn't that busy. She forgot to bring more chips & salsa after being asked an excessive three (3) times. Not to mention the station to get the chips & salsa was right beside our table; So we repeatedly saw her walk past it but we still didn't get it until asking the 4th time. She also took a while to bring our beers and we could see the bar from where we were sitting.  Also, the hostess @ the door had a mild "stank-a**" demeanor that I didn't appreciate. O_o
