Intimate setting that compliments an excellent brunch. Specialty juices & drinks were tempting.  Guacamole & chips were excellent with a nice presentation and flavorful salsa options.  Enchiladas with mole were fantastic. Beau enjoyed enchiladas with green chili sauce.  All eats taste extremely fresh. Portions realistic. Service was very crisp and polite.

Although lighting is dark, surfaces appeared very clean and sparkling.
