Where Caly meets Texas and covers it in homemade quac.
The guacamole is to die for. Chunky yet smooth, tangy yet salty, flavorful and satisfying. The tacos are perfect like street tacos should be.
Being from Texas I'm a tough critic on quake as well as salsa...both made the cut and beg me to return with friends.
