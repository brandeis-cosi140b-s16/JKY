If you ever head to Border Grill on Superbowl Sunday watch out for that large table of guys who just stepped out of the hurt locker.   There will be about 10 of us drinking tequila and eating bowls of great tortilla soup to get our legs back under us so we can watch the game.... The staff is cool, and they just laugh at our sorry asses when we show up looking like death warmed over.

Border Gril has a nice location in Mandalay Bay near the pool(s).   Its split over 2 levels and has a great shaded patio on the 2nd floor.

The food is excellent for vegas, the kitchen turns out a fine assortment of regional mexican fare that is a step up from most the food you get in Sin City, but stick to the basics, some of their fancier dishes reaveal the limits of their ingredients.  Did I mention they serve tequila to jackasses?
