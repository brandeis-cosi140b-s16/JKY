Really enjoyed my experience at Paco's Tacos last night. 

Had a group of 10-12 people we were planning on, was able to call in and make a reservation with no problem, even though some of our party wasn't going to be there until after our reservation time.

Waiter and helpers were fantastic.  Did a great job explaining the different drinks and different menu items that were new to us.

The appetizers are pretty good, especially the unholy guacamole.  The bottlecaps/pickle chips appetizer was ok, however I was disappointed by the amount of fried jalapenos we got, they were hard to find and the dish was mostly fried pickles.

Entrees were great.  I got the Paco's Taco (brisket) and BBQ Shrimp.  Others were raving about the Gringo taco, Enchiladas, Skirt steak and Chicken.  No one was unhappy with their food.

Drinks were inventive, including the mango infused vodka drink with ginger beer.  You also can't beat a 20 oz. draft of Shiner for $5, at least not at a restaurant.

Overall was a great experience.
