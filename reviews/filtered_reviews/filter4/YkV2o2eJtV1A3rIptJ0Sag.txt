Oh my goodness, oh my goodness!  This place is fabulous!  This location has had a lot of restaurants occupy it, but this Mexican restaurant is to die for!  I was the only one there.... They had a few specials on the board and I saw fish tacos (3) for $5.99.  I ordered those and a mexican coke.  I sat down at one of the nice booths (restaurant easily seats 30+) and the nice waitress brought out a generous portion of chips and four salsas.  There was a mild, spicy, green and another medium/mild.  The chips were warm and crunchy.  Almost finished the basket!  The fish tacos came out soon after and they were great!  The fish was lightly breaded and fried.... I wish they were grilled, but I didn't ask.... There was a generous mound of onions, cilantro, cabbage and a mayonaise based drizzle on top!  They were great!  I also got a mexican coke.... It came out warm, but drinking warm coke reminds me of my grandparents...they used to serve us warm coke so it was nostalgic for me.... I bet it would bother a lot of other people.... But anyways, the bill came out to about $8.60.   Not bad!   I would say that this place would give Maize a run for its money.... They have a lot more seating and the food is just as good if not better.  Too bad it's waaay out in Urbana...They're also open for breakfast....  I will definitely be back to try some other things!!  I hope they don't fall suit to the prior restaurants at this location....that would be a terrible loss.
