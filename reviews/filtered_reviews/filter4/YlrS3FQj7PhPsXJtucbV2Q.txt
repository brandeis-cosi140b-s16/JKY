After reading Laura R's review I decided that I have to stop by this restaurant that I pass to work everyday, also thanks to Jason as well. 
  It was great to see some rare items on the menu. The service was great and the food was prepared to perfection.  
 I do see similar patterns, my friend and I were the only ones in the restaurant. at 6:30 on a Monday how sad.  A place like this needs to get more exposure, hopefully it can keep a live during slow times. 

The atmosphere is is cozy and the service staff was helpful and bilingual.   I must return for the dessert because I passed it up the first time.
