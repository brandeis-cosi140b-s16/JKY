If you are looking for authentic Mexican food you have come to the right place!  This establishment is straight from Mexico and you can taste it in the food, deeeelicious!  This place isn't really too vegetarian friendly, but they are willing to serve up a plate of cactus or make mini-quesadillas if you ask.  We went with family and they ordered all sorts of tacos and loved every single item hey got!  If you go in a group have someone scout out a table while others wait in line, oh and expect to wait.  With food this good, this cheap, on the strip you should really expect it and be prepared ;)
