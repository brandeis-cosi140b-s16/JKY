We went here with a HUGE group (14 people) and this place was perfect.

We pre-arranged a private room with a pre fix menu and all you can drink which was perfect. The room was the perfect size, and they gave us a ton of food and were really good about taking drink orders (and giving us buckets of beer). Even better, the food was really good!

While it definitely was not cheap, the service was excellent and the food is pretty good.
