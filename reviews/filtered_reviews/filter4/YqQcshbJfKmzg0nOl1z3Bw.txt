This place is awesome! Everything tasted fresh. If I have visitors from out of town and they ask for good Mexican food, I will take them here. I am still eating and I couldn't wait to write the review. My only complaint is that they need a new bar manager. The drinks were not very good. Margaritas were not great. Bloody Mary's were just okay. Overall, really good. Boom! Finally found a good Mexican spot.
