A friend suggested Tacos El Gordo when I mentioned Las Vegas so I came on yelp to check out the reviews. I read that the wait was crazy long. We were here the first week of May and not sure if this is a slow month for Vegas in general but we walked right into Tacos El Gordo and there wasn't a line- both times we went. It was great! I was expecting at least a 20 min wait. I love lengua in general so of course that's what I ordered and it was delicious. My husband ordered carne Asada and he loved it. We came back again for lunch the next day. I would eat here everyday if I could. Don't forget the horchata drink for just $1.50!
