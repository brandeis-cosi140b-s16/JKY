I want to live off the salt air margarita. It's delicious and not to be missed. All Chicagoans are extremely spoiled with great Mexican food so the tacos here were not my favorite, however, the steamed buns and guac were delicious. Our server Terry was also worth a 5 star rating. Las Vegas houses some of the best service in the country and most are all-stars but he really made us love our time there. I would definitely recommend this place if you need somewhere quick to stop before grabbing a later dinner or show in or near the Cosmo.
