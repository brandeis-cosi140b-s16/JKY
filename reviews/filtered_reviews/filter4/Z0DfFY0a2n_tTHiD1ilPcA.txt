We were planning a sushi trip after martial arts training but one person in our party didnt like sushi so we decided to have Mexican. I do not normally eat much mexican food and I had no heard of Ricardo's before as i've only been in Vegas a few years. 

The service was great, we had a really cool waiter who was on the ball the whole time. The chips were good and came with 3 dips (salsa, bean, green dip) to snack on before the meal.  I have not been eating alot of red meat in general lately but Carne Asada is a go to that usually is great no matter where you go.  I think it was probably my fault, I wanted just some carne asada tacos but instead got a whole carne asada steak huge meal that was hard to finish.  It wasnt bad but not what i was expecting so i was a bit disappointed.  Everyone else loved their dishes. It is a pretty high quality Mexican restaurant. I think it might be a bit expensive but I did not get to see the tab as it was picked up by another member of our group. 

I would go back but I would be more careful ordering next time to make sure I actually got what i wanted.
