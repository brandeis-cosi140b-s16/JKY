We were excited about this place and it didn't disappoint.  We moved 2 months ago and have been here 4 times already!  The house margarita is fantastic.  They have a lot of great options for margaritas but we just can't bring ourselves to try something different.  They offer 2 types of salsa for dipping, one is red and served warm the other green. I've never had warm salsa but it's delicious!  The food is always good.  Make sure to check out the test menu, it is at the back of the menu.  It contains items they are considering adding the menu permanently and it contains some gems you don't want to miss.
