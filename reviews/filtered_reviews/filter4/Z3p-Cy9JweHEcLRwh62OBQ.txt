Stained glass windows and brightly colored walls with walnut trim greet you upon entering the main room/bar of this neighborhood hot spot.  The various rooms of this cottage style restaurant keep it intimate, but the bustle of activity in the main room keep a lively spirit moving thru out.  Family owned and run, these people greet you like you're friends.  From Thursday to Saturday evenings you hear the festive sound of the featured musicians of the week, with of course a Latin beat. Great food and something for everyone with fresh salads, entrees with spice; and cream sauces, seafood, pork chops - you name it.  Word to the sweet tooths' - do not pass up dessert.  The flan in this place is the best I've ever had.  Moderately priced.
