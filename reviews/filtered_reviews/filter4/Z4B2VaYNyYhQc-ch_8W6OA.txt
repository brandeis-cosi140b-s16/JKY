We ate here when staying at the Flamingo, bc it's nearby and has patio seating. The tacos and chips and guacamole were all yummy. The prices for the portions were a bit high for home, but not too bad considering its Vegas. We were there early, too early for the mechanical bull, but I saw it on my way to the restroom. The place is really big, and I plan on going back at night to see what it's all about and to ride that bull!!
