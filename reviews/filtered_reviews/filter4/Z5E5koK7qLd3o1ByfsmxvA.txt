Joyride is right around the corner of my house and I will definitely be back again! The staff was friendly as as soon as my roommate and I walked in the door and the bartenders were really helpful in guiding us through their menu. I have seen a better beer selection but the Short Rib Quesadilla was phenomenal!!
