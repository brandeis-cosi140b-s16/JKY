Well, after finding a buy one get one coupon I decided to give Cafe Rio a try.
Home made tortillas made right in front of you and a similar line to Chipotle.
I got the salad, my son the burrito both with shredded chicken.
AWESOME.....salad was great, my son loved the burrito. Cafe Rio just moved up to his #2 favorite Mexican spot. Food was good, and I have one more coupon left, so I'll be stopping by again this week before it expires!  
Thumbs up.....worth the stop. My bill was $9.15 for both with the coupon. YEAH!!
