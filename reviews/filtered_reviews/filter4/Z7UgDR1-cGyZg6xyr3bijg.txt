I live here in vegas and I love this place.  For a strip resteraunt it is cheap and has a great and fun atmosphere, one of your best casual dinning places on the strip.  The food is great and taste hand made, there is a lady usually making tortillas from scratch when you walk in. The chili rubbed skirt steak is dynamite and all the tacos are good too.  The chips and salsa also rock.  If this place wasn't on the strip I would eat here more.  Do expect a long wait but what do you expect.

Better than T&T at the Luxor.
