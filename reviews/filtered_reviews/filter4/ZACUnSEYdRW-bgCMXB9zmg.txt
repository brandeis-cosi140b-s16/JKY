Back in the 70's Phoenix had a dirth of strip mall Mexican places.  Last Pinata was the busiest of them all with 2 he waits not uncommon.  They are still a great place to go for family run Mexican food.  The machaca is outstanding but I do not believe their story of inventing the chimichanga.  Agave margaritas are good too.
