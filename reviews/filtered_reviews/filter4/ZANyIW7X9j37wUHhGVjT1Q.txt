Waking late after the gluttony of Carnevino the previous evening breakfast on Sunday would feature not only the culinary stylings of Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger but also new friend and fellow blogger/local gourmand Clint at Border Grill's all-you-can-eat Mexican brunch.  Having visited the original Santa Monica location with family many years ago and coming away impressed by the food but less so by the service the style of the Mandalay Bay location was decidedly different with a large, open floorplan including al fresco dining and typically professional Las Vegas Strip service delivering selections two at a time as we progressed through 90% of the menu, most of it exemplary in quality considering the $35 price.  Featuring bottomless coffee and beginning with fresh fruit and empanadas before progressing through plates both sweet and savory utilizing organic proteins and produce plus house-made jams, jellies, sauces, and creams highlights of the menu for myself included the fluffy biscuits surrounding peanut butter, jelly, bacon, jalapenos and a fried egg as well as the quesadilla and excellent shrimp and grits but all-in-all it would also be foolish to overlook the quality of the pork belly atop the crispy waffle, clever churro tots, or creamy French toast either - the only problem with these being that I had a real estate appointment and the combination of limited time and so many other choices prevented the ordering of a second round.
