We were there for their Cinco De Mayo event.
Music - the band wasn't very talented, but they played awesome songs!
Food - we had their tacos, which were $3 each - coming from San Diego, the tacos at Agave weren't the best considering the price, but they weren't bad either.
Drink - holy crap. the margaritas were seriously strong. totally worth $5!

What amazed me the most was the operation.  They sold one dollar "tickets" at either end of the venue which you can pay with either cash or cards, AND they had an ATM machine right there, which completely eliminated the "barrier of entry" for people.  It was so easy to get drinks/food, hassle free and quick.  Lesson here for businesses - make it easy for people to spend money!!

Over all, it was a very enjoyable experience.
