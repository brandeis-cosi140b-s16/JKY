Pretty good place to grab a quick lunch in Scottsdale Quarter.  The atmosphere was cool and relaxing, the service was nice and the food was good and super quick.  The veggie tacos were really good and the chips and salsa weren't bad either.  Hopefully this place will last longer than the previous restaurant.
