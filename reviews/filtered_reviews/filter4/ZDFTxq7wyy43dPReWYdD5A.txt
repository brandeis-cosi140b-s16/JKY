Long day at work? Family coming to town? Need some drinks to put a break up out of your mind? Head to Z Tejas and order a Chambord margarita stat!!! The refreshing, frozen treats are so potent that the restaurant and bar will limit you to three. And while you may think you're not feeling more than a case of brain freeze after your first one, you're sure to feel the effect soon enough. 

If you're with a big group be sure to grab a booth or a patio seat at this cool Scottsdale Fashion Square nightspot. The patio is a fun place to people watch and take in the fancy rides that people valet. If you're inside with a couple of friends, grab a seat at the bar and say hello to Jerrod Sands. He's one of the best bartenders in Scottsdale. But don't hate on him when he cuts you off after that third Chambord margarita. You're probably slurring by now and he has your best interest in mind after all.
