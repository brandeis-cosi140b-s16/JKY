Feeling alone is scary, but dining alone could be one of the most frightening thing a man can do, and doing it in vegas? Dont even go there!

After some sporadic gambling with various outcome, i decided to stop here for some food. Im not young, but i was alone so i decided to get one of their open bar seats. One thing i noticed when dining alone is that service often is ridiculously good. No matter if you eat by the bar or not, they seem to care for you more and want to give you all the attention you need.

The sizzling fajitas combo was generous and tasty as it should and they have quite a few interesting cocktails as well. This place is located right off the casino floor so if you dont want the uptempo you should go somewhere else. Service was speedy and precise and they seem to have a great coordination in between each other. .

The name of the restaurant is actually YÖLOS which quite randomly involves the Swedish letter "Ö", but in this case i will not make any scene, just go with the flow.

Dont be afraid dining alone at this place in this crazy city, you probably end up having a great dinner, with excellent service while finding some new friends.
