The search is over, I have found taco heaven. I sampled a chicken, asada, and pork street taco. The pork was a little sweet and smokey, the asada was well seasoned and smoky and the chicken too was a winner, just not as a flavorful. My husband let me taste the Bombero burrito, OMG, was that Mexican barbecue sauce on the burrito? The dining experience was well worth the 30 minute drive. I would sample everything on the menu. Thanks for the suggestion Bill B.
