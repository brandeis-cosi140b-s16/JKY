Yep still a fan. Mostly of the Grand Canyon Margaritas, they soothe away the pains of the day.  They have what I have now seen to be a rotating list of Happy Hour food options which are usually not bad and range from $2-$6. I usually fill up on chips and salsa. I have not changed my mind on the seasoning they use on the chips (sweet...spicy...meeh) I find myself picking through the basket to avoid the highly seasoned chips. The salsa is good but the large tomato chunks make it tough to get on a chip, or when you do it is hard to get from that point to your mouth without it falling off (usually on my chest or lap). I have yet to order from the regular/full menu. Maybe one day!
