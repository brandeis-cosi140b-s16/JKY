I love love love this place. I love the chips and salsa. I love the sauces they bring and I can't seem to get enough! The patron margaritas are super good. The staff seems pleasant and happy and I think that they are doing a great job. I am there at least once a month for the last few years and I have not had a bad experience. Good Job!!
