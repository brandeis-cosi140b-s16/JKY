Surprisingly good Mexican food for a restaurant that appears to be staffed by no Mexicans. They've made a lot of improvements since they first opened and the guacamole has gone from flat-tasting to really good. The portions are generous, the staff is friendly, and the Mojitos are excellent. The one downside is that it doesn't take much for the place to become crowded and very, very noisy.
