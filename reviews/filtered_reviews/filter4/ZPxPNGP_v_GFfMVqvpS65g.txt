Salsa and Guacamole are both delicious, hands down the best part!  I had the spinach enchiladas and they were great.  Note for vegetarians they do use lard in their refried beans so skip those.  My husband raved about his chicken fajita chimichanga, said it was fantastic.  The margaritas are not worth the price tag, but they are alright.  Service is ok, not quick but not bad, drinks stayed refilled, food came out perfectly hot and check was out when asked.  These days those things seem rare in the far west valley!
