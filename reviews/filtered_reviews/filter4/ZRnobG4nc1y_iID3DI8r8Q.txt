Happy hour is where it's at. Their margaritas are pretty damn awesome, super fresh with only 3 ingredients. None of that sugary neon green mix to be found here, only fresh lime juice and 100% blanco agave tequila. Even not on HH $6.50 is a really good price. Guacamole is also good, perfect texture, nice portion and limey. Salsas are fresh and flavorful, the pico tastes like it was just picked from the garden. While the crowd isn't for me the price and freshness draws you in. I like how the wash stations are outside of the bathrooms, very hip but approachable design going on here.
