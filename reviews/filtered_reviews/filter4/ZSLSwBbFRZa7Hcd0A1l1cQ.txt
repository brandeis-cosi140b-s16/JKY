What a great place to take a break from the crowds of the strip! You can duck away into the basement and enjoy some quality Mexican food (and fantastic margaritas) while escaping the masses. We had a large group of thirsty bikers but still had a hard time finishing our pitchers - they are huge! In the end, of course, we prevailed, but it was a challenge! The food is also very good. Being a big taco fan, I ordered the Mini Tacos, forgoing the rice and beans so I could try both the Shrimp and the Steak. They were great! I also tried a bite of the Lengua out of curiosity. I wasn't a fan but I think that I am just not a fan of cow tongue.
