Stopped by for a quick lunch by myself.  I was pleasantly greeted at the entrance and immediately seated at a nice window booth.  The restaurant is fairly spacious, clean and there seemed to be ample wait staff.  I was given complimentary chips and salsa and my order taken promptly.  I ordered the Cubana Torta with ham, pork sirloin, avocado, onions and peppers.  They offer quite a large number of tortas in a couple of sizes.  Plus Burros, Tacos, Quesadillas and some Seafood dishes.  The pork sirloin was well seasoned and sliced thin so it was very tender and complimented the ham.  Overall, the sandwich was tasty and filling.  The torta came with ruffles potato chips right out of the bag which seemed kind of odd.  Some type of "Mexico City" side dish would seem to be more appropriate.  Overall, very satisfied with the service and food.  I'll be back soon to try another Mexican sandwich.
