How couldl you not love this place?  It is awesome!  Now is it fancy or healthy or super nice elegant...no!  But it is not supose to be...it is suppose to be a casual place with awesomely delicious comfort Chinese and Mexican food!  This food will add to your waste line so if you do not want to do that then I would keep this place on your guilty pleasure list!  I wish I could eat whatever I want all the time but I cannot!  My favorite is the red jade chicken in a quesadilla with black beans and jerk chicken fried rice!  UMMMMMMM...can you say yummy???  I have been here several times and everytime its still greasy and good!  I introduced this place to my coworkers and they love it too!  I get the same thing everytime because its that good!!!  Trust me you will be in some heaven when you try it!   Plus you get a cookie with each combo!  The snickerdoodle one is great!
