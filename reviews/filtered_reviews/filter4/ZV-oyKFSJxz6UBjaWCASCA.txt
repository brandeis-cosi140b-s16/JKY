I've been coming to Los Dos for many years.  I usually go to the Mesa location since that is closest to where I live.  The food is great.  I love the red salsa but it has taken me a long time to graduating from being able to barely dip my chip into it to being able to actually scoop up a tiny bit.  It is very hot and I often end up with heartburn, solely from this salsa since i never get heartburn otherwise.  I always get the enchilada dinner with the egg on top.  It is the best.  i've never had anything else so I can't recommend other items but I do know someone who swears by the machaca chimichanga. 

I will agree with other people here who state that the service can be poor.  It is too bad that so many people say that same thing.  I would think that the owners would want to change that since they must have heard of this by now!  The last time my husband and I ate here, a few weeks ago, we felt like we were intruding by just being there.  The server seemed distracted and too busy to attend to us at all.  I feel like the server is more of an "order taker" and that's it.  You are lucky if you ever see the server again since someone eles may bring your food and the check.  

But, I'm sure we will visit again...in a few months....to enjoy our favorite enchilada dinner once more.
