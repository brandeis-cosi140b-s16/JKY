Really good Tex Mex! They have happy hour nacho bar from 4-7pm. Everything seems really fresh! I loved the jalape√±o ranch dipping sauce with my chips! I had the Chika Chika boom boom which is a house favorite and I was very pleased! My boss had the Baja shrimp tacos! They came individually wrapped in aluminum foil, which was neat because it keeps them warm! If you want authentic tortilla soup this is the place to go!
