Absolutely loved it.  My daughter and I happened upon this place and what a pleasant surprise.  There is plenty of parking for a city location.  The decor and ambience is a perfect 10.  It's casual and interesting at the same time.

The chips are good but the salsa, while being high quality, wasn't my favorite.  The enchiladas, on the other hand, were perfect.  The sauce tasted completely homemade and delicious.  I had the red and green sauces and they couldn't have been better.  My daughter wanted her burrito done a particular way and they nailed it without any complaint.  This is just a high quality Mexican restaurant with nice people as servers and an interesting atmosphere.

Furthermore, the coke was perfect.  You know how some coke tastes more like Cherry Coke or there isn't enough fizz or there is too much fizz.  Best coke I have ever had was here.  This place is a winner!
