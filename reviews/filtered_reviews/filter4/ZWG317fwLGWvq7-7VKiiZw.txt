Visiting Cave Creek. El Encanto was recommended to us by a local. Great ambience. While we were told the wait would be 45 mins, we're were seated in less than 15 mins. Our seating with a view of the duck pond provided for a delightful experience. Staff was friendly and attentive. Tequila Lime Shrimp and Pollo Con Fundido were both very good. Excellent Fried Ice Cream. I'm a fan.
