Is it a giant sushi roll or are handrolls just miniature versions of a jaburrito? We might never know the answer to this chicken or the egg question, but this new fusion joint is spot on. The marinade of Asian cuisine neatly wrapped inside a roll is not a new idea. Fusion burritos have been around for nearly a decade with the advent of Korean burrito food trucks. Sushirrito was the original sushi burrito concept to open in San Francisco. I've tried them all, and in the past, I've found this concept to be a poor substitute for actual sushi because the pieces of tuna or salmon were cut in such a way that they were too chewy and stringy. It was, in essence, a larger, shittier version of actual sushi. 

Fast forward to the soft opening of Jaburritos last week. This place takes a step in the right direction. Most of the menu items are affordable starting at $5.25 and up. Not only do they have raw fish, they also add a crunchy option to the mix with the offering of shrimp tempura and soft shell crab. I settled on the popular Redondo, which is filled with three different kinds of fish: salmon, yellowtail, and ahi tuna mixed with tobiko, guacamole, red onion, cilantro, wasabi mayo, and cream cheese wrapped in seaweed (soy paper also available). Each and every bite was delicious. Although I wish I could have appreciated the flavor of the sauce more, the ratio of fish to rice was great. The addition of the different self-serve salsas went wonderfully with each bite. However, for nearly double the price of some of the other fishes, I might have just ordered two separate tuna and yellowtail jaburritos in retrospect. All in all, the fish quality was great and I will definitely be coming back to try some of the other things including the jachos.
