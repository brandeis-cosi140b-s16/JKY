So first of all, let me say that this place is amazing! The food is absolutely spectacular and fresh! The tortillas are made to order which makes the tacos that much better. The reason that I am giving it only 4 stars though is because I think that they should be open past 2 closing at 2 just doesn't work with my work schedule. I would say stay open to 3 would work much better.
