Beans, beans, beans. Seriously the best beans I have had from someone other than my family.

My carniverous friends rave about the beans here so I was excited to try it for lunch. I ordered the large bean burrito. Duh. 

It was everything they described it and more. Tortilla was grilled perfectly and the tasty beans oozed profusely from the burrito. The salsa it came with was okay but kind of bland. But it wasn't really needed. The burrito tastes like the ones my Tio used to make at the restaurant he owned in Santa Ana when I was a little girl. Definitely took me back.

Oh, and the beans are VEGETARIAN. Yes, it is possible to make tasty, authentic refried beans that are not swimming in pig fat!!! Please take note other Mexican restaurants. You can get a whole new clientele by eliminating lard. After tasting America's beans there is no excuse not to make yummy beans without lard.

Last time I went I also ordered their street corn. It was heavenly. Cheesy, buttery goodness with a hint of lime. The hot sauce it comes with is great, but beware, it is a creeper.

Employees are great, and always seem happy to see you.

Why wouldn't you come here? :)
