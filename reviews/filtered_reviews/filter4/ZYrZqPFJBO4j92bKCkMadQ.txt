Lemme just tell yall something right de phug now: I'M IN LUST WITH THIS PLACE! If the prices weren't a bit steep then this feeling would transition into love but hey, it's Vegas & the food makes me warm on my inside parts so my motto for the place? Treat yaself dont cheat yaself!

I don't care where I'm staying in Vegas, I come here to eat once every visit. There's parking all around for free in surrounding hotels so suck it up, put some comfy shoes on and make your way to this spot located on Luxor's second level.

I'm from Baltimore so pay very close attention to the next few words: GET THE CRAB TOSTADAS! They do so much justice to my favorite crustacean on this appetizer, I'm trying not salivate over my space bar right now.  They've boosted up their menu selections but the fajitas are still a fave of mines. I also love how they give a variety in salsas with your chips!

The bar has a VERY nice variety. I mean they were one of the first bars I saw to have Castries Peanut Rum Creme liquer (never had it? get with it) and this was before I even saw it in liquor stores on the East coast (it's bottled in Bowie, Maryland). Again, the price of their full bar will get to ya pockets a little bit but make the best of it by getting a mixed drink if you were planning to hit the tables later. The margaritas never seem to disappoint! oh and also, they have TVs on both side of the bar for your sports watching entertainment!
