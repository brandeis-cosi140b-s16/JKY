Best place for Mexican food in Madison HANDS DOWN.

Great assortment of options - from specials like Camarones a la Diabla  (Spiiiiiicy!) to your quintessential Mexican fare like tacos, enchiladas, tostadas - all done with an 'authentic', spicy, flavorful flare!

Ambiance is very mom+pop-ish - understated, very cramped, mixture of families, singles, and a few good friends.  AKA not the kind of place you go on a nice date.  Still, somehow this modesty adds to the fun for me (and I think it does for the other patrons as well).  

Love it.
