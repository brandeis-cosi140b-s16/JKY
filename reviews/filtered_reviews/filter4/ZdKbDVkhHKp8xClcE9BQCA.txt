Read about this place for cheap eats os 2012 during my visit to Vegas. Place was not hard to find and so glad I made the trip out. The bulgogi nachos were amazing and the prices are really reasonable. The nachos were crisp and full of flavors. The bulgogi was so tender and juicy. The cheese was stringy and sweet. All the flavors blended together so well. Had the chicken taco which was amazing and tasted so authentic. Wish I could have one of these in my neighborhood because this would be weekly visit and definitely a drunkie's dream come true!
