This is the place you come to when you are already drunk and looking to just have some weird wild fun. I came here with my friends after we had been partying for a bit and we were looking to continue our fun. The drinks were strong, the music was blasting, and the people were weird (a man in a care bear unicorn outfit?). I don't think I would eat here but I would come back to drink, dance, and be merry.
