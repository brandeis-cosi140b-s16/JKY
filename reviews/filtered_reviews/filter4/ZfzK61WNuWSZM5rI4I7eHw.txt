We loved this place since they were located next to the Smith's on Flamingo, small intimate, but then they expanded to their location on Spring Mountain, it was big and very nicely decorated but they closed up even though it always appeared to be busy, we thought they were gone for good, but then we discovered their newest location at Village square and are enjoying once again great food and service. 

I love the happy hour, who doesnt love margaritta's! They serve roasted onions and jalapena with radish, soup with the meal and they gave us complmentary desert. 

I chose the combination plate, chili relleno, beef taco and chili verde enchilada. It was very good. My husband got a steak it was grilled and very tender! It was a good meal. Always good food great service and good margaritta's!
