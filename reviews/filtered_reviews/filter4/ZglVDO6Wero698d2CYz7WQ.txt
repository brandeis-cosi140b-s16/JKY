Although I did not eat in the restaurant, and I didn't even see it since my husband picked up the food, I have to say that what I had was excellent. I had chicken tacos and beef tacos (crispy tortilla shells) and my husband had the chili rellenos. 

I know that what I had is practically gringo food and might not seem the best thing to review, but I disagree. Sometimes, it's the simple things that can indicate greatness. And if that's true, I'm sold on Salsa Blanca. The restaurant is in a strip shopping center on 67th Avenue and 101. It's menu is pretty typical Mexican, but it's the execution of those menu items that is important, right?

My tacos (both the chicken and the beef) were nicely seasoned. I've been to many places like this where I've had to eaten salt-sodden food and this place does a good job with seasoning. The salsas were very good as well, though the hot was merely medium. There was not a lot of grease and there was plenty of cheese on the tacos.

I'm happy that we on the west side have such a good Mexican restaurant as Ninfa's hardly qualified. It was horrible. Nice-looking ambiance but horrible food and even worse prices. 

I am hoping that we in the Arrowhead area patronize this place so it doesn't have to close its doors like half of the other quality restaurants, gone undiscovered for too long a time, have. Eat local and patronize local businesses. I'm not sure, but I don't think this is a chain. 

All I can say is that I'm a huge foodie and this place passed my first test with flying colors!
