I am so excited that this place joined the neighborhood. When we stepped foot in, I was immediately wowed by the d√©cor....it is just gorgeous and visually pleasing. The staff were very friendly, even when we were standing around one of the many entrances not sure where the hostess stand was. No joke, there are like 4 ways you can enter from the outside. 

I ordered a house margarita (not a fan) and the chilaquiles. The dish was very good....definitely a fan! The chips, guac, and salsa were good. Since I did not like my margarita, I switched with my husband who had the blood orange rita. Way better. 

The food took a really long time to come but it was a nice surprise when the manager or owner came to the table to apologize without any mention from us. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of this place and everything that came with it!
