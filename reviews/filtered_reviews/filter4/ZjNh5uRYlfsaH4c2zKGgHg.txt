Losbeto's on Hayden, let me introduce you to your first viable competitor in the department of drive thru mexican: Fiesta Burrito.

While not as cheap as Losbeto's, the food is definitely higher quality and you don't get that sneaking sensation that you might be eating roadkill, which is worth an extra buck or two. Nor do you have to allay worries that the gentleman on the other side of the window doesn't heed the "Lavaselas!" sign, as is the case with some. 

Nope, Fiesta is a dream come true in many respects, and is a clean and legitimate competitor to its northern neighbor (why do I suddenly feel like Joe Biden talking about Barack Obama?). The location is convenient, the service is fast, and though the bargain basement prices aren't quite there as in some others, peace of mind is, which will bring me back very soon I'm sure.
