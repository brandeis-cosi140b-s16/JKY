This place is very creative, love the atmosphere, and cool menu. the chips and dip which they start you with are not that great.

The tacos, however, were amazing. I forget which tacos we had, but it was the pork one, the "eel taco", and the bean/chick peas taco. Overall the pork one was by far the best. However, i thought all three were very fresh and creative. I look forward to going back and trying more. 

We also had one of their mango (or was it watermellon?) margaritas, and that was AMAZING. 

I would say that it was very expensive for how much food we actually got.
