Blue Adobe is a favorite of mine. I have been coming here for years and loved it every time. The menu is really unique offering New Mexican Cuisine with a flair. They have a myriad of daily specials featuring beef, pork, chicken, and even seafood.

The outside of the building is hardly impressive, and the neighborhood is wanting... Although, the interior has a nice clean, warm, modern feel.

Everything I have tried here was a success - so be bold and explore the entire menu.
