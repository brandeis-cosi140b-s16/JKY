Good carne adovada which is one of my favorites. Habenero Cheeseburger (comes with a glass of milk) will light your @@@ on fire too. Cool unique ambiance, nice menu, good staff, service has always been very good. Hint: nice late night Happy Hour for you restaurant peeps kitchen open late til like 1AM or so! 

One thing that I dont like is that they dont allow dogs on their huge (often empty) patio. My dog even has service dog tags and the owner wouldnt let him in so we dont go on Sundays anymore with the folks. I dont mark em down for this, but some people ONLY go where they can bring their dog and they could do it here and it would be awesome. We just go somewhere else now instead. Read this and start letting dogs there and we will throw a huge Yappy Hour on the patio and pack the place dude!
