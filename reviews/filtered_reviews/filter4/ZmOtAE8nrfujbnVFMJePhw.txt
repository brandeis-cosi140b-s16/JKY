The outdoor patio is the best. It's on a fantastic spot overlooking the strip and when the weather is nice in the evenings it's a perfect location to get yo' drink on. There are live bands that play outside. I had one empanada the entire night. It was awesome - light and fluffy with crispy on the outside and warm seasoned goo-beef on the inside. Will definetly order that next time I make it here. There is a ton of seating, both barstools at tables and padded patio furniture at low tables. Service is good - friendly and attentive. The bathrooms are far from the patio, though - down the dark stairs, into the dark restaurant, and down the dark hallway. So if you're drinking too much, expect to eat shit at least one time during your many trips to the can.
