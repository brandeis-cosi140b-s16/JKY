We usually go to the Mexican place down the street out of convenience but since it has changed names, food hasn't been the same. Not that it was ever spectacular but Juan's? This place is awesome!

Chips were great and not greasy, I love the complimentary grilled veggies and they even tossed in fideo soups for both my son and I (it usually only comes with an entree at other places and I ordered the app nachos and he the kid's meal). Service was really exceptional. Omar waited on us and there was also another lady that really took care of us. Drinks were filled without being asked and dirty plates were taken away without being noticed. I had mentioned it was my first time and Omar brought us churros at the end of the meal! 

Food was great and portions plenty. I ate about a third of my nachos and the kiddo didn't finish his kids meal either. I really digged the environment,  decor and murals too. Considering this used to be a no-frills BBQ place, they really amped up the Mexican theme. The flaming fajitas tableside really added to the fun of the whole place and we enjoyed being wowed when others ordered it.

Juan's is def my new neighborhood spot for Mexican.
