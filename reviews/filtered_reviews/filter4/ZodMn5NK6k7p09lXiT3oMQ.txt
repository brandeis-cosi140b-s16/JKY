Tonight was my first time here. The place is pretty nice. Our service was good. My drinks were amazing. I had a passion fruit & a guava margarita on the rocks.My food was absolutely delicious with the exception of the white rice that came with my meal. I had the corn maza quesadillas with chicken as an appetizer which was amazing. My cheese enchiladas, I ordered them "Christmas style" which is with both the red & green sauce, was made to perfection. Now the rice and beans that came with the meal, not so good. Especially the rice. It tasted undercooked and really bland. I did manage to have their flan for dessert and it was delicious!!! The kids had the Mac and cheese which they ate without a problem. Our server Josh was really nice, very professional and attentive. And we got our food fast. I will def be returning to try out more items on their menu.
