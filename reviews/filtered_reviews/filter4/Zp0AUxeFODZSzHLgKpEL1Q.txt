Good food, decent prices, rude service. 

If you looking for some cheap and greasy (in a good way) Mexican food when on the strip  this place is good. Quick and easy and cooked to order. 

The service was pretty rude. They expect you to speed through the line so they can get to the next person.  They treat you like you have been there before and should know everything. 

All in all I would come back, actually we are in town for another day so we might be back tomorrow.
