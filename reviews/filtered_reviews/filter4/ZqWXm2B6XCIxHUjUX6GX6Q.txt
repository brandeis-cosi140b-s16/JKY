Very, very good!  We ordered 4 asada tacos (1.25 each), 1 pastor taco, 3 tamales (1 chicken 1 beef), 4 fish tacos, side of black beans.

The order arrived in a quick and friendly manner from the bald guy with the goatee.  He was quite courteous and helpful in the ordering process.  We showed up at about 8pm on a Friday night, and the place was about half full with diners and a couple of people waiting for to-go orders, so there was enough room for us to sit and dine.

The platter came with our order plus a bevy of VERY tasty sauces (the roasted flavor in the salsas in fantastic) as well as the side of sauteed onions and peppers, which come in very handy as you add your seasoning touches to your tacos.

The grades were pretty much unanimous from our table:

Tacos Asada:  8/10.  Very good, and improved with the use of the hot green salsa.
Tacos Pastor:  9/10.  WOW, did not expect that lovely BBQ sweetness!
Tamales:  6/10.  Too dry, and our nine year old declared the beef one to be "too bland"
Black Beans: 10/10. perfectly seasoned and not overly worked into a thick paste like so many other places.
Fish Tacos:  9.25/10.  Pretty much near perfection, can't really think of any better ones in the Valley!

Overall: 8.5 out of ten.  If the tamales improve, we'll be rewriting this and giving them a well-deserved 5 stars!
