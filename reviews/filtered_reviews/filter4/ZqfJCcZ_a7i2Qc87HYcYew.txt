Not bad!  We stumbled upon this place a few weeks ago.  My hubby had eaten here before so he showed me the ropes, so to speak.  They have a large menu and it can be quite overwhelming, especially if you go during lunch and everyone else seems to know what they want.  If you have to stare at the menu for a while, it's best to step aside or you will be trampled.  Not knowing what I was doing, the employees were quick to suggest things and very helpful and patient.  The food was good, but a little bland.  Spice it up a little people!  It's a Mexican food restaurant!
