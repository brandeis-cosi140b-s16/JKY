I'm so happy that there is a La Santisima near me now. Although not very large, this location isn't nearly as cramped as the original location, and overall, the service was much better! The food was as tasty as the original location. I had the mole quesa and my husband had the al pastor quesa. Both were delicious. I'll definitely be back.
