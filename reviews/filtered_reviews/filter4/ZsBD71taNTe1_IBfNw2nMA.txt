If the food wasn't sooooo good I probably wouldn't come back. This place doesn't know what it is it's a fast casual with expensive plates and honestly not enough employees.  They bring the food out to you and if they ever get really busy they will lose customers to the lack of speed. Del taco is right next door guys.  If you want to make it you need to figure out what you are. Don't bring the food to the table call out a number. Ditch the expensive plates and go for paper plastic or something less artsy fartsy. The food is great but the execution really needs work.
