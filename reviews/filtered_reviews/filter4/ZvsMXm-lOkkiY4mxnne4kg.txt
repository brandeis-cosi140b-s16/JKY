Delicious food, lots of options! Just like chipotle but Hawaiian style. They had vegetarian options for me and they were great and flavorful. 

Only thing is they didn't fill up my bowl as much as I would've liked. The workers were very friendly and probably would've given me more toppings had I asked, but they might've charged extra, I'm not sure. Their portions are still good, but could possibly be on the smaller side depending on what you add in. 

Still delicious, though, and a must try! I will be back.
