I've read good things about Morenos, so we decided to give it a try. Among walking in, I felt very squished!! the seating is so tight, and we were all in the way of the servers bringing out food. The chips and salsa are great flavored, but extremely watered down!! it was basically like dipping a chip in flavored water....no scooping salsa deliciousness up:( I ordered a mango margarita, but I quickly realized that was a mistake!  It tasted like it came from a pre-made bottled mix. Yuck!! Our food was great though. I got a burrito with green chiles,shredded beef, and some other yummy fillings - wonderful!!  and my husband and kids got the mango/shrimp quesadilla, and the nachos. I love how they have a menu of exciting flavor combos!!
