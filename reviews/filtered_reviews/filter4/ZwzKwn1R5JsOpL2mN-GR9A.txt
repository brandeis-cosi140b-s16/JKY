Outstanding New Mexican cuisine.  One of the only joints in the downtown Phoenix area with honest-to-god green chile.  Fantastic brunch/breakfast menu (I love me some carne adovada with eggs). 

NM plates are always tasty.  Fresh fish specials are unbelievable when they hit.  It ain't cheap, the wait can be a bear (reservations are a good idea), and the service can be spotty, but the food is unbeatable.

Dick's around the corner has the same menu in a different setting.
