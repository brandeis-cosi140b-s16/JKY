My coworker and I ate here twice during the weekend we were in Phoenix.  This place looks like a little nothing hole-in-the-wall, but the food is absolutely fabulous.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the guy running the cash register refused to give Alex a receipt (which he needed to get reimbursed for work) because he paid cash.  He asked twice and was told both times that IT IS THEIR POLICY NOT TO GIVE RECEIPTS TO CASH CUSTOMERS.  Something hinky is definitely going on here.

Alex ordered the carne asada burrito both times and was thrilled both times.  He went on and on about how good it was.  I tried the barbacoa burrito, and it was really good.  They gave me generous amounts of perfectly spiced tender juicy barbacoa meat, rice, beans, veggies, and salsa.  We ordered chips and salsa and they gave us a generous basket full of chips and ore than one kind of salsa.  

This place has SERIOUSLY good food, even if their business accounting practices are a little shady.
