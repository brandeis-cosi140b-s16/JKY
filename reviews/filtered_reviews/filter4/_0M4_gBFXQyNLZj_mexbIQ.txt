I wasn't really sure how I would feel about a mexican/korean fusion joint but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. This place really exceled at the fusion tacos, especially the bulgogi (beef) tacos which really went well together. Also I was really impressed by the fried rice as well. The only down side was the spicy pork was a bit of a dissapointment, not that it was bad, but I have had better elsewhere. Staff was nice and friendly and the price was very reasonably as well.
