Yesterday my friend and I went here. It was pretty good. I like that they let you sample the Kalua pig and Huli Huli chicken but a little bummed they did not offer the pulehu steak... I ordered the pulehu steak burrito with beans, jalapenos, habaneros (sweeet not many places have it), lettuce, sour cream cheese, cabbage, maui onion salsa (awesome) guacamole on the side. As I previously read through the reviews the guacamole was definitely fresh, homemade and a huge side! If I had known the pulehu steak was in some sort of sauce or glaze I would not have ordered it. It would have been great with rice. 
A little bummed there was only brown rice or brown rice with seaweed, I do not eat brown rice. The other sauces or gels were not what I expected. Very sweet.
My friend ordered the kalua pig burrito and absolutely loved it!
When I come back again I am going to try the veggie burrito with the same fixings and I know it is going to be onolish!
