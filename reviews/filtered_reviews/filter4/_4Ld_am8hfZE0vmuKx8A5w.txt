Serrano's is definitely on point!  We have been driving by, anticipating the opening for weeks.  In reading up on the establishment, it appears that it's location number 2. The original is in Alaska.

We practically ordered everything, just so we could really get a great feel of their flavors.  Upon ordering the staff was great and attentive.  You order at the front counter, but it's not really fast food.  They make it to order and you can chill in the restaurant and watch the game on one of there TV's.  

We started with some ceviche which was made with mahi mahi.  It was good (not as good as my boos secret recipe, but still good).  We dove head first into the salsa bar where we fell in love.  There are a lot of great choices, some super hot, others with superb flavor.  All very good.  I had the chicken enchiladas with a red sauce.  Super fresh, not greasy... So tasty.  Their rice and beans were fantastic, too.  I also had an adobada taco which packed some heat and was really delicious.  

I'm excited about this place, especially since they will soon have beer. Go here!
