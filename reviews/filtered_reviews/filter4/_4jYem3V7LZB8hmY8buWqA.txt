We dined here last night and had a nice experience. We were seated right away and within minutes of being seated the chips and two dips were presented.  We ordered the ceviche de camaron, ensenada-style fried fish taco and the al mojo de ajo "picoso".  The ceviche was the star of the meal: it came in a HUGE goblet and had chunks of shrimp and avocado and plenty of lime wedges.  The fish taco was fine and the picoso chicken was flavorful and delicious, especially when eaten with the guacamole it came with. 
The waitstaff were very attentive: no empty glasses or dirty dishes left on the table.  They were very friendly and personable.
We will definitely come back to try out their margaritas!
