Yummy! The chicken on the nachos has a great flavor. I really enjoy them but could use more cheese. I mean cheese is most important on nachos (hence 4 stars not 5) but been twice and will return. Maybe I'll even try something else. Not sure I love good Nachos and best in area so far. Good pricing too.
