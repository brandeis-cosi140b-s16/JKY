This place seriously took me by surprise! It's actually good! I thought it was your typical Mexican American  restaurant that doesn't satisfy you at all. 

We came during happy hour and ordered rolled chicken tacos that were only $5. We also ordered a one person chicken fajita to share.  

On the house they give you chips and salsa with refried beans. Chips were warm and perfect! Then they give you a tomato sopa that was tasty but a slight salty. 

When the fajitas came.... FIREEEE! They put on a cool fire show with your fajitas and it's comes so hot and sizzling! The one person fajita was more than enough for me and my girlfriend. The rolled tacos were okay and kinda greasy. 

Actually will come back for more fajitas!
