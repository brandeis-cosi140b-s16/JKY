After not being able to get a reservation at any of the restaurants at the Belaggio and fighting the crowds, I went on Yelp to find nearby restaurants.  We found this lovely place inside the Venetian Hotel and made an online reservation.  They sat us near the canal, which was lovely.  It was nice and quiet compared with the crowds in other parts of the hotels.  The food was tasty and my dish delicious.  My wife and daughter truly enjoyed as well!
