Went here for the happy hour, and let me tell you, my 1630-1830 happy hour indeed was a happy one. I went with a couple of co workers on a Tuesday and we all got the "Big azz margarita" I chose the 22oz mango margarita on the rocks and it was delicious, a good punch of alcohol and still the mango flavor, which was only 7.00 by the way. I also got the half off wings special as well, got the classic mild buffalo wings, and those too, were a good choice.

The place is a little small but is in a pretty good location right off bates and Atwood. seating is limited but it didn't matter, because the atmosphere Andre servers were very welcoming. I think we found our new happy hour slash pre game spot!
