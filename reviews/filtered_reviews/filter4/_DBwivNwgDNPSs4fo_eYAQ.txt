This is an awesome spot--so awesome that once I discovered it and some other gems in this area, I was instantly regretful that I didn't live in Brookline!

The tacos are delicious and filling, and the butcher inside the grocery is amazing. The meat is really reasonably priced and they have the most delicious, fresh, perfectly spiced chorizo I've ever tasted.

The staff are friendly and helpful. I had a really good shopping experience here and it's a great place to find ingredients for Latin and/or Caribbean cooking.
