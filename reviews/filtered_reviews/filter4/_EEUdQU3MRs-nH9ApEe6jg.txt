I finally made it to phat burrito!! I have been dying to try this place out. My rating is more of a 3.5 star. 
Some things you should know, extremely nice lady who takes your order. 
Most burrito and quesadillas are around $7-8. 
Tacos are super cheap, around $3...but they only give you ONE. So it will not be enough if you are trying to have a meal. I recommend the taco with mango sauce!!! Chunks of mangos in it, to die for and super refreshing!!
My tofu burrito was definitely different, the tofu did not even taste like tofu. The lady who took my order was not lying when she said the tofu are well seasoned! She even packed in grilled veggie and lettuce, tomato and cucumber in there for me! Well hello, definitely get the tofu over veggie since it's the same price but you can have extra!
This place even has a salsa bar, which I uploaded a picture of, check it out! They got your salsa from mild to extremely hot.
The outdoor seating is nicer than the inside of the restaurant, in my opinion. The umbrellas outdoor can be adjusted!!
The only complaint I have about this place is I am not sure if the sanitation could be a tad better? Well I guess I am particularly speaking about the bathroom. The female barbie is the girls bathroom and the male barbie is guys, I did not know this until I was looking really hard for the sign for women and men haha which does not exist. The bathroom inside I guess is a bit old, the faucet doesnt have much water coming out and the turn knobs are a bit weird and loose. There is also some hair on the sink...
Anyway, the food is pretty good, I'd say like 4/5. 
Come give them a try!
