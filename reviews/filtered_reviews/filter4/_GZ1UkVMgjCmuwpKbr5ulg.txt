Have had this place bookmarked for ages! Finally had to give it a try after hearing it was featured on food network. What lured me in to trying out Paradise Valley Burger Company was all of the vegetarian choices! They have a great variety for vegetarians, tacos, sandwich, and you can get a portobello mushroom in place of a burger patty!
My friend and I went on a Friday night and it was pretty packed! The restaurant is small, not a whole lot of seating, and we got ours to go. When we ordered we were warned that it would take about 20-30 minutes to get our food and we almost changed our minds, but luckily it did not end up taking that long! I ordered the paradise burger with a portobello mushroom, and my friend ordered a bacon cheeseburger. I also got a side of sweet potato tater tots. I sort of wish I would have ordered something else, because I feel like the mushroom wasn't seasoned enough or something, but the rest of the "burger" was tasty. Sweet potato tots were delicious as well. Wishing I would have tried the lucky charms marshmallow milkshake..but maybe next time! My friend liked his burger too. Would recommend this place to meat lovers and vegetarians.
