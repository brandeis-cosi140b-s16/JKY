New favorite lunch location. Sam is great and willing to do whatever it takes for his costumer to love the experience. Chips are pretty good, could be a little warmer. Very friendly staff. Very fresh and healthy burrito toppings. 

I usually get the burrito on special or .99 cent tacos on Tuesday. Love this place!
