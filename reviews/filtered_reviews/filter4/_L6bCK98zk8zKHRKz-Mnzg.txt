The food is just okay but the service was amazing at my last visit and so I'm giving it a "4." This is a reliable place with food the whole family likes, with the kids often being the deciding factor. [Don't go here if you're a foodie, though.] The patio is dog friendly and you still get good service which is unusual at many restaurants where you are forgotten out there unless the patio is packed. Lauren was our waitress and she really goes above and beyond plus has a friendly yet sassy attitude that I loved!!
