If your from New Mexico or just love New Mexico green chile, this is the place to go.  It is the only place on Las Vegas/Henderson to serve authentic, fresh New Mexico Hatch green chile.  We have been buying 30 pound bags of the stuff from them for years now. The food is amazing and fast. The environment if very casual and relaxing.  You can order anything from a smothered burrito with green chile, red chile, or Christmas style (both) to stuffed sopapillas and Frito pie.  It has all the great flavors of New Mexico.  The only thing missing form the menu is a green chile burger (can't understand why they don't sell these!)  Everything is great though and prices are cheap.
