I've been here twice and just simply love it. My first time coming here was random, I had originally intended to go to Oregano's but when their wait was over an hour, I figured "Hey, why not?". Best decision ever. Their food is delicious and fresh, and the service is great. The prices aren't the cheapest, but it's certainly not expensive. I love the outdoor patio! I would recommend their guacamole (drizzled with agave syrup!), fish tacos, and the sangria. I will definitely keep coming back!

The only reason this isn't 5 stars, is because I've only been here a coupe of times. Will update the more I go.
