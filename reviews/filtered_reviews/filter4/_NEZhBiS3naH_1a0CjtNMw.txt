I have been wanting to try this place for a little while now.  So when we had visitors in town that wanted some Mexican food, I thought what a perfect time to come check out this place. Although it really is off the beaten path for me, it was worth the trip to experience what Korean Mexican fusion was really all about.  The waiter brought out complimentary homemade chips with guac and salsa dip to start our night out.  We ordered the bulgogi burrito and kimchi fried rice and our friends had their fusion tacos.  Both dishes were quite good and fulfilling.  The portion size is huge and the ingredients inside were very fresh.  Although the bulgogi could have been more flavourful, their special house sauce and other hot sauce condiments really made the burrito stand out.  I really enjoyed this fusion restaurant, but because it is so far away from me, I think I will only be coming here if I am in the neighborhood for some other reason.  I took one star off because I had to ask the waitress for a knife to cut the huge burrito and extra plates so we can share our dishes.
