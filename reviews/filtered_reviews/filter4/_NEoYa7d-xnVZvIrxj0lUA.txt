I remember seeing the Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives that featured Los Taquitos, but never got the urge to drive all the way down to Ahwatukee to try it out, so when the sign went up in the center near my office I was excited!

The interior is really modern and they have a huge bar, which from what I hear, is very different from the original location, but they are trying to step it up a notch!  You still order at the counter and get a number, which I love, and take out doesn't take that long either.

I have tried the chicken quesadilla and the carne asada quesadilla and loved them both.  The green salsa goes great with the chicken quesadilla, which was a helpful tip from one of the owners.  One of the best parts of the quesadilla experience here is that it is not greasy at all!  They use a white cheese (jack I think) and use just enough to make it cheesy without overwhelming it with grease, plus they cut them up in cute little squares that makes it great for sharing.  They also have good guacamole.

The only downside so far is the beans....they are a bit on the runny side....but with so many other options at reasonable prices...I guess I can overlook this!
