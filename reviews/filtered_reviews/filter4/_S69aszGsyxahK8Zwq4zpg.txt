Good service. Great outdoor seating with musters. We got the appetizer of queso, Guac, and pineapple salsa. Everything needed tons of salt but it was good. Thy charge for extra chips which is lame cause the basket is tiny and we had 6 people all eating. Waffle fries looked good but I didn't get them. I got the AZ burrito which I HIGHLY recommend. Also street cart tacos. The food was great but service was just okay for me.
