located in treasure island - a great place for dinner before the 7pm mystere show because they open at 4:30pm.  started off with a pitcher of margaritas.. done right!  the guacamole was fresh and tasty.   all of us had the fajitas (2 veggie and 2 chicken) and loved them!  i had the vegetarian fajitas - bell peppers, onions, and other veggies.  got them "alambre style", which is topped with melted cojita cheese.. so good and worth it!   the best thing, by far, was the kahlua creme brulee!  don't pass it up!  all in all, a good dinner and conveniently located a few steps away from the mystere theatre!
