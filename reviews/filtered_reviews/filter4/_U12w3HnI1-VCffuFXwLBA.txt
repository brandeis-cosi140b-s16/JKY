After a long few weeks at work and a rare Saturday off for me, a co-worker and I decided we would seize the moment and make it a day. We planned a brunch at the Border Grill which was delicious. Getting to the restaurant was a little confusing as I have a hard time making my way around casinos and it was located more in the convention and shark reef area. We arrived for our reservation and requested patio seating, it was nice to look outside but it was more enclosed than I would have preferred! Our server, such a nice girl I wish I remembered her name, explained the menu and got us started right away on our $10 bottomless mimosas which she suggested we try one of each. She was so nice and attentive always making sure our glasses were full, our orders were taken, and not rushing us one bit. Brunch is $34.99 all-you-can-eat with a menu of tasty items you can pick one of each of or re-ordering your favorites. We tried just about every item and every mimosa and were not disappointed.
