Mariscos Playa Hermosa was picked for May's International Supper Club UYE and we had a big turnout expected 14 but had around 26 to 30 and I have to say management & servers didn't blink an eye when I kept asking for another chair please.  Excellent customer service!  

The parking lot is very very small, maybe can park 8 to 12 cars, but there is plenty of parking on the street, so that what I did, once inside the place is very colorful and inviting.

I ordered the 3 carne asada tacos with beans and rice. They were great street tacos perfect for what I was craving. The beans and rice were ok, over all it was a good dish and with tax included came in under 10 bucks! That's a great deal for dinner!  

After everyone was done eating they brought us out 5 different types of cakes/dessert to try, chocolate cake, tres leches cake, coconut cake, cheese cake & flan. I'm a chocolate lovin fool and the chocolate cake was perfect, it was sweet, rich and full of chocolaty goodness, but my favorite I have to say was the Tres Leches Cake, that stuff was amazing! Also the coconut cake was great too! 

I defiantly will be coming back to try a few other of their dishes for sure!
