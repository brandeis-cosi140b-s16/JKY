I went to Ranch Market specifically to try the Tres Leches cake. It wasn't the best I've had, but was tasty enough to satisfy my Tres Leches cravings now that I won't be returning to Houston on a regular basis any longer. The cake was moist and sweet. There was a little too much "frosting" on top for my liking, but that can always be scraped off. Next time I'd like to try the chocolate.
