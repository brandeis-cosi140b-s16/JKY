This was my second time going to Diablo's Cantina. This time it was around noon on a weekday. My friend and I sat at the bar and ordered a couple of rounds of bahama breeze's, Golden Cadillacs, a screwdriver and a few of their beers on special which was about $3-$5 for your basic beers. The first time I came to Diablo's Cantina it was on a Saturday night and its definitely a different animal then it is at noon although this place is always high vibe and upbeat; the bartender asked me to step on the bar and spin the wheel before we left he rings a bell and the wheel determines the next happy hour special. I love their entire theme its so much fun! As far as the food goes just  excellent! I ordered quesadillas and the loaded nachos. The staff was really friendly and attentive but not intrusive. I love my experience the only cons were that in my opinion the drinks weren't strong enough and I do think that their prices are a bit high but then again its the strip and everywhere is expensive so I would give this place a lovely 4 stars.
