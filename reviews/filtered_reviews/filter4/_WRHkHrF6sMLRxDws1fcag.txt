it does Not get more REAL than this my friends.

As I journey deeper into the Mexican Culture I find so many jewels.  Ritos Mexican Take out steps out to be a staple for what Phoenix has to  offer.

Wow, Green Chili Burritos! I love the bee burritos, and defiatly has a spicy kick to it.  Take a Venture into a Phoenix neighborhood to find great burritos and tacos on Tuesdays. 



Ah the Haters,   this place is so good it has started a small group of haters blogging about their disappointment.   I find this hater yelp phenomenon in many great restaurant concepts.  If so many people love the place the force is balanced with a group of haters that must respond to so many positive comments.  

Destination location for sure

Let me know what you think,
