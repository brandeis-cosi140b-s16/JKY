Ordered the taco meal with steak, beans and rice on the side, and pink lemonade as the drink.

Incredible flavor lived up to the hype! Taco came bursting with juicy steak, heaps of delicious guacamole, sour cream, and other vegetables. Rice and beans were also well done, not a poorly cooked grain of rice or bean in the whole meal.

It's a very casual spot - you order your food at a counter, they hand you a little tent with a number on it, and bring the food to your table after a dozen or so minutes.

Be warned: for us, portions were definitely smaller than expected at the price, and a meal will leave you hungry (unless you order something very hearty like their burrito or nacho-esque fries).
