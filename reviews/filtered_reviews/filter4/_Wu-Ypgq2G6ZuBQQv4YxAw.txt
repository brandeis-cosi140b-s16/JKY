Taste + Location + Price = 4 Stars

The food isn't mind blowing. It isn't the best Mexican I've had. But for the price, location, and the taste, it's worth giving them a try.

I only had their tacos. They were cheap and pretty good. A bit on the soggy side with all the sauce, like I said not the best I've had but good. Has a street taco / backyard / homemade taco kind of taste.

The rice was plain white rice so I didn't bother trying it (come on, serve that delicious Spanish rice).

"Hey I'm right on the Vegas Strip and I want some tacos."
"Man, I'm right on the strip and I want something cheap, fast, but still pretty good."
"Dude, all this walking around and drinking... I need some quick good food."
"I can sure go for some tacos."
Give DJ's a try.
