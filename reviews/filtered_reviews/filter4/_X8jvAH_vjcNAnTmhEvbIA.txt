First if you're looking for a place that speaks English or has great service, keep walking. 

The menu is on a board and there are two cooking stations. You order your food then pay at the cashier. It's not the most organized place, but if you expected that then you were dreaming.

I'd say the tacos are the best deal at $2 because the are basic street tacos with onions, cilantro, salsa and guacamole. The quesadilla and vampiro were small and double the price. The carne asada fries were huge, tasty, but the fries were a little cold and after a while everything tasted the same.

I can see why it's busy. The tacos are tasty. I only tried carne asada since that's what everyone on Yelp raved about.
