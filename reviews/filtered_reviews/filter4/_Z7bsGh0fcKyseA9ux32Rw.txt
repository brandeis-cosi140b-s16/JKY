I was brought here by chance on Christmas Eve. It was a welcomed change from other valley Mexican restaurants. The open patio in the back with the turtle and duck pond really was magical. I had the pleasure of trying their shrimp taco suave and their taco fritas. The taco suave was particularly good. It had onions and red cabbage. Put a little bit of their homemade salsas on them and wach their taste explode. Very savory and spicy. I was pleased to find such a flavorful and authentic restaurant so far off the beaten path.
