I stopped in for lunch today.  The portions were HUGE and the toppings were plentiful!  I ordered a veggi burrito.  It was great!  The tortilla was freshly made and the toppings were fresh as well.  Service was quick but the place was super crowded and there wasn't enough seating.  I'm likely to return for dinner but probably not for lunch if I am in a hurry.
