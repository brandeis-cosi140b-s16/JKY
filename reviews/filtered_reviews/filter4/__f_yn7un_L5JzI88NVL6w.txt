We came here after a late night and when we left the sun was rising.  It's right beside Sapphire strip club but don't be put off by that.  The staff is friendly, the chips and salsa are great and the food is good.  I ordered the Mahi fish tacos and found it to be a bit greasy because of the oil they pan fried it in.  Hubby had the chicken fajita and it was pretty good.  The service was a bit slow probably because it was late, very late.  Overall good experience.
