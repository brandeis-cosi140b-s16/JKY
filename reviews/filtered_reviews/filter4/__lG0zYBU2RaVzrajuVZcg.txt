Food was delicious. Great portion sizes and it tasted fresh! I would defiantly come here again, maybe sit outside next time ( we sat inside).  
Our waiter was very attentive and knew the menu which is what it should be everywhere. He even offered me what I got for lunch. it was very good. 
The location was good, close to everything in the city center, parking is under most buildings.
