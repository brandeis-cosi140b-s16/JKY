The Details:

-Sunday Brunch 10:00am - 3:00pm
-Bottomless flavored margaritas and mimosas
-Mimosas use fruit puree, not syrups
-AYCE brunch buffet; items seem to mostly stay the same week to week
-Fresh tortillas!
-Accommodates large parties
-No auto gratuity

The food is decent, but you get fresh tortillas and fresh guacamole!  The margaritas may been a bit weaker than you're used to, but they're bottomless!  Service has been great, as the groups I've been with have been known to stay for three hours or longer, and the staff never gives us a hard time.  It's a fun little place to start your Sunday mornings with a little alcohol.
