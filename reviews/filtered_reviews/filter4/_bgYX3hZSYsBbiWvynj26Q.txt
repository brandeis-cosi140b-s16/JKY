Great place to grab a burger with the family or alone.

The Good:  Easy to find, good parking.  Inside is clean and cute.  Lots of staff there to help with anything you need.  It's one of those classic, limited menus that stood the test of time.  

The food has a really nice presentation to it.  See my pic and others.  Everything looks fresh and the burger is carefully wrapped.  Lot's of attention to detail.  There is a SNAP when you bite through the fresh veggies.  The taco is a nice change, try it once.  A burger, taco, and large drink is $11 and change.

The bad:  Well, unfortunately, I just didn't like the taste of the burger that much.  It's not bad by any means, just not on my tops list.  The combination of spices just didn't hit me the right way, and I didn't get as much veggie taste as I would have liked.  The bun was dry, cracking up a little as I got more into the burger.

That being said, it's still a nice place.  Everyone else seems to like it so maybe it's just my palette.  Everything else about the place is good so I have no problem recommending it.
