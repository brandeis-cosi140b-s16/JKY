Frank & Lupe's is a typical, no-frills Mexican food joint. Sometimes it's very, very crowded, and being a small place it can be kind of frustrating. Having said that,  I think it says something that people will repeatedly wait to eat here. I have never been disappointed. I usually get the fish tacos which are served with soft tortillas and you can substitute blue corn for no charge. 
Their chips and salsa are slightly addictive. Rather than serving regular chips, Frank & Lupe serves fried tortilla chips which have an amazing crunch. Yes, their salsa is a little watery, but it's not short on spice or flavor. They offer you one basket on the house and then additional baskets are a couple bucks. 
Service tends to be adequate. I find I get my food and drinks within a reasonable amount of time. Small-sized house margaritas are $5.50 and provide a nice kick. 
I also like sitting on the patio--which oddly enough has windows--but you can feel like you're outside but enjoy the AC. No complaints on a 110 degree day!
