Having driven through this area several times before we've passed by this place and every time we did we'd say - we really need to try that place! So, with no plans for food last night and both of us having the night off, we looked up our bookmarks and hit this place up!

It's a smaller location with a tight parking lot that also has a drive-thru as a part of it.  When walking across the parking lot, be sure to pay attention to incoming cars since it can be a bit of a blind turn for them and you will be walking directly in the parking lot pull-in and drive-thru pull-in path. 

Once you are safely inside the menu is short and to the point. You can get the classic burger with or without cheese and a variety of toppings. There are a couple of types of tacos and two or three options for side orders like fries or chips.  Finally, for drinks they have bottled sodas, bottled water or milkshakes!  We both had the classic with cheese since that seemed like the staple item on the menu and when we try a place the first go round we like to try what it is known for.  We each also ordered a side of fries.  I had a shake and she opted for a bottle of water.  

The burger was really tasty and I had swapped the regular onions for grilled onions, and I preferred that way over her regular ones. The fries were definitely delicious, but a touch over salted for my taste - we could easily have split an order instead of getting one order each.  The stand sauce was a great addition to pretty much everything edible on the tray!  We'll be back and we'll be trying out those taco options!
