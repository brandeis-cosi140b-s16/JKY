Tacos are pretty good, but nothing too exciting. They all have "edgy" names, which if you know some Spanish slang, might make you a little uncomfortable ordering in front of your kids. 
Prices are decent, rice, beans and chips are really good. 
Like every other place in the container park, there's basically zero seating inside. Great to sit on the patio if the weather is good, not so great in December/January. 
I'm boosting to 4 stars because I like the container park (gentrification complete!).
