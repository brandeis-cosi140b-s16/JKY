I ate here for a work dinner in and it was alright.  We had chips and salsa, asada, strawberry drink, tamales, and it was all decent.  The carmel flan looked nasty and none of us would eat it ;))  Service was  a bit slow in the server bringing us drinks and water.  It is in odd location towards back.
