Me and one of my friends went to Pancho's in downtown summerlin last Sunday - they had just opened October 15/ with a soft opening on the 14th - our server had informed us. 

Anyways, the location is awesome, as the downtown summerlin mall continues to grow, everyone loves Mexican food . So, the location was a no brainer. I personally, could see this place as one of my new happy hour spots. One of those places that could be, "the place", this could be it. 

So, me and my friend come to eat here after I tell her I ve been waiting for this place to open, I call and found out this place just opened ! 

The ambiance and architecture are beautiful. When you go inside, you feel like you went on a vacation, it doesn't feel like the Las Vegas desert anymore ! It feels tropical and the glass windows add something new and inviting ! 

We got free champagne and the lobster taco s were amazing ! My friend's breakfast she said was just ok! Breakfast may not be their speciality ! 

I love the place so far . I d say to lower prices somewhat and add more marketing and incentives for happy hour and ladies' night . In addition, they did say they do karaoke and play music. The bar area is huge ! I ll be back otherwise !
