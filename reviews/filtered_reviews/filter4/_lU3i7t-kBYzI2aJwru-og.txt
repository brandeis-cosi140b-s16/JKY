The husband and I went to Modern Marg for a pre event happy hour. The bar itself is comfortable, with big cushy bar stools. The bartender was friendly and efficient, though his descriptions of the drinks were a little lacking (I asked which of the happy hour margs he would personally get and he replied ' uh, if you want agave nectar get this one... etc, not answering the question, just naming the ingredients, which I already knew). I had the Modern Margarita, which really tasted like tequila on ice. This was ok, especially for only 5$, but not the tastiest marg by any means. The husband had the Victoria beer on tap. The bartender was enthusiastic about this beer, so that was nice, and with good reason, because it was exceptional. We also had the salsa flight, which was very good and satisfying. The smoky salsa was tasty, almost like a bbq salsa, but the best of the three was the pico, which was just the right amount of spicy for a pico and tasted very fresh. The tomatillo salsa was lacking, not amazing. The salsas came with the largest basket of chips I have seen in a long time. We felt like we ate a full bag of chips, and the basket was still half full (yes, I am an optimist). This place is way out of my usual 'hood, so clearly it isn't a place I would frequent, but if they are in your 'hood, I would check them out for happy hour.
