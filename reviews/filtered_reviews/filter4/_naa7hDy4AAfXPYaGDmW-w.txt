Checked this place out when looking for something different in the strip. Insides was pretty neat, nice and open to the outdoors. Waitress was friendly and checked in without having look for her.

Ordered the chicken fajitas, chips and dip, and margaritas. The margaritas were standard and the chips and dip were pretty good. The salsa dip was mild, but had good heat to it, really enjoyed it. The chicken fajitas came out piping hot and a decent selection of sides to add. No complaints here, food was worth coming back for.
