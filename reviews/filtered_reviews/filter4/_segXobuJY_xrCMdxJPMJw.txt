This place is amazing!! Can't say enough good things about this restuarant! The set up is nice and the art work is superb! A great place to go have a date night or a quiet family dinner. The food is always fresh, (highly recommended the el pastor quesadilla!!) 

The only thing negative per se about this place is the service. They really need another waiter. I give respect to the guy that works there solo, but he's so busy hustling and bustling that it's hard for him to give adequately good service when he's rushing through our orders. We have been there 3 times and each time it is the same, 4 or 5 tables and we end up waiting 20 minutes to get a drink order.

I love the atmosphere and food too much to stop going, just hope they hire another waiter in the near future!!

Definitely recommend this place to others!!!
