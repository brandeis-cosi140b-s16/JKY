Come hungry.  The plates are big and full of tasty goodness.  I like to share with friends if possible.  The food is spicy but not so spicy that I find it overwhelming.  Most items comes drizzled with a bit of crema which makes me happy.  They have items like duck enchiladas which you won't find just anywhere.   Plus their drinks are top notch without being too sweet.
