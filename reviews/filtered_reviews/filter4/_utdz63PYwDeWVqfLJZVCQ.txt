We were shopping in the Venetian before going to see the Blue Man Group.  We spied this restaurant (right on the Venetian Canal!!) and ducked in.  Wow, what a great meal!

We were kind of sick of the fatty, high calorie, rich meals we had had over the past few days.  This was excellent.   Most things came with sides of Cilantro rice, and whole black beans.... delicious, low fat and wonderful!  The meal was very filling, but yet felt "healthy" and light.

Our waitress was excellent, and when we said we had to make it to the show, she hurried our order along and was just great.

I had the Mexican style chicken enchiladas, and my son had some kind of beef chimichanga.   All were excellent.  Prices were reasonable, and the food seemed healthy, fresh and light.

The view of the "canal" was also great, and we made our show on time.  I highly recommend it.
