This place rules!!

First of all I should tell you I'm from Philly, home of delicious food. Secondly I should tell you I'm visiting my sister at Pitt, so I've had a lot of 4 & 4.5 star rated on yelp food here in pittsburgh that was sooo gross. So judge me as you may.

But verde was amazing. I can't believe this has 3.5 stars &  DeLucas has 4 (by the way my food was free at DeLucas today because it was so gross and I barely touched it) 

Our bartender (Allie!!) was incredible-- the drinks were so soothe & balanced. The food was delicious, reasonably priced. Ambience great, people friendly.
