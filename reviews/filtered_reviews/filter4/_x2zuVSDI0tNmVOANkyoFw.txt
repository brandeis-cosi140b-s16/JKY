I'm still rating this retaurant a 4 star for previously mentioned reasons, but tonight I just sampled the Chicken Tinga entree, which was absolutely delicious and deserved a shoutout. It's definitely one their most flavorful dishes on the menu. The chorizo adds a whole new depth of flavor and every now and then you get that hint of cilantro which meshes well with the tomato-based background. I'm eating it right now and it may well become a go-to item whenever I come here.
