My daughter actually dragged us to this place, that alone was a miracle that she liked a place sooo much to take US there, lol!  The place is nice "mom and pop" feel to it.  When you first walk in, it looks like a little take out place.  Then, you look to your left and you see this adorable patio type dining area. Very pretty old world decor to it.  I felt like I was in Mexico eating.  My son didn't know what to get, so he asked the waiter what he recommended and he told us the #8. So my son ordered it and LOVED it!  The menu isn't huge but there is plenty to choose from.  Salsa was delish!  The only downfall is that if you are planning to go with a larger group, more than maybe 6 people, you might have a problem getting a table.  Definitely worth checking out!
