Dimly lit, intimate restaurant. It had a very laid back, yet sexy (as my fiance described it) ambiance. Our server was nice but a little forgetful about some little things (eg: ice bucket for our white wine). Overall food was pretty good.

Appetizers:
1) Bacon Wrapped Pan Seared Scallops: well cooked and loved the 4 different dipping sauces (green chile, salsa, tomato?, butter).
2) Stuffed mushrooms: little mushroom heads but they were still good and the sauce wasn't bad.

Entrees:
1) Sea bass in mango sauce with a side of eggplant and potato with green chile
2) New Mexico Enchiladas
3) Ahi Tuna Salad over mixed greens
4) Rokerij burger
- everything was pretty good. My only complaint was that the tuna was a little over cooked (requested it medium rare and it came out more medium/medium-well)
