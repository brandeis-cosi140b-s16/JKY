For what it is, Wahoo's offers solid food at very fair prices.
Nothing we had - from the fish tacos to the beans - blew us out of the water, but the ingredients are fresh, well prepared and the staff just couldn't be friendlier. Plus, they have a great bar with quick, knowledgeable bartenders (a rarity for the Summerlin area). 
The vibe is very California-esque, the sheer variety of taco variations is sure to please most, and the quality of the food is just right for the price. Forget spending $20 at Taco Hell or any of the other abysmal chains, if you're craving unique, fresh tacos it's hard to go wrong at Wahoo's.
