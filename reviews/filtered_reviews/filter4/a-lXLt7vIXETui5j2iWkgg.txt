I grew up in Northern CA, Santa Cruz specifically. I was spoiled with fresh Mission Style Mexican food. This is the closest that has come to it. Their red salsa is amazing and reminds me of the salsa I enjoyed growing up. I ordered 2 red sauce Cheese Enchiladas with rice and beans. It's not as good as NorCal Mexican food but pretty close. It's the best authentic Mexican food I've had in Phoenix! I would've given 5 stars but they didn't bring me my chips right away and brought them right before I got my food.
