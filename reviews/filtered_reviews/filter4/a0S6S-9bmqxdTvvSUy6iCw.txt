Great food! Very authentic! The meat was nice and juicy. The tortillas are warm and not sticky! If you eat lots of tacos you'll know what I'm taking about. My uncle works at the original Tacos el Gordo in Tijuana and I must say I did not expect them to taste so similar to the ones he makes! This place does tend to get packed on late weekend nights so be aware. The price is a little higher than the average taco shop but it's nothing crazy. Go ahead...ENJOY!
