Armed with a fist full of dollars a couple buddies and I stumbled into the Pink Taco wondering what the talent would look like in this place and WTF?  This is a Mexican food place? Good thing we were hungry !!

Sure, it is not an "authentic" Mexican place, but ummm, you are in Las Vegas right? Show me one thing here that is authentic and I will hand you that fist full of dollars I showed up with !!

I was pleasantly surprised with my experience here. Chips and salsa showed up promptly, the drink order was a close second and the guacamole was very good. I enjoyed the shrimp tacos (friend shrimp) and my buddies enjoyed their meals as well. Everything served had a very solid showing and the prices were reasonable.

Why 4 stars?  We sat in the open air patio in the back and enjoyed the oasis away from the mob scene found just outside in the casino. What a great way to catch up with some old friends and I am pretty sure one of them will know how to get to Sapphires anyway.
