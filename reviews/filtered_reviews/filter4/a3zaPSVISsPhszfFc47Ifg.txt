I have always enjoyed eating at this spot it is really cool to walk around after dinner or before... I have eaten at this spot twice both times really great and friendly service. The first trip I went with the (Black And Bleu Quesadilla) Blackened steak sliced and served in a crisp flour tortilla with red onion marmalade and Monterey Jack & Bleu cheese. Served with tomatillo-avocado salsa, chipotle mayonnaise, pico de gallo, cotija cheese and Margarita slaw. Upon my second trip I went with the (Blackened Fish Tacos)  In crisp taco shells with Margarita slaw, pico de gallo and fresh limes on the side. Served with southwest rice and black beans... I rate the food as followed.

Black And Bleu Quesadilla - A+
Blackened Fish Tacos - C 
Chips - A+
Salsa - A

I will be back to this spot for sure an all around great place for a good meal... Plus the white chocolate tamale after dinner treat will keep you coming back for sure.
