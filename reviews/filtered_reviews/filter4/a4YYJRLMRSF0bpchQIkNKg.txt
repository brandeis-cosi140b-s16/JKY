Tacos al pastor... That's the way to go!! This place is an "upscale" Mexican restaurant with hip music and classy d√©cor.  I've tried a few different things on the menu but nothing compares to the Tacos al Pastor. They have the perfect mix of spices, heat, and sweetness from the pineapple pieces. I also LOVE their chips and salsa, the quality of the chips and salsa is usually a good indicator for me of how well I am going to like a  Mexican restaurant...and theirs gets an A+! PS: Give their tres leches dessert a try...its amazing!
