Barrio Queen, you had me at guacamole made freshly before your eyes at your table side!

A friend and I stopped at Barrio Queen for dinner during a recent trip to Scottsdale as we were craving some Mexican food (when in Rome, right?). We happened to be in the very cute downtown area and walked by this spot with its cool artwork, and figured we may as well give it a shot! And boy am I glad we did. 

Right off the bat, service was excellent as we were seated quickly and our server was very personable, attentive, and ready to answer any questions that we had. For starters, we opted for some chips and guacamole and let's just say that decision set the tone for the evening. As previewed above, they make the guacamole fresh before your eyes on a rolling kitchen table type contraption. It was awesome! I love me some guac, and as you may have guessed, their home made version did not disappoint.

For my main course, I opted for three of the freshly prepared tacos that appear to be their calling card to some degree. Specifically, I went with one each of the barrio pollo, salmon con mango, and pescado. All came out wrapped lovingly in fresh, hand pressed corn tortillas. Though the tacos were a bit on the small side, they were all bursting with flavor and packed with fresh ingredients. I would definitely get the tacos again if I ever happen upon this spot, and perhaps be more adventurous and opt for some of the tacos featuring cactus. Before coming in here, I didn't even know cactus tacos were an option! 

Drinkwise, they offered a wide array of margaritas (apparently they have a Margarita Monday where margaritas are half off) along with your typical standard Mexican brews and a smattering of wines. 

If you find yourself in the downtown Scottsdale area, give Barrio Queen a try!
