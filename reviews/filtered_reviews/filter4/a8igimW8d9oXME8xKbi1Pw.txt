This place has good authentic Mexican food. I have been to this location and the Original Lindo on the other side of town. 

The comes with complimentary chips, salsa, and beans. The salsa has some kick to it. It's not my favorite type of salsa but it still good. 

To drink I got the horchata. I love me some of that. It was a little bit watery for my liking but still refreshing. They were quick to refill my glass though which is always good. 

 I like to get their table side guacamole. It's fresh and delicious. If you like salt you will need to add some but I'm glad they don't over salt it.

This time I got the Chicken Flautas on flour tortillas. They give you 6 which is more than enough. They also come with a side of rice and beans. The rice and beans were alright. I have had better. 

 The service is usually excellent at both places. I give it a 4 because of the salsa. I love chips and salsa but this one doesn't make me want more.
