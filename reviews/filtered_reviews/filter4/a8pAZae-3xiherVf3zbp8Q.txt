Great place to grab some beers and a big platter of nachos. Good for gobbling up yourself or sharing with a group of friends. Nachos are delish and finger licking good. 
Also grab some street tacos off the appetizer menu. Small snack size tacos. Pick any meat to be served in two thin corn tortillas. The chicken meat was perfectly grilled and slightly burnt which gave the perfect amount of crunch. Yum!

This located is located a little turn off Fremont street. A great stop to cool off from the Vegas heat with some cocktails and munchies!!
