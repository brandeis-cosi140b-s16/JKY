We stopped at this location after seeing a commercial & figured, "Why not?" When has t.v ever lied to us before? ;)

This location is straight up a taco stop. Open 24/7 I ordered chorizo (pork sausage) with egg, rice, beans, & tortillas with a delish orange fanta (soda). My people ordered the asada tacos and asada burrito. Four people ate for $20! That's what I'm saying. The portions were good and we didn't feel like we got jipt. The salsa bar offers cebollitas, cucumbers,  jalapenos,  limes, and salsa of course. 

The location was clean, the food was all good. Seasoned just right and flavorful. This little spot had a steady stream of customers walking up and drive through. Will come back when we are back in town. The food plus price was perfect. 

PLUS THE BATHROOM WAS CLEAN.
