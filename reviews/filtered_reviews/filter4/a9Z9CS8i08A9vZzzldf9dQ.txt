This place is exactly what I like in a Mexican restaurant.  The menu has everything you would expect to find, executed well, in an unpretentious atmosphere.  It's also missing everything I don't want in a Mexican restaurant, namely a giant corporation/theme park vibe with sterilized Mexican dishes to suit bland American palates.
