This was my first time here, with a MeetUp lunch group of 8.  They were gonna seat us inside, which was really really dark and dingy, seems like you can't read the menu.  Today was such a beautiful day to sit in the back patio, where they had heaters, and shade and trees, so they kindly set us up a table in the back outdoors.  We so enjoyed it there.

The food was true to the reviews here, which was "really expensive", but really "tasty".  I am not sure I would return to pay so much for so little.  One Yelper said the tacos tortilla was only 3.75" , I was laughing that he measured them, said tiny tortilla wasn't big enough to lift the filling to your mouth.   When I asked the waitress if they were indeed only 3.75" in diameter, she said "No, they are only 3 inches".   I was amused, not sure if she was being facetious, but when they arrived, they looked 3 inches to ME.   3 tiny "tacos" for $10-$12 depending on filling, no garnishes to even eat, nothing else but those 3 tiny tacos. 

We agonized for so long over spending $6 for chips and salsa (cos it is free at other restaurants), and how many ways we were going to split the $6, that the restaurant gave us 3 orders worth $18, gratis, to our table.  

I ate pork shoulder tacos for $10.  It was really delicious!  Every bite of other people's orders was delicious too, but when we shared a bite, we were giving away a substantial portion of our lunch, because the portions were so tiny.

The lunch menu was pretty limited in choices.  I did not see the dinner menu.  

This day was our server's second day working here, but she did a great job, and was good at pouring us water, after all one particular hot sauce used to make the guacomole, if you wanted it extra hot, was making one person's face all read and teary.  

I was hungry when I got home, and ate another lunch from my fridge.
