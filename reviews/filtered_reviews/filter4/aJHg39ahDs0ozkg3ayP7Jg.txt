This place is amazing! It's got great Authentic Mexican food that never disappoints. However, their customer service is not that great. After the person in front me ordered their, I was waiting to be called up. The girl at the register made eye contact then looked back down. So, I just approached the register and while she was taking my order she was chatting with another co-worker and doing something on her phone. If it wasn't for the food I wouldn't go back.
