I  go aleast twice a week. This place is good if you like american  mexican food. 
I like plan white rice or plan brown rice with out any wierd stuff in it. Its a secret menu item. If you ask they can give you these items.

I usually get the steak burrtio with plan white rice, vegs,1/2 black beans, 1/2 pinto beans, cheese, and a coke zero. 
The only thing I dont like is the wierd music and it overall great food.
