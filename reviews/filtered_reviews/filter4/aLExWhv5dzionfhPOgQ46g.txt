I have a confession to make. 

I am... A hipster. It's happened. And ya know what? I'm okay with it. 

We came here last night in search of PBRs and live music. We got that. And so much more. As we're standing there sipping our Champagne of Beers and someone says:

"Damn, that's a really good Jimmy Eat World cover band playing."

And then someone else says:

"Wait a second! That IS Jimmy Eat World!"

So awesome. So 2001.

The atmosphere of this place is great. You have a big outdoor area with space heaters for the cancer lovers, a nice sized front area for the boozers with high top tables and low tables, also plenty of room to stand and chill. The music venue is spacious and well amped. 

Apparently the food is great, I would definitely give it a try next time.

One star off for the minimal bathrooms. There was always a huge line.
