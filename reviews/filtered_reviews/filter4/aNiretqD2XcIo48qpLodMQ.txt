Stopped in for lunch today. Not my first trip and will not be the last. The place is warm and cozy with a cantina feel. 
They start by bringing out chips with refried beans and salsa to start.
I had the Chille Rellanos with Chicken with comes with beans and rice as most entres do. Very good, had just enough heat to make you feel warm after coming in from an ugly rainy day. I was with some other co workers who all enjoyed their meals.
Last several times there i had the fish tacos and almost ordered them again but decided it was time to try something better..good choice..: )
They do offer lunch specials which is a plus
Staff was on point and quick with several refills of our beverages
