Been going here since they first opened up and so far we have always had good service and great food.  We try to get there for Happy Hour and enjoy their 2 for 1 Enchanted Margaritas, of course they have a huge tequila selection to try. The owner always takes a minute to greet us and then will follow up to ask us how the food was.  Their Adovada Pork is seasoned and spiced just right and those Pork Carnitas on the bone ares always tender and taste wonderful!
