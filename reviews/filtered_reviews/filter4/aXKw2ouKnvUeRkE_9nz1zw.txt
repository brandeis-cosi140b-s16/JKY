My first time here, we showed up with a group of 12 people on a Saturday night and almost got laughed out of the place but all with a great sense of humor. They set up a place for us outside, which was mighty kind of them, and we had a wonderful evening.
I hate to give a review based on one evening and I definitely plan to come back soon and really experience the place.
From a "first look" perspective-the food is fresh and interesting-loved the complimentary smoky salsa-I had bites of several kinds of tacos and enjoyed all of them. The Blood Orange Margarita is tasty but like others have commented-it's a wee bit of drink for the price. 
I get the concept and I love it-fabulous ambience-fresh ingredients-unusual flavor profiles, clearly not Rubios-this is a destination place. But, that being said, Arizonians are used to great Mexican that doesn't bust the wallet. 
I'll be back for a second look!
