I came here for my birthday dinner while staying at the Silverton. My main goal was to enjoy a few margaritas. We decided on a pitcher of margaritas and I am glad we did. The complimentary salsa and chips came out quickly. Our service was friendly and adequate- they were very busy with a loud crowd of people but were able to handle the small tables of customers as well. Dinner was hot, flavorful, and made to order. I loved to atmosphere and the decor. I could have done without the TVs but I know that a lot of people want to be up to date with the scores. Good place for a large group or a romantic date.
