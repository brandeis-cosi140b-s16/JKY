This was an accidental find.  It's a nice little place.  The place gives off a comfortable laid back vibe and the tacos are such that you have to savor each and every bite.

Service was friendly and prompt.

The bar is a small but ample selection of wine, tequila mixed drinks, and bottled beer.  All were excellent selections.

We will definitely be back.
