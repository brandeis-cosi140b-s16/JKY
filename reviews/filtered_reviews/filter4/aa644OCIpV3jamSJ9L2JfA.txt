Love. I went for lunch this weekend, and the food was fantastic. I had the grilled chicken baja tacos, and I thought they were perfect. The soft taco shells were just a little grilled and warm, the chicken was great, and their cabo sauce or whatever made the dish. My only dislike about this place was their salsa. Way too much corn. I used to love to drink here, now I'm happy to know their food is good too.
