Ok so before I moved to Tempe I had seen this place on the ever so awesome show Man Vs Food as well as America's best sandwiches. Of course I had to go here and try it right?! When we sat down and got the menu I saw that this place was more than just Tortas (Mexican style sandwiches). They had a very extensive menu. Oh man what the heck was I going to order with so many choices. I'm not a decisive person so when i get a huge menu it makes it really hard on me. Ugghhh! But wait this place has Torta in their name and every time I had seen them on TV it was a Torta the foodie celeb was eating so that was what I would order as well! I wasnt about to try the Man vs Food Torta called the Torta King Carlos V priced at over $20, but this is because it can feed a small village. Nope not for me. I would instead choose the other sandwich which came out in America's best sandwich list...the Torta Del Rey. The sandwich consisted of the following: Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, omelet, sausage and Mexican sausage come with tomato, onions, avocado, chipotle sauce, smear of refried beans and potatoes ruffles on the side. That sounds like a lot yumminess in between 2 pieces of bread. Wait how do they even fit all of that in a sandwich? They're joking right...Not at all! This thing is huge and just under $10...oh my! Whoever thought of this is a genius cause it tasted amazing! The only downfall is the thing is huge and hard to keep together. Gets quite messy for sure, but the experience is pleasurable throughout. Last of all the service was incredible. The host and waitresses would promptly come around frequently always making sure we were content. I would definitely return here and suggest anyone else do the same...just make sure you are feeling hungry!
