When someone mentions Mexican for lunch, I just figure it's gonna be another 'berto's, but not this time!
Popo's is NOT easy to find and I almost drove right by it. It's in a little strip mall on the north side of Indian School. I didn't realize there was parking in back, but there are a few in front and I was lucky enough to find one. 
We got a HUGE booth! The whole place is pretty spacious and the seating is super comfy. I always ask for a booth. I don't know why, but I love a booth.
I had a combo of a chili relleno, enchilada and rice and beans. Everything was fresh, if a little greasy. There was a puddle of grease under my rice, but I didn't care much because I was eating Mexican food. We got chips and salsa right as we were seated. Service was quick during out entire meal. We ended up staying after our server left (it was one of those lunch meetings with 4 people who like to talk a LOT and we had to get our tab and pay so our server could leave) and nobody gave us any hassle for staying a couple hours.
I really liked the bathrooms! Super clean, without that damn southwest decor. I reallllllllly hate kokopellis and cacti and whatever else makes up the southwest theme. Hate. Blech!
The prices were a couple dollars higher than what you'd normally see, but it was fine since the quality of food was really good. 
Oh, and I was speaking Spanish to the hostess but apparently she didn't speak it. Whoopsie!
