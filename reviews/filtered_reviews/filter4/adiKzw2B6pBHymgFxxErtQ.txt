Lady who sat me at the bar for my take out placing was nice. Another lady swung by giving me a water and chips and salsa! I said oh, I'm ordering to go. She's like, I know. And I'm like, oh.

LoL okay. Chips and salsa are my favorite food so that was nice. The guy who took my order....I saw the face you made as you walked away.  -_-

Nachos: Asked chicken or carnitas, he suggested half and half.  Okay. Chicken was delicious, dug out the carnitas after two bites, didn't care for it. Suggestion, don't add the meat, doesn't need it. 

Mexican Corn: Do It!!!!

Mo's dessert: Saved for later and was okay. Mayhap better eaten right away...

FYI, to go order I got chips and salsa. If I had known that, I wouldn't have ordered the nachos. Ate these the next day, chips started to go stale but the salsa was better cold. I'm not a fan of the dark red salsa. But yum!!

Side note : the chips and salsa young lady was super nice while I waited. We bonded over yoga, recommended the Bikram Yoga Phoenix down the street. Welcome to Phoenix Alaska girl. :)
