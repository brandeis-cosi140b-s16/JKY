Padre's is a nice little Mexican place that has it's own spin on Mexican food.  It's not the standard fare that you will encounter at Macayo's or Manuel's.

Fresh food and a great menu. The entrees are delicious.  I like the Padre's is a small place that has it's own charm.  There is a big bar area and dining as well.

I won't write too much more, so you'll be able to experience Padre's for yourself.  Enjoy!
