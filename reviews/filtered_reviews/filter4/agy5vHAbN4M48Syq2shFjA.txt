Been here so many times. They have a great Happy Hour and the appetizers are CHEAP! Super great drinks. They have a Birthday club you can join so you get a free dinner for your BDay..you can order the fajita dinner! Such a good deal!
They make fresh tableside guacamole and its very good. I have been sitting at the bar lately..gotta get to know your bartender! 2 margaritas & nachos and this mommy is ready for a nap!
Best place to eat in mall for sure!
