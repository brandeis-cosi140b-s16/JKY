This place is rather difficult to find if you start in Caesar's, but if you come into the Forum through the door in front of the fountain off the strip, it's right there. All of their food is responsibly grown, treated, cultivated etc. The chips and salsa was immaculate and the guac was even better. I'm not really one for latin food so my enchiladas weren't my favorite, but I could tell it was very well made and would be enjoyable to anyone who likes latin food. Overall it was a great experience. The waitress was great and so was the service. It was also basically empty from about 5-7pm on a Sunday evening on spring break if I remember correctly. One small thing, the batch of sangria that we had was actually rather bitter, which was really the point being that it was border grill's take on the sangria recipe, so if you're looking for sweet sangria be cautious. It was also a bit noisy on the patio because of the acoustics in the atrium. Other than that it was a great experience and they even really encouraged us to leave feedback after we left. It really showed me that they cared a lot about their quality of service.
