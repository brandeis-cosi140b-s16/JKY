I've been to a ton of Mexican joints around town. Many times, I've discovered that it's hard to escape the generic expected tastes that they tend to offer. Casa Don Juan seems to escape that trend by incorporating fresh, homemade flavors that I was able to see and taste. 

Almost immediately after sitting, we were greeted with chips and salsa. Salsa was great, same with the bean dip. I ended up ordering a side of guacamole with the chips, because of the rave Yelps about it. And yes, I'll have to stand by those reviews, because I absolutely loved the guac.

Entrees did not absolutely blow my mind, but they were still very good. The chicken entrees seem to be a bit lackluster, but the beef dishes seem to be more memorable:

-Bistec de pollo: a very basic grilled chicken breast dish. I would avoid. Almost seems like something I could make at home
-Carne Asada taco: delicious, juicy and flavorful pieces of meat. The homemade tortilla goes with this very well. I was a little surprised that nothing else came with the taco. It was just a tortilla filled with meat, with a side of lemon. The carne asada didn't joke around. One bite was both juicy and flavorful. My next visit is going to have to focus on this.
-Chicken mole: much better tasting chicken than the bistec de pollo. I'm thinking it's the sauce that saved it.

To end it all, we finished it off with fried ice cream (see picture). Here it's served a little different than I'm used to. Instead of a simple corn flake coating, they add Fruity Pebbles as well. If you're not a fan of the Fruity Pebble taste, maybe you should avoid this. I personally loved it.

All in all, the tortillas and guacamole were some of the best that I've had in Vegas. Friendly service and lively atmosphere were also a plus. Chicken entrees come off a little weak, but the carne asada is sure to impress. If you see me back here, my table will be dedicated exclusively to the cow and whatever it has to offer.
