We hadn't  been to Arizona in years, so we were initially itching for Mexican food, but Blue Adobe turned out to be relatively near where we were staying and had some great reviews on Yelp, so we went. It was absolutely fantastic. However, it's not for everyone. We did not find it to be especially hot-spicy, but chili powder is in a lot. The salsa that comes with the chips is rich, thick and flavorful, but if you really, really like the tomato-centric salsa of the typical Mexican or Tex-Mex place, you might not like this dark, smoky salsa. I had a special, halibut rubbed in ancho chile spices with a shrimp enchilada. The fish was dry -- a big hazard for fish -- but good. The enchilada was out of this world. The rice was very good, though I hit a lumpy pocket of spice that hadn't dispersed in the pot. There was so much on the menu we would want to try, if we stayed in the Mesa area for a week we could come in every night and keep trying different things.
