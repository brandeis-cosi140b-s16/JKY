This little eatery is a great find for those who want to enjoy non-chain restaurant. 

The service was fast and accurate. The menu was moderately priced. And the options were decent enough to allow an experienced foodie to try something different. 

The best part about this cocina is the quality. The food tasted fresh and tasty. I ordered the Chicken Mole Enchilada...it was delightful. I could taste the sweetness of the chocolate, the delicate bitterness of coffee, and a finish of light smoke. Looking forward to trying the fajitas next time.
