This place is hard to find tucked away in commercial pad with Urgent Care, Insurance Co and a school.  We came because of a Groupon and we heard from several foodie friends this place was very good. 

We came on a Wednesday evening and at first there were not very many customers even though they had happy hour until 6pm.  We got a table right away and the service was extremely slow.  We had we think a new server......although he was super nice he was a little unorganized and it took forever to get our drinks, order our food and get our food.  Once we got our food it was all excellent.  The green chili everything was excellent, the adovada burrito was delicious and even better the next day as left overs.  We really, really love New Mexican style and everything was absolutely delicious.  

If you are in the area...this is must try.  Hopefully, you will get better service but it was definitely worth the wait.
