One of my favorite weekend lunches when I want to stuff myself for under 10 bucks. I usually get jade red (fried orange chicken with spice) and machaca (shredded beef with spices) or the pollo diablo (not batterred but lightly fried chicken with spices) all the fried rices are about the same the jerk chicken and jerk rice use black pepper as oppossed to chili for the spice. You get a nice doughy cookie as well for about 8.50
