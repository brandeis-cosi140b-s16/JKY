Mmmmmmmmmm. So many good things to say about this place. The staff is friendly and extremely attentive, the ambiance is relaxed, the menu offers plenty of choices, the portions are filling, and the price is just right. The only thing I dislike about Mi Patio is that the cups they use for the Margaritas are so deceiving! You THINK you are getting a lot, but in actually the cups don't hold a whole lot. Guess I can't complain too much about a $1.75 cold Margarita, though! This place is great for Happy Hour or a quick lunch. If it wasn't 2 in the morning I'd run there right now for chips and salsa and some tasty shredded beef tacos.
