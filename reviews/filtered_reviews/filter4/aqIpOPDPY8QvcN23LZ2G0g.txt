New restuarant and a welcome addition to the South Side neighborhood. My wife and I enjoyed their fajitas and enchiladas.  The Mexican beer selection was great.  The service was prompt and the atmosphere was good for conversation.  We were there on a weeknight which never seems to be too crowded here.  This is a quality joint that I would recommend to anyone.
