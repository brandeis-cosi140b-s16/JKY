Great concert venue ... smallish, bordering on intimate, but they draw in a lot of great bands.  The food's great too.  Pretty much typical Southwestern/bar fare.  Great nachos and burritos, and their Sonoran dog uses a Schreiner's dog and an awesome roll. Overall, if you haven't been here you should definitely stop in for a show or at least a good meal and some drinks!
