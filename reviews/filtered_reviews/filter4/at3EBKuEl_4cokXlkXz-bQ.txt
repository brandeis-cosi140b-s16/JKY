It's always a good sign to see a line at a lunch spot. Tacos were pretty good, my least favorite of the ones I tried was the fish, not that is it wasnt good, just that there are others I prefer. Beans were just plain ole pinto beans. All in all a good stop with good food and the price is just right for lunch.
