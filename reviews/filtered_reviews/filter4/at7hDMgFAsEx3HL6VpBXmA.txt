When it comes to Tue nights and your looking for some cheep eats with a cold beer, Steel Catus is where it's at. You have your choice of multiple meats with fresh mixings. I highly recommend you check it out if you're ever in Shadyside on a Tuesday. Just a reminder the kitchen closes at 10 so don't wait to long or your out of taco luck.
