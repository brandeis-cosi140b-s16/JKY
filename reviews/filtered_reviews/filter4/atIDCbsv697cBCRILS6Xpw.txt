Awesome tacos! Even better than Gordos! The extras are free, where normally most taquerias charge extra for, like the beans and the grilled chiles and green onions. They also have awesome fresh jugos (juices) for beverages, salsas, elotes (corn) and I think the tortillas for the tacos asada are home made. I have been here twice already and coming back for more.
There are 3 separate lines for different meats, so make sure to get your tray ready and tips in hand as they will hook it up! The 4th and final line is the check out line to pay for all the grub! 
I would have given them 5 stars if it weren't for my favorite taqueria back home, "La Pasadita" in Chicago IL.
