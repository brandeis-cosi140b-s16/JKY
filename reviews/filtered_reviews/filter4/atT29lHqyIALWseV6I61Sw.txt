Finally got over to this place! It's a bit hidden in a tiny strip mall type building but easy enough to find. The food was very good, no complaints at all. I tried the tacos (one of each) and two burritos, one regular and one fusion. I prefered the regular burrito to the fusion one, it seemed to have a bit more flavor. I prefer the burritos at Cafe Rio, these are about the same size (huge) but not quite as good. 

The standout was the tacos, spefically the beef ones, these are what is gonna get me back there. The flavor was excellent and the price is right! Worth checking out for sure!
