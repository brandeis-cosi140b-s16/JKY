This review may be a lil overdue, because my boyfriend and I have visited Chayo quite a few times now.  Each time we have had a great experience.  We enjoy the location, atmosphere, and of course the food each time we visit!

We LOVE the carnitas tacos! You have to try these.... they are great! There is just something about the mix of flavors and textures that makes these tacos a must have!  We order them every time we visit!

I would also highly recommend trying the sweet corn enchiladas!

Try to sit in the bar area that is open to the outside- great people watching!
