Loved it. My husband wasn't so impressed at first because it was dark, trendy, and packed.  He is was pleasantly surprised at the great food!  The server calmed him down and was very attentive to his discomfort. We had steak tacos and pumpkin bread pudding. I love that kind of atmosphere and my husband...well he doesn't like to to go out of his comfort zone,  and I loved it!!
