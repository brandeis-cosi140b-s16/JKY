I've been here twice for work sponsored happy hours, which means I've never paid, which naturally raises my rating by a star. Anything free is always better, right?

That said, I like this location. Service is attentive enough, food is OK, and the outdoor area with all the sand (get it? SANDbar...) is really cool. They've got heaters for the winter and misters for the summer, as well as big fans to keep the air circulating. Drink specials are good during happy hour, and there are some food specials as well. 

Saw a coworker accidentally walk into the wading pool, and ended up soaked to the thighs...That was pretty funny. 

Sandbar is a good place to come get drinks if you're in Chandler, sit outside if it's not too brutal, it's a much more fun experience than being inside.
