First the great review. My second visit here and this one the food was awesome. We had chips and guacamole which was tasty and well made.
We had shrimp tacos and yucatan pork tacos both on corn. The shrimp had a nice smoky flavor with some heat and fruit flavor, the pork tacos were cooked well and I could have eaten them all day.  But the tacos are small and loaded with taste so you leave feeling sated by taste but not in pain form over eating.

Now the bad. As we sat on the balcony a large loud group of hotel media people crowded onto the balcony all around our table talking about lining up shots and ignoring all the customers. Not a warning from the restaurant management or apology from the rude camera crew and snotty on camera people.
