I was only here for drinks, but wow!  I don't even know what this drink was called- it was some sort of fruity margarita that came with a coconut popcicle.  A messy drink, to be sure, but delicious!  The outdoor seating area is beautiful on a nice night, and the service was great as well.  I'm looking forward to returning and trying the food!
