My son and I were making a u-turn and discovered this place. What a delight. My son got the make it a burrito with chicken and I got a bowl with chicken. I could not eat everything in my bowl and my son, who is a 20 year old decathlete and eats for 6, had to pace his eating to finish it. I have no complaints about the service either. I pulled up, ordered my food and left. The young lady at the window was polite and smiled....don't know what else she needed to do ? So, I don't get the people complaining about not getting Ruth's Chris service at a drive through window. Will definitely be eating here again.
