I actually wrote up this place in my FoodBurgh blog

Here are some snippets...

Formerly the Iguana Grill, the restaurant that is now Yo Rita never used to serve up much in the way of quality Mexican food. At least, that's what the reviews seem to say; I never went. More than a year ago, that changed: they brought in Kevin Sousa, who you might call one of Pittsburgh's "celebrity chefs." He completely redesigned the menu and, by all accounts, really turned the place into something noteworthy.

Having now been to Yo Rita, can report that I really like what Sousa did. [...] Beyond the somewhat distracting logo, Yo Rita nails just about every attribute I look for in a restaurant: welcoming atmosphere, pleasant waitstaff, a menu I don't feel guilty about, and (most importantly) exceptionally prepared and presented food. On that basis, it easily makes my list of must-visit Pittsburgh establishments. It's one of those places everyone should try at least once.
