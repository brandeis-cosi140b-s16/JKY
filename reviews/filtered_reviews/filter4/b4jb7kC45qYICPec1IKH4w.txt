Number 18 baby! 2 carne asada burritos with rice and beans! Me and the Mr will share that plus a cheese quesadilla.. super friendly drive thru service on the cheap! Many notches above your standard 'Berto's fare.. here the ingredients seem of better quality plus my ass doesn't hurt the next day! Can't go wrong here!
