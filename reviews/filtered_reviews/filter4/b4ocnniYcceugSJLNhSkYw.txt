The service was great and fast! The chips brought out were of great quality, none of that store bought tortilla chips I see all the time! Four dips including salsa were also free. 
I ordered the chicken fajita plate thinking it was a little pricey, but nope! I got so much food with it I asked for a box right when the waitress set the food down. Chicken was good, veggies were awesome and the tortillas served were warm. Only thing I wish was that I got a little more variety of veggies, I only saw bell peppers and onion. 
I didn't get the sopapilla dish but the table next to ours did and DAMN did it look good!! Can't wait to try it.
