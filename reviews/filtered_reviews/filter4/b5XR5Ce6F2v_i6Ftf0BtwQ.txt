When you walk into an establishment and George Clinton is playing, you know it's going to be an interesting experience. After four years in this city I finally decided to give it a shot thanks to a coupon for a free entree + drink. I've always been curious about this place with it's eccentric outside decor, bars on the windows plus I like with things starting with F but are spelled out PH (however I hate when things that start with C are spelled out with a K but that's besides the point). I went right after work and there were only two other people in there....unheard of! Part of the reason I've never been is because the parking lot is full and I can't find anywhere to park so I was pleased to know I would finally get my Phat on. Even though the smell of Price's was in the air, I was still ready to try PB.

I got a chicken burrito to go and it was ready in less than 5 mins. It seemed like there were two people working that shift so I was surprised with the turn around time. When I got home and sat down to eat, I unwrapped the foil around the burrito and holy crap---it was bigger than my dogs head (see pics)! Boo ya! Super tasty and I didn't have to add any salsa or hot sauce. It was perfect just the way it was. It wasn't too dry but at the same time wasn't sopping wet and falling apart. For Mexican in a pinch, this will be my new go to spot....but only if I can find a parking spot.
