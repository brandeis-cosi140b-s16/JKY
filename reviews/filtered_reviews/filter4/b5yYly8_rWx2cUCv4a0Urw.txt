What's not to like about a restaurant named Pink Taco! Well, during my stay in Vegas, I really wanted some Mexican food, and my local friend took us here.  I wasn't expecting authentic Mexican by ANY means, but this place sure delivered on taste.

First off, they bring out various salsas and chips. All were very delicious and flavorful.  I had the chicken enchiladas for my entree. Not much to say but it was tasty enough that I didn't leave a drop on my plate. That and all the other entrees were fairly reasonable also-$10-12 a pop. However, one thing stands out the most about this place is the oh-so-strong margaritas! I definitely recommend getting them and hey, if you don't finish yours, you can always take it to go! I love Las Vegas liquor laws!

One minus-it's located inside the Hard Rock hotel off the strip, making it difficult to get to without driving to it.
