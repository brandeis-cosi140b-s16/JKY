I come here a few times a month to meet my boyfriend for lunch hour. Food here is absolutely amazing! Very unique, we always get the brussels sprout nachos. I know it sounds weird, try it. 

The service is pretty slow however, if you are on a timeline let the server know right away otherwise it's going to be one long lunch. 

I never noticed the Treat Stand before my last visit. I ordered a $2 ice cream cone with fruity pebbles and received an amazing bucket of ice cream! Im absolutely coming back even if it's just for the treats. For $2 you'll need to share.
