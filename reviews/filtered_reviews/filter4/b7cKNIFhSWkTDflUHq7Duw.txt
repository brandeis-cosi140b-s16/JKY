So I haven't actually been in the grocer.  I was attracted solely for the taco cart that was cooking some wonderfully smelling food out front.  You can choose either flour or corn tortillas -- the flour will take a little longer than the corn -- for your taco and a filling of beef, pork, or sausage.  The taco by itself is nothing special.  The seasonings are rather bland and the tortillas are not homemade.  What really makes these tacos good are the condiments and sauces that are in the cart to the left of the grill.  These sauces are freshly made and wow do they taste good on the tacos.  Be careful, though, I have no discernible heat tolerance limit and so was scooping on the sauces and trying them with a spoon.  Some poor guy after me apparently took some of the habanero sauce after me and his eyes were gushing with tears.  

Hurts so good!
