Miguel's is great.  This may be difficult to locate for people that are randomly looking to stop somewhere, though.  The good is very good tasting tex/mex.  The service is just fine and attentive, I've not experienced any customer service issues here.  They have combos and affordable food if you want something cheap; otherwise there big entrees are good and still not a wallet buster.

I'd recommend this place to anyone on the west side or anyone making the trip South on I-85.
