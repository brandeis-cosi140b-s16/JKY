I was just reading the reviews on Yelp!, and I can't justify the 1 star reviews with the great meal and service I just had.  Everything was super fresh, the al pastor torta and tacos were delish, and I couldn't get over how much shrimp was in the Coctel de Camaron (prolly misspelt :-)  Service was friendly, mostly quick and super knowledgeable.  Also several local Az breweries were represented, and the bar looked pretty well stocked, with some interesting house cocktails.  We tried both desserts (pudding and tort) which just put the meal over the top.  My only complaint, the menu was kind of limited.
