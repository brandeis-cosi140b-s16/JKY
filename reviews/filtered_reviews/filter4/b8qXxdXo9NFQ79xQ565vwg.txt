Ate there yesterday (11/19/12) and had a great lunch after getting confused, direction wise as to its location. It's a couple blocks West of town Junction of Hwy 93 and Hwy 60 in Wickenburg, AZ. I had the #11, three enchiladas: cheese, chicken and shredded beef. Excellent refried beans and rice, chips, two different kinds of salsa and bean dip. Service was super friendly and fast. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in the area!
