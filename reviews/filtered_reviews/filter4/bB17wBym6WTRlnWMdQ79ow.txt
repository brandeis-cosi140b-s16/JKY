Darned good tacos!
I'd heard so much about Taco Tuesday at this place, I had to duck in when I found myself near there. 
Holy Mackeral! 1.50 Tacos? Are you kidding me? ($1.99 normal days). 
I like to honor what the place does on first trial. 
I figured I'd try three tacos; one shredded beef, one shredded pork, and a fish. The souveneir cup seemed like a wise choice for 1.99, with endless refills from the fountain. I was working so no drinky drink, but the college kids seemed to be enjoying all sorts of margies with beers tipped into them and huge frosty schooners of God knows what. I'll have to go back for that. 
The tacos were excellent. I probably liked the beef about the best, with the pork a close second, and there was certainly nothing wrong with the fish taco either. They are served "Baja style", so there's fresh tomato, lettuce, cilantro, and feta cheese, which imitates some of the hard mexican cheeses quite deliciously. I'll come back, often. 
There's 8 or 12 beers on tap, including Corona which you never see. The decor is what you'd expect, multi colored swag in beer themes and school colors so you don't forget you're at ASU, should you have too many frosty margs. 
I wouldn't bring the kids, though you certainly can. The music's loud, the vibe is college, and the beverages are flowing. I'm tickled to have found this place!
