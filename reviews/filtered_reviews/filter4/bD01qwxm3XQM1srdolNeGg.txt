First time here and already it's by far much better than some of the other places I've been to here in Madison.  Instantly greeted, we sat and were served drinks quickly.  The red salsa has a great smoky flavor and kick to it.  Ordered the fish tacos and were really impressed!  No fried undistinguishable fish here...just flavorfuly steamed fish with fresh toppings.  I should mention I moved here from Chicago about 1.5yrs ago and have been sorely disappointed in the Mexican places here, will certainly be back to try the other items on the menu.  The other reviews about the service need to relax, the food is good!
