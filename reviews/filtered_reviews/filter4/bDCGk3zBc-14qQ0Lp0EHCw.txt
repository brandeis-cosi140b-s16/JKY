What a nice time. Scott was an amazing server. 

We started with the pork verde appetizer - slow braised pork chunks in a mild green chili sauce. This was served with a hot cup of perfectly seasoned black beans and warmed tortillas. 

I had the trout for my entr√©e. Wonderful. It  was perfectly cooked and topped with a portion of mango salsa. The vegetable medley was grilled just right bringing out their natural sweetness without being overdone. 

For a cocktail it was the tejas mule - a tequila themed Moscow mule. Refreshing. 

We'll be back.
