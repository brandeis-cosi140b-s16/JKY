Holy Tacos and Salsa Bar!!!!!! This place is the real deal. We came here 10 minutes after opening and we were glad we did. This place filled up quickly and for good reason. The tacos were incredible. The spicy pork, the beef, the white fish all mouth watering. The refried beans and rice served on the side tasted awesome, I just wish the portions were larger. Right away we were served large baskets of warm tortilla chips and we tried every salsa at the bar. Some were very spicy!!!! I enjoyed the cilantro cream one on the fish tacos. The quesadilla came with avocado slices on top and the cheese was very tasty. These tacos were gourmet! I really enjoyed everything we ate here and would definitely come back. Prices are fair as well. They staff kept refilling our glasses of water and kept checking in on us. We had a great lunch here.
