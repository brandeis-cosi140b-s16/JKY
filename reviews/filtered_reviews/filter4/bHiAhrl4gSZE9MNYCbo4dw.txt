This one of our favorite restaurants on the west side of Phoenix.  My wife and I eat here at least once per week.  The service is always consistently good and the food is above average and definitely consistently good.  It is well managed and even though we have to wait periodically, this is because the restaurant is so good.  Everything is good; the daily soups, the variety of entrees including shrimp, steak, chicken and mexican food.  A great value!
