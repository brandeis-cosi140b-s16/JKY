This is our go-to Mexican spot since moving to midtown. There are tons of trendy taco spots, but if you want really delicious traditional Mexican food, Juan's is it. The fresh chips and salsa are delicious and plentiful. I always get the taco and enchilada platter: one of each plus rice and beans. This is one of those places where the sides are actually not a throw away - they are so good! The enchilada sauce is divine, but the tacos just can't be beat. Good service as well. This place is consistently awesome.
