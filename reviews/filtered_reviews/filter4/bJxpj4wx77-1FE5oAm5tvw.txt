Unique tapas style food. The guacamole with the homemade style crispy tortilla rounds is a great way to start. The rockin shrimp was really good. The Sumoritas are delicious and strong as well. We had the Suzuki and Tempura Unagi roll and I have to admit the sushi was my favorite part of the meal. We also got the Korean beef tacos and the spicy tuna tacos. The portions are pretty small so it sounds like a lot more food then it felt like. There are only two small tacos in each order so when you order with another person, keep that in mind. The side of street corn with popcorn on top has great flavors and sauces and is definitely a recommendation. 

Not a place you should go if you're starving and trying to eat a lot without spending a ton of money, but definitely a place with a modern vibe and amazing decor, worth trying in Scottsdale.
