I used to go the the Gonzalez Y Gonzalez back in the actual New York City and have the pozole at least once every 6 weeks. It's unfortunate, but they took it off the menu here. Maybe it's because visitors to Las Vegas who stay at the New York, New York don't "get" what pozole is.

So.
There's tortilla soup instead.

But I'm not sooo disappointed because each time I've come here the staff has been friendly and efficient. The food is basic mexican but it's done consistently well. The tilapia tacos were seasoned enough to please me and also my 2 year old. The enchiladas and tacos were simple and tasty. Chips were light and the salsa smokey and spicy.

It's kid friendly and good for big groups. You're not going to get anything out of the ordinary here but you don't have to leave the Strip to get decent Mexican food.
