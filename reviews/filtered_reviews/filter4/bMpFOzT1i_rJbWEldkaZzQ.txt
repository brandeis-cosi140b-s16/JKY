After a coworker recommended this place I decided to give it a try while I was in town.    When I arrived I was promptly greeted at the door.  I decided to sit at the bar since I was eating by myself and the place was pretty empty.  It is a nice little place with a metal top bar.

First they brought me chips and salsa.  The salsa was awesome.  It was packed with flavor and a little heat.  I decided to order the red chile enchiladas with pork.  It was absolutely delicious. The staff were very friendly and attentive. I wish we had  real Mexican food like this in the Midwest.  

They also have authentic Mexican beers on tap.  While I didn't have any on this visit the selection looked pretty good.  

I wish I had known about this place before.  I  had great food and a great experience.  I will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.
