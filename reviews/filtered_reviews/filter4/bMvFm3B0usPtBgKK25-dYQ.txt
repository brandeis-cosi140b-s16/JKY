Totally dig this place! Had the Bombay taco which I would give a solid 5 stars, the carne asada another 5 stars, and the shanghai which wasnt for me but I would still give it a 3 star rating. Had a HUGE beer menu and tequila menu, its a whole page written in the tiniest font thats how many they have. They even have a beer pairing menu to go with your tacos. It's great, go there and eat for sure.
