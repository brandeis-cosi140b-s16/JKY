Great pork tamales, and if you haven't yet, try the huaraches. Seating is good for couples and small 4-6 groups. It's definitely a lot quieter and quicker service around 8:30/9pm past the dinner rush. But service in general is good.

My only reservation is that TWICE now I've found hairs (embedded/baked in) inside my pork tamales. This is over several visits so it's not a very common occurrence. But 2 times is probably 2 too many.

My rating is a testament to the food quality aside from the occasional hair. Worth a try for more genuine Mexican cuisine.
