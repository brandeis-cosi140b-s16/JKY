I've been going to Lulu's since I was probably 5 years old, my dad used to take me when all I cared about were bean burritos. 18 years later I can still say Lulu's is one of the best Mexican food places I've ever been.

I agree with a lot of what has already been said: chips and salsa are not free which is a total bust, some of the stuff is WAY overpriced, and... can we talk about the price of refills?? $0.79 no matter what size soda you bought? I definitely got screwed on that one by buying a small soda thinking I would get free refills...

It IS a hole in the wall. It's a great summer lunch place or an early dinner after a long day at the pool. Everything I've had: carne asada, bean burro, the salsa, they are all good. Just pricey. How did I pay $9 for a drink, a bean burrito, a street taco and some chips?? I will never know. Yelp is wrong, I feel like $10 and under should not be considered cheap per person, but that's what I have to put since all the entrees are about $10. But it was really, really good. I would rather pay like $7.50 but I don't eat there every day and I understand there must be some underlying cost we aren't aware of.

Oh, and they have CRUSHED ICE!! (The good kind like at Sonic) So I'm sold.

Thanks Lulu!
