This was our first time here and we have been wanting to try it for a while. We went for lunch with boyfriend and his mom and it was the perfect time to go. Dinner looked really good but pricey. 

I had a flat bread with a quesadilla to start. The guac was good and so was the quesadilla but not sure how you could mess those up anyway. The flat bread I had was just the cheese one and it was tasty. I love arugula on my pizzas so this was a good combo. The cheese was sweet to me at first but I brought the leftovers home and it didn't taste as sweet later on.

Boyfriend had some dish that was eggs with a yummy bean puree and he loved it. Mom had a flat bread as well and it had I think chicken and pineapple and other yummies on top. 

I had a mimosa with lunch but it was tiny and didn't have enough champagne in it so I was a little mad about that. 

I would go there again and probably try to go during happy hour since that menu looked good.  I don't think I would want to come here for a regular dinner just because of the prices unless it was a legit date night and we had the extra cash.

The patio is really cool but it kind of sucks cause you're right on the main road and get a lot of traffic sounds.
