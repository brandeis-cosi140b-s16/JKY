I've been coming to Pink Taco for years.  So it's not authentic Mexican food, but it's still a fun time.  Oh, and their queso is DA BOMB.

Before I became a vegetarian, I used to order the shrimp tacos (yum).  Now that I'm vegetarian, I switch between veggie burritos, quesadillas, and enchiladas.  Everything I get is fresh and flavorful and huge.

What do I always get when I'm at Pink Taco?  The queso dip and the fried ice cream.  The queso is a huge bowl of gooey cheese that always leaves a smile on my face.  The fried ice cream has just enough crunch per ice cream bite, and is topped with a little bit of liqueur to make things interesting.

*Side note to vegetarians: although we had asked in the past, it wasn't until recently a server told us that some of the sauces (not all) and the rice are made with chicken stock.  Make sure to ask questions before you order anything, and if you're really worried about it have them ask the kitchen or a manager.


Besides the good food, I think what really keeps me coming back here is the atmosphere.  Top to bottom is decorated with Dia de los Muertos skeletons, luchador movie posters, and even a pimped out bike or two.  The music is just one great song after another (probably Hard Rock's doing, I'm sure) and the servers are always on top of things.  We have brought several friends who were visiting town and they've all enjoyed themselves as well.

A little pricier than I like to pay for a burrito, but not bad for The Strip.  Don't come on Sundays unless you like fighting the crowds of drunk, sunburnt college kids partying at Rehab.

To Pink Taco: what's happened to your salsas?  They used to be so good now they are falling by the wayside.  It makes me sad.
