I am editing my initial review and adding a star.  The reason being I think I posted my first draft in a "Scottsdale Douchey" tone that is not my style. 

Also I think I neglected to point out the highlights.  

But also have you ever seen a movie that you didn't think much of when you left
the theatre but a week later realized it was better than you thought.  

So here's the good:  Mojito thing was crazy good.  Mushroom tacos where amazing.  Service was excellent.  The mango habanero sauce they leave on tables I practically drank (should bottle that stuff up). 

The bad:  I was disappointed in the guacamole but now I realize it was just guacamole. I mean how good or different could it be.  Also the mole wasn't as saucy as I'd like and the plantains were indistinguishable from the chicken which was dry. 

The ugly:   The tres leche dessert was a disaster.  Not a good note to finish on. I've heard others claim it was great so maybe we had an off batch.  

The decor is great though acoustics are bad but that wasn't a bad thing as it gave the space energy.  

We also ordered sushi and I think it was pricey for what it was and while it wasn't bad, it also didn't blow mind. 

I think for sure we need to go back and explore other options on the menu.  

Perhaps the most constructive critique I could give would be to simplify the menu and offer fewer choices, but put more heart and soul into every item
