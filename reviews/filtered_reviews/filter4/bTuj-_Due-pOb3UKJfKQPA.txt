We are relatively new to the area and had yet to find a good Mexican restaurant- until a friend pointed us to Viva Mercados.
The food was absolutely delicious and the portions were very generous. I had enough fajita left over for lunch the next day.  And the margaritas! Hmmm...what can I say about those? Divine. Wonderful. And best of all- they definitely aren't cheap with the Tequila!
