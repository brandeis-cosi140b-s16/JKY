Nice hidden gem of a Mexican restaurant that does a great job of creating unique southwestern creations that you won't find in a typical Mexican restaurant.  Our food was surprisingly unique and tasty...koodos to the chef and owner.  However, the wait staff needs some improvement....kind of too casual, uncaring, offered few suggestions...but one person was working the entire restaurant...which had about 10 tables busy.  The chips were stale.  The place has a unique atmosphere, almost Moroccan with dim lighting and pillows in every booth.   We'll probably be back after looking around some more.  We were given a menu with no pricing, and after asking about it, we got the one with pricing.  Weird.  Nice bar with sports on TV also away from the dining booths.  Good chill music playing with Dave Mathews and Coldplay.
