We dined here not knowing it was Taco Tuesday and boy, we were glad we did!! We ordered the guacamole, 6 different tacos, the carne asada burrito, a carne asada kids meal, as well as a pitcher of the white sangria. Everything was delicious!!! As for the restaurant itself and the service, we dined outside since the cool misters truly made dining outside a pleasure. Service was great too, especially since they treated our 21 month old son so well!!!
