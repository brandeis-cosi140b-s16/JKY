Came here on Sunday during some big football game going on so it was pretty busy!   Our waiter was very nice, and we didnt wait at all for a table.  I ordered the drunken chicken nachos...they were Sooooooooooo good!! Probably the best nachos Ive ever had!!  Before the nachos we had a small bowl of tortilla soup...the presentation of it was awesome!  They bring out the shredded chicken and tortilla strips on a plate, then the waiter comes over and pours the broth over it in front of you!!  Sooo cool, and it was very yummy!!  Service was a little slow at times, but uderstandable because it looked like each waiter had to cover a lot more tables than normal.  All in all I cant wait to go back and have the nachos again!!
