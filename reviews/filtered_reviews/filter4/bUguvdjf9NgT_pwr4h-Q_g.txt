Went here on a Saturday it was pretty full, so we took a seat at the bar. We were quickly approached by the bartender, she was very knowledgable about the tequila and various other spirits. Her recommendations on he tequila she served us were right in the money. As for the food, we tried several different tacos pork, short rib, lobster, fish. They were small but very tasty. We also enjoyed the fish and chips as well as her recommendations of some shumai with quail egg on it. They were really really good. I love andres, and before you go in there, as a diner should always have an idea if what you're gonna pay; to me it was just about right.  The fusion of Asian and Spanish inspired dishes is interesting and something you don't see everywhere. Of course I wish portions were bigger, but there is a lot of detail placed in these small plates. I would recommend everyone go to a Jose andres restaurant at some point in their lives.
