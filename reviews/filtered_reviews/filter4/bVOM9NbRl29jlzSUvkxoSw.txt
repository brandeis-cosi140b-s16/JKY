I was in Charlotte last week with my wife on business so we stopped by this place I had bookmarked in Yelp that I was anxious to try.  

When we first drove by (had to do a U-Turn) it appeared they were closed as I didn't see anyone in the parking lot.  Once we got there the parking lot was definitely empty but the sign said open.  Once we arrived inside this local place I was impressed with the customer service we received.  These people are very friendly and we had the pleasure to get to know the manger on duty Issac.  Such as great guy and was really interested in hearing about our experience as well as information regarding Yelp.  We probably had a 10 min conversation discussing YELP alone which we always are gratefully to give our experiences since we have the BEST YELP ambassador in Asheville (Kipper !!!!)

Onto the meal as that is what you want to hear about right?

My wife was looking for a Gluten Free (GF) meal but had nothing on the board labeled as such...BUT they accommodated her by making her a bowl with the ingredients she chose.  This made her very happy.  HAPPY wife = Happy LIFE.

I chose the steak burrito since they were out of tamales which I was really craving but they were out.  HOPEFULLY on my next trip they will have these for me to try!.  The meat was tender and all of the ingredients including the rice were on point.  The habanero sauce was a nice touch of heat.

We also had chips and queso which were yummy.

My only wish was this was about $1-$1.50 cheaper per item which would really make this 5 stars in my book.

Great place give it a try you will be glad you did and support the locals!
