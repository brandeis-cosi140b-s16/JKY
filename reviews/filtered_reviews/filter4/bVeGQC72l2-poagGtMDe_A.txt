I went to Cien Agaves for the first time during a trip to Scottsdale, AZ for a friend's rehearsal dinner. I went to Cien Agaves for the second time, the very next day, because this place is so good!

Coming from Upstate NY, I put all my hopes for a good mexican meal during my short trip to AZ in this place. It is loud in here, with the latest top 40 music playing throughout its two floors. There is an outside patio where you can eat tacos outside enjoying the desert air and a $2 taco tuesday.

The shredded beef tacos were completely addicting and I loved that they dotted the guacamole with little pomegranate seeds (so much healthier!). The tortillas were those homemade corn tortillas that you yearn for in the Eastern states. For my friend's rehearsal dinner, they made mini churros that they turned into a fine display. I'm a sucker for mini churros.

This place is great for a quick mexican platter while passing through Scottsdale. If you are interested in using it for a party, it was definitely one of the best mexican buffet style experiences that I have ever tried. I would definitely come back during my next visit.
