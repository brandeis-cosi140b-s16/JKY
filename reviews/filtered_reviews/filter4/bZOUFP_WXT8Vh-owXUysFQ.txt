There was a lot of confusion upon walking in.  I'm not sure if anyone ever mentioned that in a review.  Not in one that I had read anyway.  I didn't know what line to get in, how to learn Spanish in one minute, or what I wanted from all of the delicious choices.  I ended up figuring it out and I have to say, this was the best Adobada I've ever had.  Not that I've had a lot of it but this takes the cake.  

We also had the Chorizo and the Carne Asada fries.  The Chorizo was a little disappointing but after that Adobada with the Pineapple, it didn't really matter.  The service at this place is fast.  They know what they're doing at all of their prospective stations and it shows.  I have wanted to hit this place up for a long time and I finally convinced my wife on one of our Staff days at work.  The food is awesome!
