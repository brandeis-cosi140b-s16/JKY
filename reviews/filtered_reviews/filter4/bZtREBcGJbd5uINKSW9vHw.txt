Authentic Mexican food! A friend claimed this was the best Mexican food in Charlotte - and he might be right. 

As soon as we sat down, they served us an endless amount of chips + salsa. The chips were thin and fresh and the salsa had a bit of a kick. We ordered the queso and Mmmm, so good. 

If you're deciding between the house margarita and the Texas martini - go Texas!! Same price and you get much more bang for your buck. 

I was most excited about my main course - the southwestern plate. so good!! A sunny side egg on top of soft blue tortillas filled with pulled chicken pulled chicken, topped  with an impeccable sauce. Comes with rice, beans and a little bit of lettuce. So authentic and fresh!
