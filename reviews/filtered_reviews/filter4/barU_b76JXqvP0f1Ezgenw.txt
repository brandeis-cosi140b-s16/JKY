This is about The Blind Pig only and not Hobe Meats with whom I was much displeased today, but that's another story.

Had lunch at The Blind Pig today and I was very happy with my experience. They have some wonderful taco choices. I tried the pork, short rib, and mahi mahi. The short rib was my favorite, the pork my least favorite. They probably ended up with four instead of five stars because of that pork - way too dry. The mahi mahi was good, though. You can get a really nice taco plate with two tacos and rice or beans for only $6. I got the beans, hubby got the rice. Both were tasty, but the beans were awesome. The taco plate left me pleasantly full and was bigger than I expected for the price.

Service was very good. We paid a total with tip of only $45 for four people for a really nice lunch with beverages. Seriously, though, you could get away with spending even less. And the food is very good.
