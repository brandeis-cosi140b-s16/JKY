I love Cantina 1511 - we go here all the time, and by and large have always had wonderful experiences, especially when we dine in the restaurant.

I do, though, want to warn y'all about their online ordering - I've used it about 3 times now, and they've never got my order correct. Tonight, for example, I ordered 2 Ancho Pollo tacos, no pico de gallo and not lettuce, and then another 2 taco plate of 1 Ancho Pollo, 1 Marco Pollo. What we received was 2 orders of the 2-taco plates, both with 2 Ancho Pollo tacos with everything - so they didn't affect the modifications to the first order, and they got the 2nd plate only half correct. When I've ordered by phone, the order has always been correct, so I guess I'll forgo the online ordering if favor of the good old fashioned telephone - since clearly they don't have their house in order there.

Love you, Cantina, but if you're going to enter the 21st century, I encourage you to get it right. It's just annoying to offer online ordering and get the order more than 1/2 wrong.
