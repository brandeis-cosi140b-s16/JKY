Really good tex mex joint in South End. This place is REALLY small! Lunch time on weekdays is a challenge, so long as you don't mind saying "excuse me, can you pass me a salsa cup and a straw?" It's advisable to get your order to go, unless you can get a seat at one of their 3 tables outside. The bbq chicken quesadilla is really good. Better than Moe's , better than Salsarita's.
