We had Tacos El Gordo last night for dinner.

The environment is hectic. The place was packed with people and there was a lot of confusion over the fact that you had to stand in different lines for different items. They are set up station style. This can be a little problematic if there is only one of you ordering but you want different things which is why the only thing I ordered was 8 
Tacos De Adobada because I ended up in that line. Next time I will make sure there is at least 3 people with me so one person can stand in each line to order a variety.

The tacos were on your typical small duel corn tortillas flash fried in oil. The meat was sliced right onto the shells and then the tacos were dressed with fresh cilantro, red salsa, chopped onions and then a creamy avocado sauce.

Two thumbs up for the tacos. They were delicious and after we ate them I wish I had ordered about 4 more. There is just something about tacos in the west that are truly fantastic and you just cant beat the prices.
