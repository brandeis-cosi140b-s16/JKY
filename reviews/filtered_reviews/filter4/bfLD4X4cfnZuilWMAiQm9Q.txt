Saw this place on Triple D and Had to try it while I was visiting AZ last weekend. The service was super friendly and the staff was very informative and knew the entire menu. They made great suggestions & we ended up getting two great meals. The combination of the asian-mex was very interesting i loved the fusion of flavors.And the cookie was a great treat :).I would definitely eat there again.
