I went here with my parents and my son (he's 25) a few nights ago.  We have been to many of these in Mexico so we knew what to expect.  First and for most...the staff is superb.  They've only been open a month but they all seem to enjoy it and did the stage dancing and singing like old timers.  The manager Michael was so professional and nice, while being fun.  My dad had on an original se√±or frogs t shirt from decades ago. The manager loved it and brought us an amazing dessert.  Then he was on the stage with his servers dancing.  It was great.  The food service was fast and the drinks were strong, I had a daiquiri. The food is mediocre but who goes there for the food???  You go for the fun and atmosphere.  Drinks by the yard, singing on the stage and the Congo line.  I had the bacon wrapped shrimp...it was ok.  Son had the chicken sandwich and fries...he enjoyed it.  Dad had nachos and mom tacos....both were also enjoyed.  For Vegas the price is reasonable.  Great place for parties like bachelorette, etc, but wouldn't bring young kids (and there were a few in there ).  Also nice outside seating (less boisterous) with w good view.  I will definitely go back.  Thanks mike the manager for making the night so fun for my dad.
