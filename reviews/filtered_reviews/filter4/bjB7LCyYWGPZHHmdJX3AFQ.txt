A girlfriend and I were trying to catch a movie after work, but we had some time before and decided to give this place a try. I'd read mixed reviews about this place was I'll admit I was a bit skeptical trying this place but I was actually very pleased with my visit. 

We arrived a little before 6pm and the place wasn't too packed, we were seated immediately and our waiter was prompt and attentive. The chips and salsa arrived first. The chips were warm...always a good sign! And the salsa was good too! It wasn't too chunky or full of cilantro it was delicious! We practically inhaled the first basket!  

I decided to try the S'Western Nachos with chicken. The nachos come topped with your choice of chicken or beef and black beans, queso, caramelized onions, sour cream, guacamole and cheese. I ordered the half size portion but it was MORE than enough for a good meal. They added a lot of chicken, almost every bite I had included some chicken. I loved them! I would absolutely order them again....but next time with a margarita because I'll have more time! 

I'm going to have to go back and try something else off the menu but so far they win my approval.
