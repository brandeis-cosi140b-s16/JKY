I came here because of Sammy Hagar.

He was in town for Rock 'N Roll Fantasy Camp, so I figured he would come by his bar at least once during his time here.  Well, as far as I know, he didn't.
That said, the food here is very good.  I can vouch for their breakfast menu well, I had both the CW Eggs Benedict and the CW Huevos Rancheros.  Both were excellent, and the CW Home fries were great.  The breakfast adult beverages, the CW Bloody Mary was excellent, up there with some of the best I have ever had.  The Bellini, Blood Orange Mimosa, and regular Mimosa are also good and contain a healthy amount of alcohol.
I also sampled the lunch menu on one of the visits, and had the fish taco's, which were also excellent.  The beans and rice that came with it are also very tasty.
The only complaint is everything is a little pricey, but then again so are most things on the strip.  The food was great, the atmosphere was fun (even without Sammy showing up) and I can check Cabo Wabo off the bucket list after four visits.
