I've been a long time fan. My first visit to this place was wayy back when, literally. I had my first Aunt Chilada's experience when I was 8 and my family and I have been visiting ever since then. Not sure why it took me so long to leave a review.

They have one of the biggest tequila selections in Arizona, by far! And if you're a Tequila connoisseur like myself you will appreciate it.

I'm a big fan of their Sunday brunch. They have a great selection at great prices and can really modify a the plates to your liking if you want. If it's a nice day out, I suggest sitting out on the patio. They have umbrellas to shade your area, but it's cute to see the ducks from the pond hanging out and walking around.
