Great food.  We went with a large party and got great service.  Margaritas were very strong, so beware of how much you consume!  Fortunately, I wasn't driving and the metro is a short walk.  I could have made a meal of the chips and dip.  They had some sort of special seasoning that I couldn't quite place, but I loved them and ate way too many.  We sat outdoors and the weather was great.
