After my first experience with The Mission, I didn't expect there to be a second, at least with my husband anyway.  But after sampling the stew at  Yelp in Bloom, he was open to giving it another shot.  And this time, it did not disappoint either of us.

I have to give 5 stars for the Primarita.  I was hesitant given it has something like half the calories of a standard margarita.  Half the calories and twice as good!  A couple of these and I can almost forgive the price of the guacamole.

After Yelp in Bloom, we had to order the Almejas Al Vapor, that delightfully spicy peruvian stew.  Definitely enough for two and served with plenty of bread to soak up all that broth.  That tends to help keep patrons from drinking from their bowl I'm sure.  We also tried the tostadas prepared with chicken thigh and black beans.  Delicious, but maybe piled just a little too high.  More stuff ended up on my plate than in my mouth with every bite.  Maybe they should line the plate with a tortilla so I could just roll up all the stragglers at the end.  Less forks to wash that way, too.  The grilled street corn was right up there on the good scale with everything else, as well.

Only knocking a star off because everything really is priced just a bit too high IMO.  But this time, I'm sure we'll be back!
