Seriously some of the best fast food mexican stops around. I'm from California and they don't have many Roberto's around here but I wish they did. Yes the food is a bit greasy and yes they mess up my order from time to time but it just taste so good. Their super nachos are the best I've ever had anywhere. Try their super nancho with carnitas and hold the beans. Their even open 24 hours a day!
