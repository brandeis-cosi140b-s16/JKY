Spent  my Sunday afternoon in downtown phoenix and decided to try this new spot  Paz I saw when I was at First Friday. Glad I did.  Paz takes a creative approach to making street tacos. I have never been a fan of Calamari, but if there is one thing on the menu you have to try, it would be the calamari street taco.   Omg, they are delicious!  The atmoshpehere is really cool and laid back. Great music and great staff.t . I almost forgot there are no watered down drinks here!!!  Try the Dangerous Liaison margarita.
