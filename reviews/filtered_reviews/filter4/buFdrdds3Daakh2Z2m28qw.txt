I don't eat fast food, but The Stand burgers are awesome!  My whole family is addicted to this place.  We go at least once a week.  My only request is that they get their fries to be more consistent.  Many times they are over cooked and I prefer them not so crispy.  Hands down, stand burgers are best in town.
