I'm very happy they decided to open another location. Before I needed to drive to the other side of town and while it was well worth it, a shorter drive is always better, if the experience is the same...

And I'm happy to say they have done a great job of bringing a similar experience to the west side of town. They staff is friendly, food consistently excellent and the ambiance feels authentic  (i.e. not like a Denny's with a splash of Mexican paint/art work!). I've already eaten there twice and the Carney dishes are still highly recommended.

The salsa seems a bit different in consistency (very blended) but the taste is the same. I recently tried the fajitas and did not love them. But the fish taco was great (soft, not hard shell!, you'll thank me).

All in all highly recommended, they do not get the five for a few reasons:

1) It was tough for me to find the address of this location. Internet Marketing please!

2) While the newer location is nice, it just doesn't have the feel of the Desert Inn location.

3) I have never been to Lindo and not heard at least one person be wished happy birthday by the staff. I haven't heard this at the new location.

I think Lindo Michoacan has an excellent management team. Never met them, just judging on how the business is run and the feel from the staff. Cheers!
