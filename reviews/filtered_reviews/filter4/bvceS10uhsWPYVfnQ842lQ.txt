Cornbread was fantastic but my little "side" portion was $5.  I know it's a pricey area, but some of the menu items are really up there, especially mixed drinks.  Even at happy hour it's tough to get out of there with a modest tab.   Queso-like appetizer was good as well.  Margaritas were so-so.  Nice atmosphere with ethnic theme, definately nicer than most Mexican places with a more clean cut demographic customer base.
