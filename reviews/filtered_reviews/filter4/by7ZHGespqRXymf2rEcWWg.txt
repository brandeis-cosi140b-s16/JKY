I read some bad reviews before going here so I was a little nervous,  but I really wanted to try this place so I went anyways... and I'm really glad I did because I loved it! I will definitely be going back! The food and drinks we tried were amazing and very decently priced! About $9 for a margarita,  $14 for a plate of 4 street tacos, $5.50 for a large side of fried plantains,  and about $9 for chips and guacamole (that one was a little pricey!).  My friend and I split every thing and ended the evening at about $30 each... really not bad for a nice dinner out in Vegas!  

The only thing I didn't like is that the consider themselves to be family style dining so they bring each dish out as its ready instead of bringing everything together. .. so my tacos came out 5 minutes after my friends. 

I highly recommend the mango Chipotle guacamole... it's got a unique sweet and smokey flavor that I loved. and the Pastor tacos... roasted pork with grilled pineapple,  yum! 

Since they are very new i also highly recommend you make a reservation!  I did and we were seated immediately but on a Friday night there were a lot of people waiting
