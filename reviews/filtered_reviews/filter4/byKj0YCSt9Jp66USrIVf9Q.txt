Whoa, Verde is giving Salt a run for my money! 

I don't care much for tequila (primarily because it makes me tired), but I am hot on the Copa de Fuego, a well balanced cocktail of resposado, jalapeno, cardamom and lime. When I say well balanced, I mean it brings sweet, spicy, sour and bitter flavors together into one smoooth highly drinkable concoction - not at all like swallowing fire. It lures me in for more. While I am there, I take advantage of the complimentary chips and yummy salsa verde. The chips don't seem that fresh to me, they're not warm nor glistening, but they're also not bad for the price. Now the Empanadas are amazing! The dough is uniquely fluffy, the filling of grilled corn and beans is flavored with fresh crisp peppers and the chipotle sauce is mouth-wateringly good. Great texture all throughout. I've also tried the Chiles Rellenos de Hongos, which features the same delicious chipotle sauce over poblanos stuffed with wild rice and mushrooms. A large dish, a bit spicy, best shared among lovers. 

I've only ever sat at the bar, by choice. On my most recent visit, there weren't any seats in the house, anywhere. The hosts were super nice and accommodating. We took a tiny standing table by the bar and chips were promptly delivered. A very friendly server pointed out the hooks under the table for us to hang the things we were awkwardly holding in the middle of the bustling restaurant and one of the bartenders saw to it that we got seats. Make reservations if you are organized enough.
