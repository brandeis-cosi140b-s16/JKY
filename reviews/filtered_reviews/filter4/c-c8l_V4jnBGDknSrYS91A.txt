Have you ever experienced molcajete? HAVE YOU?!

This is THE place to have that experience. I say "experience" because molcajete is more like a witch's bubbling brew than a meal. Mariscos is a cozy little restaurant in an area a lot of people won't flock to, but it stays busy. All the good stuff applies here... friendly service, great food, Mexican beers, Mariachis (on Fridays, I believe). It's just a great place. And, now that the formalities are out of the way, I can talk about the molcajete. 

Molcajete is actually the name of the stone bowl that is used more traditionally as a mortar for salsas and such. As a dish though, it's a beautiful mixture of spicy/tangy sauce, grilled meats, grilled veggies, and cheese. It's one of my favorite Mexican dishes, period. Mariscos serves theirs with tons of fixins (beans, tortillas, salsas, etc.) that could probably fill two people up on their own, but their generous serving is much appreciated when ordering this dish for a small group. It's definitely one of those meals that'll impress people when it gets served. Order one for the table, and you're going to have a good time.

I could spout on all day about molcajete... But, would ya look at that, I have a decent size review already, and I haven't even talked about the restaurant's specialty, seafood. Well, I'll let you read some other reviews for that. I'll just say that I love their tostadas de ceviche de camaron! 

Go to Mariscos Playa Hermosa, and enjoy!
