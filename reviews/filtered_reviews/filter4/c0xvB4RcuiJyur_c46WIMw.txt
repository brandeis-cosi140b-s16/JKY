I liked our meal at La Fonda Del Sol.  Two kinds of salsa, fresh chips, and really good food.  For comparison, I got the Flamingo Dinner and my wife got the Shredded Beef Chimichanga.  The difference is rice and beans, and even though the rice and beans were good, I don't think it was worth the extra money.  Does this mean that the full plate should be cheaper or the chimi should be $1 more?  I don't know, I guess it depends what the competition is charging.

Although the food was good and the service was friendly, we got there around 8:30 PM on a Saturday night and the place needed a really good cleaning.  I was kicking plastic drink lids and other refuse that was under my table, so I think the place needs to be swept a bit more frequently.  I was also a little surprised at how quiet it was in there because some other businesses seemed to be busier.  But that's okay, we had a good meal and I would go back if I lived in the area.
