Used a $5 for $10 coupon and ordered the carne asada taco plate, it was fine. The meat wasn't as tender as I'm used to but the rice and beans were tasty. The staff was quirky but very nice and my plate arrived within 5 minutes of ordering. I work in the area and will return for lunch in the future. Thanks Fuego!
