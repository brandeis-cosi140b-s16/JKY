After reading the reviews, and having a friend tell me there was a restaurant near me that Man Vs. Food visited, I had to try it!  I was not disappointed one bit!  The Torta Del Ray, is AMAZING, 3lbs of awesomeness!  I didn't know until I bit into it, that there is actually a hot dog in it... lol.  This place knows how to make a torta, and how to make customers keep coming back.  I will continue to visit this place regularly.  You cannot beat the cheap price, for the large amount of food!
