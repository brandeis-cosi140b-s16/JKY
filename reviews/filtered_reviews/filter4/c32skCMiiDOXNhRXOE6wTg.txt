I loved this fine dining Mexican restaurant at the Aria Resort & Casino. It is visually very beautiful and unique in it's layout and decor. Based only upon my one meal and drinks here, I give my star rating of 4 stars. It's lively and fun with good service. The food was very good though pricey, but what you'd expect from like establishments in Las Vegas. I would definitely come back to it again.
