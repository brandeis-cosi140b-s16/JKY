Pretty decent Mexican food place! Got chips and salsa for a starter and had red enchiladas for the entree. Pretty good service, nothing crazy good about the service or food. I wouldn't mind coming back here again, although I'll keep searching for the best Mexican restaurant in town! Can't really complain!
