Solid Mexican food.

This is actually one of the better Mexican places, but it does depend on what you order.  I have found their chicken to be very dry and lacking in flavor... however, everything else is tasty.  Their salsa is great and they serve free bean dip with every table.  The service is friendly and quick and their beans are very good.  This place is in my lunch rotation and is definitely better than most Mexican spots.
