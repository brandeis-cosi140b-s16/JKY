Went on a early Friday evening good thing this place was over busy . By the time we left (6:00) it was standing room in and out! 1st impression clean, very courteous staff 
It was very noisy in main room kids screaming well you get it . Maybe lunch would be better 
Now to the food --- right away they brought us our drinks with chips , salsa,& bean dip . Also a small plate of grilled sweet onions & jalape√±o chiles nice ...I had a chile relleno & beef soft flour tortilla taco! I always order the relleno @ new places I go to & if it's good all else can't be to bad .
My partner ordered chili Colorado with side of black beans  very good ! he does not like cilantro & I think the red sauce although yummy had to much coriander oh well ! All in all very hopping place will try again on a slower week day!!!!
