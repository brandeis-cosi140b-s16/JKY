In Scottsdale escaping Chicago cold. After a few nights of hotel food we wanted casual Mexican. This is the place: family run, small, authentic food. Crazy cute waiter who dared my husband to try their hottest salsa. It was a mouth burner...Avoid house margaritas, go for better choice. Queso fundido with chorizo, onion, black beans: yum. Tacos flavorful and right sized. Outdoor patio. Loved this place.
