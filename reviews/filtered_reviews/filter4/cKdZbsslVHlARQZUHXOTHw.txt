Happened upon this restaurant while staying at a nearby hotel. We drove by earlier in the day and were first interested in the unique architecture of the building. The decor inside was fun and had an old-school feel. Lots of pink and green, neon lights, mirrors, and wall murals. I loved it!

Went in for dinner a little late, still being on west coast/vacation time, but there were still quite a few people and we weren't rushed at all. Our server was very friendly and helpful when we asked about the menu, even though she needed to check with the kitchen on some of our particular needs. 

We started with two margaritas and the Espinaca con queso. Unfortunately it was missing spinach. Hmm... There were some green chiles, however, that added to the cheese dip. I ordered a beef chimichanga with their famous baja sauce. OH how I love this white, creamy, spicy sauce!! Maybe a spicy sour cream? It was delicious! Hubby got steak fajitas which were good, but believe it or not, I was hooked on the grilled onions! They were so flavorful! I'm glad there were a lot on his platter so I could steal more than a few.
