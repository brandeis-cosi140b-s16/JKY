This is some crazy spicy food.  They use New Mexico Hatch chilies, which are no joke.  I order a full side each of sour cream and guacamole just to get through the meal.  If you enjoy spicy food, you must try this.  If you don't enjoy spicy food, I still think you should try it (just get the sour cream like I do).  There are some non-spicy items on the menu of course, but they look so much less interesting...

One of their specialties, and my personal favorite, is an enchilada with an egg on top.  I got it hoping the egg would alleviate some of the heat, and it didn't, but it turned out being darn good.  Beware: the spiciness induces a high intake of the house margarita.

During peak lunch hours, the restaurant can get pretty busy.  This means long wait times.  This also means more margaritas.

Service isn't top-shelf, but they do what they need to do.  I've had a hard time getting someone's attention if it's outside the requisite seating/ordering/serving milestones (that's how I learned to order the sour cream immediately...I just can't wait for that).

Finally, the tab can get kinda pricy.  Especially if you had lots of margaritas.  An average entree is about $15, which I feel is high for lunch.  I enjoy going, but I won't do it often... it's just not *quite* worth the bill.
