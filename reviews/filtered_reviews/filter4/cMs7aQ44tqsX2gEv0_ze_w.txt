We decided to go to Yolos today after a bit of shopping.  Our server, Margie took great care of us.  I had the shrimp tacos & they were delicious!!  My husband had the shrimp fajitas & he loved them too.  The cilantro rice was so good, I should have gotten a second order of it! I  really like that you get guacamole on your plate with your food & it isn't an upcharge.
We are locals & we will recommend Yolos when people come to town!
