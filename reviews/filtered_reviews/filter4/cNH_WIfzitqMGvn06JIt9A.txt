This little dive got some extra recognition last week when it was featured in an article on Yahoo about "the ten best tacos in America".  I'd never heard of it, and was excited to try it.

Got there right around noon, and there was a line of about 10-12 people.  It went quick, and my order was taken - very good customer service, very friendly.  However, it took nearly 30 minutes for me to get my food.  It may just be today, so it's not going to stop me from coming back, but that is just too long.

When my food finally did arrive, it was amazing.  I had two carne asada tacos, one chicken, one fish.  The fish taco is their standout - very fresh, just right.  The others were great as well.

If you're looking for a romantic atmosphere with candles on the table, and light jazz music in the corner, look elsewhere!  This hole in the wall has great Mexican street tacos, and friendly staff.  Tacos Atoyac is worth a trip to the West side - but if you're like me and live or work nearby, you should get over there - but maybe avoid the peak hours, just in case.
