I'd give this a 5 but I think we should all leave room for improvement. 

I moved here from CA and was looking for a mom/pop type place for good Mexican food. I found this on Yelp and have to say I am really happy with what I've had here. First I had a Breakfast Burrito (Chorizo) and then added sour cream. Perfect! 

Next time I was in for dinner I tried their Chile Verde burrito. I had them add beans. Wow...really really good! Hit the spot! 

I think I found my new "go-to" favorite!
