The salt foam margarita is so delicious that it goes down too fast, and the second one soon reflects the alcohol in both.  The menu is mixed in quality, but three separate tacos - lobster, beef tongue, and crisped tendon with oyster-- are accompanied by flavorful salsa or spices and are world-class delicious.  Two big bites render them expensive, but far less than a few minutes at the tables or machines and guaranteed winners.  Excellent service, uncomfortable backless chairs, bright and fun ambience, a must stop apart from price and some duds on menu.
