The area is sketchy but the inside is nice. It is located in Sahara and Lamb so don't be surprised on the cop cars always driving around. 

I had a Groupon to spend at this place. It's totally out of place for me. I ordered the #1 combo that comes with two tacos, a drink, and chips and salsa (or you could get rice and beans). I ordered another taco cause I thought two wouldn't fill me up. 

I got two asada tacos, and one lengua tacos. Man oh man, the tortillas are defo homemade and handmade with love. I took a bite out of my asada taco and surprise in the bottom, refried beans! I wasn't expecting that!

The chips and salsa...well the salsa was also unexpecting full of sweet and spicy. The tomatoes were cut not into diced and square norms but smashed. I actually enjoyed it. It had a taste of sweetness from the tomatoes and actually spiciness of it being a salsa.

I definitely recommend Abuelita's when you in the east side of Vegas looking for some good Mexican food.
