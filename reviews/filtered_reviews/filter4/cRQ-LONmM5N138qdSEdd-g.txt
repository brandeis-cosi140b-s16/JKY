One of the best Mexican places I've been to in Vegas.  I don't think many places offer goat on the menu (although it just tasted like pork shoulder) but the outdoor area is nice for a group.  Great guacamole and the after hours menu although limited is cheap and very filling.  I often wonder who comes here at 7am and what do they order???  I assume its just Red Rock staff people but I could be wrong.  The decor is quite cool as are the restrooms!
