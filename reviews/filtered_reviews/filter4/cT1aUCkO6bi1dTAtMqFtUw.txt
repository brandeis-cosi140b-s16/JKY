Chose Azteca over another Mexican restaurant nearby based on the reviews on yelp and I'm glad I did.  Sat at the bar and had a 32oz beer and chips and salsa in front of me almost immediately. 
Decided to order the chicken fajitas and they were delicious. After eating all of the chips and salsa, I ended up being able to bring home 2 fajitas.  I didn't get the table side guac, but I saw it made for 2 different tables nearby and it looked great. They also lowered the price from what some people are reviewing...$6.95 for one avocado and $8.95 for 2. 
Great place to grab some delicious Mexican food. Their lunch menu looked really great and cheap too.
