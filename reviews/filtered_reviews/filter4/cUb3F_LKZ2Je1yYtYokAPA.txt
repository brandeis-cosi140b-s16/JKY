An excellent choice for authentic Mexican food. The bottomless chips and salsa the waitress brought at the beginning of the meal were excellent. These were constantly refilled throughout our meal. 

My personal favorites are the carne asada and the cheese, beef and jalapeno nachos. My dining companions enjoyed the chicken enchiladas and the cheese quesadillas. There is a list of tequilas available for every taste. They have Dos Equus Amber on tap (my favorite). The sopopillas for dessert are the best in Phoenix.

The decor is shopworn but comfortable. The service is very good without being intrusive. There is parking available in their lot or on the street. They accept credit cards.
