This place ROCKS.  My family showed up, a dozen of us or so, without warning on a Saturday evening and the owner/manager (whoever he was) was so gracious to accommodate us.  The food was really good and the atmosphere lively.  In spite of our sizeable group and a humongous group that came in just after us they still got our food out to our tables in a reasonably short time, hot and delicious.  They kept our chips and salsa (very good salsa, by the way) replenished throughout our stay.  We left happy and satisfied.
