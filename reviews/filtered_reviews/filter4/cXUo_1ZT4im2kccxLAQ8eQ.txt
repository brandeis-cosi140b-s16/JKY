The Stand is great. It's like a wet dream of a fast food establishment. Fresh and quality ingredients, good service, and decent prices. You can't go wrong with their tacos or burger; both are solid (Chicken tacos are a personal favorite). Milk Shakes are quality too (especially salted caramel). In a perfect world, the Burger Kings and McDonalds out there would be replaced with establishments like this. Nothing crazy, just good solid food made well. 

One huge plus side here too is that they are great for people who must eat Gluten Free. Pretty much everything on the menu is either already gluten free (all the tacos, fries, chips) or can be made that way (the burger). They even have gluten free hamburger buns, which I don't see at too many places. 

I'd love to see this place be successful, because fast food that is actually GOOD is in short supply. It'd be great to see places like this start popping up more often. 

(Sad side note...this used to be the building where Maui Dog was...hate to see that place go, thought it was great; but glad the building was taken over with something else good like this)
