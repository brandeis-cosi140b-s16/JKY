Found this place on Yelp, went to check it out.
Staff is friendly, the place is clean and has interesting decor.
the food was really good.  My hubby had the green pork burrito with green sauce.  Very tasty!  I had the fry bread (which I have never had before) with machaca, also really good.  We live close by and like a good mexican place, so we'll be back!

the chips and salsa bar is a good idea, you can take what you are going to eat and not waste a bunch of stuff.  Green salsa was good, but I really liked the red.  Especially with the fresh bits of peppers and stuff.  yummy
