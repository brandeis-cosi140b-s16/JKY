Best place to go to in Vegas for tacos! Especially when you're hungry after a night out clubbing/drinking. it's on the strip and located right next to Encore, so if the taxi line is super long, I suggest you try some Taco El Gordo! The tacos are cheap $2! It might take awhile for the food to come out since everyone goes there late after a night out clubbing, but it's worth the wait.
