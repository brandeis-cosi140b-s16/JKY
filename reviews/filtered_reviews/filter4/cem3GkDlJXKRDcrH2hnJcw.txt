Braised beef taco and fried fish taco!! 

The restaurant opened recently and I think it's gonna be one of the new trendy places to go to this year. It was very busy when 4 of us went and waited about a half hour on a Friday night. It was our first time there and the ceviche really stood out so we tried to order that but the server said they sold the last one, but recommended the tuna stack. It was good, and makes me curious what the ceviche would be like. 

So, they have this deal in the menu, when you order three tacos, you get a side for free. I chose the braised beef, the fried fish taco, and the chicken taco with a lime aioli sauce and the rice on the side. I didn't like the chicken at all, but the braised beef was juicy and succulent and yum!! My friend also states the grilled fish taco was great too! But he didn't like the carne asada, it was too sweet, he said. He also ordered pinto beans as his side but the server said the last one sold out too, so he settled for black beans 

The servers were all really busy but still very Attentitive. I took off a star because of the food that wasn't available and because when a different server brought out our food, they only brought 8 tacos and I said we ordered nine and we had to straighten it out with the original server first before they brought out the last taco. Just a tiny hiccup in an otherwise seamless night. 

They also have unique drink choices. They have these juices from freshly squeezed fruits which can be served with alcohol. I tried the cucumber mint with gin and it was very refreshing!
