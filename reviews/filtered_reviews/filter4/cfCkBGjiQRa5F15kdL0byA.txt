I was craving a burrito last night and didn't want to stop at the usual suspects (Chipotle/Rubio's/El Pollo Loco/Filib's), I turned to Yelp and this place came up with great reviews. I walked in to the small shop about 20 minutes 'til closing and it looked like just the owner/cook and his daughter manning the ship. I spent some time scanning the menu and when I was ready he helped take my order. I had a burrito with red chile chicken and most of the fixins. They were out of cheese for the night so I got some guacamole gratis which was nice. While the daughter was ringing me up he gave me a sample of their taquitos they have coming out which was good. I drove home and dug in to my burrito, chips and salsa, and horchata. The horchata was on par, their hot salsa is in fact hot and very good. The burrito was really good - it seemed standard before biting into it but it's very flavorful which must be a testament to the care that goes into making all of the ingredients. I'l definitely be back.
