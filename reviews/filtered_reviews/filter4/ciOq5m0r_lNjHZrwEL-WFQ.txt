Amazing, but everyone that has ever gone to Chandler High School always returns to Elmers!  Why?  Because they have great food!  Bean and cheese burro with sauce and strips - I have only had this meal a thousand or more times in the last 30 years...  Elmers hot sauce is the best ever - and the cheese on the strips tastes SO GOOD along with that hot sauce!!!  Not much on decor inside, so get it to go -and enjoy!!!
