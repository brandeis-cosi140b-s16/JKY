Nice ambiance and staff is usually friendly.  I've enjoyed happy hours at the bar as well countless meals (lunch and dinner) over the years inside (cozy) and both sides of the patios.  Friends, family, work, dates... all works here.  Do not expect "mexican" fyi - stick to tex-mex definition (blend of Mexican and Southern American).  Great cornbread that comes out pre dinner. I've never been disappointed.  It can be pretty busy on the weekends.  Enjoy.
