A very cute, Americanized Mexican restaurant that's best for a younger crowd. My boyfriend and I have been a few times, because they serve their full menu until 2 am on weekends (always a plus). The drinks are well-priced (that $3 margarita really isn't bad, and if you're feeling adventurous, fork over the extra 3 bucks and try one of their other signature drinks. The blackberry tequila one is delicious), and the food is pretty good. 

I think one of the best things about this place is they have LOTS of delicious vegetarian options. The rajas tacos are a little expensive, but very delicious. And the enchiladas are quite good, too. 

The service here is your typical bar-service, but everyone is very nice. The only issue is it's very, very loud, and they play loud music atop the noise. But, hey, it's a bar. That's what you're there for.
