This place is the bomb! Take it your in the mood for Mexican food. Well around this area you have Cafe Rio, Chipotle, Nacho Daddy and Baja Fresh (maybe still open). Maybe you've tried that already so why not try a little something more homemade.

Their Carne Asada tacos are well worth the drive. For $3 you get one big ass taco and they aren't cheap with their meat, lol.

My girlfriend tried the Taquitos/Chicken which weren't nothing out of this world, but the quality of shredded chicken was good. 

The mole enchiladas are something you won't find anywhere around
