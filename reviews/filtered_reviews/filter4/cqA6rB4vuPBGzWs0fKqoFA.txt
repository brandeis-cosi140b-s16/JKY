Steak taco, chicken taco, empenada, crochetas. 

Was a bit disappointed by the tacos, I expected bolder layers but then when cooking for the public it's hard to really indulge as one would otherwise. I am pretty sure the chef pulled a punch or two on these and would like to know what he would do them when cooking for himself.

Empenada was outstanding. Can't say enough.

Crochetas were one of those rare experienceso that teach you something new, really quite amazing. Layers were just right, varied and bold, I loved them. The star of the show if you know what you are looking for. Great job chef.

Service was friendly, people there are just great.

Particularly love the architecture. Shipping containers. Just brilliant. Looks cool AF and Earth friendly.
