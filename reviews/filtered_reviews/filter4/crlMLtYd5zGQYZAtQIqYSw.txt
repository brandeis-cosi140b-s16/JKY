I am a texmex junkie! I could eat it everyday. Cabo Wabo was a pretty good experience and here is why : 

1. The nachos were very good. Also the chips and dips were good also.
2. I ordered the beef tacos with rice. My food was good and large in portion size. Not the best I've had but okay.
3. Our waitress was cranky at first but warmed up. 

Would go there for happy hour
