Went here for a company birthday party and I must say that the waitress we got, was on her game.
She was working our table, 12 people and a few others that were 2-4 people and she didnt miss a beat.

The food was good. The albondigas soup was awesome. Im kinda plain when it comes to ordering, so I had myself a couple shredded beef tacos with some rice.  The beef was seasoned nicely and was a lil too tender for my liking, but good for the most part.

The atmosphere is great. They do karaoke(or at least i hope it was karaoke, not a band) when it gets a lil later into the evening.
