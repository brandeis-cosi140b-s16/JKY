Huge selection of tacos.  Carne asada, pollo asada and carnitas tacos all great. Ahi tacos we're huge with fresh seared ahi.  Loved my cucumber mint margarita...super refreshing on a hot night.  My son was disappointed in his Big Ass Burrito with green sauce...said it was average.  Go here for the tacos!

By the way, if you like really spicy salsa with your chips, you need to ask for it.
