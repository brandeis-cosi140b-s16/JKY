There are so many mixed reviews on this long-standing Cave Creek restaurant/landmark (or tourist trap, depending on how you see it), that I wasn't sure what to expect when I went there for lunch about three weeks ago. Would there be duck poo on my chair? Would I be attacked by giant swan in heat? Is the place really run by lollygagging teenagers? 

To be perfectly honest, I spent most of the time feeding the ducks with my two-year old nephew, who became ecstatic when he saw the pond and wildlife. But during the short time I spent sitting at my table, actually eating my lunch and interacting with the (yes, very young) waitstaff, I can say that I experienced no major indignities (actually, no indignities at all). I went on a Wednesday during the busy lunch rush, and I have no major complaints about the service or food. The hostess quickly accommodated our request to be seated outside, our waiter was polite and attentive, and although the food certainly doesn't reinvent the wheel, it was standard Mexican comfort food, in all its yellow cheese glory. I wouldn't call El Encanto a foodie destination, but a perfectly nice place to consume cheesy lunch calories if you happen to be in the area.
