Fine chips and a wonderful salsa bar to start off your tex-mex meal right.

As a vegetarian, there are usually options at Mexican or Tex-mex places, but Tex Tubb's Atwood burrito is a breath of fresh air. Not just beans and cheese at us, this is a flavor and ingredient packed burrito I can get behind. 

The wait staff is fine, not phenomenal, but quite adequate.
