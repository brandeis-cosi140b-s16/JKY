Leticia's is definitely my favorite local Mexican restaurant.  They usually prepare consistently good fresh food and the price is hard to beat.  Their carnitas, fish tacos, chile relleno, and buritos are some of the best you will find in the Las Vegas area.  Their chips and salsa are also decent.  The atmosphere is very nice and the decor has a warm and friendly feel.  Although I've occasionally had less than stellar service, it is usually very good.  If you're in the Northwest, chances are good Leticia's will be your choice when it comes to Mexican food.
