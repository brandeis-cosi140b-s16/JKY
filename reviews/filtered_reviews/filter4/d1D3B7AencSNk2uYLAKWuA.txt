We hadn't been to the Hard Rock in a couple of years, especially to eat. On our first visit many years ago we found the food at PT to be average and the wait staff snobby. This time we were pleasantly surprised by our attentive and professional server, Dena (sp) and the food to be very good. I would even considering staying here on our next visit based on our positive meal. 

I ordered the chicken tostada salad which was flavorful and well prepared. The portion was extremely large and could have been shared. My son ordered a specialty burrito which was equally large and tasty. We were there during happy hour and ate at the bar and enjoyed 2 for 1 beers. So our meal was also a great value.
