I love this location, all the employees are very friendly and they get your food out quickly without the usual hiccups and mistakes that other high-volume places make. The food is great for what it is, tacos that aren't soaked in grease, cheese that doesn't turn to rubber the second it cools down, tortillas to die for, etc... Great experience every time!
