Some of the best Mexican food can be found in my old home town of Las Cruces, NM, so I am particular about it. While Carlos has their own style of food, there are a few dependable items which are wonderful. Their margaritas are excellent, the spicy bean dip is authentic, and the appetizer folded, shredded quesadillas are very, very good. The chips are pretty much bottomless and the dip is good. The spinach con queso dip, while good, is really an american thing and not so much mexican. The service is excellent. The mini tacos are also very good. But I long for Las Cruces food...
