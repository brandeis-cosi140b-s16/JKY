Went for the first time today, pretty good.  The d√©cor is interesting, not your run of the mill sombreros and chili peppers.  For first timers you are offered a taste of all the meats before you order which is nice! There are plenty of toppings for your taco and a salsa bar.  We also ordered chips and guacamole.  The guac was very fresh but compared to the meats for the tacos it seemed to seriously lack seasoning and I found myself dumping salsa and lime on it to try and give it a little zip.  The prices are very reasonable, but since this place is quite a distance from home and there are so many very good Mexican food places to choose from and nothing that really wowed me I probably won't go back.
