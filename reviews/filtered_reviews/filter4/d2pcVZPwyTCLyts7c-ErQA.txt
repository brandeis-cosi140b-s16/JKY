I'm a huge fan, but twice after going, I've had my credit card numbers stolen. Happened to my fiance, and just found out this happened to my friend, too. Four times seems a little more than a coincidence and the only thing in common is a recent visit to Cabo. (Just heard about three more instances. That makes 7!)

Love it, but use cash.

And I highly recommend the BBQ Mahi tacos - best thing on the menu. Great flavor!
