*our waiter was super friendly and our food came out super fast

*The chips were probably made there because they came out hot and were so amazing

*the tacos were some of the best tacos I've had in Vegas

*the only downfall, be prepared to pay $4.25 for ONE taco. AND everything is ala carte.

* I heard it's only $2 for tacos during happy hour. Will definitely be coming back but during that time only.
