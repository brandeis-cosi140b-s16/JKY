After a recent trip to New Mexico, I have to say that this food is very much authentic New Mexican cuisine. The flavors are all there, and they don't cut corners. When the menu says green chilies, you actually get Hatch chilies and not Anaheim peppers (unlike many restaurants outside of the Rio Grande Valley). The menu isn't large, but it has many categories to suit anyone's preference and hits all the right notes (and your wallet will think so, too). The fare is anything but ordinary in true New Mexican fashion, from burgers to enchiladas and rellenos, to seafood, pork, beef, and chicken plate dinners, pizza, pasta, and salads. I highly recommend the chorizo stuffed pecan-grilled chicken with red pepper mashed potatoes (served stuffed in a Hatch chili!). Pecan grilling is found on many menu items and it an integral part of the flavor profile of New Mexico, giving meats a nice sweet, smokey flavor. The margaritas good sized and priced well, and are well-balanced (not too sugar-y or syrup-y). They even offer a prickly pear margarita, which is my personal favorite. The atmosphere is very comfortable and well decorated and is furnished more like a cozy lodge than a restaurant. The bar also has flat screen TVs for sports fans. Any time I have eaten here, the staff have been super-friendly and conversational. In short, I would say that if you're looking for something tasty and different to feed your Foodie side, check out the Blue Adobe on Country Club. Small restaurant, big food.
