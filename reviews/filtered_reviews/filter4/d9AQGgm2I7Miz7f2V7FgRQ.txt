We had a few hours before heading to the PHX airport so we stopped by La Santisima for lunch. Being Mexican from SoCal I know good tacos. This place does not disappoint, everything we tried was good. Plenty of taco options and an awesome salsa selection (strawberry salsa my favorite). The only disappointment was that they didn't have any horchata when we arrived. Had the following. 
 
- Sonoran Carne Asada Taco
- Aztec Tinga Taco
- La Condesa Veggie Taco
- Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco

I'd definitely go back and recommend it to anyone looking to get a local meal near the airport (about 5 mins away)
