The Grande nachos will feed a crew of 3-4 without too much trouble...I can't say much more on their other foods because this is all I eat here whenever I visit.  Although I did try their 2 dollar taco and it was pretty tasty.  The beef has a good flavor to it, but it is the soft kind...not "carne asada."  Enjoy!
