Be warned that the ultra-cool and delightfully charming lucha libre d√©cor has been completely removed.  Since this place was a near carbon copy of a concept that was copyrighted in San Diego (name included), they were forced to completely re-brand.  It looks like they'll be opening up a bar and presumably putting up new decor. Until then, you're stuck eating tacos in a sterile looking dining room.  Although the decor is gone, the taco taste thankfully remains.

I've always been a big fan of the tacos here.  The fact that they allow you to sample all of their meats enables you to minimize any ordering mistakes.  Many of their juicier meats are extremely spicy, so I advise you to be careful. Aside from a few desserts (including some good churros), that's pretty much all they have.  But at least what they do have, they do exceptionally well.

I would like to point out that they do seem somewhat disorganized.  The last time we went in, a guy was behind the counter just giving us what appeared to be a "death stare."  It took a few minutes of awkward silence before the lady, who usually takes our orders, told us that he could help us.

Their tacos are still very good and most of the reviews you see on here are accurate - even if I do/will miss the wrestling theme.
