Wow, Talk about making an impact.  I was hands-down ready to give this place a 1 star, but thanks to the bartender Mundo gets a 4 star!  

Upon arrival, Jadira and I were very impressed.  Just from the outside this place looked really classy.  Once we got inside we noticed there was a hostess stand, but no hostess to be found.  I stopped a busser that was coming by and asked if we should just seat ourselves.  He seemed a bit confused and told us to go ahead and seat ourselves and that the server would be right with us.  20 minutes later and we were still sitting there... not a single peep from anyone.  We noticed that there was indeed a purpose for that hostess stand because a hostess had magically appeared.  About 10 minutes in to our wait, a large party arrives and was sat right next to us.  The server totally ignored us and assisted the large party first (accommodating them with water and menus).  At this point, I was getting a little frustrated so I approached the bartender behind the bar.  I had explained that no one had even talked to us and that I was interested in ordering.  She apologized and basically became our server while still running the busy bar.  To make a long story short, thank you to the bartender for saving the night!  After the actual server noticed the bartender talking to us, he finally came over and lit our candle and asked us if we cared for anything to drink.  We told him no thanks that the bartender was already taking care of us. 

We visited Mundo during Happy Hour and was very impressed.  The drinks that we had were amazing (especially that Martini in my opinion).  The pricing wasn't too bad either.  We definitely plan on returning.

What we ordered:  
 * Sangria - I'm not a huge Sangria fan ,but this was good
 * Mundo Martini-  I seriously could have had 3 more of these easy.
 *  Mundo Fries-  Sweet Potato Fries... cooked perfectly!  These were addicting!!
 * Calamari-  We are huge Calamari fans and Mundo is definitely in our top 3 picks.

Pros:
 * The ambiance was very impressive.  We absolutely loved it.  It's alot bigger than it looks too.
 *  Live DJ spinning music.  I don't know if this was because it was First Friday, but definitely had good vibes throughout.
 *  Really good Happy Hour.  All I got to sample (food-wise) were appetizers, but if this was any indication of what the rest of the menu has to offer, then I'm sure I'm in for a treat when I go to enjoy the full Mundo dining experience.
 * Amazing Service (from the Bartender)... Thank you sooo much!

Cons:
* Bad Service (missing hostess and didn't get acknowledged for nearly 30 minutes!

Overall:
  I really only had one complaint and it was a big one, but once we did get service and received our food, we were instant fans.  I can't wait to come here and try other things from the menu.  I'll be back and will surely update my review once I am able to do so.  

Tips:
 * Try the Calamari (I'm not sure what the sauces are ,but both were really good).
 * Once it gets warmer, there is outside seating.
