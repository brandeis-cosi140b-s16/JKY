Had lunch there today and was pretty danged impressed with my torta.

I had the Norteno, which was steak, cheese, tomato, avocado and a fried egg.  It was really tasty.   And quite a bargain at $6.99 since I could barely finish it.

Service was quick, friendly and excellent, even though it was the lunch rush and they were at capacity.  Pleasant atmosphere also.
