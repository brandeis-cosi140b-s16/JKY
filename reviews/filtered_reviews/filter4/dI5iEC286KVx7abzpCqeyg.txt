By far one of the BEST Mexican restaurants I've been to from LA to Las Vegas.

They give you chips salsa, and a warm bean dip to start!

I ordered the Ceviche tostada to start and my main  course was the hueto plate that included a chicken taco, tostada, and enchilada. The food was so flavorful and well seasoned that I didn't need any salsa!!! 

The salsa is actually my only issue. It lacked flavor, and was a little too spicy for me and they only have spicier salsa, so I was a bit disappointed that my request for Pico de Gallo was turned down, but if spicy is your thing then this place will hit the spot!

Overall it was a wonderful experience and somewhere I will ABSOLUTELY visit anytime I'm in Las Vegas!
