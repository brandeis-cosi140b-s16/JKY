Really fast service for a Friday night. They brought out our drinks quickly, with chips and 3 kinds of salsa [mild, hot, and omgwtfhot]. The guacamole was pretty onion-y. Lay back guys.

Two of us ordered cheese enchiladas. It was one of the cheaper meals, at 10.95. It came with rice and beans. The other ordered a burrito verde. Pretty huge, and a bit more [$13.95, I think] but very good.
