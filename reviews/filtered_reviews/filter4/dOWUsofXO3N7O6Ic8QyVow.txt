In Arizona for a few days & missing Mexican food already. Moreno's is a tasty little Mexican food place with friendly service! We all enjoyed our food...Tried the Southwestern Shrimp Burro - shrimp was plenty & the pineapple gave it a little sweet kick (very different than anything I've ever had). However, the Crab Relleno was AMAZING! It was stuffed with crab & had this delicious jalape√±o cream sauce that made the dish perfection! 5 star dish!
