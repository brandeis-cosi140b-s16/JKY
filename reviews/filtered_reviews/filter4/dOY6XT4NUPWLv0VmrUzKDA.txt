On the weekends, Arribas is the best kept secret in Gilbert for breakfast.  You can't beat the Bacon and Eggs for $5.99 http://www.arribamexicangrill.com/imx/menu_items/breakfast/breakfast3_big_r1_c1.jpg

Two eggs, two strips of some the best country style bacon you've ever had served with country potatoes and two buttermilk pancakes.  My wife swears by the Huevos Rancheros Stacker.  

While Denny's and IHop are backed up outside with standing room only to wait 30-45 minutes, Arribas usually has no waiting mostly because people don't think of them for breakfast (weekends only), However, even with breakfast, they greet you with free chips, salsa and the best bean dip in town.  Relaxing mariachi music playing in the background in a relaxed Mexican Cantina setting to start your weekend off right. They also brew several of their own beers including a really fine tasting Pilsner that goes great with Cardinals games! http://www.arribamexicangrill.com/microbrews.php  If you have kids, they have a deal for kids under 10 on Sunday with a parents meal.(Check the menu or call the restaurant for details) http://www.arribamexicangrill.com/breakfast_menu.php

All in all a great weekend breakfast!
