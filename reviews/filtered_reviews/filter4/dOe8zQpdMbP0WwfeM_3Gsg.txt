I was in the Lamp Store in Boca when I spotted this place. I'm not very observant and apparently it has been here a while without me noticing.

I jump in for lunch and take a seat at the bar. I am immediately i.d.'ed which seemed a little strange as I have not, sadly, been asked for my i.d. for about 21 years AND I had ordered just an iced-tea. 

It is a strange choice of location, situated on a corner with open doors and each side and wind blowing through. Nice but your view is the Target parking lot and party City. 

I order some tacos, choice of six fillings, they arrived quickly and were tasty and well priced. TVs everywhere and a few interior tables. I like it and I will go back.
