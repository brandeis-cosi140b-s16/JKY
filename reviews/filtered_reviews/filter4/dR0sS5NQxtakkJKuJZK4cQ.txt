Recently checked this place out. Got there early, thank goodness because after 630, the place turns into a seriously overcrowded, hot room, of typical "Scottsdale" barbie dolls. That aside, I must say this:

GREAT SERVICE! GREAT FOOD! GREAT MARAGARITAS! and an awesome staff who were very attentive and personable! 

We tried a lot of things on their menu, but I must say the maragarita with the jalapenos was my favorite margarita. It was so fresh and tangy. 

The taqueria style street tacos were killer!!! two words Beef Cheek! I definitely recommend them. The Duck were awesome too. 

The Carne Asada torta was killer good as well. just really big! My hubby and I split everything and were there from about 5pm until 8 or so and it was a good time. 

Fun people watching as well. Next time we go, and we will return, we want to rent a table with the tap attached and bring a ton of friends. 

Worth the time to travel there, find it, and enjoy the atmosphere. its definitely a  fun vibe!
