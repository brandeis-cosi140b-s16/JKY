The name of this place sounds like it should be a secret swingers joint, but I do believe it is not although last time one of my buddies was here, he got hit on by a cougar.  Instead, it's a sweet little hole in the wall bar serving delicious New Mexican cuisine and yummy beer.  It's dark with limited room at the bar and few tables however that just adds to the ambiance.  Dicks is a great place to watch a game if you don't want to go to some lame ass sports bar or just a fun place to grab a brew with one of your friends.  Rock on Dicks.. hmmm, that sounded really bad.
