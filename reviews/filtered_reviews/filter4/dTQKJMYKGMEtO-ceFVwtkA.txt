This is my fourth time here I'm extremely happy with the food buy however every time service is severely lacking. This time checked out the bathroom, I had my little niece with me and I was very upset with the setup. No changing table, unacceptable and then the soap is in tacky cheap squeeze bottles. This is a nice place in a nice area and can't have a decent soap dispenser is ridiculous. Add a changing table, real soap dispenser and more attentive staff/faster did delivery and you will be a 5 star easily. The food is so good that is what keeps me coming back. Grilled fish tacos amazing actually they are all good except the chicken tacos which is weird cause I love chicken everything. Green chili burger and Angus burger yum. If you are getting chips and salsa get the salsa flight, trust me. Pass on the garlic fries. Warning ketchup is spicy. Love their Moscow mules, they are served in Cooper mugs. Be prepared to surrender an ID for the copper mug.
