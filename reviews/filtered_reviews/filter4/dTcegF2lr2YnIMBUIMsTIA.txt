We sat at the bar and I had the shredded beef enchildas. Man, that was a lot of food. My husband had the pork tacos, so we traded bites of each others plates. I just loved all of it. Even the rice. The consistency was great, as well as whatever flavoring they add to it. A few nights after eating there, we stopped in for happy hour margaritas (only $4!), and I have to say, those were pretty damn good, too. I only wish we'd done a repeat dinner there instead of barfing up cash at Koi that night.
