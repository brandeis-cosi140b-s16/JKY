Happy hour after 9pm with 99 cent margaritas and half off appetizers is what brought us in to this restaurant after Glendale Glitters.  Waiter was an ass but warmed up to us after a bit. 

The flaming queso dip was again; not real cheese.  What is it with restaurant trying to pass off processed cheese food with spice and call it queso.  I would much rather pay more for the good stuff than order something like this crap.  

The rest of the meals and dishes were great.  Pretty over priced for what we got, but it was tasty.
