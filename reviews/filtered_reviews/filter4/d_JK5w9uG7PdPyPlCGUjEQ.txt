Tacos and beer!! It's that simple.

Located along Paradise Rd and a little past East Twain, Imperial Tacos and Beer is situated in a decent sized strip mall across from Marrakech. If you are local, it's where the old Firefly was located.

I'll start by saying this: Don't fill up on starters. The Guac crab and mango starter is great but is filing.

The tacos here are great, sampling variety from Crunchy to Baja Fish but the one the I can recommend is the Verde Pastor. Plenty of flavor with an interesting combo of ingredients. The servings are a little bigger than your regular street tacos so don't worry you won't be hungry later.

The beer selection is extensive. The menu has most of the beers broken down into simply categories that are easy to follow. If you want an updated beer menu check the blackboard beside the bar.

As for the service, our busser and host were awesome. The busser took our orders and recommend different tacos. The sever wasn't really around that much.

The hostess was amazing, she had a very extensive knowledge of beer and was amazing in recommending. Management better change her to the bar or someone is going to scoop her up!
