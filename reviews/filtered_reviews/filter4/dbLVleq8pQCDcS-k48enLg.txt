Yay, a hole-in-the-wall mexican joint that's vegetarian-friendly! 

My kid and I loved the (homemade?) horchata, sediment and all--even better that its served punchbowl (punchbucket?)-style. 

I had the bean and cheese burrito, served some special style with raw onions and Tapatio sauce inside. Tasty! Because we don't hit that area of town much and I didn't know when we'd be back, I tried the corn as well, with all the fixin's, that is, lime, cheese, cream(?) and Tapatio. Not really my taste, but it was the most elaborate corn-on-the-cob I've seen. 

My kid was happy with the bean burrito too, sans the onions and sauce. My wife had a quesadilla with grilled onions. It was a little small, but looked good and she seemed to like it. She loved one of their flavored margaritas, the maroon one with a funny name that starts with a j.

We also all shared the chips, salsa and guac. Not a fan of creamy guac, I stuck with the salsa, which i loved, but my wife, a guacamole connoisseur, really liked it. 

We'll be back...
