Had an early dinner here last week with a group of 6.  The orders ranged from a salad to a la carte items to full meals.  Everyone was very happy with their orders.  The salsa was very spicy but excellent (with an even spicier option available on the table).  The guacamole appetizer was large and fresh - excellent.  I had a beef tamale - one of the best I've had.  Good margaritas too.  The atmosphere is bright, very casual, and a bit touristy but the food makes up for it.
