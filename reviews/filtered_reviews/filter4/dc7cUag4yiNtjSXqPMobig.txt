ok, if you've been living in vegas, you've had to try this place at least once.  i was pretty skeptical at first.  it's not a pretty place.  it's not the cleanest place.  it's simple and just serves good mexican food.  its not healthy eater, so dieters beware.  the hot steaming crispy carnitas plate is so delicious.  the HUGUNGOUS nacho platter is full of chunks of meat and cheeeeze.  all the burritos are good with any of the meat choices.  this place is so damn good after a night out with mr jack daniels.  then you have to wash it down with a cold glass of horchata.  this place is hella cool b/c it has a condiment stand with cut cucumber, the canned jalapenos soaked in vinegar w/ carrots, cut radish, onions, cilantro, and cut lemons.  this is how i love to eat any of their dishes and how i recommend eating there.   basically sprinle your favorite heat (hot sauce), then squeeze some lemon juice, take a bite of the jalapeno and squeeze out the tangy vinegar on to whatever you eat like a taco, burrito, or even the nachos.  the flavors are just crazy in your mouth, but ho---ho  damn good.  there are so many roberto's in this city.  this particular one and all of them are one of the best hole in the walls in vegas.  i've been to a pt pub on nellis on the east side and it literally had a hole in the wall that connected to roberto's.  WOW,  i can drink beer and get some good-ass roberto's  food.  i was sad to find out that i did not have one down the street from me, but in due time there will be one....ha..ha...ha
