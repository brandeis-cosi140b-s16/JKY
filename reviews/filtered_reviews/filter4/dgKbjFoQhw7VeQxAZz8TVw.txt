I see there are loads of people that have had bad experiences. My only not so great opinion on any restaurant has to do with washrooms.  Please have more than two stalls if you're a place that can seat more than 100.  Brilliant unlimited chips and salsa and $5 buck shots on tuesdays. I'm just getting to my mexi reviews for the week, but I rather enjoyed this place. $3 buck tacos I'm sure they have a happy hour but I went down to Yard House for theirs. Cheers
