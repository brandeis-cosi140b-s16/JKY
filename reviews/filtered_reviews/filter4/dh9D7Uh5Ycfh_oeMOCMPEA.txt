Would have given them 3 1/2 - food was four star but service made them lose some.

Gracious hostess who sat us right away at a table near the bar.  Really lovely room and interesting, eclectic blend of Southwestern and other styles.  Lighting was very complimentary to all - gotta love that!

Good margaritas, delicious skirt steak tacos, the white bean pur√©e was fabulous as were the green beans.  And the pumpkin bread pudding was one of best desserts I've had in some time.

So what was wrong?  Service was so rushed I felt like there was a timer on the back of our chairs.  Message was loud and clear - hurry up and eat and get out!!!
