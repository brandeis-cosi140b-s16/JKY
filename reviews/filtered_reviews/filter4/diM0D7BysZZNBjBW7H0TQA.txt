I loved the atmosphere, music, and d√©cor! I enjoyed the Cucumber Serrano margarita. It was refreshing and had a little kick to it, but was not overpowering. I had the "Mix Tape" salad with papaya and prickly pear dressing, it was amazing! The service wasn't the best, but overall everyone was nice. I would eat at Joyride again!
