We went on a very busy Friday night.  Crazy busy, but a fun atmosphere, "real" people, and great energy.  We have an excellent margarita while waiting.  There's a local band playing music- and they are very good.

We are seated after about 35 minutes.  We are under speaker so the music is so loud we can't talk.  Service staff is very friendly and professional, but also very busy.  Excellent bread and olive dip is delivered.  

We order pork tacos and Pollo Poblano dinners.  Our food is prepared well.  Quality is excellent.  But our water glasses are empty for far too long, too often.  It was loud to a fault- likely a combo of acoustics, voices and speaker location.  I like me my loud music, but not so loud that I can't have a conversation at dinner.

The patrons as a whole appeared to be enjoying themselves.  There is a broad cross-section of people, variety of ages, ethnicities, friends, couples, groups, etc.  I enjoy a diverse crowd, and everyone was good-natured, which adds to the charm of this small and very busy restaurant.  Parking is tight but i've never experienced any damage in the back.  

 I've been a couple times before, and consistently experience a 4 or 5 rating experience.  This is the first time I've reviewed, and wish I could give a 5-star, but no-go.  

Yes I will return, but not during one of the busiest times of the week.  No reservations, so be prepared to wait.
