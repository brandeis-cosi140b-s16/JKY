My sister and I stopped in here for lunch because we wanted margaritas. Right off the bat, I loved the decor. It was fun and perfect for a couple girls wanting some drinks. We each ordered a regular margarita. Yummy. I also ordered another one that was pink; I think it might have been a raspberry margarita. I had to save it for after I finished my food because it tasted like that gum in the Zebra package I used to chew as a kid. Super sweet.

The food was pretty good. We order some dip; I can't recall if it was bean or cheese. The waitress warned us that it was pretty spicy, and she was right. But in a good way. I also ordered the enchiladas which were pretty darn good.

I do have to knock this place on a couple points, though. First, my sister's salad was weirdly salty; she couldn't even finish half of it. Second, the service really dropped off. It was great when we first walked in the door, but became nonexistent after the waitress brought our drinks.
