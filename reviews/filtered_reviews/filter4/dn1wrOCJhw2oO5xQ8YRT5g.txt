Very cheap and tasty food if you're looking for a quick Mexican meal on the Strip in Vegas. We both wanted Mexican, but weren't looking to break the bank on a fancier place. We found this little hole-in-the-wall and it was delicious! Our waiter was very nice and the portions were huge. I had the enchiladas and they were super yummy. I'd definitely come back to try one of the margaritas or bloody mary.
