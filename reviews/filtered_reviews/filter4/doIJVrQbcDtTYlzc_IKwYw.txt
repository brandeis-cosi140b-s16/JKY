I was a little afraid that this place was going to be a tourist trap with mediocre food, given it's location.  It was of course a tourist trap but it was also super super tasty.  I had the huevos rancheros (breakfast all day!!) it was so good I ate way beyond full.  They serve it with gauc and salsa, both were great, but totally unnecessary-the huevos were perfect as is. Oh, Oh, Oh! They made my eggs perfectly over medium.  I don't know if you've ever ordered over medium eggs before but it's quite the gamble.  Kudos to the cooks!
My partner in crime ordered the Nachos and walked out with a food baby as well.  He had some super tasty raspberry margarita which totally trumped my guava daiquiri.  

On a side note:
Our server was pretty much MIA during the meal but this was obviously due to the fact that she was in the weeds.  I think she may have been the only one on.  The food would definitely bring me back but not having anyone check on us until we were almost done eating would keep me away.  Hopefully it was a fluke and not standard practice!
