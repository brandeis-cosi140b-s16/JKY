Outstanding.  We waited a few minutes to get in and sampled a couple house speciality drinks that were very good. The patio area is quaint and comfortable. Food: we had the roasted corn, very tasty; guacamole, had bits of fruit that complemented the avocado;  the special was salmon that was very good. 

Overall very good food and service. We are on the patio.
