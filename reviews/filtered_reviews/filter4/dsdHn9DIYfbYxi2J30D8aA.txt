Los Dos Molinas has been THE dining destination of choice for cyclists headed to South Mountain. We would ride our bikes there in the morning on Sunday.... they would let us put our bikes safely inside in the back, and we would proceed to chow down on a magnificent fiery hot, carb filled, stick to your ribs meal that would fuel us for the long (and much slower) ride back.  I had my first taste of Huevos Rancheros at Los Dos Molinas..... and my first horchata.  Everything I have EVER eaten there has been wonderful.  It is truly an amazing place.
