It must be pretty bad when I know the down times of all the restaurants. I've been to the cantina when it was super packed, moderate, and empty. It's very cozy when it's empty.  But when it's packed, it's very refreshing to see.  I love their patio.  It reminds me of some patios in Brooklyn.
The chips and salsa obviously have heroin in them or something because I can't stop eating them.  I even found some in my pockets and still ate them. It was delectable.  

The tacos are pretty awesome.  I've only had the seitan and the huitlacoche.  Both very fresh flavors...AND they use corn tortillas.  Should I write more?  Not really, but  I will.  The tacos come with two layers of tortillas.  The secret is to leave one layer on the plate and eat you single layered taco over that.  Then MAYBE, depending on how messy you are, you may have another taco. I'm just sayin.

I refuse to click the Hipster ambience.  It's ridiculous.
