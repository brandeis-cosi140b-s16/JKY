I came to Cantina Laredo with my parents and was pleasantly surprised. I know that this is a chain restaurant so I was expecting a typical chain experience, but this was not the case. Our server was gracious, friendly, and accommodating.  The chips and salsa were warm and delicious, our food was served quickly, and our waiter was extremely friendly. I've gone back twice since I started this review in Jan 2014 (hehe) and have loved it every time. The margaritas (house or non) are great. A great place to come for dates, family time, etc.
