Yes, they are great at Happy Hour, with their margaritas and taco plates and endless chips and salsa, but I also came in for dinner with a friend, and they were super friendly, prompt, and in my favorite setting for Mexican food in the Valley. Yes, it's about a mile from my house, so love the Civic Center location as well. I trust a place that's been operating continuously for like, 65 years, as well (unheard of nowadays!). Fantastic ambiance, service, and food--thanks, Los Olivos!
