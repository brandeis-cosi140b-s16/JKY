We went here on Easter Sunday and we were able to get a table with no reservation. We sat right by the water and listened to live music. The only option was the Easter buffet, which my mom really wanted, yikes. It was good food, nit the most amazing, but what more can you ask out of a buffet? The atmosphere was great. My kids liked it. The margaritas were good.
