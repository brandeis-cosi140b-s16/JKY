America's Taco Shop knows how to make some darn good carne asada. You can't go wrong here if you order anything with carne asada. They recently started offering chicken too. The bean and cheese burrito is delicious if you're looking for a meatless option. Daily specials, reasonable prices, and a good happy hour. My only complaint is that the tortilla chips aren't very good--often taste a little stale. If you get them, make sure to get the spicy salsa. It's not that spicy and it's a big improvement over the regular salsa. The "cochata"--coffee + Horchata--is awesome!
