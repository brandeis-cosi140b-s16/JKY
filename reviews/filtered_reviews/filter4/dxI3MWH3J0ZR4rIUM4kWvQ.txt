Well worth the trip to Phoenix if you live elsewhere in the valley. We ordered several items to put'em to the test and everything was delish with the exception of the shrimp cocktail which was flavorless and watery, but the shrimp was good. We're from Chicago where authentic food is hard to compete with but Mariscos Playa Hermosa held its own. Thanks to Yelp we found this great place!
