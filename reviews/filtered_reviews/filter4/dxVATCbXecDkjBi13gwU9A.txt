I don't usually take pictures of food but this was pretty awesome for a fast food joint.  The food was served on dishes and the portions were huge! The tortilla soup was really good as well as the carnitas taco!  I docked one star because I didn't care too much for their beans and rice, they weren't bad, I'm just too picky! I loved the decor and they were playing all my favorite Spanish songs, I didn't want to leave!
