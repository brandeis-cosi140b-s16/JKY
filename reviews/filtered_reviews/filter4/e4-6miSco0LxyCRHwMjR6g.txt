Long overdue review. 

KIMCHI FRIED RICE IS A MUST!!!! ANYTHING with the kimchi is good.

We ordered a couple of other dishes like the kimchi burrito, nachos, fish tacos, sandwiches. They're just OK. 

The place is small, service is quick with a smile. Since all the food is made to order, prepare to wait a bit.
