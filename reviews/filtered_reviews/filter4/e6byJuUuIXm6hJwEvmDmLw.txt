Great food, friendly service and a happy festive atmosphere.  Slightly higher priced, but the lunch specials are a good value.  I love the Chicken Taco Salad and the Pollo Rebecca, a chicken breast dish with cactus - an unusual but tasty choice.  Very excellent customer service and mariachis on Friday and Saturday nights, which we were surprised and my Mom thoroughly enjoyed.
