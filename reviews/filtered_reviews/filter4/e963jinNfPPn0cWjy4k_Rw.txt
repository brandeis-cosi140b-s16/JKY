First some perspective: I'm comparing this to the garbage that passes for Mexican food in DC. 

We went there on the first night of our trip and found good food, attentive service and a nice ambience with lively music. 

The nacho chips came with a sample of three salsas with unique tastes. We ordered the appetizer sampler to get a taste of their little plates. 

The tacos were good, though what most people would consider to be fajitas. 

My pet peeve: at a restaurant where the per person price is $40-$50, they charge extra for cheese ($2.50), lettuce ($1.50) and sour cream. We were asked about these sides for our tacos, without any notice that such basics cost extra.
