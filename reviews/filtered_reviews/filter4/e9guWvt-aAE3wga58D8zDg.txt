Clase, lo dice:

Buenos Dias.

Me llamo Daniela.

Como esta usted.

Quiero comer en Azteca.

Quiero comer en Azteca todos los dias.

Okay, maybe not todos los dias because I would be as big as una casa but frequently. I am a seafood enchilada junkie and they are not a common in charlotte as I would have thought. Azteca serves up a mighty delicioso set of two Enchiladas de Camaron with an 18-wheeler's worth of rice and beans (the tasty ones, not the ones that taste can-y). Add the standard basket of chips and salsa, but with pico de galo and additional hot salsa (you may have to ask) and complimentary sopapillas and you are bound to be both happy and unbuttoning sus pantalones when you leave.

Does it have a hint of standard American Mexican restaurant to it? Si. But its tasty and satisfying.
