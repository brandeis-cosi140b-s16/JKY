I feel like it's hard to find a reasonable, decent restaurant on the strip--not mention get reservations--so I was pleasantly surprised when we walked into Isla at 9pm on a Saturday and they told me they could seat us (party of 4) in 45 minutes.

I am realizing I can't tell you much about the atmosphere because I think I was too hungry and focused on the menu to notice. But, the chips and trio of salsas were delicious and the guac was pretty good, too. 

3 of us ordered the tacos -- 3 to an order -- and they were delicious. I had the shrimp which indicated it was fried on the menu, but it was so lightly breaded you could hardly tell. The sweet sauce with a semi-salty slaw topping ... well, my mouth is watering. A friend ordered the pork tacos and loved them, and I think the chicken ones were just OK. We also ordered the flautas which were disappointing (no taste, really), as was the queso fundido (explained as a "three-cheese meltdown" on the menu -- boring). 

All in all, very good meal for the price ... 4 entrees + 2 coronas = $80. Which was no big deal since the 45 minute wait was just enough time for me to double my money at the Roulette table.
