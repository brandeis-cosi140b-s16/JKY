I love this dos, at least every other week I have to come for happy hour out on the patio. Occasionally I've found myself here from happy hour to reverse happy hour. $2 pacificos and margaritas and $1 happy shots. The food is bar food nothing special but, I usually eat it anyway. I don't think I've ever gone here on a Friday or Saturday night but, I can say it's an awesome weekday spot.
