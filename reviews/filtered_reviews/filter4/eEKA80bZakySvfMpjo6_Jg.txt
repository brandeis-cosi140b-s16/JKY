My three tacos were solid!

After reading all the great reviews, I decided to stop by here after work the other night with the intention of getting tacos for that night's supper and a burrito to reheat for lunch the following day. In theory, it was a great decision.

Each of the three tacos I'd selected were awesome. I started with the crispy fish because I wanted to end my meal with the absolute best. Well, I could have eaten three of those fish tacos and been a very happy guy. The fish and shredded toppings worked perfectly together. Next up was the bacon taco. Yes, ladies and gents, they have a taco stuffed with BACON. I'll admit, after I heard they sold bacon tacos this place shot up to #1 on my must-try places. And it didn't disappoint. Simple, yet elegant, with just the right proportion of bacon to tortilla. We shared a sublime moment, that taco and I. But I must admit, the turkey mole taco took the other two tacos down like a kick between the legs. Figuratively. Combining crispy roasted turkey, bacon and pecans with their sweet mole was insanely delightful! It put the other two to shame, sort of. It was that good. So: Dinner was a smash!

The following day, I heated up the bean and cheese burrito in the toaster oven at work. While it was a good B&C burrito, I think I'll have to eat one fresh to truly know if it's really good or not. But it filled my belly, and I'll be returning to MMT when my next Mexican craving hits. Which should be soon. And I'll know that this food is meant to be eaten fresh, like all the ingredients already are.
