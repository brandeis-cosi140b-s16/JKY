Talk about quirky.  It's got it all.  The tasting bar is the way to go.  I think the veggie quesadilla is good. I also like the carnitas.  They even have cookies with your meal.  It's a place you have to try.  If you are into a fancy place this is not for you.  I happen to think good food can come fro some hole in the wall places.
