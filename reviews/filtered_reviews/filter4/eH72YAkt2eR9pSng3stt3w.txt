So first off, giving Sol a star for the food- they have good solid tacos.  Tried the carnitas, grilled fish, and breaded fish tacos, as well as the guacamole.  I would recommend all 4 items, and word on the street is that the ceviche does not suck at all.  

Giving 1 more star for the service... and the studly eyecandy (I'm talking about our 2 hot bartenders)  

Another star for the cool vibe and look of the place, awesome location in the Scottsdale Quarter.  Good for an after work happy hour, a hot date, or even lunch if you work in the area. Didn't have to wait for a table and there was even open seats at the bar.

One more star for the delicious margaritas and the five dollar off deal for checking in on Yelp!

Knocking off 1 star because happy hour ends at six p.m.  Boo, really?

And, lastly giving one more star because they do have a good taco Tuesday which goes on all evening, and consist of good deals on tacos and margaritas.  

Long live taco Tuesday's!!
