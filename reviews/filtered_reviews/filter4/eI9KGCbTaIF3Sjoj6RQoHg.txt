I love Cantina 1511! 

Complimentary Chips and Salsa: Wish the chips were less hard and more light and crispy. But they give you a generous portion of chips and salsa and the salsa is good.

Guacamole: Was everything I expected and more! The habanero peppers gave it a great kick, was impressed. Awesome.

Tacos: YUM. I couldn't decide which I liked better between the Asada, Chipotle Ancho Chicken, and Pulled Pork. Asada steak and pulled pork were definitely in the top. I was a bit skeptical of the pork and pineapple combo, but they know what they're doing here at the Cantina.

Barbacoa Entree: It was really good, although a little dry. I didn't notice much of the dryness because it came with a heaping portion of avocado and the beans and rice were addictive. Top that baby off with a sprinkle of the cheese and that explains why I feel super preggers right now. It was worth it... delish.

Nutella Pie: For $5.95 this is not bad because the portion is huge, but I wasn't really a fan. It was covered in more chocolate and caramel sauce than I cared for; I guess there is such thing as too much of a good thing. Also, it was a little too mushy. 

Overall this was a great experience and the food was good - the server filled up the water quick, came to check on us frequently, and was glad to split our bill. Plus, the damage was a mere $42 between 2 people for the 3 tacos, guac, Barbacoa, and pie!
