My partner saw the head chef on a local #LasVegas tv show and wanted to try it.

Since then we have been twice. Great meal both times!
I have had the shrimp diablo, bacon wrapped shrimp tossed in a spicy tomato sauce. YUM! Bacon and shrimp...come on people. Magic. Homemade guac! Delish! Pozole - Hell yessss! The only thing I have had here that I have not loved was the shrimp ceviche. Kinda meh. Everything else! perfect!
