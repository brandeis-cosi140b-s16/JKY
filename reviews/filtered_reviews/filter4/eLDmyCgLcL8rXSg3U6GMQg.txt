Food: Pretty good. Like others have suggested, we started off with the Happy Hour app's: Tejas Trio, street tacos, and shrimp pesto. Food came out within minutes even after our waiter said the kitchen was slammed and it might take a few more minutes. The guac tasted fresh and we all loved the queso (cheese dip). The shrimps were't chewy or over cooked, and the steak in the street tacos were tasty and tender. We also ended up getting one entree, the baja fish tacos. The fish again wasn't over-cooked or over battered. I'm not a big fan of the mango salsa - next time I'll ask for it on the side.

Drinks: We ordered the skinny margarita, not bad, especially during happy hour. 

Service: I think this part is were it shinned the most. We arrived early to our reservation and the host was happy to accommodate us. We have two small children and she offered the booth, which is perfect. She also gave the kids crayons and paper to help past the time. Our waiter, "Chaun" was awesome. He explained Z'Tejas and even said kids eat free tonight (Sunday's). He was also the one that mentioned that happy hour was about to end soon and that we should take advantage of it.  He was very polite and courteous. Always checked in with us and made sure our orders came out correct. He also checked if it were alright to slightly delay the fish taco order so the kids would have time to eat first.

I've read that the service can be hit or miss, but Chaun is solid. Ask for his area if you visit.
