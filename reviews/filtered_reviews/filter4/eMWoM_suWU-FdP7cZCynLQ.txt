Awesome place to hit up after a night out on the Strip. I'm from LA where there are taco trucks around every other corner, and I gotta say that Tacos El Gordo is just as good as the best of those. I came at about 3 am so it wasn't terribly crowded, although there was still a line at all of the different stations. I only had a chance to try out an al pastor taco and an asada taco but both were delicious. I think the best part was this green salsa-sauce that they put on the asada taco....no idea what it was unfortunately. Next time I'm back in Vegas, I'll definitely try to find an opportunity to come back and try some more of their food. Definitely a gem nestled at the edge of the Strip.
