First tried Nacho Daddy at last year's Life Is Beautiful Festival and have been coming back whenever we are on this side of town. The food is pretty good and the atmosphere is great. Had the cuban sandwich before, which was delish. Also have tried the enchilada nachos which were "ehh". This trip we enjoyed their hamburger nachos, which were way better... and also had the beef fajita salad. The salad was good.. but would have been a lot better with a different dressing. It came with a chimmichurri dressing... would be so much better with a cilantro ranch... or anything else. All in all it's always a good time here. Staff is great!!! 

I highly recommend our server Elicia- she is by far one of the best servers we've experienced here in town. She just brightens up the day!!!
