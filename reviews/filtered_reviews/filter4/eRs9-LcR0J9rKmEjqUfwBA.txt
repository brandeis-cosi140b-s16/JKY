Yesterday, I went in with my mum for lunch after having been here a couple times when I was younger.
Our waiter was prompt and took our drink orders. Mum got the Sangria Swirl, which she normally gets when we go in and is never disappointed, and I got a virgin Margarita (I'm not a fan of alcohol). Our waiter brought us our drinks and our chips and salsa. Truthfully, I do not understand why he warned me about the small little bowl he brought out that was "so spicy". Maybe it's just because I have murdered my taste buds with spicy food, but it was nice, with a peppery kick that was pleasant, but not spicy.
We both got the lunch chimi's (chicken of course). My mum is a big fan of their papas, which is sort of a mashed potato dish with peppers and cheese and I got the rice. 
Our chimis came out fast with a queso sauce and some red sauce on top. I was disappointed with the lack of sour cream or guacamole. I mean, I have never gotten a chimi that didn't have a side of at least one. I wasn't a fan of the filling, it wasn't awful, but it wasn't the best chimi I have ever had - it was too... soupy? I don't know, I like my chimis stuffed with chicken, not an overkill of sauce. It was nicely busy for Cinco De Mayo, and our waiter was prompt and friendly.
