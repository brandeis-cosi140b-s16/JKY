Wow, I can't believe our complete delight at finding this wonderful little bar/restaurant. The food was fabulous and the drinks were amazing!  We had the chicken, the small homemade tacos, the corn on the cob (outstanding and unbelievalbe) and again- the CREATIVE, yummy drinks!  For desert I got the french fries so I could indulge on more of the sauce.  So terrific and so relaxing.  

The only downside was the price and the service.  It's swamped on a Friday and the service was outstandingly kind, eager to please, warm and inviting...just busy.  And the prices were great for the food, but a tad on the high side for drinks. Of course, we had the house specialties! :-)
