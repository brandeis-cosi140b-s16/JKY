Having been here multiple times, we are not quite sure why we haven't written a review yet.  
   This is becoming a trusted standy by when we want a tasty meal,to be  taken care of by great people, served solid drinks, and enjoy a great atmosphere.
   I think they have the best house margarita around and the El Padre is another favorite of mine.  
   Don't think we have had the same meal twice since we started going.  Have enjoyed ever dish we have tried.  I had the fish tacos( perfectly done) and the mrs. enjoyed the shrimp fajitas on our last visit.  Try the Clams Corona...very tasty.  The short ribs are awesome also.

   All the normal Mexican fare is here, but so much tastier ( Tia's Enchiladas &modern burrito).  

Seems like it is pretty busy most of the time, but we seem to find a spot in the bar somewhere...that is the best place anyways!
