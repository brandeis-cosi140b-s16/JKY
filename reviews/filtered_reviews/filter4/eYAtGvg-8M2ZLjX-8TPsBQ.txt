I've was needing a couple of margeys and some delicious chips, along with some sibling hang time with the brothers. 

 We got there early (before 6) and were greeted warmly.    The drinks were tangy and cold and the chips showed up quickly.  Fresh, hot, salty chips were just delish.  Love the green tomatillo sauce but the other sauce seared my tongue.  I am no lightweight when it comes to spices but, holy cow, I had to give up!  

We ordered the corn and the guac and they were really fresh and yummy tasting....mixed together, they were just sublime.  I had the shrimp tacos, brother 1 had the veggie torta, and brother 2 had the polla asodo.  We had great service and, even with a very generous tip, made it out of there at about 23 bucks a person with drinks.

Some suggestions:  (I won't quibble about wait times...I know you're getting up and running).  Bring a variety of sauces to the table.  We all agreed that our food was kind of naked and this is a great opportunity to expose diners to more of your delicious recipes.  I didn't get any sauce on my tacos and distinctly remember that as being the best part!  

Expand the menu a bit to include more appetizers (sorry, but I just dig the Chicharron de Queso for the novelty alone).  The neighborhood is starting to fill up with Mexican joints so this will help you stay competitive.

Lastly, do a little sound dampening; you won't need much but this will help since it's heating up outside.

We'll all be back,I'm sure.  Smooches!
