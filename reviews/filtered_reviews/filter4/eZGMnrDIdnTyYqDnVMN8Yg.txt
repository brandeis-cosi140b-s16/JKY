On Sept 16th, we decided to try a new Mexican restaurant. This was our first time here and I gotta say we choose a good one....reasonable prices, friendly service,  good food, with large portions. The margaritas were awesome, made by James & Sean. Thanks guys for a fun dining experience. We will be back!
