I was really excited about trying this place because I love Fajitas. The service was okay, and the food was good too. But there was nothing really special. I probably would have enjoyed more if I would have actually ordered fajitas. But I got the fajita chimichanga with chicken. I would return to try more options. The margarita was good and so was desert!
