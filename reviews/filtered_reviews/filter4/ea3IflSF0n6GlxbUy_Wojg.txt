We've been to this place at least a dozen times and it has always been good. Kind of a cross between authentic ad Americanized Mexican, they have a large menu and everything is tasty. We often end up here during happy hour and get the nacho's. OMG are they good. One order can easily feed 3-4. Try it, you'll like it.
