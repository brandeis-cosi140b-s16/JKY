I will tell you exactly why this place is so great.

This place will blow your mind.  Not only is the service good, but the food is amazing.  

Here is the rub, your friends are drunk and they start babbling on about wanting to go to some Mexican food restaurant that inevitably ends in the letters ____berto's.  It does not matter which, they all are basically the same.  You go and get your gut injected with evil and then are forced to deal with that for 10-12 hours. Talk about regret. Don't do it.  Like a child of abuse, you have the power to stop the cycle.

Say "Nah" Like the famous sunglasses kid, "Let's go to Mi Patio and have some fantastic food, amazing service, and keep drinking to boot."  You will be a hero. You will make Ironman look like AquaMan (He's a Chump.  "You sir, command that fish into this taco."). 

Short list of amazing things to be had here:
1. Margaritas.
2. Mi Patio Taco. Not a taco and not a burrito. What is it?
3. The Chips and Salsa 
4. Chicken Tacos.  
5.  Ice Tea. 
6. Pacifico
