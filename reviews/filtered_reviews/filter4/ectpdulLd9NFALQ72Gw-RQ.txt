Short Story - 
Order the Smoked Marlin or Chicken Mole Tacos or a Quesa and enjoy the salsa bar.

Long Story -

You will be razzle dazzled by the ENORMOUS selection of salsas for you to try on the salsa bar. I think we were told seventeen but it might have been twenty. I tried the unusual creamy pecan salsa and a grilled vegetable salsa and whole lot of others that were very interesting.

One of the specialties of the house are the hand made Quesas. The Quesa was described as a quesadilla but seemed very different to me as I would describe it as a Mexican GINACOTTI or fried Calzone. We shared an all vegetable one stuffed with an assortment of vegetables including spinach and cheeses. It was very tasty and I like anybody would enjoy it. 

Out of the four tacos we tried the Smoked Marlin Taco and the Chicken Mole Taco were the best and the ones I'd recommend. The Smoked Marlin really tasted like Fish Tacos I had in Mexico. They were full flavored and dimensional with layers of cilantro and the right amount of smokiness and spice and that just right crunch. The Mole sauce from the chicken tacos was very well made and heavily coated the tender tasty dark meat chicken and was very good. 

Nothing was wrong with the beef or pork tacos but they seemed very average after the Smoked Marlin and the Chicken Mole.

The Quesa and the tacos were a very generous portion and more than we expected. I didn't think two tacos a person and a shared quesa would be that much food but it was.

Best tacos I had so far in Glendale.
