Today we had an office fiesta, thanks in part to America's Taco Shop. 

Some lessons learned, but overall the consensus was YUM. 

In the future we will order online and travel with a pick-up buddy (which is what we have to do for Pei Wei as well, but that's another review). Poor Jami went to pick up our orders by herself and had to park far away and walk in the 100-and-who-knows-what degree heat. 

I had the carne asada tacos, and I opted for the roasted jalapenos on top. These tacos were so delicious ..... You cannot go wrong with their carne asada. 

Everyone else also ooohed and ahhhed over their entrees. The chips and guacamole were also delicious. 

I cannot wait to get take out from here again.
