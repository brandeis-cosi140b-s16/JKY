We have been coming here for years. We used to drive across town to the original before they opened this one several years ago. 

Service is always attentive. Always refilling water, chips and salsa without needing to ask.

we always sit in the room to the right because my kids do not like the music in the other room.

We were two adults and  3 kids. My wife and I ordered the Gallo mojo de ajo which is chicken with garlic gravy. The gravy has chunks of garlic which I love.  the chicken here is pounded thin which I like as well. The flour tortillas are thin and excellent and are served with the dish.

One of our kids split with us and two ordered of the kids menu. 

we also ordered the table side Guacamole. They come to the table and make it right there. They ask how spicy you want it. it was good. 

If you order order a meal they bring a red soup with noodles is very tasty. 

The food came very quickly which was nice because we had our kids with us.

overall. it is a good solid restaurant.
