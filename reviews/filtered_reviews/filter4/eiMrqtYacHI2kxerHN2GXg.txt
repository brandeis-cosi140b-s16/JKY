I've heard about this place from pretty much all my friends at some point, so I decided to finally check it out. Super easy to find and the building has a fun, comfy atmosphere. There's not too much parking right near the restaurant, but plenty within walking distance.

We were greeted at the door by a friendly hostess and led to our table. The hostess immediately asked us if we wanted either cheese dip (which I've heard is amazing) or guacamole with our chips and salsa (including bean dip). Being that my friend and I don't respond well to dairy, we opted for the guac. The hostess informed us that it was extra, which we said was fine. Had I known it was almost $6 more, I think I would've said no... super yummy guac, but not worth an extra $6. My friend prefers her guac with more seasoning and additional ingredients, so she thought it was just ok. I love plain guac, so I thought it was delicious. The bean dip was just ok. But I've been spoiled by Leticia's (north side of town) AMAZING bean dip.

Our server was great and attentive. He recommended the piña colada and checked to see the ingredients for us. The piña colada was delicious and just a fun experience! Brought out in a pineapple instead of a glass! For my entrée, I had the one taco meal with carne asada meat. The taco meal was good, but not amazing. Came with beans and spanish rice.

Overall, fun experience and good (not amazing) food. I kind of left feeling like I could've gone to a Mexican fast food place near my house for more food and way cheaper. Or made the drive all the way to Leticia's. Would go again to try a different dish.
