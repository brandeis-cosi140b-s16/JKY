Read so much reviews of this joint that i recommended it to a couple of my friends and received great feedback from them, and i was determined to try it out.  I'm a fan of King Tacos in LA, a 24hr taco joint with great lengua among other stuff, and had not found a comparison in Vegas.

So i dropped by there last week and ordered a lengua, carne asada and of course the adobada tacos, chasing them all with an iced horchata.  Mucho delicioso is all i would say! Very entertaining as well to watch the guy carve up the adobada and dressing it up so colorful with pineapple, salsa and this creamy green sauce.  Do ask for the grilled jalapenos and green onions to bombify the tasty tacos! 

I have yet to try the very sinful looking carne asada fries, but since fries is my lil addiction i'll just bring a unsuspecting friend next time and get help trying the tasty treat.

I'm definitely a fan and will bring my friends there to cure their late night alcohol induced cravings~
