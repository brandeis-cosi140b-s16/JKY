Sort of mixed feelings here.. The food A+ but the service is a C- unless you get lucky I suppose. Went here while visiting Vegas for my birthday and must say the fish tacos are unreal. The sour cream, guac and some other sauce was dripping goodness everywhere.. Mmmmm..Also had a while pitcher of sangria...yum. The waiter was ok but seemed a little amiss. $81 later I was feeling good about the dinner and drinks for 2. Then 2 days later I took my wife there for her birthday and the first waitress abandoned us for a younger guy. Then after we ordered an app and beers he served everyone around us and never came back for me to order that encore platter of fish tacos. Needless to say we left with just the apps and I think I then lost the remaining lunch money on slots. Would probably try this place one more time because those fishy tacos are calling my name.
