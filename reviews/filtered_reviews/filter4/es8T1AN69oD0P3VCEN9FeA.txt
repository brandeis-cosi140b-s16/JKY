Great restaurant with a lot of delicious dishes. It is a more upscale mexican restaurant with small portions good for sharing with a group. We tried a ton of them when we went and I would say the following:

Tamales: absolutely incredible. Would get multiple orders next time
Tacos: mahi mahi and steak are very tasty. Chicken did not do too much for me
Carne en adobo: fantastic. Great flavor and the meat melts in your mouth
Huarache de hongos: great for vegetarians. Strong mushroom flavor
Pezole: not something I would get again but tasty pork belly
Guacamole: good if you use your check in but would get something else for $10 if not
