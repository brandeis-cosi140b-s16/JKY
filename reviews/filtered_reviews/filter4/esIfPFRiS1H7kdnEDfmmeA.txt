Pretty nice bar on Mill. There is a full bar on the inside, as well as the outside. On Fridays and weekends, the inside dance floor is so packed. There are two lines outside that are pretty long. The free line, which of course is super long; and the VIP line which is only like $5 to get in and is way faster so I suggest doing that.
