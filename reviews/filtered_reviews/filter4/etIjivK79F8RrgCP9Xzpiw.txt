This Mad Mex is a common stop for me. I enjoy their interesting dishes and I especially enjoy that many things (perhaps even most things) can be made either vegetarian or vegan. 

The food they serve is American Mexican food that often has interesting elements to it. It is more fresh and up-scale than the American style Mexican restaurants some of us may be used to. Also a bit more pricey, but price-wise I find it pretty reasonable. 10 to 15 or so for an entree. Drinks are fairly pricey, but not in context of the area. 

The dining area is large and crowded at times. As someone who has lived in the area my whole life, I fell in love with the oakland location of Mad Mex in high school. I was excited when this location was opening and happy for them having more and more locations. Comparatively this location is a lot bigger but slightly less endearingly funky. 

There is sidewalk seating and garage style doors in front, which are nice. Service varies, but is generally pretty good. They have student half price menu items in the early afternoons Monday through Thursday.
