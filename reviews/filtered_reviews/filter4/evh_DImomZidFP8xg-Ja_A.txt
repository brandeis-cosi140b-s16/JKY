We've been here twice now.  Both times my wife ordered pork and cheese enchiladas and I ordered the steak tacos.  Both were perfectly seasoned, perfectly done, fresh and delicious.  Excellent, fresh, high-quality ingredients!

I think this place gets a bad rap because it's a chain in a mall.  Despite that, this is excellent food! 

The salsa is the best we've ever had and the chips come out warm.  The salsa is incredible!  It's fresh and has delicious smoked peppers.  My wife doesn't even usually eat salsa, but neither of us can stop eating it.

Also, this is probably the only place I've been that gets the black beans right.  I love black beans and prefer them to pinto beans when I can get them done right, but most places undercook them; a lot of places just don't seem to understand that black beans take longer to cook than regular pinto beans.  Here, they are properly cooked.

I've had mixed experiences with the margaritas.  The first time they were perfect, but the second time they had too much ice and tasted watery.  As a former bartender at a locals joint in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where I made probably 200-300 frozen margaritas a night, I can tell you that the secret to a good margarita is all in the sour mix -- It has to be right, be fresh, and in the right proportion.  Few places get frozen margaritas right consistently, so I can forgive Chevy's getting it wrong one time.  When it comes to margaritas, forget all the hooey about fancy tequila brands, it's all about the quality of the sour mix and proper proportioning.

Service at Chevys has been decent.  Usually pretty young, inexperienced kids, but nice enough.  The experience is a little mall-ish, with kids and young military couples, but the food makes up for it.  

Really, it's the only good reason we have to go to the mall!
