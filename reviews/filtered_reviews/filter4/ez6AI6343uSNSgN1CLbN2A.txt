Our family really enjoys this place for breakfast.  We moved here from South Texas where Mexican food (Jalisco Style...not Tex Mex) is king.  Their chiquiles are amazing, and heuvos rancheros are good as well.  Surprisingly they also serve some of the best pancakes around!  Great Mexican coffee and hot chocolate.  Home made chips and tortillas are a must for us and theirs are great!  Also tried some tamales and really enjoyed them as well.  Only real disappointment was the sopapillas.   Too doughy, almost cakelike.  Not light and fluffy like we like.
