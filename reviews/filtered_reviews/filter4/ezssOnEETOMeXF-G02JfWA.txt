I was simply craving a fish taco when my husband recommend this new place he drove by the other day.  I love the food and cannot get enough. As such I am willing to pay $4 for a taco. The guacamole alone will keep you coming back night after night. 

I can not bring myself to eat inside as the facility is cramped and SO LOUD.  We always enjoy our visit on the patio.  I really enjoy the weekday staff, who are so professional and willing to help.
