I'm still trying to figure out how I lived seven-ish years in Ahwatukee, and somehow missed out on Los Taquitos! 

Came here a few weeks back with Yelpers Monica O., Cheryl B., Shannon E. and Rick N. for a lovely workday lunch. 

If it's your first visit, you absolutely MUST try the infamous street tacos. 

My first go, I tried the Carne Asada, Pollo, and Fish three taco meal with rice and beans. 

They were all delicious, but the Carne Asada was the star. Some of the best I've had in a long time. The spices worked well together, and no tough pieces were to be found. 

The Red Salsa they top everything with is nothing short of amazing. It's not blazing hot, but tastes great. 

I enjoyed it so much I dragged my Dude back out a Saturday that same week, where we discovered the Carnitas are right up there with the Carne Asada! 

Very tender, and it tasted like some type of apple and brown sugar rub was used. 

And again for another workday lunch when I got stuck on a client call and missed a vendor provided lunch.

This place is small and gets packed at high noon quickly.

Call it a dive; call it a dump. If you're coming here for ambiance (not delicious tacos), you're doing it wrong!

I look forward to trying other menu offerings at Los Taquitos, but for now, I'm hung up on those amazing street tacos.

Update 9/18: Tried the Bombero Burrito con Pollo. Do not order this if you hate spicy; also, it's massive (see photos) so SHARE. Barely ate half! Was able to sample the Vegetarian tacos, also delicious.
