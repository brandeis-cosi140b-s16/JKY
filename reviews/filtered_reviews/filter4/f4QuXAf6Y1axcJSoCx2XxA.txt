Supposed to go to Le Thai, but apparently most spots downtown are dark on Sundays....? So we settled on La Comida, right before our production @ the Smith's Center. And we came the first Sunday they were open, manager said it was actually pretty good business. So note to self: OPEN on SUNDAY FUNDAYS! 

Gerardo was our server and he was super helpful, hospitable, and patient with all of our annoying requests hahah poor guy! He made great recommendations, we tried pretty much everything he recommended. The Prickly Pear margarita and the Tamarind marg were pretty bomb.com + nice and strong! Our food was pretty good too.... I asked for vegetarian options and he brought me a separate menu. He recommended the Queso Fresco tacos for me and I'm not a huge cheese person at all but I really enjoyed these tacos, added avocado of course-- our meals came with family style rice + refried beans too, which were prob not vegetarian haha. 

We had to take off because of our show but I want to come back and do dessert! I saw they have plantains I think? I'm a sucker for some goooood platanos so I hope so! He was great, we hooked him up, we'll have to come back! They USED TO be on Open Table, wish they still were so I can get me some points!!!!!!!
