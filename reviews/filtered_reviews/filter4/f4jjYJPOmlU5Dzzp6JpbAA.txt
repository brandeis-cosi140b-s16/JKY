I came here for lunch and was so surprised it wasn't packed, based on all the great reviews on here.  But, it was a rainy day so that may have deterred some people from going out.

The prices here are a bit higher than you'd typically expect at a regular Mexican restaurant, but you have to keep in mind that you're ordering seafood and seafood in the desert ain't cheap.  (well, it's probably cheap at some places but it's also probably really gross at those places).  for the non-seafood entrees the prices were lower and more what you'd expect.

I ordered a fish taco entree that came with 3 tacos and beans and rice for only $8.99, so that's not bad at all.  The fish was fresh and tender and I really enjoyed the tacos.  However, I did not care for the complimentary fish ceviche tostada thing they served - the fish there tasted a little "off" to me.

I would definitely come here again!
