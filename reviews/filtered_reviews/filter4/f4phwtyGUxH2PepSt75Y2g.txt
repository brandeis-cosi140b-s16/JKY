My wife was craving mexican as soon as we got checked in at our hotel.  So thanks to Yelp we decided to check this place out bc it was close by. No waiting at all which was nice.  

We were suckered in with the 2 for 1 margaritas.  They weren't too bad but for $9 they should of been stronger and a little bigger.

The meals were fantastic.  My wife went with the chicken burrito and it was fresh and great tasting.  I went with the mahi mahi fish tacos, they were awesome as well.  We both got a side of beans with our meals.  They were good too.  I really can't complain about the food here.

Service was great and no issues.
