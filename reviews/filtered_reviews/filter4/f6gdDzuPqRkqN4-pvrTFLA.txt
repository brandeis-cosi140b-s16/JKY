I liked this place.  If I were to compare it to Chipotle I would say Cafe Rio wins.  I used to love Chipotle but its not the same these days.  When I walked into Cafe Rio I immediately liked the fact that it had a Mexican themed atmosphere that Chipotle lacks. They send your food through a toaster which adds a nice finish to their product.  The staff was friendly and my burrito was awesome.
