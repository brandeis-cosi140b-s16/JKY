Good tacos, but they're on the pricey side as far as taco prices go. The ordering system can be a little confusing if you've never been here before but watch everyone in front of you and you'll get the swing of it in no time. I really like to watch the guys that chop the meat and make the tacos do their thing, they know what they're doing!
