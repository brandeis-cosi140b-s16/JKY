I really enjoy the design of the restaurant- the colors, tiles, interior and exterior layout- its all very charming and fun.  The food is interesting- I had   soup made with beans and cheese, and it arrived in a yin yang pattern that was kinda cute.  While you wait for your meal they supply you with tasty chips (oily, but you know they are freshly made!) and tasty salsas to dip them in.  Service at lunchtime on a weekday was speedy enough, and the waitstaff were very friendly and helpful. I would gladly bring any of my friends here.
