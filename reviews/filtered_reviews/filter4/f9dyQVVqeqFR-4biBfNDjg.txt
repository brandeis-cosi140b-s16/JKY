My first trip to Via was about a year ago for a friend's birthday. I was kind of surprised that she chose this little place 45 minutes away from her home in Tempe, but immediately understood as I walked into the front door. 

It's kitschy-cute, loud, unpretentious, and STACKED with hundreds of different options of tequila. What's not to love?

The veggie-friendly menu is pretty awesome, too, and definitely a huge plus for a sit-down Mexican food restaurant. I've literally had cravings just for their rice alone. So good!

The house margaritas are something ridiculous like $2 or $3 a piece but are pretty syrupy sweet. I ask for half the syrup and a splash of ice water, and they're actually drinkable. 

This may not be a place you want to go to for a romantic date or a 'light' lunch, but it will be the place that resonates in the back of your mind anytime someone suggests grabbing Mexican food. Listen to that voice.
