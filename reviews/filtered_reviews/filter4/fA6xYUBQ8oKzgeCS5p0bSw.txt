I LOVE Arriba's food.  It's flavorful, plentiful, affordable and varied.  There are only a couple of Mexican food restaurants that I will go to (as a native Arizonan I have high standards for good Mexican food) and I think that Arriba's is just about as good as you can possibly get for a chain Mexican restaurant.  In my humble opinion it's a tad better than Garcia's, and FAR better than Macayo's.

The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is that the restaurant itself is starting to show its age around the edges and you can see the wear and tear in the decor itself.  I think it's time for the owners to shut it down for a day and do a massive floor to ceiling deep cleaning and give it some fresh paint.  Then they'll deserve 5 stars.  :)
