This is my parent's Mexican restaurant of choice. I can see why. The portions are huge and everything is hot, fresh and tasty. 

Husband and I shared the crab and shrimp enchiladas, although it was a tough decision to make. Everything looked tempting. The enchiladas were quite good and definitely big enough to share. We both have big appetites but had taken advantage of the chips and salsa and ordered a quest dip for the table. The queso was rich and cheesey, served with flour tortilla chips - although I preferred the corn chips and used those to dip. 

If in the area again I would like to try the pollo rico - I have a serious weakness for jalapeno cream cheese.
