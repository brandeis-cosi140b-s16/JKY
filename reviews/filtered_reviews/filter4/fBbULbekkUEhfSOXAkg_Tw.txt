I just visited this place on Valentines day with M, and was very pleased with the experience.

I'd never even heard of the place, and when she suggested it I looked it up online, found the website and decided it was a great idea.

The food is a New Mexican menu, complete with plenty of chilies in a lot of the dishes. The atmosphere on the outside look nothing what you experience inside. The bar looks comfy, and the patio (where we sat) is nice and intimate, plenty warm with the fireplace and heaters. The service was (mostly) attentive, only lacking at the point when we needed our server towards the end of our meal.

I had the Machaca & Tomatillo Chimichanga as my main course, M had the Portales Portobello Sandwich. Both were very good. The mushroom was a perfect tenderness, not too springy or chewy. The flavors were even, and the chipotle mayo a tad too spicy for M. My Chimi was tasty, the tortilla a nice combo of crunchy on the outside and chewy inside. The Machaca was flavorful and tender with a nice accent from the tomatillo. I was also impressed with the side dishes my meal came with. The rice was tender and light, with just the right amount of  slices and cheese (not too much of either). The black bean were cooked evenly and had a heat that comes up on you well after you've taken a bite.

I liked my experience, and look forward to going back again sometime.
