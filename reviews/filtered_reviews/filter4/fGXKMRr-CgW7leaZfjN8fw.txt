Stopped in with our kid because we didn't want to spend a fortune at one of the fancier Vegas places for dinner. Service was A+. Friendly hostess seated us quickly, server knew the menu and gave great advice on what to get and what to avoid. Fish and shrimp tacos were great, beans and rice basic (which I find to be the case at all Mexican restaurants). Margaritas were terrific. Will come back and recommend to others.
