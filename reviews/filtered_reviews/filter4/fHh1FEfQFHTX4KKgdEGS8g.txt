I really do like this place for brunch/lunch.  I went there with my sister, her bff and my bf and we all had a good experience.  The good is great and really flavorful.  The only problem that I have is sometimes the service is hit or miss.  It took a while for us to get served at the beginning but the food made up for it.  

I will return to try other items on the menu and to give the service a 2nd try!
