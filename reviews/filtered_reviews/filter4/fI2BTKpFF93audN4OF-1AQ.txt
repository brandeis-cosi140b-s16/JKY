French. Toast. Fries!  Amazing.  Worth every second of the wait and even the semi-odd customer base that was in the venue.  

This place has been bookmarked on my Yelp account for almost 4 months, and it's only a 5 minute drive from our place, so that's just sad really.  Now that we know how delicious the burgers are, we will be heading there more often!  

I had the Sloppy Joe on white toast any my fiancee had the Bacon Cheeseburger.  We ordered some regular fries and, of course, some of the much talked about French Toast Fries.  Both were delicious, but the french toast ones were amazingly decadent and tasted like a dessert.

All in all a great visit and we will be returning without doubt.

Overall: A
