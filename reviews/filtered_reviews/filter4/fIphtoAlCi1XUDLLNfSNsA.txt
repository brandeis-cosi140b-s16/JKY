Diablos is a great place to visit in Vegas. The drinks are good and the food is better. The guacamole is awesome and the nachos are great. Beware though the nachos are massive. No joke three people could split them. I split them with my gf and we could barely finish half. 

Try to find the girls handing out the free margaritas outside before going in.
