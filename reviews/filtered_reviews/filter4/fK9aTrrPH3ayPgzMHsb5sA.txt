Wow what a delicious burrito for the price. Im a Titanium Member at the Scottsdale Gun Club so I wondered by this place after shooting one day and ordered the Shredded Pork Burrito which I found to be loaded with flavor. The food is fresh and while the location is a little hard to find its worth it if you are looking for a good value and you love Carnitas or Fish Tacos.  The restaurant is small however the outdoor seating helps to accomadate the many folks who have heard about this little gem and keep returning much like myself.  I've been back a few times to try some of the other items and they are really good and most importantly fresh as well.  Recently, I visited for another round and the owner even remembered my name which was very impressive but most notable is that he really cares about the quality of food they put out here.  No hype just great food at fair prices.
