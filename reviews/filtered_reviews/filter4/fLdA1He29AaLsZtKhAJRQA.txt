I grew up in LA where hole in the wall taco shops were everywhere. Eating here reminds me of when I got out of school and all of us broke kids would pull our money together and buy as many tacos as we could afford. And although I've come a long way from that, I do still know where I came from. 

The menu is super simple. It's divided up into stations depending on what you want to order. You just tell them what you want and they make it right in front of you. Hot and fresh!!!! Like I said, get pineapples with the al pastor tacos. Mind f***ing blowing!! Meat is tender and melt in your mouth. And when you add the pineapple, salt and sweet together, boom!!!! You just can't eat at Roberto's anymore. The most I could eat right now is 4, but I'm sure when my appetite is back to where it was, I can scarf down 10 with no problems. 

Their condiment station is ridiculous. All the extras (cucumbers, radishes, carrots, etc) are always fresh and don't look like they've been sitting out for hours. There are multiple sauces to meet everyone's taste preferences! So good I came back the next day for seconds just to double check if it was really that good. And it was :)

Now here's my reason for the 4 stars and not 5. I ordered the Mexican corn (elote) and it was just eh. I'm used to the the guy honking the horn with his cart, walking the neighborhood streets in LA. That's my comparison and it didn't meet it. Even after the mayo, Parmesan cheese and chili powder, it was still bland. Guess I need to take a trip back to Inglewood just for the elote guy. Second, the line to pay can be a pain. You're standing there waiting and your food is getting cold. Boo!!! And the horchata is way to sweet. Had to add water to drink it. 

But that's enough of the negatives. That's not enough to make me stop coming here. Now I don't have to drive to the other side of town for good eats. Now get your butt up and get some! Did you not see my pictures?!?! GO!
