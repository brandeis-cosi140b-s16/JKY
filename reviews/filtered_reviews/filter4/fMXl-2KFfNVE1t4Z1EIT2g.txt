After reading many reviews of this fast food Mexican restaurant, I finally stopped by.  I normally like "Americanized" Mexican food with ground beef and the availability of french fries.  This is real Mexican food with all the titles in Spanish.  I had the best bean and cheese burrito I've ever had.  A simple item, but with the creamiest beans and melted cheese I will definately be back to sample a larger part of the menu.  The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is the unavailability of ground beef for us gringos.
