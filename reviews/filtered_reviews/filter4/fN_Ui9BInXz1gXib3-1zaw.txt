Had been wanting to try this place for years and fiinally got the chance last Sunday evening. We was very happy with the service and the food was GREAT! Salsa and chips awesome and so was our waitress. Food was served HOT and fast!  Loved sitting on the patio. Planning to go back again this next Friday to help a friend celebrate his birthday. Hope it's as good as it was last week! Not sure why there are so many negative reviews. We were very pleased!
