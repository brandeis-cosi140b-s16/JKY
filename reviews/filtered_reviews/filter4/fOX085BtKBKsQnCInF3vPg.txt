Being from NM and going to school where this restaurant started (las Cruces, NM) makes me a bit biased but this is a good overall NM place.

Hands down the best part is the salsas and chips they bring out before the meal. One red, one green chile enchilada sauce (warm), one sour cream chile/ jalapeno and one bean dip (warm).

Overall the other food is good with the typical NM fair, nothing outstanding but all good. I like the Gorditas plate.

Interior is Santa Fe style, kinda outdoor feel.
