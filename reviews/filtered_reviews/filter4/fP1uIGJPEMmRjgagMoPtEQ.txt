Let me preface my review by saying I have been eating here for the last 20 years. I remember coming to Sylvia's when it was just  a little counter operation inside an old gas station building with a tiny chip and salsa bar and like 7 tables. 

Since then they have expanded to this large restaurant style building which is fine I wish they would bring back the chip and salsa bar. (I always got the flour chips instead of the corn chips and now they make you pay for them, lame) But since they transitioned from ordering at the counter and sitting where you like. They now seat you and get your drinks, chips and food served to you from servers. The service is horrid. I probably come here a least a few times a month and the service has never been good. And the few times I have ordered food to go, no one ever seems like they know what they are doing and I find myself having to double check everything before I leave. 

However, the reason I keep coming back is that the food is excellent, it is one of my favorite mexican restaurants anywhere, not just in phoenix. I crave it all the time. I would recommend it to anyone, just don't expect much in the way of customer service. 

A little further ranting: I do not know what the owners are thinking, every time I go in there something is different or changed or painted or moved around. I was in there today and they built a children play area right in the main dining room so I had screaming children in the same room everyone else in trying to have conversation at their tables. Not a good idea, sorry. 

But in the end, I will keep coming back for the food, always.
