Huaraches offers a large variety of entrees and is extremely tasty for the price. This is definitely one of the top mexican restaurants in the Champaign-Urbana area, along with Maize. They give HUGE horchatas and I would definitely recommend getting one!

My only complaint is that it takes WAY too long to get your bill at the end of the meal. I can confirm this because I've eaten here multiple times. There is only one waiter who serves for an entire restaurant that's always packed, so be prepared to wait just as long as you did to get a seat to wait for your receipt. Dinner lengths here are double what they would be anywhere else simply because of this understaffing issue.
