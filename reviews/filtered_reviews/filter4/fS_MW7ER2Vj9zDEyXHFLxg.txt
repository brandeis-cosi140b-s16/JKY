One of our most favorite "dives".  Food is a unique fusion of Chinese, mexican, and jamaican.  Dont let the shopping center or the decor deter you as both are bit on the "rustic" side.
Definitely a "must try" if you are in Phoenix!j
Note to vegetarians and vegans-ask them to make you something and they will have a few suggestions for you.  The posted menu is pure carnivore.
