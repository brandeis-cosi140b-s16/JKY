After having to endure a nasty Mexican food restaurant in Anthem of which I will be gracious enough to not mention their name, Roberto's is a breath of fresh air. I love the fact that their food is authentic Mexican food and not what I refer to as "gringoized." 

They make everything fresh daily and the prices aren't to bad either. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone that lives or is up in Anthem.
