The homemade tortillas alone deserve four solid stars. This is a dive. I repeat, a dive. It's teeny tiny and it's only because of Yelp that we even knew it existed and then decided to actually walk inside. It was Cinco de Mayo and we felt the need to enjoy some authentic Mexican cuisine. We turned to the trustee Yelp mobile app, Tacos Jalisco popped up so we thought, "why not!? Yelpers approve, so it must be good." We pull up to this divey little hole in the wall Mexican food shop off a residential street. We walk inside and they have pictures of food on the walls with numbers next to each one. I decided to order the #10 which was a quesadilla and a taco and my husband ordered the #7 which was the Carne Asada. I definitely won in the ordering department and that typically never happens. 

My quesadilla was pretty tasty and the accompanying taco was small enough to provide a taste without filling me up too much. However, the thing that stands out the most is their tortillas. They are homemade, authentically Mexican tortillas. Large and in charge tortillas. Buttery and soft tortillas. The #7 Carne Asada comes with a whole lot of meat and then a large tortilla. The meat is tasty but it could have used some cheese so it might be worth it to ask for cheese to be added. The quesadilla was just as a quesadilla should be, cheesy and yummy. 

I would say that this place is definitely worth visiting if you are looking for some cheap, good Mexican food. It would be great if you are recovering from one to many drinks, or you're in the midst of having one too many drinks. It's also good on just a fatty day!
