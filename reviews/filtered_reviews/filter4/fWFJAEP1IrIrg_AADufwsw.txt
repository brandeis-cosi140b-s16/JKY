Finally decided to check this out recently. Great atmosphere, great food, and great drinks. I'm not sure what can be said that is not found in other reviews, but Rokerij is very good. It's a grill, so vegetarians might not find it too their liking, but others will enjoy their evening. If you're looking for a nice place to eat or drink, check it out.
