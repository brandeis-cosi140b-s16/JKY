This was not my first choice as i looked to yelp to find a in city mexican restaurant to take my friend visitig from seattle to but it was one of the few opened on monday . My next visit it will be the first place i choose this place rocks Great food and prices a great wait person who found out it was our first visit and gave us the skinny on all the dishes and be sure to ask for the salsa's, excellent guac, tuna tacos and pork tacos they also serve breakfast next on the agenda
