We came across this place because we used to drive to their sister location on Las Vegas Blvd. (Florida Cafe) and Havana Grill is closer to me. The appetizers are better at Florida Cafe but the main dishes here at Havana Grill are better. 

We always get the breaded steak w/ onions and the pork w/ onions. I never liked black beans until I had them from here. They are so good w/ the rice they have. I feel that its a little pricey for the type of food and atmosphere they have but that definitely will not stop me from going back. We went to one other Cuban food place off of either Flamingo or Trop and it wasn't as good as this place. 

Give it a try and I bet you wont be disappointed
