Overall great place for whatever you are in the mood for. Brunch is fantastic, order a mimosa or some coffee and sit on the patio and you wont' regret it! The guacamole is amazing probably the best in town.  Pork and shrimp tacos are to die for, hubby loves the Naco Torta. Happy hour drinks are pretty good, almost everything we tried was fantastic. Service can be a little slow but they try to make up for it with positive attitudes and refills, servers are always cheery and aim to please. One of my favorite places in town.
