I'm trying to think of anything I dislike about this place and I cant.  The guacamole the woman with the cart makes is great, the queso dip is great, all the food I've had is great.  My personal favorite is the "Dos Amigos" chicken and shrimp in a sour cream sauce oh my god and if you want to get the real deal ask for the handmade corn tortillas.  If I could eat here every day I probably would, and then I wouldnt fit through the door.

Also, I came here on my birthday and they brought me ice cream and sang me happy birthday while banging on drums.  Way better than red lobster.
