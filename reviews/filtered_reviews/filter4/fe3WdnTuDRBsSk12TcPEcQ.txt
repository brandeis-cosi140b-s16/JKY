Went for drinks and were asked if we wanted to sit at the bar; I replied if we can people watch from there. 
Hostess then said, Oh, we should put you on "the rail".
So, we sat at the rail, under the water mister, drank pricey (but not short on liquor) drinks,chatted, maybe even had a smooch?! and people watched, and watched the water show at the Bellagio.

Our waiter (Marco, Marcus?..tall guy with dark hair and accent) was speedy, attentive and polite...even when one request was only for some water! (he earned and received a good tip)

Someone came and took our "free postcard" picture...We may have purchased the "for pay" pic, if only she had posed us so we looked representable...not just aim and shoot!

We thought it was an hour+ well spent!!!!
