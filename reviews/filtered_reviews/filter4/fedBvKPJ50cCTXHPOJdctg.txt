All I have to say is where else can you get a scorpion in your shot of Petrone silver Julie and I have eaten here twice since we've moved to Vegas The first time was with Jason and Desiree unfortunately on that trip I forgot to take pictures Julie and I both had the filet mignon on nachos which were not only a ton of food but totally awesome The second time Julie and I went there for lunch she had a Barito that once again was a More than she could eat and came with all the fixings and I ordered the steak quesadillas Kim took care of us for lunch she did an excellent job took the time out of her day to make us feel welcome to our new city and BS with us a bit even though I knew that she had several tables in my opinion definitely go there for their nachos it's their calling card don't leave out the scorpion in your shot either
