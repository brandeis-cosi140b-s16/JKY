Since I been spending a fair amount of time in this area, I thought it would be good to know where the best local Mexican spots are at. The reviews alone would have been enough for me to try this place out but they also had a Yelp Deal, so I bought it and the next day, Abby and I were walking through the doors after a beautiful morning hike up Piewesta Peak. 

We were hella hungry and would have been satisfied with the dollar menu somewhere but with the Yelp Deal already purchased the night before it seemed perfect. So I ordered the Carne Asada Burrito and I think Abby got the Carne Asada Quesadilla platter. Both were amazing. I love their simple menu they have and there was enough leftovers to make a 2nd meal for us. 

The staff working were the nicest people and making sure we were taken care of. THIS is the reason why I love finding the local places over a Chipotle. Plus, we got a ton of fresh salsa, and you can taste the freshness with every bite in the food. 

Next mid morning hike we go on, this will be our stop afterwards fo sho.
