Great food!  The fries are to die for, delicious sweet/spicy flavor on them.  The milkshake (I had peanut butter and chocolate), awesome! The burger patty, alone is under seasoned and thin which is why I gave 4 stars.  However, in the burger, it's delicious!  I had the bbq burger, and added fried onions (which went perfectly on it). My only complaint on the burger as a whole, was not enough bbq sauce.  Great place, the man who took my order was patient, kind, and very knowledgable about the food.  The service felt a little slow, but it's cooked to order and at lunch they are busy, so I didn't mind.  The man who brought out my burger was nice, and checked back to make sure I didn't need anything as well.  Warning: Limited seating!
