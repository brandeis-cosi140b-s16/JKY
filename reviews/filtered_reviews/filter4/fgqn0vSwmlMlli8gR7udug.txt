This is a great neighborhood spot for some traditional Sonoran Mexican food.  I usually get the Blackened Chicken or shrimp burrito and it is always very consistent and good. They make all their own salsas and they are very good. The habanero sauce is their hottest and it has a good kick but nothing crazy hot. Good place and a good price.
