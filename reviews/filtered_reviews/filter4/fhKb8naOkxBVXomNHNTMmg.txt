So I was craving some good Mexican last night and some quality time with my best bud from HS.  We decided to try this place based on the recommendation of another long-time friend.  We decided to meet up at 5:30 and the place was already packed.  I was able to score a table outside on the patio....no frills but very pleasant.  Our waitress took the time to explain the menu to us, pointing out some of the more popular items and I told her of my quest for the perfect red sauce.  Best Bud arrived about one margarita in we commenced to catching up.  Chips were fresh and the salsa were both redolent with cilantro.  We shared a cheese crisp with hatch chiles on my half and it was really good.  Great tortilla and (of course) I adore cheese, so that was a good start.  We ordered entrees; my friend ordered the pollo fundido and I had a cheese enchilada with red sauce.  Now, we all know that I am on a perpetual quest for the perfect red sauce and bloody mary combo; I didn't have a bloody mary but the red sauce was good.  Not the best I've had but certainly up to snuff for a Phoenix native who NEEDS her Mexican fix from time to time.  So, to sum it up: nice casual ambiance, good (reasonably priced) food and drinks, friendly service, and a mellow group enjoying hanging out while waiting for a table adds up to a good time.  Put this one on your regular rotation.
