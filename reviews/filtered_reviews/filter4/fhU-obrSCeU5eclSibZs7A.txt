Came here because of the wait at bacchanal. Firstly the check in offer of free margarita was a pretty decent size. Not sure if it had sufficient amount of alcohol in it but tasted pretty good. The guac we ordered was fresh made and creamy and came with home made chips. I ordered the potato taco based on other reviewers and it was ok. I probably wouldn't order again but all my other friends thought it was yummy. My rice was on the toothsome side not sure if it's intentional or not but I prefer a full cooked rice. Tried my friends seafood ceviche and came as a pretty decent portion and it was pretty good. Also tried my friends fish tacos and it was interesting.. I think there was some cucumber in there instead of the typical slaw. My other friend got the shrimp dish. And that was good too and lots of big shrimp. Overall decent food and good service and price.
