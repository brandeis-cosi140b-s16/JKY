The brioche burger was sloppy to eat but it tasted delicious. I wasn't expecting the brown sugar toasted bun but it complimented the brioche cheese nicely. 



The location is in a dumpy strip mall but the service was nice and the food was great. I also had the sweet potato tots. They were very good with a little Siracha / ketchup mix.
