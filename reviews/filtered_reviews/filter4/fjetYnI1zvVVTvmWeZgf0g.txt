I'm quite happy to have stumbled onto Carolina's North for some really good Mexican eats. Is this place worth all the five stars I've seen? Nah, but for now it is a very solid 4 stars.

I had a chicken taco, a tamale and a chorizo with potato burrito and they tasted very good. This helped me overlook the things I'm not that keen about the place ... crazy atmosphere during busy times, dive-ish good looks and hard to get tables during the rush.

I'm sure to find my way back here whenever I'm in town! Really good cheap eats!
