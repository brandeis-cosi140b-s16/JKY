I have been here many times over the last few years and am finally getting around to a review. 

I love the free chips and salsas they offer. The chips are usually warm and the servers are pretty good about keeping everything full. Most everything I have tried has been pretty good to great except the fish tacos. They were just bad.. Bad fish, chewy and bland. 

The coupons Silverton offers is a bonus too. :)
