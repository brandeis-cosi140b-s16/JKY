Had family in town and we're planning on going to a late lunch at the buffet, but they were closed, due to it being in the middle of brunch and dinner. So Mi Casa being the closest place to there, we decided to go Mexican. 

Customer service was great, we were greeted, no more than 2 seconds after we got within the vicinity of the hostess. The waiter was quick and on point (pretty funny fella as well). 

The 3 salsas that came out with the chips were good, even the one that burned my mouth. 

I had the chicken chimichanga with red sauce on top. It was well prepared and a perfect size. Came with a side of rice and a small dish of beans, that weren't too shabby. 

I thought the prices were OK, maybe a little on the high side, but being that it is in a casino, it was tolerable. 

Will eat here again, for sure!!!
