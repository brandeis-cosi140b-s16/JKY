So I have to admit we were a bit confused pulling into the parking lot.  We actually meant to go to sister restaurant Richardson's but having never been there ended up in Rokerij via the back door through a kitchen area which was kinda weird. After our very friendly waitress explained things to us we stayed and are glad we did.  We all enjoyed our meals and the half price bottles of wine were a pleasant surprise.  I was very impressed at the number of wines on the list that were available at half price. The deal is good Sunday and Monday.  I ordered the Rokerij Burger and ordered it medium which is exactly how it was prepared.  I find many places cook it to beyond medium.  We will definitely return.
