Dine in experience 

The place was pretty much dead on a early Monday afternoon so it was much appreciated the devoted attention we received from our server Veronica. We let her know we were out of town and was welcoming and helpful with the menu. 

Ordered a Coctel Grande Campechana & a Carne Asada plate.

I can only go into detail regarding the Carne Asada plate seeing how this was my personal plate. The steak was tender and juicy (not dry at all). Beans & rice were good, nothing special but overall good. The Coctel was good according to my wife, not just full of juice like other places but a good amount of seafood in that cup 

Friendly staff & good food makes this place a sure place to return to. Thanks to Hector (manager) for making our visit a pleasant one
