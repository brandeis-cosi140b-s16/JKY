Came here for my 21st birthday dinner with my boyfriend. The both of us have been craving Mexican food so after doing some good research on yelp, El Dorado seemed like a great restaurant - which it was!! You walk in and the restaurant is beautiful. I love the walls and decorations, really sets the mood and ambiance. The service was great as well! Once we were seated we were given waters and bottomless chips and salsa (three kinds of salsa!) plus the chips were so fresh!! Because we both checked in on yelp we also used the buy on get one free margarita deal! Our server helped recommend great dishes. It was happy hour and so we got our appetizer half off. We chose the shrimp taquitos. Then for the main entrees we had the carne asada taco plate and the beef enchiladas plate, which both came with rice and beans. Then, for dessert we got the tres leches cake. Oh my goodness we were filled!! Everything tastes so fresh and yummy.

The only reason for the 4/5 stars is because it was so difficult for us to find! We kept going back and forth on Industrial continuously passing Sapphire Gentlemen's club until we FINALLY decided to pull up the the club's main entrance and found El Dorado Cantina literally attached to the strip club lol. We were a little surprised and thought it might end up being a tacky restaurant, but it definitely wasn't! Loved it!!
