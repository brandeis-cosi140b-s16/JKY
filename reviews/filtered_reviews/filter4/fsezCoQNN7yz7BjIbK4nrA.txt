I love the food at China Poblano and have to visit every time I'm in Vegas. The 20 Vegetable Fried Rice is absurdly amazing and I have never tasted anything comparable. At $19.88, it's one of the better values on the menu...The guacamole is worth the $15 as it is a huge bowl and delicious. The sticky rice/mango/crispy dessert is awesome. We request the same waitress, Christine, every time and she is wonderful and will recommend good dishes for the table. The only reason that China Poblano doesn't get 5 stars from me is due to the prices - like everyone else on here says, it's overpriced. My boyfriend and I managed to spend $115 on dinner for two with no alcohol and the dessert was a gift from Christine. It's expensive but crazy good food. I crave that fried rice!
