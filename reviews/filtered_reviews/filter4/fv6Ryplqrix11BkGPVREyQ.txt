Love Someburros. Great place to get cheap, tasty Mexican food that tastes authentic. This is the perfect place to swing by when you're in a hurry or want some take-out or want Mexican without paying to 'eat out'. My one complaint is they don't serve salsa, only hot sauce, (no bueno). They also have a decent selection of Mexican beers!
