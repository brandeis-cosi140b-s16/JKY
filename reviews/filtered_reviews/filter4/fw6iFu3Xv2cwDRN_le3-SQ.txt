My boyfriend and I love this restaurant. Typically, we split a meal because the portions are huge. 

Favorite appetizer (and the ONLY one in my opinion): Mini Tacos. 
My favorite dish: Carne Adovada (but I love this dish anywhere I go) 

The food is pretty much standard, good Mexican food, but the Mini Tacos rock my world. Don't order them if you are trying to be health-conscious. You will immediately regret your decision. 

Great for large parties, and they cater. SO YUMMY!
