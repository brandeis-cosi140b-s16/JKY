This is a fun spot! The house margaritas are good, and the guacamole is delicious! I'm a taco fan, and their beef tacos can be just want my frazzled mind thinks about following a really tough day. I love that the patio is incredibly dog friendly! I bring Edie here often, and they give us a bowl of water for her every time we sit at a table. The servers are very friendly and attentive. The patio is excellent, with a bocce court, outdoor bar, and sweet view of Piestewa Peak! My friends and I frequent this neighborhood joint regularly; the bonus is I can almost justify chewing down on their awesome chips and salsa with the walk there and back!
