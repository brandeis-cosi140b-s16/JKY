My fav mexican restaurant in Vegas. This service is very good, the servers are very attentive. from 2 to 5 Monday through Friday the happy hour is 2 for 1 margaritas and they have some of the best margaritas in town. Highly recommend the steak or chicken cognac. I always order the steak salad as well that never disappoints.
