The food was delicious and flavorful.  There's definitely a good variety for any pallet and while it's a bit pricey for each dish, I'd say it's worth it.  What I'd really like to give 5 stars and come back for is one of the newest "bus-boys", Hector.  He's is one of the most charming, interesting, and suave people I've ever had the privilege to encounter. Such a kind old gentlemen and he reminded me of an exact (however more refined) version of Kill Bill's father figure, Esteban Vihaio.  The interaction with him between meals is what left myself, and my friend, enchanted and buzzing from the experience of Leticia's.  I've been there a few times before, but I may find myself going back sooner just to interact with this sweet gentlemen.
