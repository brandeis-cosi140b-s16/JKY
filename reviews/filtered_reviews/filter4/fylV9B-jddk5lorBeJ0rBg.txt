Thanks to Groupon we found this place.  It's a nice Mexican joint in North Scottsdale.  Tucked away in the corner of the shopping center, there's no way I could've found it on my own.

After browsing the menu, I ordered:
Queso Crisp, $5
Monster Nachos, $10

The Queso Crisp was pretty good.  Kind of hard to screw up a Cheese Crisp, so I wasn't expecting anything less than good.  The Monster Nachos was very good.  I am a self-proclaimed Nacho-lover...and I'm a fan of their Nachos!

The service was so/so on the night we went...they were packed, so it was understandable.  Overall, pretty good experience.

**TIP** - the parking lot can get crazy packed on weekends, so park in the first spot you find.
