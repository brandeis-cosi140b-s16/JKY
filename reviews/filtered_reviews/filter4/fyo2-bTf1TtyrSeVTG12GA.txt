The food here is scrumptious, with an emphasis on seafood, south-of-the-border spiciness and some special touches from the chef. I highly recommend the green chile lobster dip as an appetizer--truly my favorite dip ever (the fresh fried flour tortilla chips don't hurt.) From there, it doesn't seem you can go wrong. Plenty of entr√©es to choose from, running the gamut from burgers to enchiladas to various fish. A couple of veg options. The green salsa is pitch-perfect. There are specials on the board when you walk in. I've always finished just full enough to not want dessert (though I could say I perpetually want sopapillas) but not needing to take home leftovers.

From the outside, the restaurant doesn't look very promising, with its shabby exterior, location next to a paint-ball club on a ghetto stretch of Country Club Road (though which part of this road isn't ghetto?). Inside, the ambiance changes to comfortable, well-lit and nicely decorated. Enter and it will be worth your while. (Only caution is to open both left and right taps at bathroom sink or risk getting scalded)

I've gone to this location twice and haven't ever had trouble getting seating for two. Likewise I've enjoyed good service. It seems there have been multiple reservation fiascos because they haven't figured out how to handle larger crowds, which is a pity. I have yet to try their Scottsdale location but will report on it soon.
