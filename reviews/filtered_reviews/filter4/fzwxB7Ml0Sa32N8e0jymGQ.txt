This place is completely different from any taco place ive been to. I love how you are able to creat the taco of ur dreams by adding the ingredients you want. I got a steak taco and a vampiro. Steak tacos were great, meat was nice, tender and juicy. They also have mexican Corn on the Cobb which is awesome!!! Portions are kinda small but then again thats why its not expensive. They serve alcohol and even have a happy hour. This place is pretty wide and open, plenty of seating & its two floors. Will be coming back!
