I loved this restaurant. I think that the fusion between Korean and Mexican food is incredible. I had  there a fusion burrito with the Korean Beef and it was huge once I received it we also ordered the fusion nachos with the Korean Beef. It was really good. I would highly recommend this place to any one. One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. The only thing that I wish they would change is to make there Mexican style salsa more spicier. But other than that this place rocks!
