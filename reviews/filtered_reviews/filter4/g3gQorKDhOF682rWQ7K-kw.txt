Padre's Modern Mexican is a new favorite of mine.  A waiter name Chico took great care of us and made good suggestions for menu items.  I ordered the Padre Margarita ($6).  It was served in a unique goblet.  Very nice.  My partner and I ordered the ceviche to start.  Cha Ching!!! It's a winner!  Delicious.  We ordered sopa (soup for you gringos).  It was a black bean soup.  The soup had a drizzle of cream and side fixings that consisted of cheese, cilantro, and onions.  The soup was very good and the side fixings made it fun and interesting.  Chico mentioned it twice that the Obama burrito was his favorite, so he sold me on it.  You go Chico!!!  You can choose from red or green sauce.  I chose the red and it had great flavor.  The rice and beans that came with it were awesome.

Happy Hour is Monday through Friday 3 - 6:30 for you festive peeps.

Padre's has a cute little patio but it was a little to hot.  Their website says Dining and Dancing.   Friday Night Salsa!!!  Fun.  I will be back for that.

Yay for Padre's.
