The reviews said it was a good burger, and that's what we got!  We came early Sunday mid morning and found the place empty.  We looked over the menu and placed our order for two burgers with fries. 

The burger is not huge, but the meat patty was thick, cooked perfectly and had great seasoning.  The burger was delicious.  I would love to try it again.
