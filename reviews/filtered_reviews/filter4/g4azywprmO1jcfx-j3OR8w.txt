Really good entrees. I would have given 5 stars, but the service was pretty slow and the chips were crappy. On the other hand, had it been faster I probably would have drank way too much! So they probably did me a favor. We had the skirt steak and shrimp and the 3-pack of salsas. The entrees were FANTASTIC. The corn / squash hash with the shrimp was amazing! They were a tiny bit stingy with the shrimp (only 4!) but I would order again, anyway. The chips seemed like they came out of a bag, which was disappointing, and 2 of the 3 salsas (tomatillo and avocado) were way too sweet (like tasted artificially sweetened, honestly). But the hot one was great and the chipotle salsa that comes with your meal is pretty good. The steak was good, too, but awkward to eat with a butter knife. Ha. Maybe a service issue. The very best thing about the place, in my opinion, is that you can sit on the patio and watch the never ending shit-show of Fremont Street flow past like a river. Best and most entertaining Friday night view for dinner EVER. Can't wait to go back.
