I was surprised to see such low reviews here because my experience was great. We had a late night and manage to get out on the strip just as most restaurants stopped serving breakfast (11 am). We were dying for some yummy breakfast since the day before we had the worst breakfast burritos known to man at Tacos and 'Ritas at the MGM Grand food court. We were happy to see this place served breakfast until 12. They also advertised a 3.95 special (eggs, potato, breakfast meat of choice) and 99 cent bloody Mary's. Everything was delicious. The only complaint was that my tortillas were a little dry. The home style potatoes were delicious and the bacon seemed to be higher quality then your average franchise diner.  

Our expectations were low because of the price, but it seemed like they blew them out of the water. I have no clue how good the rest of their food is, but you can't beat the breakfast for that price!
