I'll just echo what everyone else said. 

It's really good. 
The chicken is red. 
The skin is crispy and amazing and it's not greasy or fatty. 

The chicken is better than the beef (in my opinion). 

Pintos = very good. 
Marinated onions = crunchy and good in tacos. 
Corn tortillas = warm and soft

Get it to go, because you're not gonna find ambiance here, but the service was good. 

Warm, simple, cheap, delicious. Mmmm.
