Pretty good, if you are staying at MGM and it is convenient.  Otherwise, maybe not worth making a special trip.  Nice atmosphere, fountain.  Good service, friendly bartenders.  My spouse liked the Michalada -- beer and bloody mary spices/seasonings.  Refreshing and different.

Food is "upscale Mexican".. so are the prices.  More expensive than Mexican normally is.  But reasonable compared to many other Vegas eateries on the strip.

The chips and salsa you start with are awesome.. homemade and delicious.  Fabulous green salsa.  Nice flavored salts, but those were not needed with the chips.

Had a combo appetizer plate-- delicious!   Entrees we shared such as Tacos Carbon with Carne Res, Chicken in Mole sauce, and Enchiladas Suiza were excellent.

Time got away from us, and we had to go to "Ka".. waiter was great at rushing our order through, getting us the check quickly.

They even called our room the next day to tell us we had left our credit card behind and they had it.   Thanks!  Nice spot!
