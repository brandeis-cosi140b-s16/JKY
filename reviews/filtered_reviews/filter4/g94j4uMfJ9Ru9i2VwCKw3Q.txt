After hearing about Gallo Blanco for a while from foodie and chef friends, as well as Yelpers, we decided to give it a go last night as we were picking our son up at the airport later in the evening. We walked in and immediately liked the vibe and diversity in ages and types of people in the room. It immediately gave you a "you are welcome to come in and hang out" feel. We were greeted quickly by our server, Mary. Her slightly edgy look fits the urban scene but is quickly belied by her sweet nature. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and made some great suggestions. We started with Micheadas (BM style) and they were just right. The spice, the flavor of the fresh lime and the bloody mary with the beer was delish and many diners were ordering them. We had a mix of the street tacos- halibut, shrimp, carne asada and pork. Loved the carne asada. My hubby loved the shrimp but just wished there was more than one in it! The corn on the cob with cojita chesse and paprika, JUST STOP IT! It was so good and hubby doesn't normally eat corn but he loved it too. THE BEST! We will definitely be coming back! It was fun, the food was excellent and the service was personal and FUN!
