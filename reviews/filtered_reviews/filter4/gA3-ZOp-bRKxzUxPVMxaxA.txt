Amazing food. Took a while to get our food but when we did... It was so good. I got the Baja fish, crunchy, and dorado tacos and a house margarita on the rocks. They were on point, and the margarita definitely had a kick to it. I had to order another Baja fish taco because it was so good. Everything tasted super fresh! I would definitely recommend this place. They have great food and a fun atmosphere. I will definitely be back soon.
