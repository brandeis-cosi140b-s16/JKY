So i've tried this place two times now I feel like I can write how i truly feel. My 1st time I ordered the shrimp rancheros very good. The 2nd time I placed an order for delivery and ordered 2 carne asada tacos and 2 chicken and of course menudo for this very chilly rainy day. The menudo is great! My sister said that as well normally she adds limes or lemons and we both agree the flavor is wonderful wish it did have a little more meat though. The carne asada has alot of flavor chicken was good but not the best ive ever had . The time I did go in they were extremely nice and always checked on me for any needs. I will continue to get food here on occasions.  You definitely have a customer . Thanks for making my tummy full tonight
