What an incredible little hidden gem!  I have lived here for 10 years and been to Richardson's a number of times, but I never even knew that Dick's Hideaway was around the corner hidden away behind those beautiful bougainvillea's.  The dcor was warm and woody with a very nice rustic feel.   This little place has the all the charm of the guys working inside.  As cozy as it was, I immediately felt like I just walked into that place 'where everybody knows your name'.  My friend's and I met for breakfast.  High top wooden rustic table or belly up to the bar?  Very comfortable, either way.  I was expecting the typical two egg breakfast, but to my delightful surprise, they have their own spin on breakfast.  Not sure if any of you had been to Richardson's (same owner AND same owner as Rokerij), but I swear they have the best red sauce on the planet.  I had 2 eggs, over medium, next to some rancho beans topped with a little bit of cheese, and some breakfast potatoes, ALL on top of a fresh flour tortilla.  The best part?  My eggs and beans were topped with their famous red sauce.  OH YEAH.  We were in heaven.  I think we have been there once a week ever since.  Highly recommended!  A +++
