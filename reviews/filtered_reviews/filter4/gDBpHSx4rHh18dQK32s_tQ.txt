I visited Vegas to party on the Strip, which became reclusive. I discovered Tacos and Beer on the recommendation of a local and I am so glad I ventured here. 

It's a late night, neighborhood gem that had music and patrons dancing on the patio. My friends and I made it just in time for their late night happy hour 11PM-2AM. Chicken quesadillas, Baja fish taco & queso fundido, and chicken/steak nachos were ordered. For happy hour, select tacos were on special, but we chose to partake in the $5 margarita deals + $3.50 bottled beers. The margaritas were ok, either too sweet or tart. No complaints on the food!

Cool vibes, nice decor, and nice atmosphere; I'd definitely visit again when I come to Vegas.
