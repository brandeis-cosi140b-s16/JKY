Amazing taste combinations - perfect marriage of exquisite handmade bbq pork buns (try the Golden Pig with a drizzle of condensed milk) and the savory Barbacoa de Res taco.  The Eastern Gin and Tonic was interesting but weak for $18 charge.  My margarita was good but also overpriced.  Compared to other dining in Cosmopolitan, this place was reasonably priced but still outrageous. If you are looking for less taste but better deals, try Holsteins next door (2nd floor)
