In Scottsdale for the week on business and had the opportunity to try The Mission. The guacamole is as good as advertised. The chips were just salty enough. The short rib tacos were small, but tasted excellent. Between the app and the tacos (3 to an order) I didn't have room for dessert. I wish I did though as the next table over was raving about the pumpkin bread pudding. I would have loved to try it. Service was very good (friendly, knowledgeable and made good recommendations) if a little slow (the place was busy early on a Thur evening).
