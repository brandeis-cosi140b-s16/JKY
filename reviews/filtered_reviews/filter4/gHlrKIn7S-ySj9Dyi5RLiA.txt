I came here for the reviews, I wanted a tamale for Christmas season, and it was close to the Pointe Hilton hotel we were staying at. 

Tamales were awesome, that green sauce is excellent with the right amount of heat. On the combo platter I had I felt the crispy beef taco was average, same goes for the rice and beans, but did not detract from the meal. My son had an enchilada in red sauce which was four-star worthy, my wife had a crispy chicken taco that was very good. 

All for a very reasonable price. If this were near our home, I would be eating here often. Thank you El Bravo.
