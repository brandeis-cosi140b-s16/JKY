My first experience at The Mission was awesome. Great food, fast service but it was pitch black in the restaurant, we had to use a flashlight to read the menu. My fiancé and I each got a couple margaritas, we split the table side guacamole then ended with the pork shoulder for two. We ate about half of the entrée due to filling up on  the guacamole. The guacamole is a must, it's easily the best I've ever had, plus it's fun watching it being made. The margaritas were just ok. The pork tacos were fantastic and a ton of food. We liked it so much, we made another reservation as we were leaving. This past weekend I took my fiancé, and future mother and sister in law. The food was good but the portion sizes were inconsistent with our first visit. Also, we paid 100 bucks for 4 drinks, table side guacamole and tacos for two. The food and decor is great. It's really tough to beat. The place is fairly small so you need to get a reservation well in advance, we made many attempts to get a table before we finally went.
