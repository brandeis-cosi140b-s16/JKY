Great little place to rest after a hot walk in Vegas! They have a patio with misters to beat the heat. Also their food was very delicious. I had one of the specials, it was good, can't pronounce it or even attempt to spell it, but it was good. The Jalapeño Picante margarita was amazing! Mangos, jalapeños, tequila, and spicy salt. Mmmmm.  Service was very good. Waiter was friendly and very helpful. I will be back for sure!
