The food here is very good, and the service is exceptional. We typically sit on the patio in Mario's section.  Their house margaritas are well-prepared and worth the cost. The queso fundido is extremely tasty, with fajita veggies in addition to the cheese and ground beef. They are very accommodating for special dietary requests.
