Wow. Flame grilled meat, wonderful flavors in the tacos. The salsas are all amazing as well, I suspect flame grilled veggies in the salsa. Very delicious. I like the reviewer who said it's like a stationary food truck, because that's exactly what it's like. You order a la carte at the counter. My chicken was dry, yes, but not inedible, and with the salsa I didn't even care, the flavor was amazing!!

I'll definitely go back and definitely recommend it to everyone else.

If you check in, you get free chips and salsa! Woot!!
