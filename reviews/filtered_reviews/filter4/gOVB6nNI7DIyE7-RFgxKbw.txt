Located in the beautiful Mandalay Bay Resort on the Las Vegas Strip, Border Grill has a bit of a history. It is opened by Chef Susan Feniger and Chef Mary Sue Milliken. Sounds familiar? Yep, they are indeed the chefs featured on Bravo's "Top Chef Masters"! Being huge Top Chef fans, how can we resist?

As with all restaurants in these large hotel/casino/resorts, Border Grill was tastefully decorated. In hindsight, I wished we sat on the patio, which supposedly overlooks Mandalay Bay's beach and pool.

We started with chips and salsa, as well as a good old Margarita.

We had the following dishes:

Oaxacan Strip Steak
- seared 16 ounce steak, mole colorado, charred wild mushroom quesadilla, avocado tomato relish

Yucatan Pork
- achiote pork slow roasted in banana leaves, caramelized onion, orange, cinnamon, honey lime yams, caramelized brussel sprouts, pineapple jicama salsa

The Yucatan Pork dish was quite tasty, although I was only able to have a few bites. 

Please come to my blog for my Vegas trip, I have food photos! ;)
