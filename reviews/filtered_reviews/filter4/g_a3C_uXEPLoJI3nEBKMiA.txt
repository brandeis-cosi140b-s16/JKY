I've been to Paz three times, and all three times have been exceptional. Great service and good food. I've only had a couple of tacos, the fish taco, carnitas, and carne asada. The fish taco was moist and it had this tartar type of sauce drizzled on top which was delicious! The carnitas, which I was a little apprehensive about getting was juicy and had a slight layer of fat which gave it some extra flavor. The carne asada was flavorful and delicious. Out of all the tacos the fish taco was my favorite! Love the decor of the place, the day of the dead paintings look like they are Lalo Cota's work which is a local artist! Over all I give it four big stars! I will be back!
