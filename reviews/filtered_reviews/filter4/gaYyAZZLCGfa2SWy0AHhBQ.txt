I usually don't write a review of an oft and well-reviewed restaurant, but felt compelled to key strokes for a few items on their fabulous menu that are missed in some of the reviews. Having been there a number of times since the first month they opened (I love the chef's Zinc Bistro too), I have alot of respect for a place that consistently delivers on food and ambiance. Does this place "try too hard"?  What the H does that mean? The waiters know the menu? Good. There is alot of wait staff? Good. They push drinks? No. 

If you haven't tried the Peruvian clam stew, for first course or even for lunch, you are missing a truly refined dish. The clams and chorizo in the light golden liquid are heavenly. The tortas, especially the brisket, are really flavorful. I have no arguements with those who expound the virtues of their pork and beef dishes at dinner. Try weekend brunch or lunch too.
