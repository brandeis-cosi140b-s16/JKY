Stopped by while visiting some family, on their recommendation, and was impressed.  I had the lunch special Pollo Amador and loved it.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauce was complex and flavorful.  Rice and beans were good, portion size was good for what you paid.  The dinner menu seemed expensive but I hear the portions are huge so that might be why.  Great view!
