I seriously have no idea how I missed this place for so long. I went to the Baskin Robbins that is next door to Richardson's probably every other week of my childhood, yet my parents never took us here. 

A month or so ago, a friend of mine was raving about this place in my former stomping grounds that I had never been to. Frankly, it was a little embarrassing. Especially when I finally did go there, and realized the food here is AMAZING. 

New Mexican Cuisine sounds a little intense but it is basically Southwestern, like Tex Mex only way, way, way better. The only detractor from this spot is that it is brutally smokey in there, which should be fixed come April with the new law that will hit. Once it does, it's five stars for Richardson's.
