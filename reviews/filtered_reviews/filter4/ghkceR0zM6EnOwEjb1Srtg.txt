Los Sombreros serves the Mexican delicacy Huitlacoche (Corn Smut in English...I know which language I prefer) which is pretty cool and something everyone should get the chance to try. The place is really cute so a meal out on the patio feels a little like a short trip over the border. The menu doesn't have a lot of options for vegetarians (me) but I still really enjoyed my meal & would come back, that's how much I like this place. My boyfriend & I had:

- Queso Fundido with Rajas: Delicious - good real cheese mixed with a lot of peppers & onions. I liked that there was some salsa (or a lot of cooking liquid from the peppers) mixed in with the cheese so it was a lighter fundido than just full on cheese.
- Guacamole: Love their guac. It's really chunky & really fresh.
- Huitlacoche Crepas: Such an interesting dish & totally unlike what I've had at other Mexican restaurants. The flavor of Huitlacoche is hard to describe - it's savory, a little like mushrooms, has a creamy texture. The flavor combination of the dish was very sweet & savory - savory huitlacoche with sweet pomegranate sauce and seeds with tart blue cheese, all wrapped in a soft crepe. 
- Carnitas: My boyfriend ordered this and said the meat was really good. The serving size is enough for 2 meals. The corn tortillas that came with it were really good and fresh. The mexican rice and refried beans that came with it were probably not vegetarian and were just average.

I noticed in the kitchen they cook over a wood-burning stove, which seemed rather authentic and must make their food that much better. The bar is outside & looks like a beach bar, adding to the fun atmosphere.
