I don't know why I was blindly judging Nacho Daddy, since the location opened on Eastern. Now that there is one in my hood- in the old Firefly location on Sahara- a friend, who's been a longtime fan, suggested we grab a bite there. I loved the ambiance... still very Firefly'y, which I always found sort of... sexy? The hosts & our waiter were very friendly. My friend knew a shocking amount of Nacho Daddy fun facts, which was kind of fun & made me feel more connected to it. We ordered the elote (corn), Vegan "steak" nachos then went carnivorous with 3 mix & match tacos to try (chicken breast, filet & fish). Everything was delicious! My friend even gobbled down the whole filet taco... without saving me a bite... it was that yummy. The huge plate of vegan nachos were totally not weird. The "steak" had steak flavor & tender texture... we scarfed the whole plate but, because it was vegan, we didn't feel weighed down. Our favorite, though, was the fish taco... with a creamy dallop of cole slaw & mango salsa... it will likely be my summer go-to. I've already dined there a 2nd time, but at the Eastern location... I prefer the Sahara ambiance & staff more but the food was just as good. There was an awful man flipping out on our waitress & then to another staff member & I thought they handled it like champs. Certainly better than I was about to!
