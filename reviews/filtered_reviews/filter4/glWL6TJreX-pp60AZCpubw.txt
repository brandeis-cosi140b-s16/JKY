My friend and I went in here on a Sunday afternoon to get some margaritas, which did not disappoint.  Unfortunately, they were only serving food off of the brunch menu and they closed at 5pm. I ordered a tamarind margarita because I don't like to stray too far from just a plain old cadillac and most of the other margaritas seemed fruity.  The tamarind margarita was so good!  It had just a little hint of spice but was very refreshing.  After two of those, I was good to go.  My friend ordered the pomegranite margarita, which I found too sweet, but it wasn't bad.  

We also ordered the shrimp ceviche.  When it came out, it looked questionable as it was completely green.  Like ninja turtle green. There was not one other color in that dish.  Anyway, upon my first bite, I realized its appearance was deceiving as it was bursting with flavor.  The green had to have been cilantro, and it surprisingly wasn't overpowering at all.  There was a wonderful balance of spiciness, cilantro, lime and extremely fresh-tasting shrimp.  I was very pleased.

The service was good too.  We sat at the bar so we got to chat with the bartender and barback a little bit.  They were both very friendly and helpful.  Can't wait to go back and try food off the real menu.  Be warned though, it is VERY expensive.  4 margaritas (okay, I admit!! They were double-shot margaritas!!!) and an order of shrimp ceviche came to about $80.
