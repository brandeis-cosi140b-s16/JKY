This is one of my favorite spots for Mexican food.  The service is always excellent and speedy.  This location has a great view of the strip too if your into that sort of thing (just kidding, I'm not heartless)  They usually have some kind of live music or performers playing during the evening so just be prepared for the noise factor.  There may be a wait but it moves pretty fast and it's worth it!  We miss Tex-Mex flavors and now that we've found Lindo we have a place to cure the hankerin!
