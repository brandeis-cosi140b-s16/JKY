Very nice ambiance for a Mexican Restaurant. Great selection of food and great tasting! Chips and salsa "Some of the best Salsa I've had." It has just the right amount of kick! The Cheese Queso is mouth watering. I love hot and spicy and this is where it's at!! Different, but just decent Tortilla Soup. I'm a very picky Tortilla Soup eater lol.
