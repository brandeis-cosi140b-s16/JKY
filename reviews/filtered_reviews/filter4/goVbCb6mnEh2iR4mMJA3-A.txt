So this is not a bad review, it's just a review from someone who lives in Dallas and eats Tex-Mex all the time. When we arrived, we had to be flagged into a parking space by one of their parking attendant (very nice feature) as the lot was very full. There was a 45 min. wait and lots of people waiting! We met a family who used to live in McAllen, Tx, and they raved about this place, so we decided to wait it out, esp. after all the other good Yelp reviews. It's in an interesting part of town, so it wasn't like there was another Mexican restaurant five min. away like at home. Hubs had the carne asada tacos and I had the combo #8. The beef was outstanding! Good flavor and charred to perfection!!! Large portions! The rest of the meal (beans, rice, tortillas, taco & guacamole) were good, but we're very, very spoiled Texans. If we lived here full-time, this would be our place definitely, but compared to home, this was a good, but nothing to 110% rave about. However, the service, mango margarita's and warm churro (soooooo good!) sundae allow us to overall give it the four star rating.
