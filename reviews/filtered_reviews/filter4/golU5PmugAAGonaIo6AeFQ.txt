What a great addition to Tempe. The negative reviews smell of jealousy or ??? I've been to the one in Scottsdale and this one is bigger and full of energy. The food is great and the tacos are done very well. I work in Tempe and lunch here was perfect. Six of us had lunch, the service was quick, co worker had ceviche and really enjoyed it. A fun place, tasty food and we got back to work on time? Give it a try, it's really good.
