A bookmark for far too long, I finally had the opportunity to dine at Mundo last Saturday night.  With a 6:00pm reservation, my date and I were seated immediately.  The restaurant has a classy, but relaxed vibe with most patrons probably having a pre-Smith Center-show meal, because it got a little empty at 7:00pm.  I was a little wary of how the service would be based on other Yelp reviews, but our waiter was very attentive throughout the meal.  We started with the sangria (refreshing), shared the chopped salad (nice and light) which was halved for us, and I had the shrimp tamale as my entree:  delicious!  We finished the meal with the chocolate Tres Leches cake which came with vanilla ice cream.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time there and will definitely return.  
BTW, it was my first time at the World Market Center itself, and there is some nice architecture going on there!
