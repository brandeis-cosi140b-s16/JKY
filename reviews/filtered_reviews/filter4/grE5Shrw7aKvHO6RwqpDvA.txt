We went to Joyride with some friends for Happy Hour on a Sunday afternoon.  Upward Projects does it again with this amazing place.  The layout and decor is done perfectly with no expense spared.  It is a fun joyful atmosphere that is lively by not too loud.  
Our waiter was very friendly and outgoing as he suggested drinks to our group.  I had the strawberry Aguas Freshcas with rum and my husband had the Mazatlan Mule.  We also shared the Better than Betty's chocolate dessert which was the perfect way to end Happy Hour.  I am sure we will be back for Happy Hour and maybe try out some more of the food next time too.
