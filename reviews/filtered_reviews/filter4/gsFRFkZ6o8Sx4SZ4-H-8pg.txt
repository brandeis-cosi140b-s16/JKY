Reminds me of my days in Long Beach Ca, hanging out at "Live Bait" ,  the shops and all the eat spots on 2nd street.  The service knew it's stuff about what to recommend and what to eat. We came for lunch and the food was reasonably priced and delicious! The ambiance was awesome. We decided we wanted to try to come during the evening hours to get our drink and food on and see it then. I will write a new review for the evening hours.
