Had the pork shank osso bucco.  Could have been more spivey but super flavorful and the green chili mashed potatoes were great plus a generous helping veges so the meal wasn't too heavy. Got to taste the green chili sauce and it wasn't to my liking for NM food. Red sauce was pretty good.  Service from the bartender (ate at the bar) was outstanding.  See why it made Scottsdale top 10.
