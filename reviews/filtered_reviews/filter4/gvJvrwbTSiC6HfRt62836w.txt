A local's hole in the wall but you don't come to Carlito's for the ambiance.   You come for the food and the $1 drafts / $3 marguaritas.   If you're gonna complain about the seating and lines, stay away.  We come here for the great food and drink at reasonable prices.   A real gem for Mexican in LV.
