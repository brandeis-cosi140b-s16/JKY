Like other Yelpers I recall seeing this place on Triple D and wanted to try but I am a North Phoenix resident who never makes it to the Tuke.  Good thing they took over the old San Gabriel or whatever the hell it was before.
I enjoyed the carne asada tacos, good salsa, good rice & beans though I can't say I was really feelin' the value factor as much as I would have liked.  I cleaned the plate and probably could have eaten more, though I did skip breakfast and ended up at Los Taquitos about 2 p.m. :)
I'll be seeing you again Los taquitos!
