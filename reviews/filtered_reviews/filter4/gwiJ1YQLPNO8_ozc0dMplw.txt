Ensalada cortada- nice mix of kale and greens with corn nuts. The small was quite small. 

The shrimp and verduras de temporada tacos are quite good; nice seasonings and mix of flavors although not the best I've ever had. 

I got the picoso cocktail by accident and that was delicious; I should have stuck with it instead of my original order of the pisco sour cocktail. While it was strong the pisco itself is only mediocre-tasting. I have had MUCH better @Raymi in NYC.  

There is also a new draft white wine on the menu called Tazi (I think). It is terrible, utterly terrible. Even our waitress spit it out in the bushes after tasting it! 

Otherwise great service and very cool interior decor and nice outdoor seating space.
