Ok, first time here for us here. We were greeted with fresh chips, salsa, retried bean dip and sopa de Fideo and two Free Margaritas for checking in! After another long day on the Vegas strip we worked up an appetite. I had a large shrimp and octopus cocktail that was pleasantly loaded with shrimp and octopus. The flavor was great! Same with the Asada. Service was very fast efficient and friendly. Really enjoyed this place
