Found this restaurant on a Yelp search...was in town for the weekend with a girlfriend and wanted good food, and fun atmosphere. 
The Mission was both!
We liked the cocktail choices, but asked if the bartender would make slight changes (vodka instead of tequila) and they were happy to oblige , and were delicious. Had a pineapple/mint with ginger combo...tasty with Vodka. 

We shared the table made guacamole which was good, not spectacular like some reviews here ...and we shared the pulled pork tacos for two. Yes the homemade tortillas are small (about 2 1/2 in. diameter) but there was plenty of the pork, and very delicious. Came with sides of roasted tomato salsa, a honey bar b que sause, onions and cilantro...the tortillas are kept warm on a warm block of salted rock..it was lit from underneath somehow. 
Creative and pretty presentation. 
Plenty of food for two women who didn't want to be stuffed. 
Waitress was sweet, helpful , pretty and smiled each time she spoke to us and served us. 
Bar and restaurant were full on a friday night with a younger, energetic crowd. 
Happy we went! Enjoy!
