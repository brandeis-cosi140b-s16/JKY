I've been to Macayo's....meh.  I like Ajo Al's better but service was a little spotty the last time I was there.  I have been looking for a go to Mexican place since I moved here over a year ago.  I found it!!! 
I love the atmosphere here.  It feels cozy and warm.  The service is the same way....warm and friendly.  Everyone was welcoming and accomadating.  

The chips were fresh and warm.  The salsa was nothing spectacular but it had a nice flavor.  My daughter was not feeling like mexican food so she had chicken fingers and fries and gave them a big thumbs up.  I had chicken fajitas.  They were tender and flavorful.  It was a good ratio of chicken and veggies too.  The fajitas were sizzling when served along with a second plate full of rice, beans and sides of sour cream, guac, and pico de gallo.  It was all great!  The beans had a nice layer of cheese on them and the rice was fluffy, although a tad bland.  Honestly I have not had fajitas like this in years!  They were awesome. My only complaint would be the tortillas.  They came wrapped in foil and they were a bit crispy on the edges....flour tortillas should be soft all around.  At $14 you get more than your moneys worth in my opinion.  I took over half my meal home because the portions are so generous.  

For you margarita lovers, they have a great selection of tequila and you can make your one with your favorite tequila.  The house margarita I had was a perfect compliment to the fajitas.  

Oh, and the fried ice cream.....omg!!  It was delish!!!  My daughter didn't want to share any but I got my spoon in there a few times.  

Now I find myself craving Nando's.  I will be back very soon!!!  Thank you Nando's!
