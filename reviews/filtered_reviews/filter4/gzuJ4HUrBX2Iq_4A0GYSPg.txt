My wife ordered the pozole and I got the scrumptious shrimp burrito that came with black beans and cilantro dyed rice.  My wife who is a pozole aficionado said her pozole was better than home made. Drinks I got the signature margarita that packed a punch with single shot of premier tequila. Felt great after that drink.
Chips came with fresh guacamole and salsa. Our service was serious not much of any smiles but he took our order with strict efficiency. Nice view of the gondolas passing under you and love the low noise level. Salsa is American style meaning it won't burn your tongue like the authentic Mexican hot salsa. Las Vegas style Mexican cuisine at its best.
