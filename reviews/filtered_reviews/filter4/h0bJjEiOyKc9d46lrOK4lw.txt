I am originally from Tucson, and this is easily my favorite Mexican restaurant.  While I still believe that the Tucson locations are better, this is still a pretty good representation.

I must warn everyone that this is NOT Sonoran-style mexican food, nor is it anything close to Tex-Mex.  This is Mexico City style cuisine, which is something that is hard to come by this far north.  Do yourself a favor and try something other than the dishes you are used to.  The mixed grill is a favorite (#39), as is the chicken melt (#34), and the pechuga suiza (like a chicken quesadilla) is to die for (#32).  My all-time favorite dish though is a combination plate, with two tacos and the pechuga suiza (#15).  The tortilla soup is also very good.

One problem that I have come across with this location is the service.  Multiple times I have been sat by the hostess and failed to be greeted by a server for 10-15 mins.

Other than that, I love this restaurant.  I grew up eating at the Tucson location, and it was the first place I would want to go to when I would come home from college during holidays.
