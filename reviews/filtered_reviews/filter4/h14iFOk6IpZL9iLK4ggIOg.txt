Don't be blindsided and miss this little awesome taco joint, it's in a little plaza in Paradise road. I love their simple name of "tacos and beer" and when you walk in this small restaurant, it is filled with great authentic decor and detail. Absolutely stunning interior design for a taco shop. 

Anyway, my boyfriend and I came to Tacos and Beer for Cinco de Mayo! Maybe it wasn't the best idea to come her for the first time on this day just because the service was so slow because of the crowd. But the food and drinks were great! We will definitely be back on a regular day and hopefully it's even better!
