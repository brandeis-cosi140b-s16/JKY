BOMB ASS TRIPE TACOS!

Ok everyone's all bla bla bla pastor tacos... bla bla adobada bla bla... whatever ya'll weak. TRIPE TACOS FOR LIFE! 

When those crispy buttery pieces of small intestine hits your lips...YAAAAAY! I mean... unless you're weak and can't handle your gut meat like a pro.... Next time I want to try the cabesa and lengua too... but the bf already thinks i'm part zombie with my tastebuds... 

They give you a side of grilled whole green onions (which is like the best thing on planet earth) and grilled whole peppers.... omg my mouth is watering. The fries looked really really really good... but alas, i'm "dieting" and i have to not order fries at all costs possible or else i eat them all. 

I'm only knocking off a star because their ordering system is just... how do i say... IDIOTIC. ok  first of all.... you have to get in line by meat options... so... i can't even.... like... WHAT!? what if i want like.... options... I dunno... luckily there was a few of us to split in line... but guess what... no one wants tripe tacos so that line is awesome short... by the time i finished eating my tacos.... my bf was bringing the pastor tacos and i got to do round two immediately! Ok anyways, you get in the line by taco meat... and then you go pay for them at another counter separately.... i really don't see what would stop a taco burglar from just getting in line... getting a bunch of tacos and then sitting down to eat them... but then again, you might get taco karma and only be subjected to gross tacos for the rest of your life or something.
