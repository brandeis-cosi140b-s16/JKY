Came in late into LV and was craving Mexican food. 

Lindo Michoacan has fairly authentic casual Mexican food, some of the better I have had in a long long time. 

Having been all over Mexico several times and specifically the opportunity to eat my way through Mexico City, I am generally very picky when it comes to Mexican food. 

We had the fresh guacamole, shrimp ceviche, tacos al pastor, and two tostadas chicken and chorizo. 

The guacamole was outstanding. Great balance of lime juice, spice, and onions with a perfect consistency. 

Tacos al pastor were also very good although not the most authentic I've had (close though). The pastor meat though was particularly delicious I was just not a fan of the way they used the pineapple (one big slice instead of shreds). 

Tostadas were probably the least impressive but by no means bad. 

All in all I highly recommend the place. Food is fresh and delicious with clearly high quality ingredients. To boot it's reasonably priced (for the quantity).
