My boss loves this place, and when he takes us out to lunch on Fridays, we end up here quite often. I personally prefer to sit in the bar area, they have specials during the lunch hour that you can only get if you sit there... like 3 tacos and a margarita for around $8! Richard is usually the bartender when we go in, and he is awesome! 

I love the complimentary bean dip they serve with their chips and salsa, and we always get the free plate of fried jalapenos and onions (not my thing but my coworkers devour them). 

This isn't the cheapest place in town to get a taco, nor is it the most authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas. However service is top notch, the margaritas are strong and the ambiance is pleasant.
