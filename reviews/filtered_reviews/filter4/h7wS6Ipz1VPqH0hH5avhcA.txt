Happy Hour (correct me if I'm wrong, it's been a while):
M-F 4-7pm
1/2 off most appetizers
2 for 1 Margaritas

The happy hour here is a steal.  Let me give you an example.. the appetizer platter is $7 after the discount.  It includes 2 chicken skewers, beef skewers, quesadillas, and tamales.  Along with the free chips and salsa, 2 people will be stuffed for slightly over what you'd pay at Taco Bell.  If you want to splurge, get 2 for 1 margaritas, and now you're stuffed and drunk.

The only bad part about the place is the happy hour is only in the bar, and it can be a fight for seats. Don't bring a group bigger than 4.  The service is always terribly slow to get helped by a waiter, so expect to be waiting awhile.  Once you order though, the food is up almost instantly.  Then you'll be waiting for your check the rest of the evening.  

As long as you set your service expectations low, and value expectations high, you can't beat it.
