Homemade frozen margs from sorbet and fantastic food should be top on your list for Old Town Scottsdale. 

Meeting a lunch date I arrived early and enjoyed a Cabernet and raspberry frozen margarita. I was unsure about that but after a sample was offered, I was sold. Outstanding! There's a small patio in front but I'll pass in the heat and enjoy the great indoors. Spicy Spanish music filled the air and we ordered.

Start with the fresh guacamole made table side to taste. I love it that way. The salsa was delicious as well. Requesting input from our very knowledgeable waiter, I went with his suggestion of a spicy brisket sandwich but warned it comes with slaw on top. I'm not afraid. Bring it on. Across the table a Chipotle Caesar was greatly enjoyed. 

While I was only there for lunch, I'll be sure to visit again for dinner. I have a feeling the nightlife at the bar is amazing.
