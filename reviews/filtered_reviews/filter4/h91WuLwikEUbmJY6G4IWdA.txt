The best Mexican food.  Period.  I've grown up with their original location in Springerville and this one is just as good.  Great to have wonderful tamales again!

My only complaint was with our server.  It was impossible to get her attention.  Half the time, if we wanted something, we had to ask another table's server or the bus boy.
