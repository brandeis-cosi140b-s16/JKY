To be clear, the food is 5 stars. Completely authentic, well seasoned, delicious tacos, served in two (count 'em, two!) corn tortillas. As a vegetarian (occasional pescetarian), I was skeptical of the vegetable/potato taco, but wow, was I wrong. No Tex-Med lettuce, cheddar cheese to screw up the perfect flavors. 

Only down-side, having to eat on someone else's front porch was less than ideal. It was cool finally finding the other latinos in the city, since 50% of the customers were clearly immigrant laborers having their weekend lunch out. I hadn't been able to use my Spanish since moving to Pittsburgh - problem solved! Don't worry, though, the two guys out front definitely speak English, too, it was just more fun for Carla and I to finally be able to speak Spanish somewhere. 

My only complaint - no fish tacos? I guess I'll have to go to Reyna's for that. But it's good to know I can grab a real (good) taco this close to work.
