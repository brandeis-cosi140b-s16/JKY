Really clean more modern looking place which is always a plus. They have pan dulce, flans, ice creams by the scoop as well as paletas and mangoneadas in addition to their regular menu items which consist of taco plates, burritos, tortas, soups of the day, nachos to name a few. I ordered the short rib tacos, pazole, cucumber agua fresca and a guava paleta. What I liked was that I can chose how well done I wanted the short ribs to be cooked! Medium please! Thanks! Everything was absolutely delicious! There's a tiny salsa bar. I really like the pickled onions from the bar and the fried yellow chile that came with our taco plate! I didn't even get a chance to take pictures cause I wanted to devour it fast! I really liked that there was a patio too with an umbrella for shade. Gonna go back for sure!
