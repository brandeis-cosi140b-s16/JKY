This place is so close to my home,  and before the twins, we used to be here at least once a week.  A couple of weeks ago, we had a moms night out.  We had a wonderful time.  Service was very prompt and attentive.  As soon as we got there, they set the basket full of chips and some salsa.  Those chips are dangerous.  Not only do they have the corn type, but also the flour one (yes, in all its fried goodness).  I have to really control myself and not eat the whole basket.  If you want a lighter choice, the Margarita Ceviche is a great option.  I ordered that one last time and it was fantastic.  I also had the top shelf margarita.  It was really good, my hubby likes "the boss", but that one is a little too strong for me.  Happy hour goes until 6:30 and the deal are awesome, 1/2 price appetizers and $5 margaritas.  I should come back more often.
