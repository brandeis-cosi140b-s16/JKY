Ah Tee Pee ... my family has been Tee Pee patrons for four generations now.  A city staple, Tee Pee has good Mexican fare and has been around for decades; visited by some of the nations better known population. 
And the fish tacos are amazing. 
Definitely worth trying if you haven't found yourself in one of their booths before.
