So here we are in historic downtown Gilbert enjoying the magnificent day, in other words not too hot ;0)
Lines for every place to eat... Don't want to wait 30 for lunch. Cruised cross street and found this gem! I live in So Cal but do not have a place this tasty! The steamed muscles were amazing, fresh and sauce was top notch. The calamari strips were wonderful, tender and crunchy batter was lite. Also had oysters on half shell. Not from the day but still lovely. The sauce needed some flavor but they supplies extra horseradish for mixing.plenty of parking in back. Some seating inside and plenty in back outside. I would frequent this establishment if didn't take me 6.5 hours to get too!
