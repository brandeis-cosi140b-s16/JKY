I stopped by here for the first time today and fell in love. This place is as close to authentic Mexican street food flavors as you can get in Tempe. 

While the menu limits you to two options (chicken or steak), the food flavor is so good you won't mind the limitations. The fresh salsa and the marinated onions remind me of home. They are absolutely delicious. The only thing that would make the food better would be an ice cold beer. 

As for price, I got the combo plate and a drink for less than ten dollars. It was more than enough food to fill me up. 

This is definitely going to be my go to place for Mexican flavors when I'm away from home.
