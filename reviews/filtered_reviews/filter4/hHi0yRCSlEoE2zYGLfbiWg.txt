Great homestyle Mexican food. If you like heat, order the pedazos, which are actually considered an appetizer but the serving is so big it can easily be shared. It's this delicious pulled beef/chile combo stuffed inside a giant,  cheesy quesadilla. Heaven. Eat it with the mexicali relish and it's game over. Its the only thing I order. Love the bean dip and chips, too. 

Service can be a little hectic,  but I've seen most of the waitstaff always just hustling and bustling all around so I think that's why, and I'm fair when taking that into account. Maybe add some staff to take the pressure off? Wait times suck during peak hours (Friday night, for example.)

It's certainly not gourmet but it hits *the* spot when you get that naughty-bad-for-you-good-for-the-soul-craving for Mexican food.
