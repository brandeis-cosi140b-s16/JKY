I really dig this place! The atmosphere is great - laid back, fun and just makes you feel relaxed... like the first sip of booze after a long day of work  : ) 

The prices are incredible for a place in South Park. Thanks for not price gouging because of your location, Chuy's!

The first time I stopped by I had the Chimy Chimy Bang Bang - quite tasty! The entree comes smothered in bang bang sauce whic is definitely worth asking for a side of even if you don't get this dish. And the jalapeno ranch - ask for a side with your tortilla chips. I'm actually not a fan of ranch (I think I'm the only person to ever say that) but this dip with a bit thicker. Creamier and a smooth, cool flavors. 

Awesome side note, go Monday thru Friday during the week between 4 and 7pm - free queso car! Complete with several salsas, yellow queso, black beans and ground beef. Yum!
