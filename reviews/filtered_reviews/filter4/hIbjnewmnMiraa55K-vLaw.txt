This place is convenient for lunch while shopping at Scottsdale Fashion Square.....because it is in Scottsdale Fashion Square....lol....can't get more convenient than that.

Seriously though....it has a nice atmosphere....you never have to wait (not so far anyway) the staff are friendly , the prices are reasonable and the food is good.

Recommendations include:

Grilled Cilantro Pesto Rubbed Ruby Trout - avocado, tomato relish, served with green chili rice and seasonal vegetables.

Jack's Five Cheese Macaroni and Achiote Chicken - made with bleu, Jack, cheddar, parmesan and romano cheeses, finished with toasted bacon gratin.

Hickory Burger - 8oz burger, house made hickory bbq sauce served with jack and cheddar cheese, onions, pickles, bacon and jalapeno mayonnaise. 

Seared Sesame Ahi Tuna - made with crushed blackened seasoning,  seared rare, topped with peppercorn vinaigrette, spicy soy mustard and wasabi.

They also have a nice cocktail and wine selection and often have some great specials. 

One definite highlight is their delicious cornbread which they bring out first....an awesome warmed, moist and fluffy treat!
