My husband and I had lunch at Cabo Wabo when we got tired of wandering around The Strip. The outdoor seating in the sunshine was definitely a huge draw. Still a bit chilly in the shade, but they had heat lamps. Bonus: there was a decent view of the Bellagio fountains. 

It may be a Mexican food chain, but I thought the food was fine. The service was great too. Friendly and attentive. Even though there were vegetarian options on the menu, we stuck to appetizers. The salsa had a smoky flavor, and the guacamole was good. We also shared a cheese crisp, which was similar to a cheese quesadilla. Overall, not the cheapest spot for food and drinks, but it is Vegas after all.
