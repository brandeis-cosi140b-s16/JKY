The service is inconsistent, but the food is always good - so I'm a fan. 

To elaborate, the menu is an interesting mix of Tex-mex Americana. They have enchiladas on the menu and right next to it a plain ol' burger! 

All their salads are great! And, I'm not a girl who "craves" salads. If I'm going to crave anything it will be peppered french fries. But, man, I crave the z-Tejas Jerk Chicken Salad. Slightly spicy grilled jerk-spiced chicken (spicy and jerked is redundant) with roma tomatoes, feta cheese, tortilla strips (which I omit), salad and a spicy creamy dressing (which I always have them put on the side).  If the description sounds to spicy for you, then try the Pecan Crusted Chicken Spinach Salad as it is awesome as well. 

Next time you are out on Ray Road or maybe coming back from Holiday shopping at Chandler Mall, stop by and try Z-Tejas. But for full disclosure, their service could be hit or miss. Ok- I've gotta run....I have a craving....
