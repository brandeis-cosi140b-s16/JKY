Ohh street tacos. So tiny and delicious. And that is definitely the case at this taco shop meets bar meets restaurant. 

I've been here a few times now and each time I have a new item that wins me over. To really put the staff to the test, I recently visited on National Taco Day ($1 tacos!?!). The staff seemed prepared for the rush and were their usual efficient and friendly selves.  The tacos are so tasty and even though to get a true variety you need to wait in a couple lines, the wait isn't too bad for any one item. The tacos al pastor are sweet with an addictive kick, my favorite by far. Ingredients taste fresh and if tacos aren't your thing you can pick the meat or veggie of your dreams and throw it in a burrito, quesadilla, on nachos...the possibilities are almost endless. 

Keep any eye out for specials not on the menu, usually on a tiny sign on the counter. Once advertised were the Mole Fries...my life will never be the same. Sweet potato fries, meat of your choice (get the chicken), mole sauce and cheese. I warned you....

They have a full bar but I usually can't resist the horchata. 4 stars only because I always find it to be HOT in there. I know there's good food cooking but crank up the AC a bit for us guests. So many cravings satisfied in one cozy venue, a must have.
