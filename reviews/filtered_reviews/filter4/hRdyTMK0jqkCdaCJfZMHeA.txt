I chose this place for a group of us to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday (as we had been to Maggiano's twice in the past month I wanted to find something new).  I was very surprised at how good it was.  They were extremely accommodating to a large group (15) and the food was great.  

While it is a little more upscale for a Mexican place there were some well price dishes.  The closest comparison for me is Z Tejas.  The combination plates they have are terrific value as I got two tasty enchiladas and a steak taco al carbon (rolled soft taco basically) for 12 bucks.  The margaritas (starting at $8) hit the spot and are even better if you upgrade the tequila to any from their large selection for just $2.  Well priced beers (for N. Scottsdale) at $4.  Guacamole ($7) tasted amazing and was a nice little treat to have it made fresh at the table.  The entrees ranged in price from $10 to $25 and had something for everybody.  

Very attentive service for such a large group (although towards the end they were a little overbearing as they wanted us to get the hell out).  

Highly recommend to anybody.  Will be nice when they open another one on the East Side of town (planned for Spring 08 in the San Tan Keirland wannabe)
