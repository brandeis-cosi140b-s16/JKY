I love this place; the owners are friendly and the burritos are excellent.
I recommend the pork Guedo burro; big and tasty; probably Chilpotle sized but better.

There's a small seating area indoors with humorous decor throughout; but you really want to be sitting outside.  Their pico de gallo has a ton of green chilis which is a good thing.

They don't take credit cards but do have an ATM inside.
Pina Coladas are great but only available Fri and Sat I believe.
