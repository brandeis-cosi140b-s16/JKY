Staying at the Cosmo, so naturally we turned to hotel restaurants first to cure our hunger. We got take-out from China Poblano twice -  decent food with good customer service. 

What we got:

Rainbow Congee. Amazing especially after a late night. Easy on the stomach and very flavorful thanks to the sausage (there are snowpeas and carrots in there too, so you've got your daily veggie instake). At $8.88, very cheap for five-star hotel restaurants and the serving size is quite large.

Carnitas & fried fish tacos. Tasty but rather small. Us girls easily consumed 3 tacos each and guys can probably do 5 no problem. At $5-6.50 per, that's quite expensive for just tacos. 

Caesar salad. Taste like Caesar salad everywhere else, but $12 for a very small serving. 

Nothing spectacular, but everything we had was well prepared and the takeout server was very friendly and helpful. The restaurant isn't very large so this is a great place to get some take-out for in-room dining.
