Came here for happy hour the other day with family before the asu basketball game. Yes I said asu even though I hate the devils.lol.

The happy hour menu was really good with $4 house margaritas which were really strong. We unlocked a penny shot upon checking in which was good as well. Ordered a variety of items including chicken skewers, steak tostadas, chips and salsa and pork tacos and carne asada tacos. All came out great and was more than enough food for the 4 of us. The service was a little slow at first but I think that was because the server was tied up with another group. After he came around he was great though. 

The scene was chill for happy hour with good music playing in the background. It was during the art festival so seating was slammed outside which would have been nice. We sat inside and had a good time though. 

I would come back here, especially for the pork tacos! They were my personal favorite. I've walked past here on a weekend night and saw that it gets packed! So if you go on a weekend night come early!
