This a small but good restaurant.  I enjoy coming here to have brunch with my friends.  When you get there on Sunday between 10 - 2 you are greeted by live music at the front of the restaurant and confining atmosphere.  So when you arrive expect to be sitting close to someone you don't know.  The wall are decorated by local artists that are trying to sell their work.  Once the waiter comes to your table he does his normal thing and then a small dish of salsa and basket of bread arrives so you and your friends can eat a little something while you wait.

The food is good but pricy, when you take your first bite every taste bud will be stimulated and you just want to take another bite to get that same rush.  I have only been to this restaurant for brunch so I am not sure what the dinner service is like.  During brunch it can take some time to be seated and get your order so don't go here expecting to get in and get out.  Sit back enjoy the music and have a good time with your friends.  I felt the wait was worth it.
