Why eat at a chain restaurant when you can eat here.  Food quality, and more importantly taste is far better than any chain food.  Price can't be beat.  For my money this is the best bean burrito in the world.  Strips with cheese and sauce are the way to do.  Red beef burrito is like something I haven't ate since the late 60s...in other words its good.  And did I mention price?
