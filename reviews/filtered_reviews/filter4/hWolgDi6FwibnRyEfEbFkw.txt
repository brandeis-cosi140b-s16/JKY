The service is top-notch and as far as Mexican restaurants go this is one of the better spots in Vegas. The decor is bright and fun with a cheerful atmosphere. 

They have an extensive menu with a nice selection of seafood. I've tried the orange roughy and the camarones a la diabla but my go-to is the red snapper. It's a whole fish served fried or in garlic sauce with rice, salad and french fires. You can sub for beans or veggies. I usually do, it just doesn't feel like fries are the best option for this meal.

The guac is good and they serve a habanero salsa with a nice kick. It's not the standard salsa that comes to the table with the chips and bean dip, but if you request it they are happy to comply. There are no taps at the bar and the bottle selection is limited. The beer is not the main attraction at this bar, it's all about the margarita.
