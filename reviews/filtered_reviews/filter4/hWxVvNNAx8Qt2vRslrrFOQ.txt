Outstanding weekend brunch!!  We had been drinking til wee hours and were on the fence about rolling out of bed at noon to do this. I am sure glad we did.  Eating on the outdoor patio is definitely where it's at.  Mandalay Bay still has one of the prettiest pools in town and you can even enjoy the outdoor concerts at night without buying a ticket fyi.

Initial thoughts glancing over the menu was that a group of chefs in a bong circle came up with all of it.  How else does one come up with a "bacon jalapeno peanut butter and jelly sandwich"?   That was surprisingly good and definitely hit the hangover spot but probably would've even tasted better at 4:20am for some I reckon.  The "short rib hash and egg" was another standout.  I felt like I could actually taste the negra modelo the beef was braised in but it was more likely my lingering beer breath.  I also can't say no to machaca ever and their chilaquiles were something I gladly had thirds of.  

Weekend brunches are getting more extravagent by the week on the strip and so are the prices.  $29.99 for all you can eat plus only $5 more for bottomless mimosas makes me feel like I got an amazing deal.  My only wish was that they ran this until 4pm instead of 2pm.  Gogogogogogo!!
