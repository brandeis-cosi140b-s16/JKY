I tend to romanticize Mexico.  It's a little strange I know, but I always feel that Mexico is one huge hacienda style restaurant on the beach just perfect for day drinking.  This is what El Encanto is to me.  What my preconceived notion of what Mexico should be like.  That may make me a backwards American hill billy but so be it.   

I enjoy El Encanto.  I do not get to make it up there as often as I would like since It is about 5 miles past ridiculously far, but when i am there I am always glad I went.  This is usually the place I take out of town guests from the East Coast or Midwest.  

The food is good.  I usually get the Queso Guillermo (How does my dictionary recognize Guillermo but not Queso?  That's gotta be fixed.)  It is basically boiling cheese with a few spices and some green onion.  You can add shallots and this beef that appears to be shredded beef that has either been dried or fried, and I strongly recommend that you do.  I have had the lamb, which is ridiculously good, the fish tacos, which are not deep fried as most other places are, and the pork, which is pork and I love pork.  I have yet to have anything there that was not delicious.  

My main problem with El Encanto happens to be their Margaritas.  You would expect that a great day drinking mexican spot would have great Margaritas right?  Wrong.  Too sweet, pre-made margarita mix.  This is easily remedied by ordering a shot of Don Julio and a Negra Modelo!

All in all definitely worth going to if you are in the area.  Make sure to laugh when your guest asks the waiter if they have fresh duck or turtle soup on the menu.  They will think they are wildly original and witty.
