Lunch here last week was great!  The server was very attentive, the chips were light and warm, the guacamole was delicious, and all four of us totally enjoyed our lunch!  I've been there once before & really enjoyed it, so when friends said "Mexican" I suggested Los Olivos.  I did think that the tamale was a little too "thick" but it was still very tasty. Two of us had margaritas and they were very good too!  I see someone posted a negative on the bathrooms but I went to the ladies room and it was immaculate.
