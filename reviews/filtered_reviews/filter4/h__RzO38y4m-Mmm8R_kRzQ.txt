Great atmosphere to go out with friends or a date. I loved the ambiance and the bar as the center of the restaurant. Ordered a skinny chola which was a basically a smooth and strong margarita...just the way I like it. The quest fundido was a little different, but I still scarfed it...puro queso! The street tacos I ordered were al pastor, green chile pork, and barrio pollo. The pollo was my fave, the green chile my least fave, but they were all yummy. Couldn't put my finger on it but they didn't blow me away. The obligatory salsa and chips was definitely better than other Mexican places as the salsa had some kick to it. Overall I will be going back just for the atmosphere and bar/restaurant option.
