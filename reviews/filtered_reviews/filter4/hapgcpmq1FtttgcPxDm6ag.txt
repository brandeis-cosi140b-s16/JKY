Aunt Chilada's is one of my favorite places to eat outdoors in Phoenix, when it's not cold, and when it's not 100 million gazillion degrees. 

They have rockin happy hour specials, great margaritas, and pretty good Mexican food. It's a little gringo, but it's yummy, and when my parents were buying, it was great! ( I ate here a lot in college).

I'm a fan of the chips and salsa, too.
