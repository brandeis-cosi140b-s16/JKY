I've been searching for a new "go-to" taco place since Los Parados on W. Sahara closed a while back.  Their al pastor was one of the best things I've had in LV and seeing the Yelp pics of Tacos El Gordo's adobada on the spit posted had me salivating in front of my laptop.  Must. Go. ASAP!

We ordered 4 adobada, 1 carne asada and 1 beef tongue.  We really liked everything except the tongue.  Maybe it was just our mood that day?  I was freaking starving so I was ready for more.  As soon as I'm about to speak to the guy manning the adobada, he grins and asks "How many more do you want?".  I'm sure this happens every 10 minutes there.

I got 2 more adobada along with a brain taco.  The guy automatically perked up when I ordered brain.  The person in charge of the internal organ taco dept went to work digging out some to chop up and put in a corn tortilla.  They also assumed it was my first time trying it.  They assumed right!

It wasn't bad although I didn't love it either.  It was like a beef pate with a lobstery taste to it.  Not ready to order another the next day but we're glad we tried one.     

I might be in the minority of reviewers eating here while sober.  I definitely see how this place would be even better when you're loaded like a freight train at 5am.  Certainly look forward to when I am here in that condition.
