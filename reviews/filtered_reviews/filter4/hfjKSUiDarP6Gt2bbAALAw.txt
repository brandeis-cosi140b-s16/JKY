This place was recommended to me and I went for early dinner. While there are only 11 tables in the restaurant, there was another couple there eating besides myself. 
The homemade salsa is great, but maybe a little too spicy as the jalapino bits stung my tongue. The waiter filled my water and beverage glass and brought me another round of salsa and chips. I thought the service was well paced, but he was a little pushy in getting me to get a pitcher of sangria to drink, I had to say no 3 times before he stopped. I'd rather make my mind up on what I wanted to drink instead of being told what I needed to order. After I said no to the sangria, it was the cucumber lemonade he wanted me to try. LOL
I appreciate suggestions, but please don't be pushy.
I had the chicken tacos with the beef enchilada and it was very good! I will be back!
