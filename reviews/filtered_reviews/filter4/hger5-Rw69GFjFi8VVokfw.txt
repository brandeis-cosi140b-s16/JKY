What make Some Burros is their hot sauce. What usually makes my friends and I crave Some Burros is their hot sauce. As with all Mexican restaurants, their hot sauces usually vary and some are different. I don't know how well I can explain their sauce other than it's red, it comes with your food, it has lots of pepper seeds, and it's just the right amount of hot. We go through a TON of it. I don't understand why they have a bean burrito, plain, you have to add cheese...but when you add the cheese...yummers. Their tortillas are nice and soft but thick and strong at the same time. When I ate meat, I discovered their Shredded Chicken and bean burrito. Holy cow! Most juicy and tender chicken ever...so delicious with beans and of course I added cheese. It seems like a crime to even put sauce on this particular burrito it's so good. The rice here is good. I usually don't eat crunchy tacos because of the oil and shell but they don't serve them soft here...and let me tell you...their shredded beef taco is yummer-ee-no! Enchiladas good, quesadilla good, chips and hot sauce, yeah yo. Overall, standard Taco shop prices, consistent food, good quality, hot sauce it great, and plus one for having a pick-up window for phone orders.
