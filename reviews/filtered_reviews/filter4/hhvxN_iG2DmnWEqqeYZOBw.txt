I love this restaurant!  The atmosphere is fun and the service is awesome.  I like how the Chef takes pride in his food and features new dishes and specials that aren't on the menu.  The firestarter margarita is AMAZING-infused tequila topped  with a jalepeno garnish.  They give you options for a variety of beans, rice and have the whole wheat tortilla available.  Great place for an all around great experience!
