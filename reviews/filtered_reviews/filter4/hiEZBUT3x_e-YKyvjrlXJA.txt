It's refreshing to find such great food so close to home. The service is always super friendly, with every staff member wearing a smile. I've been here for lunch, for dinner and for happy hour and can honestly say all were positive experiences. Expect a wait of you're going on a Friday or Saturday night, but it will be well worth it if you do. I've had the carnitas, enchiladas, taco salad, and the fajitas. Their fajitas have a sophisticated flair with the added mushrooms and rich yet fresh flavors. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the price... A little steep.
