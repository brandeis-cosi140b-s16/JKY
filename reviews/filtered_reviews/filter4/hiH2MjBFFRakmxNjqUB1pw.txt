So every Wednesday we pretty much go for their chicken tacos (99 cent tacos). Amazingly great! Giving 4 stars because of  the new guy at the front counter that was kind of rude. I hope he is just filling in for the other guy that used to work Wednesdays. Ive been to this location about 50 times and the customer service has always been great.  I hope this isnt the new change.
