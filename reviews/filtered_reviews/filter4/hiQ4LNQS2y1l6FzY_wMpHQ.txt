I come here every time I'm in Scottsdale, and I always get the same thing: smoked chicken chile rellenos. The chicken is clean and the smokey flavor is just the right intensity. The chile itself is cooked to perfection, but it still has the right amount of juice, and the delicious mix of nuts and apricots inside really takes it to the next level. Add all this together with a great cream sauce on top and you have one fantastic chile relleno. But be sure to bring a little extra green to Z'Tejas, it's a little on the pricier side but definitely worth it.
