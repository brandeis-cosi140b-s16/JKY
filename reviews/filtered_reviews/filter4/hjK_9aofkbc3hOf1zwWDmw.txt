HH is fantastic! $3 Margaritas are what Happy Hour should be about after all! They also offer select appetizers for $3 & $5. A few of my favorites include: tamale bites, red corn chicken taquitos, baja pizza, and large cheese crisp. I've heard the queso dips are pretty fabulous as well. 

You can get 1/2 pint of Baja sauce for $2.99 now! If you have ever had the pleasure of eating a Baja Chimi, you know that this is a marvelous announcement. I would swim in that stuff if I could. Though, that is probably highly unrecommended for numerous reasons and I bet it would take A LOT of sauce to fill up a whole pool. That being said, definitely make sure to try the Baja sauce if you have not already had the opportunity to do so. 

In my opinion, the best tables in the place are the booths by the windows. Don't forget to watch your step as you are walking up or down the stairs. This has become a bit of a joke between my friends but surely you'll receive the same warning. Just one more example of the great Macayo's customer service. Making sure I do not face plant in a crowded restaurant is rather high on my list so thank you. 

No matter when you dine you will receive unlimited chips and salsa and you will get plenty of drink refills. Typically, the food is out fast and pipping hot. On my last visit, food was out in under 10 mins! (We weren't even on our second bowl of chips yet). In the past few years, the menu has been adapting to various dietary needs so they offer gluten free items and (to my delight) calabacitas (their version has corn, zucchini, poblano pepper) have been added to the menu options as well. (Yay!)
