I love mexican food and was interested to try Isla. 
As TI started to change the format of their hotel and dining experiences from pirates to a more trendy atmosphere, I thought a "Mexican Fusion" restaurant would be a nice change. 
I was not disappointed
The decor is really nice and the food is very good, service is super.
I enjoyed the burrito ( which was just outstanding), but what I really enjoyed was the "goddess" tempting people into trying the major league - upscale $100.00 margarita. I  know that for most people, the fact that she prepares it at your table is worth the price. It is like having to go to a Faith Hill concert and watching her for 90 minutes - Yes - it is "tough duty"  - that most guys would repeat as often as possible.
Isla is very enjoyable and worth several repeat trips .....
