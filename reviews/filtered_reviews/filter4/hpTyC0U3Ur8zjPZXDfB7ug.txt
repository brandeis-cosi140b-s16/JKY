Yelp to the rescue.  Was on the way to the airport and had some time to kill....and needed some good grub.  Found this gem and glad I did.  How yummy and legit.  The finer points:

- No nachos on the menu (perhaps they'll make 'em if you ask...which I didn't).  I think nachos are the finest, most perfect food groupe on God's green earth
- Salsa bar!  And it's so, so, so yummy (careful with the "spicy"...bc it's actually spicy)
- Fish tacos use tilapia...which they break up - I think they should leave it whole
- So the BBQ steak -- it's YUM, actually BBQ flavor which is brilliant with the other flavors. 

Nice people and cool atmosphere.  WINNING.
