Two patios, one with a complimentary taco buffet on Fridays starting at 4 Pm. The outside bar has been removed since I was last there. I'm guessing that's to accomodate live bands. Mark Mulligan ("Mexico Mark") was playing wthe last time I went. He's awesome! I asked the bartender for the "best margarita you have ever made" and got a $7 margarita that couldn't have had any tequila in it because I felt absolutely nothing. Hence- the clothes stayed on that night and Mark did all the entertaining.
