My husband and I were looking for some solid Mexican food and margaritas and found La Mestiza rated highly on Yelp and TripAdvisor. We pulled up to a strip mall and gave each other the "uh, do we try it?" look of worry. We manned up and went in, and we are so happy we did! We immediately got a seat in the small restaurant, and the waitress was taking our order with a smile within the first 2 minutes. She made recommendations based on our tastes and she did not steer us wrong. My husband enjoyed a margarita and fish tacos, and we split the guacamole, which was very fresh and delicious. I had the enchiladas in the pumpkin seed/almond mole and it was just like my mother-in-law's homemade enchiladas! I loved it! Our waitress forgot to bring the guacamole, and did not charge us because of the mistake. That was very nice! I am only giving this place 4 stars because the Horchata was a little bland and the Flan was average, but the rest of the meal was so good and the waitress so nice that we will go back again!
