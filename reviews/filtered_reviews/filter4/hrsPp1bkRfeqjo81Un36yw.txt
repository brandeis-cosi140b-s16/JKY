Friday night armed with our umbrella and Groupon coupon we finally decided to give Padres a try....drive by it all the time but have never stopped in. We had called ahead for a reservation as our coupon suggested but when we got there nobody was in the dining area...yet so we asked if we could sit at the bar instead. We were served by a great bartender with a good smile. She promptly gave us menus and cocktails. We started with the queso dip. It was more like a spinach dip which I liked but my husband is more of a velveeta guy so not quite "cheesy" enough for him. By this time the little place was packed (only 5:45). It appears that they have quite the HH crowd and several HH specials but we were going off the menu. My husband had the tacos and I had the small steak, taco and enchilada plate with beans and rice. It was all very good and neither of us had any complaints. Even though the place was full our bartender was spot on and we never lacked for a drink and she happily boxed up the left overs. (I might add that the left over queso dip was fabulous stuffed inside chicken breasts). We will be back if for no other reason than to work our way throught the extensive taco list which staring... at everybody elses plate made want to snag one when they weren't looking. We will be back and maybe late enough to catch the live music.
