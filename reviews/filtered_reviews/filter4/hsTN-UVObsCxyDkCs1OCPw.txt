i didn't really expect much from this place since it seems like a chain or something. surprisingly, my cabeza burrito tasted really authentic and delicious! what i love about their burrito is that they only put meat and beans (guac, salsa & sour cream if you want everything) - no rice! so it's like a protein explosion in your mouth! haha
