I gotta say, I was honestly going to rate this place at three stars until I read Abe S's review and was reminded that Los Taquitos is definitely solid.  He's dead on - although there are better tacos in Phoenix (ie - the McDowell Taco Corridor!), Los Taquitos does a great job and has food that's just...well...good!  I always go with a carne asada taco and a tostada.  The tostada was awesome.  It was literally like six inches tall with lettuce, delicious meat, beans, and cheesy goodness.  

The taco was good too, but as I mentioned, there are a few places out there that are tough to beat.

The shop is definitely nice, and it's in a really nice area too which is a rare plus for me.  Everyone was super friendly, and I would definitely go back should I be in the area.
