First off, I should mention that I am from Tucson, which I consider the Mexican food capital of the United States.  On a recent trip to Phoenix for a Diamondback's game, we decided to try the very well reviewed Carolina's for a bite to eat.  I am very glad we did.  Carolina's isn't a nice, sit down restaurant where you are going to take out of town visitors for dinner.  It's got tables, chairs, and a walk up counter for ordering your food.  Oh, and a huge menu, with some of the items available in bulk (pounds of chorizo, dozens of tortillas), and it seems to have all these items available all day.  I tried a combination plate with enchilada, taco, beans and rice.  The taco was great, with a homemade shell and very good shredded meat (which seems to have been formed into a patty) inside.  The beans had a good flavor, and the rice was fluffy.  While the enchilada tasted fine, I prefer my sauce to be a bit more orange (this was blood red), and less bitter.  My husband had a footlong chorizo and bean burro, which he said was very good.  Now, about these supposed "best tortillas in Arizona".  That title is still held (in my opinion), by St. Mary's Mexican food in Tucson, but these were very good.  Huge, and a little thicker than St. Mary's, they were good enough for us to buy a dozen to take home.  Overall, the prices at Carolina's were great, the food was very good, and we will be stopping back on our next trip up to Phoenix.
