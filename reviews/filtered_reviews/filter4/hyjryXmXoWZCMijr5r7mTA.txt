Excellent place for Mexican food.  Very loud most of the time mainly from music and the roller coaster running overhead and it's close location to the casino floor, but no problem for us.  We first tried this place over 15 years ago and have been coming here every time we visit Vegas.  Food and service have been consistently excellent over the years.  Complimentary chips and salsa are no longer provided.  You are now charged for them.  I tried their new carne asada street tacos and they tasted great. You can substitute refried beans for black beans.  Wife ordered a two beef enchilada combo which she said was great as always and served hot, very hot. She had a Mojito which was awesome!  We loved it, kids loved it, everyone happy.
