Had breakfast at Dicks Hideaway this morning before a big day of shopping (a group of friends is furnishing a room at a transitional housing program for women0--It was a great place to start the day--I hadn't been there in awhile and had forgotton how good the food is.  As usual the place was crowded (at 10 in the morning) so we sat at the bar (my favorite place)  I ordered carne adovada with scrambled eggs.  The adovado was rich and hot but no so hot to overwhelm the taste buds,  the eggs are nice complement to allow your taste buds to cool off before the next bite of the tender carne adovada.  if you can't get to new mexico any time Dick's Hideaway is a great place to get the red or green chili fix.
