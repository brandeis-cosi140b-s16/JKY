This place is awesome. The wife and I went here last night and the food and drinks were amazing. I had my usual Mexican food beer, miller lite, but she ordered the coconut margarita. That thing was awesome. All I can say is WOW! We also had the fajitas for two. We did shrimp and steak. The food came out piping hot and was delicious all the way to the last bite. They also had mariachi guys playing some good tunes and the atmosphere there was as good as south of the border. Overall a great experience.
