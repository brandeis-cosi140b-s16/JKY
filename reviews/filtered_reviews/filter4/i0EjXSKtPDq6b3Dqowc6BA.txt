It can be difficult to find a good mojito in this town.  Correction: it can be difficult to even find a mojito in this town.  Look no further than Las Velas.  They make them fresh and delicious!  I can't get past how yummy they are, but the sangria is also rather refreshing.

I've been to Las Velas several times and will continue to return.  I've experienced several menu items including the hanger steak tacos, mango chipotle chicken and a pork burrito.  The mango chicken was just okay.  I'm a fan of the hanger steak, so the tacos didn't have to try to hard to please me.  But they did anyway.  I most recently enjoyed the Xel-Ha Burrito with pork and this proved to be my best decision yet.

I've had a seat at the bar but I prefer a table.  Grab a seat by the window and enjoy the entertainment of Market Square over some chips and salsa.  

The cost may seem a little high, but it's worth it.  The portions are generous and I can often find a deal online (Groupon, Google Offers, WPXI Half Off).  I've never had a problem getting a table for dinner.  And to top it off, the service is always muy bueno!
