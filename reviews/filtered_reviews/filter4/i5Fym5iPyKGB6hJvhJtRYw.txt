Went for just a snack and a mexican food kick and was really surprised.  Came in and the 3 mariachis were playing Pink Floyd "Another Brick in the Wall".  So it was fun from the get go.  We had the carne asada sopes.  They were so good.  The masa was freshly fried and it was a hot tiny pillow of goodness.  I could pop these all day.  $8 for four tiny things.  They are about the size of cup cake liner.   I don't know about the rest of the food other than the chips and salsa. They get a 3.  But I would definitely go back for these.
