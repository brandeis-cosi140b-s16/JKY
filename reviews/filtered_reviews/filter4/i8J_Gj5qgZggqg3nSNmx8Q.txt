The food is quite good!  The flavors of the taco/burrito fillings is wonderful.  I like that they have both lettuce AND cabbage at the salsa bar so you can fill your taco how you like.  The tortillas are some of the best I've tasted.  The salsa is hit and miss.  There's a nice selection, but sometimes they can be either bland or way too hot.  The guacamole is AWESOME.  

I've read some of the other reviews that say this place "isn't real Mexican".... uh, it's a heck of a lot closer to Mexican than most of the places in town.  Not sure what these other folks consider "real" Mexican.

My only complaint is that I have to pay for chips and salsa.
