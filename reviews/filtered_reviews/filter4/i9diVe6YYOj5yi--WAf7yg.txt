My party was looking for a place to grab a bite to eat this past weekend and decided to try Hussong's out. As I've mentioned in the past I am very picky as was my group on Mexican food. Hell we all have been eating and cooking it our entire lives. I've been going to the Cantina in Ensenada for 30 years but only to drink. 

Once there ordered drinks that were normal Strip priced and started to check out the menu. 2 of us ordered Huevos Rancheros and other 2 Chiliquiles. The price of $10 was a bargain for casino food. I wasn't expecting what I was about to receive. Both plates were outfreakingstanding! Great meal, spicy, and the drinks that my friends ordered did the job. I highly recommend this joint to anyone that stays at Mandalay or the adjoins casinos. Kudos...
