At 175+ bottles they have the best Tequila & Mezcal selection in the state!   Better yet, every Wednesday is "Tequila Tasting" night where you can get samples of each of them for just a few bucks.  If you aren't familiar with high end tequila's, note that I'm not talking about plastic bottle rot gut, but premium, well aged, connoisseur sipping tequila with a wide range of depth, flavor and character.  They had several smoky mezcals that reminded me of good scotchs and the staff enthusiastically helped guide me towards libations that best suited my personal tastes.

Their entire staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable about their selection.  Verde also offers dozens of freshly prepared original mixed drinks and an incredibly savory food selection.  The interior has a fun south western design style with interesting hand made tile mosaics covering most surfaces an a very stylishly lit bar with wood carvings over the bar in the shape of an agave.  I'll be on the lookout for something to celebrate on coming Wednesdays so I have an excuse to come here for dinner and Tequila Tastings!
