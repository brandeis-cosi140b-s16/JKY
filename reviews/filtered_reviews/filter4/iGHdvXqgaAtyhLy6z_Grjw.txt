New location on Peoria, just off the 101.  It's on the north side of the road, just east of 91st Ave. (old Fazolis location).

Same great fast Mexican food, good prices, and they were busy on the opening day today (May 5th, of course!).  Hours seem restrictive, 7:00 am-8:30pm but oh well, it's great Mexican fare at unbeatable prices.

Butter tortilla, anyone?
