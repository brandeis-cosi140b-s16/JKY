I went here on the 2nd day of business so I still think they are working out a few kinks.  I love the different options they have which make it stand out more than Chipotle.  I had the chile beef burrito enchilada style.  It was really good, it was so big I couldn't finish it.  The bf had a steak quesadilla which he loved and my friend had nachos which looked good.

There is stuff on the menu that I will return to try.  It looked like they hired about 100 people and had them all working!  It was kind of confusing at times but I am sure with time it will all get ironed out!  Good Job bringing something different to the area!
