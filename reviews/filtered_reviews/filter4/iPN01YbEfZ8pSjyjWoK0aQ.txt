Found a new place for street tacos!   I drive past this place quite a bit and I always wanted to stop in... Well I did and it was great!  

Street Taco Special was $3.99  (03-01-10) 

Two tacos with two flour tortillas each, lots of meat and topped with cilantro and onions.  Plus the rice and beans.  Great deal and a perfect dinner!  Reminds me of Rocky Point!

Beers are pricey.. $4 but the cheap food made up for that!
