I went for the first time tonight, honestly the absolute best thing about the place was the Art.  The work by a Donna Bonavito and Jessie Butterfield was impressive and amazing.  I went for happy hour and really enjoyed the Veggie taco, it was very heaping with flavor and ingredients.  The chips and salsa were very good.  It is a popular spot with a good vibe.
