Go on Tuesdays!  They have $1 tacos... just be sure to have them clarify which ones; not all of them are a $1.  I have been here twice so far and the service the first time was attentive... the second time my waitress seemed a little spacey but got the job done:).  Today I decided to try their house made guacamole which was very tasty and their chips and salsas are not to be missed.  So far I have only tried their shredded beef taco and the chorizo and potato taco... they both were really good.  I have not had a chance to try a margarita yet because I have only been during work... but a see a happy hour in my future and Cien Agave:).
