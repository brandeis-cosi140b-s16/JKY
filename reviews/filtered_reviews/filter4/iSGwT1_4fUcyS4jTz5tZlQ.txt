After hearing about this place in the paper and from the chef/owner of Barrio Cafe as a savory, cheap eat, I finally gave it a try earlier this year and have been wanting to go back! I had half a regular torta with the tender slices of  beef (mmm...little slices of heaven), avocado,  that pork, all on a white roll. And there's no way I could finish a whole torta. So, from a budget standpoint, it's even more worth the money. Also tried one of their huge huarache, corn tortilla that was snowed on by queso fresco. Anyone who goes must have one of their fresh fruit juices. They have a wonderful variety and it's a nice kick with meaty, not-sweet menu. It's definitely one of those places where there are more natives than gringos, which is a good sign.
