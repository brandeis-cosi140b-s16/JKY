Food was fresh, service was attentive, ambiance was family oriented and nice. This place deserves being ranked one of the top eateries in Wickenburg, but unfortunately it's  relative to a low bar.

My wife and kids ordered tostadas. I ordered the pork chops. They didn't have the pork chop (we came here for lunch), so I ordered the carne asada instead. My wife and kids reported that the tostadas were a bit bland. My steak was seasoned with the steak seasoning you buy at the supermarket.

All in all, we were glad to stop by and we would come again. Be sure to have your bar calibrated to small town restaurants before you get too excited about the 4.5 rating.
