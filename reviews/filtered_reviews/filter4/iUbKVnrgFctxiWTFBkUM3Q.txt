Pleasantly pleased with the food, service, and drinks at this hole-in-the-wall-joint located in Ballys, at the very back of the casino floor. 

Me and my boyfriend came here to meet up with my uncle who was staying at Ballys. The place is pretty small with a few tables and stools and a couple of stools at the bar  The both of us sat at the bar and ordered entrees before my uncle arrived:

1) I ordered the HALF RACK BABY BACK RIBS w/ a choice of 2 sides; I got the baked beans and cole slaw. I don't remember what kind of rub or sauce but whatever our server suggested was really good. The meat was cooked well as were the baked beans. As for the cole slaw, it was swimming in a pool of the dressing, yuck. 
2) The boyfriend ordered the CARNE ASADA including spanish rice, refried beans, and choice between corn or flour tortillas. The carne asada was a nice sized portion and the accompanying onions and peppers added more flavor. The beans were good, but the spanish rice was a bit salty. 

We had just finished dinner when my uncle came to meet us.  From then on it was a nonstop drink-a-thon. Beers are relatively cheap, with $5 or $7 pitchers, depending on the beer, and so between the free flowing cheap beer and the endless choices of tequila, we stayed at the bar for a good majority of the night. The 2 bartenders were extremely friendly and attentive getting refills and explaining the 2 sets of flights my uncle had also just ordered:

1) The SPIRIT OF MEXICO: 4 shots of various tequilas for $29 
2) BLANCO FLIGHT: 4 different shots of other tequilas for $29

Overall a really surprisingly good time at such a random place. The food was good, the service was attentive and friendly, and the drinks were relatively cheap for being in Vegas.
