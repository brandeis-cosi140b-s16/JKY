This place will not let you down, food wise. The dishes are excellent and the tequila menu is outstanding. After a good pirate show, I like to dine at Isla's. TI as they call it now (formerly the family friendly, no reason to go inside because the pirate show is on the front lawn Treasure Island) is trying to change its image and along with Tangerine this place is the only other thing holding up the crutch. The ambiance is a little toned down for a Vegas place but that's refreshing on Night Two especially. The service though is less than stellar. Our server knew little about the menu and even less about serving. One fun thing though is they have a Tequilier (a Sommelier, but with an expertise in Tequila) She was superb and very well-educated. Even my friends who swore off tequila in college (due to the frequency of its partnership in less than desirable indiscretions) found ones that they liked and even paired well with the food we were having. I've known about this trend in Mexican "Bistros" for a while but had yet to participate. Having survived my second round of pledging involving tequila I can now say that I have a new found love this time. I hated the stuff with all good reason the first time (the plastic bottle was guilty by association)!
