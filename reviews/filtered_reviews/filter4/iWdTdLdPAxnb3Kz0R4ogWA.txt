Great Happy Hour specials, tasty appetizers and fab Margaritas! 

The Pink Taco's regular menu is a little pricey for Mexican grub but try the happy hour The house Margaritas are 2-4-1 and absoulutly fabulous! The happy hour appetizer menu is ample and filling enough for dinner. We had the sampler plate are were not disappointed. The ambiance was great. We were sitting at the bar and the staff was very friendly, chatty and attentive. If you stick to the specials or split an entree (they are big enough for two to share) the Pink Taco can be a good dining value.
