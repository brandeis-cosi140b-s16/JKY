This is a typical Tex-Mex eatery. 

The tropical guava mojitos are divine here!! The menu is fairly diverse. Mostly mexican dishes but there are salads and pastas with a spicy kick to them.

The table side guacamole is delicious but not worth the $10. (especially since it's considered an appetizer)

Entrees average around $12-16. 

A very spacious location, so great for groups. I've heard their happy hour is great. Will try that next time. Parking is limited but there is a valet outside.
