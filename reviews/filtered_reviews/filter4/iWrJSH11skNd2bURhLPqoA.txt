Very yummy! I'd recommend the tacos they were sooo good, Especially the Al Pastor! Also recommend the bbq beef.

Entrees were not as impressive. 
Nachos aren't as loaded and flavorful as you would want for $9. The steak had spot on flavor but it was a bit chewy.

It's nice to get off the strip in Vegas and find normal spots to eat and hang out.  

This place has great drinks and decor even though its located in a strip mall it doesn't feel like you are just in a strip mall. 
Great spot to hang out and stuff some margaritas & tacos in your system.
