We went to Pink Taco LV on Sunday afternoon.  We never made it to the Scottsdale location when we lived in AZ because there was no shortage of great Mexican food in the area - and well, with the kitchy name, we had very low expectations of the taste.

Stanley K was right on about the chips.  As hungry/hungover as you might be (and as freaken long as it is taking for your food to show up), resist the urge to eat the whole basket of chips.  For the meal, we had the carne asada, and cheese enchiladas.  I was impressed with the enchiladas (ordered with cheese only, no chicken) - but I couldn't finish them because I was stuffed from the chips and the mediocre salsa. :(   The margaritas were tasty, decently alcoholic, and not overly sour.

The decor was quirky, but comfortable, and the music was great.    We sat inside, but if you sit on the patio, you can observe the Sunday "Rehab" party debauchery in misted comfort.
