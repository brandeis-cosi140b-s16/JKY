I am really torn about this place. It has all the markings of a top notch food joint. Hole-in-the-wall characteristics that gives it a certain "feel" of authenticity. I've been to Mexico several times and the best tacos ive ever had were from street vendors, not the restaurant adjacent to the (insert touristy hotel here). 
So i had high hopes, and everyone told me if i wanted legit mexican food in Phoenix, this is where you roll to. 
The pricing is unbeatable, especially for the portion sizes. 
So i get the salsa/hot sauce, and its great. I went here right before close so ill give them a pass, but the tortilla chips were no bueno. They just tasted like bulk chips you would get from taco bell or something like that. Or like some bulk generic chip bag from Sams Club. Enough with crappy analogies, they just weren't that good.
So on to the tacos... The crispy tacos were ON POINT! Amazing, great flavor, crispy shell, exactly what i had hoped for. Some of the best crispy tacos id ever had (in mexico i had only seen and eaten soft tacos).
The soft tacos were good but way to soggy. Like you would take a bite and the soft shell would disintegrate in your hand. So why if the chips sucked and the soft tacos were sub par do i give it 4 stars?
The chips, its like who cares. If i go to red lobster and the rolls arent warmed all the way, im not bashing the whole meal. 
And for the soft tacos, im not sure what was up with those. But from some of the other dishes i tried with the party i was with everything else seemed fantastic. So.... you need to go here.... just lower your expectations on soggy soft tacos.
