Taco Monday!  Can't understand why you would ever eat anywhere else on a Monday.  

Great tacos, very reasonable price.  Also had the "must have", very popular brussel sprout nachos ( a huge, very filling portion).  The cocktails were tasty too (though they were not a bargain).  

All in all I would certainly go back any day; and certainly on a Monday!!
