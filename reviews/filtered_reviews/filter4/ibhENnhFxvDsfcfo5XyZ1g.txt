When you think of Mariscos you think of the beach. Not Vegas, or the desert.

But here we are.

First things first. You WILL fill up on those damn chips and salsa. I normally hate chips and salsa. It always seems like they take 2-day old stale chips with whatever garbage left-over salsa from the night before and slide it in front of you.

But as I write this, my mouth waters for the spicy-ness of the salsa they serve here. I almost ruined my meal by filling up on chips and salsa.....

So spicey in fact that I had to get up and grab a handful of hot fritos to quench that spicey craving.

Moving on.

We had a party of 6 with 5 seperate checks and our waitress did an amazing job of keeping track of us all. She never missed a beat.

The food was delicious. I had the camarones a la diabla and they tasted really damn good.

The reason I knocked off a star for this establishment was because the waitress asked how spicey I wanted it. Now.... the fact that my mouth was on the verge of fire cause of the salsa, I wanted more spicey.

She asked me on a level of 1 to 10, how spicey I wanted my food and I said 10. She asked me 'Are you sure?'

This question took me back to a time when someone asked me that while placing a hot wings order and I said yes. 

I ended up getting the ring of fire.

I felt like the salsa was level 2 so I asked for level 5 fearing I would die if I got level 10.

Fast forward to eating my delicious meal and there was no spicey whatsoever.

I felt robbed. I wanted to sit there uncomfortably fanning my mouth asking for water.

I'm glad this place is sort of a hidden gem. Keeps all the asshole out-of-towners (no worries, I feel that way about you all anyways) away and hungover on the strip.
