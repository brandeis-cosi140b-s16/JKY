Revo is pretty good.  It's no America's Taco Shop, but it is a solid place to grab a bite and enjoy some time with some friends.  America's is obviously the standard by which all Mexican is held accountable in the Valley of the Sun.

The best part of the entire meal was the rice with corn.  This might be the best side dish in all of Phoenix.

I will be back here.  The only reason that it doesn't get a 5 star rating, is the menu is quite confusing (plus I can't hold it in my hands and read it over).  The best part about America's is that the menu has absolutely no choices.  This is the exact opposite.
