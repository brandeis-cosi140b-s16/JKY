We ate at this restaurant on a Sunday evening.  We had to wait about 30 min for a table. It was worth the wait. The ambiance was cool with high ceilings, fire pits etc. I tried both the fish tacos and the mushroom tacos.  The fish tacos were great.  The blood orange margarita was tangy and tasty. We really enjoyed this place!
