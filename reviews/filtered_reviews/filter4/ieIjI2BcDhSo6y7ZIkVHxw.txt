This place has been consistently delicious. 

For authentic mexican cuisine (not a on the borders fan) this is the best place for food. 

We have had the White sands chimichanga, regular chimichanga, taco plate, the pollos bowl, taco salad, even tried fish tacos once (was not disappointed), green chilli burrito, and all sorts of cocktails and on tap home brewed beers. 

The servers are always polite, place is always clean. Food fresh to order and comes out quick. 

We have been going to Arriba's as our favorite hmm I want to eat out tonight. 

Best by far that the spot is easy to get in, get a bite and get out without too much headache. 

Great place for a family get together and trust us the flavors are exceptional. 

I've never gotten sick from it, never get sick of the flavors they are able to stuff into their plates, all come with sides of either black, refried, pinto beans, spanish house rice and usually some salad and salsa. Request Guacamole freshly home made for an additonal charge ( it is really delicious) the margaritas and fresh chili smells bring out what is best about this location.
