Wanted to try this place since my hubby has a very special diet and this place seemed like the only place we can get a yummy meal. 

I would like to start off by saying this place is super clean! There is enough room for large or small groups. Customer service is great and there are so many delicious options. 

We decided to try their chicken quesadilla and chicken platter. Couldnt believe how fast we got our order. 
Chicken was juicy and flavorful. The quesadilla was delicious!!
