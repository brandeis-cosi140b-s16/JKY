We visited Canonita back in April during an anniversary trip when we stayed at the Venetian.  We tried 6 of the Venetian restaurants on this trip, and this was one of two that we really enjoyed.

Our waiter was Jesus, and he was excellent!  He happily recommended menu items for us that turned out to be really great.  He was very attentive throughout the entire meal.  We had a seat right next to the canal, so if you enjoy the singing of the gondoliers, it's a nice environment.  They also have seats more inside toward the bar if you don't want to be near the canal.

Appetizer:  Queso Fundido - this was amazing!  We ordered it with chorizo, but I would probably order it with jalapeno as well next time to make it spicy.  It was served with fresh tortillas and we ended up requesting additonal tortillas for it.

Meals:
- Wild Mushroom Enchiladas with poblano chili sauce, cilantro rice, borracho beans (pintos and corn).
- Carne Asada Nortena with black beans, roasted cerranos and garlic, and sweet corn tamales.
- Requested a side of fresh tortillas for this dish also since it was sliced up in a manner similar to a flank steak.  Both meals were presented very nicely and the food was great.

Dessert:
- Tres Leches - very good!

We'll be back the next time we come to Vegas if for nothing else than to order the Queso Fundido again.  The only knock on it was that we had to keep requesting more tortillas because they were really small and we were charged each time we requested them.
