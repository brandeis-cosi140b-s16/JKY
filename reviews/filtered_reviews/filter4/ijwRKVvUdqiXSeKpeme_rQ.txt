Awesome in one word! I wanted a taco salad and that's what I got! I asked for steak and really couldn't get anything else due to food restrictions so asked for a lil extra steak and he gave me some. The line was insanely long but it was so quick! I think I was there for only about 5 minutes before I got to the front. When I got to the front it wasn't like they were over worked all had a great face on and were all about helping out! Great job!
