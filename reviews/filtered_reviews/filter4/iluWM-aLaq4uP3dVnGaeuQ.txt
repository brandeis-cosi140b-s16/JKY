I absolutely love Gallo Blanco! Great spot to take friends in from out of town to show off what Phoenix has to offer. Nestled in the Clarendon Hotel (one of the oldest hotels in Phoenix) sits this little gem of a cantina. 

Fantastic Margs and cocktails and definite must go for happy hour. If you like street tacos they are supa cheep during happy hour but full of flavor. The pork, carne asada, shrimp, hell even the veggie is delish!

I can't do a review without also mentioning, that Wednesday night is Flamenco night, and the dancers are a blast to watch and very beautiful. 

Ps. May fav guac in the valley as well!
