Was a little confused that it was literally right next to sapphires. I thought it was inside and almost didn't go lmao. Anyways my husband and I went here for a bite. He had the mole enchiladas and I had an appetizer. Both were good. The salsa tasted and smelled like it was going bad though :/ that was the only let down. 
The tres leches with rum and flan were amazing. We will be back :)
