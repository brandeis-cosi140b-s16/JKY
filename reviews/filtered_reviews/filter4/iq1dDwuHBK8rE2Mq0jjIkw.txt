Could I give 5 stars? Maybe, but as I refine my yelping, I've become more selective on doling them out, which is not fair because earlier in my yelp experience I gave them out like a drunk sailor on shore leave.  So factor that in. 

I will say we had an awesome experience at Joyride and I will go back.  The service was excellent from the front desk on.  A sweet hostess, super cool waitress and a gentleman who I believe was the manager all attended to our group with the type of genuine sweetness I find lacking in most of these concept driven Hipster employed venues.  This paved the way for an excellent night as it put us in the mood to enjoy the food and atmosphere.  

We loved the space, and really loved the music which made it hard not to tap toes too (and with speakers in restroom's we joked that we might have had an after party dance club in there). 

The food was serviceable, braised tacos were out favorite and nothing was bad per se, but really it was the overall experience we enjoyed and the food hit the spot.  

My only negative was that I rarely eat sweets, so we got churro's and i'm spoiled being from LA where I can get them so soft and fluffy and flaky and delicious, these seemed like carboard by contrast.
