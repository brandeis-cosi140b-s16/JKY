Chuy's is a weekly favorite of mine and an easy recommendation. My first trip to Chuys was a complete disaster and left me really hating the restaurant but a unique circumstance brought us back for a second visit and I've been happy ever since. 

The chips are light and crunchy, the salsa is sweet with a touch of spicy, and the jalapeno ranch is so good I would take a bath in it. The famous "Big as yo' face" burritos and the Elvis fried chicken are my top two recommendations. Make sure you go early if you plan on getting any of the daily dinner specials... they run out early and often.
