Really great salsa bar, tacos, quesadillas and burros.  Service is hit or miss depending on how busy they are but are very friendly.  Just get the food ala carte, the beans and rice portions with a combo are small and aren't that great.  Not a very good selection of beers and the regular margarita is just so so.
