I liked this place so much, I ate here twice during my stay. 

Meal #1: pink taco plate. This was really good. I wish I could remember what was in it, though. Honestly, someone just said I should order it, so I did. It comes with 3 tacos, which are a bit like glorified street tacos. I want to say they were chicken. A special sauce may or may not have been involved, but if it was I didn't notice and I normally dislike copious amounts of any sauce. I like that they give you 3 good-sized tacos. Those, with your typical rice & beans, managed to fill me up. 

Meal #2: 1/2 chicken in a mole sauce. One thing I love about getting a 1/2 chicken is that I'm guaranteed (usually) a nice, full, plump breast. Which I got here. Slathered in their viscous mole sauce, it was absolutely fantastic,. The thing I don't like is that the rest of the meat you have to pick off isn't as good, and you now have to contend with things like fat and little bones. I actually do all of that scavenging first, delaying the gratification of eating the coveted breast. I do weird stuff when I eat, what can I say? 

It came on a bed of  - you guessed it - rice & beans. Still as good as they were the other night. 

The staff is very dependent on how good they can predict your tip will be. Meaning, when they learn my gf and I won't be having appetizers or over-priced drinks, they tend to pay a little less attention. I understand they work on tips, but it shouldn't be my fault I don't want more than I ordered. It's obvious to me as a customer, and pretty annoying. But the food rocks, so I'll be sure to come back.
