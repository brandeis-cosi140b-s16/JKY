Yes this place is a little pricey but these are typical prices to main strip restaurants and the food is well worth it. Definitely try the salt air Margritas with the lovely salty foam, we were more focused on the Asian side of the menu, other than the guacamole which was very good and came with great warm tortillas. Tried the 20 vegetable rice, the dancing eggplant (awesome with the twirling bonito flakes-you have to see it!) and the 'when pigs fly' steamed bbq pork bun. All dishes were very good and the buns were amazing. Definitely one of my favorite places in Vegas.
