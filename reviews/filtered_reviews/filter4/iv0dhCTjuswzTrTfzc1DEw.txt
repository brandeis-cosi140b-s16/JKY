Recently made my second visit to this restaurant with a friend.  Beautiful, large patio, excellent service, and great food.  Certainly not your typical Mexican restaurant - I would review the menu online before deciding on eating here.  Our meals have always been very good.  It is a nice place to go for an evening of visiting with friends without feeling rushed by a staff looking to turn the table.  It is also one of the better options for a larger party in terms of seating.
