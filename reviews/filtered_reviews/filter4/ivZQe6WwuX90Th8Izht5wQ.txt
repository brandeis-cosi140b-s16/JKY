Today I met a friend at Padre's for lunch. First off, I have to give a shout out to those working the patio today. Wow - exceptional customer service. Several people came by our table including the owner to refill drinks and check on us. They were smiley and personable. We started with salsa and chips. Growing up in NM, all restaurants serve chips and salsa at no cost. It is always hard for me to break open the wallet for this however today I arrived early and I was really hungry. The mild and medium salsas were bland however the spicy salsa hit the spot. Some ladies to the side of us ordered the queso with chorizo. I was quite jealous as I heard them oohing and ahhing over the appetizer. I ordered the fish tacos and my friend had the chicken tacos. Both were yummy and reasonably priced. Off their special lunch menu, beans and rice are extra. Again, I am not used to having to pay extra for these. On the plus side they were very good. It's been a few years since I went visited this place and I'm pretty sure I'll be going back sooner than later. Especially to sit on the nice patio outside during the cool Phoenix months.
