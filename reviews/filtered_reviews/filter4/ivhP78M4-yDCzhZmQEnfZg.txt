When I first heard of KoMex Fusion, I knew I had to go try it. Before moving to Las Vegas I lived in Michigan, where we didn't have many Korean restaurants to begin with, nonetheless any that were infused with different cuisines. 

I'm Korean and Korean food is my absolute favorite. I couldn't fathom how Mexican food could be mixed into Korean food... The creativity that exists on the West coast!

I went with my roommate at the time and we got Bulgogi Kimchi fried rice, Bulgogi fried rice, and split the Bulgogi nacho fries. The nacho fries was the infused dish and it was surprisingly delicious! There were a lot of different flavors but it actually worked. Bulgogi, cheese, pico de gallo, Korean gochujang sauce. Sounds like a lot going on but I would definitely order these again!

The Bulgogi Kimchi fried rice wasn't anything special but not bad tasting. I think I could whip up better... :)

Overall I would give it a 4/5; awesome KoMex fries, and average Korean fried rice.
