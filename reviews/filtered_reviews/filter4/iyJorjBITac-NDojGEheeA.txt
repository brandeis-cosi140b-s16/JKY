This place is completely out of my way and completely worth the trip. The spicy bean dip and fried tortillas are like HOLY SH*% and the Carnitas Chimichanga was so good if they had just brought me a plate of Carnitas and nothing else it would have been worth the trip. Great portions, great prices, location is a little eh' but the food is bangin! Great Sangria Margarita too.
