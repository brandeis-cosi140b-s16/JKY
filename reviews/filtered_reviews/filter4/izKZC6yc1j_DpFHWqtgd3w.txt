I had the machada enchiladas and it was excellent and a decent price I believe like 10 for two enchiladas with beans and rice (no fideo for me). My wife had the beef tamales which were good but too spicy for her liking. What I loved the most was the service. I'm speaking for me and my wife as part of this review but we also had my three kids my father in law and his wife,my brother in law and wife and two kids so we had a huge party and no one was disappointed. They brought our food out all at one time in a timely manner and we're all very kind. Our server was Cameron and he didn't miss a beat. The treasure chest they have for the kids was a added bonus and even though it wasn't immaculate toys in it, it was a kind gesture and the kids loved it. Great job Aunt chiladas.
