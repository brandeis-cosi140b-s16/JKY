I live down the street and have been here several times now. The tortilla shells are warm and fresh and the salsa is really fantastic! 

Here's the problem: there's WAY to much 'sauce' confined within the meat. By sauce I'm referring what the meat is cooked in. A couple times it seemed like I was eating a taco that had just sauce in it!
