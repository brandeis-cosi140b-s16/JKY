First of all to those calling this neighborhood a ghetto its not ,it is a barrio phoenix original barrio,and it is home to the oldest Mexican street gang which leads to the start of my review,yes Carolinas is a hole in the wall restaurant which i choose to order and dash i wont eat there,for some reason the locals will not mess with you or your car so you are safe  being there.the place is a bit on the dirty side, but damn it they have the best tortillas and green Chile burritos,their chorrizo is all right but not worth the price.Once upon a time their burritos where huge and full of meat but it seems since Carolina (respectfully)passed away her children have become stingy with the meat.Every chance i get when coming home from the east valley i stop there,but i usually go to the Peoria location.
