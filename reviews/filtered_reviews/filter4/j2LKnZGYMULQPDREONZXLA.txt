Tasty good stuff!  Portions large enough two can share an appetizer and leave happy campers.  Margaritas are great and the guacamole is to die for.  Salsa has a strange flavor I was not a fan of but my boyfriend loved it.

Staff is nice and really fun.  If you are looking for some unique Mexican food in Tempe Mucho Gusto is muy bien.
