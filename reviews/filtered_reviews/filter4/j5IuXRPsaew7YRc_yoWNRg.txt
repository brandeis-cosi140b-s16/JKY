To be honest, I was against going to Chino. It just seemed like too many different flavors for me to enjoy it. As soon as we walked in we were greeted warmly by Mark. He then gave us 6 samples of the food to try and then proceeded to explain the menu and how to order. 

The food is really good. I opted for the Emerald Chicken; chicken breast with a ginger onion sauce and carnitas, white rice and re-fried beans. The Jade Red Chicken is kind of like sesame chicken and was delicious, as was the fried rice and Snickerdoodle cookie that you get with your dish. 

Not a fancy place by any means. It's reminiscent of a Chinese take out, but much larger. Its definitely an experience worth trying.
