Finally got around to trying Cafe Rio for the first time. Wow, it's really hard to argue with just north of $6 for a gigantic, filling lunch.

We got here a little before noon. Found out later that we were lucky enough to dodge the peak lunch hour line. Holy crap.

I went with the daily special, which was a chicken tostada salad. It was really nice. I picked the pinto beans and gave them the okay to put "everything" on it, and it certainly seemed like they did. A tortilla at the bottom of the plate, a whole mess of salad, a solid helping of chicken, a bunch of tostada strips, a gob of sour cream, half of a lime, and the amazing cilantro lime "vinaigrette" that was definitely more of a dressing. Everything worked very well together and nothing was bland or overly salty. Oh, and I got a drink with the cost of the special, and I picked the strawberry lemonade with stevia sweetener to save on calories.

I'll definitely come back and try the other specials, and I may look into some of the regular menu items too. This is well worth a visit at non-peak lunch hours.
