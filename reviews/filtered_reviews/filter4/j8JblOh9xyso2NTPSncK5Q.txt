Service was impeccable, we were given attention and courtesy. The employees made it feel like home, were very nice, the atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. We were seated right away, and throughout the entire dinner they never hesitated to ask us if we need anything or wanted something. Which I really really liked because they made my family and I feel the good vibes. The experience they offered was truly one of a kind, the food was delicious and well prepared. Very extravagant view of the Las Vegas strip, it's like you're in Mexico with an enchanting view of the strip. Phenomenal location, Amazing service, Such a treat.
