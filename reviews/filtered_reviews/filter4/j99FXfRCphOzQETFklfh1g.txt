Great place to eat! The environment is very welcoming and comfortable. $2 tacos & $5 margs at happy hour... Can't beat that. They surprisingly really good tacos for $2. Defiantly recommend the carnitas tacos. The guac is nothing special but the tacos make up for it. Oh yeah... The salas, is GREAT! I'll take a side to-go!
