Kitschy Mexican surf atmosphere, friendly service, and delicious food. Prices are a little high for this type of Mexican fare, but they're justified by the high-quality, fresh ingredients used. Rethink what you know about a bean and cheese burrito...theirs is a lard-free blend of beans and cheese in a lightly grilled tortilla. But it's the carne asada that's front and center here. The carne asada quesadilla and their specialty, the vampiro, are both exceptional. Add the unique America's corn and you've got yourself quite a fantastic meal!
