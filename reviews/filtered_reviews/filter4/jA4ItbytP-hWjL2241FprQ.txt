Here's my big tip about Yayo Taco: Order the fish tacos or the shrimp tacos. Oh and order the ceviche! 

I guess I happened to luck out by going all seafood the night I ate here. I'm not sure why, it might have had something to do with the fact that I was with my friend who is a vegetarian and I thought getting the fish may offend her less than say a heaping pile of carne asada. I am glad I did though. These tacos were soooo good. They are the perfect size too, so you can order a couple different ones and get a variety.

The night I went they were hosting a concert with a heavy metal band from Spain. That was really interesting to watch. This place definitely has that "college divey venue" feel. The bathroom is hideous, although not as bad as Double Down.

My only complaint is the tables are sticky gross. So if you can eat at the bar, it's much more clean. Supposedly there is a student discount for UNLV and CSN students - since I am neither of those things, it holds little consequence to me. I did note while there that some people there were complaining about the pricing here has risen. *shrug* Honestly I think it's pretty spot-on for what you're getting.

When I go back here I am getting the fish/shrimp tacos and the ceviche. Seriously, their ceviche was delicious! I am picky about my ceviche too because I've grown up on a recipe my father learned to make when he lived in Panama. So if a place can impress me with that, then I am definitely going back!
