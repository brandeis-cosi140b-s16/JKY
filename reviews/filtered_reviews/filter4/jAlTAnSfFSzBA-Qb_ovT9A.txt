I came in here on a Sunday with a friend.  We hadn't seen each other in months so we were in no hurry.  Which is good because the nice waiter was super busy.  When things did slow down later he joked to us that just as soon as he sent an employee home early because it was slow, everyone and they mama came in for tacos.

I got a fish taco and a veggie taco.  My friend got 2 fish tacos.  The piece of fish I got was significantly smaller than the pieces she got, not sure what's up there.  Food was good, price was right also.  I think the whole bill (each of us got 2 tacos, 1 beer and 1 tea) was around 20 bucks, no complaints.  I liked the style and vibe in the shop. Great salsa bar too.

Lots of yelpers mentioned the cramped style and slow service.  I unfortunately have to agree, but as I said we didn't mind the wait cuz we were chatting.  I would not recommend this spot for big groups or people on lunch breaks, otherwise-enjoy!
