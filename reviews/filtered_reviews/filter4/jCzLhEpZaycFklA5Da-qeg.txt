Nacho Daddy is a good spot if you're downtown and craving some Mexican fare. We came on a busy Sunday night, football and Life is Beautiful festival happening, and we were greeted quickly.  Our server really made the experience 4 star, always checking on us and fast service! Thanks Mark M. :)

The food, I'd give 3.5 stars. It's was fresh, but lacked a little on taste. I got the enchiladas, and the green sauce was barely present. I like my enchiladas pretty saucy.  But they had enough sour cream and sides to keep it from being too dry.  The Daddy's Margarita was pretty tasty though.

There are better places for Mexican food in town. But if you're looking to satisfy your appetite for a good price Downtown, Nacho Daddy didn't disappoint.
