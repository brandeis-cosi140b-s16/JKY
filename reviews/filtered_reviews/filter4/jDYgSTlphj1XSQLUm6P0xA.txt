"Comida chingona" for sure ! If you want higher end mexican, give this place a try! The Guava mimosas were sooo good! I tried a little bit of the cochinita pibil and although im not a fan of pork I did find it rather tasty! I liked my enchiladas but I'd have to say the spinach crepes were my favorite!
