Food was fantastic, nice drink selection, attentive and knowledgeable staff. Would have been a 5 star experience if the music had not been so loud. Could seriously not carry on a conversation with a person sitting 24 imches from me. When told, our waitress was able to get the music turned down enough that we could talk. While iIwill most certainly return for the great food and service I may try a non-weekend evening to see if the sound is better. I recommend the Pork Green Chile Burrito and Enchiladas. Guacamole was top notch as well.
