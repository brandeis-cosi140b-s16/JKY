Decided to stop in today for lunch after reading the great reviews and I am so glad I did! It was fantastic! I had 2 carne asada and one el pastor and a side of beans all this for $8! My food came out several minutes later and was piping hot! At first bite I knew I had found a taco joint that I will be coming back to! The tacos were awesome and the beans were super yummy as well. You got a very big portion of beans (easy to share). I know I will certainly be back soon!!!

Service was great as well!
