When I pulled into the parking lot, I noticed that the Paco's Tacos is in the old Manzetti's building.  Flashbacks of their delicious salads and bread came to mind.
It was a warm evening, and I was able to score outdoor seating for my friend and me.  We were given chips and salsa.  The salsa had nice heat, but there was something thick and sweet about it. 
The menu is meat heavy.  But, I ordered the Too Big Taco Salad without meat.  Wow!  It came with greens, queso, black beans, cheese, corn shaved off of the cob, tossed in a Ranch like dressing.  It also featured tortilla chips nestled under the greens.  Kind of like eating nachos and salad simultaneously.  Very filling.  I may have finished half of it and then our server promptly removed it.  He didn't ask me if I was finished, but probably noting my diminutive size, he figured that I should be.  In retrospect, I wish that I had asked for a box.  However, it may have been one of those dishes that doesn't keep well. 
The background music appeared to be mostly country.  Not to my liking, but it provably suits a Tex-Mex place.
So, I had a bit of a Manzetti's salad flashback.  I think that I will I order that same dish again when I return.
