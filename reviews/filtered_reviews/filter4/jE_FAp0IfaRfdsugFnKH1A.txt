We ordered the queso dip with meat and it was gone within seconds .. My son had the shrimp fajitas and he barely had room to finish them .. I had the street tacos , they were ok, maybe a bit more cilantro / onion mix would've been nice but they were filling .. Our server Jasmine was super, she was very friendly and prompt ., I'm sure we'll be retuning soon..
