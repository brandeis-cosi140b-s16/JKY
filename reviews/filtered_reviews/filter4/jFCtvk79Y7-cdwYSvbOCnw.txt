Great experience at Viva Mercado's in Village Square, mainly due to our waiter.  The little extras really wowed us!  In addition to the beans & salsa dips, he brought us a plate of golden, sautéed onions with jalapeños.  After our meal, we were given a dessert of tortilla-churro-style drizzled with caramel.  He made us feel really special!  Our food was very good and plentiful, with lots of leftovers for today's lunch - yay!  We'll be back!
