We used a Groupon to try this place. We ordered the street Tacos so we could get to try all the different Taocs. They brought out the taco on a long wooden board which was a cool idea. I really liked every single one of them. It would be hard to pick one that stood out more than the other. Lots of great specials everyday. Happy Hour is a good deal. Just keep in mind that if you order a Margarita during Happy Hour you don't get the HH pricing if you're using a Groupon. :( I would definitely go back again.
