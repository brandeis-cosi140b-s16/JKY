Why oh why did i wait so long?! Listen, this place is a hell of a value. Even at $2 a pop, ordering 5 tacos and adding the free grilled green onions and jalape√±os will only run you $10. Plenty of food for me!

The al pastor was delicious. The servers were nice. The service itself was attentive. The only knock on this place was the carne asada tacos. Mine were a bit grissly and fatty. 

I'll give it 4 stars, as I'll be back pretty soon, but I wouldn't give it 5 based on the carne asada...
