So we have passed by this place many times.  I've been into the Ace Hardware right next to it several times.  Don't know how we have never seen this place.  Fortunately we searched yelp for something new and gave it a shot.  The street tacos are awesome.  Looks like I'll have to go back for a carne asada burrito, but based on the size I saw (and what I've read), it's gonna have to be a one item meal!  They're huge!  I tried the street tacos to sample a few things...carnitas, pollo and pescado.  All excellent.  I would have to lean to the carnitas though.  Definately going back!

Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is there was a kid sweeping and mopping the floor and we were having to get out of his was several times.  Just kinda rubbed me wrong. And while I loved the music, it was a bit loud and I don't know how much it was there for the ambience, the customers, or the staff.   Everything else about the staff was great.  Friendly and positive.  Mabe my next trip will kick it up to 5.....
