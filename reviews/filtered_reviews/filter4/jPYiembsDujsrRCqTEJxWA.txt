Wow, this was surprisingly good! 

We made reservations to meet someone there and then realized it was a mexican hooters.  we were sadly disappointed that it was not the case, but i have to give them props for their grub.

The chips were fresh and the Salsa's were excellent.  I had the chicken burrito, it was one of the best I've had.  It was reasonably priced for a Casino.
