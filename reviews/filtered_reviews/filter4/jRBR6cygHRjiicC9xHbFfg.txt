Yum! I really enjoyed this place. We went here for dinner on a Saturday night at 7:30 and were seated within a few minutes after arriving.

We ordered the chicken tortilla soup and queso fundido which was more than enough food for two girls. Both were very tasty. I also got a margarita which was also fantastic and very strong. The salsa that came with the chips was very good, and not very spicy. Compared to other overpriced bland restaurants on the strip, this wasn't too expensive and actually worth the trip.
