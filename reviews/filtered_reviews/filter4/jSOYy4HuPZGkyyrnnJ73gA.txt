Love this place. Watched basketball there last night with a group of people. Fun and relaxed atmosphere with just the right amount of "divy-ness". We mostly drank but had a few apps. The chips and queso were great as well as the wings and shredded beef mini chimis. The waitresses/bartenders were super attentive. I couldn't believe how they were so on top of it with cleaning up plates and empty drinks and bringing us new ones. Probably one of my favorite places to go when I'm in town visiting. Will be back.
