A Pittsburgh must visit, hard to get in but worth the wait...So if you are thinking of checking out this spot make a reservation.
Once you walk in you can see the kitchen staff working to make the great food. They also have a few sits attached to the building serving as a sort of chefs table section looking into the kitchen.
The first thing we noticed was the music in the establishment was much to LOUD,Awful Loud. The reason why I gave a four star rating....
We sat a the bar and Molly quickly took charge of us, she recommend drinks and suggested some food items.I went with Molly's recommended drink "Dusk till Dawn" it was carefully crafted and delish. We then order Chips and salsa (3- hot, medium, mild) as well as guacamole from the build your guacamole menu. Appetizers were great.
As for dinner we ordered the Carnitas ,(braised pork with gauc, fresh salsa verde, white onion, cilrantro, and chicharrones) and the Pollo Asado, (grilled chicken, avocado,white onion, queso fresco, crema, serrano, and cilrantro) both were great. I must take my hat off to the Carnitas, it was special my personal favorite and the best I have ever had.
I will be back again on my next visit, maybe even twice.
