A taco place that has 5 stars with over 100 reviews? Obviously ... had to check it out. 

First let me say, I don't know about the authenticity of these tacos. The corn tortilla was ok, the flavors of the meat(s) were a little off in my opinion and their spicy meats were seemingly ... a cover for bad quality meat.

However, $7 for 5 street tacos is a great place, and they have a large selection of salsas to go with these so you can be sure to find something you like.

They don't have the traditional meats, except for maybe Asada (carne asada) and Carnitas but the description is so bizarre that you won't really know what it is you're getting. But hey, they let you try the meats before you order so that's a plus. Fast, friendly service.
