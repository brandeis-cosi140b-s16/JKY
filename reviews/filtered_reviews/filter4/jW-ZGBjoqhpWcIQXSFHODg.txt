The name Pedro's always seems to come up when searching for good Mexican food in Phoenix, but I never quite made it there due to its proximity to where I live and work.  That changed the other night when my friend convinced me to go car shopping with her and we passed it while driving to the dealership.  After a long, frustrating process at the dealership (what car buying experience doesn't fit that category) we were hungry and her baby needed to eat so we wanted to go somewhere close by, so we thought we would give it a try!  

It was about 7:30 on a Monday night, and there were about 5 other tables of people that seemed to be regulars.  We weren't sure what to expect from the outside of the building, and its location, but inside was clean with some kitchy decor.  The menu was vast and had all my favorite dishes...it was so hard to choose!  Ultimately I got a combo plate that included a bean tostada, cheese enchilada and a shredded beef flauta with beans (I opted for no rice).

The chips that came out first were delicious, hot, crisp and lightly salted, they were some of the best I have had.  The chunky salsa was good, but a bit on the sweet side, but it was perfect once I mixed in some of the hot sauce.  I really liked how they have you little bowls for your salsa, plates and salsa just don't mix!

The food came out fast and was piping hot....I tested the beans, my benchmark for Mexican food, and they were delicious!  Creamy, salty and rich, they were really good beans!  The enchilada was good, but I did feel the sauce was a bit on the thin side.  The beef in the flauta was delicious, really flavorful, it didn't even need sauce!  My friend had a burrito that she also enjoyed.

Our pit stop at Pedro's was made out of desperation, but we walked away happy and satisfied and considering a return trip.  When we paid the cashier told us that they had been there for 51 years, I hope I make it back before they are there another 51 years!
