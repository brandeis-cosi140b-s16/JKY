Located in the Hawaiian Marketplace, the tacos carnitas here is soooo good, super juicy! And no, I was not drunk when I had them, so if you are, I'm sure they'll be a mouthful of juicy meat delight! I'm sad they were out of al pastor when I went at 2pm in the day... also was VERY hot inside. $2 tacos is a good deal though for something on the strip, they've got a great selection of fountain drinks so battle the heat. Plus the $10 for $15 Yelp deal was the icing on the cake. I'd definitely come back here
