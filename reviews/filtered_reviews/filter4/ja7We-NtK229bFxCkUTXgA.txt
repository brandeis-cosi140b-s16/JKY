I met up with some coworkers for a happy hour, and even though I used to live at Dobson & Warner, I hadn't previously ventured to the Sandbar. I arrived early just after the start of happy hour and had no trouble finding a parking spot or a nice table on the patio - across from the fire pit, in the sand, near an umbrella. Perfect. 

During happy hour they had $2.50 Dos Ambers and $4 frozen marguerites. I started with both. The waitress was cool and took excellent care of me all evening - can't remember her name, but the ticket read "Smiles". The drinks kept coming, as did the friends, and just a couple of raindrops too. It was an excellent bar for people watching and everyone was friendly.  With the beer, the sand, the reggae it was a very good time. It was my first time there, but I will definitely be back.
