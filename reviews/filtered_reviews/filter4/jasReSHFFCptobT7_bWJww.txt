Really happy there is a Mexican restaurant on the Strip that actually has vegan options.

So my friend and I went here after looking at countless reviews for vegan restaurants.  The abidance is rather chill (great for a big group since it looks like a bar-type of restaurant).  

My friend ordered the vegan fajitas with the fake chicken and I ordered the vegan tacos with cabbage and avocado.  I am not a huge fan of fake meats but my friend LOVES it and was really happy with his order. I tried the veggies from his fajitas and the flavoring was VERY GOOD.  Mine, however, was a bit too lemony.  I ended up finishing it but compared to the flavor of my fianc√©'s dish, I was a bit disappointed.  Next time we go here, I will order the fajitas with just veggies.  

Overall, though, the service was very good and we were happy to have found a hidden restaurant with some cool vegan options.  :)
