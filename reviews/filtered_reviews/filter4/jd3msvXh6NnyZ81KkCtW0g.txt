Came here for lunch at a co-worker's suggestion and was pleasantly surprised.  Always love when you find a place after absolutely no expectations or preconceived notions.

The menu is as small as the place and pretty much rotates a couple of proteins (carne asada or pastor) within a few formats, and that's it.  Who am I to suggest messing with success - the food was freshly prepared, flavorful and fast.  I had the carne asada quesadilla and a basket of chips and guacamole - $15 (!) but the amount was enough for two to share, so not that big of a deal there.  The quesadilla was unlike one that I'd had before, with finely shredded lettuce, onion and caramelized onions in the interior - a novel concept for me, but a good idea in terms of letting the carne asada steal the show.  Moist and well-seasoned - it provided a moment of taste-bud joy.

Can't give 5 stars only because a) I was not so bowled over by the food that I'd make a special trip here and b) the smell of ceviche almost knocked me down the moment that I set foot in the place.  Don't get me wrong - I love ceviche.  I just don't want the smell of seafood dripping from my pores while I'm eating.  Thank god they have an outdoor patio to eat at.

I'm not at all ambivalent about this place, though - will definitely return.
