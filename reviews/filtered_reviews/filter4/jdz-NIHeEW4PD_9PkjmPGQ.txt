Quirky, cheap, fun place.
Super cheap draft beer.

The food is pretty good too, I like the pork tacos.... 
Only complaint is that their queso is a bit thin and bland....

Now, don't get me wrong, I wouldn't travel specifically to come here, by any means.  But since my office is right next door, it's my favorite go to place!
