I've been here a few times - just about every time I come to Vegas because my boyfriend just loves this place so much.  While the place is very good it isn't authentic at all so if that's what you fancy you should really head elsewhere.  I've tried the salads which are actually both tasty and fresh.  I've had the combo plate as well which comes with a chicken tamale, shredded beef enchilada, taco, rice, and beans.  It comes with a lot of food but it isn't the best thing ever.  The best thing on the menu would have to be the shrimp tacos.  They come with a pineapple like salsa on top which puts it over the top.  Highly recommended.
