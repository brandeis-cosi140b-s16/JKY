I love coming here, especially in the warmer months. This place has one of the best outside areas in Pittsburgh. Perfect for hanging out and relaxing with friends on the weekend or after work.

Tacos - so freakin' flavorsome! I licked the juice running down my hand...
Cocktails - sooo very very tasty! There's no skimping out on the alcohol here and fresh herbs make all the difference. The list is diverse with something for everyone.

However, there are two down sides. Firstly,  the service is poor.  We waited nearly 10 mins for a waitress to give us menus and water. Secondly, there is ONE restroom stall. Enough said for females.
