Best thing about Cafe Rio are the homemade tortillas.  They roll them out and grill them right in front of you.  They are really really good.   Wish I could buy a pack of them to take home.

The Barbacoa pork was very tasty also.  The pulled pork is mixed with a sweet spicy sauce.  I ordered a burrito stuffed with it, and the wife ordered a salad topped with it.  Her dressing was so good, a creamy tomatillo dressing.   They stuff the burrito and top the salad with rice, beans, and pico.

I would definitely come back for more pork, creamy dressing and especially the tortillas.
