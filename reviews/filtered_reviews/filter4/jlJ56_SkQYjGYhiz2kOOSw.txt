Come here and get this: Pork Shank Pibil. The pork was extremely tender. i was very happy with this dish. i was not expecting anything special but to my surprise the this had loads of flavor. The black beans are not your average black beans either. Nice presentation on the plate, and I love how there was no rice, which often dominates at these fancier Mex places. As for other things the guac ingredient include sun-dried tomatoes which gave it a different refreshing taste. Service is nothing special here.  Margarita is a good size, but nothing special.  They need more specialy drinks eveything is tequila.   But food surprising good.
