Thanks to mgr Jason and server Nicole, I am happy to update my review of SumoMaya. Took our daughter who is visiting from Austin (quite the foodie-scene where she lives and even she was impressed) last night.  Waited a few minutes with an 8:45 reservation on a Friday night. The place was PACKED. Jason made a special effort to make sure this visit went well (first time, not-so-much). Started with pomegranate guacamole, which was delicious (though very few Pom seeds) and Korean beef tacos--a huge hit. Hubby's fried rice went over well and sushi was delish and fresh. Seasonal mushrooms on the side were worth the effort as we all enjoyed them. I've had the Tamarind Shrimp both times and it's time to try something else. It's good, but very rich and salty. This is a fun and hip place and I love the funky decor. Looking forward to returning and bringing friends along to share more interesting options.
