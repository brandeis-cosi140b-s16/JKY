Some bars treat their food menu as an afterthought. That isn't the case at Loco Patron. Fajitas, quesadillas, salt and pepper wings...all very nice. Perhaps my favorite meal at Loco is brunch, though. I love their divorced eggs with enchilada sauce. It pairs well with their habanero bloody Marys.

Drinks are reasonably priced and service is outstanding. I hosted a pretty large group at Loco Patron on a football saturday. The restaurant was very busy, but we still had outstanding service. No one in my party had an empty drink in his/her hand for very long, which is quite impressive given the crowd and the propensity for my friends to consumer alcohol. Long after that event, I'm still having people say what a great time they had at Loco.

In short, my favorite place on Mill.
