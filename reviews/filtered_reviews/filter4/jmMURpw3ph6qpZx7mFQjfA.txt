I agree that this place is underrated. it is in Henderson inside of a mall but don't get it twisted this place has some of the best Mexican food around. They make you fresh tortillas and I also love their chips. today we had the mix grill fajita plate and oh mahi goodness. Everything was cooked perfectly. Usually food of this cuisine tend to over cook  the seafood and steak items. A+ 

I ordered a drink but the waitress totally forgot about it and it was way to sweet. Only reason for 4 stars
