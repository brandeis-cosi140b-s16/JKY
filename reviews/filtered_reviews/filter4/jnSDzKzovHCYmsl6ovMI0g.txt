It was good, but not quite good enough for the high prices. Also, my sister got the tacos, and they were literally the smallest tacos I had ever seen. She actually had to order another item off of the menu. My noodles were delicious, but a tad overpriced. The sushi is scrumptious, though! The ambience and service were very nice, though.
