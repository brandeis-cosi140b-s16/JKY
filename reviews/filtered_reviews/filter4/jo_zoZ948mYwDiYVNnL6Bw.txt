I tried this place out based on reviews I read from multiple sources.  Luckily one of the reviews mentioned that it was right next to a circle K, this made it fairly easy to spot.

I ordered the 3 tacos combination plate with carne asada, carnitas, and lengua.  All were delicious, though I have had better asada.  I chose not to partake in anything from the condiment bar, that will be on the next visit.  The beans and rice were good.  I was extremely disappointed that they did not sell beer, and I can't believe that a fast-food Mexican place closes at 12 am.  This would be the perfect stop after getting kicked out of the bars at 2 am if it was open.

All in all, great choice for fast food Mexican, but I would not say it was extraordinary.
