This is our go-to place for Mexican/fusion-y tacos, mostly for proximity and ambiance. I'm sure there's somewhere more authentic and more savory, but for Red Rock, it'll do!

We've never strayed from our usual order of chips, guacamole, salsa trio, and tacos.

Always, always get the "tradicional" guacamole. A previous review stated it was too small? I find this incredibly hard to believe as we always take the guacamole home after eating a fair amount at the restaurant. Once with friends (and the server's very enthusiastic suggestion) we tried the "Tocino," but it was not to our liking. A little too odd with the texture.

Our favorite salsas are the "habanero," which has a respectable spice level, and the "tomatillo," which is refreshing and herby with the chili and cilantro.

My #1 taco is the "langosta," usually a buttery lobster. The recent configuration had an addition of a green chili sauce, which I definitely enjoyed. The next favorite would be the "espada," swordfish, and "carne," beef. I'm a little sad to say I don't care for the shrimp tacos. Something about it tastes too earthy. The chipotle mojo, perhaps?
