This was my first time here and I was very surprised how long the line was, but it moved quickly. It's similar to Chipotle or Qdoba except they have more people working and more fish items. 

I got the 2 taco meal with barbacoa for the meat. Very different from barbacoa I've had at other places. It was sweet and kind of sugary. I really liked it and would get it again. The tacos come with lettuce, cilantro and pico de gallo with a side of rice and beans. 

They rush you through the line a little. They didn't offer cheese or sour cream, just asked if I wanted lettuce and pico. Probably a good thing though because I would've added those at it wouldn't have worked with the taste of the meat.
