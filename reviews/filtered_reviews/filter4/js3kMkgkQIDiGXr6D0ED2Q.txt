Came here for lunch during the week, and had no complaints. The place was nearly empty, so service was great, the food arrived rather quickly, we had no issues getting beverages. I noticed that there were many negative reviews that mentioned lack of A/C, but it was 100 deg outside when I came here, and the A/C seemed to be working fine. The bartender was attractive and funny, and all the females on shift were pleasant to look at, and didn't seem stuck up. I will definitely come back when in town.
