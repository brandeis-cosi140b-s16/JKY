Another "cheers" to Richardson's. My cousin took me here for the first time two years ago. I've walked away satisfied. Portions are huge so I've been able to make two meals out of one usually. The green chile potato, or GCP as the kids call it, is really yummy. Last time I went, I had the relleno platter with roasted green chiles and a small house salad. The salad was nothing special and drenched in ranch dressing. But at least the waiter was very decent in telling me that he would get me a $4 one instead of the $7 which is what's on the menu. He didn't think it was fair to not warn me how much food that would be. But the beans were very flavorful and with the rice, it certainly didn't taste like the usual heaviness that comes from something out of like an El Torito's or Chevy's. And I think everyone should try the garlic toast platter. Richardson's does a good job of setting itself apart. And the decor is inviting with the copper tables and dimmed lighting. Good for a date or just to hang with a friend.
