I've been here about 4 times now. I love this place. The name has changed, they've been serving alcohol for a while now, there's a new location in Glendale (I need to go), and the menu has expanded but isn't quite represented online yet. Even the physical menus can be different. The one I had had a few more items on it than my friends'. The horchata is still the best I've ever had. The margaritas are so freaking good.

I tried the marlin taco that wasn't there last time I visited. I love trying things I've never had before. Marlin is an odd fish. Their preparation makes it look and taste almost like pork. It's just... different. Still good though!

My friend got the veggie burro. She said it was pretty tasty, but a little on the bland side. We agreed that it can be hard to make vegetarian food flavorful at times. She liked the salsa bar because she could add a different flavor between bites.

They get slammed on weekends. I was here at 7pm on a Friday. They need more than 2 people serving and clearing on weekends. When every table is packed there's almost no room to move. Getting to the salsa bar can be pretty awkward.
