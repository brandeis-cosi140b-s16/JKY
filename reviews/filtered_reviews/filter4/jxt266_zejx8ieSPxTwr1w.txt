Don't worry about the culture shock. Give the place a try. The carne asada torta is solidly good.  The roll is fresh and soft and tasty. The meat is flavorfull. 

Try the quesadilla on the hand/home made corn tortilla. Thr carne asada shines and the estillo del rey with extra cheese and goodies was super good.

Really different in a good way.
