Cafe rio has delicious food. I've tried half of the menu and have not been disappointed with the taste of anything. However today at 630pm it was super busy. I've never seen it like that. After waiting for about 25 mins in line they managed to loose my burrito. I had to wait for another burrito to be made. But non the less, I love their food. Could do away with some of the sloppy workers tonight dropping food all over and not one had a smile on their face.
