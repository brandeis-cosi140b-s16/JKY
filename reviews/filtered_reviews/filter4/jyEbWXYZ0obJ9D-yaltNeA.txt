I absolutely LOVE the ambiance of Taco Guild. Set in an old church, it has beautiful stained glass windows and various eclectic pieces that give it so much personality. If you're heading downtown for the evening, this is the perfect Midtown dinner spot prior to your night on the town! 

I love their Sunday Happy Hour from 2 PM -Close. They have $5 drink specials and their daily taco is only $1.99! & Honestly, the daily taco is usually my favorite one in the mix. :) The Guild Duo is a must {guacamole & fire roasted green chile queso combo}. My mouth is watering just thinking about the queso! The street corn is also a winner! It makes the perfect side to your delicious tacos. 

We will be back soon to try out more of their fabulous menu items!
