Great Mex joint with a halfway decent tequila selection, especially considering this is West Pennsy Pittsburgh and not So Cal or somewhere more deeply Latino influenced. Great pre-game place before moseying over to PNC Park or happy hour for the Golden Triangle crowd.

The carnitas flour tacos with pastor were excellent, just ask for the Pastor tacos from the dinner menu - highly recommended with a Modelo Especial to wash 'er down and a Cazadores or Camareno reposado for the proper finishing touch. Ariba!
