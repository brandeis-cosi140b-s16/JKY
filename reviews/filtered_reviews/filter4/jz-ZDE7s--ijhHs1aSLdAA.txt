I love Someburros, although I have to admit I always order the same thing (combo #1.) The chips and salsa are fantastic. If you like it hot order the salsa verde sometime. 

Combo #1 includes: cheese enchilada, taco (choice of chicken or shredded beef), and beans. I like to smother the whole plate in Someburros red salsa and then dig in! Everything tastes fresh and comforting. 

The restaurant on Baseline and Mill is my favorite, but it's small and can get crowded. The place is always neat, clean and friendly. It's not a fast food joint, nor is it fancy dining--somewhere in between.

One last note: you probably won't see it on the menu but they do serve bottled beer.
