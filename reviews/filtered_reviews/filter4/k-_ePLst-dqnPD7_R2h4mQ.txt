Visited mad mex today for the first time since I've been in college, and we went at like 2:30 pm on a Monday, it was completely packed, but we got seated right away and didnt wait very long for a waiter. Ordered a red sangria, the pickadippa app, a cup of tortilla soup and the original mad mex burrito (needless to say I brought home multiple boxes). The sangria was delicious (and cheap -$5!), we got the original salsa, guacamole and hummus, and all three were delicious. The tortilla soup came out not hot but they took it off my bill and the manager was more than accommodating. The food was great, and we got student discounts (half off food from 2-4) as well as the yummy sangrias. Can't wait to come back for Wednesday happy hour and late night menu! Definitely one of my new favorite places!
