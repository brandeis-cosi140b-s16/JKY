I'm shocked I forgot to write a review on this place. Excellent, innovative mexican food. The margaritas are amazing and there are so many to chose from! Wonderful salsa's, crispy chips; the total package. Tia Rosa's had become a staple when I lived in AZ, I'd go with my parents, my friends, anyone. Vegetarians can rely on their black beans and most waiters will let you customize your order (I've had black bean tacos before, delish!). This is fresh, smokey and smart mexican food, something new from all those chains. Beware the large parties with several kids, is it located in Mesa after all.
