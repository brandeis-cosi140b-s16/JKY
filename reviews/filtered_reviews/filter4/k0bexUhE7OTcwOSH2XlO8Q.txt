My wife and I went to this restaurant just a few days ago.  We were very pleased at the service, the food, and the price.  I have really been surprised at some of the reviews for this restaurant on Yelp, as our experience seems to have been better than some others have had.  I got cheese enchiladas, which came with rice and beans, and it was delicious!  The chips were fresh and the salsa was not bad.  The menu is packed full of New Mexico style mexican food, so you should expect that.  I am new to Arizona, and this will be a place I definitely want to go back to.  I have no idea why there are so many bad reviews on here, but we were more than satisfied with the food, and the staff was very nice and prompt.  We give it four stars and recommend you give it a try.  (And stay away from El Palacio, in Chandler, as we ate there tonight and it was horrible.  I have another review for that place).
