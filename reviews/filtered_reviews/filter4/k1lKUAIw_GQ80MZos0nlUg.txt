These are the best, freshest tacos I have had in Las Vegas. It is ALWAYS packed in here and the food is ALWAYS good. 

I HIGHLY recommend:
1. Carne Asada quesadilla - PACKED with steak on a soft thick tortilla with lots cheese, pico and guacamole.

2. Buche tacos - pork stomach that has been simmered for HOURS until tender and highly seasoned. 

3. Spicy pork taco - cut right off the spit fresh for you.They also add grilled pineapple at your request. Excellent

4. Tongue taco - seasoned and tender. 

I personally think these are BETTER than most of the tacos I had in Tijuana. But the sign here says they are from Tijuana so I must have missed them. Hard to remember anything in Tijuana actually. I could have ate here and just forgot from all the tequila I drank while I was there. Who knows?!

This place is open TWENTY FOUR HOURS!!!
