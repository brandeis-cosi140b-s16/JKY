Cafe Rio used to be right near my work at 48th and Ray, but they moved to Gilbert so I am pretty bummed.

The salads are amazing, and you should DEFINITELY give one a try. They take a fresh homemade tortilla and warm it up, then layer it with veggie friendly beans, fresh lettuce, cheese, etc etc... and it is topped with THE most AMAZING cilantro dressing. 

I honestly crave this dressing and really wish that I could find a good bottle of it somewhere.

I cannot attest to the decor or service because I have not visited the area, but I would definitely grab that salad if I were ever in the area.
