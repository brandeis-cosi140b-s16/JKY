Went here with some friends after seeing its Yelp ranking. I agree completely. The food was really good and the prices were juuust right. The food definitely isn't the healthiest, but honestly when it's that good it's hard to complain about it.
I have eaten here several times since my first visit and never once have been disappointed.
