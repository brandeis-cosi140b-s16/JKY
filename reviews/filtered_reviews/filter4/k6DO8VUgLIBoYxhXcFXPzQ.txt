Cut to the chase: we were lucky and came early on a Wednesday, so the recommended reservations weren't needed, but you can absolutely see why they are. The chorizo stuffed chicken was out of this world; if it's any indication of what the rest of the menu is like, you can see how this place would be churning on Friday and Saturday nights. They're close by the Cubs' spring training home at Hohokam, so it was a quick drive there from the park.

The photo is wrong; the place has been painted a deep cerulean blue.
