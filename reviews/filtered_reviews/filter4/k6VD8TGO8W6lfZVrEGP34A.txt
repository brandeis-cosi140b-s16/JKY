The best thing about this place...the papas bravas!!! I love their roasted red potatoes - very well-seasoned and delicious. Dip those babies into the spicy mayo sauce to seal the deal. It's one of the tapas I highly recommend trying at least once. 

As for the tacos, there is enough toppings for each taco. The shrimp tacos were alright. The steak tacos (carne asada style) is one of their top tacos; the meat is definitely tender. My favorite sauce is the inferno, spicy with good flavors, that gives the perfect heat to my tacos. The packaging for the tacos is a little bulky, so expect a lot of trash if you're ordering a lot.  

I'm a coffee addict. The fact that this place is located right next to Dutch Brothers makes it super convenient. They have a drive thru, or you can walk up to order at the window. There are some tables located outside where you can eat there. No seats available to eat inside though. They have a restroom located outside next to the pick-up window. 

I have yet to try their breakfast burritos. I heard they're pretty bomb from one of the workers at Dutch Brothers.
