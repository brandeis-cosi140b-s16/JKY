Decided to check out Braddah's today on account of a Groupon I purchased. It was good, but not exceptional.  I had the bowl mixed with chicken and steak.  The steak was awesome, the chicken was ok/forgettable. It's different to have something along the lines of Chipotle, but infused with sweetness. Not really my cup of tea as I tend to like my sweets and savory separate. Had the chips and guac, ok but the guac could use a little more flavor. Location was clean and nice, the girl who was working was very friendly and helpful. Worth a try I would say.
