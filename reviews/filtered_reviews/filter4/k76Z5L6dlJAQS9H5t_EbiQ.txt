I like the way she rock, her hips
Them rockin hips
Told her we can take off like rocket ships
Straight jacket jeans, you look crazy in 'em....at ISLA MEXICAN KITCHEN! - The Dream (rockin' that)

First the funny part about this place: it's located close to the cirque du soleil theatre and possibly the buffet so when i saw a hugeeee line outside i was like what the heck...luckily it was for the cirque show and MAYBE a few stragglers thinking it was the buffet line haha! Yeah this place wasn't busy at all so immediate seating cha ching! Normally i wouldn't mind waiting but not this time...mexican food can't wait! I guess it could cuz the waiter was a turtle with not that many people in the restaurant, it SEEMED slow too. Anyways, the restaurant itself had a good vibe to it with a bar in front and table seating in the back. Ordered the seafood enchilada since i hardly ever see it on a menu and it was well crafted i have to say. I don't remember exactly what was in it (vegas baby!) but i do remember there were 4-5 seafood ingredients including scallops which made for a tasty combination. There weren't many mexican options on the strip but this was one of em and it was very reasonable in terms of food/prices.

Food: 4 stars --- Service: 3 stars --- Atmosphere: 4 stars --- Price(value): 4 stars
