Thanks you google we found this place as a cheap place to go for breakfast! We both got the special which was $4.29 but came with 2 eggs, bacon, ham or sausage. And your choice of Texas toast or tortillas... 

My wife and I both went with toast. She got bacon and I went with ham! Very good for the price. 

The service was decent as well, didn't have to wait for anything so that's a plus.

They also have .99 bloody Mary's or coffee. I went with the bloody Mary's.. It wasn't bad for .99. Could really taste the alcohol but what do you expect for .99... The coffee wasn't too bad either for the price. It's much more reasonable than $3 coffee from Starbucks..  

All in all our meal was $12 and it was the cheapest bfast we had. Even McDonald's was a lot more.

For the price and value, it worth a visit.
