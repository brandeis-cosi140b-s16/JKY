Thanks to yelp we found this authentic Mexican restaurant... We were weary about the wait but it wasn't that bad.  The food came pretty quick - service from the wait staff was great, the hostess not so much. 

So first you get some super spicy salsa with chips and already, there is a party in your mouth.  I ordered the Adovado ribs and it was ultra spicy and ultra good, literally melts in  your mouth and my buddy ordered the tacos (just okay)...  and I got a yummie Margarita - it was a night club in mouth and with the noise, seriously could not concentrate... 

Very good - will return if we ever go back for Cubs Spring Training...
