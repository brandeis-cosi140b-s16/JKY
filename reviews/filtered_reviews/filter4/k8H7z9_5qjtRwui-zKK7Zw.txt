Inexpensive, casual place for a great burrito.  I have been going here for over 10 years and I've always had a great meal.  It is a little bit of a hike for me to get there but well worth it!  The chicken & beef burritos are very tasty and the salsa is awesome (they have many to choose from). I recently tried the fish tacos for the first time and they were also very good.  I highly recommend this place - the food is great!
