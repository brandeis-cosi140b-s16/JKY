The enchiladas poblano (mole) will change your life. Seriously! After spending a Sunday at Carrawinds, my family and I were famished. With a party of nine, we wanted something good, filling, and inexpensive. I whipped out my phone, pulled up my Yelp app, and searched for best Mexican restaurant near our current location. Thank you sweet Yelpers for sending us to this place! The restaurant space is on the small side, so we had a bit of a wait. Luckily there were a few available chairs at the bar and a few empty seats on the patio. The men opened bar tabs and sipped on brewskis while the waitresses cleared tables and made space for our large party. Once seated, our drink orders were promptly taken. Shortly after, drinks were delivered and food orders were immediately taken. Everyone enjoyed their meal! I accidentally ordered the wrong sauce for my enchiladas; since I was starving, I decided I would just keep them. After a bite or two I realized the sauce was far too spicy and acidic for my palate to enjoy. I called our waitress over and apologetically explained that my enchiladas were too spicy to enjoy. She, without hesitation, said "Don't worry! I will bring you the correct enchiladas. There might be a wait since we're packed. Is that okay?" I replied yes. Thinking it would take a while to receive my new dish, I decided to enjoy my rice and beans as I waited. Not even five minutes after removing my old dish, the waitress returned with freshly prepared enchiladas. Holy MOLE!!!! :)

Whenever I'm in the Charlotte area, I will be sure to return. The food is fresh, authentic, palate pleasing, affordable, and the customer service is great! That's a four-star visit in my opinion. And judging by the other comments, my fellow Yelpers agree!
