My husband & I were staying at the golden nugget down town Las Vegas & we were craving Mexican food but not sure where to go. I read the reviews & sounded great so we decided to give it a try. The staff very friendly, great food ,mango margarita really good, carnitas burrito/fajitas was so full of flavor, my husband loved it! Nothing bad to say about this place at all, to bad we didn't live closer we would definatly be back soon!!! Highly recommended
