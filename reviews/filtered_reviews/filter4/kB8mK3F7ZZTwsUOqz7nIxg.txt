Dona Marias on Tenaya has been a family favorite of ours for years. My kids love the soup and the fresh made tortillas. They are a little pricey so it is a sometimes treat. (Like once a week if I can bribe my wife into it with a grande Midori Margarita on the rocks)

I highly recommend their grande margaritas. They are bueno-tastic!.
