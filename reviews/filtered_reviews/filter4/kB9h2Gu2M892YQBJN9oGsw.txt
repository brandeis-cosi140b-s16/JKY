The plates here are huge, you get a whole lot of food for the money.  I tried the fajita enchiladas, and both the steak and chicken were quite good.  The marinade used on the meats is tasty.  The salsa was a little tame for my taste, but that is true of most places.  Overall I would not hesitate to try this place again.  They have a large menu, so there are lots of options for a future return visit.
