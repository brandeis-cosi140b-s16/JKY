Quite possibly the best street style fish taco I have had in Phoenix. The generous portion of fish was heavily seasoned and lightly breaded, the result was pure heaven. I also ordered the flour quesadilla, refried pinto beans, carne asada and al pastor tacos. The refried beans were creamy and the queso in the quesadilla was awesome. 

I washed that all down with a bottled coke and rolled myself home. You may want to give yourself some time if you come here during lunch, by 11:30 the line was out the door. Apparently I am not the only one that knows how delicious this little dive is!
