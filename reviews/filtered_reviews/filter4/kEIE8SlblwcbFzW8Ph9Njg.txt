I was first introduced to Mango's by a coworker when I was employed by a company based in downtown Mesa. After quickly tiring of all the typical stuff in the area, I was excited to try something new and he mentioned that they had great salsa and $0.99 chicken tacos from 2-4. That was all that needed to be said, as those are two of my favorite things when it comes to Mexican food. Unfortunately, they no longer do the $0.99 chicken taco special (damn you, economy! This is the only reason I can't give it a 5 star rating, it's a little pricey for what you get) but I still make it a point to stop by from time to time and grub here. The salsa is indeed quite good, and the chicken tacos (while a little on the greasy side) are worth the trip.
