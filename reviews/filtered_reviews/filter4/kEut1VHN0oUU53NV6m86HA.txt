This restaurant is located within the Miracle Mile mall on the strip. They have great drink specials and prices are far more reasonable than other places in the area. Food was served quickly and the menu selection was excellent. I easily put together a filling vegan meal. That being said, there was nothing to distinguish it from other Mexican places, but it's a good safe option which would please even the pickiest eater.
