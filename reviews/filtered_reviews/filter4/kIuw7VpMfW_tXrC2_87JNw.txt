My nacho craving was back so I decided to drive down here to get some!  I read an article online stating that the nachos at The Old Pueblo Cafe were some of the best in the West Valley.  I had to check them out and confirm that myself!  I drove down, walked inside and was told to sit wherever I wanted.  I grabbed a table outside (the outside patio area is huge btw) and was brought some chips and 2 kinds of salsa.  The chips were pretty good...thin, crispy, salted fine.  The 2 salsas were a pico de gallo and one that was in a squirt bottle...more like a hot sauce than a salsa.  They both tasted fine.  The pico was actually really good and refreshing.  I ordered a water to drink and placed my order for the Old Pueblo Nachos with shredded beef.   Here is how they were.................

Old Pueblo Nachos ($9.95)-  These things came on a massive hot plate!  These nachos had a ton of crispy and sturdy chips, pinto/refried beans, melted cheese, shredded beef, sour cream, guacamole and a little lettuce and tomatoes.  Could have done without the lettuce but I think it was just for presentation purposes anyways.  The nachos were great!  The shredded beef had a bunch of green chilis in it.  It was delicious!  The cheese was melted perfectly, the beans were hearty, and the chips were warm and crispy.  A tad bit skimp on the sour cream and guacamole but most places are like that anyways so I can't complain.  I did my best and devoured about 75% of them and was stuffed to the brim.  Definitely a delicious and plentiful order of nachos!

Service was friendly.  The waiter was very quiet and mellow and so was the lady who brought out my food.  They were both nice though and checked on me throughout my meal.  I don't know when I will be back just because it is a little bit of a drive from where I live (20 minutes or so) but the chips, nachos and service were definitely worth a return visit.
