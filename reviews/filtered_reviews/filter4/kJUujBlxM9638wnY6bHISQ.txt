This place was pretty cool and it was my first time there...surprisingly at the airport location rather than down the street at the actual location. The bartenders were nice. We had some great drinks and the food looked amazing. I would love to check out the actual location but the Phoenix airport is pretty awesome now that it has all the local restaurants in there.
