I kept reading the reviews and bookmarked this place long ago.  Their menu is simple but as soon as I walked in I knew I had to try the carne asada and a raspado for dessert.  Finally deciding on the taco combo with one carne asada and one barbacoa taco on corn tortillas.  Ordering a limeade to drink and a raspado to be made before I headed out (which the lady working the counter kindly did).  
Now this was some good carne asada and the barbacoa was meaty lean and well seasoned.  The 3 salsas were very tasty ( a red, verde/tomatillo, and a chunky roasted green chile type) The heat was perfect (too hot for some and too mild for others I am sure) but it complemented the meal perfectly.  The tacos were garnished with pico de gallo (chopped tomato, onion and cilantro) and shredded lettuce.  Topped fresh squeezed key lime and with a mix of the salsas, I eat each positioned over the rice so the juices from the meat and the salsa get soaked up by the rice.  
The beans were tasty I just wished there was more on the plate.  

The service was quick and friendly.  The restaurant was clean and casual and I loved my pineapple coconut raspado, I opted out of the ice cream being added but may have to try it that way on my next visit.  

The limeade was light, sweet and fresh.  

My next visit I am determined to get the Carne Asada burrito.
