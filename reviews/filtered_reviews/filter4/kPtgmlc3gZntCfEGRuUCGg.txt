A few weeks ago, my new boss came into town to meet with me. For dinner, she wanted a margarita and I had remembered my coworker telling me how much she  liked Nacho Daddy. Perfect time to try this place out and get my new boss a little liquored up.

So let's just say, I think I got three emails from my boss telling me how much she really  liked this place. And I agree.

As an appetizer, we ordered the nachos with filet mignon and why not since it's on the company's dime. It was really flavorful, so so good.

I made the mistake of ordering the Daddy signature fish tacos. The fish was bigger than the tortilla! It was only two tacos but I could only finish one. 

My boss ordered the Daddy signature chicken tacos. It was a little too spicy for her that she could only finish the one. 

I'm looking forward to going back and trying the other nachos and a flight of tequilas.
