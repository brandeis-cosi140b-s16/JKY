We have been going to La Pi単ata for over 3 years now... Wait I meant 3 months now! Where have we been? Oh yeah we lived in Scottsdale. Now we live on the west side right up the street from La Pi単ata and that's the best part! The first time we checked it out we were hooked! 

Waiters and staff are friendly. Decor seems ok to me. pi単atas hanging from the ceiling makes sense. But it's the food! Just the right amount of spices. Tastes fresh. I love the chimichangas. Shredded beef is awesome. My wife is the picky one though about her Mexican food. Big thumbs up from her too. She cannot decide what she likes best so she gets the combination with enchilada, tamale and a taco! Her only critique is she thinks the bean burros are pricey. But it's so good!

Now for our daughter's review who only likes bean and cheese burros. "These are the best I've ever had! From now on when we get take-out this is all I want!"
Her review should mean a lot... Like getting 5 stars from Wolfgang Puck! 

So glad we have La Pi単ata so close to us and look forward to eating there three times a month for the next three years! (After 3 years I am sure we'll move again).
