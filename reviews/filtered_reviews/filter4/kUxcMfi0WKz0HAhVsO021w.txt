While I was not that thrilled with the overall Mexican/Chinese concept or the decor of the place, the tacos I had were excellent.  I had the cochinita taco, barbacoa de res, and the carnitas taco.  I was surprised at how good and how different they all tasted.  Pass on the fries with the mole poblano sauce however-that was a miss.
