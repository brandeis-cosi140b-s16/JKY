I had been craving guacamole for about a week and me and my sister decided on Cantina to help me sate that craving.  we got there around 7 and it was pretty busy, but I had made a reservation before we left the house.  They have $10 off pitchers of any margaritas on Thursday's, so we got the house and my guac to start.

Pitcher was huge!!  I really wasn't expecting it to be so big and with just the 2 of us it was too much.  We were both so full from liquids that I barely ate dinner, which was the barbacoa.  Guac was pretty good, maybe too much lime juice though.  Barbacoa was good, never had it before but it did seem a bit dry to me, still tasty though.  Sister got garlic shrimp, tasted like scampi but they were yummy.  Dessert was quatros leches, good but they put a meringue top on it and it was not needed and we scraped it off.

Our server was great and made sure our water was never empty and we had plenty of chips.  Only thing that was annoying, and is totally my fault, I had a Citi Pass coupon and didn't realize till the next day so we could have gotten 1 entree freeish.  Oh well my fault for never remembering to check that book!!
