I've had this place bookmarked for ages, but despite driving by on many occasions I never forced myself to try Carlito's, until today.

My family is originally from New Mexico, so I grew up on green chile and sopapillas. I guess I was a little nervous that I would be disappointed by Carlito's as I have been by New Mexican restaurants in the past. I'm happy to say that Carlito's exceeded my expectations.

After seeing Jaime W's taco Tuesday treats on the newsfeed, I decided it was time to finally bite the bullet and give Carlito's a try. I ordered a Navajo taco with pork verde to go. On the ride back to my office, I couldn't resist trying some of the pork. It was absolutely delicious. Perfectly cooked and really spicy. The fry bread was a little soggy, but it was probably because I took it to go. I look forward to trying the rest of their menu. I'm looking forward to bringing my mom along with me next time to get her more expert opinion on the place.

They also roast Hatch chile during the season, sell pinons by the pound and offer parking lot barbecue parties from time to time when you check out their web site and facebook page.
