People get fussy about Mexican restaurants. Is it authentic (which region?)? Is it Americanized? Is it just like the Mexico they saw when they went on vacation? Are they from SoCal or Texas?  There's a place for platters of rice/beans and cheese covering 'something' underneath served with chips from a bag and red or green sauce. Then there are places that seem more real. 

La Mestiza is one. It's a notch or two up in feel and decor from Tac.Guadalajara and a bit fancier and pricier that La Guanjuatence. The menu is more limited and they seem to want to focus on doing a few things really well. They succeed. They have Negra Modelo on tap, always a good sign. Real Margaritas (talking to you La Guanjuatence!) are a win. The chips were freshly cooked, hot and delish!  Spousal Unit had the Chicken Mole enchiladas. I love mole. Theirs was good and she loved it. A little too sweet for my tastes and it could have been spicier (I say that a lot in Madison). I had the Yucatan classic, Cochinita Pibil. Nicely presented and flavorful. 

Unlike some of my favorite Mexican places, this is a place you could go on a date.
