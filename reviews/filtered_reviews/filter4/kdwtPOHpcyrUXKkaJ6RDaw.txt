Review is for the Bar/Lounge are ONLY.

I ended up there with the hubby and another couple after spending way too much time @ Chateau last Friday night. We were drawn to this place because of ample seating, DJ, and the hookah. I know, I know what a combo right Mexican restaurant with Hookah. But whateves its Vegas I guess everything goes huh. 

Atmosphere was chill and kick back, just the way I like it. I only wish we would have tried this place earlier in the week. Mixed drinks we're typical Vegas watered down and overpriced. But we had lots of fun here. People watching, was entertaining lets just keep it at that. LOL

We'll have to come back and try the food on my next visit.
