I got the house margarita and it was fantastic! Nothing special about it, just plain good. The guacamole was great, but had one to many onions in it for my taste. Plates are huge, so I would suggest splitting. That is exactly what we did. Got the a la carte taco platter with 6 different tacos...mushroom and queso, fish with mango, chicken, beef, pork, and rajas with queso. Light, fresh, and good. Great midday snack before we headed back out onto the Vegas Strip. Love the iron gates, columns, and tiling...located right on the Venetian's canal.
