Went to Joyride for the first time on Sunday, around brunch time.  Sat at the bar, ordered a cold Negro Modelo - they only offer it on draft.  Staff was very friendly and engaging. The place is super cute, love the outside patio, good blend of background music.  For the food, I started with guacamole, chips and salsa - all were tasty.  The salsa had a nice kick.  Tried the shrimp, fish and ahi tacos.  The shrimp was flavorful, fish appeared slightly under cooked - so that lost points.  The ahi was by far the winner - amazing actually.  Will definitely go back, thrilled to see more restaurants in Central Phx.
