Decided to veer from our typical breakfast burrito spot and try something new this morning. I must say, this was one tasty breakfast burrito! My hubby and I both had a bacon, potato and egg burrito which came with beans on it as well. I wasn't too sure about the refried beans, but it added a nice texture and another level of flavor along with the perfectly spiced hot sauce. The potatoes were basically French fries, which in my opinion made it especially sinful...god I wish they were open late night for that vodka fueled burrito fix! All and all, we both inhaled our breakfast and vowed to return for more next weekend :)
