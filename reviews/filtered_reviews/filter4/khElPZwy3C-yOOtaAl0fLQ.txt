Our hotel concierge suggested this place as a destination due to our large party size, and we were very happy she did.  The chips were outstanding, and we all have had our share of chips and salsa.  Our waiter was superb and his recommendations were all spot-on.  Everything ordered was fabulous.  

El Zocalo is quite the happening destination in not-so-sleepy historic Chandler; there were promgoers, oldsters and hipsters inside, outside on the patio, and lining up to get in the door.  It's loud and fun.
