This was my first experience with Cuban food and my goodness, it was tasty!

We sat down on a Friday night before seeing a movie and it was an excellent decision. Not too crowded and I immediately loved the atmosphere and lighting. Our waiter was extremely helpful and pleasant. After telling him that I had no idea what to order and that it was my first time, he made a bunch of awesome recommendations and explained some of the dishes. 

We ordered an off the menu special appetizer - meatballs covered in some type of spicy-but-sweet barbecue sauce. There were four and they were a bit small, so I thought they were overpriced....but STILL DELICIOUS!

I told our waiter that I wanted steak and he recommended the Bistec De Palomilla, which was basically marinated steak, thinly sliced, with onions all over it. I chose to have their special beans and rice mix (cooked with bits of pork). My girlfriend ordered the Ropa Vieja. Our food came out very quickly and I couldn't get over how something so simple could be so delicious! There was nothing at all fancy about the steak, but the flavors were unbelievable. I really enjoyed my dish! 

We also ordered a side of plantains, which was great. I as apprehensive because I don't understand the concept of cooked bananas, but they were a very complimentary taste to the steak and rice/beans. 

The wait staff was friendly and I never had to ask for a drink refills. 

I'll definitely be back!
