I've been to the Blue Adobe Grille a few times and really like it.  Food is spicy and good.  The salsa is amazing and fresh.  Love their pulled pork.  Really good.  The atmosphere is also pleasant and nice.  The service has been OK.  I can see why some people have said bad things but it didn't bother me much.  I'll continue coming back.
