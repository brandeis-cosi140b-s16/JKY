Our first visit. A nice place with a charming al fresco patio - a good place to take out-of-town visitors for a Southwestern experience. Since it's on the Dreamy Draw cycling route and very close to the Arizona Canal cycling path, a fine place to stop and lunch if one's on a ride in the area. The flour chips and salsa were delicious, the fish tacos and the pollo fundido were yum, and ice cold Modelo amber is on tap! Service was fast and attentive - my one complaint is that while a bottle of cold water hit the table immediately, water glasses never did appear.  I suspect that milady wife and I will become regular clients. Food - three and a half stars, service four, and ambience a solid five.
