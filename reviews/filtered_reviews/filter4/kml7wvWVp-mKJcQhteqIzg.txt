Living around the corner from here for years, I just visited it last week for the first time. The service was awesome. I couldnt drink my water fast enough because our waiter kept filling it at the halfway point. Portions were huge... especially for the money. I had the fajitas, which I think were $12, and that lasted me for 3 meals. The biggest downfall was flavor, or lack there of. It was good, but seemed like it was missing something. I will be back to try some other stuff from the menu, and some drinks.
