Greasy "traditional" American Mex is not really my cup of tea, so I would not usually choose this type of place for that reason.  However, I'm a medical sales rep, and we bring A Lot of lunches to offices.  Usually I try and steer them towards healthier fare since I have to eat lunch too, but one of my better accounts had a particular fancy for this place so I decided to be accommodating and give it a whirl.  

I ordered their party platter which feeds 25, and told them to just put an assortment of stuff on there, beef and chicken.  My total was $125 before tax, and I found this to be EXTREMELY reasonable for what I got.  They were a little slow getting my order brought out to my car, but yes, they did bring it out and load it up and I only gave them an hour notice so I won't fault them for this at all.  It was a TON of food, two huge bags of chips, 3 large containers of salsa, 1 large container of guac, 1 large container of sour cream, a tray of rice, another tray of beans, and 3 huge party platter assortments of mini chimis, mini tacos, and flautas.  Even though the food was fried, it was not terribly greasy, and I actually enjoyed it!  It was a huge hit with the office, and there was so much leftover I actually brought some back for the staff at one of my offices since coincidentally they were having Mexican potluck day and as usual, I forgot to bring something in.  They commented on how good it was too, even though it was a full hour later and I looked super thoughtful ;)

I would definitely recommend this place for other reps who do catering orders or anyone who wants to feed a large group for what I consider to be a very fair price.  Huge hit, something for everyone!
