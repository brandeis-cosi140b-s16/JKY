My husband took me to dinner here tonight for my birthday and we thought the food was delicious. He ordered the chicken fajitas and I got the New York strip with yucca fries and black beans. The atmosphere is beautiful and the service was also great. Yes a little pricey but that's to be expected. And the dessert was also very delicious !! I would recommend eating here!
