Love the chips and salsa (ask for the hot salsa). We always fight over the flour chips that they mix in with the corn. 

I usually get a combo w/shredded beef crunchy taco and red-chili soft taco. It's soooo good. I also like their spinach enchiladas w/added chicken. 

The stacked Texas enchiladas aren't always prepared exactly the same way, but I love the flavor and the hatch chilies. 

They also have great fajitas.Get the steak and shrimp combo! 

Great for kids. Great for families. We also like the Cantina on game days.
