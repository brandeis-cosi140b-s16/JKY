Quite possibly the best fish tacos I have ever tasted....2nd only to Torchy's Tacos in TX.  The flavor was outstanding (I had one salmon taco and one tuna) and the fish was grilled to perfection.  My only complaint was that when we got our food it was lukewarm...not hot at all.  Also, I ordered the coleslaw and it was slightly flavorless.
