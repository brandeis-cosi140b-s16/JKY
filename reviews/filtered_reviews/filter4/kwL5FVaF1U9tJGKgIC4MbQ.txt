I've never met a taco I didn't like, especially a fish taco, so this has been a staple place for us since they opened.

I'm watching my waistline right now, so after devouring a basket of chips I decided to order a salad. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the honey chicken spinach salad was. A bed of spinach, topped with strips of real chicken with a thick honey glaze sauce, about 1/4 cup of black beans, 1/4 cup of corn, 3 slices of avocado and a sprinkling of queso fresco. There were also a few tortilla strips included. I had the ranch dressing on the side and didn't need to use much. The salad was very fresh and the perfect size to complement my palace margarita and my chip indulgence. For someone truly trying to eat healthy, this salad is an excellent choice.

The one thing that keeps this from being a 5 star review is the salsas are all pretty much the same. I'd love for them to make a salsa that is truly hot. The "hot" salsa here has no kick to it at all. The salsa bar would be so much better if there were more distinction between them.

I've had some hits and misses with service over the years, but overall good. One recent waitress was way off her game, but we all have bad days, right? And, clearly, she had something outside work distracting her. I hope she's better now. Tonight's guy accidentally rang up my husband's meal twice, but was very apologetic and quickly corrected it when we told him. 

Overall, a fun place for a quick bite or an affordable date night.
