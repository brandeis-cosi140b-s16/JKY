Doing some house sitting in Henderson and yelped up something near me.  Noticed the 4 stars and the "New Mexico" style cooking which I have never had.

The food was great.... I did a pork burrito.  Big junks of pork, home style... Makes me really wish I did steak though being the pork was that good....

Would have been 5 stars but the rice and beans were cold....  I should have said something but  everything looked so good I let it slide.

A few other points...

First off the staff was extremely nice.  Told the lady it was my first time there and to recommend and she was happy to accommodate.

Second dollar drafts!   All the time.

Third Daily Specials.!

Fourth frequent diner card!  Appreciation for repeat customers... nice

If you come across this post and consider eating here you will not be disappointed..
