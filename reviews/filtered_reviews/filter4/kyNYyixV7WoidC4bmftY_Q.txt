My husband and I have been here several times and even took the In-Laws once. (For Happy Hour $2.99 Margaritas that are delicious and not watered down.) Also, their tacos! Whether it is fish, pork, or steak - the tacos are so, so good. Plus, they are only $5 during Happy Hour, which is a steal. Normally we'd order the Obama burrito with red sauce to split. Definitely enough to share, but you'll probably want to growl at anyone who tries to take a bite from your plate. Unfortunately, Padre's closed doors in June and will be sorely missed.
