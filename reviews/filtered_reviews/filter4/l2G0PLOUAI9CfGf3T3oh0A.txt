Ok, this place is damn good. So damn good. The tacos were great, awesome combinations and ultimately this place is just very unexpected. the barbacoa and carnitas tacos are to die for...even the duck tongue was good(weird seeing little tongues in a tortilla but you get over it.) Because there were 4 of us, we decided to really sample the menu and try a lot of items...Lemon Tree Shrimp, Silencio, Barbacoa, Carnitas and Setas tacos and a few other things. The highlights for me besides the tacos were definitely the guacamole and tuna ceviche- I mean seriously, so friggin' good. Tasted the Salt Air Marg, eh whatever, not a big deal to me. 

Then, like everyone else, I agree...the bill came and I almost threw up all my food. $50 a person. We just got to Vegas. Shit. Not a good start! Next time, I will stick to one or two things and bring my own cocktail! SNAP!
