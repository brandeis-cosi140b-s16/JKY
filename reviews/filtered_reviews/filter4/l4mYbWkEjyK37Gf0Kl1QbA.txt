I was curious how Mexican food would be as good in Phoenix as it is in Tucson when I went here for a rehearsal dinner.  We were seated in a separate room in the back for our party but it seemed like a really fun place to hang out.  There was live music, plenty of different areas to sit in, and a lot of people enjoying themselves.  We had a buffet and I was very impressed with the menu options.  One of the dishes was green corn tamales, which I don't regularly see at Mexican restaurants (maybe they take too long to make?) and they were perfectly cooked.  Another surprise was a healthy green salad that really complimented our meal.  Sometimes when I eat Mexican food I don't feel like I am getting enough of a vegetable serving and this went perfectly.  The chips were also a big hit with everyone as they seemed to be fried and were a change from the traditional chip.  I was impressed by the flavorful and chunky salsa as well.
