I've been coming here for years but this is my first yelp review for this place. The Fajitas Restaurant is probably pretty well know around the valley and for good reason. They make some of the best fajitas in the valley. There are probably only a handful of smaller restaurants in the valley that put out quality fajitas like this place. 

Fajitas does entr√©es other then what they are known for but why stray from what they do best. The fajitas served here come family style with all the cheese, sour cream, guacamole and pico de Gayo on the side. The meats come out smoking hot and smelling fantastic. Choose from chicken, steak and shrimp for your meat, it doesn't matter what you pick because they all rock. The only thing better than the meat is the fresh tortillas. The tortillas are served warm and soft for easy fajitas building.

The tortilla chips served for free before the meal are a meal of there own. Salsa is complimentary but if you want a real treat get the queso dip for just a few extra bucks. This place serves beers, soda and just about any other alcoholic and non alcoholic beverage you can think of.

The staff is always friendly and I've never had bad service in all the years I've been coming here, even when it's busy. The restaurant and bathrooms are clean and the atmosphere seems geared for groups so bring the family. There is even a kids menu that would please the pickiest of eaters. Prices are fair and on par with comparable restaurants. 

I would definitely recommend this place and I will definitely be back for years to come. The only reason this isn't a five star is because the wait to get a table can be long at times, but that speaks the how good this place really is.
