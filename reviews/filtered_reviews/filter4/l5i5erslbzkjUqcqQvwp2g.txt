El Segundo Sol, or Second Sun in English, is located in the outside portion of the Fashion Show Mall.I happened to be in the neighborhood doing some clothes shopping when I decided I'd rather eat than shop.Took a spot at Bar Segundo, which is their bar that is in the outside patio of the restaurant and looked over a menu.

Typical Americanized-Mex menu with fajitas, enchiladas, taco platters, taquitos, etc.

I ordered an appetizer of Chicken Taquitos and a main course of Chicken Fajita platter.

The taquitos were quite awesome(i tend to use the words awesome and fuck alot in my reveiws fyi.)3 per order and served on top on lettuce , which I thought were just for presentation until the bartender informed me you can eat it like a wrap.Fuck...good. On the side its served with guacamole and some kind of sauce made from orange, which is alot spicier than I expected.Very sexy presentation.If it was a woman, I would make love to her.

The gripe I have with most Mexican joints and their fajitas, is that they tend to put a shitload of vegetables on the platter but very little steak/chicken/shrimp.Not the case here as there was a generous mix of chicken and veggies on the platter.Most joints tend to serve yellow rice and refried beans(or frijoles, as we say in Espanol.) with their fajita platters, but here they serve them with white rice and black beans.Black beans = crazy delicious, especially when you put them in a tortilla with chicken.

The margaritas here are no pussy margaritas.These things are strong and sneak up on you after you have a few.

This is definitely a repeat place for me.
