Solid place to grub. Service was great. They had Mexican pepsi on the menu but our server said it was not available at this location yet but should be soon. They did have Mexican coke so I had that. The real deal pepsi has me curious still so I will need to come back. 

Our visit started with free chips, guacamole, and salsa. I do not eat the green stuff so that went to the wife who liked it. I did think the salsa had a good taste. 

The chicken flautas here are very good yo! I am not much of a chicken fan but man these are good. Fried wontons were cheap and good. I don't remember what was in them, some type of meat but they were good. The main dish I wanted to try was the Beef Chow Fettuccine. It was a damn big portion and tasted great. The fusion tacos were okay but not my cup if regular tea. Priced here are reasonable. 

When the bill came I was surprised at how cheap it was for all the food we had. I also got a fortune cookie that had 2 cookies in it! Does this mean I am going to get extra lucky? I will be lucky enough to eat here again because I liked it.
