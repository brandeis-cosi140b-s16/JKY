I would give this place a 5 star except that I'm still a tough love reviewer and I only reserve 5 stars for impeccable ambiance and food to match.  The food was delicious and the wait staff was very attentive.

I had the torta de carne asada, and my dining buddy ordered the torta mexicana.  I know a thing or two about tortas because my family used to run a taco truck in the 1990s with only Mexican customers. I expected the torta de carne asada to be similar to what my friend ordered, the torta mexicana-- a flat strip of tender meat, cilantro, and tomato, mayonnaise, salsa, etc.  I would order what she ordered since my torta carne asada came undone too easily.  I don't want to be a messy eater if I'm about to go to another meeting afterwards. 

Enough with categories-- the tacos looked delicious, and free chips and salsa. the spicy salsa was pretty spicy, stick to the red mild sauce for the faint of heart.  This isn't child's play. 

I also ordered the horchata rice milk cinnamon beverage. Good stuff. 

To one side of me was a group of gringolandia college badgers, and to my right were Mexican customers who only spoke Spanish with the owners, in a very friendly demeanor as though they are regulars. The seating availability during lunch was spacious, but it might be during when school was not in session. 

Try this place before you decide to drop money at a chain Mexican burrito place.
