Okay, this place is in the strip. F**king get over that. Too many people ding a good restaurant for its strip location. It's a very good joint. Decent to good service and very good food. Love the hand made guacamole and the tamales. The rest of the menu has great merit. Elote is a good deal for $3. Good selection of tequila includes a double barrel reposado that Herraduro did just for the chef. $13 a shot or $200 for a bottle. If you're local you can leave your dedicated bottle at the bar for your convenience. Your key chain identified you as the bottle owner when you stop in. It is a very good tequila, aroma has definite tones of whisky and tobacco. Smooth, sherry like taste upfront with a pronounced but smooth tequila backbone
