Okay so this is another place that I would have never walked into but so glad I did. My sisters live close and took me once and now I have to stop by every time I am out that way. 

There always seems to be a little bit of a wait, usually around 20 minutes, but definitely worth it. Once you are seated they serve you pretty quickly. This place is small and it's always packed. Their food is the best! They bring you chips and different salsas to start. If you aren't afraid of spicy food ask them for the avocado salsa; its a green salsa that is usually made super hot but can be tamed when mixed with their other salsas. Their chips are always hot and taste fresh like their dishes. I usually get anything with Carne Asada because they make it better than anywhere else. 

I wish they had a full bar because a good mojito would make this place perfect :)!
