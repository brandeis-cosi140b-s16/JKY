I gave this location 4 stars because I have only ordered a few things there and they were excellent. The Tilapia Fish Tacos are a beautiful thing, I also had breakfast there last Saturday and had Chorizo eggs with black beans and rice. It was another excellent meal and very well priced! I love the east side location, it has great character! There is talk of redoing the menu, dont touch the fish tacos!!!
