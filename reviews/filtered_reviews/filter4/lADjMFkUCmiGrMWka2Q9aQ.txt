Finally, a great option for good food close to the Strip that's not a chain or fancy-pants casino restaurant!

I shared a Saturday afternoon lunch with my dad and grandmother and we all were impressed with the quality, flavor and portion sizes we received!  The wait staff was happy to bring my dad a bowl of their hottest sauce, as he didn't think the regular salsa that came with the chips and beans was hot enough.

My carnitas was tender and juicy, served with guacamole and lime alongside of some of the best spanish rice I've had.  My dad proclaimed the chorizo in his huevos con chorizo to be very flavorful - he said it wasn't spicy at all, but he can't be believed in that.  The tortillas that accompanied our entrees were obviously very fresh and hand-made.

The service was friendly, but could have been a tad more attentive.  Lunch for three with coffee and tea, plus a dessert to-go was $41.  All in all, no complaints - and I'll definately be bringing friends and family back to Casa Don Juan.
