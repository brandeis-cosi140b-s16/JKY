Stopped in for lunch and had a beef with red chili sauce burrito, which was great and flavorful. You need a knife and fork to tackle these burritos, packed full of goodness and fresh ingredients! 

I'll be back again to try some more items, staff was friendly and accommodating, parking and dining spaces are a bit slim, but grab your order to go, its all good!
