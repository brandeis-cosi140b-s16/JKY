The rave reviews are a slight exaggeration - I wouldn't call it the best mexican in town, but it is good with large portions and cheap prices. Definitely better than what you'd typically expect from a gas station restaurant. 

I just got the carne asada nachos for $7.50 which was pretty solid and overflowing with cooked to order steak. I'm a fan of heat, so I liked that the pico had quite a bit of chopped jalapenos but if youre not, be sure to ask for non spicy pico (if he makes it, I didn't ask). It is called a Mexican grill so seems like his meats are all cooked on the flat top vs like chicken tinga. 

I would probably make this my new go to for neighborhood mexican, but he closes early at 6pm on Saturdays and 4pm all other days. I have a thing for late night mexican runs, so its just not meant to be.
