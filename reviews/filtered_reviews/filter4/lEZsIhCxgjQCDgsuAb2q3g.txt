The trendy Mexican/taco scene is heating up in phoenix. and at 3-5 per small taco wouldn't you want to be in the game too?

Step in to a overly retro 60's themed inside, from the lamps to the wallpaper you would think you are in Austin powers. The patio is nice despite the terrible metal chairs. 

You will be greeted by the obligatory chips and salsa, but it is nice that they don't charge extra for this staple. 

The menu has salads tacos burritos and tortas. For vegetarians its pretty much salads, a taco or a burrito. For the best value go for the burrito it is full of great items like mushrooms and roasted veggies all for $8 they will even make it a heart friendly chimichanga for no extra charge. 

I tried a trio of tacos that included a side for a grand total of $14. They were good but more of an appetizer than a meal. Luckily there were more chips to gorge on.
