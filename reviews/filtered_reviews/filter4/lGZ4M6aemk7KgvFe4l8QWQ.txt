I know cabin has been getting mixed reviews lately... but I'm still a fan! I've been going for a couple years. It used to be so popular that the wait was ridiculous. Glad they expanded and have more seating now.

Everything I've had here has been great! Just thinking about the fish tacos while writing this review make me want to go eat.
