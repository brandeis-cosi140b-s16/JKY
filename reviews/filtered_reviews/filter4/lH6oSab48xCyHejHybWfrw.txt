Love this place. Inexpensive, hearty and generous meal. I had fish burrito and fish tacos at different occasions. I think this is my favorite place to enjoy good Mexican food for less. It's well located and in a very nice hood.

If I am in Charlotte and close this hood, I definitely go here and eat. The staff is friendly. They outside seating which is great in a good weather. This place is close to a train station that makes it easy connection to the downtown area. 

I highly recommend this place.
