My boyfriend and I go here at least once or twice a month, and while its not top notch mexican food, its pretty darn good. The chips and salsa are great-especially the "hot" salsa that they only bring you on request. I even bought hot and regular salsa to bring to a mexican dinner party I was attending once. 
I always get the same thing because a. its really good, and b. nothing else can tempt me away from it. Its the shrimp stuffed poblano chilies. It isnt swimming in grease or tons of cheese, the peppers and shrimp have always tasted amazing, AND its served with calabacitas, which I love! The chunks of zuccini with corn, tomatoes, onions just make me smile! My bf really likes their chimichangas and a chicken fundido burrito too. 
Another added bonus is the coupon that comes in the mail (the clipper maybe?) that gives you buy one entree get one free. I love it! They also have their fajitas at a discounted price on Thursdays right now!
