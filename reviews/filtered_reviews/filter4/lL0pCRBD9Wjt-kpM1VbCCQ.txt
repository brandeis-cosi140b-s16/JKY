I really enjoy the atmosphere here. I attend their happy hour every other week. Now I just go on Tuesdays since it's 2 dollar taco night. If you like authentic Mexican food in a family owned restaurant this is the place to go. I never sit in the dinning area, always at the bar. Service is fast and the bar tenders are great. Happy hour is from 4 to 7 pm with 2$ coronas and 4$ well drinks, and they will even give you the remote for the TVs.
