Came here yesterday for an Easter Day Mexican brunch. Great experience overall. The first thing I noticed here was the awesome patio. We didn't sit outside on this visit but it would definitely be a patio I would return to for happy hour to enjoy the nice fountain and a fire pit in the fall and winter.

Rodrigo was our waiter and he was great. Very accommodating and thoroughly explained the menu. They had a Sunday brunch menu (from 10am to 4pm) in addition to the regular menu. After looking over both menus I was having a hard time deciding because of so many great sounding options. I really wanted to try the Chilaquiles with huevos ranchero but ultimately decided on the papas with chipolte crema and chorizo. I also ordered a mimosa ($3 on Sunday brunch special). My fiance ordered a grilled chicken burrito smothered with red sauce and a vampiro taco which consisted of carne asada and chipolte sauce. I absolutely loved my papas (see picture)!! They were cooked perfectly with bacon and chorizo and the chipolte crema is delicious. It is enough food to feed about 4 people so be aware of that. I have leftovers for days which I don't mind. My fiance's chicken burrito was also delicious. The red sauce was very tomato based and tasted great, clearly house made. 

There are many other menu items I would love to try here and I will definitely be returning to try more. They do have a taco with the ghost chili which I will give a try in the future. I think I will definitely be returning on a Sunday afternoon again because there are so many things on the brunch menu that I need to sample including shrimp and crab cakes benedict. The service was great and overall we had a great experience. I will be going back!!
