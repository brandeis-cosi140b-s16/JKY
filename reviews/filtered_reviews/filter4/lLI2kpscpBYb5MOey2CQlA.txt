Came for a friend's birthday. Had a cabana rented and was seated almost immediately. Servers were very attentive to the group (about 10 people) and made sure everything was going well.

The minimum bill (for all items ordered) for the cabana was $300 split between all people, which is easy to reach. That's not as bad as it sounds... the food and drinks are good enough to order enough to reach the limit.

Atmosphere is okay. The music isn't always going to match what you enjoy, but it's a good mix. But if you're paying more attention to the music than your company, something's wrong. Definitely will bs coming back.
