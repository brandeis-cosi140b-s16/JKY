The line for this place is ridiculous & it is hard to find seating.

Price for tacos isn't bad but it adds up very quickly.

The food is pretty good though... They usually give you 2 corn tortillas per taco but I think it tastes better with just 1.

Not having 2 tortillas makes it hard not to rip the tortilla.

I would rather go to Robertos because of the long wait
