Good, consistent, friendly service, these are the top three adjectives that I can think of to describe Cafe Rio.  While it is a chain, I prefer it to Chipotle, as I know it happens to be slightly healthier, and the staff there are fun to talk to as you go through the line.  I'm a fan of the tostada and salads, and I like that they make their tortillas fresh right there in the store, and that you can watch them make everything.  I'm also slightly biased in that it's affordable and near the UNLV campus, which as a student makes it very convenient for me.
