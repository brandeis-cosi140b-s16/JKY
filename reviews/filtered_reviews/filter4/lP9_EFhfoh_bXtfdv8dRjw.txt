- My service was outstanding!
- Food was really good (tried both the red chili and green chili; both good ... but the green chili was awesome!)
- Margaritas were great.
- Atmosphere was more of a local dive.

If you are looking for a classy Mexican dinner, this is not the place.  However, if you are looking for good Mexican food, with good margaritas in a local joint, this is the place for you.

When I arrived (by myself as I was in Phoenix on business), I was promptly seated.  I was quickly greeted by a gentleman with chips, salsa, and water.  Then, quickly by my waitress who was super nice and took great care of me the whole evening.  I explained to her that I had never been there before and ask for her recommendations.  She shared her favorites but said before I make my decision, I should try both the red chili and the green chile.  She scurried off to the kitchen and came back with two small bowls so I could try each.  The red chili was really good; but I had to agree with her that the green sauce was killer!

I ended up having a burro with green chili and whole beans with a side of  refried beans and a margarita.  Everything was fantastic.   Great food,  great margaritas, great service.

I think they would be a good candidate for Triple D.  I'll be back!
