Finally, good Mexican food in Mesa! I just moved to Mesa from Glendale, and let me tell you, the West side wins the Mexican food wars. Anyway, I had a combo plate with a green chile "burrito" (it was more like an enchilada with a flour tortilla instead of corn, which was a little disappointing) and a cheese enchilada. The rice was nothing special but everything else, including the beans, was excellent. The green chile was pretty spicy and sooo good. Enchilada and sauce were perfect. Beans were great. My companion had a combo plate with a green chile chimi, chalupa and taco. He said everything was delicious. Chips and salsa were great. Prices were about average for a sit down Mexican place. Oh, and they never let us run out of water, something that is very important to my expectations. I will definitely be back.
