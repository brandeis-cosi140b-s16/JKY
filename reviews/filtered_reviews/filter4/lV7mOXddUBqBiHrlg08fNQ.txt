Probably the best fajitas I've ever had.  The service is very friendly and  great.  It has a typical cantina feel.  It was very clean in there. The chips are served with two kinds of salsa.  I only had the red, which was great and perfectly spiced.  They also served grilled onions and peppers to go with them, which is a nice touch.   I had the combination steak and chicken fajitas.  They were great and flavorful.  They brought them out sizzling on a cart.  And then they pour something on them and light them on fire. It is a neat presentation.  They serve them with soup (which I opted not to have, because I felt like it would be too much food), your choice of refried or black beans, rice, guacamole, and pico de gallo, as well as choice of corn or flour tortillas (I got the corn).  And the tortillas are made there at the restaurant.  It was awesome.  My only complaints are that the rice and beans were lukewarm.  It was alright though, because I put them into the fajitas anyway.  They brought the tortillas a couple of minutes after my food, which they probably were fresh from the oven, which was nice, but they probably should wait and bring everything at once.  The worst thing is that it is in the same parking lot as a crappy In-N-Out Burger.  I almost got into a wreck twice, with people trying to get to In-N-Out.  But I look forward to going back there again soon.  It's the closest thing to Tex-Mex, as I can find out here in Vegas.
