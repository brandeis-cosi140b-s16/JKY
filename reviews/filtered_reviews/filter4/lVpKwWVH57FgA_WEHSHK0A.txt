I thoroughly enjoyed this... If you're looking for a chipotle type of place, skip chipotle and come here. Either way, the salsa is mild, even the hot sauce is mild. Mild but it has a lot of flavor. For a good and okay place, come here. Try the steak burrito & mint lime drink!!!! My 5 year got a free cheese "Nino quesadilla". This is on my side of town and I thought it was okay. Nice atmosphere.... For a fast food type of place!!
