So you don't want to go to Old Town on a Friday night? Then Sandbar is for you. Dip you toes in the sand and dance the night away to the beats of that song you don't remember the words to, but feel compelled to attempt to sing. I don't think there is a better atmosphere in North Phoenix on a Friday or Saturday night, but if you cannot take part in the late night fun stop in for their extended happy hour from 3-7 every day and get some chips and homemade guacamole and a chamboard margarita to convince you to stay after sundown.
