This is literally a hidden gem on 16th Street and Bethany Home. There is no signage outside so you just have to find it. The place is TINY, essentially a bar and a few tables and a function room behind the usually closed door by the entrance. As with their sister restaurant Rokerij, the smell of burning wood permeates the place. They serve beer and cocktails and have a good selection of wine. The food here is great. If you don't mind waiting this is a great place for brunch. The green chile meatloaf is probably my favorite-it is served over a tortilla with beans and two eggs. OH IT IS SOOOOO GOOD!!!! I also had green chile stew which was fantastic as well. One of my favorite places to hit in Phoenix.
