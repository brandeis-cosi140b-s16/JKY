Gonna keep it short(ish) and simple today.  Arrived at 6PM on a Sunday, and to say that parking is extremely limited is an understatement.  The restaurant itself is small, which explains why there weren't too many parking spots.  It was a 45 minute wait for a table for two so we ordered takeout instead.  A little crammed and loud with people talking over one another, but it was actually pretty cozy.  The staff were really nice, pleasant, and efficient even with the crowd and gave us little lids for the salsa, along with our horchata, after we placed our order.

Fast forward through standing around awkwardly in what felt like everyone's way for 20 minutes in the restaurant, we had our burros in hand - an Al Pastor burro and La Santisima burro (chicken).  The burros are pretty sizable and scrumptious.  The salsa bar is probably what sets this place apart from the rest.  It's fun and most of them have a little kick to it, so have a glass of water nearby.  I loved their horchata, it's a little sweeter than other horchatas, has more cinnamon, and the fruits (strawberries) are a great touch.  Definitely will be back, probably for takeout.
