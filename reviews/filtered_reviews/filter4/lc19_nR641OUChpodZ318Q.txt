This is another great place on what is becoming a great intersection for drinks - 16th St and Bethany Home.  I love it.

I've never been here for food, but I'm looking forward to it.  I like that you kind of eat and drink at the bar, and the bathroom is hidden somewhere in the kitchen.  And I also like that there isn't a sign outside and you just have to know where the place is.

Drinks are of good price considering the warm, upscale(ish) atmosphere of the place.  They also have a happy hour, during which you get a free snack-sized piece of food alongside your discounted drinks.  At last check they did a reverse happy hour also, which I'm a sucker for.

Why the minus-1 star?  I took a very large group of people on a bar crawl through my favorite intersection, and Dick's Hideaway was one of the stops.  We literally filled the place.  I accidentally broke a Stella glass (the true form of accident, not the drunk kind), and the bartender was pretty rude about it.  But that won't stop me from going back.
