Like the fact it is open 24 hours.  My wife and went there over Labor Day weekend and had the shrimp app and a steak burrito. Everything was perfect, had enough burrito to share and take back to hotel.  Had no problem using the groupon.  Our server gave us some utensils to take back also.  Definitely recommend
