First time eating in. Pretty good. They only have one Salad (The Unica) that is on the healthier side of life; however, this salad is INCREDIBLE. I got it with the grilled halibut. Perfect portion. If your not counting calories than this place definitely gets 5 stars. They have a TON of gluten free options too. 

They kicked us off the patio for moving one of the tables out of the sun which they said "violate the wheelchair policy." Understandable and kinda funny. Plus, who rolls in a wheelchair when its 107 degree outside? 

The new-school electric menu is rather cool. 

Get sum.
