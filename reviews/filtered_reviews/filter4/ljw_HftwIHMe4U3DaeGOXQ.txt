Loved the food. We ordered off of the street taco menu. We had the pastor, conchinita pibil, chicken with pinon crema and pork Verde with cactus. Every taco was delicious. We  had a couple of skinny Margaritas, just tequilla, lime juice and agave . They were tasty. The food is upscale and so are the prices. Small two or three bite street tacos are $3 and up. Is it worth it? I would say yes. There are plenty of inexpensive taco shops if you want a huge $4 carne asada burrito and that has it's place. If you want an elevated Mexican food experience try this.
