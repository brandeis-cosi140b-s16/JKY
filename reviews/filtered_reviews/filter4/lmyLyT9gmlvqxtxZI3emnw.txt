Great authentic Mexican food! We had a very nice dinner(chicken and steak fajitas) and the servers were attentive without being bothersome. The nicest part was the complimentary ride back to our hotel in the restaurant's Honda Scion. That saved us a $25 cab fare! This is a must for people looking to eat good Mexican and get away from all the over-priced casino/hotel restaurants!
