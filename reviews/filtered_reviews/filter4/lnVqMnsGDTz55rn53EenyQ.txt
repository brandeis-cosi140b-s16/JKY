Met here with the same group of friends. 
I had a shrimp taco this time (really good)
and we shared a queso fundido with chorizo, which was kind of runny.
I also had a tamal oaxaque√±o and it will not be my favorite item on the menu.

The salsas are great, and I like how they are in ketchup like containers.

This time we sat outside, the service was good and weather was gorgeous.
