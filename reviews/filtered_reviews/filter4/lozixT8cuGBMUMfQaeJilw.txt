been to phat phranks twice. i eat a alot of food so ive tried all the tacos and a carne asada tostada. everything was good. the fish tacos are definitely my favorite though. my least favorite is the slow cooked pork taco. the meat was too dry for me. food is definitely good but a overpriced a taco is $3 and a fish taco is $5 like i said i eat alot so i usually order about 5 tacos and bill ends up being $20.
