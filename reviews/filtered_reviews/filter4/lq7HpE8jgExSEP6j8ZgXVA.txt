I have had both good and bad experiences at this restaurant.  The food is above average, but poor service negates even the best quality food.  

Fortunately, Kevin was my bartender on what would have been my last day there.  He "gets it" when it comes to serving., better than anyone in Silverton.  

Even if it's busy, just greet me and say you will get to me soon.  I have sat for over 10 minutes without any greeting, with the bartender serving peuple right next to me.  And check to see if everything is all right after you get your food and start eating.  There are more points, but most of all be consistent.  I know I can bring a date or buddies when Kevin is on, and have a pleasant experience every time.  

I usually go to Mi Casa a couple of days mid week, and he's at the Shady Grove lounge on Fridays.
