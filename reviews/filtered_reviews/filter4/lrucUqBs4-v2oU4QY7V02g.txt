Very tasty tacos. Tostadas and sopes are better. Their chorizo is great.
Expect very slow service. My wife and I usually stop in, order to go, go to the store and grab something to drink or whatever the other person wants for dinner, then we head back. Usually, the food still isn't ready. Prices are good. The inside is very unassuming. The selection of sodas is minimal at times.
The only thing bad I can say about the place is that you really have to order everything you want at once. No ordering one or two tacos and then one or two more, they're just not quick enough.
