Located on the 2nd level where the showrooms, retail shops and Titanic and Bodies attractions are at....this place is not that bad. 

COMPLIMENTARY chips and salsa. Hells yeah!!!! Can't go to a Mexican restaurant and not get FREE chips and salsa!!! The green salsa taste better than the red on in my opinion. 

My friend and I got 2 combos and they were only $20.00 each. Pretty decent price especially since it's located ON THE STRIP. 
His combo included a chile releano and two enchiladas I think.
My combo included a chicken tamale, pork taco, and beef enchilada. (see pic.)
Both combos include rice and beans. You can opt for all rice or all beans if you want.

Honestly...T & T is located on the strip. Don't complain about prices. It's expected to cost higher than normal. The food was delicious, ambiance was chill and the service was good. What more can you ask for in this tourist city?? If you're so concerned about the cost...then I suggest just going to the food court. But if you want to have lunch/dinner at a nice, decent priced, sit-down restaurant...then this place is recommended.
