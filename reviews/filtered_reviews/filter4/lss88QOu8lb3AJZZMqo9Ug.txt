So came here for the first time and can say I was not disappointed. We ordered fish ceviche tostada, agua chile and a shrimp and octopus coctel. I really enjoyed the agua chile. We ordered it at level 5 to make sure it wasn't going to be too hot. It was surprisingly spicier than I expected but had a great taste. The fish ceviche was ok. The coctel was also tasty. Overall I would definitely go again to try many things on the menu. Oh also the preparadas are very good!
