Whatever you do do not eat breakfast here on the weekends.  I have a hard enough time finding a seat at the bar without you taking up valuable space.  This place has a great meatloaf and eggs, and their take on eggs Benedict is awesome - the pork is like Canadian bacon on steroids.  Not literally on steroids, I am sure it is free range pig - but really thick, lean slices of good pork.  Add a bloody Mary, and you truly have the breakfast of champions.  Or at least breakfast for someone with a mild hangover that wants to get the day going.  Happy hour is also great, I think they still run the $5 wine specials and a free appetizer is sometimes served at the bar top.  Overall one of my favorite bars in the area.
