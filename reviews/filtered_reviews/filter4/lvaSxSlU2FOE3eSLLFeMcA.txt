If you're going for happy hour or to be served by waitstaff this is not the place for you.  If you want great food for a phenomenal price you've come to the right place. $24 for a family of 4 - you can't even go to Taco Bell for that price. 

The atmosphere is a step below informal.  The inside walls are wrapped with industrial looking steel and the building is old.  My husband & son were not happy when we pulled into the parking lot & walking through the door - it is a bit bare bones.  I was thrilled because after reading all of the great reviews I KNEW the food had to be good!  

The seating area is small but does cater to indoor and outdoor patrons.    

There is not a huge selection of refreshments but they serve soda in bottles and the Coca Cola products have the extra sugar cane made for Mexico.  Sweet  & yummy.

The group I was in was large - we ordered street tacos, quesadillas, taquitos, rice, beans.  The carne asada and fish tacos were awesome.  Loved the flour tortillas used in the quesodillas - they were nice & thin.  They even made a white boy tortilla for my husband and added a little grease then toasted the corn tortilla for him to try (he's not a fan of corn tortillas because they are dry).  My friend had the pork taco and her hubs tried the tripe.  Even my son who was appalled walking in the door left with a full tummy filled with fish tacos, quesodillas, & going back up to order 2 taquitos, AND a complete apology that you can't judge a book by it's cover.   

Someone at another table ordered a mexican pizza and we are so ordering that next time!!!
