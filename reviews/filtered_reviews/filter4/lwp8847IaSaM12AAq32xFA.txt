Cantina 1511 is great! Definitely check it out. The food is a bit higher priced that your average Mexican eatery but the quality of the food is higher as well... and Cantina is more Tex-Mex actually. The guacamole is fresh and fashioned up table side when you order. I'm a big fan of this as it makes the guacamole smoother and your server asks you your heat preference - great for spice lovers like myself!

I had a crab meat quesadilla and side salad on one on my latest ventures and both were phenominal. Highly recommended. The margaritas are quite tasty as well, never too sour, and you have a vast menu to choose from, all in different styles and flavors. I tend to make friends with margaritas quite easily so eventually, I'm sure I will befriend them all. Multiple times. 

This joint gets busy busy, especially at night, so reservations are recommended here.
