At last they are our neighborhood! We got the kimchee fried rice with combo meat. They do an egg on top.  It was excellent.  We also got the chow fettuccine with chicken. I like it a little spicy. They have amazing sauc es. The sweet - spicy Korean is my favorite. Although we picked up the order to go it was just as good as if we dined in. That says a lot in itself! Great food and as always friendly service.
