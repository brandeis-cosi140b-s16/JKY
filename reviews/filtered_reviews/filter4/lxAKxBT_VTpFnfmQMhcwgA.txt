One of my favorite places for tasty New Mexican Food in the Valley. Redecorated since I was here last time. What an improvement. Outside and inside are nicely done up with a comfortable rustic vibe that makes you feel right at home. You can smell the aroma of the Pecan Wood as you get out of your car. Gets me excited right away. Nice!

Been here maybe a couple dozen times or more. Sometimes on business and the food is always delicious. Great place to take friends visiting or clients from out of town. 

Some of the items we enjoy are the FREE Fire Roasted Salsa with Tri-Colored Tortilla Chips, the Fresh Guacamole, Green Chile Lobster Dip, the Adobe Salad, the Carne Adovada, the Taos Combo, the Santa Cafe, Chorizo Stuffed Chicken, Spooning Rellenos, Last Night's Meat Loaf, and a few of my all time favorites when I am not paying, the Land of Enchantment, the Oscar Medallion and the Tucamcari. Too many to list them all.

What makes the difference here is the way they fire roast their tomatoes, peppers, and onions for the salsa as well as the meats they grill using that delicious Pecan Wood. Oh Yeah!

Can get pretty busy during peak hours and the service sometimes is a little spotty. Ask for a table next to the windows or up front. The back section requires a flash light to read the menu and see the food. Good thing I have one on my Smart Phone. Simply Delicious!
