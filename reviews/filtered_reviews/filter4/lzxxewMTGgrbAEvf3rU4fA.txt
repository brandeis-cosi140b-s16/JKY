I'm originally from Cali and verrrry picky about my Mexican food. So when I came to visit my sister she over 2 yrs ago we came to Pepes. And I was like YES!!! My asada burritos ALWAYS HAVE SOOOO MUCH MEAT IN THEM!!! The horchata is pretty good always. Last week my boyfriend order asada tacos and loved them.
