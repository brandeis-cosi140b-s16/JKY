Had a trip to Vegas so I decided to try Guy Fieri's reco on Diners-Drive in-Dives. Kinda tough finding the place being it's situated in the back of a strip mall right across from UNLV. 
Decor - college arena, surfboards, graffiti on walls, wooden tables and chairs. I can see this place crazy during UNLV events.
Had the Pastor tacos per recommended by the cashier. They were tasty but pricey compared to tacos you can buy in ELA. 
All in all, I'd go again.
