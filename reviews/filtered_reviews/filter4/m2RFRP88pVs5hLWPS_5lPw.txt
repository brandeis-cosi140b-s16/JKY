After much searching for this place the bf and I finally went! A tiny little hole in the wall tucked inside of a very bland string of other businesses. Barely noticeable from the street, I wonder if I would ever have run into this place if on my own!

Walking in, the lime green walls and "older" furniture left me wondering what kind of boyfriend I had and whether I should turn and run. Thank goodness I didn't! We were seated immediately and given drinks and fresh guac and salsa. The chips tasted freshly fried and delish! 

I was weary about the fusion type. Can these two foods REALLY go together? Are my beans going to run into my kimchi and vice versa? I left my worrying aside as I ordered the fusion burrito. I chose chicken to be safe. The bf had bulgogi tacos. Our food arrived pretty quickly. My eyes grew huge when I saw my burrito! WTF?!?! The thing was gigantic!!! When I opened it up and started to eat I paused after the first bite. HOW DAMN DELICIOUS! The thing was too big to finish and I regretted having a big lunch before stopping here for dinner! haha! The marinated meat was better than I had at more expensive restaurants with nicer decor, etc. The tacos were great too. I just had to steal a bite. The meat was soft and cooked just right. Not overcooked or rubbery as we've had in other fast food places. The people working were so sweet and checked on us often. 

Towards the end of our meal when I thought I could not fit in another bite, our server came up to us with half a sliced orange and two fortune cookies. It was a very sweet gesture. Free dessert AND a palate cleanser! ha! The perfect touch to a great dinner!
