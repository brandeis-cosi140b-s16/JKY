Really flavorful.  Fun experience to really personalize my food, which is nice because i'm picky.  The staff was eager to let me sample.  I didn't think i would ever be interested in having a cornbread filling, but i'll have to do that next because it was amazing!  I ordered two enchiladas: one pork and one chicken, with the red sauce.  I think next time i'll have get the fried egg, because the sauce and pork were so dark a flavor that it needed it to smooth it out for my tastes.  (I fried my own egg to go with my left overs, yum)  
I think for a local small start-up business to expect them to have the multitude of ingredient available all the time, is a lot to expect.    They had everything there for us to try!  The menu was a little confusing only in that i didn't know why they listed salad dressings like they might apply to an enchilada, and it would have been nice if there were little signs labeling what all the ingredients were on the glass.  It also would have been helpful to have paper menus to grab and step aside to read over.  I felt uncomfortable standing next to a table of customers eating to read the menu so that others could go ahead of me. 
I don't have the best hearing, but did okay talking through the glass and wide counter.
