The food is some of my favorite in Arizona. It's my go-to place, because most everything is delicious (the one thing I'm disappointed with is the guacamole, which is really bland...I can make it better myself, and that's definitely not the case of anything else on the menu) and it's really reasonably priced. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because sometimes the service is really slow, to the point that my food has been cold when I have picked it up after calling in an order. I get that they are busy, and I wouldn't mind waiting, but when my food is sitting there ready and I'm standing there wanting to pay but not being helped, it can be frustrating.
