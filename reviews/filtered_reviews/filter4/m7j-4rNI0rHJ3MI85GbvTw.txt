I tried 5 different types of tacos:
Beef head, tripe, spicy pork, tongue, chorizo

Beef head had a very Offal taste to it.  Enjoyed the tripe, was surprisingly tender and didn't have that offal taste.  Spicy pork, not really spicy, chorizo was good, not as oily as some other chorizos that i had tried..  For condiments, they had lime, radish, and salsa.

I would eat here again.  Tacos are good.
