This is a nice casual mexican fast food/dine in restaurant.  When you first walk in theres a counter to place your order, your then given an order number and seat yourself. We came here on a thursday night and to my surprise they were pretty busy, with a live band outside( descent music) the other diners seemed to be having a good time  which is an automatic bonus, people by nature thrive on other people's vibes. One of my favorite things here is they have a self serve chip and  salsa bar that was well maintained visually and for the most part seems cleanly, the salsa is really good and taste very fresh they also have toppings like onions, pico, lemons, cilantro and  cucumbers all fresh! Which I applaud.. we munched on the unlimited chips and salsa for awhile the wait was a little longer then I would have expected,  but I was in no hurry and was just enjoying the company of my family. We eventually got our food I split a combo meal with my partner  that came with a taco, tostada, tamale, and rice and beans. And ordered a kids hamburger with fries for the kids. This place has very large portions so its cost effective for the family 16.98 $ fed my family of four and we were pleasantly stuffed. And im a gal that can put it down im by no means a rabbit. So when I say large portions I do mean it. The only thing I could suggest for the restaurant is the rice is very disappointing to me and bland, im a pretty hard critic when it comes to spanish rice, because I make a killer Spanish rice I grew up on. The other thing I wasnt to pleased with , I did not like the fact that a few of the staff were chasing eachother around the restaurant and one almost ran my 6 year old daughter over.  There is a time and place for rough play and on the clock should not be one of those times. Overall opinion is pretty tasty and affordable. . I will most definitely come back for the food .
