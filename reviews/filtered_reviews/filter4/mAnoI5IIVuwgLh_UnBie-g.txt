Had lunch here today, taco and salad combo.   Fresh and full of flavor.  ordered special tuna taco, which was overdone, but management was responsive and courteous.  Excellent wait staff.  Table side Guacamole was ample serving, especially compared to Cantina 1511.   Don Pedro's still does it better, adding radish or jicama for crunch, cilantro, and lemon juice. Margarita was well blended and tequila options were impressive.   Wait staff was impressive!   How Chuys stays in business so close to this place is impossible to understand,
