Sandbar is a great place to hangout without having to deal with the hassle of "going out". I've been here for Taco Tuesdays three times, a Saturday night with a friend, and on a date. I've been satisfied every time. The food is good. All my servers have been friendly. Especially the woman who picks up the plates, if she recognizes you she gives you a warm hug and makes quick small talk in english and spanish. 

I was surprised to hear a good DJ. I moved here in September of 2014 from Miami and I've been disappointed at the quality of DJs. However on Tuesday nights the DJ mixes 90s hits with modern house beats. Heard some really good remixes. Saturdays is top 40s with the occasional trap remix. I was surprised they even threw in a merengue for the latin crowd. Given that there's a good sized dance floor I wished the DJ would have focused more on keeping that vibe going more. I feel he played more to the non-dancers which makes sense because they make the bar money. Could be a great dance spot if music was a little better.

Crowd is ok, not upscale, chill mixed crowd. Expect a few cat calls on a weekend from men as you walk through the crowd. Can be annoying but tolerable. 

The overall vibe is pretty laid back, ladies you can dress down or rock heals on a weekend and not feel over dressed. Keep in mind some of the outdoor seating in on sand when picking the right shoes.

I don't drink so I can't comment on that, but they do make a yummy virgin pina colada and shirley temple, yes I actually ordered those. You should have seen their faces. 

Enjoy!
