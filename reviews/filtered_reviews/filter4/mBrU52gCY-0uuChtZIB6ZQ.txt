La Salsa Cantina is buried in the back of the Planet Hollywood's Miracle Mile Shops, but they have great breakfast specials before noon--$3.99 for 2 eggs, potatoes, choice of meat and 2 tortillas and $0.99 bloody marys. The food is simple, but hearty, and the bloody mary is fine (it is only 8 ounces, but for this prices you can get a few).

We were able to get a seat in the open area at the front of the restaurant, which offers good views of the people passing by, the sport's bar across the walkway, and the small fountain that is choreographed to music. The atmosphere is loud...since you are right by the walkway, but it is very good people watching.

Our service was fine--very quick for as busy as they were and, when asked about a spicy bloody, he brought us extra hot sauce.

I wish I would have discovered this place earlier in my visit to Las Vegas...a great place to start the day and save some cash.
