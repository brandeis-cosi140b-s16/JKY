There are two big reasons why I love Lindo's: the view of the Las Vegas Strip and the house made guacamole!

Every time we come here we are welcomed by friendly staff. You can look in to the kitchen where they're busy making the homemade tortillas, and your mouth is watering even before you've been seated. 

The place is usually pretty busy, and when we've been visiting it's always very loud. I like it, it makes for a great atmosphere. 

As I mentioned, the house made guacamole is my favorite. They make it fresh right by the table, and you get to pick how spicy you want it. Usually they also give you a complimentary tomato soup in addition to the fresh chips and salsa, so by the time you're ready for the entrees you're already pretty full. 

The Margaritas are also very good, so Lindo's is a good place for a date night with perfect views accompanied by delicious Mexican food and a mariachi band.
