Seriously good Mexican food at a hole in the wall place. $.99 margaritas on Tuesdays and Saturdays. They're good ones too, nothing dinky.
Only thing I've had that I didn't like was the tortilla soup- it was oily and bland the day I had it. The salsa, on the other hand, is awesome. It tastes different every time we go here, which tells me someone is making it by hand. My personal favorite is the deep-fried burrito. It is always stuffed full and piping hot. Hubby likes the fish tacos- nice fresh fish deep-fried to perfection.
The last few times we've been here we've had some issues, but management has always taken care of things. It must not outweigh the good because we keep coming back!
