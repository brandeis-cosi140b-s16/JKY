Good food!  I learned of Los Taquitos from Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives, and had to check it out.  The place is tiny, but it was packed the entire time my friend and I munched down on their tasty bites!  I ordered the Bombarro (?) Burro, as it was made on the show, and its HOT! But so good!  I ordered my husband street tacos to go, and he inhaled them.  Best advise would be to call in your order for pick up, as not much seating available because of the seemingly non-stop flow of customers.
