i have been to Los Taquitos a few times for lunch and once for dinner. Love the street tacos and the green chili pork burrito. The margaritas are $3 at happy hour and are surprisingly good. Certainly not the sweet mixer kind! We did have to wipe down our own table at lunch. But overall good food at a good price
