I was a little apprehensive about trying this place because of the mixed reviews and the prices... 

We deliberated for a little while, but decided to try with the knowledge that 1) This is not really a fusion place and 2) We probably weren't going to be full.

The place is decorated really cute and fun and the service is very friendly and attentive. I ordered the wild mushroom taco, the 20-vegetable fried rice, and the Open Sesame cold noodles. My companions ordered the lotus chips, Lengua taco, some kind of taco with oyster, and Pozole Rojo.

That wild mushroom taco was so delicious!!!! I have never had anything like it. Priced at $5.50, it is rather expensive for a teeny tiny taco but I LOVED it and that makes it totally worth it. I thought that the noodles and fried rice were also pricey, but really good and surprisingly filling. Try counting 20 vegetables in the fried rice... try it! J really enjoyed the pozole. I'm sure he wished it came in a larger portion too. The lotus chips were thin and crispy, not greasy at all.

So in conclusion, it's no lie that this place is super expensive. However, I still think it is worth the splurge because in the end, if the food and dining experience can exceed my expectations, then I am glad that I tried it. Trust me, I have paid close to the same dollar amount for sub-par food and service.
