I adore this Mexican food place. 
The food is enjoyable, and always consistent. 
The Pollo Fondito is my favorite. Just the right amount of spice and LOTS AND LOTS of cheese. 
The wait staff is kind, and friendly. 

The drinks are amazing. I love all of their margaritas. (those that I have tried anyways LOL) 

But my favorite part about this location is the building. Everything is so colorful and campy, and just beautiful. My husband thinks it's tacky, but I just adore it. 

I had a friend who was married here years ago, and it's just a beautiful location.
