Amazing brunch!!!! They have different flavored mimosa from cucumber lemon, to pomegranate, watermelon, peach...... They have small plates tapas style that is made to order, everything I ordered was pretty good my favorite one is the tamales, oyster Rockefeller, shrimp with grits. Definitely will be back again
