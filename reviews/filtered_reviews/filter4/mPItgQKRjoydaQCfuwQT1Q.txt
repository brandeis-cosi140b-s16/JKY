Our experience began with the manager turning our business down being unable to accommodate a party of 9.  There were empty tables and booths and yet he was telling us there was 1 hour wait. He was willing to let us go instead of trying come up with a solution. I offered splitting our party into empty 2 booths, and even then he reluctantly accepted.
The waitress Amber was friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. Recommended drinks and items.
Ordered the chipotle cream chicken. The others in my party ordered the torta de milanesa, torta de carnitas and chipotle chicken. The food was surprisingly great, very tasty and authentic. Our meal concluded with Chef Paco delivering our deserts (I redeemed the Yelp offer for free flan ) which was yummy. With the exception of the manager overall  the place is great and opened 24/7 and good for kids despite being next door to Saphire strip club.
