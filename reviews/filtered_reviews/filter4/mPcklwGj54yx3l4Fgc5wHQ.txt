Mmmmm ... tasty. My friend and I split a giant entree for maybe $15, two frozen margaritas at $3 each, and I had a draft beer for $3.5. The meal for two was $40 with a generous tip. The ginormous tamales were especially memorable. It was what I expect Phoenix to be. And the cuisine is different from Mexican in Dallas or Albuquerque. Nice fresh salsas.
