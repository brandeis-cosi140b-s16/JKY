Ode to Taco Tuesday 

Cien Agave, how I love thee 
Where else can I go to get tacos for free!? 
Well, technically they are not free, but still 
Only $1 a piece, it's an absolute steal! 

Your Tecate Light is so refreshing and crisp 
And at only $2, I can have multiple sips! 
If darker beer is more your fare, 
Have a Modelo, it's not that much more! 

The tequila you serve makes your Margs quite delish 
All food so divine, I have only one wish! 
Only one day a week is not enough, I say 
Let's celebrate Taco Tuesday EVERY DAY! 

TT fans - this little poem sums it up! If you want cheap food and drinks, good service, cool ambiance, and just an overall place to go, Cien Agave's on Tuesday nights is the place for you!
