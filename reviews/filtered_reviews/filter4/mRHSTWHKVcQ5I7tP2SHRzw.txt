I don't do happy hour anymore so it was nice to just kinda stumble upon this place.

Decent drink specials along with a menu of tasty appetizers.
A few bites of various items on the menu and we were happy campers.

The decor is fabulous.  I was wishing they were a little closer to where I live because I would go there more often.
The restrooms were, interesting.  I got a chuckle out of passing through the shared washroom but thought it was rather ingenious -less space needed and thus more room to seat more customers.  ;-)  
Saw even more to appreciate as we were leaving through the patio.  

We decided then we would be back.
