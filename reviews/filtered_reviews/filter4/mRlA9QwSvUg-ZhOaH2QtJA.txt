The taco selection is super unique! Who's ever had mashed potatoes in their taco?!?! Amazing flavor!! Loved the ambiance and decor of the place. It's small but how they've designed it really opens up the room. Everything from the water they pour you to how your tacos are presented is different and classy. The prices were relatively cheap and the service was great! Definitely will be coming back again! Their Happy Hour is a great deal!
