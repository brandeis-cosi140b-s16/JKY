My brother and I have been going to Juan's for years. It is family owned and they recognize us every time we walk in. The service is solid, but they do get busy during lunch so sometimes you do have to be a little patient depending on the time you are eating. The food is good and cheap. I recommend the #1 with a soft chicken taco and a green beef burro. I also like the #22 which is a steak burrito with onions, peppers, guacamole and comes with a side of rice and beans.
