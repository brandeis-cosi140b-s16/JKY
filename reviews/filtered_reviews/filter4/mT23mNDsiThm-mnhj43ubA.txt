I've been going to Macayo's since I moved to the Valley in 96. Love this place. Great place to go for lunch, happy hour or dinner. They have great food, decent beer selection and its near the college. The salsa that they bring to the table is some of the best salsa around. Great balance of flavors and they keep bringing you more as your bowl runs dry. 

If you're in Tempe and want some good local mexican grub....this is the spot!
