This place has super tasty food and a lively, fun atmosphere.  Situated in the eclectic, artsy NoDa neighborhood of Charlotte, Cabo Fish Taco offers plenty of Southern CA/Baja style dishes, all prepared with lots of flavor and freshness.  We were told their fish taco specials are offered based on fresh selections so we tried the calamari tacos and rare tuna tacos (neither on the printed menu).  Both were extremely good, each with a unique sauce to compliment.  Their side dishes are loaded with flavor and make sure to order one of Charlotte's local brews...they offer several!!  In addition to a dining area, they have outdoor seating (draped and heated in the colder months) and a large bar.  Just be aware that sitting near the front door can be a little drafty on a cold night.
