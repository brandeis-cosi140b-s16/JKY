My first visit here , I was in  the area and saw the shop, they opened in 30 min so I killed some time in the area waiting .  It was well worth it.  
I was greeted by a mask wearing piano player and amazed with the fun decor . I had to remind myself I was there for lunch and not taking taking pics :).  
As it was my first visit the server gave me samples of the meats . I only had to sample a few to know I'd love them all.  Juicy and flavorful , spicy, delicious . 
I ordered the 5 tacos, side of rice and beans . They didn't have horchata ready yet so I had pop. 
I tried all the topping except lettuce.  Everything was fresh and tasty. Beans were great, rice was cilantro lime perhaps? Nice bright flavor .  Tried their salsa bar and liked them all. 
Posted pics to my FB and spread the word to my friends . I'll be back !
