Okay let me start by saying the food was boooooomb! It's hard to find good authentic Mexican food, no actually it's kind of hard to find good local take out spots in general in Vegas. But this place right here is a hidden gem. They have 3 different ordering stations ( really confusing for a first timer) one is for tacos, one for burritos, I forget what the other one was for. I wanted to try a lot of dishes thus I was kind of bopping back and fourth between counters. 

So, though the food was amazing, cheesy, greasy (in a good way ), nice portion size...I can't give 5 stars because their register set up is weird. Okay so every item you get they wrap in foil and put a different color sticker on it then hand it to you to put on your tray. Simple enough. NO! I get to the cashier she analyzes for a sec then starts punching in numbers, then she says some astronomical amount to me. I'm like no I only had this this and this. So this time she lifts each foil to see what it is, and now it's only $20 HUH?! 

Figure out your sticker / foil system and you have a winner. I'll be back!!!!!
