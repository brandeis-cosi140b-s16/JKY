Met up with some of my favorite folks last night because I NEEDED some cheese enchiladas paired with a margarita or two.  This little place has great service and really nice servers and wait staff...it was an enjoyable evening from start to finish.  The food is good ol' sonoran-style and I changed up my regular order to include green chile .  Yum Yum Yum!!!!  I like the fact that there are vegetarian options and the prices are really reasonable.  One of my friends has been eating there weekly for several years now so that's a pretty high recommendation.  I'm finding out that they have other regulars as well.  Still looking for the perfect red sauce but this place is OK in my book.
