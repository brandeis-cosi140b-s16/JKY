In a town full of  posh and expensive restaurants, back to basics Mexican food at Roberto's is alright wit me. The food is consistently fresh and yummy. Best of all they have a Yummalicious Breakfast burrito! I have been searching all of Vegas for the best breakfast burrito and think I have found it. It has eggs, potatoes, pico de gallo, and perfectly crispy bacon (or carne asada) or whatever else you want inside. Just the perfect size for a hangover!
