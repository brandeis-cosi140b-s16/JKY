I love going to So-Cal fish taco. The place is a bit small and there isn't a ton of seating available, but the food is really good and reasonably priced. I'm not a big fish eater but I do enjoy the fish tacos from here. I usually get steak though. The food is always fresh and delicious. It's a nice atmosphere, always kept clean / neat and its in a cool part of town. The staff is always helpful as well. I will continue to go to so-cal anytime my wife and I want some good tacos. Actually, now that I am writing this review, I am getting hungry just thinking about it. I might just stop in for some fish tacos today! Keep doing what you do so-cal. I will be back for sure. The only reason it's not a 5 star is because the dining area is so small. Otherwise, everything is fantastic.
