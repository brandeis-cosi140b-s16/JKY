Love this local restaurant/bar. The staff is always friendly and remember your favorites after you have been there a few times.  Anything with their green chili is amazing. The jalape√±o mashed potatoes are delicious.  If you feel like something spicy try the habanera burger, it can set your mouth on fire. 
The patio is great for both warm summer nights and chilly winter evenings.  The place is dimly lit which adds to the bat cave ambiance.
