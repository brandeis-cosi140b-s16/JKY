So, after reading reviews of this place on yelp I decided I had to try it. I have been trying to find the real best burger in Las Vegas and I know it ain't on the strip. We entered and were greeted by a nice young man who immediately took our order. We got 2 bacon cheeseboygers and shared an order of fries.  The meat in the burger was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside and seasoned perfectly. The bacon was crispy and all the ingredients went well together. The burger was reminiscent of a Fatburger with regards to toppings and the way it is put together. 5 stars.  The fries were hot and had seasoned salt on them so they kind of reminded me of Farm Basket fries, another 5 stars. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is because they offer chili verde on their mexican food but didn't know what a green chile was when I asked if I could have one on my burger. I had to go on and describe it as an anaheim chile then my gf said Ortega chile and the lady knew what we meant but sadly no green chiles for the burgers (kind of makes me wonder where they get the chili verde from if not from green chiles). I would totally recommend the burgers and I will go back to try the chencho fries (fries with green chile, cheese and chopped chicken) and have already recommended them to friends.
