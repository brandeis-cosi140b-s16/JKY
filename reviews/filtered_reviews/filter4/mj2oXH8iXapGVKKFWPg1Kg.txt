4 friends enjoying mexican.  We walked in around 8 o'clock on a Friday night and had no problem getting a table outside.  At first glance, I prob. wouldn't have eaten here.  It was in a strip mall, and really not appealing from the outside.  There was a glow of the red light reading Valle Luna, and neon writing on the glass windows advertisiting the specials and NFL ticket (it's not football season).  

Anyway, we had good service and the food was great.

Pros:
I loved the chips, salsa, and black bean/refried bean dip they gave us for an app.  

The portions were HUGE!  I suggest splitting or come prepared to take home.  

Outdoor seating

Neat canopy like booths and tables inside, transporting you to another place

$20 off $60 coupon

Fajitas were able to come with two different meats for no additional charge

All food was really hot (temp wise).

Cons:
One of the frozen margaritas came out not blended.  The fruit was on the bottom, still whole, and the ice and booze was taking up the top of the glass.  Our waitress, Jenni, had no problem bringing a beer in place of the unsatisfactory drink.
