Went to Dick's on the recommendation of the New Times Best of Phoenix issue. It's a little hard to find, but I guess it lives up to its name. It's cozy; it's little more than a long bar, a kitchen and a few tables. However, this small restaurant delivered some big flavors. I had a burrito dish that the bartender said was the place's signature dish. The pulled pork inside the burrito was delicious, and it was topped with cheese and a bold, spicy red pepper sauce.

There are no frills here. The sole TV was small and playing a Spanish soccer match when I went. With a lack of distraction and close quarters, you'd better have a good conversationalist when you go.
