Second chances are a good thing right? I decided to give this place a 2nd chance and introduce a co worker.

It was entertaining ot see my coworkers reaction to the 3rd world conditions inside, and his attitude change once he bit into this burrito.

The food is the real star here with the tortillas as the backbone. I recommend getting your burrito foot long style for $.85 more. Not only is it unique it ends up being a decent value as you get 33-50% more than a usual burrito.

The chips are nothing special but I do like the hot sauce in the ketchup style pumps.
