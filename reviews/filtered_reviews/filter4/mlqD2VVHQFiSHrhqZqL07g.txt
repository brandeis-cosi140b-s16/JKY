Holy guacamole, batman! 

Definitely order some as it's so fresh and delicious, but keep in mind that you will receive a ridiculously large amount served with warm tortilla chips. Went last night with a group of six people and we couldn't finish the bowl, which is unprecedented.

This was my second visit to Vida, and it was just as delicious as the first time. The decor is quite trendy (check out wood chunks in the floor) and the bar area is large and generally busy from just after 5 p.m. until the wee hours. There are a ton of seating options as well as an upstairs area that's great for small groups. 

Our server was a bit slow last night, although other servers/food runners were all over keeping our water glasses and chip bowls full. The chicken and corn enchiladas, garlic shrimp quesadillas, and chicken tacos ordered at our table were all very good. And the plantains are a must have if you're a fan. Keep in mind that portion sizes are humongous, so you may want to share. And for beverages, there is a full bar, multiple beer and wine choices, and skinny margaritas or sangria for those who would like a specialty drink.

Uptown needed a solid Mexican option, and Vida has definitely fit the bill. Salud!
