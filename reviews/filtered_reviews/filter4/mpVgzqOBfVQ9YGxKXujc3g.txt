The food here is your average American-Mexican food. 

There are always Chips and salsa. If you're lucky enough to get a fresh batch they are wonderful.  I love that they don't cake them with salt. 

The food is consistent and spicy. Their carne asada is my favorite. 

But the reason we continue to visit is a certain waiter named Kevin. He is exceptional. Upbeat, enthused and never ever let's a cup run dry. He makes you feel special and continues to provide excellent service. He deserves a raise.
