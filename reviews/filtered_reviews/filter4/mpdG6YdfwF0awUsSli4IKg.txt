I read a review from Norm K. and just had to check this place out! Boy, am I glad I did. I ordered the special also as he suggested " Pork Veracruz" and it was delicious. The "Vegetable Soup w/ Meatball Soup" was just as savory. I posted some photos, I will definitely be back soon.  Overall...the food is excellent and you must order the Flan.
