A group of us went to Diablo's for lunch this past Saturday and were seated right away.  Prices weren't bad for the three of us at a prime establishment on the strip and everything was delivered hot and cooked to order.

The drinks were poured heavy (which was nice) and we left feeling full and satiated.
