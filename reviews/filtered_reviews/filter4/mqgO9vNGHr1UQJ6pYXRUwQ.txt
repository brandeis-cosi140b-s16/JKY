My parents originally brought me to Nando's and I started to like it more and more with each visit. I turned vegetarian about 14 months ago and was pleased that I could still eat here with my parents when I came to visit them. Chips are thinly crisp and the salsa tastes very fresh. They guacamole taco, as simple as it is, is very very tasty. Their black beans are also delicious. I've also had the vegetable tacos with grilled veggies, the potato jack taco, which is like mashed potatoes with spicy jack cheese, and the enchiladas. All great vegetarian options. Prices are good and servings are large. The coconut margarita is also worth mentioning.
