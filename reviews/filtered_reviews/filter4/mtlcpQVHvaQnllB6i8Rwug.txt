It was 2 in the afternoon and neither of us had anything to eat yet..  So we were beyond famished...we were becoming irritable.  We decided to quickly scan the Grand Canal for a place to eat...we didn't want a super fancy restaurant at the hotel to have lunch.  We passed the food court...and thought nah!  Saw Canonita and said, let's try Mexican in Vegas.  

The decor at Taqueria Canonita is characterized by high-ceilings, bright bold colors, Mexican tiles and Mexican art. Taqueria Canonita offers outside patio dining beside the Grand Canal which offers views of the Venetian streetscape and passing gondolas.

We started with guacomole and chips.  The guac was fantastic...I could have just eaten that with a spoon.  Great texture, very chunky and flavorful.  My entree was thePescado Vera Cruz - fresh catch of the day (happened to be Mahi Mahi that day) sauteed w/ sweet chiles, red onions, green olives, and lemon all simmered with a hearty marisco broth and white rice.  It was yummy.  I'd get that again if I wanted to eat on the light said.  

He ordered the Colima Pollo con Limon - grilled chicken breast marinated w/ lime and roasted garlic topped w/ chayote and red cabbage salad, seasonal grilled vegetable and borracho beans.  I wish I had ordered that instead.  Not only did it look yummy, it was great!  The chicken was tender and juicy.

Total bill with tip:  $58
