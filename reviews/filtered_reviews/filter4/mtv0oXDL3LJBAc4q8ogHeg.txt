Mmmm...  $1 tacoooos...

Say you're playing poker at Bally's.  Aaand you get a little hungry at, like, I dunnooo, 4am.  You've had your fill of the $4.99 steak and eggs from the neighboring Bill's Casino Victorian Room.  You don't feel like driving, or even walking very far.  Cruise on over to the Tequila Bar.  $1 tacos (beef or chicken, hard or soft shelled) come to the rescue.  They're pretty dang good, and come with a side of salsa and sour cream.

The $1 margaritas ($2 for strawberry) are available, but I say pass.  As a player I can tip a buck for any drink I want.  The margarita from the machine wouldn't be my first choice out on the floor, and it wouldn't be here either.

But here's the real deal with the Tequila Bar: they accept your Bally's players card comps.  Bally's comps you $1 for every hour of poker you play, for example.  That's like earning a taco an hour for playing.  Not too shabby.

So, in conclusion, enjoy the tacos.  They're not even $1.  They're free.
