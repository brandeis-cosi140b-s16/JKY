Let me just start off by saying that the place is absolutely beautiful! I love how they put their own twist to the old church! The place was packed during lunch time, but our server was still attentive and friendly. I got the trio tacos with street corn. A skirt steak taco I think- it was ok, the chicken taco- it was good and the veggie taco- phenomenal! So was the street corn! It was all really messy to eat and I probably looked like I was eating like as 2 year old, but I didn't care. I will definitely be going back for happy hour. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because the salsa wasn't very impressive. I mean, I still ate it and everything, but it needed something.. I think a taco place should always have amazing salsa.
