Went for late night happy hour with my work compadres. They offer sopitos, quesdaillas, nachos, cheese stuffed jalape√±os, and tacos for $3-5. Portions are huge! They also offer margaritas and beers for $3-4. With a spectacular view of the Vegas strip and a freshly made margarita for $3.50, you'll be extremely happy with this happy hour. Much better late night Mexican fix than some sketchy take out...

Chips, salsa, and bean dip are complimentary.
