We ate here for a late night snack. The hostess was not the warmest but they did get us seated in 15 minutes on a busy Friday night. Our waiter was welcoming and broughts chips and salsa immediately to the table. We ordered two appetizers (SHRIMP QUESADILLA and BEEF FLAUTAS), with very specific ingredient requests, and they were delicious. The food was hot, prepared as requested, and had a very nice presentation. Overall a great experience.
