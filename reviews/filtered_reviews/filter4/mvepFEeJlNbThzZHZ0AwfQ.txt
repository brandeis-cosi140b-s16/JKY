A one man operation. The guy that works here is the only employee so he knows what's going on! 

Great value and good food. Don't steer away because this is located inside the Sinclair gas station. 

I usually try to live by the motto: Don't fuel your body where you fuel your car.  This place is the exception to that rule. 

Thumbs up!
