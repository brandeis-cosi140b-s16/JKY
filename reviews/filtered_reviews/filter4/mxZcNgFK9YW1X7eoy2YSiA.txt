At least I know everything will be good (so far).  I hate eating bad Mexican food because I love it so much.  Authentic seems hard to find here, but I'll settle for consistent reminiscence of it.  The ground beef tacos and cilantro rice are great, the salsa actually is not runny, and the guac is good.  On the weekend, the chicken with mole special was pretty good though I could only make it through a few bites after all the pre-dinner snacking.  No More Chips!
