I'm a big fan of small, non-chain, family-owned Mexican places in buildings that look like they've been here since the 60s. This place was clean, the personnel were kind folks and when I sank my teeth into the red beef taco, I told my Dad it was the best taco I've eaten. TONS of meat, the sauce was yummy and very affordable all around. I ended up buying 6 more just to take home and freeze for later!

The patio out back is awesome, however I'd love to also sit out in the front and watch humanity go by. So we sat in the car instead. 

I'll totally be back!
