I wouldn't expect anything less than a delicious meal if I'm eating at a restaurant with a menu created by an iron chef, and Distrito delivered.  This restaurant cooks up some pretty flavorful dishes and serves up some strong and tasty cocktails.  With a really good $40 for $20 gift certificate from Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/phoenix?ref=19485), my dad and I met up for "brunch" Sunday afternoon.  I put that in quotes because it's really just the lunch menu with some breakfast items slapped on.  I bet the pancakes are good, but we were here for the mexican fare.

I ate the Pecado Tacos.  Grilled fish, cabbage, a slice of avocado, and a fried plantain with a chipotle sauce.  It may sound like a fairly basic fish taco, but I sure taste better than anything basic.  The only negative is that you get three normal sized tacos with nothing else.  You may want to order a side to go with it if you need something to fill you up for more than an hour or two.  My Dad had the Torta Milanesa.  A chicken cutlet, avocado, queso oaxaca, and watercress in a big hard bun.  All I have to say, is wow, what a sandwich.  If you're looking for a unique drink, have the Naranja Roja.  It has blood orange liqueur, blood orange pur√©e, and habanero.  You can really feel the kick from the peppers.  The alcohol is poured generously.

My only real complaint is that the service was a little slow.  Drinks took some time.  And after we received the check, it took forever for someone to take it off the table and run the credit card.  But the servers were as friendly and hospitable as can be.
