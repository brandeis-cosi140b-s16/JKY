We live nearby so we eat here every now and then. The food is always good - so are the margaritas. My favorite was the berry berry - and I was impressed to see that they used real, fresh berries in it. YUM!

I do wish they would get rid of the whacky African animal motif. But they've been on that corner forever and I guess it's a "thing" by now.
