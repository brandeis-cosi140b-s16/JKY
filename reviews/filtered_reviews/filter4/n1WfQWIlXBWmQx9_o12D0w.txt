Visited for lunch.  Not a huge dining area, but we just beat the rush.  Had the empanadas appetizer.  It was pretty good.  I had the green chile burger with the sweet potato chile fries.  The burger was tasty but it could have been a little spicier.  The fries were sweet, but not too sweet.  Husband had the pernil torta.  He really liked it.  Prices were reasonable.  Our waitress was friendly, informative about the menu and took care of us.  I actually prefer Fuego CityScape over Fuego Tacos and Fuego Bistro.
