My husband and I live downtown, and Sam's has become one of our favorite regular spots (bonus that the AMC theater is right there, too!). The chips are great- a variety of veggie, tortilla, and won-ton chips mixed in one basket. The tortilla soup, quesadillas, and especially the carnitas plate are all highly recommended. The Orange Beso margarita is so delicious and so big we always split one. The seafood pasta was acceptable, which is almost high praise in Phoenix where most of the seafood we've had is downright nasty. We've never had room for dessert, but the white chocolate/pecan corn husk is the perfect little bit of sweet at the end of the meal. Prices are fair and the outdoor seating is cool, but can be a little loud when they are crowded and the waterfalls are running in the courtyard. The service has always been good to excellent.
