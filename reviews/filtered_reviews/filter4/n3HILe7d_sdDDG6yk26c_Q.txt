Showed up for a NYE dinner here a few nights ago and was very pleased. Mexican is definitely not my favorite food but I thoroughly enjoyed Gallo Blanco. From the guacamole to the corn and then my ribeye sandwich, everything was delicious. I wish there was a chicken taco available, maybe there was but I missed it. Great margaritas as well.
