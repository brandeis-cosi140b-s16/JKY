Loved it! I brought my dad here for a Father's Day lunch. The service was terrific! They had just opened a few weeks ago. The cocktails and Aqua Frescas were    unique and so delicious. I was told that they come in early to prepare the drink mixes from scratch. I tried three tacos; the fish was my favorite. The chicken was a bit spicy, the pork was ok. I will definitely return and will be bringing my friends!
