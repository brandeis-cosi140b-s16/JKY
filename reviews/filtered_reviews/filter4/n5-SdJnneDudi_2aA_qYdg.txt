Loved the food and drink! 

The nachos with muchaca under the appetizer menu was GINORMOUS, it was so much food between the two of us, we could not finish it. The blue type margaritas that are presently on special for $2 a piece, all day, are fantastic.

Our server was super cool and on top of her game and for a total of four drinks and the increadibly large appitizer, we paid $27. How can you beat that?!
