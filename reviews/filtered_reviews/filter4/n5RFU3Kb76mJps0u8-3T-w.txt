We really like Juan's . The service is consistently excellent and Juan is cordial and hardworking.

Lunch is a super deal.  We really enjoy the chicken fajitas.  Have found the steak fajitas to be tough and the shrimp tend to get overcooked.  Stick with the chicken and you will be happy.

Chicken chimichanga was large, but salty.  Ice tea tastes freshly brewed.

My very critical 86 year old mother gives  Juan's the thumbs up.  I don't know a better recommendation than that.
