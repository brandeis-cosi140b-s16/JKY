First time here and it was very good!  The many different salsas at the salsa bar are very good.  My husband had their version of a "torta" I would recommend sticking with the tacos. The steak and white fish tacos are amazing!  

Only bad thing is it not very big and tables are close to each other.  Service was slow but the food made up for that. I would definitely return!
