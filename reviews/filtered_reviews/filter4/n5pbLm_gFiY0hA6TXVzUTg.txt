In town for the Stella and Dot conference, after our second day I was determined to eat here!  I am a huge fan of Jose Andres and could not wait!

I perused the menu online and saw that they do take out which was awesome!!  I placed my order, I decided on the tacos de lengua, cooked in pasillas and a Saison DuPont (beer).  
China Poblano is in the Cosmopolitan, a beautiful hotel and casino that is across from Planet Hollywood.  The restaurant is brightly colored, reds that invoke both asian and mexican influences.  

The take out window is a nice touch and my food was ready!  The smells from the kitchen were enticing but I was surprised to not see the restaurant portion not completely packed.  

The tacos were good, the meat was tender and cooked they my mom used to cook it!  The tortillas were nice I wish they put two, because they put so much meat into the tacos, a second one would've have helped!  I liked them, I wished it had more pasillas but it was good.  Jose Andres' Jaleo is wonderful, all of his tapas have wonderful flavor.  I was hoping the tacos would too, maybe if I went with the pork or lobster ones.

I like China Poblano, next I will make a reservation and order an entree.  The selection of beers are great!  The Saison I had was delish and refreshing.  @JoseAndres you are a great chef and I love ThinkFood Group!
