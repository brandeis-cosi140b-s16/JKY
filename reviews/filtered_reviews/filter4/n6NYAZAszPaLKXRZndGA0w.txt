If you're hungry and you know it clap your hands! Not sure where that came from, but this place will offer tasty tacos and Mexican delights at late hours of the night! 

Had some flautas and drinks here, and overall had a good time. The bartender was very down to earth and always attentive. This seems to be popular little hangout spot for locals and tourists alike. A great place to grab a tasty snack and drinks.
