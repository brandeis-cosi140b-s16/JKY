Normally I try a local restaurant than a chain restaurant which serve similar food. My friend wanted to go Chipotle as he was not sure abt the food at this place but I stick to "Phat Burrito" after reading the good reviews. Glad I did. I ordered Fish burrito and Steak taco. I asked for everything in my burrito and oh boy it was the best fish burrito I had so far. I hate smelly fish burrito but this fish has no smell and had a very unique taste. Steak taco was ok and can be skipped.

Bottom line: I will return for my Fish burrito, if I'm in Charlotte.
