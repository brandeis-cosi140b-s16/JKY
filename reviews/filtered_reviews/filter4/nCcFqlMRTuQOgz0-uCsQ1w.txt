I love Mexican food!!! One of the first things I always try when I go to a new place is the Chiles Rellenos.  Its a great benchmark for the overall quality, "tastyness", and value of most everything on the menu.

Is the chili fresh and prepared well? (Hatch or not Hatch).  YES, YES, YES good job!  & fresh roasted Hatch chili!!!   Is the chili stuffed with a delectable Mexican cheese mix (or just  jack cheese)?  Well, this place uses a Good mix of jack & something else....no complaints.   What kind of batter? egg? breading?  Not sure but whatever they use it works well.

All in all, the Chiles Rellenos here are great!    Beware it's a very spicy dish so don't order it if you don't like it hot!  

My hubby ordered the fish & chips?  I know!   But they came and they are beautiful, crispy, large, flaky, flavorful, awesome!  Looks like they do a good job with everything on the menu!
