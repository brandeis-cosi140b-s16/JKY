My wife and I always start off our trips to Las Vegas with lunch at the Pink Taco. It's one of our favorite Mexican places to eat in Las Vegas.

It's traditional Tex-Mex fare,but it's all pretty good. Make sure you get some of the guacamole. Don't load up too much on the chips & salsa (even though its hard not too). Make sure you leave enough room to enjoy your entree.

The service is usually pretty prompt & attentive also. Can't wait to go back.
