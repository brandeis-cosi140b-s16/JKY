ARRIBA, ARRIBA!!!

I could of mistaken myself for being on the other side of the border.

Right when you sit down they great you with fresh tortilla chips and hot and mild salsa, and bean dip.

My dad, and little brother enjoy that taste of the creamy, spicy, triple "pepper" rated, Steak Tapico;  a tenderloin steak smothered with Hatch chile and queso fundido and served with a cheese enchilada and  rice. They both hate guacamole and black beans so they ordered double rice, and the waiter delivered exactly what they ordered. Based on how hot the food is, they rate each of their foods with peppers, on the menu.

My mother and i, ordered something with little less of a kick, and loved the Chimichanga Plate; a huge flour tortilla, with your choice of beef, ground beef, chicken, and either red or green chile. The sour cream was just the thing to top it all off. With the rice and beans on the side, it was enough to leave the place content.

The staff were dressed in traditional mexican, festive outfits, that make it a fun, exciting evening for the family, no matter what ages. 

The prices range from pretty cheap to moderate, but without the need of an appetizer, it leaves you with your pockets still heavy.

We got there around 7, and it was packed, but we got in within a 10-15 minute wait, and the staff were pretty friendly. The food could of made up for it.

It was a pretty clean, comfortable place, and ill be sure to visit again.
