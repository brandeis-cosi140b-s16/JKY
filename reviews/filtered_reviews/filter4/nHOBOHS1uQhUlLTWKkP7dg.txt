Street corn was expertly executed. My husband was getting over a cold and we needed to be careful about how we shared dishes, so we took the server up on her offer to have the corn served off the cob. That was probably the way to go with this dish as it was creamy, flavorful and super easy to share. There's no way anyone sane would pass this menu item up.

The duck empanadas were good -- the portion was massive for an appetizer item, so good value there. One of the sauces on the plate was too sweet but easily avoided in favor of the more preferred alternate sauce.

We also ordered the salmon entree that was an extremely appropriate serving size. Not "tapas" small but not generous enough to take home -- which we appreciate considering the ridiculous portioning Americans have become used to...

Lastly, the bread pudding was fantastic. The pepitas and pomegranate seeds gave just enough texture and acidity to round it out. So yum. 

Service = friendly, attentive and prompt. Only bad side was being seated next to the water & plates/flatware station which is always distracting...maybe they should just remove that table from the floor so no diners need to feel they're in the way of the staff.
