Overall this is a very good restaurant.  The staff are very nice, the prices are good, the service is fast, and the food is very tasty.

Paradise doesn't deliver in spades however.  It lacks in location and the environment could use work.  Things like uncomfortable chairs and only having Sweet N Low keep this from being a five star review.

Paradise has the potential to go big, it is definitely a restaurant worthy of expansion.
