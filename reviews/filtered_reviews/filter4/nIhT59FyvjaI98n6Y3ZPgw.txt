I think it's great when an entrepreneur comes up with a new concept.  This whole idea of enchiladas and soup is really cool and I'll bet he opens several more locations.

I had the tomatillo chicken and modelo braised short rib enchiladas.  Red and green sauces, honey vinaigrette slaw, jalapeno ranch dressing pico de gallo and cojita cheese.  Super yummy!

I also had some chips, salsa and a beer.

Overall it was a great meal.

I'd like to see a little more selection of beer (craft) and the table I sat at wasn't bussed from the previous diner's mess until halfway through my meal.
