I'm not a big fan of sushi but my boyfriend loves it and he's been wanting to try the place out for the past week or two. I love burritos so I decided to try it out with him. At first it was overwhelming looking at the menu because of all the options and I didn't know half the things that were up there, but just like at Subway you get the option to pick what you want on your sushi burrito and it was easy to just point at the clear glass and tell them you want "that" on it. 
For me and him both, it equaled up to $20 which isn't too bad.
Even though I don't like sushi I really enjoyed it and my boyfriend loved it. If you don't like sushi, I still recommend you trying it out and if you're a big fan of sushi then you should definitely go here!
Great food and friendly staff :)
