I really dig this place. A nice little gem in the mix of all of these low quality spots in Phoenix. I'm not a fan of buffets for obvious reasons and don't like supporting franchised businesses. 

The Pros:

1.  Great food in general. They don't over season their food to mask good flavors. Really nice balance and a nice touch by using cabbage instead of iceberg lettuce. By the way, lettuce has no nutritional value at all. It's a cheap filler used to rip off customers. Cabbage is full of great nutrition and eventually full of farts if you eat too much of it. The burritos are monstrous. I would eat half and then save it for later on in the day. Really great price for good food.

3.  Unique daily specials. It's worth coming back each day to check what they've dreamed up. The daily drinks are flavored with Monin, which is a simple syrup flavoring. So good.

2.  Very friendly staff who keep it simple. Order your food, they write it down on a paper bag, you get your food from the window in the back seating area. There's a good amount of parking as well. If an order isn't up to par just let them know and they'll fix it for you.

4.  I love the decor of this place. It oozes the laid-back vibe of a taco stand. You have no choice but to eat outside in the fresh air instead of inside of a stale place.
