Oddly enough, I found this place while working at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, MD. There was a location in the food court at the exchange there. Being from AZ, I was craving good fast mexican food and the offerings in MD consisted of Taco Bell. But this place is legit. Great carne asada, which is my go to. And they even had jamaica and horchata. Thanks for saving my palate while I was in DC.
