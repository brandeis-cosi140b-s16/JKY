Everyone, please calm down!!! This is NOT a fancier Tacos El Gordo. Relax. Breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth....I know we're all excited Henderson/Silverado Ranch finally got a legit Mexican joint but this is not Gordo so stop comparing! Sorry to break the news guys. 

Yes-this is the best thing that has happened to Henderson and Republic Kitchen and look forward to strolling my hungover a** in here in my stilettos for some late night tacos...so yay to this! 

Had the Al pastor, Barbacoa, & Asada-pretty darn good! Noticed they had quite the selection in meats...can't wait to try them all. The salsa bar is fully-loaded, the restaurant was very clean and borderline fancy. (let's see how long that lasts) 

Tossing out 4 stars because the food was delicious, and would hate to see this place go anytime soon....with that said; this does not come close to TEG! (Tacos El Gordo) 

Keep it classy, peeps!
