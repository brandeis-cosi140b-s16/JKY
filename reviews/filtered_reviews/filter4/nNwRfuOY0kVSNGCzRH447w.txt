The food here is fantastic, the atmosphere is great, and the servers are very friendly.  This is our "go to" place for out of town guest to experience wonderful Mexican food.  Why then do I not give 5 stars, well, its quite simple, their take-out system is pretty mediocre.  My view, either be better at take-out, or don't do it.  We do take out from there often (as we love the food), but beware they are almost always later than expected, often lose your ticket, or the food will be cold.  I think they would be better served by nixing take-out, although I would be devastated since I get it often.  My solution has become, I order take-out, then go and wait immediately, to avoid cold food or delayed expectations.  I will say every time our food has been truly subpar, they have made it right, and that the customer service of this place is far and away the best in the valley.
