Let me tell you, Sabor is a small place that's mucho GRANDE in flavor.

My friend and I went on Friday afternoon which also happened to be #NationalTequilaDay (*praise hands emoji*) so our imbibing of the $4 margaritas was quite fitting and delicious. I easily sucked mine down and could've had another if I didn't have plans to drive afterward. Being that it was just after 5:00 p.m., it wasn't busy so we were able to walk right in and place our orders.

I went with the chicken empanada, fish taco, and large serving of guacamole to share. My friend ordered the chorizo empanada and a chicken arepa. While we waited, we took a sampling of the salsa bar. Definitely was not impressed with the mild salsa flavor which tasted more like salsa water. All of the salsas seemed like they had been sitting out for a while so we stuck with the guac.

Initially, I was a little taken by surprise at the size of the empanada but soon that turned into gratitude because I ate every single bite and wished that it would magically double in size. The dough was lightly crispy and the chicken was juicy and flavorful and I need another one right now.

The fish taco fell apart on me but I just picked up a fork and ate the insides. It was all right but not anything I would order again. I tried a piece of my friend's arepa and thought it was good but nothing particularly stood out for me. 

I want to thank Sabor for my newly-found adoration for empanadas.
