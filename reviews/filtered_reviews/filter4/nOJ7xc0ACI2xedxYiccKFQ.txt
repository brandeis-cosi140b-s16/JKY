Im drooling just thinking about this place!!! Once again, had a bad craving for Mexican food and was across the street. SOOOOOO good. First, the fact that they brought out salsa AND bean dip, I love. Not everyone likes salsa, I liked having a little of both. Both were good. I ordered the 3 cheese chimi with jalapeno cream cheese. OHHH MY GOSH!!! One of the best items ive had, of all Mexican food dishes!!! Obsessed. Probably will only order that from here on out at this place. The waitress was so nice, and attentive. Margarita was cheap and good. AND on sundays kids eat free. Good food cheap liquor and free to feed the kid?! Winner in my book!
