The lines are super long, but it's worth the wait. I had adobada fries, an al pastor taco and like 1/4 of an al pastor mula. The food was great! The fries were not like any I've had before! The guacamole is super creamy! Delish! I didn't like that the lines are separated by meat type. It restricts you to really only getting one type of meat/food instead of a variety. We also had to eat in our car since the place was so packed and there wasn't a place to sit. If you come, prepare for a long wait.
