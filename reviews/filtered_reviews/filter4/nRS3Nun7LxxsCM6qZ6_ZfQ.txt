I say give this place another try - the first time I came to Loco Lime I really wasn't that impressed my tacos were extremely plain and boring but I did enjoy my jalapeno margarita a lot.  However I went back again and think I ordered the right thing this time... some crab queso and a veggie burrito...now I wish they filled my veggie burrito with more veggies but it was a nice combo - rice, portabella mushrooms, plantains, squash etc and get the red sauce it was tasty.

The service was also very good and the hostess let me know before she sat us that they were having dollar tacos if you sat in the bar area as well as $13.00 for mixed buckets of beer. Sunday nights for a cheap dinner this may be the place.
