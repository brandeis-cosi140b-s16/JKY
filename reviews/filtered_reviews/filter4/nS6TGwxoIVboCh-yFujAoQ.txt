When I think of fun Mexican in Charlotte, I think of Cantina 1511. While I'm a frequent visitor of the location in Dilworth, the location off Rea Road is just as good, though the ambiance is better in Dilworth. Margaritas are good and they usually always have Corona on special. Outside patio is fun too, especially for lunch on a nice day. The lunch specials are affordable and plentiful. 

For dinner, I'm a table side guac guy and a barbacoa fan. The barbacoa fills me up for only $12. Traditional food and some specialty fare allows for many choices. I do break out sometimes a go for the Enchiladas Dennis or the Carne Asada Quesadillas. Great for groups of friends or families. I've celebrated many of friends birthdays here. Great food and not too expensive for everyone.
