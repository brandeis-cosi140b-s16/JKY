I drive by Blanco's pretty regularly and I always notice it. I'm not sure if it's the brightly colored signage or the world "Tequila" that grabs my attention but I always think that it's a place I'd like to try. 

Tonight, I went for it. 

The hostess was friendly, greeted us right away and sat us right in front of the tv that was playing the 49er game. Was it our San Francisco gear that gave us away? 

Our waiter was nice, although I don't think he likes kids in his every day life, he handled it well. He was prompt on refills, checking in with us often, even giving us great recommendations. We all loved the food, many smiles all around.   

I was glad we chose Blanco's for dinner tonight, it was everything I hoped it would be. Next time, I'm trying one of their margaritas. :)
