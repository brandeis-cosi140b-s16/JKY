Not bad, not bad at all.  As a Burrito it's absolutely huge and even if you could, you shouldn't eat the whole thing.  I am a big fan of getting it as a bowl so I can actually take smaller bites with a fork without that whole fat girl shoving a giant burrito in her face look. Not sexy.

Still, though I worked but moments away for years, we didn't really go that often.  Could it be because there are better "Mexican" spots in the area?  Maybe.  Could it be because the lunch lines are a freaking joke occasionally extending outside the building itself?  Quite possible.  But I'm thinking another big factor was that after a big meal like that (as the guys I worked with though you weren't a man if you couldn't eat the whole thing) everyone just wanted to go back to work and take a nap.  

My advice - always get it to go, because you can expect that you'll always be taking some of it home!
