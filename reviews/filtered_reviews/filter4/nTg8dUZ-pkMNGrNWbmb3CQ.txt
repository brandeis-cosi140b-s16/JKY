Came here last night after seeing all the good reviews and wasn't disappointed. The space is very cute and ambiance was romantic. Only another couple there so service was very good and attentive. Started off with the watermelon Rose' sangria (pink) which was good although a little on the sweet side for me. The watermelon cubes in it were so juicy and good, sad there wasn't more in it. Ordered the guacamole right off the bat. Was supper fresh and delicious. Had homemade chips and salsa which were good as well. Some of the chips had seasoning on them that had a nice kick to them. Ordered the spicy grilled calamari in squid ink sauce. Wasn't kidding about the spice, the squid had a texture I'm not used to (on the soft chewy side). Probably wouldn't order again. Had the chicken mole that our server said was one of the best mole's he's ever had. it was pretty damn tasty. A little on the sweet side for me again, but it had very complex flavors. It was a flavor explosion on the first bite! The BF had the Mahi Mahi which was also recommended in a red sauce over rice. This was very nice as well. Good flavors going on here. This place seems to be a local favorite. I would definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas. THANK YOU FOR AN AWSOME MEAL! Sorry for no pics, it was really dark inside and taking shitty pictures of their delicious food wouldn't have done it justice.
