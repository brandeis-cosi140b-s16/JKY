Hideaway is apt description.  No signage of any sort.  Small footprint inside.  I liked it immediately.

For starters, we split the SKEWERS (2 wood grilled chicken, beef tenderloin, shrimp, and sausage skewers with dipping sauces) and the TOMATILLO TOAST (sauteed chicken and ham served over toast with green chile, mozzarella cheese, and tomatillo salsa).  What you say, there are no appetizers on the menu.  Please, you just order regular menu items as if they were in fact appetizers.  Both "appetizers" were extremely flavorful and that pecan wood they use is spectacular.  The only detractor was that the meats on them were on the overcooked side.

I went with a surf & turf type of entree (FILET MIGNON & LOBSTER TAIL) based upon our barman's recommendation.  It.  Was.  Awesome.  The filet was perfectly cooked, as was the lobster.  The dipping sauces really enhanced everything.  I even loved both sides (GCP or GREEN CHILE POTATO and SAUTEED ASPARAGUS & BROCCOLINI).  I usually save the best tasting piece of food for last, but to be honest, I had the hardest time deciding what that was going to be.

Seriously, if the appetizers weren't overcooked, Dick's would be a 5-starer for me.  Robust flavors, good service, and truly a find.  The other sad thing?  They were out of the flan.  Boo!

My last bite?  The lobster.
