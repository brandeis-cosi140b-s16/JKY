First time visit and I'm a fan! Tried a variety of margaritas--all were good--especially the avocado. Sample several dishes and there wasn't a bad one in the bunch.  The short rib tacos really stood out.  The only drawback were the desserts.  I wasn't overly impressed with any of them, and we tried them all.  All in all, the best meal in town!
