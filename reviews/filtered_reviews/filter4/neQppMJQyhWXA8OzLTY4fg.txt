It's my office holiday party, a group of young women, ready to blow off steam. What better place than here. 

It's an eclectic bar scene, you buy the drink by the yard, and be prepared for LOUD music, boisterious MC, getting the crowd roaring with dance and laughter. 

The food isn't anything special, just bar food, tacos, nachoes, and such, but it's the fun time you're guaranteed to have with a group of friends!
