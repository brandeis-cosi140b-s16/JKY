Here are a list of things I have tried and loved since my first visit here:

~White Sangria - loaded with tons of fruit, just like I like it.
~ Huevos Rancheros - despite the fact that the first one they brought out had runny egg whites,  they took it back and prepared my meal correctly, and I was pleased.
~Chilaquiles Verdes - I liked this best of all the dishes I tried at #smunch.
~Elote Callejero- ie: smothered corn.. You cant not love it.. its just too good.
~Margaritas - one of the best i've had in town! They are strong!

Here are a list of things that I hated:

~Pineapple Picoso - it had muddled red pepper in it too, which was a disgusting combo that I hated and do not recommend to anyone.
~Cantaloupe Spiked Water thing... Chad S. loved it, I think it's not so good.
~ $7 guacamole..  my plate of breakfast was cheaper than that!

Anyway, I dig this place, for the most part.
