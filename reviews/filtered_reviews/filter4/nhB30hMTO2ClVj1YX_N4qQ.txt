We came here to celebrate my mother in law's birthday. It was really good this time around- maybe we ordered better dishes. Hmm, Anyway, The four of us had dinner here for $46.00. My husband and I both got the fajita burrito, but I got the chicken and my husband got the beef. It was excellent- the burritos were huge. Mine was just as stated in the menu (chicken, onions, and peppers), my husband made a few changes. The burrito was served with green sauce and cheese on it and guacamole on the side. I didn't finish it, and took the rest home. My mother in law got the chimichanga (hers was huge too). Her husband got the two taco combo. And the birthday sombrero serenade with three halves of a churro and whipped cream. was funny. The tequila shot was also complimentary. The server called it "sugar and water." How funny. 

Next time, we're probably going to order the same thing.
