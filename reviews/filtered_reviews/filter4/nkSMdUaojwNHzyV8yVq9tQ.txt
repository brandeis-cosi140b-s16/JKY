Interesting menu!  Many items feature the Hatch chile, which is a formidable bit of hotness that you can even purchase to take home with you (wear gloves.)  Decor is festive, music is wonderfully authentic and the place is usually jumping with customers around lunchtime and dinnertime.

I had the New Mexico Enchiladas and they rocked my world.  This is a nice blend of authentic and creative approaches to traditional dishes that never get too ritzy or complex.  Margaritas were super and service was superb.  I haven't been brave enough to try a "three hatch" entree' yet (their rating system of peppers skews low - one hatch will fire you up) but that's certainly going to be next!
