I enjoy Paco's Tacos & Tequila when I need to get my Tex Mex fix in Southpark.  I can't get enough of their salsas and chips.  I am also salivatingly into their beef brisket tacos.  They are a must-get.  I had an interesting cocktail called firestarter or firebreather or something.  Its primary ingredient is jalepeno infused tequila.  It was pretty cool.  It astounds me that a drink has been created that is spicy and sour at the same time.  I don't know how good it is for business though because it prompted me to sip slowly.  There was a 30 min or so wait on prime time Sat night, but service was good and price was reasonable.  2 brisket tacos with rice, beans and chipotle slaw for $10!
