Very friendly servers and hostess. Sad that's there's no breakfast after 11:00 am. My shellfish allergy prevents me from eating/rating the chips but my friend said were good. The bean dip and salsa were tasty. She had machaca w:/eggs and house made tortillas- yum! I had a torts with chicken mole, so good. House made bread, good toppings and the mole..... Heavenly. It's so hard to find good mole, this is the best I've tasted in town. Word is they have a good Happy Hour as well- worth checking out.
