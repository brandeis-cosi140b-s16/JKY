Tacos are fantastic but you may have to wait up to an hour! 

This place is right on my way home from work and I often stop here to get food to take home. The price is right but sometimes the wait is verrrryyyy long... The people who work there are always super friendly and it doesn't get more authentic than this. 

I would try to go there when it's not too busy but the asada and abodaba are FANTASTIC!
