The Blackened Chicken Buenos Nachos were very good, and a substantial enough portion for 2 people if you want to get something else off the menu too.  I also liked the blackened fish taco I got.  I'm not too big on spice, and this had a mild kick to it, but not bad at all if you aren't super sensitive to spice like me.  Good food, good prices, and I like the TVs for watching sports when dining in.
