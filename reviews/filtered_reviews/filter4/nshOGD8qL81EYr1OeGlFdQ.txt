My sister had been wanting to come here for awhile. We finally went! I had the fish tacos(I wasn't a vegetarian yet and am not sure how friendly this place might be on that). I thought they were wonderful. A little different from what I was used to, but different isn't always bad. I loved the bean dip, salsa, and chips that was brought to our table while we waited as well. The service was fast and the place smells amazing. The atmosphere was great. There was a musician playing beautiful music, and the decorations covering the walls were interesting too.
