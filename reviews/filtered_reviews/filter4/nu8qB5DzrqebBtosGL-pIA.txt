It's so very very rare, but this airport bar/restaurant actually has decent food and good service.  The menu is limited of course but I have never ordered anything I didn't like. 

It is pricey compared to most of the other food options in the terminal. However! Did you know that all the restaurants in most US airports are all owned by the same company, it allows it to fix the market and keep all the prices high once you pass through TSA.  An absolute crime in my opinion.

This place also has a nice grab and go menu if you're in a rush.  Safe travels!!
