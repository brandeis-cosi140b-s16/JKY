Pretty good grub. The atmosphere is quite festive, the prices are fairly low, I've never had to wait for a table, and the service has always been friendly and attentive. Yes, I am mexican so I know authentic mexican food, and I've even taken my parents here, and my own father who is the king of Chile had a hard time handling the heat from their Hatch chiles. Man those things have some kick to them! if you like spicy, give them a try!
