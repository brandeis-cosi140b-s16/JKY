Well, I asked a random employee in the restaurant "donde esta el ba√±o," and was answered in Spanish, so that's a good sign. We tried the four salsa sampler, and all four were "muy delicioso" and the chips were nicely done as well. I ordered a house margarita which was pretty tasty and came out with a huge extra portion for me to refresh my glass from. Muy bueno. The chicken enchiladas were good, although the meat was a little on the tough side. Still, the sauces were great, and my dinner companions enjoyed their meals as well. Service was friendly and our waitress even anticipated when we'd need more chips and brought them without asking. My only complaint is that the kitchen smoke from cooking occasionally filled the dining area with smoke, so they should really ventilate that a bit more. Overall, a very positive experience - I'll be back.
