Perhaps a little pricey for a taco joint but I did have the best taco I've ever had. Duck confit with an apricot jam with feta cheese. I'm not usaully a huge fan of corn tortillas because the tend to be dry and coarse but they make their own masa there and it is wonderful. Fresh, chewy, and compliments the tacos extremely well. The bartender was a cool dude who made an effort to be entertaining, I appreciate that style in the right setting, cheers to him. The building is way cool as well, it's in an old church, but you don't feel bad pounding tequilla, well played Taco Guild.
