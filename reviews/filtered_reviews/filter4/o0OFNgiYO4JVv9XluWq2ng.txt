After one of my epic party adventures down town... My buddy said this place was a must for great breakfast food. We entered the spot it was packed we were seated pretty fast and I looked over the menu and went with the  Machaca, Chilaquiles y Huevos Combo with a tall Dos Equis it was early but a must have... I rate the experience as followed.

I enjoyed my meal it was so good... I will be back for sure soon for some great food everyone was so nice my second beer ended up on the table talking with your hands can be a problem...The staff laughed and helped me clean it up now that's team work.
