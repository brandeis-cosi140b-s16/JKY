If only the service had been more on point, I definitely would have given the Mission 5 stars. 

The food was fantastic. Every single bite. Drinks were well made too. We had the table side guacamole to start and it was remarkably good. Not sure what they do differently from other places, but it works. I had the Green Chile Duck for my entree and it was one of the best plates of food I've had in a while. It had a sweet, salty, spicy thing going on and was really well balanced. 

The service, while quite friendly, was inexcusably slow. We waited way too long between courses and what should have taken an hour and a half at most, took close to 3. 

The restaurant itself is beautiful and the crowd was sharp and good looking. It was extremely busy - especially for a Monday night, so I would definitely recommend getting a reservation.
