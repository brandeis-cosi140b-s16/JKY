Last night me and my girlfriend were in the mood for a giant juicy burger. We walked into Fat Boy and was instantly blown away by the delicious smell. I got the double cheese boyger w/ bacon and chencho fries. All of our food was at the table less than 10 mins, but that doesn't take from its quality. The burger was 10/10!! We prob said "oh my god" after every bite. The meat/bacon was cooked to perfection. The bun was fantastic as well. I'm a big fan of GOOD ranch dressing, and I was not let down. Dipping the burger/fries into the ranch and drowning it down with Coke was heaven! Only complaint was the chencho fries were "too wet" for our tastes. I have no idea why I took me so long to come here, living 5 minutes away couldn't be better. I will definitely frequent here more often.
