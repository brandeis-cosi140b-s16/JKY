Going to update my review, we go here all the time because it is so close to home and we really don't experience any problems anymore. The atmosphere is fun, it is always pretty busy, and the bartenders and servers are pretty fast and always friendly. The food is average, but it is a great place to go for a drink or two and to people watch.
