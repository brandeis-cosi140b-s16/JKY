Certainly worth the drive off the strip.  The place is huge, the food has always been great and consistent.  They have many dishes to choose from, you can't go wrong...

They make the guacamole right at your table to your liking (love that).

I've sent many coworkers there and I always get positive feedback.  Apparently there are now a few of these restaurants but this is my favorite.  I can't speak for the others since I haven't been to them.
