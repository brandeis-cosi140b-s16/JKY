Visited Border Grill for a breakfast event and was treated to some delicious food to start the day. From I recall I tried Peruvian Shrimp and Grits, Bread Pudding French Toast, and my favorite was the Bacon Jalape√±o PBJ, Nice location inside Mandalay Bay and look forward to coming back again for their Sunday Brunch.
