We found this restaurant on our way out of Phoenix, after commenting how we'd spent the past week in Arizona and hadn't eaten any Mexican food.  I did a quick search on my IPhone and this place was the closest.  It was about a 45 minute wait when we got there at 6:30 on Friday night.  We had a house margarita while waiting, possibly one of the worst I've ever had, but then we were given another one for free, which I did drink so it wasn't undrinkable.  They give each table bread with a red pepper and olive tapenade, which I thought was amazing.  We had their guacamole--they make it table side and add pomegranate seeds, it was really good.    I had the slow roasted pork, the portion was really large and incredibly delicious.  My boyfriend had their seafood relleno, also really good especially if you like creamy seafood.
