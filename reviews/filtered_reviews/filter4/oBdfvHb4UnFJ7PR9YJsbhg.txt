I ate at this place a few times a few years ago, and this dish was/is memorable:

Chuletas Con Chile Rojo ~ Just like Nana used to make...two pork chops grilled then simmered in a spicy red chile sauce. Served with rice, whole beans, warm flour tortillas, and green chile salsa on the side. $12.50

I had that every time, and it ROX.  Always enough to take home some after getting full.  Worth the trip.

Salsa and chips were good too.
