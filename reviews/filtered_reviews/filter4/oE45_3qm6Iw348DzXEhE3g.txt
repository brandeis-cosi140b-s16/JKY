This place has a great happy hour that lasts till 7:30! Great drink specials and half off of appetizers. I had two drinks and the guacamole,  which was perfect. My server was prompt and attentive even though it was packed in there. I wish there was more patio seating for the bar area. The patio seating for the restaurant was empty but you cant get the bar specials if you sit there.
