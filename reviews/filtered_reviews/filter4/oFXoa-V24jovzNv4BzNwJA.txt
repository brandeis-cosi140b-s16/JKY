Food is serviceable to good (love their chips and salsa, beans taste like they're made from scratch and not out of a can, garnishes freshly cut)...  Service and atmosphere are great though and keep me coming back..  The weekday bartender is really friendly and I like having a couple of drinks with lunch at the bar.  I'm sure there's more authentic Mexican food out there but this place is really good for what it is.
