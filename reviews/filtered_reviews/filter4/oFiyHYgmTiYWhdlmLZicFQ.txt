Went here tonight with my wife. The  d√©cor is cool, the service is first rate and the tacos are delicious. The street food size portions are fine, but the guys might wish the tacos were a little bit larger. The taste is excellent. They have chips and a really nice salsa waiting for you when you get to your table. Nice idea. I had the shrimp taco and the carne asada taco and the crispy fish taco. All of them were great. I liked the crispy fish the best. My wife loved the margaritas. Our waiter Justin did an outstanding job. The wait staff, are everywhere and they didn't miss a beat when we were there.   Make the tacos a little bit bigger and this place is a definite 5 star all day long. We will definitely be back.
