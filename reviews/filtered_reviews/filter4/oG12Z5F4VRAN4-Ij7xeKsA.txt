Already my fourth, or is it fifth, visit here... And for good reason! The tacos are great :) Even after this many visits, I still haven't had a chance to try them all... Or all of the margaritas... I keep re-ordering favorites from the last time ;) 

Some of those include the carnitas, braised beef, crispy fish, and Baha fish tacos... Do yourself a favor and order three just to get the free side of black beans or roasted vegetables tossed in the guajillo pepita salsa. One trick I plan to try next trip is to order them one or two at a time to ensure they are hot when I'm ready to much 'em down as I discovered after the first two, I needed a slight breather. That gave the Baja taco too much time to cool off. It was still delicious but would have been even better right off the grill.

All the toppings are fresh and crisp and will vary by the taco, but come in deliciously hand made corn tortillas instead of the mass produced machined ones you'll find elsewhere. 

Add some guacamole or ceviche as a starter and you'll have PLENTY to feed you AND a friend... 

Just like other Upward Projects restaurants, they do Happy Hour all day until 5pm with $5 pitchers, coctails, and wine... Quite the deal :) And just like the other locations, they've done a great job with their employees. They are all VERY well versed in their products, preparations, and customer service skills... You will feel very well taken care of.

My advice... Wear your stretchy pants ;)
