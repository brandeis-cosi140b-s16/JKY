Just had the Huevos Rancheros for breakfast. Having grown up in Albuquerque, I'm always excited to try a new New Mexican restaurant. If you're from New Mexico you know how awesome it is to find a new place that serves Hatch chiile. The New Mexican Cafe did not disappoint. The Huevos plate was just like what I used to having back in New Mexico. The place is very clean and you can't beat the price.
