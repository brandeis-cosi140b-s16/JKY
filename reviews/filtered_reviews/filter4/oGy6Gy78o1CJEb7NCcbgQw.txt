As a self-proclaimed Mexican food addict, te quiero Las Velas! Yum! Yum! Yum!  Las Velas had been at the top of my "To Try" list for what seemed like eons, and I am happy to say I can finally check it off.  Not only was the food absolutely amazing, but the views of Market Square were fabulous as well.

What I really liked about this place was the selection.  Everything from traditional Mexican dishes to having your tacos made "Tex-Mex" style, allowing everyone in my party to eat within their own Mexican food comfort zone.  I ordered carnitas tacos. (Because I can't see carnitas on a menu and not order it.  It's just an impulse I have to live with.) They were everything I hoped and dreamed. Literally, I dream about these tacos. The pork was juicy and covered with fresh cilantro and lime, with just a hint of garlic  Ah, so good. 

The only draw back I can find with Las Velas is that the chips and salsa aren't free. Now, I grew up on the West Coast where paying for chips is almost unheard of, however I have noticed charging for these addicting crispy wonders is trend among Pittsburgh's Mexican restaurants. This is really a small complaint in my otherwise fantabulous first experience at Las Velas.  I will definitely be back to explore more of their great menu, chips or no chips!
