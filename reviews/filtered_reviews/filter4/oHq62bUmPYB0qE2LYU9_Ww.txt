Came here on a Saturday for lunch. We sat right away on the patio (we brought our 2 dogs). Service was great, tacos/beans/rice/salsa were all delicious.

Only slight disappointment was the ice cream cookie sandwich they offer for desert. They don't make them there but they look a lot better on the menu than they tasted.

Would recommend for the tacos !
