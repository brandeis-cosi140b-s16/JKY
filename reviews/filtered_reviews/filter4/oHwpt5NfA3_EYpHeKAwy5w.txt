Only been on Sunday afternoons, always a small wait but it goes by fast. 

Micheladas are bomb and made in house with their own recipe.

Camarron de las huicha is a favorite, large and filling. Looks smaller then what's inside the goblet.

Mochajete is big with lots of protein and shrimp. Very filling and worth the cost.

Service is great and everyone is attentive.

To get seated fast, keep bugging the guy at the front that too your name and party amount, he seems to get you in faster since you are attentive to getting seated
