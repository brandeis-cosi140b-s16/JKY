I have been going to this restaurant for at least 20 years now.  I love the decor, so do the out of town visitors, and it is very clean.  I love the salsas, hot and mild, as well as their chips.  We have ordered the bean dip for appetizer and it was very flavorful.  My favorites here are the green chili (burro or other) and chili relleno.  For lunch, the prices are great and the orders come out very quickly. The only complaint is that sometimes they don't have bussers on staff to refill your drinks so you might be left thirsty.  Other than that, it's a great hangout.
