Our family loves eating here!  Great chips, salsa, pollo fundido is to die for, and awesome fajitas.  The only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars is the inconsistent service.  Most times it is great, and the food always comes out fast, but when you get a slow server it is going to be really bad. I can excuse it when the place is busy or when someone tells us they are new, but lazy doesnt deserve a 20% tip, and when we have complained about the service we seem to get a brush off from managers. BUT, 90% of the time it is a good experience.
