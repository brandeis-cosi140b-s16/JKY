Yum!  I think the ordering process is a little confusing at first, but once you've been there, it's easy.

I'm a HUGE nacho person; theirs are just okay.  I felt like they didn't have enough cheese, and the cheese that was on there was hardly melted. 

BUT, the tacos are great!  I love the carnitas, but my favorite were the vampiro!  I had never had one before, but it was outstanding!  The cheese was caramelized and crispy.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  This is across town for me, so we won't go often, but when a taco craving strikes, for sure!
