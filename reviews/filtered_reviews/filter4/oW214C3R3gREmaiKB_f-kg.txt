I have to admit, I was really schechy about this place because it is a Mexican and Chinese food fusion and I happend to be Chinese.  I also saw this on the food network on Chowdown countdown.  For some reason I wanted to try this place to see how bad it was and for some reason it is not bad at all.  At first when you walk into this place you see a white server and a bunch of hispanics cooking the food and you are like where are the Asians.  But I have to admit the service was really great. The girl served me plenty of samples to try.

I had the jade chicken, burrito machato, black beans, chicken fried rice and it was not bad.  They do give you plenty of food for the price, but the ordering is confusing.  I remember the girl was nice enough to fill in the order form for me.  

As for the food, it was not greasy at all and did not give me a stomach ache which is a good thing.  Also, I did see an Asian person eat there too.  Oh I loved the cookie as well.  Something that does not go well with Chinese and Mexican food, but okay. Anyways it was not bad and I probably go back and eat there.
