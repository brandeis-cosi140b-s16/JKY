I'm still trying to figure out what people are complaining about, but we had a pretty good experience.  It took us a minute to find the place, because it was jazz night so we figured it was down by the lake, but it ended up being closer to the casino.  

I'll second everyone's comments on the chips and salsa.  Pretty good.  Lots of garlic in the salsa, so you know I'm all over it.

Drinks kept us cool for the warm weather.  Summer beer, mojitos, and ice blended margarita, all made by Omar and all super good.  First time I've had a summer beer and I think that's gonna be my drink of choice next time I'm getting hammered outdoors.

Food-wise, we ordered Avocado Rolls, Ceviche De Mariscos, and Camarones al Mojo de Ajo all recommended by our server Steve.  Everything was pretty damn good.  I don't know if it's because we had low expectations for this place based on reviews, but everything was pretty bomb.  I thought the avocado rolls would be similar to BJ's version, but it was way different.  Pretty good though.  The ceviche was fresh and just overall good flavor.  The Camarones al Mojo de Ajo was really good too.  Lots of flavor and went well with the steamed rice.  Some veggies would have been nice, but still damn good.

If you're in a hurry, don't expect super fast service.  I think the whole point of this place is to enjoy the large portions and each other's company, so the food doesn't come out that fast, but definitely worth the wait.  

They also had some guy singing for entertainment.  I guess they have a singer on certain nights of the week.  He was killin' it though.  He had some good choices.  Plus any guy that sings Bobby Brown is a winner in my book.
