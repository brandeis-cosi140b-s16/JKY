A bit drizzly on Thurs. when we ended up here it was a bit before 3 the place was empty maybe 2 other customers while we were there. We were greeted by a nice lady who asked how many I replied 2 1/2 in Spanish she replied in to sit where we pleased. I wish it would have been nice out that day their patio looked like fun....maybe another day for happy hour yeah. My daughter loved the fish tank I just hope the catfish wasn't for eating later!! Yikes it was way too big for the tank and looked a bit out of place with the other goldfish.

Hot chips and 2 carafes of salsa came out w our waiter one hot and one not. YAY just how I like it!! I liked to mix them here to get the perfect amount of heat I like it was yummy the chips could have been a tad better some were a little too toasted. I had a chile relleno lunch their beans and rice were great no complaints the egg on the relleno was a little too peppery for me but I dont like pepper too much yet I still cleaned my plate. My mom had an enchilada she ate it up quick and the kid's plate was so cute w a mini taco my daughter liked that she could put the not hot salsa in the taco and eat it! =) Quick and very pleasant service. Could use a little dusting pics coming soon.
