My husband and I had dinner here the other night and were pleasantly pleased.  The food is great!  The margaritas were very tasty and they didn't skimp on the kick.  The chips were fresh and the salsa had just enough spice.  The guacamole was a little bland for my taste but if you don't like heat you will like it.  We had the guacamole appetizer and shared the chile verde entree with the borracha beans.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was that the food was so good partly because it was not even close to low in fat and my old gut just didn't handle the richness of the food as well as it would have a few years back (maybe a little more than a few years).  I would still go back because it was so very good, almost sinful.
