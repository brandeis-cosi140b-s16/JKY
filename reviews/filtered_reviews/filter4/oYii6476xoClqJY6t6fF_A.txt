Closed on Monday. ... However I did get to stop in on Tuesday. I am glad that I did, the green chile burrito is made of a fresh flour tortilla that is made in house.  The chips and salsa that came with it were top notch, crisp and warm.  I also had the chile relleno which was very good and had a nice salsa topping.  Fellow Yelpers are spot on and I am glad that I tried out this local fav.  Finding places like this are exactly why I love Yelp.  I cannot wait to come back and try other items, like the Goat Soup.
