Went here for dinner last night with a few ladies and was surprised by the diverse selection the menu provided. 

However, being that I was adventureous in even trying a new place,  I settled on chicken enchiladas for dinner with their white queso. I questioned going to this place altogether due to it's unfamiliar location, and while initially questioning my sanity/safety, i have determined their food is DEFINITELY worth dying for :)

One of the ladies i was with raved about their food prior to us arriving, so my expectations were set pretty high. She also mentioned they had good margaritas, and to my pleasant surprise she was right! And, um...hello $2.99!! Their chips were good, their salsa was lacking flavor/spice (IMO), but their white queso was phenom! Perfect amount of flavor and spice. And yes, notice i said WHITE queso. Saw someone else mention they only use yellow cheese. Last i checked, i wasn't color blind. Forgive me, I digress.

The other ladies ordered a bowl of the green chili, and a burro. Didn't try the burro, but it looked/smelled great and the green chili was also a success. To finish things off, we had their fried ice cream with half honey & half strawberry. WOW! First time i've had it, and i'll definitely be going back if only for their $2.99 margaritas and fried ice cream. It really is the small things in life that make us women happy :)

The staff was entertaining, attentive, and polite. My only complaint about my whole experience was that on the menu the enchilada I ordered indicated shredded chicken, and it wasn't. It was chunked/cubed, and in turn made it very "chickeny" (it was STUFFED with Chicken) In addition, it was ALL dark meat. I prefer white meat over anything, but I suppose "to each their own". I think i'll just try a beef or cheese lada next time.

All in all, very good experience, and at the top of my list for best Mexican in the valley!
