The best Chipotle is located on Detroit Road in Lakewood, OH. Sorry, I know it's a drive, but it's the truth. However, right now this is the closest Chipotle to my place so I'll review it. But this review is for Chipotle as a chain, not this particular location. If I were to review a specific location, I would review the one in Lakewood, OH because it is the best one.

Chipotle is really really good. I love the burrito assembly line. I love that they aren't stingy with...anything. At least with me they aren't. I think they may pick up on the subtle "BITCH I WILL CUT YOU" look in my eye if they even hint at putting the spoon down after only one scoop of chicken.  Either way, it's awesome.

It's in that weird "fast food atmosphere without fast food pricing" quadrant of the restaurant world, which I normally don't like but with Chipotle it's acceptable because you are getting a burrito the size of a baby for about $7.  

Woulda given it 5 stars, but the one in Lakewood, OH is better.
