My first time visiting and am glad I stopped by. We had their Brussels sprout Nachos which are so great!  They have a handful of sauces to choose from for your tacos. We tried their shrimp and cod tacos both very flavorful. Their coconut rice was delish. The churro and soft serve ice cream were on point and their service was great.  I want to return maybe for their happy hour so I can get a taste of all their different tacos and have a coconut drink or ceviche, idk but am certain I will return very soon!
