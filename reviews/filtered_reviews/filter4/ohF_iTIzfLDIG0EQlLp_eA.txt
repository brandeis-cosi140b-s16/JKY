Mexican-Chinese fusion, really?! - that was definitely my first thought when entering Jose Andres' Vegas restaurant. I mean how could beans and rice mesh well with Peking Duck? The answer is that it can go quite well together.

Two dishes were particularly amazing. 

Beijing Glass: a chinese noodle dish accompanied by Mexican vegetables such as jicama and avocado. The sauce soaked into the glass noodles making the whole dish an amazing melange of flavors! Plus, the portion was large and easy to share among several friends.

Silencio: a sweet barbecue taco composed of duck tongues. Andres has always been one to test his diner's culinary limits (just check out my entry for his DC restaurant) and at first eating a bunch of little tongues can be unnerving. But after a few bites, you will not be able to put down this dose of deliciousness.

Other dishes were less memorable; however, they were all good. My biggest complaint were the prices. With the exception of Beijing Glass, portions were a little small for sharing. You had to order more which raised the price a bit high!
