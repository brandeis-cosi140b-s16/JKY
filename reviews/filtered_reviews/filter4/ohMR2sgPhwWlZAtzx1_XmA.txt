I have to admit, when Montford Drive was getting trendy, I was becoming less and less interested.  Mostly because of the pain it was to get over there and then the extra pain it was to find parking etc.  I must be getting older, but just having to deal with that doesn't really strike my fancy, but I digress.

Came here in a whim (mostly because Sir Edmond Halley's didn't open until 5pm on Sundays).  But no expectations and a hungry stomach.  I was pleasantly surprised.

The place was not crowded at all since it was 3pm on a Sunday.  There were some folks enjoying the weather on the nice patio they have here (fake turf and colorful lawn chairs made it look like those folks were having a grand time).

We were seated right away, and I could tell our hostess/server was the only one working (luckily we weren't in a terrible rush).  I got $5 bloody mary drink special and waited for our friend to arrive.  Chips and salsa were brought out right away so we had plenty to much on.  

After our friend arrived, we tried to put in our order, but our server was so busy at this point.  There was a good little while before she came back to our table.  The manager came by and we asked to put our order in and she sent someone else (food runner) to take our order while  our server caught up.  No biggie.

I had the Jalapeno Mahi Mahi tacos and cilantro lime fries.  I was starving by the time the food came so I inhaled it in 30seconds... It was pretty tasty and satisfying.  I'll definitely come back to try the other tacos on the menu - they looked pretty interesting.
