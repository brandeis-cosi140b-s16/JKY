I decided to give this place a 2nd chance when I saw a groupon for half off. We found a picnic table right by a game of cornhole. Had a few drinks, played a few games, and hung out with our dogs. Our server was friendly and even brought a take out container with water for the pups.
We have been back a couple of times since, and always have a fun time. The atmosphere is like no other. I really liked the prickly pear margarita, even at $8 and in a plastic cup :P
