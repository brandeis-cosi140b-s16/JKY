America's - still very happy with you. I wanted to write an update, because I think your breakfast burrito's are great. 

However, I have a recommendation.  Every place that I go for breakfast in Texas has Breakfast Tacos. Tortilla; chorizo/carne asada; eggs, chile. Given that you now own the rights as being one of the best taco shops in Arizona, would you consider adding breakfast taco's to your menu? think about it- your lovely carne asada; some eggs; etc. I'm just thinking of options to add to your breakfast menu. You can thank me later.
