Delicious complimentary salsa. Got the dip trio and the bean dip was the star of the show. I had the Taos combo with green sauce (chile relleno, tamale and enchilada) and it was amazing. I always love Mexican rice, but theirs was to die for! Will definitely try Blue Adobe for breakfast next time around.
