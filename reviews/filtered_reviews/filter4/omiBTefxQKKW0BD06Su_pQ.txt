Casa Reyna has some of the better authentic Mexican food I have had in my 7 years living in Pittsburgh. I had steak tacos and they were slightly bland but when I added a bit of salt, it really brought out the flavors. We also tried the guacamole, which is prepared table side, it was great as was the salsa sampler. The heat in the habanero salsa wasnt overbearing and it had a great taste to it. My only real complaint is the entrance is sort of confusing. There isnt any signage and if I wouldnt have read previous reviews about the restaurant being downstairs, I probably would have had no idea. All in all though, the food was great and Ill probably be back in the future.
