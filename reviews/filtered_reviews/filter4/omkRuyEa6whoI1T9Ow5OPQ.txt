I heart food.  I especially heart tacos.  These ain't your mama's tacos. (unless your mom was a gourmet chef...my mom used a packet of El Paso, ground beef, and shells...not creative, though it brings back good memories...but that's a different review.)

Yo Ritas has a stable of "go to" tacos that change from time to time, plus a special that can sometimes be "oddball." (Follow them on Twitter for the updates...think foie, fried chicken livers, etc.)  They also have a daily ceviche, if that's your thing (and it should be.) 

We started with coconut mojitos, which I verified pre-order that they weren't *too* girly, as well as 6 tacos, and grits.  Do yourself a favor, and get the grits.  The grits are amazing.  They were more like risotto without rice.  Seriously, I'll go back just for that. Best.Grits.Ever.

As for tacos...I really liked the roasted corn, pulled pork, and chorizo.  The chorizo wasn't what I expected...think breakfast in a taco.  the tuna was a generous portion, but unfortunately was too overpowered by raw onion. Eggplant was meh, and calamari was good...but not mind-blowing. 

Don't order more than 3 tacos.  They're not huge, but they're not small, either (flour tortillas.)
