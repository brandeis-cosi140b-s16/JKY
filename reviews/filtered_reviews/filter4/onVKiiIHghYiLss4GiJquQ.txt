I used to go to the old mexican place that was in this location... I'm really pleased with the changes they made! My mini-tostadas were great, and my friend's tacos were delish, too! We sat at the bar, and had wonderful service. The waiter was prompt, friendly, and funny. He filled us in on the varying portion sizes, and recommended great dishes. 

Great selection of tequila at the bar, but we were happy to get Bohemias. ;)

Its a really convenient location (atrium level in the Luxor), and reasonable prices for Vegas. 

Give it a go!
