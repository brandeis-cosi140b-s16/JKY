I've been meaning to check out Gallo Blanco for a long time now, I'm sad it took me so long to finally do it. The atmosphere is relaxed and inviting with an artsy and youthful vibe. The staff were all courteous and friendly. My friend and I ordered the guacamole to start, there was plenty to share and was it very tasty. I had the carne asada burrito, which was quite large and very good. Everything tasted fresh and it wasn't very "heavy" for a carne asada burrito. My friend had the breakfast burrito and he loved it. I think he summed it up best saying, "Seriously, if you want to come back tomorrow morning for breakfast, call me."

We'll both be back, definitely!
