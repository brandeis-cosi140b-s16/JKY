Hussong's is located in The Shoppes at Mandalay Place (aka the walkway between Luxor and Mandalay Bay's casino. The have a hostess podium in the walkway, and we were quickly seated.

I liked the tortilla chips, they where different, much thicker, much like you may get at a Mexican restaurant when they serve you queso and it comes with thicker chips. The waitress was great, and very attentive. Probably the second best service I had the entire time I was in LV.

The food had a good bit of flavor cooked in, not the standard poured on after microwaving flavor you find at a lot of places. The portions were a bit on the smaller side for the price, but the quality was there. I cannot comment on the bar or drinks, but everyone seemed to be enjoying the huge margaritas. 

I would not hesitate to stop by again on my next trip.
