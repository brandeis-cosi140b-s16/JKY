Came here again with the whole family (6of us) after a first successful evening. Once again, the service was remarkable and the owner very friendly. The food we ordered was the whole red snapper, the fish tray, and the sistes martes ( I know I spelled that wrong but it was the soup of the seven seas). I have it 4 stars again because of this. 

I got the whole fish because I thought it would be basically 2x the size of the fillet. It was definitely not, and it was a little too cooked / breaded so there was hardly any meat and way too much work. The taste still was great, but I will definitely opt for the filet next time. The seafood platter was very impressive. Everything's was cooked absolutely to perfection. The only downside was that it was pretty salty on some pieces. The red fish ( I have no idea  what it was called but it was straight out red) was my favorite because it was cooked so amazingly. It's not easy to deep fry such a small piece of fish and have it come out perfectly! Because it is all fried,  I would not recommend getting just that because I personally would get sick of it, but since we all also shared the fish (tacos) and soup, the meal was very balanced. Moving on to the soup, it was pretty good. It was cool to see snails in it as they are hard to find in AZ. It was full of different seafood which my family really enjoyed, but the broth was a bit bland. I was expecting a bouillabaisse tasting broth but it was a slightly fishy chicken broth. I'm not sure we would get that again but it's definitely a mellow flavor if you like that. Overall even though the food should have served 4 people, the 6 of us were exploding and had to work hard to finish everything. And the prices (I think $60) was so totally worth it! I mean it's hard to find such fresh seafood in AZ, but Baja joes nails it and the prices are reasonable and the portions are massive. We will definitely make this one of our regulars.
