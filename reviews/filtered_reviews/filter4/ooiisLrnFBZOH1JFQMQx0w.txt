Yayo lacks a bit of consistency, but when it's good, it's GOOD.  This is a very laid back place, reminiscent of a chilled out beach bar that would be better suited for a Southern California beach rather than the Nevada desert, but I'm sure glad it's here.  Even without the amazing UNLV special (4 tacos, 2 sides, and a soda for $5), this place would still be one of my favorite off-strip lunch spots.  

The service can sometimes be slow, but the staff is always very friendly, and it seems the lack of urgency is just part of the laid back attitude of the restaurent; that being said, the food is definitely worth the wait.  This place is first and foremost, a taqueria, with a number of great specialty tacos that are garnished with some incredible sauces and garnishes.  It feels strange calling this place a gourmet taco place since everything is so cheap, but that really is the best way to describe it.  This place also has a HUGE selection of specialty and craft beers, and an seemingly unlimited selection of taquilas.  

If you're a UNLV student, a Vegas local, or just want to venture a bit off the strip for a great lunch, check this place out.
