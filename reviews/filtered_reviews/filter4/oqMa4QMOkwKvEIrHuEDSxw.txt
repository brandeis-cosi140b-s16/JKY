Can be hard to find,  but worth it.  At the far end of the Costco parking lot,  prior to Costco.  Order the guacamole.

Great ambiance.. As nice as the most expensive Mexican restaurant.  The fajitas for two was a generous portion DELICIOUS.  About $20 each.

Went back again, and enjoyed it again. We shared a burrito and the 3 tacos and, of course, the guacamole and chips. It was a filling and delicious lunch.
