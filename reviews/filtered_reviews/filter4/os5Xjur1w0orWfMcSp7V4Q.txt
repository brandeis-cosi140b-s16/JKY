My husband and I like this place a lot.  I'm from San Diego, so it's hard to compare Mexican food (nothing compares to SD taco shop food, sorry!).  Service is always good here (we always sit at the bar) and the food is consistent.  I prefer thinner chips, which is why I didn't give 5 stars.  The chips here are super thick and need more salt, but other than that, we like it!
