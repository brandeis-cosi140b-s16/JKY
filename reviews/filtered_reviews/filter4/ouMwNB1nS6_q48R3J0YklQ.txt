Found this place through yelp and via a promotion for a free margarita cocktail. The cocktails were very nice (voted best in Vegas) and the food was also delicious. The complementary nachos were good and the food was also good. The service was very good with the staff always checking your experience was good. Would recommend to anyone in Vegas.
