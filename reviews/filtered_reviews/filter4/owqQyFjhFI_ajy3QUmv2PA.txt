Finally made to to Barrio Cafe last night... really enjoyed it! 

Our waiter was fun and exuberant and the place had a cozy atmosphere with great live music. 

The food was excellent - we had great margaritas and tableside guacamole. Their braised pulled pork is delicious! My boyfriend had their special which was filet and lobster tail. Our dishes came with squash and mashed potatoes (chipotle-flavored, I think). All the sauces were oh-so-good. 

Definitely will go back!
