Was at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center and instead of eating at the food court, I wanted something a bit better.  Border Grill is actually in between the convention center and the casino so decided to check out Vegas's location.

The place was pretty packed, thanks to the convention crowds.  Originally I wanted to grab a seat at the bar since I was by myself, but Vegas was storming, so the end of the bar was actually wet from water leaking from the roof!  Mandalay Bay definitely was showing its age... but I was able to grab a small table at the bar area without waiting thanks to one of the really friendly waitress!

I've been the LA's Border Grill a few times, but only for happy hour so I was pretty excited to check out the regular menu.  Asked the waiter what his favorite was and went with the Carne Asada Quesedilla.  It's essentially their carne asada, with several types of cheeses.  It's not the best carne asada I've had, but the beef was good.  Quality's good and I like how the tortilla is crunchy.  I wish it was cheesier but the pico de gallo and the guac goes very well with the quesedilla!  If you want to add rice & beans, it's an additional $4 on top of the $18 for the quesedilla.  A little pricey for quesedilla, but the quality's good.

Food alone, it probably was a little average, but the service was great, from the waitress that helped me at the beginning, to my server.

They definitely need to fix the leaking problem though :P
