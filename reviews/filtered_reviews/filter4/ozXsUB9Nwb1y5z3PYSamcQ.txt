The staff was very friendly and brought us whatever we needed right away. They even brought a complimentary soup for our baby to eat - which he liked! My husband and I both ordered a combo meal. Both of them came with plenty of food! My cheese enchilada was tasty with not too much cheese and the red sauce was great! My beef taco was a bit bland, but this has been my experience with most all Mexican places. The complimentary salsa, chips, and bean dip were good as well. We would eat here again!
