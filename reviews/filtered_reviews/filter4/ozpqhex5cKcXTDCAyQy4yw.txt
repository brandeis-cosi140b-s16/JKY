Food was yummy!!  Started with chips and salsa, guacamole, and queso.  All were very good.  
The cornbread is super tasty too.  Got filled up too fast, but the chicken mac n cheese was so good, I ate half of it.... And I was full before it came out.  Service was terrific.  Food was delicious.  Restaurant is clean and comfy.  Not a very vast dessert menu, but chances are you wont have room.  We didn't. :)
