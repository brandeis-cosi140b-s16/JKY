Had some incredible seafood enchiladas here. Salmon and shrimp with veggies in tortillas with some kind of awesome rich sauce. I swapped the rice for grilled veggies. Probably loaded with oil in the marinade but it was mighty tasty! Cornbread was pretty good too. And it's not too expensive to go on a weeknight... I think I spent around $20 with a glass or two of wine.
