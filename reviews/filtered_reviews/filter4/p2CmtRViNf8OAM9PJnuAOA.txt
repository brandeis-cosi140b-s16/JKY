After I got over the first impression, I loved it. It looks like more of a sports bar and the salsa left a lot to be desired, but when the food came I was impressed. The chili relleno was the best I've ever had, and the fish tacos were interesting in a good way. The "chili" rating on the menu is accurate - they are spicier than expected.
