I really like Fiesta Burrito. When my Husband suggested we go here, I was a little nervous because it looks a little bit sketchy. When we went inside, it was pretty clean. The staff was really nice and accommodating when I ordered at the window, asking for no cheese and this and that.
I got a Bean Tostada and Bean Taco.

Everything is made fresh, and tastes that way. I really enjoyed the Rice as well. 
Their Pico is really onion heavy, but it balances well with the food. I also like their Green Salsa. 
I will say, I'm not sure if their beans or rice are vegetarian. I'm sort of "if I don't have to chew it, I don't know it is there" vegetarian, so enter with caution if you aren't this way.

The meal really didn't feel greasy or too guilty, even though I'm sure it was!
