I went to Cantina Laredo one evening after work with a large group (there were nine of us) and had a really good experience!

The food: Not super authentic Mexican by any means but they offer an edited menu that's executed well (in other words, small menu but everything on there is pretty good). The complimentary chips and salsa were replenished frequently - I probably ate like three bowls of chips (they were FREE!). I'm a vegan so I ordered the Tacos de Hongos (mushroom tacos). The balsamic glaze was tasty, there was no cheese on my plate and it was a good portion size. 

The service: They were BUSY and thanks to a co-worker having a reservation, we scored a large table in the back. The section we were in had sliding doors so it was obvious they gave us the space they typically use for private dining events. I don't remember her name but our waitress was good - accomodated our requests and offered suggestions. She recommended the mango margarita and it was AWESOME. 

Overall, I'm looking forward to coming back for Happy Hour so I can munch on some chips and have a few more mango margaritas!
