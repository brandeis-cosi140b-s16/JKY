Great novelty restaurant, as seen on TV!

The machaca and jerk chicken were pretty good, but the jerk fried rice had some very hard crunchy bits inside, maybe old fried rice nuggets?

The place is pretty big and very quiet on a weeknight. Very kid friendly. In fact, kids get free rice and gravy plus free drinks. A cheapskate delight!

The great wall of chino was unforgettable, and the staff very friendly and helpful.
