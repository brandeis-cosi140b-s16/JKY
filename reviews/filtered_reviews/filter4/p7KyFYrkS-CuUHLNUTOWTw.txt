Such a fun place!  We went here for the first time today and were pleasantly surprised.  The whole multiple line thing is sort of daunting but the bartender picked up on our confusion and invited us to sit at the bar and she explained everything and took our orders so we did not need to do the line.  

The food was fresh and delicious.  I had tacos - carnitas and barbacoa- both very tasty.  My husband had carne asada burrito which he said was very good and he really liked the grilled tortilla...nice touch.

The bartender (I forgot to ask her name...she was super nice and helpful) brought us a sample of the el pastor and oh my goodness I can't wait to go back and have that!
