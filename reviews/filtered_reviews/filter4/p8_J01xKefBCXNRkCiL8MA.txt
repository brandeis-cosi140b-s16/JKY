Very good tacos would be a good way to start this review. They have alot of them in all forms available and whatever protein you can think of also. They also have American food like burgers, but this is a Mexican joint right? Came here before the ASU game and the bar was pretty full, it's a long ass bar for sure. Post happy hour, but Bud light was just $3 bottle and the chips were free (unlimited) and the salsa was very fresh, bursting with jalapeno's and finely chopped tomatoes (a real salsa). The tacos that caught my attention were the award winning crispy tacos that comes with two sides for $11. A bit pricey, but the tacos were loaded with shredded beef, slices of avocado, mexican cheese and other condiments and the crispy shells were super crispy and had a great crunch. The side dishes were good too, pretty good Mexican rice and something called Smashed Potatoes, which were two giant chunks of crunchy taters that could be smashed I guess with your own fork. Either way, it worked with the white dipping sauce (version of ranch?).
   The only problem with two tacos for $11 is that on the way out I saw  a flyer for $2 taco tuesday which is way cheaper than my dinner, but i doubt they use the crispy shell on those guys. Still sounds like a great deal.
