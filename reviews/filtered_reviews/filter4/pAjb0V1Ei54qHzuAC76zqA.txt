Food
There are a variety of mexican selections from nachos, tacos, and burritos etc. I decided to try the Carne Asada Burrito which came in a huge portion with rice, beans (substitute with veggies) and guacamole. The burrito was very filling for the price, if you don't eat too much, two people could have shared the burrito. We ended up with a lot of to go.

Prices
The Burritos were all about $12.95. In my opinion, it was a little bit pricey for a casual lunch.

Service
The service was great. They also have complementary chips and salsa for us which was great for us when we were talking and waiting for the food to arrive.

Overall
The food was good and met my expectation. The price was a little bit pricey so unless you want to spend $10+ for a burrito, might want to consider ordering something else or sharing with a friend. Otherwise highly recommend for some tasty mexican food when you want to avoid the fast food places like Cafe Rio and Chipotle.
