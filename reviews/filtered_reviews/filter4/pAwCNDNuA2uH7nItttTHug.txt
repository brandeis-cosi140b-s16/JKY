When you walk to the door at Dick's Hideaway you're immediately greeted by the aroma of slow roasting pork wafting through the air. My mouth was watering before even being seated. This place is small and seating is limited, almost cramped...but I was happy that we were seated so quickly, given it was a busy Friday night. If you're lucky enough to have a seat at the bar you can watch all the action take place live.. However, if your a party of two, be forewarned that you could be seated at a very small table where both guests are literally staring at a wall.

Fortunately, the cramped seating and odd view are quickly forgotten when the food arrives. Both dishes were succulent and moist, not to mention full flavor. The server was friendly and was quick to bring over a couple of wine samples before having to make a final decision.

Another Yelper commented on the cold temperature within the restaurant. Granted it was about 113Â° on the day of our visit, but if there was air conditioning on in the restaurant I couldn't feel it. All in all, Dick's Hideaway is a terrific local gem. I'd like to go back and try their brunch at some point.
