We came in at about 8:45 on a Friday night and could see a bunch of empty tables as we walked in, so we were kind of shocked when the hostess told us it would be a 45 minute wait, but that we could wait in the bar.  Well, the bar was super crowded and I didn't feel like wading through the crowd, so we decided to just wait it out on the bench at the front entrance.  To our pleasant surprise, we were shown to our table after waiting only 10 minutes.  Was the 45-minute quoted wait time just a ploy to get us to spend money in the bar?  That was the only part of the experience that put a bad taste in my mouth.

The complimentary chips and salsa were quite good; I just had to add a tiny bit of salt to the chips.  They had a great selection of margaritas ranging in price from about $10 to $25.  For dinner, I had the taco/enchilada combo plate.  It was enough food that I felt satisfied, but not overly stuffed.  The refried beans were on the runny side, but still tasty.  The rice had tiny bits of green pepper in it - not really my thing, but may be of interest to someone else.  My husband had the carne asada burrito; I had a small bite and found the meat to be nicely marinated and perfectly cooked.  The waitress couldn't have been sweeter or more helpful in answering questions about the menu.  We'll definitely be back and maybe next time we'll try the fried ice cream dessert.
