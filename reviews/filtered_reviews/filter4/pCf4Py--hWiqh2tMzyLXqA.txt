If you need a mini vacation, the colorful and expansive references to Baja California are appreciated.  C.F.T. is a great spot for lunch, especially on a sunny day, no matter how cold it is outside.  Not much of a seafood person, I got the tacos and was able to get both steak and chicken at the waitress' recommendation.  The chicken is nicely spicy. The steak was a little under-salted but high quality beef and cooked tender.  Service was impeccable and friendly.  She even threw in a few "hey dudes" for good measure.

The house corn salsa is chunky and fun.  I wasn't wild about the tomatillo salsa because it had too many onions.  I went for the cactus salad as my side for the tacos and wasn't crazy about it either.  Next time I'll just get the black beans and rice which reprises the fresh corn and has no onions.

I didn't realize the tacos are served on a bed of cabbage so next time I'll ask for them to skip that part.  And I'm glad I asked for the cream based sauce on the side. But everything still had a lot of flavor even after a picky eater like me takes it apart.

Next time I'll order a margarita from their specialty drink menu since they offer my beloved Herradura amidst their impressive tequila selection!
