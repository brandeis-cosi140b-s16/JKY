Mexican food in an Italian themed resort. Sure, why not!

Came here at a recommendation of a coworker and sure glad I took his suggestion. The place was mellow for a Friday lunch. Grab a spot "outdoors" so you can pretend you're in Venice as the gondolas float on by.

We ordered the beef tacos and chicken fajitas entrees. Each comes with that addicting cilantro rice in that bright green hue. mmm...I could just eat that rice nonstop, and not because I'm Asian! The beans where meh. But, but...their beef and chicken were marinated just with the right spices which made the entrees so delish, both of us were borderline licking out plates. 

Oh, and you can't get Mexican food w/o a Margarita. Hot damn..those were divine...
