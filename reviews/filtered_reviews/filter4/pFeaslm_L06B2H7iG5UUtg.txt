I had been dying to come back to Cantina Laredo after the outstanding Yelp Gold Elite dinner I attended a little over a month ago.  The plan was to pick up my wife after she got out of work and I went over to Misti's CMYE at La Belle Terre in the meantime.  Unfortunately (or fortunately?) the treats they offered were really, really good and I couldn't bear to eat...just ...one.  

So I wasn't that hungry when we rolled in here.  We split an appetizer and entree.  But it looked like happy hour was truly where it was at with half price margaritas, $3 beer and half off the bar menu.  They run that from 4pm-7pm and after 9pm.  Ofcourse we're there at 7:30pm.  We made sure to order things that weren't discounted during happy hour.

Appetizer: My wife's only request is that she wanted something with cheese.  What?  At a Mexican restaurant???  Are you sure???  It didn't get much cheesier than the "Laredo Fundido" which was a huge bowl of cheese sauce with taco meat in it.  This would be excellent to share with a group.   I would've preferred the tableside guacamole.  A lot of tables ordered it and that looked great.

Entree: The "Enchilada Mole" was pretty good.  Mole isn't something I want to have most of the time but it sounded great and it delivered.  The sauce had good flavor and tasted like only mole could.

I'll definitely be back for some of the more exciting dishes when I have more of an appetite.  The outdoor area will be great when it gets warmer too.
