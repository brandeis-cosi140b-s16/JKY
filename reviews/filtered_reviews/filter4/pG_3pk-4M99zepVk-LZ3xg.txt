It was my wedding rehearsal dinner and I really wanted tapas for all the different tastebuds attending.  It's also sports/video poker bar, so not a romantic setting, but I didn't mind.  Some of my guests wanted to gamble anyway.  The executive chef, Oscar Sanchez, and the manager, Lisa, took real good care of me.  We went over the menu, the timing of the dishes, the different diets in our group, and I even was able to order dishes not on the menu.  How accommodating!  The service was impeccable, the prices reasonable, and the presentation mouth-watering.  Everyone attending was impressed with the entire experience and left with happy bellies.  Thank you, Toros, for taking care of us.  I'll always visit when I'm in town!
