Muy delicioso! This place has amazing Mexican food. It's so good that I'm writing this from my table after just finishing dinner here. There are pages and pages of specialties that you don't normally find in a typical Mexican restaurant in the US. I highly recommend the Mole Poblano, which is thinly grilled chicken breasts covered in a delicious brown mole sauce. It is hands down the best chicken mole I've ever had. It has a bit of heat but not too much. It is served with fresh, made in house flour tortillas. Most meals are served with fideo soup (noodles in a tomato broth), which my wife stated was very close to the one her Mexican grandmother used to make. The atmosphere is festive with live music and Mexican art, objects and wares as decor. A short drive from the strip, it's definitely worth the effort if you have use of a car, as we did. I found this restaurant on a USAToday.com city guide which mentioned that of the four locations in the area, this one on Desert Inn is best.
