Came here for the free show with A Change of Pace/Damn The Weather and fell in love with the venue. From the moment I approached the door, the scintillating and seductive sounds of Flamenco Por La Vida spilled onto the street, stopping me in the front room as I passed through the doors. Apparently, they are a Saturday night staple and worth the trip alone. The front room is intimate, and the bar has a decent-above average selection of wine and beer. No food this night, but the show was fantastic and the staff knowledgeable. Great to come into a concert venue and not deal with cranky bar staff and bouncers, even for a free show. Thanks for being classy, I will definitely be back! (I am reserving the final star for once I taste the food, so expect an update at somepoint in the future.)
