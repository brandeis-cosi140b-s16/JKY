I am so happy the Someburros has finally ventured North and opened a location in Scottsdale....although I really wish it was closer to Old Town where I live, but I will take what I can get!  The Borracho Burro is the best....a must try! 

And while you can't drive thru and order, the drive thru pick up window for take out is a nice perk!
