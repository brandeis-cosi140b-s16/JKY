This is our second time here. Honestly I didn't care the first time when I ordered something other than the tacos (apparently it was forgettable). 

Today we went in for taco Tuesday's and wow it was a great surprise. I love the variety of tacos they had which I missed the first time around. My favorite was the carne adada with Blue Cheese (something something azul). There was one with pineapple that was good as well! As much as I love a fried egg on my burger it doesn't go so well on a taco. Unfortunately, since I ordered four tacos by the time they arrived and with the variety I can't tell you the other flavors or be more specific with the names. 

You do get free chips and salsa. The chips are a bit plain but are nice and thick with a crunch. The plainness isn't something that salt can't fix. The salsa was delicious. I know a lot of the other reviews talked about the poor service. I was surprised about how long it took us to be greeted and for our order to be taken during an odd day lunch out. In addition no offer of a refill for our salsa was give.  

At $2.50 for a corn tortilla sized taco, this place is a bit pricey even if it was taco Tuesday's but it was delicious. This place won't be a one a week eat out option but for an occasional date would be perfect.  For the two of us the bill ended up to be $25 and my wife surprisingly mentioned that she wasn't filled which I never heard before. 

This place would be a 5 star if the service was tightened up and a little less expensive on the pricing. Although the price is now pretty much on par with where downtown Gilbert is headed.
