My daughter and I had early dinner last night.  Had a salmon wrap, cooked just I requested, and it was excellent.  Daughter just had salad with grilled chicken, which she said was delicious!  Salsa was fire roasted with a little heat which was to die for.  All this and great service.  Will definitely come back with hubby.
