This place is pretty awesome.  They had a killer tuna tartare type dish, some pretty good stir fried noodles, and some great guac (although IMO they added a bit to much sriracha or some other Asian chile type sauce to try and make it taste different than regular guac).  Pork buns were decent but a little doughy for my taste.  Really good margs with whipped salt.

Docking a star because the raw oyster served on top of the wagyu beef taco was nearly inedible---super fishy.
