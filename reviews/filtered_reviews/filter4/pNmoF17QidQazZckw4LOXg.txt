My husband and I came in to try the new place-he's a Vegas native and knew it way back when. Anyway, it's small (30 seats) and newly decorated (hipsterish) and we were the only ones here at 3pm on friday afternoon. We were greeted and seated warmly and quickly. I ordered the roasted beet salad and flautas with potatoes. Both were excellent and fairly priced. Hub got the skirt steak carne asada which was also good. My only complaint would be 1.the waiter was reticent to let me order the flowers with potatoes even though it's on the menu and had to go ask the chef if he would make it and 2. Seven dollars for a side of guacamole seems exorbitant. Overall it was a good experience and we will come here again.
