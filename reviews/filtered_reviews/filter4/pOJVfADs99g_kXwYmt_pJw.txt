Great food, great staff! This little place is so much better than the big chain Mexican restaurant across the street. Chips and salsa are delicious, and the enchiladas I usually order are fantastic! I do wish their drink prices were a bit cheaper, but that's just a minor issue :) 

There are usually families with small children, so be aware of that if you prefer a more adult environment. We usually do, but when we crave Mexican food, it's worth it :)
