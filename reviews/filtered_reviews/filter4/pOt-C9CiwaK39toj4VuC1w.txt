Randomly decided to stop in yesterday afternoon...I'm so glad I did!  I ordered the pork nachos with black beans and queso..they were SO yummy.  The portions are ridiculously huge, so I took the rest home and ate it for breakfast (weird eating pork nachos for breakfast, I know).  The service was very fast and friendly and they even sang a festive little nacho song.  I'll definitely come back!
