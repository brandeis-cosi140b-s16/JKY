Stayed at Aria and decided to get dinner here since I've it before in CA and enjoyed it. The atmosphere is dark and romantic and it's really nicely decorated. The jalapeno and strawberry margaritas were really good, and the jalapeno one was something different and interesting to try.   

Got the tuna ceviche to start with and it was very very good. Try it with the chips that they give you as they go well together.  

We ordered the tablita with steak, chicken and cartinas and really enjoyed it. This is a huge dish to share between 2 people....the beef was by far the best, it was cooked perfectly and was really tender.

Pricey but definitely worth it.
