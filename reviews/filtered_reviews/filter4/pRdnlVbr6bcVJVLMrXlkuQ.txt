Good but not quite 4.5 stars good.  I had a barbacoa taco and two chicken tacos.  My friend had two fish tacos.  Taste was good but other aspects lacked a bit.

The tortillas completely fell apart when picking them up. That's why a lot of places put two tortillas under the taco.  The meat was good quality - woo hoo!.  Flavor was good but there was some cabbag-y stuff in the tacos.  I've lived in Mexico and "ain't seen no cabbage in my tacos" before, but ok.

The owner was awesome.  Really liked him and his attitude.  So, I'd definitely recommend but go in expecting "good" or "really good" but not blow your mind amazing.
