There is an obvious mental disconnect between my present day and past selves. Although I don't eat much now, when looking over the menu the fat boy in me still says yes, I want that. In the past I used to go to Mexican restaurants and order the taco, burrito, enchilada special so after seeing a Groupon for Blue Adobe Grille (although I didn't purchase it), I stopped after being in the area. I noticed the Santa CaFe - which allows customers to choose two or three items from a list of about 6. Pork tamale sounded good, as well as the shredded beef taco, and to complete the trifecta a chicken enchilada. 

The meal began with complimentary tri-colored chips with a nice chipotle salsa. I had some of those, along with a frozen margarita with the Chambord float (called the Old School Float). I also finished off two waters. When the plate arrived it had a side of pinto beans and rice (both excellent, by the way). I saw the taco and at first glance didn't think anything of it, but when I went to wrangle it I realized it was the fattest taco I have seen in my life. Suddenly I felt as if I were on an episode of Man vs. Food. I started on the taco and used the napkin in hand technique perfected by Adam Richman. The taco had a nice dizzled sauce on top that had a little heat and a double layer of tortilla to hold the tasty contents. I felt full - but that can't be - it was just a taco...I had to at least make an attempt at the enchilada and tamale. I had a bite of each and had to throw in the towel. In this battle of man vs. food - food won.
