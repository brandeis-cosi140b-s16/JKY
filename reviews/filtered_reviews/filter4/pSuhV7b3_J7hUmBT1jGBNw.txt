I wish I could get a couple airbuses full of people from my city to show them what tacos should taste like. Tacos El Gordo exemplifies taco authenticity.

Walking in you may ask yourself, what line for what? I admit if I had not learned Spanish through Rosetta Stone I'd be tornadoing in confusion. But take your time to google the meats before you choose your lines and you will be fine!

The taco dilemma was in full effect here. What combination plate should I create?

My Taco Creation

(2) Asada: The asada was nice. It wasn't full of fatty pieces nor was it over salty. You can taste a bite and feel like you're in your mothers vecindario. 4.25/5

(1) Lengua: I always need that tongue action and Tacos El Gordo gave it to me nicely. Soft and chewy and flavorful, no fault here. 4.25/5

(1) Al Pastor: Would of been 2 but someone drunk dropped one. My favorite out of them all. The meat was marinated to perfection. 4.75/5

(1) Asada Sope: This was okay, sope ingredients were eh. 3/5

Tortillas: Not handmade but it's a street taco not a mercado taco. Fits the schema well. 

Customer Service was Mexican fast paced, meaning no smiles, just order and keep it moving, except for the cashier (;

Tacos are made to be eaten here. It's quite that simple.
