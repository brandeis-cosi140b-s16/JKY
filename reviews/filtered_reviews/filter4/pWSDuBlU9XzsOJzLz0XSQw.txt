I was in the area and craving Mexican food.  I recognized the Robertos name from San Diego.  We got carne asada burritos to go.  They were really good with lots of tasty well seasoned meat inside.   The sauces from the salsa bar were all very good and the carrots were crispy abs hot.  
  If you crave California style Mexican food then Robertos will definitely satisfy your cravings.
