Another Phoenix gem! 

Don't expect hard-shell tacos, refried beans and Spanish rice here! Instead, expect bold flavors, fresh ingredients and Chef-inspired regional Mexican cuisine. 

Table-side guacamole here is a must and some menu items are seasonal. The probability of a wait is high, but worth it. 

Happy hour (half off drinks) is only from 2-5 pm. 

Delish!! Enjoy!
