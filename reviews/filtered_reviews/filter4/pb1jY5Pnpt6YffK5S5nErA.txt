Really neat place, named appropriately so.
Like others mentioned, there's no sign outside. (It's right next to Luci's on 16th st! )
I usually sit at the big copper community table. I have never been anywhere else that I get to look at a stranger's meal right next to me. 
I've also never been anywhere that said stranger offers to share their three cheese pizza with me! score! (delicious)

I've come for breakfast and for lunch, and anything you order is an experience.
I really like the green chile cheeseburger for lunch and the green chile meatloaf and eggs for breakfast. Yes, I like beef, and this place has plenty of it! Splurge and get beef tenderloin benedict for breakfast.

The service is good, but they aren't there to pamper you. You can kinda figure that out when you walk in or if you just think about the name!
Don't bring your kids if they're small, but really, it's not a place for kids anyway even if they're not small.(No high chairs!) It's for grown ups.

I've gone here at least 5 times, and I can't tell you where the bathroom is or if they even have one. Or the elusive back door.

Guess I'll have to go back and find it!
