Yum, yum, yum.  Stopped by chance today and was pleased to find the NEW El Sombrero had undergone a change of ownership and a facelift.  Menu is new as the focus is on an upscale Mexican, but don't let that stop you.  Started with a freshly made guacamole.  It had the right amount of heat with a little bit of chunkiness that went perfectly with the complimentary chips.  I had the Costillas en Salsa Verde (pork ribs with green sauce).  I am sucker for a good green chile.  The sauce was not too spicy and the rib meat fell off the bones.  Served perfectly with charro beans and rice.  My partner had Chicken Mole.  Wow!  I had a taste and know that is what I am ordering next time.  The mole was smoky with a delicate peanut flavor.  Irma told me they make their own mole by grinding peanuts and adding a delicious combination of spices.  Jose was our server who made us feel at home and made sure we were taken care of.  They just opened 2 days ago and are still getting in the swing, but this place is very promising.  They may need to do something to soundproof the room which got a little loud.  Maybe some rugs will help.
