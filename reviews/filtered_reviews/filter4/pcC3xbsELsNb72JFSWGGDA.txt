I love Mexican food and my wife loves Asian food. Lucky for us we have KoMex! Best of both worlds. Definitely have to try the spicy pork tacos with the fusion hot sauce. The beef is leagues above what you get from Roberto's or similar taco shops. They also have chips, salsa, and guacamole while you wait. Btw we had excellent service and the food was done within 5-10 minutes. My only suggestion would be to less oil in the cooking.
