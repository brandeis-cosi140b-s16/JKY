I really didn't know what to expect from this place. The combination of Korean and Mexican didn't immediately appeal to me, but the reviews were good so I figured I should give it a try. It is up the street from Meadows Mall in the corner of a strip mall. Which made me even more leery.  On the plus side, it was pretty packed on a Wednesday night...a good sign right?

They serve house made chips, salsa, & guacamole while you wait. We ordered chicken fried rice, flautas, and a cheesesteak. Everything was pretty delicious and made to order. The service was good. The bill came to under $25 and we had enough left over for another meal.

This place is pretty small, but definitely worth checking out. We will be back!!
