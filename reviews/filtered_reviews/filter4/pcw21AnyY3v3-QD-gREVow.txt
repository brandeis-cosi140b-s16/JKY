I am actually shocked I liked this place so much! I am never a fan of a sports bar type place and it seemed odd... like the decor didn't know exactly what it was wanting to be. Mexican-inspired? A TGIFridays? My Vegan tendancies are also quite hard to please in this type of situation. My poor husband, all the man wanted were some good Nachos.

To my incredible surprise they had a VEGAN MENU!!! I had to personally request it and there were a couple snags, (coming out first w/ sour cream... which is DAIRY) but I was extremely happy with what I ordered. They were eager to please and were extremely kind... so with a couple mess-ups I don't mind if the staff handles it in stride.

The hot salsa is a MUST TRY! Mmmm... I love it if I can still feel a little tingle in my mouth an hour later. (wow, that sounded dirty)

My husband got his Thai Nachos (which he LOVED), I got a vegan option and it was ALL GOOD. I still am not a fan of the decor, but hey----  you can't win them all.
