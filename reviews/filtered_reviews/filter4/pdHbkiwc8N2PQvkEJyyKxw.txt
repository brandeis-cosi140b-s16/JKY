PAZ Cantina has been one of my favorite downtown go-tos for some time now. Used to eat here every day when I worked within walking distance of it. Appears to be expanding a bit, too, which is cool - it's a large space and deserves to be filled all week long.

I *really* want to give PAZ five stars except that service has been consistently slow. That said, "slow" does not imply "bad". In fact, the servers here have always been truly wonderful and I look forward to interacting with them every time.

*Major upside to PAZ is their menu. SUCH good food at really affordable prices. My best friend always enjoys 1 or 3 of their $3 margaritas. The beer menu leaves a bit to be desired, but I never care too much so long as I'm stuffing my face with free chips and salsa.

Tinga Torta is the all-star of their menu, in my personal opinion. I have to CONVINCE myself to try new things when I go. The breakfast burritos are also delicious. And huge! You definitely get your money's worth here. Just be prepared to hunker down for a while, that's all.

Music is always just a little too loud for my taste, but that's part of the theme. Interior artwork is cool, outside patio is comfortable (even during hotter months), and they have games! Cornhole, ping-pong, etc. Really just a fun place to grab some food and relax.

I don't live or work anywhere near PAZ, but I still find excuses to come visit. I suggest you do the same, especially if you've never been. You won't be disappointed.
