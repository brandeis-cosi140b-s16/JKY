I'm guessing it is called Abuela's cause there are actually grandmas working the kitchen according to the husband. 

I was getting my hair done at Dcano nearby and found this place on Yelp. Sent the husband here to pick up some food for us and it was delicious!! So simple yet so good. We got 2 bowls.. 1 fish and 1 shrimp. Both were battered and fried and served with rice and beans. They also gave us some chips and salsa.

With some fresh lime juice + the orange and green hot sauces, the fish and shrimp were perfect! Otherwise, they were a bit dry on their own.

Really affordable prices as well. Will definitely stop by again if I'm ever in the area.
