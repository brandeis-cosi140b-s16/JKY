I enjoyed this restaurant. Came to southside looking  to go to another place and ultimately made a last minute to decision to come here after much positive word of mouth. i wasn't disappointed. Got the starter red snapper ceviche which included pineapples and added a fruity twist to the traditional citric tangy flavor. I appreciated it but overall do appreciate the traditional ceviche which i still have a craving for.
The waiters were pretty nice and i enjoyed the complimentary nachos with spicy and mild salsa.
Tacos I got included the tofu, chicken, tuna, calamari and juan epstein. Avoid the chicken, its nothing special and could easily be made yourself. The others were a lot more enjoyable. Especially the calamari and the very interesting juan epstein. Calamari was crispy and fresh while the epstein was an interesting combination of duck kimchi mustard and pickle. it was sour but I wouldn't want it any other way honestly. The tuna pleased as expected but didn't wow me and the tofu satisfied any craving I had for tofu. 
I left pretty full and will probably come back to try their other flavors.
Add the bar seemed like a nice place to pregame
