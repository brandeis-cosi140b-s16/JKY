Wow, another Taco Y Taco and this one in Henderson.  Love it.  I am a huge fan of really authentic tacos and I love the selection.  Here are some hints:

a. If your idea or Mexican food is Cafe Rio, Nacho Daddy, Del Taco, Taco Bell, or having a burrito or chips and salsa, it is best for you to stay at those restaurants, because this is NOT going to match your idea of Mexican Food.

b.  The meat here is absolutely fantastic:

-Buche - Pork Stomach
-Carnitas - Braised Pork
-Suedero - Beef from the upper leg / lower belly
-Cesos - The thinking part of the cow
-Lengua - Tongue
-Cabeza - Meet from the head of the cow, so it has many things, as you can imagine.
-Pibil - Slow Roasted Pork
-Al Pastor - Love it, they shave the meat directly from the spit.
-Taco Asada - Grilled Beef
-Chorizo - Pork Sausage
-Mulas - I guess you can say this is a "slider" but more like a taco mini quesadilla.

c.  Prices are all about 2.25 per taco.  they also had other items here, breakfast burritos, and some other items other than tacos.

d. Salsa Bar has great hot and mild sauces as well as fresh salsa.  This was very tasty.

e.  The ambiance is the same exact set up from when this place was a pub called The Republic.  This means all the decor and details are not too authentic.

f.  Music - They have a great set up to play loud music.  I felt it was too loud.

g.  Be careful - going during normal hours, the long lines her overwhelming.

GK says, try this place out.
