I was here with a friend in December.  We had a great meal.  I had the buffalo nachos and my buddy had a veggie burrito.  We shared chips and i had soda.


Our server Christin was fantastic.  She kept filling up our drinks and chips.  She recommended my item from the happy hour menu.  She was sweet and cute and just a great personality.

Our bill was $35 with tip which I thought was not bad given the quality of food and awesome service.  If you are concerned with prices, try the happy hour menu...my nachos (which were plenty big) were only $6

I'll be back!
