We always end up going on a Sunday which is nice because they usually have a lady doing face painting and ballon animals. I think it adds a lot of fun to the day seeing kids sword fight with balloons. The staff are very friendly and can provide useful information about the menu items if you need help making your selection. The food, and of course the plates come out hot and always well prepared. They offer all the staple food including complimentary chips and salsa, which sometimes is hotter than you probably will be expecting. That could be good or bad for you depending on your heat tolerance. Demerits for a difficult parking lot to navigate and on really busy days you may be required to take a bit of a walk. In the summers this is not ideal. You may also find the dining space cramped, but it's never really bothered me, much. Great place for the whole family especially on a cool Sunday afternoon.
