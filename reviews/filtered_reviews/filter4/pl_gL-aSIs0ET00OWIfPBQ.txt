My husband and I discovered this place through the mighty powers of Yelp because of it's high ratings. 

Upon walking into the restaurant, the first thing you see is a huge meat pineapple. Seriously! 

The line was pretty long but moved fairly fast. The place was PACKED! Luckily for us, the time we spent in line was spent talking to people around us to find out just what the heck we should order and what the heck the meat pinapple was.

The meat pineapple is pork on a vertical spit with pineapple on top so that the yummy juices drained down onto the meat. Through the other patrons, we found out that if we ordered the Tacos de Adobada we would get to partake of the meat pineapple. We were also advised to order 3, which seemed to be a sufficient amount since they are rather small. I did see several people go back for a second (or third) meal, so if you're hungry you might want to order more. 

I can certainly see going back here as a tradition for our Vegas visits. The food is delicious, and definitely more "authentic" than we get in Nashville.
