This place is usually busy with a 20 minute wait time at peak hours on Friday and Saturday. Their margaritas are awesome and they even use fresh orange juice instead of all that sugary sweet and sour mix. Portions are large in my opinion and as a couple you can leave stuffed with a 25-30$ bill (excluding alcohol). My favorites are the queso dip, tostadas with pork, and their chicken tacos because they are so fresh tasting. Sometimes the service is a little slow, but overall this is my first choice if I want mexican food!
