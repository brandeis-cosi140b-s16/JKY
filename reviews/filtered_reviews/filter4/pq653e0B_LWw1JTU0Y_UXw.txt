I FINALLY made it to a Fuego. I can never make it Fuego Bistro when it's open and I've heard some lackluster things about Fuego Tacos. Fortunately I now have Fuego Cityscape just a few blocks from where I work where Vitamin T used to be.

I had a tasty Carne Asada quesadilla that consisted of meat, cheese and some tasty veggies that all came with a kick. This was accompanied by chipotle sour cream. Between that, the salsa and the side of guac that I ordered, there was just not enough quesadilla to enjoy all the great dipping options.

This also came with tasty rice and black beans which, to my surprise were delicious. because I HATE black beans (they go against everything I raised to believe was good Mexican food according to my East L.A. Nana)

The inside is cheerful and decorated with local art and the people that work there are friendly. I need to come back for Happy Hour methinx. Another good addition to Cityscape.
