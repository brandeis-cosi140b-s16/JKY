National Margarita Day, so decided to go to CR and eat in the new location last night.  
Yes, Friday was National Margarita Day!

CR is still BYOB but if you want a Margarita, CR has all the mixers and will make your Margarita.  Just bring the alcohol.  Most tables and groups at the bar seemed to have either a bottle of wine or their favorite beer, as well as a few Margarita's.
  
Found out it was the first day for the New Expanded Menu!

There was a 30 minute wait for a table and not much room to wait.  Had fun talking with the others waiting for a table and a couple at the end of the bar. 

Service good!  New menu items were good!  Enjoyable larger restaurant!  Larger but still relatively small so you may have to wait or do take out.   Good food and a fun place to eat!
