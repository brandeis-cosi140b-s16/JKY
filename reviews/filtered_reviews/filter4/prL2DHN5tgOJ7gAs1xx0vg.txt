Another of my favorites.  They have a GREAT happy hour, with small plates for $5 ea (at the bar). I a particularly fond of the beef tenderloin with brie served on small slices of toast and the house salad.  The restaurant itself is very NOT Phoenix...big plush bars, dark room, roaring fire.  When you are in the Rokeril you can forget that it is a seething inferno outside.  The only reason that I am giving them a 4 instead of a 5 is that their cuts of meat seem to be fattier than I am accustomed to...my SO and I have noticed this with both beef and lamb cuts.  Overall a fantastic dining experience though...and we are both always happy to diner here.
