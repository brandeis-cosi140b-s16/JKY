The Kings of Torta I say!! The Torta Mexicana is what you want. Thinly cut steak with grilled onions, avocado and big fat Jalapeno right in the middle! The neighbor hood isn't that great after 5pm. I look Mexican so I blend in well like a chameleon. But it isn't until I try to order that my cover is blown and they figure out that I only speak English and Californian - however it does relax the nervous white folk standing around waiting for their take out!!  =))

P.s. Parking lot sucks and isn't well lit but fight your way in! - You'll be glad you did.
