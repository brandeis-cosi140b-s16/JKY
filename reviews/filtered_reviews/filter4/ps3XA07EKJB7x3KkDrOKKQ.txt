Went here on a Saturday at 7:30pm. We were a party of 2 and had to wait an hour and a half for a table.  Because of the expected wait, we left and came back after~30-40minutes. I think you have to let them know you're coming back so they don't assume you've given up. I agree that the waiting area is very small when busy. If it wasn't so cold outside, I wouldn't have minded sitting on the benches. I guess you have to be really patient!

Food: I got the tacos de pescado (fish tacos) and my friend got the cochinita pibil (slow roasted pork). My dish came with either a side salad or fries; i opted for the salad. The tacos were delicious. The fried halibut was not too greasy and the avocado was fresh and ripe! The drizzle of chipotle cream sauce was just enough to give it a little spice. Yummy! I tried my friend's pork, and I didn't enjoy it as much as my dish. He had a side of something that was SUPER spicy!!!!! I don't remember what it was called but it kinda resembled mashed potatoes. Portions were a good size, not too little, not too much.

For dessert, we shared the Churros. I was a little hesitant because I read it was filled with goat's milk caramel. I love churros, and i love caramel, but goat's milk caramel? I was pleasantly surprised. The churros were divine! I think it may have been too much for us since we'd eaten all of our food. But I'd say definitely go for the Churros if you have a little  room in your belly!!!!

The place was a little loud since they had live music and lots of people. The decor was nice, not super fancy which I like.  Our server was very helpful in my choice of dish.  

PROS: great fish tacos. AWESOME churros. good service.
CONS: Wait during busy times (they don't take reservations either...boo), parking is supposedly tough since parking lot in the back is quite tiny though. We were able to park down the street no problem.
