Carlsbad Tavern has been a favorite for many years but this was my first trip in a while. The Osso Bucco continues to be a special dish and the veggie enchiladas had good flavor. Drinks from the bar were well made. The bartender was friendly and chatted us up while we waited to be seated. We ate on the deck just outside the bar which offered a good view of what turned out to be a spectacular sunset. I definitely feel like I got a good value and so will continue to come back. I only award five stars to truly one-of-a-kind restaurants. This falls just short of that but certainly does not disappoint.
