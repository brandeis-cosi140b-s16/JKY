The new setting is so much better. Lots more seating. The food and portions are good. The only thing I do not like about this place is the smell that comes from the trays on which they serve the food. They stink so awful and I almost gag whenever I sit down with it. I have to get up and get rid of the tray first before I can start eating. I know its minor, but it does put a very huge damper on the whole experience. 

Good for groups. Will go here again but I am going to have to talk to the owners about their smelly trays.
