After really enjoying a happy hour visit a few months ago, we finally went by for dinner.  It was terrific, with a few minor hiccups.

We arrived at 7 and were shocked to find a full parking lot and a line to get in.  Nonetheless, we were seated within 15 minutes.  We really love the atmosphere here.  Dark, urban and romantic with a kind of northeastern feel.

Drinks first.  We ordered a glass of red wine, a whiskey sour and an old fashioned.  The red wine came right away.  About 5 minutes later the waitress stopped by and said "he's looking for the ingredients for the other drinks."  Hmmm.  We amused ourselves for the next 10 minutes wondering how a bar could not have the ingredients for a whiskey sour or an old fashioned.  She returned with the whiskey sour and said "He just doesn't have the ingredients for an old fashioned."

FYI, here are the ingredients for an Old Fashioned:
Bourbon
Soda Water
Sugar
Bitters
A cherry and an orange peel

We found this hilarious.  I changed my order to a Manhattan and that took about a minute to arrive.  Drinks here are large and strong.

Three of shared a steak tartare and ahi tuna app.  Both were excellent and the steak tartare was perfectly executed and presented.  The appetizers here really rock.

We ordered the three dishes that the waitress recommended, a chile rellenos (from the old Robertson's menu, which is also available), a chicken schnitzel and the beef tenderloin salad.  

Dinner arrived and I took a bite of my "chicken schnitzel."  Wow, that's some soft chicken I thought.  Wait a second  - that's not chicken!  The cook had apparently unilaterally upgraded me to the sea bass.  Well, no matter, it was delicious.

All in all a terrific dinner.  Service is charming and very friendly and the drinks and food are very satisfing, despite the occasional Fawlty Towers moments.
