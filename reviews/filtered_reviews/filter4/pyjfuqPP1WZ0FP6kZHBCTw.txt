I thought it was rather funny to have a traditional Mexican restaurant in the Venetian... and right on the canal too!  But it's Vegas so I rolled with it.

The food was surprisingly delicious, but the service was a little iffy....  just slow and it seemed like a long conversation just to put one order in.  Despite the speed, the food came out perfect.  And I scarfed down what I could of my beef enchiladas.  The entr√©es come with black beans and cilantro rice, which were awesome, but there was too much of it.  I always feel bad when I leave food on my plate.

We had just seen our boy, Pacquiao win his title event on the casino floor which was invigorating, but we were also starving too.    Since we were so hungry... I think that made it seem like the service was slower, but looking at our watches afterward... we did kill a whole bunch of time just sitting there and eating.

We also ordered chips and guacamole... which were nice and hot and good.  

Overall it was a good meal and it was nice sitting next to the canal and hearing the gondoliers sing their songs to the couples riding in the boats.
