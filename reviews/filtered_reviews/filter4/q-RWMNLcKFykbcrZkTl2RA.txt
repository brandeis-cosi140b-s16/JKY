Restaurant Mexico was a place recommended to me long ago by people familiar with AZ food when I was first coming to town. I have been there many times. The food has a great home kitchen flavor and is on the more authentic side than most Mexican food found in the US. The service has been hit or miss on my visits, but is generally okay. The food prices are very low. It is easy to fill up on great tasting food without spending more than $5-10 per person. Chips and salsa come free at the start of the meal and are pretty good. My favorite item is the chorizo. I recommend getting it on tostadas or just as a side bowl with a few tortillas to fold on your own.
