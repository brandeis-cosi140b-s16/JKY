I always forget this place is here.  It has probably been 15 years since I have visited Valle Luna.  I was looking on my nav system for a new place to take the kids and rediscovered Valle Luna and I am glad I did.

It was very busy when we went in, there was an ASU game and the lounge was very boisterous.  The kids enjoyed the view of the lake.

I can vouche for the chili verde pork enchiladas and my grill like there ground beef tacos with rice and beans (they said the tacos weren't as good as what mom and dad make though ;) but they ate it all up.  

Chips are bean dip are similar to Serrano's and the kids really liked them.
