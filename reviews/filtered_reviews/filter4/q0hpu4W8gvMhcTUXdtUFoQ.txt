Awesome venue!  We were starving and not sure if they even had food.  Yup, they did.  Best burrito I've ever had!  Not sure if that was my empty stomach talking or what.  The bartenders were super friendly and chill.  I love that they have bathrooms inside the venue, as well as a bar.  Can't wait to see another show.
