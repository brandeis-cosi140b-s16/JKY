Whoa... everything I had was delicious! Quesadilla with red chile pork was possibly the best quesadilla I've ever had. The red chile pork is amazingly delicous! That tortilla soup had depth in flavors like none other. And the margarita whipped up by bartender Ally was a great balance of citrus and tequila.  On a second visit, just this last weekend, I could not tear myself from the red chile pork... However, I did mix it up and get a fish taco in addition to the red chile pork taco for lunch.  Side note: At lunch, you can mix and match your tacos with either two or three selections!  The fish taco was good, but does not even come close to comparing to that red chile pork.... I could go on for days about it's deliciousness.  But I won't.  Go taste it yourself, and save some for me!! 

**IMPORTANT** On Saturdays they have an all day special on carafes of margaritas for $12 and carafes of sangria for $15.  Again, just save some for me!
