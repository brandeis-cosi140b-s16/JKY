Went here very late Friday night after picking up a friend from the airport in town from SF. We sat on the patio, but I noticed the interior was v. cool and the bar was massive. Although we were here for late dinner, I can't wait to go back for happy hour sometime. The margaritas were incredible - I tried the blood orange and my friend had some kind of pomegranate-something-something. They were both fantastic, and the tequila list was strong which is a big plus in my book. The drink list was refreshingly innovative and unique. Even the chips and salsa are worthy of mention. It's been a while since I've had guac near as tasty as at Blanco. We both had different varieties of tacos which I thought were outstanding. I usually consider the accompanying rice and beans as filler which I almost always pass over to save room for more booze, but not this time. The only complaint I had was the patio seating wasn't very good for eating - great for drinks and socializing, but we were posed in a constant hunch the entire time as we sucked down our food.  The patio seating does have couches and comfy chairs which are perfect for the happy hour setting. The place also seems to attract a fun, vibrant crowd. It probably goes without saying, as I'm certain I'm the only r'tard who would choose to eat outdoors in Scottsdale right now, but definitely eat at the bar or the in the dining room.
