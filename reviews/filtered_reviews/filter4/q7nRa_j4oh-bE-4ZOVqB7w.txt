Man if you like tacos or Mexican food you should definetly hit this place up!!! The meat is super tender and well seasoned and the prices are very affordable, great for people on a budget in Vegas. The service was good and fast, there was a bit of a line when we showed up but they served us fairly quickly! The overall quality of the food was excellent! Only thing we didn't like was the fact that they charge the same for a flour mula as they do a corn mula ( the corn one is twice as small) and the lay out of the restaurant. Other than that it was awesome!!!
