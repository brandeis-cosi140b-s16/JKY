I (finally) tried Comedor Guadalajara with a friend in from out of town last weekend. I was surprised by how busy they were on a Sunday at lunch time- there were people crowded in front of the restaurant and they announced names over an intercom. Whoa. We were seated fairly quickly in the (extremely large) dining room and service was efficient from that point on. The chips and salsa were more like chips and hot sauce, but they tasted good... I love the spiciness of the sauce and put it on everything. When it came to ordering, we were a little disappointed. My friend is a vegetarian and thought Mexican food would be no problem, but our waitress didn't know of almost anything on the menu that was vegetarian (most items have lard). He ended up getting cheese enchiladas and thought they were pretty 'meh.' Here's the real kicker though, I got the chicken burrito, which was absolutely delicious.... the chicken was juicy and cooked well... but the burrito mainly consisted of fantastic and flavorful grilled veggies...the type that would be perfect for a vegetarian perhaps.... hmmm. Anyway, other than that mishap, I really enjoyed my burrito and would go back to get it again. 


PS prices were reasonable, especially at lunch, and the portions were large.
