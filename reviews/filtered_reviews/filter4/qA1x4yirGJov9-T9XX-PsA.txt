This restaurant has it's pluses and minuses. With Yelp, we made reservations for 7:00 on the patio. We were seated within 10 minutes on a busy Saturday. The new location is much nicer, airier than the East Blvd. location. I really love the atmosphere and decor. Our waitress was pleasant. I ordered a house margarita which was sweet and not very strong. For dinner, I had the Marco Polo tacos. The tacos were excellent. However, the rice and refried beans were dry and bland. For atmosphere and service, I give it a 5. For food and drinks, I give it a 3.5. So I averaged it out to a 4.
