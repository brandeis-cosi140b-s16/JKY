so has anyone been to Cabo Fish Tacos. I went for the first time and it was so good the only thing was i had to wait for 20 mints for a drink because they couldn't find the bladder wow. but other then that the tacos are great and the salsa was not very good I'm not a fan of that 
well i hope everyone will try this place it is very good
