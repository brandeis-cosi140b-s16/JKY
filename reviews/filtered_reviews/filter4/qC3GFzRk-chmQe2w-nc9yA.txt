This is a pleasant surprise for airport food.  This is real food, a bit pricey but it's in an airport.  It's a lively place with colorful artwork on the walls and bright overstuffed banquettes along the walls.  There's a busy bar area too.  We didn't have much time so we ordered quick and asked for rush on the food and they accommodated us without complaint.  I had the cochinta pibil torta which was very tasty, orange scented slow cooked pork, pickled red onion, Mexican cheese, beans, pico de gallo, guacamole on crusty bread.  Yummy.  My son had the steak Ricardo - a perfectly cooked steak served with a bunch of Mexican accoutrements over fries.  Also very tasty.  This is a nice choice if you've got some time at Sky Harbor.
