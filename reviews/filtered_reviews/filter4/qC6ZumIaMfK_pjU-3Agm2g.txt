Some very interesting takes on a Mexican style restaurant! It's a cafeteria service in which you proceed down a service line and select an Enchilada, Taco, or Soup and then your choices of meat, tortilla, sauce, salsa, and extras. They then baked it to a crispy, toasty, finish. Similar to Chipolte and Rio Bravo.

I  ordered two beef short rib Enchiladas, with half corn/flour tortillas, red sauce, and Guacamole and extra Cheese accompaniements. Also a side dish of green chiles, cornbread, cheese and spices that was very tasty.
