One of the best chain restaurants around. I don't understand the poor reviews! Every time I visit, I'm pleased with the food, service, and prices. And today was no exception.

My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch. I usually get the brisket tacos, which are fantastic. But I wanted to change it up, so I got the three-item lunch combo with chicken tortilla soup, a ground beef taco, and a mushroom and spinach enchilada. The spouse had the lunch-sized beef fajitas. Each came with a side of rice and beans, and unlimited chips and salsa (we only had one bowl). We had so much food that we both had leftovers. We also each had a grande house margarita, which was good -- not great -- and I had an icy cold goblet of Dos Equis amber. Yum!

My husband enjoyed his food, and my meal was good as well, although I'm pretty sure I will stick with the brisket tacos next time. As I said, I'm baffled by the poor reviews because the staff was great -- from the hostess, to our server, to the manager who stopped in to see how we were doing -- and the reasonably priced food was pretty tasty. I just wish there was an On the Border closer to my house. Or, then again, maybe I don't, because I'd probably be dropping a pretty penny in there for happy hour every week!

If you're in the mood for some Tex Mex, give On the Border a try. It's not like mama (or abuela, if you're lucky) used to make, but it's pretty good in a pinch.
