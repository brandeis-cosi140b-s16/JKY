HATE  Nothing.

DISLIKE  Service can be inconsistent.

LIKE  Neil (the server), Paco (the executive chef) and Raf (the bartender). $20 all you can eat street tacos on Thursday. Industry specials. The flan. The location. Variety of salsa.

LOVE  The margarita/tequila selection. The menu. The decor/atmosphere.
