This was definitely an out-of-the-typical-Mexican-food-box experience! The food was really high quality, and the service was excellent! One of our party thought her dish had too much pepper, and the waiter was apologetic, sent the food right back, and it was quickly remade and brought back. They definitely want to serve their guests and give them the best experience possible!
