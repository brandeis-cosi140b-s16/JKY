50 YEARS IN BUSINESS

Most impressive restaurant decor plus our server was dressed to the nines in his native Mexican attire.  Maybe we've been to too many stark taquerias. 

Menu items ordered:

27.  Cheese Enchilada and Ground Beef Taco with rice and beans for Momo ....  nothing to write home about ... just most filling.

58.  Chimichanga with pork, chili verde, enchilada style for $1.00 more for Yu-go ... now his entree was the better of the two ... again he finished off his Chimichanga.

Parking is not an issue.  The bar is in the back in a small separate room with "Banos" close by.  Chapala's has been around since 1965.
