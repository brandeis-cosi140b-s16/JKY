Love, love, love. That's if you can find it, of course.  This gem is really tucked away - hence, the "hideaway."  Dick's is unmarked in the strip mall at 16th and Bethany between the hardware store and Luci's.  It makes for the perfect Saturday or Sunday brunch spot, as long as you don't mind dark (low light / no windows) quarters.  

They have great Sunday mimosa specials - $5! Can't beat that! My favorite dishes are the traditional Mexican dishes. Hands down, the chicken enchiladas with both red and green sauce are the best. The chips / salsa rock too - although it's not complimentary. Diner beware... their mexican food is spicy, so order a margarita or a glass of milk to dull the spice.

Oh, and check out the back bathroom - funny and odd (not the one off the kitchen).
