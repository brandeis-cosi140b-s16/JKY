The service here was excellent and for that reason I'll be back. 

As far as the food, the quality was good but it didn't hit a bullseye for me. The salsa tasted a bit like spaghetti sauce, the Fideo had very think spaghetti line noodles rather than the thin.. Little weird but good flavor. The chile verde was excellent, the beans and rice were just ok. Lunch specials give you a ton of food, great value.
