Great location and great guac made tableside. We had dinner on a Friday night and just watched all the drunk college kids leaving the pool. It was great entertainment watching them stumble by heading into the MGM itself.  Scary but good fun!  The tableside guac was excellent. The service was excellent. Food (other than guac)  was good but not excellent. We have been here before and will return. Great location, fair prices, great service, great margaritas and good food!  All in all good package and solid 4 stars.
