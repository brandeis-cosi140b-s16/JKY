I would give this place 4 1/2 stars if I could.  The tamales were tasty and I especially enjoyed the warm bean dip for the delicious chips.  I would give them 5 stars had the atmosphere been a bit better.  I didn't care for the lighting (it was dark outside) and the ambience was not so great.  Not unexpected for a low priced restaurant.  It's nice to see family run restaurants that serve good food,
