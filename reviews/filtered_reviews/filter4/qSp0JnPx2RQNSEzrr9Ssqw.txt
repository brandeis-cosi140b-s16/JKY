Dude, I can't even lie.. I usually won't touch a Mexican spot inside a resort, casino, tourist attraction.. I just have too much self respect for my stomach. I was in Vegas last weekend and met a few of my Dutch friends, and of course they saw this place and wanted to get their grub on.. so who am I to turn down a tourist wish? 

The place is actually pretty nice, a full bar right at the front and the layout is pretty clean. I ordered the Mahi Mahi fish tacos with black beans and rice, and I gotta say.. they were the BEST fish tacos I've ever had. Believe me when I say.. I've had me some fish tacos during my life.. but these were just so damn tasty. The dutchies at the table enjoyed their food too, so all in all it was a damn good meal. Only 4 stars because the price was a bit high, but otherwise I'll be back.
