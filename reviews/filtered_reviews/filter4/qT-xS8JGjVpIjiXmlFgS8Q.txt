The atmosphere is what really makes this place. The waterfall out front, the cantina feel of the outside eating, the decorative tables and art on the walls all lends to the good feelings you get when you walk in.

The food is great as well. The mole sauce is one of the best I've had. You will not go wrong if you're looking for great Mexican food.
