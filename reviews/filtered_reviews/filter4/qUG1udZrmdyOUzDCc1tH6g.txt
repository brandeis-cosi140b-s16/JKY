The 20 vegetable fried rice is AMAZING and life changing. Even if you don't like spicy, the chili sauce is so awesome, do not pass on getting it--it's so ridiculous (think garlic, a little salty, and little spice). Perfect blend of crunchiness and flavor. I see why the restaurant as a whole has a 3 star rating. We tried several other dishes that were just 'ok': Carnitas Tacos, Lucky 6 Dim Sum, Dan Dan Mian, and Shrimp Mojo. Just ok--nothing spectacular about any of these choices...
