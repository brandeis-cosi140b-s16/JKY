Los Reyes de la Torta translates into the Kings of the Mexican Sandwich! And when they serve you that plate of torta, oh man, how can you not feel like a king?!

This thing is absolutely packed with every ingredient that they could've thought of. Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, sausage, chorizo and eggs. All enlightened with tomato, onions, jalape√±o and avocado. Ya it may seem like a massive cluster and it really is, but for some reason, everything works awesome together like a fully realized superhero team. So props to these guys for pulling it off!

Ingredients had to be fresh and good quality. Otherwise, the whole sandwich would've been thrown off. Especially the pork sirloin, that stuff was juicy and delicious and grounded the whole experience in deliciousness!

Definitely coming back once my gut heals from the distension because the size of these tortas are no joke and could trip up a giant!
