A Wonder smokey mesquite smell hits you as soon as you open the door and walk in. 

The price is right and the food is delicious. I've been here 5 times and had food catered once. If you're in the mood for Mexican food... This place is for you. With a large menu you have many choices. 

You owe it to your taste buds to stop here.
