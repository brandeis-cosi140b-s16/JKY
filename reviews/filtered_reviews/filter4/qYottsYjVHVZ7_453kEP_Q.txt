I think this place got a bad rap from the early reviews when they first opened, I say ignore the early reviews and go with the ones from mid 2011 like mine.

We just got back and I must say the place is NOT for healthy eating, no way. We junk fooded ourselves and did the traditional nachos, chicken wings and a Sonoran Hot Dog! Massive calorie overload!, but who eats this every day? A basket of fries were also dropped off with the order, but I guess it pairs with the chicken wings. (When it comes to food, I'm a "common sewer" ha ha!) ***YAY nice thick steak fries, I loved that aspect, the shoestring fries sux!***

The decor is casual and fun, TVs everywere and bar looking for the most part. I was surprised how huge it is inside, the building looks smaller from the outside, but indoors there is plenty of seating. There is a guy making fresh tortillas in the back room and you can see the machine that makes the chips, pretty cool. The machine is made by a company called "Lenin". Hmmm? strange Russian heritage there somewheres.

Oh yeah, I thought this was funny. I see they have $2 Coronas in cans, so I order one. A few minutes later the waitress goes by and litterally drops the can off on the table. "Here's your Corona" as she skampers away. I'm like Whaaaaaaaat? No glass, no lime, not opened, just drop and go! Amazing! I did get some limes and a glass when she passed by again. Funny!

Overall good place and the nachos were not as bad as the previous EARLY reviews makes the place sound. Our traditional nachos didn't have canned cheese on it, although we did have to ask for a side of guacamole and sour cream after we noticed it was missing, but then again it might have been melted all together so that is why it looked it wasn't there. Just ask for some, the bussers are very helpful.

Good place to"junk" yourself out, we'll be back when our cholesterol levels go back down to semi normal. Ha ha!  Seriously, I like it for the most part.
