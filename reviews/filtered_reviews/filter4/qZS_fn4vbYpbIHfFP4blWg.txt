An update is long overdue, since I originally rated Arriba two stars. I've been back a few times since, and they have really made a lot of strides toward improving the food and the service.

The servers are more "on" these days, the food is better, and the overall experience is more satisfying. Tonight I had the Hatch Chicken Especial, which is extraordinarily spicy (it's the spiciest dish they make) and really damned tasty. Pair it with an amber or bock microbrew to temper the spiciness somewhat.
