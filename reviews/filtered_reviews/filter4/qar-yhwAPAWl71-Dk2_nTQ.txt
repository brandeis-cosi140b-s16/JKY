I was staying at the Boulders Resort and wandered over here for dinner. The fish tacos were so yummy and piled high with cabbage, pico and creme. I was full after ordering the chips and salsa- they come with 3 flavors and they are all packing a variety of flavors. The Prickly Pear margarita rocked too! I sat on the rooftop patio with a heat lamp. I enjoyed it here and the food is really good. If I am ever back in Scottsdale this will be a stop I make.
