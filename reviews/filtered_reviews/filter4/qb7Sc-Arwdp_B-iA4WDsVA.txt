Finally tried this place after eyeing it for months! I loved the drinks and the tacos are pretty good. We ordered carne asada,fish and shrimp tacos and my friend got the tamales plate that came with beans on the side and some veggies. The tacos were good a little pricey but other than that good! My friend said the beans were kind of bland and the veggies didn't really go with the plate but she enjoyed her tamales. So over all this place is good the drinks are awesome and the vibe is trendy and chill. I'll be going again for round 2 going to give it another try!
