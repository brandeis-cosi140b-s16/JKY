I've had two meals here, both were tasty. They clearly label their menu indicating gluten-free options. As GF people know, most Mexican food is naturally GF.  But it's nice to know that the kitchen is attempting to eliminate contamination. The location is right next door to Cartel Coffee by the high C gates. They have a seating area and a TV. Carry out business is pretty quick. The salsa comes on the side in containers, red and green. Burrito bowl was flavorful and a good portion size for me.
