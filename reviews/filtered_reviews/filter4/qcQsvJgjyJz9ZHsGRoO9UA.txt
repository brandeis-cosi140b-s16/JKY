Have to say I was very skeptical about "Popo's fiesta del sol" but being that I'm a mexican food adventurer I had to try it.
 1st was seated pretty much right away which generally is a bad sign on a Sunday night (good restaurants are way to busy on Sunday nights)
2nd Chips and salsa right away with a drink order taken within 3-4 minutes of being seated. 
3rd chips and salsa were good although I'm a spicy kind of guy the salsa was ok enough for the kids to eat and for me to enjoy.
 Now, when food arrived in a decent amount of time the presentation was good and the plate was full. I got "El Pollo especial"  and it was OUTSTANDING! 
My daughters got children menu items and they were not so pleased with the ground beef taco (ground beef tacos should be left to taco bell and ajo al's) that's why they get 4 stars instead of 5. All in all the service was good the waitress allowed me to sample the menudo which was PERFECT and I will be back to try it. 
I would recommend this restaurant not for authentic/tex mex/southwest style/sonorran style/ just for good food!
 See you soon Popo's
