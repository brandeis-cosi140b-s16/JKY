QUESO!

Oh yes, the queso. Loco gets extra points for having it as an option as your burrito, chimichanga, enchilada, etc. topping. Other inferior, but still yummy topping sauces include: green tomatillo and citrus chili red sauce.

Next to the queso, what truly sets Loco Lime above the rest for a vegetarian is their selection of options. Instead of rice and beans, their veggie options are filled with sweet plantains, black beans, rice, mixed Mexican cheese, roasted corn relish, Portobello mushrooms, and grilled zucchini. So refreshing to have something different. Those plantains, ahhhh so good.

Also really love the citrus cilantro slaw that is usually served as a side (along with pico de gallo, guacamole, and sour cream). It's light and crunchy and a nice change from shredded iceberg lettuce.

I almost always get the veggie-changa with queso! I highly recommend it!

Nice selection of tequilas and margaritas here, Mondays are half off margaritas. I like the house margarita and the beer-rita. jalapeno margarita is pretty interesting too, but not exactly my cup of tea.

Service here is usually very good, but I've definitely had a couple occasions when my waiter was kinda awful.
