I like this place.  It's a bit over-priced, but there are some pretty good deals on the menu.  I especially like the plates that give you 3 items for about $15.  Their tamales have gone up in price, but they are quite tasty.   The beef burritos are great.  The enchiladas are great.   Their red sauce is spectacular.    I love the salsa they bring with the chips, but I usually got filled up with them before the meal comes which is why I usually split one entree because the plates are large.  A three item plate feeds two.

The worst thing about this place is location.  On two occasions there I have encountered homeless people either sleeping in the parking lot or panhandling.  The place has been there for many years and a high rise condo tower has grown up next door.  The easiest way to get there is while heading south off Las Vegas Blvd., but when you exit take the back street to avoid traffic.  Getting there can be a challenge due to one way streets and heavy traffic on Las Vegas Blvd.  The environment inside is old fashioned kitschy Mexican decor and nothing spectacular.  The layout of the place is atrocious.  You have to walk through the bar to get to the restaurant.  The staff is friendly and attentive.
