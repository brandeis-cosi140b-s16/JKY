Don't just drive past this place! Yes, it looks like your average fast-food-joint-converted-into-Mexican-taco-stand. From the outside.

Go in and you are first greeted by the staff who smile and say hi as they bustle through their food prep (they're also filling drive-thru orders). And you look around--the place has charm. They've put in their own furniture--kind of modified benches/tables that feel like a comfier upgraded fast food set-up. There's some decor, the place has a feel, maybe even some plants. Your senses tell you this is NOT just a taco joint or fast food.  And take a look into the kitchen, which is all open for you to check out. It's shiny, clean and fresh-looking. You're excited about what will come out of there.

I had told my friends that, according to Yelp, the tacos were huge. The guy behind the counter was fixing one up. He saw us staring and held it up for us. He saw the awe in our faces. He smiled and said, 'Half pound of meat." 

We got a variety of tacos in our party  (each of us only needed one). It comes half wrapped in paper like an In&Out burger, and it's good that it does. It's thick and full of juicy stuff piling out the back. I chose the carne asada--pretty awesome. My friends liked the agua frescas, too.

I wish I had a taco joint like this near where I live. I'd make it my regular go-to. The food is lightning fast, but I'd even be tempted to hang out a little.
