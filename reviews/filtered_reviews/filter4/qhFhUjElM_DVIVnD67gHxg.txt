I was actually really impressed today. The chips were nice and crispy. The cheese enchilada was AMAZING. I know what you're thinking. How can you mess up a cheese enchilada? Well, having had some pretty mediocre ones lately, this one really stands out. The sauce was nice and tangy and the cheese was ooey gooey melted perfection. Had a pretty decent margarita too. I sat at the bar during lunch and the service was great and fast. Now, why is it whenever they say the plate is really hot, the first thing I do is grab it? Muy caliente! I highly recommend this place.
