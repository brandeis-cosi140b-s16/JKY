I went here for happy hour drinks and tacos. Drinks were good. I have a few Beers( which a generally good) and their house margarita. I have certainly had better margs other places, but it was by no means bad. Middle of the road. It was however dirt cheap. $2.50. 

Decent Chips, Ok salsa

I order the two tacos with chicken. They came out less than 5 minutes later and the were yummy. They were not worth $7 though. I would say more like $4 MAX.

Overall I will come back here for drinks, maybe get an appetizer. The food was on the more expensive side for what you get. Just an FYI. They have loads of different kinds of tequila. If that is your thing check it out. The place is in a strip mall type place next to the Cox Store, but had a Urban hip-ness on the inside.
