This place was cool but, wow, it was empty on a Friday night!  Not sure what's up with that.  Our group of four enjoyed our time, my wife and I were visiting with friends that we hadn't seen in 10 years so the lack of a crowd was actually a benefit, quieter and no wait.  I went simple and had a Negra Modelo and my dinner order was "Stuffed Peppers" which was excellent.  I would definitely go again as we really enjoyed the food and received excellent service.
