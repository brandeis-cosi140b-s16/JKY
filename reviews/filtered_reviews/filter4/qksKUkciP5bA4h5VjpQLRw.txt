I've been hearing about the "sushi burrito" for a few years now. Up until today, I hadn't had the pleasure of tasting. My friend, she's the one who hear about this place, and I park the car, then approach the building. Not the greatest location of town, but it's around enough restaurants and stores that you don't feel on edge. As we walked in we noticed there was a no eating area outside, something they may want to look into considering the very limited amount of dining in area. Otherwise the restaurant smelled clean, lighting was energy saving, and the staff seemed nice enough. I studied the menu. There are pre-selected types of sushi burritos available (which all sounded amaze balls) or you can build you own, Chipotle style. You can also make it a combo with the salad, chips or mochi. They even allow you to choose between a soy or regular seaweed paper. What blew me away was their option of Taro chips. At the end they have more a variety of choices versus the normal dining area. For example Kern's juice and Aloe Verde was in the fridge. The cashier definitely needed more training.  The sauce bar at then end needs a bigger cup for the stayers. Very good for a week old company, still a lot of room for improvement. Food is excellent though. No fault in that.
