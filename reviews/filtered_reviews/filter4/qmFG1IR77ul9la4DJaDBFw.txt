After following them on Instagram for some time, I decided to pop in for lunch with my son and sister. Right when we walked in, we were pleasantly greeted and asked if it was our first time there. We said yes and she asked if we'd like some meat samples. Whaa?! Yes please! She explained what each meat was and what our meal options were. Because of that I ended up ordering two types of meat instead! The flavor for all the meats were so rich and tasty! I ended up choosing the kalua pig and the pulehu steak in a bowl with a bunch of selections from their toppings bar including the yummy seaweed rice. The portion sizes were great and the quality of the food was perfect for their affordable pricing. We also ordered their "award winning" coconut bark and OMG! It's to die for! I'm not the biggest fan of coconut but this stuff is AMAZING! We ended up ordering another box to take home. I ended up meeting the owner as we were leaving and he was so humble and thankful for our service. We'll definitely be coming back!
