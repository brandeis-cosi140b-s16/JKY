i'm not sure why this place doesn't have a higher rating. I tried this the other weekend for the first time and it was amazing!

Tried: Classic Margarita it was delicious

Queso Chorizo appetizer: another delicious dish

but my absolute favorite thing was the cheese enchilada that I got for my main course.  They bring it out in a mini cast iron pan and instead of rolled enchiladas it was like an enchilada pie and it was sooo amazing I dont even think I swallowed one bite I basically just inhaled it!

Only complaint is that they do NOT take reservations unless you have a party of 8 or more :( seriously?! so either get their early or go late if you want to get in and out. Otherwise expect a wait and have a drink or two at the bar while you wait
