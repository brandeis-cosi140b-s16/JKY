Had a great time a the Tavern.  Liz was our bartender and she was awesome!!! Having lived in New Mexico for 3 years I get the craving every once in a while and decided to come check this place out.  The venue itself is quite surprising as it has water features and a neat decor I wasn't expecting from the strip mall location.  The food was great I enjoyed their green chile, but wished it had been a bit hotter.  I had a sampler type combo dish for dinner, everything was great if I had only one complaint, it would be that I wish I had the choice of pinto or black beans instead of just getting black beans.  The chile was good, as was the salsa, I knocked a half star off for the straight out of the bag chips.  Well worth a visit, and overall 4.5 stars.
