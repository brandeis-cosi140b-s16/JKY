I love this place, and always go back.  Helps that it's right down the street from me. 

Service has always been fast and I've never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for a table.

Food notes:

~ Beans are ok,  my mother in law's are better. (but then, she was born and raised in Mexico! Hard to beat that) 
~ Mango margarita was awesome, but not enough booze in it.
~ I ordered a virgin margarita on their .99 margarita night... turns out they charge you FULL PRICE for a friggin virgin margarita, when I could get a loaded one for a dollar.  I was pretty irked with that.
~ .5 lb carnitas fajitas were amazing... be aware that it's a ton of food and you will likely have lunch and possibly dinner for the next day.
~ Carnitas plate was also humongous.
~ I do like to order the chicken and veggies plate quite a bit.  The veggies are nicely seasoned and well cooked.
