This place is authentic as I have seen in charlotte. We have tried at-least 6 Other Mexican places and so far this is the best. Salsa was really good just a little spice but not so much you can't eat. The chorizo cheese dip was awesome. I got chicken chimichanga and were pretty good. They use shredded chicken but it actually had flavor as was cooked with onions and peppers. My husband got a pork dish and really enjoyed it. He suggested the homemade hot sauce. We topped it off with sopilla which you can't go wrong! Overall was good food. I gave 4 stars because even though service was quick the waiter was not very helpful when we asked for suggestions, just kept saying everything is good. But for a little mom and pop type place not too surprised.  We will return to try more.
