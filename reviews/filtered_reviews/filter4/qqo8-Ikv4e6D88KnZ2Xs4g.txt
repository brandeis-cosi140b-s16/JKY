Shout out to my home Meleah who may read this review (she read ALL my reviews people). lol

TACOS!!!!!! I. LOVE. TACOS! I can have them for breakfast, lunch AND dinner. That's how much I love mexican food. 

Now being in the pregnant state that I am, I have two cravings, watermelon and TACOS. And on my usual monthly night out with these homies (it was my turn to choose) I had to choose this place based on the reviews and pics. 

The appetizer queso joint was good. My homie Meleah asked me what I want in it (perks of pregnancy) and I wanted all the shi*t in it. And guess what... I loved it! Chorizo is a bit salty so make sure you stir that up some. 

I got 5 different tacos... don't ask me which ones. (pregnancy brain)

I just remembered that I I really didn't like the fish taco. It needed some sort of cream on it and it just seemed bland and dry. 

Another taco (can't remember the meat) had too much slaw in it, so that was pretty dry as well. 

Imma go back... 

The service was good. How good?: I'm driving around in circles trying to find a spot to park and my homie told me where she parked so I parked behind her on Kenilworth. (don't park in the garage). Then I'm walking and walking, practically circling the building cuz I'm like "where the sh*t is this place". I guess the dude my friend was speaking to figured I'd be searching for the place, so he came outside to show me the restaurant is that end of the sidewalk, right across from Berrybrook Farms. That was kind, because it was hot as sh*t outside and me and my pregnant a** was about to skip out if I couldn't find the joint. 

Check it out tho... Cheers!
