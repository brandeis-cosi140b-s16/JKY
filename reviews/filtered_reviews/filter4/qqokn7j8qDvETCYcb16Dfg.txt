I'm taking my dad here. 
This place is pretty authentic- made me long for a beach in lareado. 

The Hunny and I had a dozen oysters (not a good choice but not bad any means) 
We downed those with tapatio and fresh lime. 

Then we had ceviche.  So good! I loved it. It was hearty with great lime sauce. 

I had the fish tacos and he had shrimp and fish veracruz or something. 
Both were good- did it taste like the freshest fish of all time? no. 
Did I eat it anyways because it tasted like Baja California. Yup. 

I really like this place. 
They also have the fat boy's favorite mexican beer- bohemia.
