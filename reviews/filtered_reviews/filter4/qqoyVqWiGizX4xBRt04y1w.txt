We usually stay at Mandalay Bay and so when we're not in the mood for gorging at another buffet, Border Grill is a great alternative.   It really helps that Border Grill offers certificates on restaurant.com.   We usually use the $25 off of $50 coupon.  This makes a very good meal  1/2 price here!  We've had the Oaxacan Steak and actually liked the flavors better than a much more expensive steak that we had at the glitzy steak restaurant downstairs, Strip Steak.   The atmosphere at Border Grill is also much more down to earth than other restaurants.  Once inside the restaurant, you blissfully feel like you've left Las Vegas and the casinos behind.  And sometimes, that's a very good thing!
