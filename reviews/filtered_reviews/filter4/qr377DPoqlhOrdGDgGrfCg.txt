Was a little hesitant since the reviews avg a 3, but I give it a 4. 
You have to get the guacamole made fresh at your table side. We asked for it spicy, and it still could have been hotter, but oh my, it was delicious! 
The chips were ok, but I did not like either of the salsas they put on the table.  This is why I can't give them a 5. 
I ordered the 3 chimichanga appetizer and it was good...especially the beef one. However it came with little diced onions all over it, so be warned if you don't like raw onions. The menu didn't say onions, so I did have the opportunity to say hold them. Now you do!  ;)
