If you can get past the naughty name, you will find a casual, fun, festive, Tex-Mex  joint. The walls are painted in bright colors and there is folkart everywhere. The Pink Taco serves up standard fare such as burritos, tacos, and quesadillas--some with a twist. I had the namesake Pink Taco (Panuchos) which has black beans, avacado, pickled onions, grilled chicken and salsa roja. They were pretty tasty, especially with the margaritas to wash them down. 

Pink Taco has great happy hour specials with 2 for 1 beers and margaritas and half price appetizers. This is a great place to unwind with friends.
