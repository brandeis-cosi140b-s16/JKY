I've been eyeing KoMex since summer of 2012 and I finally got to try this past trip. Better late than never. 
Even though it's a bit of a drive from the strip, I am so glad we made it out (then again I wasn't the one driving... Thank you P!) 
As per many yelpers' recommendation, we tried bulgogi nachos (with kimchi on the side), Fusion Flautas, and spicy pork kimchi fried rice. 
I love Korean Mexican fusion. So. Good.
We order the half size bulgogi nachos and that was plenty for the two of us. Their home made chips were great and they were not stingy with the toppings. I could eat this all day long.
The flautas were also delicious. Bulgogi plus cheese rolled in flour tortillas and deep fried. What more could you ask? Gucamole you said? Yes, they come with the flautas and were fresh and excellent! We were really full already by the time the fried rice arrived at our table. I had a couple bites, but the flautas definitely had my heart. My friend though on the other hand couldn't stop eating the fried rice even though he was really full. 
They also have 4 different kind of salsa. I only got to try 3 of them because I was too busy stuffing my face with everything else. The green one was alright. Not too memorable. But the other two that I tried were amazing. One of them kind of remind me of the sauce Kogi truck uses. It has a nice balance of vinegary and spiciness, except the one here has an extra kick at the end. The kick at the end is pretty strong. The other one is on the sweet side, and if I could I would steal their salsa home. Remember to grab the salsa containers when your complementary tortilla chips arrived!
