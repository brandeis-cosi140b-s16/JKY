My first experience there was terrible, but this is a great company and they made it right for us in a big way. We were treated like VIP's the second time around and the food was awesome. I can't think of better Mexican food that I've ever had. It is still a little pricey I think, but this is a capitalist country right. They can charge what they want if the food is great and it is.
