Had the $35 unlimited tapas brunch. Two "loves" & one "not so much." Creative combos: loved the Benedict but the egg was very under cooked. Shrimp and grits were tasty. Fig & cheese quesadilla was great. Lobster pancakes (well my bad for thinking that was a good combo...it tasted a lot like it sounds.) Nice finish with bread pudding French toast. The pineapple margarita with vanilla infused tequila was a great choice. It's a nice splurge but won't be a regular stop.
