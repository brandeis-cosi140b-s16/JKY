My husband and I enjoyed a casual meal at the bar right off the casino floor in Treasure Island.  The hotel gives out a buy one get one drink for this restaurant when you check in and we sure weren't going to let that go to waste.  The margaritas were a little too heavy on the ice but were decent.  The chips and salsa are very good as the other reviews state.

I had the shrimp guacomole salad that is almost like a slaw and a little texturally unusual but good.  My husband had the enchiladas and they were quite good as well.  Nothing too extraordinary but good and a good way to kick off a weekend of alcohol consumption.
