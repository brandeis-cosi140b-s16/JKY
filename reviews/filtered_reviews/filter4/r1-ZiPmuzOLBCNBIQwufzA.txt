This place is not your average Mexican restaurant. The place has a collection of different furniture the menu is simple and the food is first rate. i like the different salsa's that you can order. The staff needs a little training on customer service, a little disorganized, but not enough to keep us from going back. This is a great addition to our neighborhood
