Delicious!

Went here for a work dinner, and started off with a Mojito. Handmade in front of me, very good. Non of that pre-made mix crap!

Salsa and chips are excellent, we did not order appetizers though the guac, and croquets sounded amazing!

I ordered a steak burrito, with the queso on top...Um muy bueno!
The burrito was warm, with a thick tortilla, and I was surprised to even find peas in it! The queso on top was a lovely creamy addition, and there was plenty of side items, lettuce, tomato, guac, sour cream if you needed them. Also on the side was their coleslaw, this stuff is amazing, I absolutely loved it.

I will definately be back soon!
