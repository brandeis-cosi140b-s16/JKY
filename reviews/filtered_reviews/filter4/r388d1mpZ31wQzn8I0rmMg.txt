I was there when this place first opened! 

For my own selfish reasons I enjoyed the first few months when there weren't crowds, lol! Still, even now, after everyone found out how delicious it is & started living there, it's high on my list of best places for happy hour & dinner. 

I can't get enough of their guacamole & my favorite main dish is definitely the Tia's Enchiladas with green tomatillo sauce,,,,,, mouth watering!
