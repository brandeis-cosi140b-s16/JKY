Authentic and super tasty street tacos. The line is a little daunting but the staff is friendly and the food is fantastic. Our group tried quesadillas, 3 types of tacos, and Mulas and everything was delicious.


The place was super clean. The lines looked long but moved super fast. Great place to grab a quick bite heading to or from the strip.
