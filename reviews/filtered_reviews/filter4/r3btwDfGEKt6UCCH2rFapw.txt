So I went here for the first time today I'm new to AZ been desperately trying to find decent Mexican food since I moved here I came to the right spot the flavor was amazing the food was to die for I'm very picky about the way Mexican food is cooked and there were no complaints I do wish the server was more helpful with the menu recommending choices since it was my first time but she got all the food out in a timely manner I will definitely be returning
