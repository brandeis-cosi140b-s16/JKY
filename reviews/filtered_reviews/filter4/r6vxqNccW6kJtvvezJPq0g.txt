I couldn't give this less than 4 stars because it's a beautiful stunning restaurant--including the cute waitress outfits. Prices a little high, food pretty good, chips & salsa excellent. We eat here on Monday evenings when seniors get half price-then it's a great deal!

(Silverton is my favorite "locals" casino to bring visitors to because of the d√©cor, the fish tanks & Bass Pro Shops.)
