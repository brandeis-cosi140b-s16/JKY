My burning question after walking out the door of Barrio Cafe on a Thursday afternoon was "was it overpriced?" That appears to be several other reviewers' issue with this place, and I'll answer that right up front: NO.

Firstly, it's not Tex Mex, New Mexican or Sonoran style Mexi food. It's classic, middle of Mexico style with appropriate innovations or surprises that really are worth stepping out of the tradition (i.e., craisans in the guac).

Which brings me to the other highly debated Yelp issue -- $11 guacamole. We came for lunch, so did not get the table side presentation, so right off that seems like a bust on the price. However, it was fucking tasty. I don't know, stuff that like normally infuriates me, but I did not think it was out of place here. The chips that came with it were awesome. Handmade, thicker tortilla pieces that weren't too greasy.

The service was great and unlike other reviewers, we had zilch wait. Here's the thing, if you really want to try this place and know there's a crazy long wait, suck it up and wait and don't complain about it, don't go on a Friday night, don't go at all, or try to go when is likely to be less busy, like a weekday lunch or early dinner. 

I loved my cochinta pibil street tacos. The slow roasted pork was rad, the cotija cheese wonderful and the optional fries were a fun touch (i was not a fan of either sauce that came with them, some sort of spicy chipotle ketchup and a weird mustard). My sister was not in love with her poblano chile torta. It was oozing with cheese and she didn't think it had a "meaty" quality to make for a good sandwich. The bread it came out on, a crusty French loaf, was an interesting touch and good. 

Would I come back? Yes. Would I tell others to go? Absolutely. Will I go on a Saturday night? No. I hate waiting an hour for a table so will go when I don't have to do that. Problem solved.
