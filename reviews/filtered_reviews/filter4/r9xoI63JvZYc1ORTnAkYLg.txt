This place is delicious and our bartender (Griffin, I believe) was great. Chill but on point with service. We were staying at the Golden Nugget and visited this place 3 times in a 24 hour period. Had 2 different kinds of nachos, breakfast taco, huevos rancheros and lots of beer! Definitely our go to place from now on!
