my type of place, the decor is awesome, the food was tasteful, and the service was really fast.

I ordered nachos from the appetizer menu and they large enough for a meal. The margaritas aren't crazy large, but they are large enough to get you loose. If your attending any venues nearby this is a nice lowkey restaurant that's much larger then it looks on the outside.
