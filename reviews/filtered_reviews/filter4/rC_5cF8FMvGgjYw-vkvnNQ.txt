Any place that offers a well-executed bacon shake is worth trying.  I didn't even know that before I ate at PV Burger the first time, so it was a nice surprise.

My first visit, I went with the Brulee Burger.  It was OK.  Second visit, I had the Philly Burger daily special, which had two tempura-battered patties, cream cheese, and a couple other things.  The Philly Burger was pretty tasty, and maybe a step above their signature brulee burger.

The fries are pedestrian, but I haven't had any other sides.  Prices are a little steep here, and I like getting a shake, so now I tend to stick with just a burger and a shake just to keep my financial and caloric budgets under control.

I already mentioned the shakes.  I was skeptical of the bacon shake after the miserable bacon soda experience I had last year, but this bacon shake is done well.  It tastes like bacon, but it's not to strong.  And best of all, it has actually crunchy - and some fatty - pieces of bacon in it.  As edible as the bacon shake was, however, I would recommend the Lucky Charms Marshmallow shake first.  I think the bacon shake would need some maple in it to make it a contest.

PV Burger Co are artists.  They have really interesting ideas, and they execute it well.  It could be better, though.  They can't draw people by the quality of their meat alone, like some of the more high-end burger spots.  Drink selection is weak; a place like this really needs to serve some specialty bottled sodas, or at least something besides canned Coke products.

As it stands, though, PV Burger is an excellent neighborhood burger joint, and is probably even worth traveling a few miles out of your way to visit.  The bacon is calling for you.
