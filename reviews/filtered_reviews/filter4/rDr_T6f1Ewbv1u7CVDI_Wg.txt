I love this place. They give large portions so you don't feel ripped off at all. The chips are the BEST. They are open late (until 10:00) and I like that. They have a few employee's who have a bad attitude, but they are not really rude, so it doesn't really bother me. The price is good for the amount of food you get. I can never finish my meal, so my leftovers make a great lunch the next day. It is a somewhat healthy meal for a good price. Worth checking out!
