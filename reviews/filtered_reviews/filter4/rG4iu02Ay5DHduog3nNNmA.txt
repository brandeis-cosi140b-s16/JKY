As a vegetarian, it is difficult find Mexican food (although this really is more Central American) that does not have animal products in the rice, beans, and sauces. Not only is it veggie friendly but the food is excellent. If there were a few more choices on the menu I would give it 5 stars. I would recommend this place to anyone.
