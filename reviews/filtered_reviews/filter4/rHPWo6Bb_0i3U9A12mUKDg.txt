We ordered from here for my wife's dissertation defense and it hit the spot! 

We ordered 10 chicken flautas, 10 tacos dorados, and 10 tacos (beef n chicken) plus some chips n guacamole. They were prepared with care and hot. The sides were individually packed. And the chili and quac tasted just like grandma used to make. 

While they don't have a catering menu - they are definitely worth ordering from for your next party!

When I went to pick up the order I was surprised to see that they totally remodeled and the back of the restaurant was bigger! 

We will be back no doubt!
