So I have completely been MIA lately! It makes me sad, and I realized that I haven't not been going to as many new places or seeing new sites without Yelp's guidance! So this is my return.

Old Town Tortilla Factory was a-ok in my books! I had the enchilada and it was truly delicious. It was almost tex-mex and not truly a "mexican" enchilda, but it was still tasty! The sauce had just the right amount of kick, the tortilla appetizer was delicious, and our server was friendly and gave us space. I'd definitely recommend it as long as you keep in mind that it's not TRULY mexican food...

The only thing I would change? It was cold and windy and the heater wasn't close enough to our table to really warm things up ... but if that's my only complaint it wasn't too shabby. :)
