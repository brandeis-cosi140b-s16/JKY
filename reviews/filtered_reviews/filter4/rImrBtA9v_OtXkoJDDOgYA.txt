I had them many moons ago, in Encanitas, on a surf trip. Yummy tacos! It was nice to see them in Vegas. I had a salad and I think I love the tacos more. I think that grilled shrimp platter will be worth trying the next time. The bar looks fun to sit at. I'm not really one to drink at restaurant bars, but I like how it's 'outside' and still inside. You'll have to see it to understand what I mean. Good stuff.
