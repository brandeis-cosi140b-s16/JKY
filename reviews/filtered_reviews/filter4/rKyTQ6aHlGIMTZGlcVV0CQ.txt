Tucked in the corner of a fry's strip mall - a 1980s type of Mexican food sit down joint that is family owned and family run. Hav been there a dozen times or so and have enjoyed it every time. The goyo burrito is pretty dang good - the a bean and cheese with a requested green chili add in is dang nice too. Good rice. Great red sauce. Fun to be there, family ran.
