Great customer service and good food!  I had the olivier salad, red borscht, chicken kiev, and napoleon cake.   The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 was that I wasn't really a fan of the kiev.  The kiev reminded me of fried chicken and was a bit dry and lacking in flavor in my opinion.  But everything else was really good.  I would like to go back and try the other dishes.
