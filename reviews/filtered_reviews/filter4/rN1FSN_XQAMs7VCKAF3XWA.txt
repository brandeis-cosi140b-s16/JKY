This is one of my favorite restaurants to visit when I'm craving some good and fresh tasting New Mexican specialties. The flavors are out of this world and it will make your mouth dance with joy.

Been to their other restaurants many times and always enjoy coming back. First got to experience this kind of treat at their older restaurant that mysteriously caught on fire. This place is a favorite of my boss and he usually pays. Nice!

Love the Chimayo Chicken and on other visits order one of the Fish Specials written on the board. The appetizers are delicious and you can easily get filled up on them quickly. Really enjoyed the Green Chili French Onion Soup on my last visit. It had the perfect amount of heat for me and made me break a sweat.

Service can be somewhat mediocre at times. Make sure to also bring a flashlight or have your smart phone app ready to go. It is ridiculously dark in there and can create a bit of a problem. You can always choose to eat outside at the bar or at one of the smaller tables.

This is not a cheap and inexpensive dining experience. Then again it is not super duper crazy expensive. They do have valet parking at certain times so don't be surprised.

Give them a shout out and get ready for some yummy flavors. You won't be disappointed. TOUCHDOWN IN MY MOUTH!
