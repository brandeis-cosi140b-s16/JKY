If this place was being rated on the atmosphere alone it would be 5 stars.  The service was great and the food ranged from average to really good.  The prices are to me a bit high for the quality of food.  Recently I have had a chance to eat at several low cost, very high quality family owned Mexican food resturants.  I must say.. the very very best foods come from the most unexpected places.
