You have to walk north of the strip pass the Wynn and Encore but trust me it is worth it. I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I did, but the carne asada tacos were amazing.  I had the tripe and spicy pork tacos as well, on a full stomach and it was still delicious and authentic.  For 2 dollars a piece, the size was perfect, and if you are walking down the strip you might as find this little mom and pops place.  The lines are long but they go pretty fast.  It is the right amount of spice and flavor.
