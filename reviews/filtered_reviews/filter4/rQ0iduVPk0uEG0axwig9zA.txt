Mexican Food Done Right


My co-worker and I decided we wanted authentic Mexican food for lunch and after reading reviews for Rosita's we headed down to 24th Street and McDowell for lunch.

Rosita's isn't one of those typical  fancy chain "Mexican Gourmet" restaurants.  Rosita's is the real deal and the folks at Rosita's are doing "Mexican Food" up right.

As we entered the restaurant we sat ourselves at a table.  Our server took our drink order and brought us a huge basket  of chips and salsa.  The chips at Rosita's are made fresh to order and served sizzling hot. These chips are thin, crispy, lightly salted, and absolutely delicious. I could have easily ate the entire basket but needed to save room for our lunch entr√©e's. 

Usually when I dine at a Mexican Restaurant  I order a machaca burrito enchilada style, so there is no telling how many machaca burritos enchilada style  I've earen over the years. So, today was no diffrent. I had the machaca beef burrito enchilada style and it was delicious. One of the best machaca burritos I've even eaten.

The machaca was moist, tender, and full of flavor.   My tastebuds were in heaven. Not only was my burrito delicious,  the serving was large, and I mean very large.  I couldn't even finish half my burrito. 

 Everything we tried was unbelievably tasty. From the  machaca burrito, chicken mole, green chili tamale, to the guacamole & beans each dish was absolutely delicious.

If your ever in the area, stop by Rosita's you will not be disappointed.
