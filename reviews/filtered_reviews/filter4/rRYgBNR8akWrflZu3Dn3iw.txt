This food is fabulous!  The service is on point!  The owner is a really engaging guy that gets what people want.  I get the chicken salad with the ginger dressing, it's stellar!   If you are looking for a quick tasty meal this will do the trick!  I gave 4 stars and would have given five if the fish wasn't  kept in a butter/ oil looking substance.  I know it adds flavor but I prefer to add the calories I want.  I know that most people aren't as worried about the calories.
