O KoMex, what a fantastic fusion feast 
from this oasis to my east.
Since I live on the west coast,
I do not mean to boast
but I wanted to explain my positioning in the least.

The fusion of cultures and foods were actually above par.
When mixing Bulgogi and Flautas, it was great and bazar.
But the place settings were were decorated with folklore from China,
which is something I'd expect in South Carolina;
I don't think they really know who they are.

Mexican, Korean, and a little Chinese,
with food so great it brought me to my knees.
Though I would be remiss if I forgot to mention their sauce,
it was their winning combination that made them so boss.
I will always accept your fusion guac with a thank you and please.

The wait staff was nice,
they accommodated our vegetarian not once, but twice.
Was it the greatest? I do not think so,
but I'd highly recommend that you all go.
This is one place in Vegas you won't need to roll the dice...
