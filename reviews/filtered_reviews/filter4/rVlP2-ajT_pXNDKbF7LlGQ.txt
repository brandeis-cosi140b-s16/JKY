"Aloha!" 
LOL. Oh bah...! I know Vegas is considered the ninth island, but no need greet me as if we were actually in Hawaii. Slightly kidding! 
Went here to pick up some early lunch with the sister before I had to work today, and I had a mean craving for some Hawaiian flavors, and I Yelped this place. 
Walking in, we were greeted right away. The entire staff was friendly. The first guy we talked to was all-around friendly, and noticed that I could've been a newbie, so he offered me samples of the meat (steak, Kalua Pig, and Huli Huli Chicken). All good. 
You order your stuff (burrito, tacos, nachos, salad or bowl) the way you want down the line. Anyway, I had the bowl with brown rice and Kalua Pig, and my sister had ordered herself and our dad Kalua Pig and steak burritos. Yup... The meat satisfied my cravings. The bowl looked like a small container, but they loaded it, so now I'm going to devour the rest of that meal for my dinner. The sister was also kind enough to share her burrito 'cause it was huge and loaded, even though she didn't ask for a lot of toppings to go with the rice and meat. 
Did I mention that the guys that were working were nice? Didn't even pressure me for a tip to add to the total when he flipped the register screen. Hahaha... I had to ask if it was okay to add it on since I didn't have cash. If they get busy, no worries 'cause they multi-task pretty good. 
Alright. I know where to go around home for some Hawaiian flavors fusion style.
