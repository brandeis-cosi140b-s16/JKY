Not the best food on the strip so why the four stars you ask?  Service.  By seven to eight o'clock at night, the place was packed.  Our waiter Billy hustled big time to get our drinks to the table and even check up on us.  This place is a dive bar/restaurant.  Yes they are a business but when it comes to an establishment catering to drunk college kids, do you really think you will get a five star dining experience?  Be prepared to wait for a table or even book a reservation.  Bring tons of friends and a fun attitude and I'm sure you will have a great time.  The food is actually good.  I had the pulled pork burger and our table ordered the nachos.  Both really good in taste and temperature.  I don't think they ever have a slow time.  Be patient, have fun and drink lots!
