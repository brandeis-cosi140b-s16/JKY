Solid effort from Upscale Projects. Not "authentic" Mexican, per se, but really good takes on tacos, enchiladas and sides. Great craft beer menu, much like Federal Pizza next door. Pleasant & upbeat servers. A bit pricey for street tacos but $2 Taco Tuesday is the cure for that. We had the Standard, Pork Adobado, a couple of Crispy Fish and Carnitas tacos, as well as a chicken enchilada. Tacos are creative builds and flavorful. We'll be back.
