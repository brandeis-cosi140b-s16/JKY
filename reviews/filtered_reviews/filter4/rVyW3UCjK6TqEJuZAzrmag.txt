I went to Viva Mercado's during my lunch break. I was seated near the bar and kitchen entrance and the waitstaff quickly came by to take my order and brought complimentary chips, salsa and refried beans. I ordered one of their lunch combos with a carne asada taco and a grilled fish taco. My first thought when I bit into the carne asada taco was, "THAT'S how asada should be." A nicely-seared beef with a flavorful marinade. The fish taco was sitting on some pico de gallo so the tortilla got quite soggy. It paled in comparison to the carne asada. 

The food was affordable and my server, even though seemed pretty busy, was friendly and attentive. This location used to be occupied by some other sad Mexican restaurant that failed. I'm glad Viva Mercado's took over and hope for their continued success.
