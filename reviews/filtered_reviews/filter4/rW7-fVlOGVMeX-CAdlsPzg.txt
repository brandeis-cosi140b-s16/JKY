It was in the casino of the Aria and was fun! We weren't super hungry but wanted a place we could dress up, have great margaritas and snacky foods. Everything we wanted! The decor was interesting, kinda cool but kinda weird too. Service was great and the cocktails were awesome. Huge menu but we really just gorged on chips, yummy salsa and the ceviche trio. 

Tip: if you like chorizo/cheesy queso fundido, this one disappoints. WAY too cheesy, no sausage/chorizo/ground meat like I enjoy (and use when I make) and it felt like a throwaway dish.
