I love this place! I moved here from Anaheim CA about two years ago and I was having a horrible experience finding a Mexican or torta or taco place because most Mexican places I went here in Phoenix is "Sonoran"  or "northern" style cuisine. They make tortas just like the ones in the D.F. city or Cuernavaca Morelos!!! In addition they have Esquimos, which I love (it's a drink) so I've been coming to place at least once a month. It is in a small location parking and wait time is horrible, but we'll worth the wait, that's why I put 4 abd not 5, they NEED a bigger location.  The outside is not very attractive, I almost didn't go in, there's usually a waiting time to be seated. They make the food fresh so it also takes a while. Do not go when your starving because, it does take time! They also gave a "kids menu" the portions on those are a bit big in my 4yr niece only eats 1/4 to 1/2. The tortas comes with "chips" aka ruffle looking salted potato chips like regular lays, or a salad consisting of lettuce and a couple of cucumber slides. I loved that this they served the salad with cut lime, ( just like my mother, they must be from the same place) no dressing so I don't have to worry about telling "NO DRESSING". If you do go, try one of their delicious natural fruit water, they also have fresh juices.
