Whoa... strong margaritas. That is my main impression when I left. I can seriously appreciate this after a hard day and having gone to other places which charge the same and feel like I just paid for some watered down margarita mix. These? Tasty... effective. Yessssss....

The atmosphere of this place is pretty cozy with it's dim lighting and large booths. Prices were reasonable and the service was friendly. I ordered the Enchiladas de Chile Relleno and while there wasn't anything about them that stood out, they were delicious all the same.

I absolutely plan on going back and trying more off the menu. An update shall come then.
