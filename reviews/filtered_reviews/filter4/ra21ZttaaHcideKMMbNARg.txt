Four Stars... Not for the tacos themselves... But for the SALSA BAR!!! 
I still think TACOS EL GORDO has THE best tacos but this place wasnt bad. 
They have ADOBADA too but I guess it is called AL PASTOR here. I just didnt feel like it was as flavorful at El Gordo.
The salsa bar is the shizzznit though! Nom nom. Like six different kinds of salsa, i could just eat them with a spoon! 
Good prices on everything and they have A LOT more food options like burritos, rice bowls, tacos, corn... My first time having Mexican Style corn too! The corn was cooked perfectly! Crunchy yet sweet, not mushy... As for the flavorings it was MEH. It could have used MORE flavor but I would still order this again just cuz!
