We shared a taco "sampler" of one of each of their tacos. The halibut taco was the standout fave for me, though they were all good. My prickly pear margarita was fruity and not made from a sickly sweet mix, as far as I could tell. The elote was addictive. We had attentive, effective service. Pricing was such as I'd expect for a resto. in a boutique hotel. Really no complaints at all. 

I just had to laugh when I read Yelp reviews that gave me the impression this place might be a little too cool for the likes me. I thought it was kinda more a post-modern upscale junkstore aesthetic. I LOVED it. It was very casual and not stuffy at all! The hand dryers in the bathroom are worth a trip to the potty, too.
