I went here once...totally didn't know what to expect.  For such a small place I expected the worst.  All I can say is it was surprisingly good.  The corn on the cob covered in cheese looked like a nightmare but it was the best thing I've had in a long time.  Carne asada was also really, really good.  Salsas and guacamole were nice and fresh.  Overall a great find.  Will for sure be back again and again...am anticipating the opening of the new location so I don't have to drive so far.
