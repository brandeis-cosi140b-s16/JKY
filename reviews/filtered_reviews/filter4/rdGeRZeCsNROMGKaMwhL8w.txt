My friends and I love las Velas as an after work spot! It's a small Mexican restaurant that sits somewhat hidden on a second floor space in market square, and if you can stand the trek up the flight of stairs then it's worth it!  For the prices they offer, you can't beat it.  The queso is ridiculous, and I love the chicken quesadilla (my go to). I highly recommend trying Las Velas if you're looking for good, quality food, but not looking to spend your life savings on dinner!
