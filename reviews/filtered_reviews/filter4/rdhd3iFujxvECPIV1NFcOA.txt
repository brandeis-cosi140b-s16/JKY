Authentico y delicioso! Backyard Taco was an absolutely delicious treat! The carne asada (steak) quesadilla was just the right amount of portion for one person. The only reason I gave four stars was because it doesn't list what actually comes in the quesadilla i.e., carne asada, lettuce, cojita cheese and onions. A person that is allergic to onions needs to know this ahead of time. Now that I know? I will definitely be returning for that authentic backyard Mexican style!
