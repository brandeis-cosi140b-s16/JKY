Still one of the best happy hours around! Half price (delicious) appetizers. More to choose from than a bunch of fried appetizers!  My favorites are the Shrimp & Guacamole Bites and the Street Tacos.

Margaritas are always good! Bartenders are super busy but still always friendly, smiling and having a great time. Plus, happy hour is in the entire restaurant, not just the bar area, don't see that much anymore.
