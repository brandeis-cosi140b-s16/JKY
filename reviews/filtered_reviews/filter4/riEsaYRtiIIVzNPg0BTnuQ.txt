After walking in and stopping to look at at the menu we were asked if it was our first time there.  It was, and we were offered several samples of their top sellers.  Because my gf and I like spicy she brought us some samples of the Diablo Pollo from the kitchen.  Everything we tried was good.  I got the Emerald chicken in a quesadilla and the jade red chick outside, jerk fried rice, and the black beans.    The Emerald chicken quesadilla was a great recommendation. The green onions make the flavor pop.  

2 stars for the great and friendly service.  The chance to try the different dishes before ordering was great and the staff members seemed super nice.  

1 stars for the taste of the food.  It met my expectations

1 star for the price.  It seemed a little pricey for what it is.  The servings seem small for the price, but still was a sufficient serving for me.  

Definitely worth trying if you have not.
