I thought the food was pretty good for being a restaurant inside an airport. we were happy to find a decent sit down establishment while we waited for our flight. I Had the chicken cobo basically chicken tenders with fries and it was pretty good. I didn't care for the coffee it tasted weired. My wife had the burger which she thought was good.
