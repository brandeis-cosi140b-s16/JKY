Located in Planet Hollywood. Came here twice while in Vegas! The happy hour is AWESOME! I tried guac and chips (so many chips!) and the quesadilla (comes with the option to add onions and peppers- I suggest that). Both were amazing and just $5! $5 also can buy you an excellent frozen or on the rocks margarita (any flavor you want). Came back the next day and tried the chicken fajitas (comes with all the fixins and it was amazing). Had a bite of my friends ceviche- it was okkkkay. Not very fresh tasting but I still enjoyed it. Also it was very spicy. Everything else is awesome! Shout out to Niko for being the best bartender!
