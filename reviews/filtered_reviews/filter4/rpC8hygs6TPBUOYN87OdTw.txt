Ok, yelp. Found this place thanks to your app on my droid. Looking for "mexican" and stumbled upon this place having 200+ views. Waltzed in with my sis and was immediately confused. Rice bowls... items resembling orange chicken. "wtf", i stammered as i looked over at my sister... puzzled. We made our way over to the "sample" area where a cute boy... no older than 20 helped us out with understanding the mexican, chinese, jamacian menu and let us try some yummy samples.

Jade Chicken. Striking similar to orange chicken... but I had mine in a quesadilla.. with  spicy black beans. Yum. 

Definitely a laid back, "hole in the wall" esque place... its delicious, the staff is uber friendly, its clean, and HELLO.. the food is delicious.

 Next time I get the urge to deviate from my diet, you'll find me at Chino Bandido... elbow deep in some good grub.
