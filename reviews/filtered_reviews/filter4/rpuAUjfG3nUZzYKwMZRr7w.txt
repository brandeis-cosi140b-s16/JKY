Yummy Yummy, get in my Tummy!  This place was awesome!  So my lady and I were craving some Mexican food and were thinking about Carolina's, or Most Wanted Taco Shop. Well my brother recommended Gadzook's so we wanted to give it a try.  I'm glad we did.  This place was amazing!  We ordered some taco's and enchiladas.  We sampled the three different meats, short rib, green chile pork and chicken.  All the meats were braised and had were super flavorful.  The concept is a lot like Chipotle or Cafe Rio, but the food was a lot more tasteful.  You'll notice the difference when you sample their meats.  You order from the counter and they make your food right in front of you.  A lot of different options, with their sauces, cheeses, and salsa's.

In conclusion, if you like Chipotle, please give this place a try.  It blows Chipotle out of the water!  I'm a little upset I didn't find this place sooner.  I highly recommend and will be going back soon!
