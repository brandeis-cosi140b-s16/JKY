Okay I always compare this place to Chipotle. Its kind of the same concept, but way more variety. All in all this place is great, but it does NOT feel as healthy as chipotle does ;) haha. What is great is the tortillas (freshly made and MUCH MUCH better), the beans, and the guac is different not better but delicious!

Tips on ordering, I love the sweet pork. its good in a burrito, in a salad etc. I know my friends like the green chile beef which is also good. You know what is great? The fact that they have taco tuesday for 1.50 tacos. Umm wow. you cant get the steak though, its not on the deal. but get one of everything if you can fit it in ya!

The tortillas are the best part. really.
