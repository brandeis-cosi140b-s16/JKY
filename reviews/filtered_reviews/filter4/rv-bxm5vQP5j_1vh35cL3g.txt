The menu is awesome, with a few surprise options.  The atmosphere was traditional authentic Mexican restaurant.  Very reasonably priced.  Margaritas were awesome and sooooo inexpensive.  Overall it was a great dinner.  The bathroom was TINY, but I didn't plan to spend much time in there.  I will for sure be back!
