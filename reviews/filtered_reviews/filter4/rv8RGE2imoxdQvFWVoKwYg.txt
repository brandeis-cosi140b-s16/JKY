If you're looking to eat and not spend what slot machine money you have left...try Tequila Bar and Grill.  It's not fancy, but you can get a ton of food for cheap.
We split the 1/2 beef nachos and had over half left.  I think it was around $13 for the nachos, which came with 3 big street tacos.  A pitcher of beer was $9.  A great deal, especially if you're on the strip and don't want to shell out a bunch of money on something quick to eat.
Chips were crispy, they used real cheese, guac was fresh (not brown), salsa was tasty.
Give it a go.
