I have stopped getting horrified at prices of any establishment inside a Las Vegas strip hotel. Yes China Poblano is a bit overpriced in the general scheme of things, but for its kind, fairly normal. 

Came here for some food before heading into Marquee, since it's right in front of the club. We weren't too hungry but, kids, lots and lots of liquor on an empty stomach = wishing you were dead the next morning. So, light meals. I got the traditional siu mai and my friend got the queso fundido.

Let me remind you that I was (mostly) sober at this point.

The siu mai was bomb. Maybe I hadn't had siu mai for a while and really missed it. Maybe very slight intoxication made it yummier. Who knows? But I thought it was great. So great in fact that the day before the trip ended, I just had to come back.

And yes, it was still good the second time around (and totally sober this time). Plus they had a dish called Like Water for Chocolate. Come on. Bookworm that I was, I could not resist. And yes it was good. Dragonfruit and rose petals and quail! Exotic and delicious.

I'd definitely go back.
