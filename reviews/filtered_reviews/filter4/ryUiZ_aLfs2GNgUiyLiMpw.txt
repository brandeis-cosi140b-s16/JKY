A couple weeks ago, I took the wifey to Tacos El Gordo and got her hooked on al pastor. Ever since then, she's wanting to try more and more taco spots with me. Yeah, I know...awesome, right?! Taco Tijuana came up on Talk a while back and we decided to hit it up. It's a small joint located right off Eastern & Trop. I imagine it gets busy in here at times and much like TEG, you might have trouble finding a seat during their peak times. 

I ordered a couple adobada tacos and an asada taco. The asada had great flavor and was spicier than most I've tried, but it was slightly dry. I came here mainly for the adobada though and that's where the money's at. It's a bit greasier then I'm used to but I think that only adds to the overall taco goodness. It is extremely moist and tender, a bit spicier than most and like the asada, these guys really pack some meat on for $2! About the only thing I didn't like about it was the pineapple. I dig the pineapple sweetness with the spicy pork but if you look at the picture, they kinda just slap a big square stick of it on the taco. I prefer the smaller chunks but I'm sure that can be requested. 

They also have really great customer service. Everyone was friendly and the restaurant was organized and clean. The lack of a salsa bar is a bit disappointing but since the tacos were on point, it's not a huge deal. If you're in the area, Taco Tijuana is definitely worth a stop!
