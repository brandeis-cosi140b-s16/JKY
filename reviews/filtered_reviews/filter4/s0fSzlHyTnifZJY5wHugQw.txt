Vegas finally got a sushi burrito place! 

I got the Rockport with soy paper but subbed shrimp tempura for soft shell crab and subbed salmon for spicy tuna. It was really delicious! My only complaint was the sauces was only on one-side of the burrito so the parts without the sauces were kind of bland. I may also try it with seaweed instead of soy paper next time. Also I wish they have unagi as one of the choices, please add it to your menu! 

The setup is like Chipotle, however, the line was moving kind of slow when I went. I understand that they just opened and have to train the employees as some of them still have to look at the cheat sheet for what ingredients goes into each burrito. I expect the line to move faster once they are more familiar with the products.
