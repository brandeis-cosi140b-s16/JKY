Solid choice for dining on the strip :)

It's a bit expensive overall, but that's pretty much the only thing I can complain about here!  We received great service, the setting was very dim and romantic, and the food overall was good!

Started off with the Complimentary Chips and Salsa. So easy to get this wrong...but Javier's does it right!   

Ceviche de Camaron ($18). Great ceviche...just spendy. Some of the best ceviche I've had was only $3-5 and served in a plastic cup...this doesn't fare much better esp for the money. 

Shredded Beef Taquitos ($10): Avocado Sauce, Cotija Cheese, Sour Cream, Radish, Onion & Cilantro. There were 3 rolls here...pretty good!  Not sure if I would order them again though.

Eva went with the Cabo Azul ($30): Maine Lobster Enchilada in Creamy Pasilla Sauce, Grilled Chili Relleno with Monterey Jack, Shrimp and Dungeness Crab in Relleno, and Shrimp Taco Ensenada style. Lots going on here...everything was good, but I think the SHRIMP TACO was actually the best choice here.  Surprising I know!

I went with the Carnitas ($25): Michoacan style Pork served with Refritos, Guac, Salsa Quemada, Grilled Green Onions & Cilantro. This was delicious! SUPER flavorful carnitas...I've never had it like this before!  This dish would be highly recommended :P

Easily the most I've spent on Mexican food, but given the location, setting, flavor and service, it is a memorable dinner on the strip!
