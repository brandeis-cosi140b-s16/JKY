So this is a review for the bar only..of all the times I have been to the Silverton I have yet to eat here.
This was stop 3 on the Thursday Pub Crawl and by then word must have gotten out since it was packed. We caught the end of it since we went and ate @ Twin Creeks when it started. My friends wanted to do a few shots so we wormed our way to the bar & they were served some pretty huge shots of tequila. After that it was onto the final stop of the night. So even tho it was packed the service was pretty fast.
