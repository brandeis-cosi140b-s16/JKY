What this place does, it does well.  The tortas are huge and flavorful!  If you're looking for healthy, you won't find it here.  If you're looking for a gnarly, greasy, massive sandwich, you came to the right place.  Hungover?  This is your spot.  On a diet?  This is not.  I recommend everybody try it at least once.
