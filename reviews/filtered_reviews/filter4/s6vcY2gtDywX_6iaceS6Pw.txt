This was our choice for brunch before a day out on the town. They offer an AYCE brunch special, ordered from their Tapas menu with available bottomless Mimosas if you're into that. They also have a small, standard mexican menu for those not into the AYCE like my wife. They have a great selection of various dishes from our favorite, the Chilaquiles, to a breakfast sandwich and pretty much a little of everything in between. The food was served fresh and the service was solid. I didn't notice anyone with an empty drink for anymore than a few moments. And since nearly all of us were doing the AYCE, we constantly had various plates of food to eat on the table. One thing that stood out to me was how loud this place was, definitely above average as I found myself speaking quite loud just so the person sitting across from me could hear. As for value, be prepared to open your wallet. as this place is pretty pricey.
