LOS ALAMOS COMES TO VEGAS

Ordered to share a Green Verde Carlito's burrito smothered for just an extra $1.00  Added a giant burrito sized sopapilla, tossed salad and pork posole for $3.00 more which is well worth the extra coin spent.  Only item we didn't find were the blue nachos. Otherwise, one burrito plus the sides more than fulfilled our hunger. Our burrito was filled meat only... no carbs... which was perfectly executed.  Seasoning was spiced perfectly. Understand that they also offer a sopapilla burrito which explains the burrito size.  

Very casual and folksy place filled with all sorts of  New Mexico artworks for purchase. Seating is tight and comfortable. Three flat screens to watch college bowl games. For sure we'll be back for more.
