As a gal originally from Southern California I was in the mood for some Wahoo's. Thank God some have been sprouting up in Las Vegas! When I first started coming ro this Wahoo's my car or the girl of my girlfriend was one of only a few in the lot. Now the lot is ALWAYS packed. The service is super speedy and they remeber our orders now. They have an awesome happy hour. I wish it wasn't so far out in the boonies.
