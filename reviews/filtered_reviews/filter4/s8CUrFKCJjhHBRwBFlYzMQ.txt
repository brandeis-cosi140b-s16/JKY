This place is soooo cute! The only reason I give it four stars is because our food took a little while to come out. People sat down waaaay after us and got their food before us. Not mad at all, but a little communication as to what was going on would have been nice. Our server JESUS was really sweet and had a great sense of humor! I'll be going back to try a different dish, as they have a HUGE menu!
