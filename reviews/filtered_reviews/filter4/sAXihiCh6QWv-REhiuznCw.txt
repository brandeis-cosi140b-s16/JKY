I LOVED the tacos! 

My friend and I each ordered two because we wanted a snack before dinner. But they were so good that I ordered one more and she ordered two more. I didn't know it was a restaurant by Andres until I overheard a server telling another table. I wasn't surprised each taco was $5 because I'm used to overpaying in Vegas but it was well worth it! Each taco was so flavorful!

Conchinita - bbq pork with magenta-colored marinated onions

Barbacoa del Res- bbq beef with chile and pickled cactus

Pancita al Pastor - pork belly with pineapple
