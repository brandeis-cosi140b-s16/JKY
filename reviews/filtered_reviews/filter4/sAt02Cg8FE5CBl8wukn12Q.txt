Four stars based mainly on the margarita being the best effing margarita I have ever tasted.  I chose one that had pineapple and chipotle pepper.  Hot-damn, it was good.

I also ordered the chicken fajitas which were lovely.  A nice balance of peppers and onions with really tasty marinated meat.  

Our server seemed a bit overwhelmed; I think he was the only one on a Tuesday afternoon.  Even still, he was on the ball.  Well done, man.
