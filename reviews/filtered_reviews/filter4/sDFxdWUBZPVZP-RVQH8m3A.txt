My first two visits to Elmer's were good ones.  I've tried the green chili burro (excellent, quite spicy), beef tacos (average), bean and cheese burro (very good), red beef burro (very good) and their rice and beans are both quite tasty.  

Service is very quick and friendly.  Convenient parking right off of Arizona Avenue,  just north of Chandler Blvd.  I would assume it is very busy during school lunch hours with the high school not far away, so I've avoided those hours.  Each time I've been there it's been relatively slow (no line) with just a handful of people in the dining area.

Prices are fair and you get a good amount of food for your buck.  Will be on my regular rotation of Mexican joints!
