My husband and I dined here twice within one week to seek solace after spending a lot of time in the Expo store down the way, where we were setting the wheels in motion for a huge kitchen remodel. Happy to report that our enchiladas and tacos provided sufficient comfort. The sauces are especially distinctive and good. There will be one more visit to Expo, after which I'm sure I'll head in the same direction -- and add a double margarita to my order.
