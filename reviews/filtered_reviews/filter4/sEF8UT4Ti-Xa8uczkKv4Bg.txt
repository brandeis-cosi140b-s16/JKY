We visited two nights in a row on our recent trip to the Boulders Resort. The first night we sat on the outdoor patio and enjoyed margaritas with chips and salsa. The cactus heart cocktail is delicious, and the alcohol content is perfect- not too weak, not too boozy. Both nights I ordered the signature shrimp tacos because they were so yummy. The second night we also shared a bowl of the tortilla soup, delicious with greens and tortilla strips.

The decor inside is fun and festive, with pretty light fixtures and wall hangings. Service is friendly and timely.
