We stumbled across Leticia's by a wrong turn, but we are glad we found it! We stopped in for lunch- the food is authentic and they serve complimentary chips with salsa and bean dip, my boyfriend and I ordered house margaritas which were quite tasty and then we shared a carne aside platter. The food was delicious, definitely recommend trying the cilantro rice- it was great! Our service was very friendly and always attentive. I really enjoyed our experience and the atmosphere was very fun!
