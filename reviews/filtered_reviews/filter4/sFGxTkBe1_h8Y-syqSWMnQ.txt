Stopped by here for lunch with some coworkers while we were attending a convention.  Yum!  We were all pleasantly surprised!  Great customer service, great food... can't lose.

I had the Baja ceviche that really took me back to Baja California.  Spot on.  Have you seen Ratatouille?  The moment the critic took a bite of that ratatouille dish and he had a flashback memory of when his mom would make the dish?  That was me.. except it took me back to a Carnival cruise I took to Baja several years ago :)

I also had the white peach lemonade which was delish but more on the sweet side than expected.  No complaints really; it was still really good.  Some of my coworkers got the blood orange lemonade, and I swear they were talking about it the remainder of the day... and into the next day.  I guess I should've ordered that one!

My coworkers all ordered different tacos, and they all said it was much better than expected.  We ordered the guacamole to share, and it was really good too!  I was expecting something along the lines of El Torito, but it's significantly better.
