See, all my friends but one hate this place. I always beg and plead for Mi Patio, but no one ever wants to go. The complaint is always the same, that the food tastes like soap most of the time. 

And then it dawned on me.

The only other person who likes this place as much as I do usually also leaves as tanked as I do.

The $1.25 margaritas mentioned before absolutely do their trick.

Call me a boozebag, call me easily distracted, but I loooove Mi Patio.
