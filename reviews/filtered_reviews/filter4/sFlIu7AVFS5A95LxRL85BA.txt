Looks gross from the outside, I was so hesitant when my friend suggested this place for dinner! 

When you walk in, it is pretty cute looking. Casual dining but cute decor and clean. 

I ordered tacos and my friend had the quesadilla. The best part was the fresh tortillas which were fried up on the grill and nice and crispy! The carnitas I has were delightful but very greasy. The grease was dripping all over, gross. It didn't impact the taste too much however.  I had rice and beans on the side. They were not tasty. A little overcooked I think. I couldn't even eat them and I'm not too picky.

To drink they have everything you could imagine and traditional Mexican faire. I had horchata which was good. Very cinnamony and heavy.
