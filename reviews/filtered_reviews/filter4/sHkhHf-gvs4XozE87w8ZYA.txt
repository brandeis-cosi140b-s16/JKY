This review is of the Saturday/Sunday Brunch
A group of us had a tradition of having Sunday Brunch at Gardunos at the Palms.  When Palms changed hands... so went Gardunos.

Border Grill became a substitute.  We ate for free, or steep discounted, the first couple of times.  I didn't have an offer this last trip, but I gladly paid full price.  And for us, it's worth it.

The brunch is all you can eat, but it's not served buffet style.  You order small plates.  We spend more than 2 hours doing this.  We put out the extra money for the endless mimosas and plan to take it very easy for Sunday afternoon.

They rotate the menu a little all the time.  Some times we lose favorites (the Passion fruit mimosa or the fritata), but we also get new things to try.

The first time we went (several years ago) there were some service issues (weren't prepared for how many people were dining).  Problems have been resolved.  Service has been excellent since that first trip.  They get the next dishes to us quickly and keep the mimosas coming.

I won't recommend any dishes, because you can discover it all for yourself.  Just save plenty of room, and have a place to relax in the afternoon.

I can understand not everyone will enjoy it as much as we have, but I love all the different small plates with the variety of flavors.
