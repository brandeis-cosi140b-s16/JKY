I have to say, these fish tacos are mighty good.  

I was reading an article in Charlotte's edition of Creative Loafing and the writer mentioned ordering two specific tacos which found to be delightful. Having live most of my life near the coast, I have a rule about eating seafood so far inland. Yet, I've heard nothing but good things about this restaurant and I was literally a block away..so how could I resist?

I ordered a BBQ Mahi taco, which I'm told was featured on 'Diner's, Drive In and Dives.'  The fish wasn't as fresh as it would be at a beachfront taco stand and the sauce was a tad sweet for me, but that was nothing a little hot sauce couldn't fix. 

I also ordered a Tavaroo Tuna taco, which had a hint of wasabi and was fantastic. 

It was early Saturday night and the dining room was filling up quickly, so I say at the bar and could observe everything coming out of the kitchen..and it all looked delectable.  

Nice margarita menu and beer selection too.
