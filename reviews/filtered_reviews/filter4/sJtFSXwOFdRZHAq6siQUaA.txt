I feel like I'm writing an obituary, as they have temporarily closed their brick and mortar restaurant due to impending development on that plot of land. 

I think my favorite thing I ever ate at Paz was the pork belly tacos. It was just the right portion of pork belly, and could also be paired with the chicken tinga or nopales tacos. I tried the pork belly torta, and it just didn't have the spice or flavor I was hoping for, but the tacos were scrumptious. 

The house margarita was also amazing--inexpensive, but they didn't skimp on the quality. I'm looking forward to going to the new space someday and enjoying tacos and a margarita.

And in light of this obit, I'm so excited that they've opened a food truck in the interim, before their new brick and mortar space is open and ready in the far future. I guess this food truck proves there really is life after death.
