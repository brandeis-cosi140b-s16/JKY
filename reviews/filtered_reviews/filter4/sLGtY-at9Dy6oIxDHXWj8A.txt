We stopped in here for a quick lunch on a Tuesday in August. We picked up some tacos and ate in the little seating area outside. The food was cheap and delicious. They had lots of options for different meats and salsas. I got chicken, barbacoa, and carne asada tacos all with the red hot salsa. Everything tasted good, and it was nice to get a quick, cheap, tasty lunch right on the Vegas Strip.
