Small authentic Mexican restaurant nestled in old town Scottsdale. We sat on the hidden outdoor patio that offers plenty of shade from the merciless Arizona sun.  We arrived around 1130 and the patio was wide open but by noon all the tables were filled with locals and tourists alike.

Prices are very reasonable, around 8-10 bucks each and we enjoyed a couple of great margaritas in the warm Arizona sunshine.  The chicken tacos were good, but the standout was the soft chicken tacos covered in poblano cream sauce - unbelievably good.  We also liked their chips and salsa.

Service was a bit uneven but we didn't mind, it was great to escape the winter and just bathe in the warmth.
