A perfect stop on the strip to stop in for a drink. You don't need to go in through the hotel to get in. It is an open air venue so you get a lot of fresh air.

We ordered two Margaritas and the bartenders talked us into a pitcher (twist our arms). The 'ritas were quite tasty.

The bartender takes great photos as well!
