A friend of mine suggested this place, so when I flew into Phoenix I made a bee line for it. Rockerij is a stone building with a small parking lot (I'm from Texas so everything else is small). There were two options: the restaurant and the "cellar". Which did I choose you ask? The cellar, of course!

The cellar contained a few booth tables with throw pillows (how cool is that!), a long wooden bar and a roaring fire. My friend and I sat at the bar and I'm happy to report we were just in time for happy hour! Happy hour being from 3-6. I ordered a margarita, which was delightfully lovely with a hint of fresh squeezed orange juice. I've never had a margarita that tasted like that! 

Food wise, my friend and I shared the Ahi Tuna with wasabi salsa and soft shell tacos. The Ahi was perfect, lightly seared and the salsa was a perfect combination. The tacos were good, not amazing but good. The chicken taco had the best flavor.
