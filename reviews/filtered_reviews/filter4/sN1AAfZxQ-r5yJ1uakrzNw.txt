We were staying at the Westin and decided to wander over to the village to find a place for dinner. First let me say that I'm not a Mexican food connoisseur; I judge the food based not on authenticity but on whether it tastes good - and it definitely did. I had Combo #2 with carne asada enchilada and chile relleno. The steak wasn't the most tender I'd ever had but the flavor was good. Their take on a chile relleno was different than I'd ever had - the relleno was suspended in a cloud of egg white batter, which I enjoyed. One thing I also liked is that their menu is gluten-free friendly in its labeling. Overall, a delicious meal in a nice patio atmosphere.
