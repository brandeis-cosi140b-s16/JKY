Very good sized tacos! They are 3 dollars with any meat and extra 1.50 for crema, cheese and guacamole! I love, love avocados so I was very happy when I saw a lot of guacamole on them! I also ordered the mango agua fresca and I though it was pretty good considering that It was only 2 bucks for real fruit! The only bad thing is that they were pretty busy at lunch time so we had to wait a while, on top of that they forgot to make my bfs order so we had to wait even longer .. Overall a good Mexican food in a clean and pleasant restaurant!
