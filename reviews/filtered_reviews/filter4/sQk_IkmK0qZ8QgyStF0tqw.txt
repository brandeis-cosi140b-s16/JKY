I really enjoy the food here. There is not much to the interior or the decor. But the food is fresh and delicious. The lady behind the counter is very nice and always smiling. The prices are average for lunch. The options on the menu are pretty standard for a mexican food place, but the quality of the food is great. I think you could say this place is similar to a Chipotle but the flavors are more authentic and less mass-produced if that makes any sense.
