What do Mao Tse Tung and Frida Kahlo have in common?  Besides their intimate connections to communism and controversial personal lives, they also both appear as projected photographic wall art at China Poblano.  I adore Frida and collect mementos from her life.  I can't say the same for Mao but don't mind seeing his picture every so often at this restaurant.  China Poblano has a fresh concept, delicious food that mixes quality ingredients with creative combinations, and an artistic urban atmosphere.

If you come alone, sit at the bar, it's communal and gives you a peek into the kitchen with cooks demonstrating their skills.  If you come with a group, sit by the wall with exhibits of colorful Chinese masks and Mexican figurines, which appear surprisingly similar when displayed together, (these tables also have cushioned benches that are much more comfortable than the ones under photographs of Mao & Frida).

Everything is tapas style, we discovered about 2 items per person is a good amount of food.  Scallop dumplings are very tasty and served in authentic bamboo steamers.  I also love the Dan Dan Mian, wheat noodles in a spicy ground pork sauce.  Hot & sour soup has real content, not just broth.  But my favorite is the Singapore Sling, their signature cocktail.  It's very good gin paired with pineapple juice that they make in house plus other delicious things that come together for a fabulous concoction.

They did forget a couple of our orders so it seems like management is still settling in.  All forgivable under this prismatic fun house where I can eat delectable fusion food.
