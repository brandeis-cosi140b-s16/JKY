I really, really loved Border Grill and wanted to give them 5 stars, however they charge $1 for water (that is filtered tap water, but all restaurants are required to have filtered tap water, so its silly). The restaurant is really pretty inside and reminds me a bit of Frontera Grill in Chicago. We went for lunch and I had guac as an appetizer which was very, very good. The three salsas and chips were great too. My husband had steak tacos and enjoyed them and I had the chicken chiquilles which were good but had too many chip and not enough chicken. My red and green rice was very good too. Now as far as deserts go, we had the two half slice desert. We choose the Mexican chocolate cake which I wouldn't pick again and the banana cream pie which was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Our server was good and I would definitely go back and try something else.
