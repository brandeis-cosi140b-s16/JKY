I loved the food here. The ambiance not so much- the TVs were crazy loud and the interior was very similar to Rodibertos. However, they had ice cold bottled " Mexican"  Coke, and the BEST street tacos I have ever had. Delicious! Super fresh salsa, plentiful lime wedges, And so much steak it was a tough job to power it all down. I mean, I totally did- but it was a bit of a challenge. The rice was only OK, and the beans were so-so. But the tacos were crazy good. They were also quite speedy which is always good when you are on lunch break.
