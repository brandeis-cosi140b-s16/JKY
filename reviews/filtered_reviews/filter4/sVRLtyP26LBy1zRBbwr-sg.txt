Perhaps typing this review while I'm anxiously awaiting lunch hour is not the best idea, I'm drooling on my keyboard thinking about the Stand goodness! I've been here a half-dozen times now, have brought friends with me and everyone has loved everything they've gotten. I'd say the burger is my favorite item, and if you're feeling like a serious indulgence go for the Salted Dulce de Leche Shake - its like heaven in a cup. 

I've ordered and ate inside as well as gone through the drive-thru window there, and each time my experience has been great. They're making the meals to order, so obviously you're going to wait a minute that but that's better than being served a heat-lamp patty anyday! I love that the burgers as seasoned so well, amazing every time. The fries weren't really my thing, but I'm a picky fry eater so that's to be expected. The tacos were really good too, I've tried all of them and typically lean toward the chicken one as my favorite. 

Give the stand a shot, you're going to be glad you did. Can't beat hot, fresh, made to order food for a reasonable price! :)
