Awesome Happy Hour! This is a super chill spot on 16th Street with a fantastic Happy Hour and Reverse Happy Hour that rivals any in town with lots of great food options and a really good selection of wines for $5 at Happy Hour prices. The atmosphere is great and there is an open grill right in front of the bar where you can watch your food being prepared, a huge fire place area that is really chill for just chatting with a date. It is one of those environments that just can't help but relax you after a long week.
  If you go make sure and check out the downstairs, it is very hidden and not easily accessible but i have found only a few places better for a first date (not a blind date LOL) than the rokerij.
