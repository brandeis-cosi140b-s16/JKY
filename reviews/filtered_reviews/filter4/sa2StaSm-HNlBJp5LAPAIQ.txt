Really great food and delicious (strong!) drinks.  Good spot for a group of people while you're in Vegas.  Much spicier than east coast Mexican food, so be prepared for the heat.  The service was on the slow side, but it's a VERY busy restaurant, and it's better than feeling rushed out.  The food was well worth the wait.
