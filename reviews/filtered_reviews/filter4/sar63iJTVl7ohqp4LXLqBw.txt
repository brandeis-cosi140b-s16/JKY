This place was amazing!

I've been here once before a few years ago and I definitely had the same experience.

Staff was super friendly and helpful with menu suggestions, the live music was cheesy yet awesome, place was clean, service fast, food delicious!

The chips, bean dip and salsa hold you over until you get your food.  I ordered the three chicken tacos and it came with Fideo soup to start, Mexican rice and beans.  My wife ordered the Novillo Al Conac which was steak with a reduced mushroom sauce, Mexican rice, beans and tortilla.  She loved it!

For an appetizer we had some awesome Ceviche Camaron.  Not too wet, not to dry, plenty of shrimp and very tasty.

For dessert, we got the Lindo Flameado (fried ice cream surrounded by banana slices).  They set it on fire right in front of us. It smelled good and tasted even better!

Also the Dulce De Leche was ordered and it was fantastic!  My wife initially didn't want any but ended up eating half of it. 

Nice place to have dinner on a night out.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.
