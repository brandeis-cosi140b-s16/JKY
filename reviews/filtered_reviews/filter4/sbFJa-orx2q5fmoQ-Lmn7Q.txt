My favorite fake Mexican good place in Vegas!

It's delicious, not authentic.

This particular location has some great staff and is always fast. They do tend to be less friendly during the dinner rush, but that's human nature.

I always get a salad, rotating between pork and chile roast beef. Their tortillas are the best you can get from a place of such caliber. I love them. I hear they make them with lard.

Also: horchata. Need I say mas?

(Get it?)
