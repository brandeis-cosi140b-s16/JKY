Great place. I had grouper served with brussels sprouts and a banana infused crab cake. Delicious, and the glass of Gruner Veltliner was the perfect compliment. 

The service was attentive and the server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and wine list. 

The only reason I don't give 5 stars is the shortage of menus and napkins. C'mon, it's not like you just opened.  And it was clear from the hostess' comments that this isn't the first time this has happened. Invest in some more menus and napkins so I don't have to share with the rest of the table. (You really have to trust your companions when it comes to sharing a napkin)
