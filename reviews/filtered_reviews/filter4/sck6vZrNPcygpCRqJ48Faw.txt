Try Round Corner for happy hour on a weekday. You can get pitchers of margaritas or sangria for $19. Both are fabulous. You won't be disappointed.

The guacamole is delicious, as are the chips. Note that the chips are fresh, but they are also fried, so don't go too crazy. I had the shrimp tacos, and I loved the cheesiness of them, and I also enjoyed that the tacos were made of corn and very fresh.

The decor is a little bizarre, but it adds to the quaintness of the place. I will definitely be back.
