Good Tex-Mex, go for lunch, it is the same as the dinner menu, but less expensive.  I love everything there, the rellenos are great.  I also love the candies they give out at the door.

The service has always been good.  Eat here now, the prices constantly go up!

The restrooms are tucked away by the bar, nice private clean stalls and stocked, 4 Flushes.
