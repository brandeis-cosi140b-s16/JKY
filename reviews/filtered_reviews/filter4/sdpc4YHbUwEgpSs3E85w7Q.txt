Nice local burger joint. 

Simple menu and pretty plain decor but that's fine with me. The focus is obviously on the food as it should be with a small place like this. In a city with a chain on every corner The Stand sets itself apart with its French Fries. These are French Fries not soggy, greasy fresh cut fries like 5 guys. 
Most likely soaked in water for hours to remove the starch and double cooked to make them crispy. Dare I say they are using Kennebec Potatoes? 

My mother had the burger and I ordered the tacos. The burger looked like a In N Out/ Shake Shack hybrid and she said it was fantastic.
The tacos were ok, next time I'll order a burger and likely add the last star.
It's priced right and the service was EXCELLENT, great friendly staff!
