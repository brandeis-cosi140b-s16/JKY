Great food and great prices. I love their carnitas, simply delicious. Carnitas burrito, tortas, and super nachos are all very tasty and they give you a lot of meat on your entrees as well. Missing the fifth star because the restaurant is not always clean. But overall the food is great, service is friendly, and the prices are good. I will be returning on a regular basis.
