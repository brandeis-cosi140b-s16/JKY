Came here after a good game of golf (actually it wasn't so good for me, but that's another story):

Pros:
  * Really clean interior / dining area
  * Incredibly tasty Shrimp Tostadas
  * they have Agua de Frescas!
  * clean restrooms (one person at a time)

Cons:
  * The Agua de Fresca wasn't too refreshing.
  * Salsa was mediocre
  
Tips:
  * If you are looking for silverware (or in this case it would be plasticware), it's to the back of the restaurant (assuming you are at the cashier's and facing the cashier register)
  *  The bathroom has a padlock, but they always leave it unlocked

I'm big on tacos and I must say, I'm a fan of Los Tacos.  They have some really good Tostadas and they have a pretty good selection of meet, including some of my favs:  Lengua (Tongue) and Cabeza ( Beef's Head).
Aside from Tostadas and the typical burritos/tacos, they also have Tortas.  The portions are pretty good and the price isn't the greatest, but it is far from being an expensive eat.  The tacos are overstuffed and looked amazing (my cousin ordered one).  The burritos were long and thinner than say a burrito at Roberto's, but the taste packed a punch for sure!  They have green salsa at every table (except the one I sat at.. ha, I had to snatch one off of a vacant table by mine), but it's far from being spicy.  Thank god my burrito came with a few chiles.  For a typical taco joint, I must say they take more time to assure they have a nice little presentation.  Sure the burrito was wrapped in foil, but next to it in the plastic basket lined with white paper was a small edible garnishment constructed of a few crunchy tortilla chips and a house salsa concoction.  The salsa itself had a weird taste, but nonetheless, I thought it was nice to see Los Tacos takes time to up the ante when it comes to presentation.  The Agua de Fresca here was not up to par in my opinion.  I'm a big fan of Melon (cantelope), which they had; but it was way too think.  I'll stick to Cardena's for my Melon fix.  Overall, they place was pretty good and I could definitely see myself coming again.  I came hungry and left full and satisfied.  Misison accomplished!
