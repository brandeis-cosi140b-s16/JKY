Someburro's is a great place to grab an inexpensive meal when you are too tired to make anything and/or feel like having a big satisfying mexican meal. You can call in your meal ahead of time and tt has a drive thru if you're really feeling lazy. I like Someburro's when I feel like having a fatty, lazy meal - you can deep fry whatever you order for $1 more. 

- Veggie Burrito: This baby comes double wrapped (yes, TWO giant tortillas) and is filled with beans, cheese, and their very good guacamole salsa. I really like the guac-salsa more than the regular guacamole. The guac-salsa is literally guacamole mixed with pico de gallo and somehow the combination is better than the two parts. I get this enchilada style with the red sauce, which is really really good enchilada sauce. It is very creamy and thick and has a very yummy flavor.
- Cheese Enchiladas: Not as good as the enchilada-style veggie burrito (I think) but passable. Definitely get the meal version because the enchiladas themselves are on the small side.
- Rice & Beans: Nothing special here, just standard average orange rice and refried beans.
