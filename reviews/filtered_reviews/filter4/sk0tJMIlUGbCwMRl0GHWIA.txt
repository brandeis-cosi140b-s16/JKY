I have only been twice, but I am a fan! The happy hour is great. Fun atmosphere and affordable prices.  If you go, do try the chicken quesadillas.  The chicken is plump, white chunks with delicious melted cheese.  Yum.  Wish I had one right now.  Chips and salsa are pretty darn good too- margaritas are great too if you are in the mood.
