So, to remove any confusion.  This is NOT a part of the El Torito chain of Mexican restaurants found in most of Southern California.

This El Torito is a family creation that still sits on Boulder Hwy in Henderson on the way to Boulder City.  The area that it lives in used to be surrounded by unique businesses.  Such as Old Vegas, which was for the most part a Western Theme Park, the Nevada History Museum, and a Motel...I can't remember it's name but is resembled the Bate's Motel from Psycho.  

Now most of those places are gone but El Torito still stands and is still family owned and operated.  Some of the menu has changed and they've added some American fare, but the old recipes still exist and are worth a try.  My favorite is still their Albondigas soup....which is a meatball soup with onions and other such vegetables in the broth, yum.

If you're passin' through Hendertucky on the way to Lake Mead, make sure you stop by and get a plate Taco's....it'll make your tummy smile.
