Maybe one of the best bean and cheese burritos I have ever eaten....except the beans were so runny it was like thick soup in a flour tortilla.  The place is in an old house with seating outside, cash only and just like Chipotle there are 3-4 items on the menu.  Either you get a burrito, chimi, or tostada with either beans, red, or green chili.  You probably cant go wrong with anything here since this place has obviously been open here forever and the service is OK but that is how it goes with authentic Mexican food places.  I'll go back soon....
