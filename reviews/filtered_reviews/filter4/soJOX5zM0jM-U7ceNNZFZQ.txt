This place is absolutely Fantastic! the green sauce and the chicken compliment each other so well. i definitely recommend.

The service is also really good, if they know you are new they will explain everything to you, and make sure that you understand. This place is exactly like chipotle, just a little less corporate. This place is a must visit, even if it is just once!
