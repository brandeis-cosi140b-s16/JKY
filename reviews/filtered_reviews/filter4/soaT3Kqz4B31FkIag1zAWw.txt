This place is right off the strip and well worth the adventure, as it is cheap, delicious, and authentic.
The biggest drawback is the long lines, which are awful when you are starving and have to smell everything going on inside.
The carne asada fries are a must and do not disappoint.
This is a great alternative to the pricey strip! O and they are open really late.
