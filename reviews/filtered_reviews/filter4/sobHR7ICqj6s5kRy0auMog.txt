Thanks to Groupon, I found this place.  We've been here several times and I don't agree with the 2 1/2 stars rating.  it's definitely not the best place I've ever eaten, but it's good.  Here's what I've had here:

Cheese Crisp - $8.99

All of these are pretty good, especially the Chicken Tortilla Soup, Hard Tacos, and Soft Tacos....yum!

The complimentary Chips & Salsa comes out with a mild Salsa, but if you ask they'll bring out very Spicy Salsa, which is awesome.

The people who work here are very friendly and always welcome us with a smile.  As a matter of fact, they know that we'll start with a Cheese Crisp and Spicy Salsa so before we sit down they're already working on the order.  I like great service like this.

There's also a lot of TV's in the restaurant, so we come here for lunch on Saturday or Sunday and watch football while we eat.

Overall, it is definitely a 4 Star experience in my book.
