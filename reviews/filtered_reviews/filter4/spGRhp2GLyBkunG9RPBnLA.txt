Barrio Queen has been open, now, long enough to have worked out the bugs.  The food at lunch was fantastic.  The street tacos are fresh and flavorful.  Everything is cooked to order - even the tortillas.  The service is fun and friendly.  There are two sections to the restaurant - casual and a bit upscale.  Try one side one day and the other section the next.  Absolutely up to the standards of Barrio Cafe.
