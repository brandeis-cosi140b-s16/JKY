They have an awesome been dip...! Margarita's are pretty desent.  

My friend had her wedding reception here and it was lovely. They had a gorgeous Mexican theme table setting. 

The food was delicious, the variety was huge... my favorite was the Green Salsa with meat & guacamole was great, very fresh...!
