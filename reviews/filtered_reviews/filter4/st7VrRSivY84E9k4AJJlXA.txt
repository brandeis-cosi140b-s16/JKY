A little pricey but delicious!! We started off with the Street Food Platter ... so delish that right there is a meal in its self! Apparently the selections vary but I believe on that day we had the biggest calamari I have seen in my life, quesadillas, and some kind of meatballs which were pretty tasty. I had the Pan Seared Sea Scallops and Shrimp as my main course and it was delish ... but very salty. I love salt nom nom nom... but those scallops were like pretty much soaked in a vat of salt and then thrown into the pan . The shrimp was delish but the scallops thumbs down . My sister had the chicken tacos and she thought they were pretty tasty as well. We told the waiter it was my sisters birthday and he brought out a piece of a piece of the four milk cake ... obviously they didn't include chocolate milk in this cake so I didn't eat any, but my sister did she said it was alright. She may have enjoyed it more if we weren't so full off of the appetizer, margaritas and main course! Overall I really liked this place and would love to try it again!
