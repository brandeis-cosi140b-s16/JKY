Been living in the valley for ten years now, have driven past Fajitas a million times, it wasn't until Jan this year that I ventured into the joint with some friends who gave this place 2 thumbs up! Let me tell ya I wasn't let down! The kitchen is opened; anywhere you sit you can see what's going on. The tortillas are homemade!!! That's right homemade! They are not your thin gonna crack when you fold them in  1/2 ones either! They are on the thick side, but its perfect for your fajitas & toppings! I'm sure they have items on the menu, but I couldn't tell you, I have been twice and haven't made it past the steak fajitas, but friends have ordered the shrimp fajitas and they don't do not skimp out on the shrimp! They also give you a plate that has pico de gallo, cheese and sour cream for your toppings but you can also ask for the guacamole, which I heard is good, but I haven't tried it myself yet. Service is good and friendly & we got a table pretty fast for being a Sat night.. Definitely plan on going back!
