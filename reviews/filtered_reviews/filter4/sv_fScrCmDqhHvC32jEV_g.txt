I like to find the Cuban places and one of my favorite sandwiches, the Cuban! The mini  Cuban on the menu is wonderful, Add a bit more sauce and it would be perfect for me. The Bread appetizer was warm and perfect. The Chicken soup is chunky enough  and flavorful. With the lemon squeeze (I would have preferred lime) it is quite enhanced. All in all - I am coming back to test a few more items and enjoy the lovely ambiance and snappy service. Live Music on Friday and Saturday and I want to be part of that, but that will be another trip.
