This is really a 4.5!
Pancho's was great. Nice place and great service. We had a party if 11 and there was plenty of room and the room were sat in was nice and loud like we are. Food was great with large portions and good flavor but is overpriced slightly.
I recommend the shrimp and crab quesadilla and enchiladas deal mar!!
