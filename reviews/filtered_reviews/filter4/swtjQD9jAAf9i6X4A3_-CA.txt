Yum! After three visits I am a huge fan! The chili relleno torta is my favorite and the guacamole is really great as well. The burritos are huge and very good as well. I have had great service each time I have gone and love the patio and unique atmosphere. Some of the different margarita flavors sound odd and end up being really good so try them! There are some unique selections on the menu and I can't wait to try more of them but I can't seem to get past the chili relleno torta! The fries that come with it have chili powder seasoning on them which is different but I really liked it. Huge tequilla selection if you are interested in trying different ones. Our server was knowledgable about them which was nice. I will be back to try some tacos and happy hour!
