What an awesome dive - they focus on the food and do it well at LuLu's.

The food was incredibly fresh and flavorful. I had 3 chicken tacos, guacamole and lemonade. The pico was perfect, very fresh with just a little heat. My tacos were well seasoned, and overall the meal was incredibly satisfying.

I really love this place and plan to add it to our rotation for good local places to eat and or get take out.
