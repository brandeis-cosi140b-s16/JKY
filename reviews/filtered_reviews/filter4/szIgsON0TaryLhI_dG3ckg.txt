Night  Staff very friendly as I have been here twice just before closing.   Flan $3.95  is best I have had in the valley.  Trust me, I've had many.  Corn is delicious.  Beans are creamy.  Although, Vampiro w Carne asada  $3.50 was delicious  I wish it was larger.  Get 2 as 1 will not fill you.  Horchata good but not as good as La Condesa Gourmet Taco.   Ample easy free lot parking.   Almost a 5.
