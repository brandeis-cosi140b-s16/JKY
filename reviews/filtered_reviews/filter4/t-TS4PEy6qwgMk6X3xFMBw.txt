Macayo's is a chain but it is a staple of my visits to Vegas. Partly because it is about 2 blocks from my mom's house and partly because I absolutly LOVE their tortilla soup. It is super simple as it consists of broth, cheese and tortilla chips with a little bit of stewed tomatoes. No meat.
I really like their chips and sauce. The chips are thin and they serve two different sauces. One is mild and slightly chunky and the other is a little hotter and smooth like a taco sauce. Both are good but I typically gravitate towards the hotter one or I combine them together.
Also, can't pass up a margarita when I go with mom. If you purchase one of their margarita glasses you get a discount on the margaritas whenever you bring it back in. I bought one probably 20 years ago but never think to take it with me. Guess I should try to remember that next time I head to Vegas.
Macayo's was a popular "after football game" hangout for high school students back in the 70s so it is always a little nostalgic for me to go there. Unfortunately, back then, I only ate burgers :(
