Great food and service! This was our first first to the East Blvd location and we were impressed. I ordered the enchiladas de pollo and the wife ordered steak quesadillas. Both were great with bold flavor. The rice and beans were some of the best I have had; I was impressed from the first bite. 

Service was friendly, quick, and knowledgeable. A new glass of Coke was dropped off every time I was halfway through the previous. 

Looking forward to our next visit!
