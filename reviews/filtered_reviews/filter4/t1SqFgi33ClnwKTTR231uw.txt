We tried Chapala's for the first time, today. We had always gone over to Casa Don Juan, but their service and quality really dropped off last time, and so we decided to try something new. How very lucky for us that we did!

First of all, the menu covers just about every option for which I could hope when going to a Mexican restaurant. Page after page of different combinations, different menu items - I give that a big thumbs up. However, it's not all about the menu; the food has to be good. So, we ordered (I got the combo plate of enchiladas and a tamale), and hoped for the best.

So many Mexican restaurants here use, for their enchilada sauce, that Ortega crap right out of the salty little can. Not Chapala's. Nope - this was clearly homemade by someone who knows how enchilada sauce should taste. At least, that's what the red sauce was. The green sauce was another story altogether. That appeared, fully formed, from the mind of a benevolent God who wants us to be happy. If I wasn't full to the point where taking a breath makes me pee a little, I'd sit down with a pitcher of that green sauce and just drink it. 

I'm going back. I'm going back often. I have my new favorite Mexican place.
