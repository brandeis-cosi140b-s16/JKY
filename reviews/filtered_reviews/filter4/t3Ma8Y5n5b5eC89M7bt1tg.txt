I am a self professed Sam Fox groupie. Every restaurant I have been to by him, I have loved. Blanco did not disappoint. I came with a group of 7 girls on Saturday night, and while they told us 35 to 40 min wait, it was only about 15. Score! We shared 2 bowls of guacamole which was delish. The chips were addictive, I told myself I wouldn't have any but these were better than any I had ever had. I had the roasted chicken, green Chile pork, and shredded tacos combo. Roasted chicken was my favorite. The rice packed a lot of flavor, and the beans were so-so. I enjoyed the Paloma cocktail. Yes the tacos were small, but the rice and beans were generous and I left feeling quite full. Sam Fox has yet to disappoint!
