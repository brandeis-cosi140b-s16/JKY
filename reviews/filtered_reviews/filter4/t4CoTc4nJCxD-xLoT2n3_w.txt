A group of us dined at Mercadito to celebrate Mexican Independence Day. The restaurant has several dining areas. The bar, lounge, patio and a main room. Happy Hour is only available in the bar/lounge/patio.Our group of five reserved a booth in the main dining room. 
Our server Xavier was very enthusiastic and attentive. He demonstrated his passion for food with his knowledge and thorough explanation of the menu and specialty dishes.

The traditional version of Guacamole was the starter. It is served with chips and salsa. The Guacamole was creamy with a slight amount of heat. The portion was large enough for all of us. Many of the dishes are great for sharing, such as the four Tacos Camaron served on corn tortillas. The pork was tasty and the slice of avocado provided a smooth finish. 
The next sharing was the Taquizas Brochetas. This dish consisted of several items on skewers, Grilled Shrimp, Grilled Skirt Steak and Smoked Chicken served with corn tortillas on the side along with three sauces chimichurri, salsa toreada and a mole. Each of these were excellent and a pared with a great choice of sauces.

Finally the holiday special was ordered by the majority. Chile's en Nogada is essentially a Chile in walnut sauce. It consists of a poblano pepper, walnuts, pork loin, thick cream, onion, garlic, tomatoes, parsley, apple, plantain and raisins.  It's topped w/pomegranate seeds & cilantro.  It was not very spicy, but divine.

One choice missing from the menu was flour tortillas. Mercadito only serves corn.
They also should increase the variety of wine wines by adding a Riesling.
The Margarita Tradicional was a perfect balance, just delicious.

The dessert choices were interesting and tempting but were passed for another visit that may start with dessert.
