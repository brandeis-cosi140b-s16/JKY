I came here because I was craving Mexican food and the name is hilarious!  
I ordered the Pink Tacos and the shells are actually dyed pink .  The food wasn't super authentic, but I didn't really expect that considering it was in a hotel/casino and it was called Pink Taco.  The service was great and friendly.
If you come here with a group, I would suggest ordering the buckets of beer at $19-$25 for 5 beers.  This is cheap for Vegas drink prices.
