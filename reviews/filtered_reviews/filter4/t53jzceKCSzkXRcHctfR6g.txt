Si se puede! Yes I can eat Mexican two days in a row. This was Round 2, a quick lunch with friends. Apparently the cure for a hangover is their house made sopa, so off we went to this spot I had no idea was even here, stuck on the side of a Days Inn. I have to say, I was really surprised. The decor is fantastic, I instantly forgot I was mere yards away from South Boulevard and was transported to a Mexican hideaway. While I was headed to work and stuck with water, my friend had a beer the size of his face (hair of the dog that bit him.) 

The food was delicious. I had the Lunch Special #38- Avocado Tostada- and got a kick out of saying it- 38 Special! Ha! It was really delicious, even the rice and beans which I normally shove to the side. We enjoyed our sopapillas for dessert, and then had a quick photo shoot on the mechanical donkey by the front door. Sorry to say it's not plugged in, but it's good for a stationary picture! I will definitely be back- their dessert menu alone is tempting me!
