From what I'm told this is the oldest restuarunt in Henderson and let me tell you what it looks like it , but the food was pretty good the Mexican meatball soup is a must. The meatball is full of flavor in a very tasty broth. Now I ordered the fajitas chicken and it tasted pretty good, I seen other peoples plates and they looked really good. When I'm back in Vegas I'll be back to El Torito to try some other things. This place is worth a chance for sure even though it looks like u might get robbed there.
