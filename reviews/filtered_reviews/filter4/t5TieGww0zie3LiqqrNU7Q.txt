Had lunch here today for the first time after hearing so many great things  about it. The food is enormous but still delicious. I was worried that with being on TV (Man Versus Food, a personal fave of mine) that the food would be more of a gimmick and less of a diamond in the rough. Much to my party's delight, everything we ordered was tasty and well prepared. The neighborhood of Sunnyslope is a bit rough around the edges, but this is definitely a good find and a reason to visit.

For a business/work lunch, food was quick, service was polite and we ate a ridiculous amount of food. I can't wait to try a couple of the other amazing looking tortas!
