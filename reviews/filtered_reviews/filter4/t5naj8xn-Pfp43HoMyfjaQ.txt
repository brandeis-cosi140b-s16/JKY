We were not in the mood for cooking dinner one night and we love Mexican food. The result - we went to Three Amigos after reading some nice reviews. The place was a bit small, but managed to have a bar within the premise, and was comfortable enough to accommodate quite a few people. The waiters arrived promptly, and took our orders. Nachos and salsa were on the house and we ordered guacamole along with it - guacamole was very good. For our entrees, we ordered Enchiladas Poblanos and Fajitas de Pollo. The Fajitas was served on a hot plate, and we enjoyed making our own Fajitas with the little corn tortillas. The enchiladas were also good. We had next to nothing left over, and what ever was left, we boxed it and had it the next day. Overall, a very nice dinner, good ambiance (a bit noisy, but this should be expected), good service and we had a nice experience going there.
Tip - First Check-in with Foursquare would give you a free small guacamole when you buy two entrees.
