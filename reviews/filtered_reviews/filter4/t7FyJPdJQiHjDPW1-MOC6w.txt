This place in the somewhat new Container Park down in "old" Vegas is the right pick for authentic and crazy fresh tacos. 

We had tree different tacos with meat, pork and white fish and they where all supercrisp and very tasty with cabbage and great tasting cactus salsa that added that extra twist to the food. 

Beware if you ask for hot salsa on the tacos though as hot is really HOT in Mexico. We are used to very spicy mexican, thai and indian food but we where sweating after eating this salsa and had to flush it down with a couple fo extra beers. Yeah i know its a hard life........ha he.  All kidding aside. If you love tacos, just go. 
Thank me later.
