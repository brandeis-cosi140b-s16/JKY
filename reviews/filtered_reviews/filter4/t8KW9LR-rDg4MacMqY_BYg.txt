I'd give it a 3, my husband would give it a 5, so I settled on a 4.

The salsa you get with your chips is really tasty.
The drinks were very good.
My husband got the ribs. We would both say that the plate was excellent.

I got the chorizo stuffed chicken. While it tasted great, the chicken was VERY dry. It would truly benefit from an hour of brining. Also, I'm guessing they add while wine to the sauteed vegetables, to me it tasted too winey. The booze flavor didn't cook off. I just think they used too much. truthfully good sauteed vegetables don't need any wine.

My husband got a skinny margarita, he loved it.

I know we'll go back, but I wouldn't try the chicken again. It was so dry it tasted chalky. It's too bad because the cheese and chorizo filling was fantastic.
