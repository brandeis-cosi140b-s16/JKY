Chipotle - fast, fresh and always good. Whenever I am having a craving for a burrito, burrito bowl, or tacos, this is definitely on the top of my list. This location is tucked away in the back of the shopping mall, but there is plenty of parking and during lunch (around 12noon) it will get packed. I've seen people walk in and then out because the line was too long, so be sure to come a little bit early if you are in a rush.

The usual options are available for your choice - chicken, beef, barbacoa (shredded beef - a little spicy), pork. Now available is brown rice or white rice, and be sure to add the fajita mix (stir fried red onions and green peppers). 

They say there is a secret burrito menu, but still haven't found this. The only thing that I've tried is asking them to melt the cheese first (like a quesadilla) and then filling in the burrito - this way you get the melty cheese and the burrito wrap a bit more toasted.
