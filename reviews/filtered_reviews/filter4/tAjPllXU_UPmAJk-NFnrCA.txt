Like a little gem it's a small place but clean and cozy.  I just finished a hike at the Camelback and was starving.  I was craving for fish tacos so I consulted Yelp and oh what a find!

The guy works there is really cool.  He recommended the fish taco combo and the horchata.  The fish taco is so flavorful, and fresh.  It's a little piece of haven without feeling heavy.  And the horchata - just like the guy said, they make it really good here.

Hopefully before my trip to Phoenix is over, I will be back again!
