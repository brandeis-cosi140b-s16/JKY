I have become that person that does not experiment and am dead set on finding the best arroz con pollo in town. Havana Grill might not be as good as what I would eat at a childhood friend's house, but it was tasty. The rice was flavorful without being too salty or overly seasoned. The chicken was moist and fall off the bone tender. The plantains were cooked to perfection. The three pieces were soft, sweet, and not dried out. There have been many times where I go to a Cuban restaurant to be disappointed in finding that their plantains have the consistency of Styrofoam. The plates are large and can easily feed two people. I ordered this with a side of the steamed yucca. Yucca is a root vegetable that is mellow in flavor. It could have used some citrus to make it taste bolder. The onions on top adds a nice contrast in texture. So far, Havana Grill serves one of the better arroz con pollo I have had in a restaurant. My friend had ordered the chicken simmered in red wine with potatoes and olives. This was the better dish of the two. Served with black beans and rice, it is a great deal at $12.
