Had the 4 foot burrito here (it was free for our group, ask me how to get hooked up) and a few drinks. The beverages are a little bit more than standard off-strip establishments but not by much.

Chips and salsa will cost you $5 which is odd for a cantina to not just give them to you for free, but not a big deal. Chips are freshly made. Plenty of flavored and specialty margaritas available to choose from.

Service staff is on point (it was a slow Monday night after Super Bowl Sunday) and very attentive. They were playing some pretty sweet tunes

Place looked clean enough to me, I don't understand these folks saying it was dirty. Overall was a solid dining experience!
