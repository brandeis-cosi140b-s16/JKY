My wife and I went on a Friday night and made a reservation for 2 at 8:30 at about 4:00 that same day. I looked at the menu on line and it is pricy for small plates, but so the trend goes. We stayed in Phoenix for this trip and wanted to do some shopping and Old Town Scottsdale was recommended so the search for good food began. The Mission is pretty along with all the people that work here and many of its clients. Being from LA and in our 40's we didn't feel out of place;LOL.
The service was good although not outstanding, and the food was great but not a WOW experience. We had Squash tacos, Mahi tacos, Grilled Romaine Salad, Made at the Table Guacamole, and most notable the Poblano Grits. It is what it is; ENJOY.
