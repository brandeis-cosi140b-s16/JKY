While driving a cab in Vegas I'm always on the lookout for something tasty.  Not only for myself but something I think other people would enjoy as well.  Tacos El Gordo is the newest in that category.

The tacos here are really good.  While not everyone may be up for a lingua (tongue) taco, the el pastor tacos are really really good and so are the carne asada tacos.

Just the other week, I actually brought someone here in the cab who was visiting from Minnesota. He was originally from Mexico City and hadn't had a good taco that he didn't have to make himself for quite some time.  I brought him here to Tacos El Gordo and he was absolutely amazed.  He said the tacos here were the best hes had since he was back visiting family in Mexico.  Personally, I've only had tacos like this on a shopping expedition of sorts in Tijuana but I'd have to agree that these tacos are pretty awesome.

While the price of the tacos is a bit high (even more so when compared to the price in Mexico ;-) ) they're really tasty and you'll definitely come back for more.  A Taco runs about $2.00.  Small price to pay for a piece of happiness.

Bring your appetite and leave happy.  They're open late and are very quick.  The service is friendly and while there seems to be no rhyme or reason to the way their counter is set up, walk right up and get yourself some tacos!
