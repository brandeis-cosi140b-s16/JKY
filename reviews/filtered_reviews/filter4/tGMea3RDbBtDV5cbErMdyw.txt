One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Scottsdale. It is a small place; 4 tables and bar in main dinning room and 10 tables in the side room. But ask if there is seating outside. If you go out the front door and take a short walk to the back of the building through the parking lot, you will find a great patio and a second in door seating area. Great chips and salsa too.
