Stopped by for a quick bite to watch the baseball playoffs and had a really good meal at the same time.  The Chicken Tinga Taco with Jicama and Mango Salsa was awesome.  The Carne Asada Taco with pickled radish and salsa fresca was also very good.  My only suggestion is to make them bigger, since they are so good.  Also had the chips with 3 types of salsa that was bottomless.  

Service was excellent.  I'll definitely be back and based on the vibe, I need to check-out happy hour, since I bet this place is rockin'.
