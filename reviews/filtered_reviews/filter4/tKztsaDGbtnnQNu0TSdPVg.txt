I've eaten here 5-6 times in the last 3 weeks after hearing about it on Diner's, Drive-ins and Dives - I live in Ahwatukee and had just ignored this place until i saw the show.

I dig the food...the service needs an overhall (but from what I can tell so far, its a just one of the girls, everyone else seems nice). Like I said, I've been there quite a bit lateley and I've gotten the same girl at the counter on every occasion but once....and she is unfriendly to say the least. I've tried to be overly nice to her, say the order real slow, and repeat...and I barely get a smile from her and she has messed up my order twice (this is out of 6 times, so not a good average). She makes me feel like she's doing me a favor by allowing me to eat there...and it's made my wife not want to go back - the only problem...

...I can't stay away! In the sea of chain restarants in Ahwatukee and East Valley, its a nice discovery. 

So in short. Food good. Al Pastor burrito and tacos and tortas are killer. Green hot sauce in money.

Sevice horrible - I'm hoping someone from the restaurant will read this review and just sits her down...all she needs is to check herself and this place will be golden.
