Paleo language is a difficult one to translate to Mexican food. While much of the cuisine is beans, rice and cheese much of it is also fresh and full of flavor. Joyride offers an impressive taco menu. I was nervous to ask if I could order sans the taco shells- oh and sans cheese- oh and gluten free. Our bartender immediately reassured me it was NO PROBLEMO at all to accommodate my needs! I had three kinds of tacos the way I wanted along with a side of fresh guacamole and cucumber+orange salad. All freshly made and full of fresh herbs and veggies. Gracias Kate and Joyride!!
