The atmosphere at T&T is awesome. The servers are amazing, friendly, and eager to please! There is a full service bar and the tenders are talented and generous! With FREE chips and some of the best salsa on the strip you are just getting started. Quickly you will notice that for a Vegas Strip restaurant the prices are great! Between $10-$30 for appetizers to main dishes and they offer select combos so you can have an orgy of flavor on your pallet. The cooks are phenomenal whipping your meal up in a timely manner. Either way it wouldn't matter because the food presentation is like art. So well done you will want to snap a picture and frame it when you get home! 

You will love this place from the second you arrive. Especially if the mariachi band is there playing the hottest hits from the '80's. 

CHEERS!
