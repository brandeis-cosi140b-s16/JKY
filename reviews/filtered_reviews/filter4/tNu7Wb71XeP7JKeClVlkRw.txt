Amazing customer service, free samples of all the meats they offer and a fun and clean place to dine in at.

Santos Lucha Libre serves beef, pork and chicken which you can sample if you happen to be standing behind the glass with a blank look on your face (like I did). The lovely woman allowed me to sample each meats. 

My favorites were the adobada and the pastor, the spicy ones were great and packed with heat. All were flavorful and I ended up settling for 5 street tacos so I could enjoy most of what they had to offer here. The toppings for the tacos were great and were more up to your preference. I also got a horchata to wash the tacos down.

The tacos are like street tacos, definitely more aesthetic looking, flavorful and the meats so juicy and tender. The meats here are definitely on the wet side as they are shredded and seem to be braised for awhile in their own juices. Good tacos! The horchata you can pass on. 

The restaurant was so clean, lots of seating and was enjoyable to look around at the themed Lucha decor. The service was great and the people working here- feels like family owned, were so welcoming and kind.

I think the price is a bit steep for tacos/Mexican but the service, quality and cleanliness makes up for all the $ I don't really have- haha jk. Kind of.
