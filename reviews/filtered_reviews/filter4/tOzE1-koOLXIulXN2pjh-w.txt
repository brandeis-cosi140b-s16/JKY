YUM YUM YUM!!! This place is amazing. The focus is fresh delicious food. Everything tastes like it was made from scratch that day. Everything we've eaten had a distinct flavor so you can really get a feel for lots of different tastes. Whatever kind of "Mexican" you are in the mood for; this place will deliver. Nothing here ever feels like it was rushed to be cooked faster.

I have been here twice and the second time was even better than the first.

The first time we had 2 Cochinita pibil (pork) tacos, a Dogfish Shark taco and a Carne Asada taco. All of them were amazing with each having their own unique seasonings, complimentary accoutrement (pickled red onion for the pork, cabbage and creamy salsa for the shark etc.).

The second time we got a 'Dogfish Shark' taco, a chicken mole taco and a chicken burrito. The chicken mole was outstanding. My mouth is watering remembering it. It was a perfect earthy balance of the chili and the chocolate dancing on my tongue. The chicken burrito was also amazing in its simplicity. The refried beans are smoky and smooth in an indescribable way. The chicken was slow cooked and complimented the beans well. 

The horchata was very good- and not gritty or powdery or too sweet like many places. My only complaint (because nothing's perfect right?) is I would have liked more ice. Yeah- that's all I could come up with.

The variety of salsas makes it fun. The first time we went they didn't have the strawberry salsa we had read so much about, so of course we had to come back! We got the strawberry salsa and there was also the peanut salsa which I preferred to the strawberry one. Again the variety of tastes in the salsa is fantastic. The flavor combinations are unique and widely varied from sweet, to savory to spicy.

I work around the corner so will definitely be back for more!
