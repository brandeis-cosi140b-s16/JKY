9 out of 10 times, yelp gets it right, in my opinion. this was the one time they got it wrong! when i looked up reviews for Maverick, it had a 3 star rating, and I was almost sure I didn't want to eat here... but am I glad that my hubby convinced me otherwise.
The ambiance - so lively! on a Thursday night it was busy. mostly with bigger groups of 7-10 people. The ceiling is full of colorful lights, the music plays loud, and there's a digital JukeBox with the latest and greatest hits to take your pick from! Moving on to the drinks.. they have some neat drink specials, but I went with the Michelada. It was one of the best I've had till date. I got to try the chicken fajitas, which were somewhat non traditional. The dish doesn't come with the usual sides of lettuce, salsa, guac and sour cream.. instead there's a side of delicious charro beans, pablano green rice & Mexican street corn! I also tried some of the jalapeno mahi mahi tacos with a side of the spicy cilantro lime fries. a random interesting thing I noticed - they list all their vendors on the menu, that way, you know that your food is made from fresh produce and meats. I almost forgot to mention the friendly staff! Overall, it was a great experience, and I'm going back :)
