Came here with my girlfriend for dinner because I am a tamale junkie. The restaurant was very clean and the hostess seated us right away. We had an amazing server JESUS. The menu had plenty of selections for more than tamales. JESUS took our order and within 15 min our food came. Very hot and well proportioned. The tamales were fantastic being I am from the Midwest and love these types of tamales. My girlfriend had the chimmIchangas. Her dish the meat was a little tough to chew, other than that great flavor. We both dusted off or plates because we are fat and that is what fat people do. When the bill came I was very surprised at how expensive it was for 2 people. $42 DOLLARS. I guess I should have researched this place. I don't mind paying for good food, however that is not what was advertised here. Either way it was a great experience, not too crowded. EXCELLENT customer service, good food. cant beat that. I would recommend this location to anyone and ask for JESUS.
