Greasy, carby food always sounds good after drinking. Actually, pretty much anything tastes good after drinking...except for more alcohol.

We went here after a fun night at the club. The other location on the Strip was way too packed and we were way too hungry to wait 30 minutes to stand in line and find a table with other drunk people on the same mission. A 10-minute drive and wait at this location trumps that.

We got horchata, carne Asada fries and tacos al pastor.

Carne Asada Fries:
Even the small portion was a lot. Warm fried potatoes loaded with cheese, carne Asada and guac. 4/5

Tacos al Pastor:
Spicy meat. Yup, that's all I can remember so, I'm not even going to attempt to be descriptive about it. 4/5

We were the only Chinos in this area at 3am. It's all good.
