First time back since they changed the menu and I'm happy so far.  New menu is clean and simple.  Spanish/Mexican but done right.  Great taco selection and go to Mexican favorites.  Much more reasonably priced and I no longer feel overwhelmed.

So I got the chimichanga.  Crispy and we'll presented.  Love the spicy and tangy red sauce that covers it all.  Overall just a great flavor.  Let's me know I definitely need to come back and explore the menu some more.
