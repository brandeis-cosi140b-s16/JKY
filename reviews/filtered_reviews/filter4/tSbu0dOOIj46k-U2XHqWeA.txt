I've been here twice and both times loved the place. It's a bit small and looks like it was either an old Wendy's or Carl's Jr. that was closed down and rebuilt into Tacos El Gordo, so the seating areas are that of a typical fast food restaurant.

However, the food there is pretty good. It's one of the best taco places I've been to yet and it's decently priced. I believe it was a little over $2 for majority of the tacos, I personally liked any of the steak/beef ones as I do not eat pork, but from what my friend told me the spicy pork is definitely one to try. 

The Adobada fries are definitely something everyone should try when they first visit or never had it. It's actually really good. But if you're not with anyone or want to have tacos and the fries, I do however suggest getting the half order. The full order is about $10 but it is something that is either a meal itself or needs to be shared with at least 2+, otherwise you'll have leftovers to take home or a very full stomach!
