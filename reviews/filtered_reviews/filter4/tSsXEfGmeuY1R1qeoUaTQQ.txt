Love the atmosphere. Cute decor and great music. Service was ok. We had a super nice & knowledgable  server but the hostess had a bit of a snotty attitude when we asked for a high chair for our daughter. The food was good. I loved the chunky guacamole and the carne asada tacos! My husband had the fish tacos and said they were good but somewhat bland. I also had the blood orange margarita, nothing special there, except the price. $10 for a small &  mediocre margarita. That's downtown for ya. Wish they offered local deals....
