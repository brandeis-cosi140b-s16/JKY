I don't even know where to start with Z'Tejas.  I guess it started with the one on Mill, but we live closer to this one on Ray near I-10.  The one on Mill is great for people watching and I have taken visitors there straight from the airport when they are starving to death after their flight.  The menu has a wide variety of choices, something for everyone.  The service has always been a bit slow on Mill, but they also have been very busy when I've been there.  I love that they are usually quick in bringing out that wonderful warm cornbread to tide you over.

I prefer the one on Ray for happy hour and for Sunday brunch.  For happy hour a couple of 6th Street margaritas, sharing some tostada bites and the street tacos make my belly extremely happy.  The husband and I can fuel up before our shopping excursion to BevMo across the street.  

The barbacoa enchiladas have been a favorite of mine for years and it was a eureka moment when I discovered that for Sunday brunch they serve the same enchiladas, but add two eggs cooked to order.  That dish with two eggs over easy on top is positively moan-worthy.  Love it.  We've also tried the mac and cheese and it's really good, but really rich.  I recommend sharing that one.

I usually just stick with the 6th street margs, but have tried a couple of other drinks.  And I seem to remember some kind of white sangria cocktail that was very tasty.  I always look forward to going to Z'Tejas.  Been there about 15 times in the past couple of years and never had a bad experience.
