1.5 YEARS EARLIER

Him: "I heard about this great Mexican place in a gas station"
Me: (Scrunching  up my nose in disgust) "Mexican food ...at a gas station?"
Him: "Yeah we should try it sometime"
Me: (with heavy sarcasm) "Sure"

PRESENT TIME

After trying to think of somewhere new to take him for his bday, I finally decided I would try the "gas station Mexican" only come to find out they no longer have the gas station location (YAY!  I don't know why but Mexican food at a gas station just doesn't sound appealing!)  So we headed up north to Dasiy Mtn Road, easily found the location in the Fry's shopping center and then we just stared at the menu board!  There were a ton of options.. so we didn't even know where to begin. Ended up with a Texas Burrito, a fish taco and chicken tacos.  The food was very good, very fresh and very filling!  

This is a great little family owned place,  you can really tell the heart and soul that goes into the food and they really make you feel welcome when you come in.  Many people seemed to be grabbing the food to go while we were there.  This is a place I am sure we will be heading back to.. and probably not 1.5 years later!
