Just had my first meal at Los Taquitos.  Good stuff.  

More on that later but first let me rant about how insulted I am to see "safe" Mexican restaurants springing up that cater to squeamish diners.  For example, Mucho Macho Taco, Urban Taco, Phx Burrito House and Gadzooks, these restaurants don't serve Mexican food.  They serve canned Mexican themed food for people who are scared to go authentic.

Now that my gripe is out of the way, let me say first that Los Taquitos IS authentic.  It was my first visit so I tried all the staples that measure a Mexican restaurants authenticity - beans, rice, red chile sauce, lengua (beef tongue) and menudo.  Yes, I ate all of that PLUS a fish taco and all of it was good.

There's a bar with a decent selection of Mexican beers, and lots of different kinds of margaritas.  I saw some liquor bottles but didn't focus long enough to say whether they have a decent selection of tequila or not.

Finally, the other things I liked about Los Taquitos was the decor, clean bathrooms and, you'd think this would be more common, decent music.  
All of that adds to an enjoyable experience, and a return visit by me.
