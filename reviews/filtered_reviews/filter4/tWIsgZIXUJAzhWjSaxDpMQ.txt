Located on the outskirts of Old Town but definitely accessible without a car. Order your food at the counter. The server will bring your order to the table. Tacos are $2.5 bones. Traditional Mexican Food, beer, and Margaritas. There is a decent patio seating area in the back. Free chips and with good salsa. Service is friendly and fast. Food is definitely worth the short walk!
