Tired from a long flight in and stomach was in a different time zone.  We wanted to try something new so we went here.  Not too bad!  Friendly service, good prices, margarita wasn't bad, the patio was great to sit on but the happy hour stuff was nice!  

Lots and I do mean lots of people were rolling into here after work for happy hour.  We ordered some nachos as an appetizer that we could've had for a meal.  Cheese, beans, meat....they were loaded!  Loved my calamari taco more than the fish one and hubs enjoyed his big burrito!  The next table had some chicken wings that looked darn good too.

Then there was dulce de leche cake for desert!  Oh yeah..............
