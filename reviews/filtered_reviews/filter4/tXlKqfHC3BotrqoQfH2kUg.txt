I had never heard of "New Mexican" food but now am a fan! I have been there several times and have yet to be disappointed.

Just about everything I have ordered was amazingly good - your best bet is to order something you normally would not, you can't go wrong. (I have tried the following: filet tacos, chicken quesadilla, tortilla soup and the ruben's chicken fried chicken).

The best and favorite thing I have had was their basket of sopa's - I could eat an order all to myself! 

If weather permits, I would definitely ask for a table outside or take a seat in the bar (booth preferably). The other side of the restaurant was a little dark for me.
