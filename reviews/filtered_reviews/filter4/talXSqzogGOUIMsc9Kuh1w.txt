I might be harsher than some but to break down my review I'll give Joyride a 4 if not a 5 out of 5 for the atmosphere something I always find important but a 3/5 for the food (after my initial visit). I've known been a total of 3 times at the time of this review and can't say there isn't anything to dislike. I had heard about Joyride more and more from friends mentioning it on their FB walls and Instagram pics and finally made it there on a weekend. The place was quite packed but not so much that we had to wait to be seated. A nice and diversified group of patrons was there (families, 20 and 30 somethings groups of friends). Great mix.I've since come back. In terms of food I can't say anything about "The Standard" their chicken soft taco as well as the "Baja Fish" (I tend to lean on the milder side of things). I've had the Mexican street corn and black beans for appetizers and they were very good. The soft tacos are delicious, the waiters great and the whole mix makes for a place that you'll want to come back to.
