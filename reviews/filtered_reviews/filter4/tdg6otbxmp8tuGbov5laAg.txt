I usually frequent the Chandler location these days since it's closer to my house. This particular location has a broader menu so it's more fun to take out of town friends.  Like the other locations most everything is extremely spicy.  Although they actually have a few things that are not  hot and the non-spice eaters I have taken thought it was really good without being firey like the rest of the menu.  So if you have squeamish friends pick this location.  The food is great and always tastes like it's just prepared with great tortillas. The service is a bit slow sometimes, but the the staff is always very nice and the food and margaritas never disappoint.. 

The salsa is extremely hot at all their locations so warn your friends when you go.

Try:

- Chili Renos
- New Mexican Enchiladas
- Adovada
- Prickly Pear Margaritas
