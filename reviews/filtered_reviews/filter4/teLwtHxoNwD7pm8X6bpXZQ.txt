Great fusion of Asian and Latin American influences. Only tried the happy hour menu, however was pleasantly surprised at how carefully plated each dish was, as well as the care put into the flavors of each serving. Salmon rolls were delicious, so too the Korean skirt steak tacos. Fun, colorful, inviting decor added to a great experience. Well worth the visit.
