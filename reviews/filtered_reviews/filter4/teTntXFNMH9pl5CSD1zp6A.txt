The food here was unbelievable for fast, healthy mexican food. (no lard in the bean burro major plus)

ALTHOUGH the set up of this place is a NIGHTMARE. Parking is straight up unplanned, and when you walk in "it's like checking in at an italian airport" (-J. Donaughy) - there is absolutely no order.

I was probably the only person who wasn't smart enough to call in my order, and everyone eating at the restaurant looked like they were in hour 3 of their 4 hour lunch.
