I worked here as a hostess for a little over 2 years and never got sick of the food! Talk about real authentic Mexican food! Garcia's, Serrano's, and Macayo's have nothing on this spot. When you first sit down, you get served chips with 3 different salsas (the green is my fave!). The green chili enchilada sauce is amazing and the tortilla soup makes for a great hangover remedy! They also have great combination plates and parrilladas! For dessert, I would definitely recommend the sopapillas with honey! Part of me wishes I could still eat their food every day! I give them 4 stars only because they got rid of the weekend mariachi group.
