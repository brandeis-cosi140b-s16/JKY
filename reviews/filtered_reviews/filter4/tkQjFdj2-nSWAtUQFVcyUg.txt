Chino Bandido is one of our local favorites where I typically take out-of-state visitors. I like to showcase the Asian/Mexican/Caribbean fusion because it is so unique. You can order Asian food in a quesadilla or burrito AND they give you a delicious snickerdoodle cookie for free = munchies paradise. 

After being at both locations (Phoenix and Chandler), I can say without a doubt the Chandler site is much nicer and better kept. It's a little hard to find at first but I always remember it as being buried behind Walgreens. Pro-tips: if you've never been there, tell them! They'll hook you up with multiple free samples off their menu. You may also want to ask them for help ordering - it'll take you a few times going there before you get it, trust me. Free refills off the soda fountain (Pepsi).

I always order their flagship dish, Jade Red Chicken. It's like General Tsao's Chicken meets Orange Chicken - really, really good! Whether I order it stand alone, in a combo plate, or in a quesadilla or burrito just depends on what mood I am in. I LOVE their jerk fried rice, it's just the right amount of spicy and has amazing flavor. My girlfriend is a big fan as well. Their Emerald Chicken tastes light and refreshing. Their teriyaki chicken is OK. You can order refried or black beans - not that either is bad but I just ask for twice as much jerk fried rice instead (which they will do).

I highly recommend this place at least to say you've tried it. You get a lot of food for your money. Caution: as you continue to go here the wait for your food will start to seem like forever because you want to eat it so bad. The reason I believe Chino is four, not five stars is because it could be a little easier to order there and the atmosphere inside is kind of basic. There's so much space in there I wish they'd have a bar or better beer selection. Otherwise, the food is awesome.
