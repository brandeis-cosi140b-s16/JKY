This place is a true gem.  You owe it to yourself to give this place a try.

The Carlsbad Pasta is one of my favorite dishes in the entire city, and the Green Chile Burrito with their carne adovada is incredible.

They lose a star because you have to buy their chips and salsa.  That's the only knock I have on this place...it has become one of my favorite spots in the Valley!
