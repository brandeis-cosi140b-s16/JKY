Thank you Yelp. I just received an email with Yelpers' reviews of Burritos. Usually the recommendations are far and away or not fitting my food mood. However, La Condesa was right in my wheelhouse. 

The location is ok, but the interior is spotless and fun. Lots of Day of the Dead and Luce Libre to enjoy while you choose salsa from the 12 or so available. Did I mention that there are a lot of salsas? For a condiment king like me, this is heaven. Peanut and Pecan Salsa, WHAT!?! Both were tasty and new flavors. Mayan Cochinita Burro jumped off the menu. I had beverage ordering anxiety and caved to the Horchata. Best Horchata I've had. There are nuts, strawberries and other tasty floaters in it. The burro came, and it was lava-esque. I couldn't touch it for 20 mins. Luckily I had salsafest 2011 to keep me busy. The burro finally returned from the sun and it tasted delicious. Melt in your mouth stewed pork and refried beans in a possibly homemade tortilla. I'll be back. 

$12 Food, drink and Salsafest.
