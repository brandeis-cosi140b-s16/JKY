Thanks to DD&D for pointing out this little hidden gem. The place remind me of a dive bar that serves some gnarly food.
I had the taco combo which come with your choice of 4 tacos and 2 two sides.
-Pescado, Nice pieces of tempura battered fish with nappa slaw and guac. nice and refreshing
-Texano, barbacoa pulled pork with sour cream. had a smokey flavor to it. Just ok for me
-Bombay, Amazing flavors with chicken sauteed in yellow mint coconut curry finished with a Tamarind chutney curry. A must try!!crazy flavors for a taco but it works for me
-Shanghai, Another culinary success! Wasabi seared steak and the wasabi crema really stood out. This taco made me want to go beyond the 4 tacos i had into the food coma. I kept my composure and decided i will return very soon!
