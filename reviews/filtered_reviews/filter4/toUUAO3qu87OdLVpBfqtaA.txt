We've been living in AZ for 3 three and a half years, and have lived around the corner from this restaurant for two and a half of those years.  My daughter and I were starving and decided to go try their chicken tacos.  The whole experience was delightful; the lady who fixed our plates was as sweet as can be, the food was colorful, and we decided to eat outside because the weather was beautiful. We ordered sides of rice and salad-skipped the beans. The salad didn't have any "dressing", but it was garnished with tomatoes and other veggies.  After experiencing many disappointments with Mexican food out here, we have now found a place that we can coin as our favorite Mexican restaurant in the East Valley...so far :)
