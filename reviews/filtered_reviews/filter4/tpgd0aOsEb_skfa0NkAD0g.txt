I've been driving by this place for a couple years and a friend finally recommended it to me. I actually hadn't really paid attention to the signage and I thought maybe it was a Spanish nightclub because of the entrance in the rear, the parking attendant and you can't really tell anyone is there if you are only looking from the I-17 frontage road. Well, don't let looks deceive you. This place is great!

I've had Chilaquiles y Huevos, Machaca Con Huevos, Steak and Chicken Picado and some tacos. Everything has been delicious. The service has been great, even during the lunch rush. The portions are generous and the prices are appropriate.

Definitely stop by if you're in the area.
