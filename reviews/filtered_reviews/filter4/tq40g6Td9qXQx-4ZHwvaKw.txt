I'm sure most would think of this place for lunch or dinner. I must tell you.......don't leave out breakfast or their brunch on weekends. This place opens at 8:00 daily and for a good reason. On weekends they offer never ending mimosas and a make yourself Bloody Mary bar (never ending as well). Most breakfast spots have ridiculous waits on weekends. This place wasn't crowded and the food is amazing. 
The menu has so many things I want to try. Definitely have to come back for other things. They have a 80oz El Jimador margarita table top dispenser for $45 too! So many unique things. Come enjoy Nacho Daddy!!
Julie was a great server too!!
