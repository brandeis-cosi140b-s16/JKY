Needing a snack to carry us over to dinner, my wife and I stopped at this recently (4 days) opened location where we each ordered a single al pastor street taco.  At the expansive salsa bar, we (mostly I) helped ourselves to warm pinto and black beans, marinated carrots and grilled peppers/onions.  This location offers alcoholic drinks and is much larger with an upstairs room and is more upscale than their original location on Tropicana.  There is a good size help yourself salsa bar with salsas, warm beans, pickled carrots, grilled onions and peppers plus more.  

The tacos were very good, but we agreed there was not as much meat though I have given them a little slack because the staff was probably still in training.  

A few days later we make a 2nd visit, this time sharing 4 tacos; 3 al pastors and a chorizo.  The quantity of meat was better.  This was the first full weekend for this location so there were 2 customer service representatives helping people plus a DJ.  

A great addition to the Eastern Avenue dining scene.
