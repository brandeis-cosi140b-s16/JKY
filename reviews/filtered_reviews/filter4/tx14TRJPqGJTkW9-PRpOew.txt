The food is very flavorful and the fresh made tortillas are delicious. I like to order the sweet pork burrito or salad. Either way, get some of the cilantro ranch. That stuff can make any meal special. Sometimes we order chips and queso dip. They have a really excellent drink selection with the standard coke fountain products but take it up a notch with pebble ice and a selection of refillable drinks like strawberry lemonade, horchata, etc.

You order in a line similar to Chipolte. You ask for what you want and don't want as you go down the line. They have one guy in that line up, right after the burritos come out of the rolling oven that really tries to rush you, he's almost always there. Maybe he's mistaking the training to be "energetic" with being "pushy". If he could switch his "what do you want" style to "would you like to try" and give you a moment to think it would be a five star experience.
