Albeit a little pricey, the tacos are good and the queso fundido makes the trip worth it.

My favorites are the lobster tacos, the beer battered mahi mahi tacos, or the pork belly tacos.

The queso fundido comes out on a hot cast iron mini-skillet, with oozing, decadent melted cheese, some warm tortillas and your choice of either a wine braised short rib or mushrooms. Delicious.

Can be busy but pretty good for mexican food!
