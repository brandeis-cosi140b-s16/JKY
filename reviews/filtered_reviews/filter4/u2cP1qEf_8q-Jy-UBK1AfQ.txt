Yummy! I don't usually go for Mexican food but it was late, we were near Fremont Street Experience, and looking for some good cheap eats. The first thing you notice when you walk up to this place is the smell -- in a good way! Imagine the mouthwatering smell of a ton of roasting meat and spices wafting out into the parking lot preparing you for the tastiness inside. 

They offer a bunch of different taco fillings with unusual meat cuts such as beef head (cabeza) and beef tongue (lengua), along with the more standard steak and pork, all for $2.00 each. We got the cabeza, lengua, asada, and adobada. They were all really good, especially the adobada. The meat was very tender, and the seasoning was extremely tasty. 

We also tried out the fries, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're in a hurry because it takes them a while to make. It's probably better just order a few more tacos which you can get within minutes. But it did taste pretty good; it's got fries mixed in with a bunch of meat, cheese, guac, and sour cream. Definitely share with a friend because it is huge!
