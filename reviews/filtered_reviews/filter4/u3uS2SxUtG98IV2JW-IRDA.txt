Pretty typical Mexican fare. Reminds me of Chipotle. Came here for lunch, got the salad with Grilled chicken, which is basically an open faced burrito with lettuce. They make their tortillas fresh, right there at the counter. Although my salad came on a tortilla and it looked tasty, I didn't eat it because it looked like it had a lot of calories. The dining area and food prep areas looked clean from what I could see.

For the health conscious, I don't think they have anything that could be considered "Healthy" , even the salad likely has a ton of calories.

4 stars, I will return.
