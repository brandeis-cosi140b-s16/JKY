Okay, Yelpers, pack up your bitching and get with the program ... Vegas is stupid-expensive.  Get over it, go to Restaurants.com to get a discounted gift card, and then go to the Border Grill.  Yeah, it costs you an arm and a leg, but it's f'ing great food.  It's not Tex-Mex, you can't get it in your home town, but it's friggin' good and you'll love it if you realize that it's pricey and it's Vegas and it's awesome.  And if you can't get over the .50 for water, then just take a sip of the swill that Las Vegas Municipal wants to serve you and thank your lucky stars that Border Grill is setting their bar higher and serving some bougie stuff!
