My only regret about China Poblano is that I didn't go sooner. I've lived in Vegas for a few years and finally made it here on National Margarita Day. I had their signature salt "air" margarita. It's not really air, but salty foam that floats on top of your drink. Not only is it super cool and inventive, but it gives you a hint of salt in every sip. Delicious!

Even though Jose Andres, the Spanish chef behind China Poblano, is world renowned, I was curious to see how he'd do Mexican food. I grew up eating Mexican food and am very picky. All my cynicism was gone as soon as I read the menu. The queso fundido, a melted cheese appetizer served by nearly every Mexican restaurant, is made with queso Menonita. Most of you have probably never heard about it, but that's what queso fundido is SUPPOSED to be made with (not Monterey cheese most restaurant use.) To know Chef Andres has it imported from Mexico is really special. 

All the food we tried was great, especially the tuna ceviche. The one thing we had that was kind of blah were the tacos. That's why I'm not giving it five stars. You can find way better tacos in nearly every taco shop at a fraction of the price. Even the $10 lobster taco ($10 for one, little taco) was just okay. Nevertheless, I can't wait to go back again for margaritas and queso!
