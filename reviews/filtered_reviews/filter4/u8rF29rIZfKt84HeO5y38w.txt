We loved the Fideo! You get a small cup after you order. The chips are set at your table almost immediately wen you sit down. They have two dip options - refried beans, and a spicy red sauce. 

There's a salsa that is SO HOT, there's a warning and a disclaimer! Your server might let you sample it if you ask nicely, though. 

DELICIOUS plates, large portions, authentic decorations and chips to die for!

I'd go again.
