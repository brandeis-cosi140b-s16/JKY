I have not been disappointed nor do I think I ever will, with LOS TACOS on E. Charleston. Whenever I need that great tasting taco, Los tacos always delivers (figuratively speaking). Since they opened around the mid 90's (then known as La Taqueria) I have always loved their tacos. I think their Forte are the Beef Tongue tacos with the works (cheese, avocado, onion, sour cream, cilantro) and if you can't get past the thought of it being tongue, your missing out! There is a wonderful "house" green salsa in a bottle at every table, full of flavor and not too spicy it ads the perfect touch to the meal. They also have great fresh fruit drinks like cantaloupe and watermelon mmm, mmm, mmm. 
Lunch is always busy, since it's close to the downtown area, you'll see an array of people from the doctor to the attorney to the common folk like me, enjoying - no, savoring the mouth watering food. They have seafood, torta's, burritos, and other great Mexican Food. 
For lunch, the atmosphere is eat n go, but if you have the time you can enjoy the beautiful artwork throughout the restaurant. There's a Murial of well known actors from the 30's to the 80's on one wall and beautiful paintings hanging on all the walls. With a relaxed atmosphere and a jukebox in the restaurant so that you can choose some of your own music to play, and make it a more personal experience, I really love it. 
I've gone through their drive-thru a few times and it does take a bit longer than your average fast food drive-thru, but we're not talking about your average drive-thru meal. Authentic Mexican tacos, burritos and torta's take a bit longer to make than your average fast food place. Whether your in a hurry or have a bit of time this small n quaint restaurant has great food. With the tacos being a bit larger than average, and a bit more expensive too but worth every penny, I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for great Mexican food. Enjoy! =}
