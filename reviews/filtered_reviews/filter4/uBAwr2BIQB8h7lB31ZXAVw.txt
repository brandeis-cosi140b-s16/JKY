While staying at the Hard Rock my husband and I decided to try Pink Taco for lunch one day during happy hour...We started out with the house margaritas and the complimentary chips and salsa provided for the table.  I loved that the tortilla chips were actually pink!!  We ordered steak nachos and guacamole for our meal...and  everything was really great. The service was quick and the atmosphere was enjoyable. Planning to go to Vegas soon and Pink Taco is definitely on my list of places to eat!
