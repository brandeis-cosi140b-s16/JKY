Oh, Chino Bandido--I do love your irreverent takee-outee. I've sampled most of your dishes and now have my favorites. I fill out my slip with Diablo Chicken, Emerald Chicken, Jerk Fried Rice and Black Beans (extra Emerald sauce). 

As much as I love you, your entrees have slipped over the last couple years. The Diablo chicken has been a bit over-fried the last few times and lacking seasoning. The Emerald chicken (white meat, not fried) has been more than a tad dry. I still love you, but shape up, please. 

Jerk fried rice is consistent and, as always, yummy (especially with a little extra Emerald sauce mixed in!). The rock stars of the party are those mouthwatering black beans! I could stuff myself to the brim on those puppies. 

This DD&D joint isn't just a novelty. It is unique, delicious food in a crappy strip mall environment. No frills, but firefighters also love it (you know that's a good sign!). I'll also always love the complimentary snickerdoodle with every meal. 

I hope your entrees are just in a slump and will improve when the next cook takes over...
