A chilled glass of Dos Equis and fresh fried chips with salsa set the stage for my Cantina experience. I ordered the Chorizo Scramble and S ordered the Chilaquiles. My scramble had sliced avocados with a garnish of tomatoes and queso fresco. The chorizo was nice addition to this dish. What I truly fell in love with was the Chilaquiles. Two perfectly poached eggs nestled on a bed of tasty corn tortillas and salsa verde mix. It was a Round Corner Cantina variation of the classic Chilaquiles dish. I wasn't sure what to expect but was glad we went. I will be returning to try other dishes. Their cocktail menu looks promising as well!
