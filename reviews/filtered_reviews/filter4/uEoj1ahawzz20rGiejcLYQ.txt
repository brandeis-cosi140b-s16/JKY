DROP EVERYTHING!! MAKE NEW PLANS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT!!  Canteen Modern Tequila Bar is ready to open Thursday. Wife and I were lucky enough to snag a special invite last night from owner Julian Wright, and glad we did. Soft "training" opening with a simple menu, but simple done well is still DELICIOUS! Clean decor, with cozy padded seating, plenty of wood, rainbow mosaic tile, and a mix of sleek and rusted steel to balance it all. (Sorry no pics!) They may still tweak the menu, but our samples were mini tacos piled high with shredded pork, cheese, cilantro, and I think, guacamole spread. Spare ribs too, meaty, not too fat, with a hint of sweet. And the simple chicken wing, but big ones, also meaty, grilled with the perfect char. A great house margarita too, thanks to bartenders Clint & Dulia. We are downtown Tempe regulars and are sure to return this weekend. Loved it! I would have gone 5 stars but I am sure their best is coming........
