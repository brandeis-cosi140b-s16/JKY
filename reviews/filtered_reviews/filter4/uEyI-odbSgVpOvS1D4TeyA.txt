The first thing I got excited about when I looked at the menu was the presence of tres leches but I'll come to that later. I went here for Sunday lunch and the atmosphere was nice and friendly. Had the shrimp tacos with a side of beans and it was tasty. My friends also tried tacos, the breakfast burrito and the tamales and they were all happy. And yes, the tres leches....pure contentment.
