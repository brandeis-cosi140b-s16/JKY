Amazing food! I'm a bit surprised that other people have reviewed the service as being poor. Maybe I happened to get a great waiter. If the owners/managers for Hecho reads this, I just want you to know that Dana was a fantastic waiter. If you order the guacamole, they make it right at your table and it was so damn good!

Now to be fair, I don't have a lot of experience with non-Taco Bell Mexican food so I don't know if the food is objectively amazing or not. But I loved it. The portions were generous.
