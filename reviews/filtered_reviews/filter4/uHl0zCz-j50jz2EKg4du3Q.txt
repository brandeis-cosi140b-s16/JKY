La Comida is the New Las Vegas on Fremont Street East!  

Top notch service and a modern, urban huntsman design meets Mexico City's "La Condesa/La Roma" district decor greet the hungry diner upon entering this oasis of cool.  Buttery green tufted leather Chesterfield style banquettes line one section of La Comida, allowing patrons VIP people watching privileges while tailored rough hewn wooden dining tables dot the center of the dining hall.  Every detail in the design of La Comida has been considered and will not disappoint, including the stained glass cathedral windows that make up the presentation of the bar.

The service, starting with the reception desk and all of the restaurant team that we encountered, were La Comida's biggest and most impressive asset, what an incredible crew that has been assembled for this venture.

While decor and service are important, we had come in to enjoy a nice Cinco de Mayo Mexican food feast and for the most part, we were not disappointed.  While there were some dishes that were spot on, we found others that needed a little more refinement.  The chicken burrito, while chock full of tender pieces of shredded chicken, was overwhelmed by a spicy green chili sauce.  Others in our party of three enjoyed their tacos, guacamole, cocktails, real Mexican Coke and other specialties.  There has been some mention of the costs at La Comida, however, as an overall package - the food, fun, service and decor, it was well worth the expense. 

Thank you to the owners, management and the overall team for bringing the fiesta back to downtown.
