We had a great time at T & T. The food was pretty awesome, the sangria was fantastic. The atmosphere was casual but appropriately themed. The guacamole was soooooo good. I would definitely go back, except that it's in the Luxor which is just 'eh.'

Just a side note, don't plan on eating at T&T and then going out. You will be too full of cheese and beans and chips and Tequila and Mexican food to make it. Plus, it's really hard to eat "just a little bit" here since the food is so tasty.
