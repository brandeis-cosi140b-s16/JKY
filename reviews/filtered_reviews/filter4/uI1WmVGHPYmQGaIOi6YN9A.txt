Full disclosure:  It's probably getting a bump because it's so close.  That said, I was hungry, wanted Mexican, and Juan's did not disappoint.  Green Chili pork burro totally hit the spot - atmosphere was clean and welcoming.  Chili Relleno was good, not mind blowing, but certainly not the worst.  I'd go back for sure... In fact since its so close, I could see it being a go to spot for the south of the border cravings.

Which reminds me... I'm overdue for a So√±oran dog.
