This place does its best to replicate the Hispanic culture, food and beverage that Mexico provides.
       The wide assortment of tequilas, tacos and Mexican dishes entices one to return for a second time. The experience of authenticity is carried further by the music and colorful art surrounding the restaurant. Furthermore, the absence of cheddar cheese on the menu lets one know that this place tries hard to authenticate what Mexican food is really all about; flavor deriving from a multitude of ingredients. 
          Four stars goes to this restaurant despite its mediocre rating because there are surprisingly so few of these places around Arizona!
