In the culinary wasteland known as East Craig Road, this is the sole exception.  It is in close proximity to Nellis AFB so if you get here right at 11, you can have a quick lunch with your significant other!  Complimentary chips, beans, and salsa, friendly bartenders, colorful Mexican decorations, and live Spanish guitar.  

My wife enjoys the cheese enchiladas with chicken mole combo and I like the pollo correteado.  The sole drawback is the limited parking which I solve by parking on the otherwise of the adjacent gas station and Capriotti's.

One of the best Mexican Restaurants in Las Vegas, despite its location.
