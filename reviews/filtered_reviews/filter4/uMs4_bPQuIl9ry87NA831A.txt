I reviewed this new restaurant poorly about a month and half ago.  The owner was so kind to send me a personal note and ask if the restaurant could try again and make up for the less than stellar experience. We decided to go back and give it a whirl. 

So first off, I said it last time and I'll say it again, the margaritas were the best in town. Seriously, they are amazing. They are on "draft" and made days ahead of time and they are just by far amazing. 

The chips were delicious again and the guacamole, although not made table side, was delicious this time. 

This time, our reservation was taken on time and we were treated like kings and queens. We ordered a variety of the tacos to try different flavors and they were all amazing. The fish, steak, pork and chicken were all fantastic. We got full on tiny tacos but they were truly filling and actually just the right portions for tasting with your friends. The server checked on us often, the manager came over to say hi and they even treated our friend to a free desert since it was her birthday. 

One caveat, we did try to go early for a drink before dinner but unfortunately all the seats at the bar were taken and they really don't have an area for others to stand around and enjoy a drink. The hostess outside was less than inviting about the issue as well. So we did have to go have a drink somewhere else in Red Rock. A loss for the restaurant since we would have spent another $50 bucks on drinks for the group before dinner too. 

Overall, this time it was a win. I won't go back because they asked us to, I will go back because we simply want to. Hopefully, it will still be as good when they aren't expecting us, to do a make good. 

Worth a try.
