I would go as far to say that this is THE best burger you will eat in it's price range $3-4! Would be one of the best under $10 for sure.

The burgers are fatty and juicy, just like they should be.  There is a nice crisp to the edges of the burger that add flavor and consistency...same with the bread.  It is most similar to In N Out, at least in comparison to other burger joints IMO.  They have a real home cooked taste. and it is very enjoyable.  Check out the pic :

Ordered the chencho fries since everyone said to try them.  Sorry, didn't do much for me.  They come with chicken, cheese, and green chili on top of them, but the chicken is super tiny, and not grilled or anything, so they get lost in the sauce.  Grilling the chicken would add a nice consistency to the meat, but this is more like chicken in a can style.   I really like green chili, but I guess I don't really enjoy it on my french fries, and they got soggy pretty fast.  They weren't bad, but I wouldn't order them again.

Also, I asked for no lettuce/tom/onion on my burger, and they forgot about it.  Not a huge deal, but I haven't had an order wrong for quite some time.

And the neighborhood blows.  I won't hold it against them, but I doubt I will eat here after sundown LOL.   I will definitely be back when the sun is shining though!
