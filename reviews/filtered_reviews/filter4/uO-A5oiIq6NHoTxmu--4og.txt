Visited Habanero's for lunch yesterday and it was awesome! I had the Carnitas tacos - great flavor, fresh made guac and pico - YUM! My husband had a steak quesadilla and love it too. The service was fast and friendly. We will definitely go back. 

Our only complaint is the chips and salsa - the chips are great, but both of the regular red and green salsa's were really mild for our taste - still great flavor though. Will try the spicy version next time we go.
