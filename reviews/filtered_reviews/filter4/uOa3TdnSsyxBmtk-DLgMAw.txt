This place is located in the hotel at the corner of Drinkwater and Indian School.  I can't remember the name, because it changes ownership ALL THE TIME.  

First off, expect to spend lots of dough.  The portions, for the most part, are tappas sized, and you'll need to order at least two (at $10 a shot) depending on your appetite.  The flavors, though, are masterfully paired.  This place is definitely for foodies that appreciate chefs that actually COOK and CREATE.

The guacamole, again expensive, is probably the best I've ever had. It's not overpowering in spice, cilantro or anything...it's just fresh and mild and smooth and delightful.  I've heard if you check in on Yelp, that you get a guac for free, so look into that.

A pitcher of top-shelf, hangover-free, margaritas will set you back $60, but the food begs for a tasty cocktail to toast with your friends.

The parking stinks - valet for the most part. Look for free, open parking to the west of the property, or park in old town near the Grapevine restaurant and take a 2 minute walk.
