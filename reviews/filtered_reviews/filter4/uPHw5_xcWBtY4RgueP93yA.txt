El Encanto is a fun spot to take a out of town guest. It's located in the small cowboy town of Cave Creek. Upon entering the restaurant you are greeted by large ducks frolicking in the central man made pond.

The food and service is decent. I love their margaritas and always order the pollo fundido. Cream cheese and chicken nestled in a deep fried tortilla topped with more cream cheese sauce.

By the way, this place is huge, it seems like every corner you turn they have slapped in an additional dining room. Also, if the weather is decent I recommend sitting al fresco.
