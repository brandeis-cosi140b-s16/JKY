PRM is the place for Inexpensive fruits, a great-tasting torta (pollo deshuesado), refried beans, and succulent barbacoa y carne pastor.  Grab a strawberries and cream cup by the juice stand.  it's a great way to end a very tasty and satiating meal.  If atmosphere isn't important, save yourself mucho dinero by skipping Tradiciones and eat at the food court.  I tried to dine at the seafood counter twice, but both times the kitchen had just closed.  

To elaborate on the pollo deshuesado- I believe it's chargrilled chunks of chicken (wonderfully marinated and perfectly caramelized) with slices of tomato and crispy lettuce on telera bread.  Ah, telera!  So, so good!  I don't even recall any condiments added.  Just chicken, veggies, and the bread.  

Why not rate PRM five stars?  Two reasons: 

Bad guacamole- it tasted like water- so thinned-down, and yet at the same time had a congealed look about it.  PRM should be ashamed of itself for serving such a sub-par product!  Oh, well.  I shouldn't eat avocados anyway... 

Rice served has corn in it-  It's also served this way in the formal restaurant Tradiciones.  Don't get me wrong- I love corn, but my immune system does not.  Why not offer plain rice as an option?  Rice and beans make a perfect protein combo  Why deny me of it?

At least I can always look forward to the tortas.
