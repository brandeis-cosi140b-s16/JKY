Pros: 
1. Amazing delicious real mexican food. 
2. Best breakfast burrito I've ever had. 
3. The Guac is so FRESH and delicious. 
4. Great beer specials. 
Cons: 
1. Food is over priced for sure. $8.00 for a freaking XL carne asada. 
2. Kind of cramped inside. 
3. They need a spicier salsa. 

Overall, great food and customer service.
