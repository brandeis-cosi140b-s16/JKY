This place is about 2 miles from my house, I have driven past it at least 100 times in all the years I've been living here, yet I have never stopped...until they offered a Groupon.  I LOVE YOU, GROUPON!    We walked in the door, and the hostess greeted us immediately and sat us.  What an adorable place, very clean, low lighting, but not so low you can't see anything.  And the food, oh my, the food.  I had a stuffed chile rellano, so good.  And pumpkin flan, even better.  This is an adorable place with good service, fantastic food.  A little expensive for Mexican food, but definitely worth it.
