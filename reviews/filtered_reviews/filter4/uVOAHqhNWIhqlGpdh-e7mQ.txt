Located in the World Market campus, close to the outlet and Smiths Center.  I went here with Yelpers after an event.  Aside from good food, I am a sucker for nice modern interior design which Mundo has.  Plush seats, chandeliers, mirrors, flowers and splashes of color here and there.

We were given complimentary chips and salsa to hold us over before we got our entrees.  The service wasn't excellent but maybe part of it was because we were a group of about 18 people. I ordered the skirt steak tacos but I was given somebody else's food.  The steak tacos were good.  My sangria was a bit watered down.

For the steak tacos, fabulous interior design and location...4 stars.
