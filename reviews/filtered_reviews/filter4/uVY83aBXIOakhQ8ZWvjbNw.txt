Yummy yummy!

I met a friend here for my birthday dinner the other night. How have I never been here before I said to myself. So cute! The Clarendon Hotel is awesome looking too. 

We were seated a little tardy however, but I will over look that. Everything the hit the table was awesome! From my wine, to the tacos to the grilled corn on the cob my friend got. 

We started with the chips and guacamole, they also brought over two kinda of salsa. Both were great, one a bit spicier than the other one that was a green salsa. After a few bites we picked out our entrees. I got a pork quesadilla, halibut mini taco and she got some rice and bean and the grilled corn on the cob. My absolute fave has to be the corn. It is grilled on the cob then slathered in butter, Parmesan cheese and some spices. To Die for! I want to go get some right now. 

A mist try if you are in the area!
