We visited Pancho's for the first time today.  I really liked it.  I LOVED the d√©cor, it's really cute inside, with an indoor patio feeling with lighted trees and colorful tiles and a fountain.  I bet it's pretty at night - will have to go back and check.  The staff were all very nice, from the host staff, to our server & busser.  I ordered Enchiladas Suizas, and they were very good.  My brother had a Quesadilla with Chorizo & Eggs, and he said that was also very good.  As some others have said, it was a little pricey, but that is not a particular concern of mine.  It is also a little noisy, but not too bad.  I recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind the high prices.
