LOVE the food here. This is coming from someone who found his perfect personalized combo (jade red chicken burrito, bbq pork quesadilla) and usually orders the same thing every time. Although, I've noticed a strange pattern, whenever I end up taking a first timer here: if they end up ordering anything other than what I recommend, they usually have anywhere from a mediocre reaction to flat-out hating their meal. Emerald Chicken, ordered alone, has consistently been rated to me as tasting like "cat food." Then they taste my burrito or quesadilla and say "That's amazing! I should've ordered that!" I do think this place needs some kind of a makeover. The Phoenix location, while feeling a little run-down, at least has some personality to it and feels welcoming. Also, something has to be done about the ordering system. Sure, it's not rocket science, but it's gotta tell you something when every new customer that walks through the door looks completely dumbfounded. Despite these criticisms, I do recommend trying it out. I mean, come on! Mexican/Chinese fusion! How often do you see that around?
