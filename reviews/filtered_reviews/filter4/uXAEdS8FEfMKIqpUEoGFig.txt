This place is just great. Love the interior & ambiance. They make some awesome drinks - my favorite being the Dark & Stormy. The salsa and guac are tasty and just right for munching on at the bar. 

My suggestion for tacos would be the Pork Belly. It seems that the salsas that accompany the different tacos have been thought-through and really compliment the protein (or veggies) you choose. 

I think I'm a bit biased because my wonderful boyfriend took me here on our first date. It's a great date spot. But maybe I just think so because ours went so well! Either way you should definitely check it out!
