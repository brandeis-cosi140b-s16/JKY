Yelpers did a taco crawl and this is our stop number 2. 

Since the carne asada seems to be the most popular item, the BF and I decided that to try that out. You can get the basic with just some meat, onions, cilantro,pico or you can do "with everything" which is avocado and crema which is $1.50 more. There was some beans in there and I'm not sure if that is something that comes basic or part of the "with everything" since it's my first time. Overall this was tasty, loaded full and big of a taco so I didn't feel that it was a rip off at $4.50  for one. I love the double tortilla with crispy cheese between as it lends another texture to the whole bit. That's definitely something that sets this apart is there is a lot of flavors and texture play. The green salsa bottles on the table look a bit suspect, but its garlicky and zesty good so I'll risk food borne illness and squeeze some onto the melange.

Apparently the seafood cocktail is great here, but it looks huge so we got a tosada de ceviche fish instead.  I was wondering why it was taking a bit, but it looked like from where I was sitting she was mixing it up fresh and cutting up the avocado? It was pretty good as far as ceviches go. 

Overall pretty good. I would go again and glad there are a few locations around town in case I want a unique taco.
