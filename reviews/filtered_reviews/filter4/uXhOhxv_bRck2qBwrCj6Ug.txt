Came to check out this new addition at Scottsdale Quarter, and I'm glad I did. Love the decor, the live music on a Tuesday night, and of course, the food! 

Menu was simple, choices of the usual Baja mexican food, with emphasis on their special a-la-carte tacos, which ranges from $5-$10 each, definitely on the pricy side for just one taco. I had the grilled fish tacos (specialty plate) which came with two tacos, mexican rice and black beans, like the standard, I'd say the tacos weren't spectacular like I was expected, but still decent. However, our order of the mixed seafood ceviche and the carne asada quesadilla were wonderful! The ceviche was very fresh and well-seasoned, probably the best of the night.  The quesadilla came with a creamy chipotle sauce which was a nice add-on. And the plate is really big, definitely a shareable entree.

Service was great! One little drawback was that we had to wait for a table for 20mins on a Tuesday night, around 6:40pm, under the bright sun that their blinds by the patio didn't really cover, yes, it was very hot... they need those patio misters.... this being said, make your reservation before heading there, especially on this hot summer!!
