Had lunch here today. Ordered the taco and tostada combo with rice and beans... The service was quick, the food was great, and the atmosphere was dark and soothing. The building is a little older and slightly run down, but it has character.

One little ding - We got here a little before 11am (when they supposedly open) and they didn't open the front door until 11:05am (per my cell phone). Grrrrrrr - don't get between a hungry man and his tacos!
