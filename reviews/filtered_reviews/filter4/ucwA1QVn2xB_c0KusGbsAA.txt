This place is amazing! It's the equivalent of a Hawaiian style take on chipotle but 1000x better. You have your choice of burrito,tacos, or bowl. Then your selection of meat, toppings & sauce. The great thing is they let you try the meat before you make a decision. I went with the steak and the pork.  For my first time trying Hawaiian style bbq meat.Boy was it tasty and flavorful!  Since I decided I would make a bowl. I chose seaweed brown rice, corn salsa which I think was med or mild spice. Can't remember  but it was phenomenal.  Your reg toppings  of lettuce,lime,shredded cheese.  They have different  types of sauces they make in house. I went with the pineapple mango habanero.  Sweet with a nice kick from the habanero  sauce. 

As it was my first time ever going here the cashier (I wish I remembered her name. I know she told me she moved from cali.) She was so friendly and we'll mannered. Anyhow she gave us a sample of the coconut bark.  Make sure you buy some of this! It's like a short bread cookie with one side covered in dark chocolate,the other in caramel nd shredded coconut sprinkled on top.I'm not a big fan of dark chocolate  but the combo of the caramel and coconut. Omg! Amazing. Needless to say I brought  1/4 lb after devouring my sample to bring back home to ny.

 This is the original location and we met the owner who is looking  to expand! He was nothing short of great! Very enthusiastic and polite at the same time. I hope someday you open a restaurant  in ny! I'll be sure to be first in line. When I return to vegas this will always be one of my go to food spots!
