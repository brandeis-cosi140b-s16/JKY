Bean dip and salsa was quite enjoyable. A little expensive but worth it. Guacamole was awesome very sweet. The food was fast and really delicious, and the food presentation was nice. They even put the sour cream and guacamole in little bowls made out of chips. Our server was friendly and very helpful, making sure our meal was enjoyable. To end the meal we ordered the fried ice, which was amazing. I will definitely be coming back again.
