Bakery, groceries, and lunch.  Great combo.  Don't let the address limit you.  We visited for lunch before 1pm, and didn't experience any lunch crowd.  Plenty of seats.  I had a combo (Tamale, taco, tostada) which was too much food.  My friend had the Mexican Pizza, which I'll be getting next time I visit.  Soon I hope.  

P.S. If you like hibiscus tea, you can get the leaves here to make at home.
