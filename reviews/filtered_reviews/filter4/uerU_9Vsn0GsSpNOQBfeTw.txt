WOW!! Glad we finally made it to Los Taquitos!
We came for our 1st (and certinaly not last) visit to LT and gotta tell ya - there is a good reason there is a buzz around it!

The Carne Asada was very tasty in my street tacos, the carnita and pastor meat were very tasty and tender.  Their "hot" sauce in the bottles on the table is a good blend of taste/sweet with a little heat.

Can't wait to go back and try more from the menu!
