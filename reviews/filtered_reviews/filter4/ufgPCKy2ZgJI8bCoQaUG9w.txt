Amazing Mexican and Asian infusion with good service.  We saw this as we were driving and I'm so glad we stopped.  Everything was amazing and we tried a lot. Order many plates and share because everything we had is worth trying. Blanca was our server and was a great help with suggestions and making sure we had everything we needed. She was so patient while we kept adding on more and more. Come hungry, there will me so much for you to try. The mexican street corn with popcorn is amazing. The steak pepita torta was mouth watering. The rolla chingon was amazing and unique. The korean tacos are a must. Love the atmosphere here.  A very eclectic place with lots to choose from including drinks. The loaded mule was refreshing. The tres leches cake I'm eating right now and all I can say is Wow!
