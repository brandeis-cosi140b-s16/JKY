Great place for good food & great drinks! The CW margarita was so good! I ordered the lobster enchiladas they were ok I probably wouldn't order them again though. I think the drinks are way better than their food. Also the music they play is great! Makes ya wanna get up & dance! We like going here for a chill experience which you will get!
