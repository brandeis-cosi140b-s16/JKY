I had never been here before today. Had the special w/o the beer battered rye bread (GF) - the burger was topped with havarti and pastrami brulee and a Brussel sprout slaw. It was topped with a jalape√±o aioli. Really good. Had the seasoned fries which were just okay. My friend had the Country Burger and he enjoyed it. He had the sweet potato tots and I wasn't sure if they were breaded but I did try one and loved it. Overall I would definitely go back.
