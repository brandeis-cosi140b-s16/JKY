We were trying to go somewhere quite close to home. Honestly can't get closer than this. We were greeted right away by our server Martin. My husband had many questions about the special. It was shrimp tacos with jicama slaw. He did not know what jicama was. Martin took his time in explaining what it is. 
We started with the chips, salsa and beans. Very good way to begin. We ordered the fresh guacamole. Also quite delicious. My DH had the special, I went for the albondigas soup and a salad. The soup came in a huge bowl. Honestly enough for two people. The flavor was subtle and perfect. The meatballs plenty  and delicious. The salad was fresh with cucumbers ,romaine, tomatoes and queso fresco cheese. I took half of both home. 
My DH ate every bit of the special. Loved the jicama slaw. 
The portions are generous, the service outstanding. Priced right for the amount of food. We will be returning.
