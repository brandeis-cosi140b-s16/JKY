It's Vegas, people, so expect everything to be expensive.  This place is one that you would actually remember not for the price, but for the food.  It's a weird fusion of mexican and chinese.. weird, but it worked.  The drinks were awesome and STRONG; the food was delish and yummy.  Definitely a place to go for lunch/late lunch/dinner.
