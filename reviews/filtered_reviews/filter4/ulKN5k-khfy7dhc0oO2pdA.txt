Really tasty new taco joint in town! Servers are really friendly and they have great beer on tap. Love the atmosphere here. Their chips and salsa are A+ and they just kept slingin em our way. For every 3 tacos you get, you can get a side for free (hells ya) so if you're with a group, I say order a shit ton of tacos and try all the sides you can. 

I had the Cochinita Pibil and Shrimp tacos, I've had better Pibil but the shrimp was incredible. I've heard great things about the ahi taco and veggie ones too. I also got to try the beans, slaw, and orange/cucumber salad. All very good. 

Also, valet parking which is nice.
