What a gem. This place is just true blue delicious.

Let me put it like this, everytime I have gone there for some reason a bunch of Firefighters were eating there. Firefighters love good food and eat a lot but do not make a lot of money. If this place fits their needs then it exceeds mine.

I always get one of the Tortas and usually take a few Churros with dulce de leche filling.

This place is just genuine.
