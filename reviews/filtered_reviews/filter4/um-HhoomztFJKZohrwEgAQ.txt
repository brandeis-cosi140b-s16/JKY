The food is actually really good here, the only thing is that you need to pick the right from the wrong.  I have gone here 2x now.  The fish taco (tempura covered) was super fishy tasting and almost like it went bad....  the spicy pulled pork tacos are my favorite.  Black beans had great taste, just a little salty.  The chips and salsa was very good!
