Well, they sure are friendly.

But speedy they are not.  The food that is, I wouldn't suggest stopping in if you're in a hurry but if you have some time to kill, the decor is nice and they don't rush you.

We had breakfast, the burrito is pretty good sized and the potatoes were crispy.  The yogurt and fruit plate was actually good sized as well.  Food was good, the pico on the burrito was sweet rather than spicy, but no complaints otherwise.  

Solid 3 stars for the food.  5 for the service.
