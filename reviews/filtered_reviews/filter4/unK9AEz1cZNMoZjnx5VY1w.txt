Definitely a cool bar in Lawrenceville, and one of the best places to get a cocktail in the 'Burgh.  It certainly has one of the most eclectic crowds around.  Everyone from the hipsters to punks to older people dressed up are inside...you'll feel instantly comfortable no matter who you are.  The cocktails really are great.  As a guy who really appreciates good ingredients and a well-crafted mixed drink, this place doesn't disappoint at all.  Service is...ok.  My experiences have been pretty underwhelming so far, but the rest of the bar makes up for it for the most part. Unfortunately, I haven't tried the food here yet, but I've heard good things.  Its a very cool late-night spot overall, with a really cool atmosphere and great drinks.
