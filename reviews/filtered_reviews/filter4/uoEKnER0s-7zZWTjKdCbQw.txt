Going through the mail one day and ran across a coupon for Valle Luna.  Then I went to Yelp to check out the reviews.  Reviews were mixed, but hubby and I were craving Mexican so we decided to give it a try.  We arrived there and the parking lot was packed on a Wed.  Turns out, they have awesome dinner specials on Weds.  The wait was 20 minutes, 10 minutes later our table was ready.  Waitress (sorry, can't remember her name!) was awesome.  I told her it was our first time and she explained the specials.  Chips and salsa arrived with our drinks.  The chips were hot and not greasy, and the salsa had a nice heat to it.  These were the best chips and salsa I've had.  Waitress comes by and takes our order and asks if we had a coupon - which I totally forgot I had. I told her I didn't know if it was a better deal if I did the Wed dinner special or took advantage of the coupon.  She said that normally, the coupon is a better deal.  So she takes our order and leaves.  5 minutes later she stops by and says that the she ran the check both ways, and the coupon is a better deal.  WHO DOES THAT!!!  That is awesome. 10 minutes later, our food arrives popping hot.  Hubby had the fajitas and I had the machaca chimichanga.  The portions were big.  The food was delish, not too salty, seasoned perfectly, and not too greasy.  The rice was moist and fluffy - normally at other Mex restaurants, they are dry.  Our drinks were refilled consistently.  Overall, great food and great service.  We definitely will be back.
