Excellent inventive tacos, I haven't had anything that wasn't very good here.

The Mexican street corn is wonderful, the pitchers of copper are a good price. Their pitchers suck however (from a physics standpoint) and will spill easily half a beer or more on the floor no matter how you or the waitstaff pours. After many a beer lost we found out there are a limited number of lids that fix the problem completely, ask for one.

Service has been either excellent or mediocre. (After we were told "It's okay, it was all foam anyways" while our waitress poured a good pint of copper on the floor while we shed a tear, unfamiliar with the specials we knew existed, Versus our skilled unflappable waitress who made sure we didn't spill on ourselves and handled a group of twenty voracious consumers of food and drink on her lonesome with constantly refilling pitchers, chips, drinks, water, salsa, etc etc.)

Edit: Since I bashed another taco place for not having it, praise for Maverick for offering free very good chips and very good salsa! Appreciated!
