Great prices on a la carte items. I had the chicken enchilada and it was very tasty! Right up there with the best I've had! The pork stew had a good broth base with carrots and potatoes and was simple but had complex flavors that worked! Joey provided exceptional service and I will definitely be returning and trying more items on the menu. :)
