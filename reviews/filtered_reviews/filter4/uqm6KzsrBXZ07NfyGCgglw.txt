In Mesa to defrost for a few days and wanted Mexican food.  Got pointed to Casa Ramos by Yelp! (thanks).

Our server Marsha was attentive, friendly, and professional.  5 stars for her.

The outside of the place doesn't inspire confidence - on the other hand, you don't eat outside.  The decor is, well, kitchy. 

The place is clean, the food is really good, and the people are friendly.  Portions are large.  Food is hot (including the chips).  The salsa was was better than a chain Mexican place.  All that and the prices are very fair.

Well worth a visit.
