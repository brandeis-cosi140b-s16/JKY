My girlfriends and I had a great experience at isla.  Located in the treasure island hotel.

We were in town for my girlfriends 24th birthday we had dinner here on a Saturday night not a long wait at all we started off with the best strawberry margarita I've ever had with real strawberries blended in! delish :) some chips salsa guacamole and for my entree I had the steak tacos they were great! 

Management came over multiple times to check up on us I think he had a crush on the birthday girl ;) our waiter was fantastic split our bills 5 ways. Definitely recommend.
