Was very skeptical when I first walked in.  It was 7:00 pm and only one other table of people. The menu though looked very interesting so we ordered up a few dishes and some cocktails.  I can't remember the name of the dishes but mine had three small corn tortillas with flat iron steak that was nicely marinated and tender with some fresh avocado slices and cilantro.  My husband had some mahi mahi mini tacos.. The fish was very fresh and not over fried with a nice dressing of fresh mango.  The best part of our meal was their bread pudding with a whiskey and caramel sauce that was out of this world.. I could of had a big ol' dish of that for my meal, it was that good!  We are in the Scottsdale area about three times a year so we are definitely going back to this place.
