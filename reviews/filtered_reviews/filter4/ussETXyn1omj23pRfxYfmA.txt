Went here again today for probably the third time. Got the buffalo brûlée burger and fries. The burger was absolutely delicious, and so were the fries! The burger was one of their weekly/daily specials. When I have visited previously I've primarily ordered from the regular menu but from now on I will be getting the special! The fries are slightly sweet which was actually really yummy!
