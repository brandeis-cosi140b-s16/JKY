Since moving here, I needed to find the perfect "special dinner" place. You know what I mean, we all have one. It is our go to place for a special event, birthday, date or family visit. And while I have not had that many special events yet, I have had some family visits. And my parents only stay at the Saguaro hotel when they come to Phoenix. But more on that later. 

So whenever they are in town, we will go to The Mission. It is just a great place for a nice dinner without it being too stuffy. While every meal I have had there has been great, I cant honestly remember what I ate. But I do remember the guacamole. As a fat foodie, I love when a dish is prepared table side. And they do this for the guacamole, and it is the best guacamole I have ever had. How do I know this? I hate guacamole. I try to never eat on purpose, but when I go to The Mission that part of me dies. And I inhale this stuff. So you have to try the guacamole is what I am getting at. And order their house margarita or their Blood Orange margarita (if it is still on the menu). Another thing that becomes costly, because they go down so smooth and taste so good before you know it your a little drunk. 

I have never had service problems. And both times I have gone, it has been packed. And while it does get loud, you can still hear yourself. Try to get a seat outside in the back. Nothing fancy about it but it just a great outside setting that is not patio or Jimmy Buffet themed (sorry, tex-mex places with outdoor seating usually go down the Buffet route). 

Also the drinks are not watered down. Trust me.
