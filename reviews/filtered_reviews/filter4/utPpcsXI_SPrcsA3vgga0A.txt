I love this place.  It's amazing how delicious a simple bean and cheese burrito can be.  Their red sauce is perfect, their green chile is to die for, and their strips + cheese are amazing.  When I go, I usually get the mini burritos - because I like to have both the bean / cheese & green chile.  If you like Mexican food, go to Elmer's and you won't be disappointed.

I also give credit to their location, and their student prices, getting all those Chandler High students addicted to their tasty food early on creates nostalgia for their taste buds & guarantees "for life" customers.  Bravo.
