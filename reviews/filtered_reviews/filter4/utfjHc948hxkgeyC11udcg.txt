Great food a true south of the border place. Went in for lunch and a late breakfast today. I had the Carlitos Burrito (steak) with red sauce. Really really good. My wife had the Huevos Rancheros for another great meal. These were both what I expect to get in the smaller restaurants along the Baja while off road racing and visiting places. Best Mexican food in Vegas. Place is small and always crowded but worth the wait.
