Solid 4 stars, the food is almost 5 stars. The decor and dish ware are lacking but it's a hole in the wall what do you expect?? First visit was two weeks ago and I took the family back twice since. It's definitely worth checking out...oh yeah, $3 house Margaritas and $4 small pitchers of beer-----good times
