One of the best tequila selections in the valley. Also the taps are non discriminating with an ample IPA selection. The service is usually great with some of the most friendly bartenders in the valley. The only downfall is some of the food items. The specials are very reasonable but outside the nachos, the menu tends tone hit and miss
