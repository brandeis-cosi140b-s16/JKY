The food is fantastic, but the portions are disappointing.  You're paying for the quality of the ingredients at America's Taco Shop.  The food is not that expensive, but you're going to need to order more than you think you need to if you want leave feeling full.  Just be ready to spend a lot more than you thought you would at this dive.

I had the carne asada burrito and pastor taco.  I love that there's guacamole in the burrito, and the caramelized onions are great.  The burrito is fantastic, but a little smaller than I'd like for $6.  There is an XL option for $1 more.  Maybe I should try that next time.  The taco was also really good, but also small for $3.  All sides, including chips and salsa, are going to cost you extra.

My taste buds were certainly satisfied.  The food's quality is superior to any of the upscale fast food burrito chains (it may even be better than many full service restaurants), but you'll get a lot more for your money at those other places.  Your options for everything is steak, pork, or veggie.  I probably should have asked this while I was there;  But what does America's Taco Shop have against chicken?

The restaurant is small.  It does feel a lot like a little cantina somewhere in Mexico. There's very little room inside.  The patio seems like an okay spot, but I wouldn't want to be inside or out on a hot summer day.  The parking situation is really bad.  The lot is tiny.  Your best bet is to skip the lot and just find room on the neighborhood streets.
