I've been here twice and enjoyed the food both times. Yesterday I had some stuff off the brunch menu. The churo tots, spicy chicken tamale, and the biscuit with chorizo gravy were pretty good. The plantain empanadas are amazing! Definite must. My 4 year old daughter has gone with me on both visits so it is a restaurant you can take your little ones to. For mother's day they gave moms a red stem rose which I thought was nice.
