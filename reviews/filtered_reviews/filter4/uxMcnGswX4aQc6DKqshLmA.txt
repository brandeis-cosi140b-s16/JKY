The food and service was excellent and the decor was nice.   It seems like this is a hidden gem just off the casino floor.

We had the Chile Relleno and Pork Carnitas for our entrees and both were excellent.

Only negatives the Sangria was a little weak and the air was smoky from the casino and bar.
