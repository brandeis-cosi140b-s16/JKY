(Dined for lunch on 7/4/14)

Understandably popular and busy Tex Mex located down the events center corridor in Mandalay Bay. It's been here since day one of the resort, which says they're doing something right. It's a nice colorful interior and it feels airy despite the fact that there are a lot of tables. Things are placed just far enough apart that you feel part of a group without your neighbor being in your lap.

We went the taco route for lunch and they were quite tasty, with the spicy shrimp being the standout. On the three-taco plate, you can mix and match types. The plates come with black beans as well as white and green rice. The chip basket that comes to the table has three salsas, all tasty. When our waiter noticed that we liked the spiciest best, he brought us a dish of another, even hotter salsa to try, which made for a nice personalized touch. In fact, he gave the impression that he genuinely cared about our dining experience. He took care to lead us through the extensive margarita list and gave us some good advice and was correct in his recommendations--the margaritas are delicious! His extra time paid off for him too, since we each tried two margaritas based on his descriptions. The ultimate tariff is kind of high for this type of food, but the quality is on the high end and, of course, it's in a resort.
