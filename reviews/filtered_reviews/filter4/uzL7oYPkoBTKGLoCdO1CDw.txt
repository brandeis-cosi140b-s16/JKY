Located right across the street from The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino.

Fantastic food and large portions. My girlfriend and I both ordered the Street "Carnitas" tacos along with a side of rice and beans and could barely walk out of that place once we finished. 

-1 star as our waitress had the attitude of cool piss the entire time. Either way she provided good service and was very attentive despite her poor attitude.  We tipped her well as we waddled out of the restaurant.
