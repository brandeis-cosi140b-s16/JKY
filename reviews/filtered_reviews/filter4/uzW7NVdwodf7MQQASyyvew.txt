It's a little bit hidden in New York New York casino, but it's a gem.  The drinks are strong and the portions are both high-quality and generous.  Our waitress was also very friendly.  

I would recommend sitting on the "patio," which is still inside (there is not exterior patio), but you get to look at the NY NY roller coaster and "sights,"
