It was nice to get real tacos. 

There is not alot of variety; but what they do they do in bulk. 

I ordered the tacos de nopales, tacos de suadero, y tacos de tripa. They included a generous helping of cebollitas on the side. 

I will say that, due to the heavy traffic, the tacos are a little greasier than I would generally prefer . Everything was fresh; and well prepared. 

I was suprised that, even though they were on the strip, they charged regular taqueria prices.
