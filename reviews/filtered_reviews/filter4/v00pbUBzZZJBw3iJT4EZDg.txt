I love the patio and overall decor of this new location. Its close to nearby Biltmore area so I find myself in the area quite a bit. The salsas they use here are spicy! I love it but others might not be able to handle the heat. The house margaritas is one of the best in the valley in my opinion. They had a good selection of mexican beers on draft: dos equis lager, pacifico, victoria, negro modelo. 

I always get the carne adovado which is a slow roasted pork in red sauce. Its wrapped in a soft tortilla and topped with cheese. It pretty much melts in your mouth with the right amount of spice. The enchiladas here are also very good. Overall, this place tests less greasy and with none of the weird aftertaste I get with other mexican places like arribas,etc.
