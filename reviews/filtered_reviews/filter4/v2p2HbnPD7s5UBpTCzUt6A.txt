When they say Dick's is hard to find, they aren't kidding, but it's worth hunting for! Both the breakfast quesadilla and the enchiladas and eggs were outstanding, and there were a ton of other menu items that sounded delicious. The owner even came by our table and was very friendly.

I'm knocking off a star because the service was a little slow at times, and our decaf refills were only tepid, but we'll come back for sure.
