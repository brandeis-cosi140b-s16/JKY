One of the reasons I like Yelp is the opportunity to find small, local places you would seldom be able to find on your own.  Dick's Hideaway last night was such an experience.   You would never find it if you didn't have the actual street address, there is no sign outside!  Once you are inside it's something else.  A long bar facing the open kitchen was packed with at least a dozen diners.  A handful of tables in front of the bar and in an adjacent room were equally packed at 8:45.  I went inside and found no host, when a pleasant guy who turned out to be host, bartender, server asked us to wait on the sidewalk and handed us a short wine list with very good selections.  Before he could deliver our glasses he told us two seats were open at the bar and we were seated.   

The menu is predominately New Mexican dishes.  My wife had the Santa Fe style pork enchiladas and I had the New Mexico platter with a chile relleno and chicken burro, all with the green chile sauce.  I have to say, we spent a week in Santa Fe a couple of years ago and the food at Dick's was every bit as good as anywhere we ate in Santa Fe.  Their tiny kitchen cranks out some very good food.   The portions were large; I would recommend splitting a salad.  A couple who sat next to us at the bar split the most expensive item on the menu, rack of lamb at $42, and seemed very happy.   

I will definitely plan to visit Dick's again next time we are in Phoenix, fun and good food and wine.
