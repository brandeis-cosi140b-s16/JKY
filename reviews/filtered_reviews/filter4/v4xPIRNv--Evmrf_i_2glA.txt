First time visiting this new restaurant. The decor and service was awesome. I got the fish tacos and they were excellent. The sauce on them had great flavor. The guacamole was not that exciting, it wasn't awful, but was missing some flavor. The beans & rice needed a little more seasoning also, but were decent overall. I'll be back to try more things on the menu.
