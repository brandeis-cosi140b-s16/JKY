I think I was the only person in Vegas who has not part-taken from this hidden local gem.  I've heard all great things from everyone over the years but never had the chance to experience it.  

We met some friends there on Friday night.  The parking was a nightmare.  They had a huge section chained off where I believe alot of their customers usually park.  We ended up parking at the 7/11 and our friends had to park across the street in a vacant lot.  There was a 20 minute wait and there were people everywhere inside and outside waiting.  We decided to get a drink at the bar.  The bar is big however every seat was taken.  There were some 2 seat high tables on the side so we decided to grab one and just order drinks at the bar.

So taking a look around I felt like I took one step into Mexico.  Colorful flags draped the ceilings. The d√©cor is fabulous.  I was already sold one minute into the place. There were a couple large parties which occupied a lot of their tables and a lot of their attention...which is probably reason for everyone waiting in the front.

We were finally seated and immediately served fresh chips, salsa and bean dip.  All of it was fantastic.  The warm bean dip was my favorite.  The BF and I ordered the chicken fajitas to share and the tortillas were fresh and homemade.  It was just enough food for us with all the chips we ate! ;).  

Ambiance - Beautiful authentic Spanish atmosphere!  Service - as quick and attentive as they could be being there was a full house and large parties.  Food - a definite score.  And Parking - a bummer but we lived.  Overall good time had by all!  It wasn't just a meal it was an experience!  Totally whole heartedly recommended!

We will be back soon.
