Cien Agaves was a chill place to have a margarita after work, kick back with the locals and get to know the staff.  The rating is more like a 4.5.   

The tasty seared ahi taco inspired this haiku:

I walk across sand
And find myself sweltering
In need of a drink

The salty rim calls
My dry mouth is quickly quenched
As Richard brings chips

The local spouts off
And teaches new crude phrases
As the staff shakes heads

Margarita three
Thoughts of a supposed friend
prompt melancholy

Then regulars laugh
the seared ahi taco arrives
culinary hug
