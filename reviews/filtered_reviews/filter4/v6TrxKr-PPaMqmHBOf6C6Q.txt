We found this restaurant while walking around the Venetian hotel last week. It was a delightful surprise. It was delicious! I had the beef and chicken fajitas. They were really enjoyable. The only item I missed was cheddar cheese. I never understand why some reataurants don't include cheese with fajitas but they were still great. It came with yummy guacamole and rice and beans. My friend had I think a shrimp burrito. She loved it! It was huge!

I also had a margarita with Grand Marnier. It was one of the best I have ever had. 

Our server was very nice but I had to repeatedly ask for simple things like ice. It was annoying. He also never asked how we were enjoying our meal.

It was a delicious meal and would have loved the chance to go back during my stay at the hotel. Prices were reasonable as well. Definitely recommend it!! I would have given it a 4.5 if I could have....and even higher if service was better.
