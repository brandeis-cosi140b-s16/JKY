Authentic Mexican food.  Sometimes we purchase the bag of tortillas on the way out they're so good.
In two words - Salsa Bar.
Architecturally, not the nicest or cleanest looking place.  Although I'm sure it's clean, just in need of some updating.
Family owned and operated, sometimes the younger staff seems a little on the entitled side if you know what I mean...But what can you expect when their food sells itself and they know it.
