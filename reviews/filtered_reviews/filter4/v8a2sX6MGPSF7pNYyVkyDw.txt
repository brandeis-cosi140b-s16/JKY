Ate here in Sept while searching for the best Mexican food in Madison...the search stopped here, this has to be it!

Ordered takeout and the place was packed. While Sitting in the front waiting for my food, I was able to see the work the cooks put into their food. Everything was fresh and made to order.  We ordered a chicken quesadilla which was outstanding.  Moist fresh chicken with cheese, guacamole, lettuce salad and sour cream. Really was a meal in itself. My wife had chicken tacos which were very good according to her. I went with a beef Chimichanga.  While the flavor of the chimichanga was good, it was fairly greasy. Something of a guilty pleasure really and it is HUGE!  This was accompanied with chips and salsa that weren't bad either. Overall my eyes were bigger than my stomach. Pricing was good I thought for the quality you get. Will be a stop often for me on my drives North. Recommend.
