Googled best Mexican food in Vegas (preferably off strip) and El Dorado kept appearing.  We just happened to be staying close by so thought we would try it out.  Glad I had read the reviews prior to prepare my family about the location.  Same parking lot and building shares wall with a gentleman's club.  But did not feel that effected our experience.  
El Dorado definitely had a Vegas unique Mexican feel to it.  We started with he table side guacamole that was TDF!  So flavorful.  Yummy homemade chips and salsa.  Can definitely get full with that!  We ordered and share the steak/chicken fajitas and the shrimp/chicken enchiladas both with a very tasty green sauce.  The steak was so tasty.  We really enjoyed the food, ambiance of the restaurant and our server. Definitely coming back here when in Vegas!!!!
