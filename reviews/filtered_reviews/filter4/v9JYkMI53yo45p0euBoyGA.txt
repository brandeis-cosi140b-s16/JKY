Hidden gem alert! If you've ever driven on Hayden, traveled north from Thomas and passed by Carlsbad Tavern without stopping in, you're missing out! This is a charming little eatery complete with twinkle lights and a huge moat-like water fountain that surrounds the patio. 

The atmosphere is casual and perfect for large groups. I celebrated a birthday here several years ago and have been for dinner several times. The interior is cozy and feels like you're truly in a cavern and the patio is charming with the sound of water while you eat under the twinkle lights. It's perfect for a casual but ambiance-filled date night, perfect if you have young children and need a place that allows noise and perfect for any sized group. 

The food here is New Mexican and has a serious kick to it (in a good way). It appears that you must ask for salsa upon request. The salsa is very chunky and decent but the tomato chunks can make it hard to dip chips. The nachos are made with chipotle chips which is a nice change-up to typical nachos. Their go-to item is the Green Chile Burrito which is delicious. The combination of red and green sauce adds a kick and adds the perfect amount of "mess" to the meal. Anything here is good and the prices are reasonable so you can enjoy your meal without breaking the bank.
