In my quest for the best Mexican food (somewhere in which the refried beans are not from a can).  I happened upon Mariscos!  It was fabulous and I will return often and work my way through the menu.  I had the camarone culichi, which came with rice, salad and beans.  It was a lot of food, enough to take home for a second meal.  Next time I will try a margarita....it looked very tasty.  The establishment was quaint, it looked very clean and they were very welcoming!
