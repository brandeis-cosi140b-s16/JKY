I like this place.  Think of Gonzalez Y Gonzalez as like an upscale Chevy's, but with better service and higher quality food.  My friend brought me here and I didn't know what to expect.  What I didn't want to order was something traditional like a burrito or enchiladas, I get plenty of that at home.  I ordered the Blue Corn Chicken ($15.95 - maize fed chicken pan seared with cilantro lime potatoes, grilled broccolini, and salsa cruda).  It took me by surprise because it was presented very gourmet like and it was so good!  Finished off the dinner with a Oaxacan Chocolate Cake, not sure if it's still on that menu, but that was really good too.  If you're in NYNY and want something affordable with good portions, give Gonzalez Y Gonzalez a shot!
