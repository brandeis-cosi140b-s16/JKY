The food here is so deliciously creative! We decided to split two things when we went so we could try more. That was a good idea. Try as much food as you can! We had the brûlée burger ... It was amazing. That burnt sugar taste is so delicate and ferocious at the same time. Love the egg .. Loved all of it. We also split the BLT and that was quite tasty. The jalapeño ranch is pretty hot and I asked for it light. I'd probably get it on the side next time. The fries are amazing but the chips aren't quite so good. Also, the carnival corn is so  good .. You have to try that. The mix of spices is delish. Plus, I seem to have a thing for restaurants that serves coke in cans. And they do!
