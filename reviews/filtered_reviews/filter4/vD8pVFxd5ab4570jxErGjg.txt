Mmmm...artichoke and avocado enchiladas are a veggie-saur dream come true! Delicious and then some.

The atmosphere is nice in here, and it's definitely a busy place because of San Tan being such a hot spot for shopping, but the service is really pretty great.

The drinks are somewhat pricey (thus only 4 stars instead of 5), so realistically, this isn't a place you want to come for more than one drink unless you plan to have a large bill at the end of the meal.
