The food here is made fresh and is delicious. The chips were crispy and not oily. I had the vegetarian quesadilla. It was full of flavor and the hot salsa that is made fresh daily was like a blast of various veggies and spices all blending together in sync. I would recommend this place to those looking for fresh Mexican food that is not oily or overloaded with cheese which masks hidden flavors.
