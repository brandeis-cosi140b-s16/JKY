Good food, great drinks. I especially love walking in and seeing/hearing everything rock n roll around the place. The couple of times I've been here there has been very good service and no complaints about the food or anything. In fact, one time I went they were doing a special where you got a free frozen margarita (with Cabo Wabo tequila, the house favorite) with an entree order. This was during the summer, so I'm not sure when it will be back, if at all. I always order the Sopas con Carne (carnitas on corn cakes) and, when I'm feeling fancy, a margarita with Sammy Hagar's own Cabo Wabo tequila.
