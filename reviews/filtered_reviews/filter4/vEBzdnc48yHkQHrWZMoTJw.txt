Thanks you Upward Projects...you make it so hard to go back to work after hanging out at your cool and hip Mexican joint. I feel like I'm on a Mexican vacation when I visit here and all I need is a sombrero and a cabana boy. I love getting away from work and coming back here for lunch. Great decor and amazing patio to enjoy when the weather is perfect. Now let's talk about the tacos... Lots of a great variety to choose from. My favorite are the crispy fish and the braised beef street tacos. Can't go wrong with anything you order here. The salsa also has a great kick to it.
Make it your next lunch stop or hot spot... It will leave you and you belly happy and satisfied.
