Papas con chile (mashed potatoes with cheese and jalapenos) is not what one expects to find on the menu at an average Mexican restaurant.  But Abuelo's is not average - it's way above.  Lovely rooms filled with paintings and murals.  Between the four of us, we tried carnitas street tacos, chili rellenos with meat, chicken quesadilla, carnitas enchilada with red sauce, and spinich enchilada with cream sauce.  Plus papas con chile, refried beans, and whole beans.  All four of us were very satisfied - and full.  The complimentary chips are very light and crispy and come with a typical red salsa and also a hotter green salsa.  The only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is that I want to come back and try their well-known seafood dishes and see what they are like.  They also have a prime rib special on Thursday nights.
