Good tacos if you EVER happen to be on this side of town in Vegas... we were in town to watch SFPD play in a community football league with some other departments of various cities. The park they played at was directly across the street from Pepe's Tacos and we found ourselves here two days in a row after the games to fill up on some awesome tacos. It's a typical taqueria joint with offerings of asada, pollo, carnitas, lengua, etc. Prices ranged from $1.25 a taco to $4 for a burrito. I don't know about the other taquerias in town, but this one was as authentic tasting as I've had in LA and the Mission District in SF. Good stuff!!!
