First, this is not authentic Mexican food.  It is Tex Mex in a pretty authentic setting one might see in Austin or San Antonio.  The Nachos, Guacamole, and Margaritas are as good as you will find anywhere.  The enchiladas are great and the other items are good, too.  This is where locals go, not the place for tourists.  It is reasonably priced, fun, but not tres chic.  The iced tea arrives in red plastic cups, the table is formica and the floor linoleum, all as it should be.
