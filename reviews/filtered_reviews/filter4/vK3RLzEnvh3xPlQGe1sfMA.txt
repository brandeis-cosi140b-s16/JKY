I love almost everything about this place! It's a little stuffy inside so go to the patio if you can. Order a margarita with heat (jalape√±o), you won't be sorry. Their guacamole is incredible and the chips are light and flaky, possibly even fresh. They even have a bacon guac, if you're in to that kind of thing. Pork, chicken, carne and lobster tacos are incredible and made for sharing. Seriously, order the lobster tacos. Do it. You can thank me later.
