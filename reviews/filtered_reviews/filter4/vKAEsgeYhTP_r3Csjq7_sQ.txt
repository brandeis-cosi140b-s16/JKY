Was in this location Saturday night. Oh my god it was a zoo!! So many people, such high energy, everyone was dancing and it seemed like everyone knew everybody. People were polite for the most part except the occasional drunk person but that's expected. Both bars were pretty busy, tables were full, staff was hustling and was friendly. I see bad reviews about this place but I find it hard to believe since this place is packed all the time. This isn't a 5 star steakhouse nor a Las Vegas night club. It's a friendly neighborhood Mexican grill with entertaining nightlife crowd!
