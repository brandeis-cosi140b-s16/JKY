Great food, authentic feel, and attentive service. 

"Do not judge a book by its cover" is what comes to mind when I think about our visit to La Pi√±ata. I really enjoyed our server Jose as he was very upbeat and enthusiastic about the menu. The Guacamole appetizer  is awesome and their chips taste like they are homemade. 

Both my wife and I had great dishes - carnitas and combination fajitas. Both dishes were served with excellent homemade tortillas.  

I recommend this "hole in the wall" Mexican joint. It's guaranteed not to disappoint.
