One would think that finding vegetarian friendly Mexican food would be easy in a major metropolitan.  One would be wrong.

I was  pleasantly surprised that Two Hippies Beach House Outrageous Tacos and Burritos caters to vegetarians, in its very modest selection of items.  The menu only has a handful of items, and that three items were vegetarian friendly was a plus.

I recently ate at this small restaurant and was able to enjoy a bean and cheese burrito.  The pinto beans were free from lard and the rice was free from chicken broth.  The vegetables were organic, which is also a plus.

Inside the burrito, were beans, cheese, rice, cabbage, tomatoes, and onions.  The burrito was quite good.  Salsa was also included on the side, but it was only okay.  Truth be told, the burrito was flavorful enough without the salsa.

The other vegetarian items available were a cheese crisp and bean and cheese tacos.

The prices were quite reasonable.  For two vegetarians, we were able to eat for $14, which included a fantastic slushy lemonade, coke, and side of rice.
