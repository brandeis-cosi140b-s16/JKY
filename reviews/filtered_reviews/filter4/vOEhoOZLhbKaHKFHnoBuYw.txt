One of the best places I ate in Vegas. 
I recommend ordering the guacamole appetizer. It was worth it to watch our waitress make it fresh right in front of us -- plus if you don't like something they can easily leave it out.
I had mushroom fajitas and they were awesome! Strawberry Margarita was not that great. I expected more from a Mexican restaurant. Waitress was very attentive.
