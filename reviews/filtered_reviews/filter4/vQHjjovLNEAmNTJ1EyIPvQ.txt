Te, Te, Te, tequila... Margarita! Holy heaven Cien Agave has the best margaritas in town.  Hottie and I decided to take a seat on the patio during Sunday happy hour to enjoy the Arizona sunshine.  We weren't planning on eating, but after seeing the food being served we decided to give their tacos and some guacamole a try.  I had a veggie taco on a flour tortilla.  It was excellent; they actually grilled up the veggies and the tortilla, giving it the nice crunch of a taco without the frying.  The guacamole was just okay; I've had better and can definitely make a better batch at home.   A good Mexican food restaurant typically has a solid chips and salsa presentation, but their salsa was weak and had gringo written all over it! I'm glad I ended up ordering a taco, because it gave me a better peek into their menu.  We will definitely be back for Happy hour; you can't get a rockin' $3.50 margarita and $2 taco anywhere else in Old Town!
