Well i seen some 1 and 2 stars, don't know what the hell they talking about, but this place rocks. I gave them a 4 star cuz too many people take their kids and cant control them there. LOL. 

But the food is the SHIZZNIT!!!! 

The Chips they bring out are nice crunchy and salt to taste. the salsas and the Lil bean dip uffffff, love it. 

The food is nice and spicy, since I'm Mexican i can handle the heat. 
I always get the Pollo con Queso, can you say DELISIOSO!!! 
My favorite. 

Waiter/es all are kind and helping on ordering. 
If your into Mexican food, its a need to try.
