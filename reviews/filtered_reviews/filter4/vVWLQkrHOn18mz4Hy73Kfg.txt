While taking a visitor to see the Bellagio - and with a 2-year old in tow, we looked for a quick dinner spot that can easily accomodate a toddler.  We turned around from the Bellagio fountains and saw Cabo Wabo and decided to check out the prices.  On a Monday evening around 6pm the place was pretty empty and we sat inside.  The service was excellent and overall we had a very enjoyable dinner experience and I will return to eat here.  Now, the food is a bit overpriced for casual mexican-fare - but this is a Strip-facing restaurant and overpriced food is just normal.  If you live here, you know this well and can't exactly fault the place for it.  If the prices are too much for you, go find a mexican restaurant inside a not-so-popular hotel.  

We started with the fresh guacamole and it was simply wonderful and fantastic and worth the splurge if more than one person will eat it.  I had two margaritas ($12.00 each) - both of which were very good and large.  I ordered the shrimp tacos ($16.00) and each taco had 5-6 wonderfully breaded shrimp.  They were excellent!!   My brother in law had the Mahi Mahi tacos ($16.00) and he LOVED them!!   We also order off the kids menu for our toddler - which is often ridiculous of us because she doesn't eat that much - but we did.  The kids menu is very diverse with many options and the serving side was almost like an adult portion.  What she didn't eat, my brother in law finished off - so it didn't go to waste!  

All in all this was a great dining experience - and great for families with kids.  We will be returning here the next time we need a quick meal near the Bellagio.
