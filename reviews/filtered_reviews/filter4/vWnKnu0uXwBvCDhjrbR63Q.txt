Once again Yelpers you didn't lead me astray.  The food is amazingly fresh and wonderful and plentiful.  I had the shrimp tacos, others had the carne asada tacos, the Del Rey, carnita quesadilla, and the chicken torta.  All loved the food and  the agua frescas were amazing. 

YUMMM....We all died of a food coma for an hour or two after...I will be a regular of this restaurant.
