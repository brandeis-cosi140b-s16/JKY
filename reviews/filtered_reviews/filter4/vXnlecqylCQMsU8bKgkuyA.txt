I live locally and upon hearing everyone who lives downtown say that Tacos El Gordo is the best, authentic, cheap Mexican available in Las Vegas, I dragged my girlfriend and we stopped in one random Thursday night.  The wait time was long (maybe 45+ minutes) and it is almost cafeteria style in the sense that you walk up with your tray and order your tacos and then pay a cashier before you walk out.  Tacos were better than decent & very fresh, but the Carne Asade fries were heavenly.  Totally cheap, very delicious and when I was the only non-Hispanic standing in line....surely a sign of great Mexican food!  I will go back and drag others to experience this little local gem.
