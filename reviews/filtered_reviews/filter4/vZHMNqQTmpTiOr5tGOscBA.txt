Our family has has been coming to Pedro's for three generations. When our kids come into town they always make sure to visit Pedro's at least once. The salsa and chips are great. The shredded beef taco is always a favorite as is the open faced cheese crisp. The service is very fast. I am making myself so hungry for Pedro's that I guess we will go there tonight.
