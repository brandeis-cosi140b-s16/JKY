Like other Yelpers, I found out about this hole-in-the-wall via another Yelper.  I have had it bookmarked for a while!  I haven't gone before today because they only accepted cash!  You guessed it, they accept plastic now.  Whoop.  Awesome.  

I tried the beef tongue, carne asada and chicken tacos.  I thought the tacos were amazing.  I am definitely a food venturing American and I am ashamed to admit that I just love the insides of tacos, but I usually leave the shells.  Either I was super hungry today, or those shells were amazing because, I ate all 3 shells too.  

While the tacos were great, the salsas and pickled veggies were amazing to me.  They have a salsa bar stocked with whole roasted jalape√±os, pickled veggies, and regular, chipotle and green salsa.  The salsa was so yummy that I am pretty sure I ate enough of the regular salsa to have been charged for a bowl of salsa soup.  Just fantastic to me.

One nice thing, this retaurant has expanded and can accommodate small groups for lunch or dinner.  

The parking lot is small.  I saw strange things happening at the businesses mext door and I saw some kids walk in large bowls of what looked like was food for someone, I just hoped it wasnt for serving in the restaurant.  Alas....

My return factor for this place is 100% and it could very well be tomorrow!
