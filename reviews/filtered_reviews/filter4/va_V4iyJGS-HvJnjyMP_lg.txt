Phoenix has so many choices as far as Mexican food goes--one of the better choices is Joyride. 

Well, I wouldn't say it's the best Mexican food in town, but I will say it is worth the trip. The ambience is excellent. I love the teal and burnt orange colors and the retro/modern decor. The restaurant is gorgeous inside and out. There are plenty of large tables for bigger parties, so this makes a great place to bring your friends. 

Drinks are pretty good. I have tried the house margarita, high roller margarita, and the pineapple agua fresca. I will say the house marg is just 'meh'. The other two are tasty. 

I have tried the chicken tinga, carne asada, and braised beef tacos. All three are good, but none blew me away. I would recommend the black beans as a side. They are very tasty!

Overall, this is a great place to drink, munch on chips, and maybe eat a street taco or two. I see it more as a hang out a few hours after dinner or a late night dining option. It's definitely a fun place and I will be going back regularly!
