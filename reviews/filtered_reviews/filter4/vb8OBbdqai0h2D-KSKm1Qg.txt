My wife & I went to Nacho Daddy when it first opened over a year ago.  Back then the food was blah and the service needed a significant overhaul.  We just got back from having dinner there and things have changed.  First of all, they now greet you with a smile and "welcome" when you enter the restaurant.  The waitress, Adryan (based on the receipt), was very attentive and pleasant.  It was happy hour so we ordered house margaritas which were very good.  I've seen in some reviews that the margaritas were too sweet and more like lemonade.  This was not the case.  For an appetizer we had chips and queso.  The cheese was very tasty with just the right amount of spice and the chips were warm.  For dinner my wife had enchiladas.  She liked them very much.  I had the ribeye steak cooked medium which when it arrived it was cooked medium.  It came with grilled corn on the cob and sweet potato fries which were very good.  Total cost for the meal with four margaritas (remember it was happy hour) was below $55.00.  I was pleasantly surprised at the much improved service and quality of the food.  I would recommend this restaurant to friends and family.
