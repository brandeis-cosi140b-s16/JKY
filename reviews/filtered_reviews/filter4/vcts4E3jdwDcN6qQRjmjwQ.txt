3 trips - all for lunch.  Ordered different things every time.  Here's the rundown....

Atmosphere gets 4 stars.  Funky place.  Charlotte needs more character, so this pleases me.  Their parking lot isn't as large as it probably needs to be.  Montford appears to be the new happening street in CLT, so street parking doesn't exist.

Service receives 5 stars.  Knowledgeable,warm, chatty but not too chatty, mixed in some wit into the conversations, fast, accurate, etc.

Food quality/taste/presentation receives 3 stars.  Love the concept. Love Mexican fare.  The tableside guac was killer.  The street corn was killer.  Everything else was just OK.  I went back twice after my first visit wanting it to be better and the food was about the same as the first time around - just ok.  I've had their pork tacos, their short rib torta, and their chicken torta.  The tortas are HUGE, but fairly bland.  Something with the jicama/cilantro/greens mix doesn't work well with the short rib torta.  Same with the chicken torta:  marinated peppers, pickled onions, jicama and cilantro.  Maybe it was the pickled onions?  Maybe I could have tried it with regular onions?  I don't know, but the taste combo just isn't/wasn't working for me.  The tacos were decent, but nothing to go bragging to friends about.  I wish I could bottle the Mexican food truck experience in LA and bring it to Charlotte.  Simple dishes with a ton of flavor.

Overall, I'd score it a 3.5 stars.  The next visit will certainly push me one way or another.  I wish them well.
