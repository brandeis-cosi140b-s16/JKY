Went on a dreary Sunday afternoon with two others. The food was good. One person got a veggie burrito with avocado and portabello, another got a cheese quesadilla, and I got hot "wings" (since there were some drumsticks, too). No real problems except I was told the wrong number of wings (it's 12 oz, not 12 wings).
