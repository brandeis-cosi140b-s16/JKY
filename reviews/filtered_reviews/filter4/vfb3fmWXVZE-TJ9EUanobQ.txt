The restaurant has a nice atmosphere with a southwestern decor. Our server Amy promptly greeted us and showed us to a comfortable table. She followed up several times to ensure all was well. 
The Carne Adovada was a large portion with nice red sauce flavor and the right amount of heat for my taste. The pork was so tender that the pieces of meat fell apart with the touch of the fork. The entree includes a flour tortilla a choice of refried or pinto beans, spanish rice and calabacitas which is a mix of zucchini, corn, tomatoes, bell peppers, and onions. On the side were two sopaipillas.
The menu has many choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Definitely requires a return visit.
