Only giving it 4 stars for now since I have only visited once so I can't attest to the consistency of food quality/portion size/service (all of which were awesome on my first visit today) yet.

Got the no meat salad and Mexican corn as well as the homemade green drink (spinach,  lime, orange). Salad was a nice, large portion for only $5.75 and the veggies were really fresh.

Maybe its cause I'm originally from New York and not used to people around here yet but they were super friendly and service was really great for a fast food environment. We went in not expecting to get a drink but they asked if it was our first time and offered a tasting of a few of their home made drinks which sold us once we tried the green one. As an entrepreneur myself, always gotta give kudos to good marketing! ;)
