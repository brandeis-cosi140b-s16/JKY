You wont find better fish tacos in Charlotte. The BBQ Mahi tacos are great as well as the Tuna with Honey Wasabi Sauce. The atmosphere is cool and the specials are usually really good. Did another reviewer actually complain about the price? This is one of the most reasonably priced fish restaurants in town.
