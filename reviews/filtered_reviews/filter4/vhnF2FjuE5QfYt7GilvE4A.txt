Love this place! The decor is very modern and ambiance is cool and intimate. Good place for a first date! We sat at the bar while waiting for a table. They have a rototating selection of beer on tap. I tried a local seasonal brew from Sedona, AZ. I liked that they offered me a small sample to try out. My gf got a fruity cocktail that she enjoyed. We could see the bartender chop up the fresh fruit to make the juice. Prices for drinks were a little high. I'd come back for happy hour if I was in the area!

For dinner, we tried the chips and guacamole! The chips were awesome! Tasted homemade! The guacamole was the best I've ever had! It had chunks of orange and jalepenos. For entree, my gf ordered the fish and pork tacos. She got the ahi tuna and sea bass. I had the grande carne asada burrito. It was the best burrito I'd ever had, I could barely finish half. It was stuffed with tasty carne asada, avocados, pinto beans and salsa and grilled to perfection! 

I always want to come back when I'm in the area!
