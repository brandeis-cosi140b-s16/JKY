I absolutely love coming here. I am a vegetarian and I crave for their tofu tacos. My faves are Tofu Nuez and sometimes I cheat and have some Shrimp or FIsh tacos which are also awesome. The Tofu Tacos have these interesting pasty, and spicy, sauces and I always leave the place totally full! For sides I get either the salad, sweet potato fries, the banana thingy..., or quinoa. What a healthy meal! 

I always get the "rebels" special for being a student from UNLV but to be honest one of those plates (which includes four tacos and two sides) are plenty for two unless you're starving that day! But i must note that for vegetarians, the tofu tacos cost extra.. but still worth the money in my opinion. 

The place looks kind of empty and most of my friends (who are not vegetarian at all) have never been there, but once i make them try their food they always leave happy. 

The only thing about this place that stops me from giving 5 stars is that sometimes the service isn't consistent and I do not enjoy the random bands that play there from time to time. But I must say I am very picky and the fact that they support upcoming artists are nice. Just not my cup of tea to be listining to screaming hard metal while i eat my tacos. :) 

All in all, its a definite place to stop by and try their billion choices of tacos!!
