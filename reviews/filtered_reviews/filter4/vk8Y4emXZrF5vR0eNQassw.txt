Took my husband here last weekend ( he hasn't been to Vegas since 2006). 
We both LOVE the frozen lime margs and be careful of on the rocks style (POTENT)!

It was busy about 1230 in the afternoon...but we got seated quickly outside and order drinks right away...we had to ask 20 minutes for chips and salsa. Other than that we both had the Cobb with Chicken.  Large salads with fresh tasting veggie, generous meat and very moist!  WE loved it.

Try to get outside -its great people watching for sure!

We will go back in Sept for our anniversay and it's the first place we plan on hitting once we check in to our hotel!
