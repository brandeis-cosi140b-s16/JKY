First time here.  Had the carne Asada taco and the carnita taco.  Both were very good.  I have had better of each as well.  Ordered the cilantro lime rice and the charro beans for sides.  The rice was fabulous.  The charro beans were good, but again, I have had better.   I had the guacamole with chips to start.  Have only had comparable guac at Frontera.  It was the best part of my meal!
