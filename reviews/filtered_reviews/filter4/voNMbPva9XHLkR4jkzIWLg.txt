This location is the best one we have found.  I agree with the post about the gas station locations.  The worst Roberto's we found was at a gas station, but  this location has a nice decor and has always been very clean.  The staff has been all hispanic, who better to make more authentic Mexican dishes?  A plus there.  And they have always been very nice and efficient

The food is a great value.  Big portions for a small price.  While we have liked a lot of things and go often, there have been some dishes that were not the best.  The nachos were a big dissapointment, very very greasy.  So they lose a star for a few bad dishes.  But their flour tortillas are the BEST!  They are HUGE!  I could make a meal out of those and refried beans only.

Clean, good food and unbeatable prices.
