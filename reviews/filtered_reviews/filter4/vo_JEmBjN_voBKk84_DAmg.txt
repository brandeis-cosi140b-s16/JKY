This restaurant is usually busy, and it's definitely for a reason! The taco salad is amazing- I usually get that or 3 tacos. My favorite meat is the shredded chicken, and their creamy dressing is the best! It's slightly spicy, and completely delicious! They've messed up my order once, but when I came back, they gave me the missing item for free. I have tried the sweet pork barbacoa- it is sweet, so if you don't like sweet BBQ sauce, avoid it. A lot of my friends really like it though... The food is very fresh, and really good!
