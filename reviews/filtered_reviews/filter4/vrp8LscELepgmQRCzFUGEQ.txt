I've been here several times, mostly with coworkers on our lunch break. Chips and salsa are really good. Today I had the carnitas lunch special and had them sub corn tortillas for flour, with no problem, and it was really tasty. Another coworker got the fajitas which she really enjoyed. Our server today was John and he was on the ball!
