I dined at Verde after a Yelp event today. I must admit that without the preceding Yelp event, I would've given this restaurant a 3 star review. However, the event made the drink menu truly come alive, and I would definitely come back to just hang out at the bar.

My husband, friend, and I snagged a table after the event. We were told by the hostess that the table would be needed at 7:30. Since it was only 5:30, we reassured her that we would definitely have left by then. Our waitress was polite, and the food arrived promptly. However, though the service was solid, it wasn't necessarily amazing.

We started with the chips and green tomatillo salsa. This appetizer is a great, inexpensive way to start off your meal. The portion size is petite but enough for the amount paid and for all of us. We decided to order the large family style tacos to share, which ended up being the perfect amount of food for three. We selected the Pescado, Carnitas, and Barbacoa with corn tortillas. The tortillas were very tasty, but the taco fillings left a little bit to be desired. They just needed more flavor! I am not a spicy food fan - I order my Thai food at a 2 or 3 spice level - but could've used more spice here. My favorite taco was the Barbacoa as the jalapeno feta packed a tasty punch.

Though I do think Verde is overpriced ($39 for 9 tacos?), I would be willing to check it out again. Plus, the owner mentioned that Verde will be doing roasts (with pineapple!) on the patio this summer... Sign me up!! I will be there with a group of friends!
