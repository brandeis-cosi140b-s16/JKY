Distrito has great food! The fish tacos are to die for, I can't order anything else when I go. They also have great drinks, and a really cool atmosphere! However, I do think this place is a little pricey for what it is, and we've had bad experiences with the service. Yet, I still continue to come back because those fish tacos are so good. Tip: they are on Local Dines so you can get 50% off, also check in to yelp for free guacamole!
