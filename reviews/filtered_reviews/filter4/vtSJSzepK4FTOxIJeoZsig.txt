Great place to come with friends.  CHEAP happy hour specials such as the giant Nachos, yum :)  Enormous servings, I'm not kidding.  The guacamole appetizer is giant as well, so be careful you bring other people with you or else you will end up wasting yo foods.   

Come in, try something different each time you visit and find what you like!  I like the guac, nachos, and tostadas, delicious!
