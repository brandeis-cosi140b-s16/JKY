So me and my buddy hit this spot up on a Saturday night. It has a nice feel to it, good music playing, nice lighting, tv's with sports on. The staff is friendly enough, and the food came quickly and was deliciously hot and melty. They start you off with chips and salsa which is actually 4 separate dipping sauces including beans. My only complaint is I ordered the chimichanga plate enchilada style and was expecting a larger meal. Tasted good but a little small. I think I just ordered the wrong thing. My buddy got the green chili platter and was huge and looked awesome.  Then they top it off with fresh hot sopappias (get them covered in cinnamon. ...trust me lol). Plan on going back for a combo plate or the green chili burro looked great.  Happy hogging lol
