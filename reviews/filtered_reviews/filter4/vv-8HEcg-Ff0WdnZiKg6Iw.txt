I loved the cozy outdoor patio space at the Cantina. It's really a gem in such a built-up, urban area like Lawrenceville. Also the chips, salsa, and guacamole were all delicious. I was there for an event so I didn't get to order from the menu, but there were a few samplings of their tacos and from what I tasted, I'd definitely come back for more. The majority of their seating space seems to be outside on the patio, so seating must be pretty limited in the colder months. Either way, I can't wait to go back to try some more of the menu.
