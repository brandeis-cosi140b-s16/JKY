Been to the Spotted Donkey in Carefree multiple times and always been happy.  (can't speak to their new location on Hayden as we haven't been there yet).  The drinks are very good, if a bit pricy and the apps are wonderful.  Ordered the short stack of nachos, stuffed peppers and enchaladas this time.  All very good and tasty.  One note, everything seemed to be a bit "saucier" this time, especially the nachos.  While the sauce is very good and tasty with a good amount of spice, it was a bit mcuh for me.  I don't remember it being that way before so perhaps this was a fluke.

Will definately be back
