This review is based on the 'Straight Up Flight' I had at Tex Tubb's.  We had already had a great meal at Eldorado Grill but the bar was really full when we were done so we headed to Tex Tubb's for a drink.  I tried the Straight Up Flight at the bar there...I got to try the Palace, Mezcal, and Prickly Pear Margarita.  I have to say - I love a good sampler.  It's so hard to make a choice when there are so many new things you've never had.  The Palace and Mezcal were fine - the Prickly Pear was wonderful!  Now I know what to order next time.  Atmosphere and service was also great!
