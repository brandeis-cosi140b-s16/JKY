I really enjoyed Hussong's for lunch. Good tex-mex, similar to what you'd find in the Southwest where they actually do tex-mex well. Anyway, it's a yummy place to stop for chips, guac, and margs while shopping at Mandalay Bay.

The restaurant did not have a lot of frills, rather basic decor, but the food is very good. I had chips and guacamole to start, and the chips were perfectly crispy without being greasy. The guacamole was fresh, and well-balanced with heat and acid. I had the fish baja tacos, and they were very good as well. I loved the avocado salsa.

My friend and I also ordered a pitcher of the original margarita. It was fantastic. No sour mix!! Just tequila (and a lot of it), agave, and freshly squeezed lime juice. These margaritas are very drinkable, but be forewarned, they do pack a punch. I went back to my hotel room after lunch and proceeded to take a nice long nap.

I highly recommend Hussong's as a fun place to stop for lunch if you're in the mood for good tex-mex.
