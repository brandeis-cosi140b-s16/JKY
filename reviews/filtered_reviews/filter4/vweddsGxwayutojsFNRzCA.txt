Came to Vegas and a friend showed me this place. First time here and love the food. The only thing keeping me from giving a 5 star review would be the service. This is a small hole in the wall looking joint with amazing fusion food but the service disappointed me. The waitress was so aggressively in a hurry I simply just said ok to anything she said and she moved on. I understand the place is small with a lot of traffic and she does move fast, however, she rushed my table when ordering and no one appreciated that. Other than that this place is great.
