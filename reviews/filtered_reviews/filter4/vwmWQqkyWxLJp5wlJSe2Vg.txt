A Chexican -- just like me!

From the outside, this place looks a little tacky, but the food is great... I would say the Mexican food is a little better than the Chinese food, but either way, you can't really go wrong, and some of the fusion dishes aren't too bad either. The agua frescas are pretty legit, and the service was really nice. The presentation is pretty hip and unique, just like the Cosmopolitan itself. 

My family and I came here after waiting eleventy thousand years for some other restaurant upstairs that had fish that was supposed to look appetizing... We were more than impressed with this place. Thank you, China Poblano! You make me feel like I'm at home.
