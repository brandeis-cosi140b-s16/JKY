I was at the La Quinta Hotel and was goign to the Subshop and decided to go to this little "hole in the wall" in a strip mall and for except for the little sign outside the door you could miss the place. I came in and noone was there and I thought that was a bad sign. However I order the Barbacoa combo plate and I was very surprise at what I got. I must say that I was a little disapointed in the amount of food your recieve for the price.  I paid $12 for the plate and when I say it , I said to myself "what the hell where is my 12 bucks worth of food". I must say the food is very good, but they do not give you a lot of rice, or beans, which you think that they would .

This is not your normal Mexican food, you can tell that there has been some thought to it. Just as a note , some of the extra's will cost you so just be aware.

Bottomline, Good food , not in the regular mexican fare group

Con; No enough on your plate for the the price you get even if it is a gourmet
