I ate here for lunch last Friday with my wife and my mom.  It's located inside the Aria hotel.  This place is what I would consider upscale mexican food.  The decor is very cool, and they even have what they call a "tequilla tree" near where we sat.  We had a nice, big, and comfortable booth to sit in.  First off, I want to say that the service here was absolutely fantastic.  Our server, whose name escapes me, took great care of us throughout our meal.  I had never had mole sauce, and he brought us all some to try before we ordered.  I was immediately sold on it and ordered the chicken enchiladas with mole sauce.  My wife ordered chicken tacos while my mom ordered the beef tacos.  It was a simple, yet very good lunch.  They give you chips and salsa when you sit down, so be careful not to fill up on those, as it's very good.  Everything here is very fresh and home made.  Our server even gave us a complimentary fried ice cream for dessert.  I will most definitely come back here again.
