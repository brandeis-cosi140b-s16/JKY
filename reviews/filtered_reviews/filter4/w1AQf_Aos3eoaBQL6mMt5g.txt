We were torn on coming here because of the reviews but it worked out, I would recommend it, especially if you're staying at the Boulders Resort (they will drive you there on a golf car). I'm guessing they might have read the reviews and addressed the problems.

Our service was great (went there 3 days over a 6 day visit). The food was a little overpriced (it's part of the Waldorf Asotria, so I kind of expected that, but charged it back to my room to get the HHonors points).

While it wasn't the best Mexican food I've ever had, it was tasty and good.

The atmosphere is casual and friendly.
