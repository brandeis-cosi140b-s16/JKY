According to the reviews of this place, we were expecting greatness.  Is that what we got?  Not quite, but it was good.  I would highly recommend anything with beans in it.  The beans are by far some of the best I have ever had.  I am a bean connoisseur and believe that beans are one of the "perfect foods" so that means a great deal.  The fish tacos were also outstanding.  I loved the creamy sauce mixed with pico on top of the crispy huge chunks of fish.  The chckien on the chicken taco and the beef in the beef quesadilla were both way overvcooked and tough.  The meat in the tacos al pastor was also overcooked and lacked flavor.
