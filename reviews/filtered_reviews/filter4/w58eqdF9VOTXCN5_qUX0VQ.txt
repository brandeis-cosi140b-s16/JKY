Some like it hot. If you're one of those people, you'll like this place. The food is tasty and some of this dishes have a nice kick to it. 

I probably come here about 5 times a year when I'm going out to eat with my family. Good place to feed and seat 6-8 people groups. The service is usually descent and the prices aren't too bad.
