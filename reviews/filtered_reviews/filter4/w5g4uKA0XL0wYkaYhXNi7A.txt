Unpretentious Mexican restaurant with good food (and lots of it--portions are huge) and quick but friendly service. My go-to order at Mexican restaurants is fajitas, and I really love the marinade they use at Azteca. The tableside guac is delightful and the margaritas are BIG. Skip the Mexican joints in the trendier parts of town and give Azteca a try.
