The seating outside is lovely.  It is so rare to find a pretty secluded place to sit outside in main Charlotte area.   This venue is very charming and although the restaurant sits in The Villa on Providence which is a busy road, the outdoor seating is on the back side lending itself to a serene feel.  Neighbors know to enter (walking or driving) off Fenton as parking out front can be challenging at times.  I've been there 3 times and enjoyed ordering a different item every time.   The menu is fun and the food is good.   The spirits from the bar aren't the only ones flowing - apparently the staff doesn't like to work past closing as some mysterious things have happened.   It is a beautiful home with lots of history and they'll tell you all about it if they aren't too busy.  I'm giving the food 3 1/2 stars and the bar a 5.   I'm glad Eastover finally has a good neighborhood haunt, if you'll pardon the pun.
