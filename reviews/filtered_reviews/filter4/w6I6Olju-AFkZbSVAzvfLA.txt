Met some friends here for happy hour and fundraiser. Prices were good & we had great service the whole time we were there. Started out sitting on the patio on a semi-chilly night. The lit up the heaters for us, as soon as they saw us getting cold, and without us asking. It got really windy, so we asked our waitress if we could move inside. She was very helpful and got us a table right away, no attitude about closing out our bills, at all. 

The setting both indoors & out is very casual. Love the big open booths with the cushy seating...more like comfy conversation areas. I've heard they take some of the tables out & have dancing there later. We left early, but will have to come back to see what that's all about next time!
