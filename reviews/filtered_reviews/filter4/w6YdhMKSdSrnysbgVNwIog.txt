i stayed at Mandalay Bay recently and a hotel employee recommended this place for a casual lunch/dinner. I wasn't expecting much and nothing on the menu caught my eye..

Little did I know how AMAZING the fish tacos are! WOW. Beer-battered mahi mahi with huge chunks of avocado in a delicious creamy sauce.

I also tried the open-faced quesadilla which was pretty tasty, but I would recommend sharing it as the strong flavor gets to be too much.

Since Hussong's last month, I crave fish tacos ALL the time!
