Don't let the outside, which looks like fast food joint, fool you. Though you do order at the counter, it otherwise is more like a restaurant experience. The decor is very nicely done and the food is restaurant quality. Many options on the salsa bar. 
My only minor complaint is that you have to pay for chips and salsa. Since the prices and food quality are not "fast food" it seems like the chips should come with the meal. 
The service was super friendly.
