I happened to be in the area and have been wanting to try it for a while.  I got the El Pastor plate.  It was good, but unfortunately I've nothing else to compare it, because at any of the *Berto's places I usually order Machaca.  I will admit I got it because they featured it on Diner's Drive-ins & Dives, and it did have a real, cook-to-order grill taste (wok-mei if you will) which I very much enjoyed especially with a fresh tortilla, but again I have no prior El Pastor experience.  The salsa was just ok IMO.

I'd like to try something with green chili sauce next which was also featured on the aforementioned TV show.  Oh, their horchata was really good, yes I know they just dump the stuff into the mixer but it was one of the better ones I've had.  

At worst you'll have a belly full of decent Mexican food, so try it.
