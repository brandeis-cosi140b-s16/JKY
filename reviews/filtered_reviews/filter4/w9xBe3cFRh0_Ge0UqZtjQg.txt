The $60 lunch price tag was a little scary but when in Vegas...

The eats here are delicious.  Bottomless chips?  Sign me up.  The guac is also absolutely amazing, a meal in itself.  Prickly Pear Margarita?  Excellent.  Veggie tacos?  Awesome.  Basically the food itself is incredible but the prices are killer.  We probably could have gone without the guac but it was presented in this manner..."Would like like some bottomless chips and guacamole?"  Bottomless chips for $3 is one thing but $10 guac is something completely different.

Loved the ambiance and the outdoor patio.  The patio is nicely shaded from the hot Vegas sun and allows you to stare at passersby on the strip.  Service is pleasant and efficient.

I would eat here again but think twice on the appetizers and mixed beverages, which seem a little pricey.
