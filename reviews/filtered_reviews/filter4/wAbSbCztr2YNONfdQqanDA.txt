Great place for some tacos! Expect long lines! 

I will say that you have to inconveniently order certain items on separate lines... Which takes longer to get your food. :/

Also, pay after you get the food, but before you sit down. The cashiers will stare at you. Oops, we were first timers and didnt know their protocols.
