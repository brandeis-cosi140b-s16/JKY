Aunt Chilada's has it's charm. The front patio (on Dreamy Draw) is filled with mature trees, fountains & vegetation. It's really a perfect atmosphere to pretend you're in the Yucatan swilling Tequila in the jungle if  you like that sort of thing...

They have these fantastic flour chips & salsa that come with your drink- I can eat a whole basket of them before the main course arrives. I always get the taco's and they're consistently good, not great. They make strong margarita's. They have a chocolate fountain on Sundays too.

Oh yeah, this is another place you can bring your dog onto the patio.

BOTTOM LINE:  Great neighborhood Mexican, one of AZ's best patios!
