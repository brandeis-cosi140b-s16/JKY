Our first time there, so we had 3 different tacos and a shrimp-burrito.  Very fresh and flavorful.  Burrito was surprisingly good, and so was the fish taco and blackened chicken.  We also tried the flan -- this was the best surprise.  Was great!  I don't think you can find anything that will top this place as far as a casual Mexican food joint in Scottsdale. We'll definitely be back.
