The food is absolutely incredible, I have yet to try something on the menu I do not like. HOWEVER I must warn everyone to SAVE YOUR RECEIPT because my credit card was up charged after a recent visit. I called  SumoMaya and they took down my number and then had someone from the management company call me. I was unable to answer when she called (on Friday) so she said she would call me on Monday. I never received another call. I was only charged $5 more than I should've been so I wasn't going to waste time out of my day over 5 bucks. The only reason I called in the first place was because of principle. The server had added and additional $5 to her tip after I had already left her over 20%. I do not appreciate the dishonesty of the server but will be a returning customer due to the outstanding food.
