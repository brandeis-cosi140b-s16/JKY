We tried Coyote's per fellow Yelpers.
I liked it. I ordered a "Cheese Enchilada" and it was the biggest Enchilada I have ever gotten!
The Rice was OK but not great and the Beans were tasty.
The Chips and Salsa were very good.
It was $9.99 for my meal which I found fair.
We didn't have to wait long for a table and the service was great.
We will try this place again when on that side of town.
