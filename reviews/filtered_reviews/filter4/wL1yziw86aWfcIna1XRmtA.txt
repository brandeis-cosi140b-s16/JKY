I was pretty surprised that I would even want to eat at a $$ possibly $$$ Mexican restaurant since you can get $ burritos and tacos that are beyond authentic here in the Bay Area. 

I made reservations for 8 at 7:30; arrived late and were still promptly seated on a busy Friday night at prime dinner hour. The service was attentive and cordial, the food was delicious (hello Chicken and Seafood enchiladas, pork tacos and chicken fajitas!) and the price was reasonable compared to the normal Vegas tax that you would pay for premium food around here. 

Their margaritas were also especially notable, the fruit muddle is good but the MOJITO is just out of this world! ... and I don't even like mojitos! 

Overall, $35/person for entree, one appetizer (shared amongst 8) and a drink. Not too bad for a nice place in Vegas that has a nice vibe.

WARNING: don't order the guac, you'll regret it for $9 with what little they give you and how it's just okay.

OH and they don't tell you this but they only give you 2 tortillas with your fajitas (even though it probably requires 4) and they charge you $4 for additional tortillas!
