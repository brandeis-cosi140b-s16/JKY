Fantastic food.  Valentines day.  Reserved table, and it was ready on the spot.  Only complaint - extra tables were brought in to increase seating.  All good - except - our table was in what was normally a walk way.  It felt like grand central station.  Also, the temporary table was so small - it had barely enough room for our dinner plates and silver... add a drink, glass of water, condiments, appetizer, salad, etc - it became a challenge to juggle the table without spilling anything.  Ordered the Spinach Chorizo Dip - fantastic flavor - fresh - but the spinach leaves were left whole - and by the time it cooks - there's long strings of green that makes it impossible to dip and scoop ... using the fork helps - but you have a pile of green to load onto a chip... please chop the spinach - it would be tons easier to eat!!  The Chimayo Chicken and the New Mexican enchiladas were fantastic - but the house salad as so-so ...may have been due to the volume of meals that night - but nothing special.  Overall - a great meal.
