Was not expecting much from an airport restaurant ... boy was I surprised. Loved the carnitas burrito (enchilada style). Very generous portions, yummy, and about what I'd expect to pay at any other Mexican restaurant.  We topped off the meal with the flan, which was some of the best we can remember.

Next time we have a layover in PHX, this is where we'll be!
