I apologize for not writing this one soon after I ate there. We had read the reviews and everyone seemed to really like the food.
This place is not fancy by any means. Very plain but the food.... The offerings on the menu was different from any mexican food place I have been to. Many offerings I have never seen before. My suggestion is go there and experience the food. I have eaten mexican food all over the west from Texas to California and all states between. This was  the best I have had. I loved the menu selections. Not just burritos, tacos, tostadas or a combination of these three. A completely new offerings of items and everything looked good. First go to their website then go. It was hard for me to rate this restaurant. The food was positively a 5. The service was a 4. Not bad service, just not as good as it gets. The store was a 4. Nothing bad just not a 5. So I gave the place a 4. If I could give a 4.5. 

Go there. Eat! Enjoy. I loved the new food choices. Definitely going back.
