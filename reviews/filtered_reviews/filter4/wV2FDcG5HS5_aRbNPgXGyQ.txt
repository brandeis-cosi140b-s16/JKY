I came here to Phoenix on a business trip.  My clients told me about a place that is a combination of chinese and mexican and I initially did not think the two went together.  

But man, this place is amazing.  I order the chicken and rice with the spicy sauce.  It blew my mind away.  The plates kinda reminded me of when I went to Halal carts in NY. 

Easing to find parking, order came out quickly, and place had plenty of seats.

This is my first time going or even hearing about a Chinese-Mexican.  Still blows my mind away.  lol
