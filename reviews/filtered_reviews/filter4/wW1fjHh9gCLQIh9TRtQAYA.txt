I had a great meal here again! I started off with their Crema de Elote soup which is a delicious corn chowder topped with spice-rubbed shrimp. It was sweet, salty, warm with little pieces of corn which gave it a nice texture. It was a delicious, perfect soup!

I also got their famous Chile en Nogada. It's a roasted large green chile pepper stuffed with pieces of chicken and dried fruit in this red sauce, topped with a delicious, creamy almond sauce. All the flavors were perfect together, I especially liked the creamy almond sauce. Definitely unique and delicious!

I couldn't finish the horchata, served in a Coke bottle, so got that to go. All in all a delicious meal. Several tables around me got multiple orders of their tacos so that seems pretty popular. Glad I came back again!

Also, they have a location at the airport, I was flying Southwest so if you can't eat here for some reason, you can at least grab the same food at the airport!
