Had a fun time here! Taco salad was great with shrimp. Parking easy, music dance-inspiring and food plentiful! Also, thank you Sabor for the open faced trash cans. People like myself appreciate not having to hold a trash can open while simultaneously dumping trash and trying to avoid getting it everywhere! ;) Can't wait to go back.
