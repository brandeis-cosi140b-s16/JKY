Came here last weekend after the Mat Franco show.  Were seated immediately by the bull riding station.

Our waitress, Adriana came by quickly and took our drink orders.  She was helpful and welcoming!  She made our dining experience super enjoyable with her professionalism and warmth.  I wish more waiters and waitresses had her behavior!

We ordered...
Guacamole - a bit bland (would be better with some lime juice)
Steak Taco - Delicious!
Corn Enchilada - My husband loved it!
Red Sangria - Delicious!
Corona 

Aside from girls dressed in bikinis riding bulls and the guy on his joystick jerking them for his and other men's sexual pleasure, the rest of the restaurant was pretty cool.  I loved the day of the dead d√©cor on the walls, the crosses and chandeliers with bottle bulbs.
