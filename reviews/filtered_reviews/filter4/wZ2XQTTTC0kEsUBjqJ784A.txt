I am a fan of this place. I am sorry, but El Jeffe Nachos- $16.00 that feeds up to 6 people, are the biggest and most loaded and cheapest nachos I have ever seen or ate. And, they are good. Not to mention they are open until 6 AM and, not to mention that they have $2 Margs, $2, Shots and a Loaded Mexican Menu. Seriously, if you ain't a fan, I don't know what to tell you. Service could be better, but who cares.
