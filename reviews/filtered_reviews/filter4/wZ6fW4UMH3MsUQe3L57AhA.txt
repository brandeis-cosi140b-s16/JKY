New times said this place had some good menudo, I came by to see for myself.  I must say it didn't disappoint.  I tried the Red while my girlfriend had the white and they both tasted pretty damn good.  Aside from that I had a taco and enchilada combo too and that was pretty decent.  The ground beef in the taco was mixed with potato which gave it an interesting consistency, good yes but different.  
I'd definitely come back and try the rest of the menu and maybe one of them supersize margaritas I see around flowing around me.  

My only negative review I would say is they should definitely have the toilets checked out, I didn't lay anything major but it didn't wanna flush. Also the water tasted like it was freshly from Mexico, maybe it boosted the food a bit but it didn't quench my thirst.
