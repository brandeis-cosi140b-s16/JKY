Sandbar was by far my favorite place I ate at, on my quick weekend trip in Arizona.  I decided to get  the Ahi Tuna tacos.  The taco shell was actually a Jicama based shell.  It was healthy but delicious! From the environment, to the chips and salsa (amazing) to the food everything was a great surprise! I'm going back!    (However, the noise level is too loud where it's difficult to understand what the person sitting next to you is even saying.)
