Oh Mary Lou how I love you!

I still don't know how this dish came to be called the Mary Lou, but I don't care what it is called...it is sooo good!  A cheese quesadilla covered in a delicious green beef chile sauce....it is so indulgent, but it is worth it!  They sure don't skimp on the cheese here and the beef in the chile is so tender it just melts in your mouth.  Add on a side of their delicious beans and you have yourself a tasty meal.  Be prepared to share (or just have lots of leftovers) cause this thing is huge!  The best part is during happy hour you can get it for half price!

The tacos, enchiladas and beans are also top notch here.  I would also have to say the plain old cheese crisp is one of the best ones out there, always crispy and not skimpy on the cheese!

I just wish they had a parking space for take-out orders!
