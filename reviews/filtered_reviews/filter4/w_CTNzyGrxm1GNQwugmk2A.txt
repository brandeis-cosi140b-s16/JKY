We came expecting a slightly more formal restaurant, but this casual set up worked for us too. They have a bar area that had more patrons at it then were sitting at the tables for food. 

They did not have to twist our arm to get us to try their margarita drink special. The margaritas were pretty average but they were cheap so that is a win in my book!  The drinks worked well with the basket of chips and 3 salsas which were delivered to the table. One of the salsas was ridiculously mild, but the green and hotter red (habanero) were tasty. Our server did a great job keeping us topped off with the two salsas that we liked. 

We ordered the lobster enchiladas and the parilladas. The lobster enchilada was not overflowing with lobster but there was enough there to let it be known that it was  present. This was my first time having parilladas, which is essentially a mixed meat fajita with pan fries thrown in for good measure. Not a huge fan of the potato addition so I will opt for straight up fajitas in the future. 

Definitely a great choice for good food in an elevated fast food setting.
