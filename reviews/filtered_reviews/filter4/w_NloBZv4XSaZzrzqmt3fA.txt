Went for happy hour recently with friends, we had a table of 6, our server was awesome and very attentive. We didn't want for anything and pretty much kept her on her toes all evening but she rose to the occasion. I had a Chambord Margarita. Actually there was more than one. We had several appetizers, including the tableside guacamole. While it was good, I have never had cotilla cheese on my guac before, so I think I would leave that off in the future. We also had the Green Chile Pork nachos and we all enjoyed those. The queso was tasty but I later realized it likely had flour in it (as a thickening agent) so my bad for not asking about that in advance (I'm gluten intolerant). A friend who is also GF got the Street Tacos and enjoyed them. And another friend got the Flat Top Grilled Quesadillas and she really liked them too. We'll be back!
