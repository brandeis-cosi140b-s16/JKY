Talk about some delicious and not-so-expensive food on the strip! Had a great time seated in the patio area....excellent chips and salsa...yes, you have to pay $2.95 for them, but it's enough to feed several people and they are bottomless. 

My veggie tacos were delish! Fresh grilled veggies, cilantro lime rice, black beans, and some tasty homemade corn tortillas. The staff is super friendly and all of the food is fresh. The fresh made guacamole is a must try as well!

My brother's carne asada tacos looked great as well. It was certainly plenty of food and for 2 meals, 2 drinks, chips and salsa it was around $45. Not terrible! Would certainly recommend this place!
