One does not go to Carolina's for ambience, decor, or service necessarily. One goes for amazingly delicious and authentic Mexican food-that's it. It's a dive establishment with hard chairs and bare walls that makes you feel like you're eating in some warehouse basement. The menu is pretty basic and it's a little confusing to figure out what items are vegetarian. Heads up, there aren't many. Even the guy taking our order was kind of confused. I could see it in his eyes (you don't eat meat?). 
We ordered the cheese enchiladas with green chile sauce, the green chile and cheese tamales and a dozen tortillas to take home. Those tamales were kick ass-only way to describe them. Of course we opened the tortillas and started eating them with our enchiladas. Still warm and soft they are far better than tortilla factory which I used to think was pretty good. I used the rest of the tortillas we had purchased to make veggie burritos at home. I would come back for those tortillas alone!
