We walked over from the Boulders Resort at the end of happy hour - which is 3-6. They have good mojitos here! They didn't have a lot of vegetarian options on the menu but they gladly made me something off menu- bean & rice burro. My husband had a burger & he said it was excellent. 

The biggest wow was the flan. Not all flan is good & it's easy to screw up, but theirs was excellent! 

The reason i dropped a star is because it was overpriced & the food came out piecemeal. 

If i am in the area i will be back for happy hour!
