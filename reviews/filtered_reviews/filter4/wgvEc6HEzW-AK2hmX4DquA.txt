I'm not sure if I love this place or if I just love cheesy Mexican and drinks with tequila... but I'm going with I love this place.

Best thing hands down on the menu are the chorizo tacos.  They are in the back of the menu marked "grilled tacos" and you will most likely miss it.  Don't.  And get these.  They are spicy and simple (two corn taco shells - authentic and soft - for each of the three tacos you get filled simply with their spicy and yummy chorizo).  They give you two sauces and a fresh lime to jazz them up.

Friends got the fajitas and seemed to really like them and I would also recommend the Queso Fundito and Chicken Nachos for group munching.

If you leave here hungry and completely sober, you have not done your job properly.

PS - Nothing screams authenticity like misspellings on an "ethnic" menu.  CHARMING.

PPS - When I found out this was a chain - local, but still a chain - I cried a little inside.  I stick to the Southside location and try to forget there's one on McNightmare.  Makes me feel better.
