Oh my ghost chili salsa!!!!!    How did I ever live without it?!  It's changed my salsa life forever.  It's super spicy and has tons of fresh garlic in it.  The result is 3 glasses of water and a perma-grin wearing, fire breathing happy girl. 

We also ordered the guacamole and it was equally great. I find most guacamole at restaurants to be sub par and this was outstanding. The beans were great and the rice was fantastic too. Next time I'll have to dine in instead of getting take out so my enchiladas won't be soggy.

Overall, I'm a fan!  The last time I was this happy with a Mexican restaurant I was living in LA.
