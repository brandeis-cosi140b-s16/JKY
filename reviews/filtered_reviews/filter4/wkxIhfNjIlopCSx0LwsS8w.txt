Great happy hour and dinner items! Here are my faves:

[Good items]
Guacamole (but the chips suck so garnish on tacos)
Chicken & Steak tacos 
Chilean sea bass entree (healthy, flavors are subtle with hints of spice from the jalepano, and acidity from the lime, soft texture)
Filet mignon chille relleno (my favorite item, the smoked chile sauce does wonders, and I like how they cut up the meat for you so that all you have to do is fork to mouth)
Sweet corn tamale (definitely get a side of this with your dish!)
Sea scallops
Sangria & Margarita (it's good esp during happy hour prices)

[Meh items]
Ahi tuna tostada (sliver of chopped up tuna on fried tortilla basically, flavors were tad boring)

[Bah items]
Rock shrimp tacos (shrimpy shrimp excessively covered in batter)
Mundo fries (no bueno, super dull fries)
The free salsa & chips (probably worst item, but hey it's free!)

Note: During happy hour you have to sit at the bar to get the happy hour deal. But, we talked to the staff and they were nice enough to accommodate our group who wanted both happy hour and dinner items. How cool is that!
