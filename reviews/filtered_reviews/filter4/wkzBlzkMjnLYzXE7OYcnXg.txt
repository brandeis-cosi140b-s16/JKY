I was pleasantly surprised by the great service and taste of the food.  I had an amazing waiter and the manager was even walking around asking how everyone's meals came out.  

I loved the chips and salsa.  There was a mix of different colored chips with different seasonings.  I ordered steak fajitas which came out hot, tender and delicious.  A lot of veggies and a lot of nice spices.  I ordered a slide of dulche De Leche, which was so good.  

My bill, with a 30% tip only came out to $20, which I thought was very reasonable.

The restaurant is located in a nice little plaza area with a cool looking courtyard, surrounded by an office building and a sweet looking Cathedral, a few blocks from Chace field.  I was glad I went here.
