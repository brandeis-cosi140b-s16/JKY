So happy to find this local establishment!  The husband and I were wanting something quick and filling after working on house renovations and after a desperate yelp search, I found Los Taquitos with numerous complimentary reviews.  When we arrived, we were underwhelmed by the boxy feel of the interior -- the restaurant is essentially a box with tables around the perimeter and down the middle -- but the place was clean and everything smelled great.  What we DID appreciate was our food.  Really nice flavors, very filling, and fresh.  My husband got a veggie burrito and it was huge.  I ordered the veggie bowl and really liked the hashbrown-style potatoes (and the beans...and rice... and veggies...and sauce...).  Prices are reasonable (about $14 for the two of us) and wait time was pretty short.  If you are ever in Ahwatukee and are craving some Mexican eats, check out Los Taquitos.
