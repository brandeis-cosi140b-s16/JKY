I really enjoy this place...been now a few times and have had good experiences. I recommended coming here with a friend who was visiting from out of town to grab a drink and she was also impressed. The house margarita with a chamboard float is great! We also ate the coconut calamari appetizer....phenomenal! The chips are also a bit unique but are delicious! Saturday night was a bit crazy but would recommend to go for a fun time and good food/drinks!
