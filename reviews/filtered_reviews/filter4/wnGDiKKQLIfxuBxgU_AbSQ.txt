Tried Joyride for a late night taco dinner. The atmosphere was very hip and trendy, fun and inviting. We almost felt like we were back in San Diego! The wait was a bit long but we found out it was worth the wait. The staff was very friendly as well. They have delicious chips and salsa, we couldn't stop eating them! My boyfriend ordered three of the beer battered fish tacos and I ordered three tacos as well, beer battered fish, Carnitas, and chicken. For our side dishes my boyfriend had black beans and I had the orange and cucumber salad. I thought the Carnitas and fish tacos were fantastic although I didn't care for the chicken. My boyfriend said the black beans were fine and my salad was okay. I put a little salt and pepper on it to make it less bland, maybe more than two mini oranges? We did feel the prices were a little high for tacos. However, because the tacos and chips and salsa were so tasty we would absolutely recommend this place, we'll definitely be back!
