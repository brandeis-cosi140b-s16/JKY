On a nice day Steel Cactus is pretty legit, not gonna lie.

Hanging out on Walnut Street in Shadyside requires a certain fortitude and Steel Cactus delivers it!! 

I came in and posted up with a few friends at a table right by the bar and closest to the open windows allowing one to see Walnut street. On my particular visit, the iPhone 5 was being released, so it was fun looking at all the Apple peeps waiting in line to get their hands on the newest parcel of apple products. 

I went with the Yinzer Margarita that comes with an upside down bottle of Corona in a giant margarita glass. It was mois bien. 

For the fare, I went with the Mahi Tacos, or some kind of fish tacos, and they were spot on. Just as good if not better than Mad-Mex that's for certain.

I'll be back Steel Cactus. You can count on that...
