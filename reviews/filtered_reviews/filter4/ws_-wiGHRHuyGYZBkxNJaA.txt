Pretty cool new place. My Friends Dubs and Becca H. Introduced me to this place. Apparently they are everywhere in Utah. 

I ordered the special fish tacos. One of my favourite dishes anytime I eat "Mexican" food. They were actually really good. Great Flavor and the tortillas were a good pair. Sides were just meh...

This place is loud. Everytime someone orders nachos the entire staff breaks into a nacho inspired rendition of Macho Man.... Its hilarious at first but in the end can be obnoxious after 10 times. Then to have to go home to a 7 year old with it stuck in his head. Not the business. 

I'd go back. My kid ate free, and that's always a plus. 

Trying something different next time. Everyone's plates looked really good.
