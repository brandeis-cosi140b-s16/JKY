The service is usually really great. I say that because only 1 night have I questioned this and it was a party of 20+. The food is great and comes out very fast. The location can not be beat, who doesn't love the Tivoli Village area? They have a margaritas with a beer and a shot attached which can creep on you so be cautious when ordering this stinger.  Enjoy a lovely evening under the stars or indoors. We personally love their patio.
