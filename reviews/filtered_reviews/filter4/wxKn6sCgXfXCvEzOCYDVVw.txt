Back on the patio enjoying some lovely weather and lousy Monday night football. Finally tried the food and the Poblano Chicken Enchilada's ($12) were the choice based on nice waitress suggestion. Food could have been a touch hotter and the wrong side came out with meal, but the entree was good as the enchilada's had nice white meat chicken and just enough cheese on top to not get in the way of the flavor of the sauce. The sauce also had some good moments as it was not spicy, but still had flavor. The side issue was corrected right away and the smashed potatoes were interesting for a Mexican place, but tasty as well. I think they should have football specials on beers, but nothing broke the bank.
