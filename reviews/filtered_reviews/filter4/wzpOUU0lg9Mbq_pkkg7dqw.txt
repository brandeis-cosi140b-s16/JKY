Solid restaurant, I went here b/c it was close the Mesa Arts Center ([rave] that place is awesome! [/rave]) and was pretty pleased with the experience.  I'd heard good things about it on Chowhound, and so was expecting solid food.  They have a very New Mexican menu that seems to be heavy on the seafood special.  I got the blue crab enchilada and was quite pleased with the flavors and freshness of the sauce and rice, while the enchilada itself was literally stuffed with tender, moist crab.  I also had a delicious prickly pear margarita.  

The atmosphere is kind of interesting: the decor is surprisingly stylish, with the specials written in chalk on several big boards on the wall, and an inviting, pleasing palette of colors throughout.  The open layout was kind of funky, and I was a bit disappointed there were no booths in the entire place.  You could tell they didn't have a huge remodeling budget when they opened, but they did pretty well with what they had.  The neighborhood isn't great, but I don't hold that against the place.  I do think the time is ripe for a West Mesa revival, a la 7th and Melrose or the Sunnyslope area.  You heard it here first...  (I really need to get a blog again)

Overall, a good-to-great experience, and I'll definitely plan on going there again prior to MAC shows, but I doubt I would drive out to downtown Mesa to eat there again just for itself.  It's not quite a standout in a pretty crowded genre, but it's certainly a solid choice for those in the area.
