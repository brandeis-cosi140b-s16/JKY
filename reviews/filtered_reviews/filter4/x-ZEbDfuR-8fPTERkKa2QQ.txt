This time we went for lunch to sample their lunch/dinner entrees.  We are looking for a "go to" Mexican restaurant close to our home that we can frequent whenever the desire for Mexican food hits us.  Today we tried their carne asada and cheese enchilada plate, that comes with rice and beans, and two muffin sized tortilla cups of pico de gallo and guacamole.  It was very good so now we have a new "go to" place!
