My second experience based on the food was so much better. I got the Taco Salad with Steak, it was huge and packed with ingredients. When you think salad you think healthy, I don't think this one is. Not a lot of veggies in here, but so good none the less.
Now on to customer service. We had 6 orders to place to be ready by 12 so we called it in around 11:15 and we pretty much got scolded for calling to early, how do we know how long it'll take, how busy you are, etc ? He took the order be enforced the do not call early next time rule. We considered using them to cater our "lunch and learns" but now are second guessing our decision.
Pick up was smooth and friendly. All the orders were correct and labeled. Everyone liked their food.
