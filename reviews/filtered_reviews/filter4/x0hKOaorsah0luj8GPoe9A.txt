Great tacos! Ordered 6 Carne Asada tacos. They were packed with meat, onions and cilantro and had great flavor. Awesome staff, very friendly. My wife and I had long conversations with the Owner and Cook on how they make their food. Had a great time watching local Metal acts. When I am in Vegas, I am always looking for places not on the strip to eat. I will definitely be revisiting Yayo Taco when I come back.
