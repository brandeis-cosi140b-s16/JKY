FIRST, its authentic and original...has been here in that location since i can remember...
the service is awesome and the atmosphere is quite festive with the decor and the mariachi's moving around the room...

its a large menu, so everything is not awesome but overall.... my meals and experiences there have always been acceptable...i just love the service! 

my only suggestion to lindo...please learn what a REAL michelada is... pouring clamato juice in a jar and adding spices is something my four year old can do!
