We passed this place because it's attached to the Sapphire. When we realized where it actually was, we almost didn't go in. Surprisingly, though, almost everyone dining at ED was what I would call a "normal"--i.e., not a recent visitor to the Sapphire.

Short story: Do not be dissuaded by the Sapphire. 

ED has Excellent Mexican food. We had one of each of the street tacos, as well as guacamole and a salad.  Everything was high quality, particularly the al pastor and cochinita tacos.  The chips weren't great, but otherwise, everything was very good. 

For those who care, the place is very nice on the inside.  They seem to have a lot of specials--happy hour, etc--so much so that the servers forget some of them.  In fact, our $1 tacos special didn't actually make it onto our ticket. 

This strikes me as the kind of place that, in a different city, might have started out as a well-loved food truck and then transitioned into a better spot than where it actually ended up. (I wish that it were in downtown, for example.) That being said, we'll definitely be back.

Chef Paco came by our table, and seemed genuinely excited about his food.  I think he has every reason to be.
