Mercadito. Merca-dank-o. Yes, I am a fan. I discovered this place at a Yelp Elite Event.

First and foremost, this is a tapas style restaurant that serves Mexican-Fusion food. So if you're expecting authentic Mexican cuisine, look elsewhere. What you will find instead is modern twist on Mexican classics. Food here is fresh, tasty, and full of unique and crave-able flavors. 

Mercadito is best with a group, so that you're able to sample a wide variety of their menu. I haven't found anything on the menu that wasn't extremely tasty.

Stand outs (aka order this or your just playin') are: Mac & cheese, guacamole, tacos (all varieties), elote, and the chile rellano.

The cocktails here look extensive and intricate. No simple margarita will suffice here. If you're looking for some master mixology, this is your place. Especially if you have a thing for tequila.

I haven't had a bad experience here. Services is prompt, friendly, and courteous. The restaurant itself is covered in candy skulls and bright vibrant colors. (Pro-tip: all the servers wear red Adidas kicks.)

Can't wait to gather some friends and split a basket of tortilla chips with the homies, deciding to salsa or guac first... Probably both.
