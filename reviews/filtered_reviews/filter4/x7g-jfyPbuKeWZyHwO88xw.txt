What a fun place...Mexican and Chinese on one menu. And, it's Jose Andres so you know it's good. 

We tried five items:
-Tuna ceviche- fabulous! Fresh and delicious which a hint of crunch. 
-Traditional Shu Mei- light and flavorful. We loved these. 
-When Pigs Fly- we love pork buns and these didn't disappoint. It's a pretty heavy dish though.
-Carnitas tacos- nice flavor on the pork. Really good.
-Barbecoa tacos- good, but we liked the carnitas better.

If you want to enjoy a leisurely meal, I'd recommend ordering one dish at a time. Our server said he'd bring them out slowly for us (we ordered all at once) and we were out of there in about an hour which is not a leisurely meal in my opinion. 

Also, many reviewers commented on small portions and high prices. I disagree on both comments. The portions were bigger than tapas and the prices were really fair (for Vegas). 

I'd definitely go back!
