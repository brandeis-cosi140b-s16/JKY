I love finding great food spots in unexpected places. After hearing the buzz for Chile Verde Express, I had to check them out for myself. 

Inside a convenience store at a gas station, this place was busy when I arrived. It's basically a one man show. The guy took orders and cooked and did it all in a very efficient way. The wait wasn't long for my chicken nachos and he was so accommodating. He wanted to make sure everything was as I wanted it. He fried the chips up fresh, which was a treat. The chile was nice and spicy as well. They have mild as well, if you prefer. The chicken was a bit on the dry side, but a few pieces of carne asada snuck their way into my nachos and they were very moist and flavorful. I'll be getting that next time I come in. 

Service was friendly and I look forward to trying more of their menu out soon. I wish they had a drive thru since this location tends to get pretty crowded with the gas station, convenience store and car wash all in one area. Still a great little spot for cheap and fresh Mexican fare. Just make sure you come during off hours to avoid a long line.
