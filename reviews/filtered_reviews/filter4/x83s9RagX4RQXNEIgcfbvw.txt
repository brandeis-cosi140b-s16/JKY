This place was pretty good. I haven't explored much of the Mexican cuisine in Pittsburgh, so I don't have much to compare to but I would definitely go back! The wait was kind of long and the place was crowded, but it was a Friday night so that's to be expected. I got one of their combinations and I was pleasantly surprised by the portion size. The chips and salsa were a good starter, the margarita was good, and even with all of the busy-ness we still had great service!
