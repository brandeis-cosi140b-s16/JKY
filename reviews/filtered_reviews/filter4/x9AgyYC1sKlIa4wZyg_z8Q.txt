First time here. Lived in Vegas for 12+ years. Service was GREAT (KIM). Menu is a variety of things, I think it's trying to please everyone. The Nacho Cheesy Nachos are Gas Station-like Nachos and would've been impressive if there were more and maybe a scoop of Sour Cream, Guacamole and Pico de Gallo. Mexi-Cobb salad was THE BOMB! Filet Mignon Street Tacos were Really Good. Four Stars is due to Menu and Nacho App.
