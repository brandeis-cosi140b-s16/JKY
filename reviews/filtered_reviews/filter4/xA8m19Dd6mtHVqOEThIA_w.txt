Before a night of heavy drinking, packing my belly full of Mexican food always seems like a good plan.  I like this place because in the land of pricey dining, it is pretty inexpensive.  They have great salsa, and really good food.  Not the best enchilada taco combination ever, but right up there...and they aren't shy with serving sizes.  I would be happy to eat there again.
