Loved this place!!!!  Had the guacamole "Joyride" style.   Soooooooo yummy.  Tried the carne asada tacos and the crispy fish tacos.  Absolutely delicious.  Great service, friendly staff.  Only had to wait about ten minutes for a table for lunch.  I plan on going back to try the other taco options on the menu........
