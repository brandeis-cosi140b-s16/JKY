Tried this place based on a tip from a friend at work and glad I did. I tried the Del Rey which is thier largest sandwhich, Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, sausage, chorizo, tomato, lettuce, avocado, eggs and who knows what else was on there. I could only eat half. Now I have never had a Torta before so I have nothing to compare it to, But it was delish, my wife has a burrito which she also liked. Service was excellant, very friendly staff. They were playing Vicente Fernandez videos on the flat screens why we were there for luch providing some background ambience.  For Dessert we had Fresas Con Crema which was to die for. It wasn't on the menu, so just request it.  The only con was the limited parking but well worth waiting to find a parking spot. Can't wait to go back I heard the ceviche rocks.
