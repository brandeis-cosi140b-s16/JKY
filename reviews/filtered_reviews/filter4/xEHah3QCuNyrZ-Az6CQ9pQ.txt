I discovered Fuzzy's in Texas (Arlington) summer '11 after graduating college. Realizing I hadn't yet hit the proverbial jackpot that everyone speaks of after you graduate, I found my way to Fuzzy'$ Taco $hop. Sooooo good and soooooo cheap!! 

You'll find their slogan, "Welcome to Your New Addiction"  plastered over everything! Cups, t-shirts, walls, etc., and the slogan doesn't lie! My first time trying Fuzzy's I went back twice in the same week!

I was in Scottsdale visiting a friend in spring training and we LOVE Mexican food! We popped into the Tempe location which is situated near the university and the hot spots where students hang. This location is poppin' with a bar/club (Vintage) located directly above the restaurant. Very different from the family-friendly location in Agg-Town.  If I had to guess, Fuzzy's is the booty call you LOVE to have at the end of every crazy party night! I literally close my eyes and smile when biting into their tasty tacos! There's a bar inside for all my lushies, and reasonable prices to boot!! If you're looking for attentive service this isn't the place. Just order your food, pick it up when your number is called and enjoy! We ate Fuzzy's twice that weekend since I miss out on good Mexican food in DC. Solid. Delicious. Cheap.

For about $40 bucks we got 5 shrimp tempura tacos, queso, chips, and two margs! SCORE!!!   

Traveling on a budget? This is your spot if there's one in your area!  LOVE the upbeat  Tempe location!
