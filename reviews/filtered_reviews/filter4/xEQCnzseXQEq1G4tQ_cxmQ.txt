The decor of this restaurant, in the very charming Hotel Saguaro, is very trendy and bright.  The use of bright colors and unusual pieces for decorating is tasteful and interesting. 

We ate here twice, and the food is excellent.  The tacos, ceviche, and drinks, were good.  The outdoor patio with firepits is really great.  I am not familiar with the chef or his other restaurants, but he seems to be well known.  The food had well balanced flavors, intriguing textures, and overall was high quality and really well presented. 

Service here was not bad, but definitely was spotty.  We went long stretches with no ability to place orders or get questions answered.  Our server was friendly, but definitely was either distracted or just too busy. 

One more note:  the location of this restaurant, with the patio facing the performing arts center, and the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, is perfect.  A great place to relax, or people watch, depending on the time of day.  If you're here at the end of the day and are staying in the hotel, this is a great spot to relax before heading to the room.  If you're starting here, then this is a great place to plan the evening's adventures.  Overall, a great location.
