I'm going to start off with their service-- because they were so friendly! When we were done with our food, he let us know we didn't have to clean, thanked us, and even the lady in the kitchen thanked us, lol. 

We ordered 2 elotes, one in a bowl and one on the cob. While we waited, he started us off with some chips and salsa; very addicting! I am so glad I found out about this place, because I would previously drive so far for non-authentic, over-priced elote. The way they prepare their's is perfect! They are very generous with the spread, and they give you a chili shaker so you could add spice to your liking. 

Was not expecting much from such a small, random restaurant that I found on Yelp. Will be back to try more food, possibly will be the first place I rate 5 stars.
