One of my girlfriends and I decided to take a trip to Charlotte and splurge and stay at the Ritz Carlton. This restaurant was across the street so we ended up here purely by location. The food was good- I had tacos, she had one of the soups- but nothing that stood out entirely. Service was above average but our waitress could have been more attentive to our water refills. I recommend it for a good lunch, and I suggest sitting outside if the weather is pleasant.
