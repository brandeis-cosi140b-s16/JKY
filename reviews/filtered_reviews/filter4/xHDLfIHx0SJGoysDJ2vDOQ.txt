My husband just had to try this place way before the renovation because of the Diners Drive ins and dives place featured them at one point. Really great street tacos and quesadillas! The chicken on the salad is a little dry so I'd recommend getting it on other things. The new renovation looks great and gives the place more room for sure! It is our go to place for tacos.
