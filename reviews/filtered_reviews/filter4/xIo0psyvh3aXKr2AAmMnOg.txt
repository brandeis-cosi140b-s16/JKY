Finally got to try this place today.  We've attempted to come a couple of times but were deterred by the two hour long wait.  We went in today (a Saturday) at about 4:45, and there was no wait!  The tacos were really good.  We especially liked the fish taco and the braised beef taco.  The ahi taco was not impressive at all.  The guacamole was pretty good... not amazing but good.  Drinks were good.  Loved their salsa that comes when they seat you.  Very fresh!  I'd definitely go back, but I would never wait two hours for it.
