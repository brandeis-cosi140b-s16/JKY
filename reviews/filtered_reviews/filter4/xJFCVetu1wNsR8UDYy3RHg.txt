A fancier Tacos El Gordo! I'm loving the feel of this place. Although I think Tacos El Gordo is pretty darn delicious, this place seems way more sanitary! There's so much to choose from! I'd probably come here over Gordos! It's pretty spacious too! There's even an upstairs you can go to dine. 

Last visit I got -- Corizo taco, carne tostada, and El Pastor taco. My favorite was the Corizo. It had just the right amount of heat to it where I didn't even have to put extra salsa. But of course I did anyways because I  just love the heat! Lol the Carne tostada was my least favorite. The crunch the tostada had had a burnt taste to it that I didn't like. It was kind of hard to eat. BUT, the carne was cooked to perfection. The el pastor was pretty amazing too although next time I'm gonna have to ask for no pineapple! YUCK! I hate anything sweet when I'm eating something savory! My taste palette doesn't know what to do! 

HH isn't really that great. $2 tacos and $1 off their beer and house wines. Barely missed HH but oh well.
