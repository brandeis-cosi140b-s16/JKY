Oh man, am I the only one who loves Macayo's??  

They have great chips that are always served extremely quickly, and delicious salsa that they will readily fill back up.  Whenever my coworker and I feel like eating fatty, unhealthy food, we always go there for the Baja Burro - oh my gosh...so good!  It is a burrito, filled with either chicken, steak or shrimp, covered in baja sauce and cheese.  Its freaking delicious!  You can also get a bean and cheese burrito Baja Style if you choose and they will add all of this deliciousness to your bean and cheeser.

I want to go for happy hour and try their new watermelon and honeydew margs because those sound delish.  Anyway, I totally recommend this place for a quick lunch, I've never been disappointed and never left even remotely hungry.  In fact, most times I feel I need a wheelchair.
