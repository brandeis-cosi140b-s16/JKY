A friend suggested this place and when I walked in I could tell it was popular but I went right up to the counter.  I told the guy I'd never been there before so he offered samplers of their popular items.  But then I was confused.  The menu is Chines style pictures on the wall, but the guy was describing a combo platter.  So the menu presentation is horrible (for newbies).  Then when I finally figured out what to order, he went into explaining how to order next time with all their shorthand- even more confusing- and the assumption is that I'd be eating there every day.  BUT, the food was AWESOME.  I can't believe my mother in law lives like a mile from here.  Now when my wife says she wants to visit her mom, I'll be mor enthusiastic about making the trek!
