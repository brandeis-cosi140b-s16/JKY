Food was very good and my margarita wasn't bad. 
I had the beef enchiladas, one in red sauce and one in green. They were tasty as was the rice and beans.
Service was average.
The only reason for loosing a star was the limited menu.
Waiter was engaging and discussed the two sauces on my plate. He asked for my opinion on preference.
