I first learned about Chino Bandito when the Chandler location just opened. And at that time I was a huge fan. I remembered how much I loved anything in the quesadillas. The cheese and tortillas were a perfect combination with something like sweet and sour pork...who would have thunk it!!!

I have in the last few months gone to Chino's 2 times. I have always gotten my fall back the Jade Red Chicken Quesadilla, it is so good! And I have tried their Chile Relleno. Which is so interestingly unique. Who ever came up with the idea of using Chinese Wontons crushed up as the coating of the Chile Relleno deserves an Award! Who doesn't love Chinese Wonton!?!?! 

Don't forget the Black Beans, which are spicy and combined with the Jerk Fried Rice, YUMO! The best sides to your already unique and fun meal.

I think the best part is when people see your food and you tell them Chinese Mexican Food. Their reactions are priceless! 

This is not healthy food, this is not food to eat regularly, but every once in a while it is a darn good meal!
