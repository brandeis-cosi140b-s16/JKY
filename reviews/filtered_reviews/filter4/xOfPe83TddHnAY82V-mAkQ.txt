Dick's really is hidden away. I had been to Luci's next door several times and hadn't noticed it. DH has a bar right as you walk in and a small dining area in a separate room to the right. The menu is very similar to its sister restaurants, the Rokerij and Richardson's. Great happy hour with a solid margarita and really tasty appetizers; I like the carne adovada sliders, chipotle ribs, and the quesadilla. DH, like its sister restaurants, is on the pricier side but very well worth it.
