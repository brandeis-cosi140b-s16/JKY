Went with a group for a Saturday happy hour because of reading about them in the Best of Phoenix.  Sat outside and had great atmosphere.  The outdoor seating was great because the table held 8 and was very comfortable.  We ordered several different apps and had the happy hour margarita's and we were not disappointed. The service was excellent and the waiter was always attentive.  
Although nothing stood out as AMAZING, the overall vibe was good and and I would def go back again.
