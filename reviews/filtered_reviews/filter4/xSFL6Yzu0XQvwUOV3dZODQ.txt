I have to say this particular visit was outstanding.  I had the osso bucco... all I can say is.. OMG tasty goodness!

The Roasted garlic platter is always a favorite and we had some tasty oysters as well.  The cheese rich garlic platter which I've found can be hit or miss at other restaurants, was spot on, delicious, soft excellent.   The Oysters were as good as anything I've had in town.    Phoenix isn't exactly an Oyster hotspot.  They were tasty though.  

I think the patio will be excellent when it cools down a bit and look forward to visiting again.

Well done!
