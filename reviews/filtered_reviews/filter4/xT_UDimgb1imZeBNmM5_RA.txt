We've loved traveling around the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex trying the spots on Guy Fieri's show Diner's, Drive-In's, and Dives.  So, we used that show as a guide for where to eat on a recent trip to Scottsdale, AZ on vacation.  We were not disappointed.  Granted, we like casual dining.  Especially on vacation.  Shorts, t-shirts, sandals kind of places - but with good food.  We liked Chino Bandido.  It's in a whole-in-the-wall kind of strip mall, and the ambiance is non-existent.  But, we enjoyed our meals and were disappointed that we ran out of vacation before we had stopped at all of Guy's hot spots.  By the way, these aren't low-cal places.  I gained 3 pounds on vacation by eating at Guy's choices.  I've been running laps around the high school in our town taking off the vacation weight.  It reminded me of going on a cruise - nothing to do in Arizona in late June but eat out and hang out by the pool.  But, it was an awesome vacation and I recommend Chino Bandido to anybody who is adventurous.
