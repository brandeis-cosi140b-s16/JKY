Keeping up with my belief that the more sketchy a place is the better, Chino Bandido delivered. 

I had the sweet and sour chicken with fried rice and what was $6 of food tasted like $10+. The fried rice had a mushroom presence as well ^^

I also appreciated the salsa
It appealed to my spicy side~

Like Jeff said below the food is surprisingly not oily and msg-laden.

Only in America would I find Tex-Mex and American Chinese food in such a happy marriage.
