Our server, Chip, was awesome! Very fun, friendly, and helpful. In spite of the "rush" of the dinner crowd he gave us attention and did so in a calm and composed manner. 

The food was great! Two of us got "the Monterey" and the other got the "Enchiladas de Cozumel." We also got an appetizer of three dips. All was delicious. 

I also liked the wall murals and nifty technology at the tables that allowed us to pay without waiting.
