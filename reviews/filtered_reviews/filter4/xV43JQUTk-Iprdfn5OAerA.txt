The last time I was at Mi Patio had to have been at least 7 years ago.  I had not returned not because of bad food or bad service, I had simply too many things going on.  So after a long time away, I visited a few days ago and NOTHING has changed.  It is still the yummy food that I remembered.  It is small but cozy.  The staff is friendly and eager to help.  The food is very good and it does not take long for the food to arrive.  Heads up, the chips and salsa are addicting.
