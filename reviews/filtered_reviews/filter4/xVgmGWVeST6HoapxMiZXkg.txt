I would say taco shop is a misnomer. It is a small restaurant/ bar. Very interesting food, not typical "Taco shop" fare by any means.

Ive been there a few times now, their quesadillas are more like calzones, very tasty!
Portion size is good.Their chocolate cake is a must order.

They have a strange salsa bar, a lot of "novelty" salsa. Interesting for sure.

The paper and plastic baskets instaed of plates is one thing, but, too nice inside for use of the cheapest plastic flatware ever made, (not even the decent ones) Please buy bulk stainless @ Costco. That plastic is useless, hard to eat with.

I would recommend this place for sure.
