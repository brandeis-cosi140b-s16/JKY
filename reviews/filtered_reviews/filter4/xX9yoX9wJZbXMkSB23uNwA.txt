Who would think that a fusion of Mexican and Korean would work?  Well, it does.  It was fun to check out all of the different options.  The prices are low and the flavor was high...great combo.  I tried four different things, all of which I enjoyed, but the Kim Chee fried rice was my favorite.  

The restaurant was a hole in the wall, but I guess it will keep the prices down if the rent is low.  

I would have liked to see a soda fountain, but not too big a deal.
