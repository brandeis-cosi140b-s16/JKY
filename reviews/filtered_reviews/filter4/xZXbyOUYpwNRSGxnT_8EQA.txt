Yummy! This is a go to place when we have visitors in town and don't want to spend  a lot of money on the strip. The drinks are large and delicious. The food is good - loved my carnitas and the shrimp tacos! The chips and salsa are flavorful. Ambiance is okay - feels a little commercial but its in a mall so what do you expect?
