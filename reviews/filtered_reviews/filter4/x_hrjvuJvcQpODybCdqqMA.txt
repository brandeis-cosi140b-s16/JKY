This was our first stop after we got into Vegas.  I'm usually doubtful of Mexican places inside casinos, but I trusted Yelp and y'all did not let me down.

I had already eaten a bit before my flight so I only ordered the masa corn cakes appetizer (less than $10... I want to say around $8?).  They were yummy!  I liked the presentation (uploaded photo above), and they were crunchy with plenty of meat.  This was a perfect sized appetizer and/or light dinner entree.  I also tried some of my friends' refried beans, which were seasoned and smooth and one of the best I've ever had.  The chips and 3 different kinds of salsa brought out were also excellent.  Prices were very affordable for Vegas, and it's in TI, which is one of my favorite casinos.  Definitely worth a stop!
