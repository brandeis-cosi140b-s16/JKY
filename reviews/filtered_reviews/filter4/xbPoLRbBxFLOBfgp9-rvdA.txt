I love Pinches Tacos. It's a little pricier than most taco places out here and it's out of my way. But if I'm ever downtown (which is pretty often these days) this is always my go to place. I can't come here without getting an elotes. It's my favorite. The lengua and el pastor are always my choice of tacos. Both flavorful and tender.
