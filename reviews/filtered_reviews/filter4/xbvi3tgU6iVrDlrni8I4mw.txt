Fried food, trashy decor, a part of greater Phoenix that you'd have no reason being in...It's greasy spoon eating at its best!

I stopped at this place on the way to a vacation in Sedona since it's off the highway toward Sedona. It was recommended by Drive-In's, Diner's, and Dives, a.k.a. Triple-D, so I figure it couldn't be too bad.

Just don't call it Chinese. Don't even call it Mexican. But it's darn good food!

There's lots of good variety, and all the dishes are really unique and tasty. Don't know what to get? Ask the order-taker for a sample. Everything I had was good.

And I love the restaurant's devotion to its suggestively racist mascot, a panda with a sombrero, long mustache, and ammunition sash, Pancho Villa-style. They even have a freaking statue of him in the middle of the restaurant, standing proud and tall, as if he were a Buddha waiting for restaurant patrons to bow down to him or present him offerings of Diablo Chicken and Snickerdoodles. All is good though, it only adds to the restaurant's eclectic-ness.
