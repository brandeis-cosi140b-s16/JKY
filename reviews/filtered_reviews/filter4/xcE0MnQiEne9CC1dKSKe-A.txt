Good Mexican Mexican food. Generous portions, good flavor, been in Scottsdale for a very long tome and has been recognized locally for it's food quality, I'm hooked on the flour tortilla chips! You can request to have only flour instead of the corn and flour mix they usually bring. Salsa is more salsa fresca than blender salsa. Outdoor patio has misters and is very quaint. Good Eats...
