My friends mispronounced the name so I thought I was agreeing to an Italian meal, but was pleasantly surprised.  My gf doesn't usually like Mexican food, but both she and I walked out saying we'd surely be back.

The best point here is the service.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good, but the service is terrific.  The hostess and servers are all very personable.  And if it's their table or not, all servers are looking around the entire restaurant to see that everyone is happy.  Can someone teach other restaurants this simple lesson?  

Food:  My gf really enjoyed her shrimp, in a very tasty sauce (I don't know which), and a big enough serving to provide leftovers.  I had the Huevos Rancheros, which are among the best I've had in Vegas.  Everywhere I go, I try the Rancheros and am typically disappointed.  It's become a running joke with my friends and me.  So when the waitress recommended it, we laughed, but she persisted.  Thank you!  

The waitress also recommended the sweet potato enchilada - delicious!  Not too heavy, and not too cheesy/saucy.  They've nailed this dish perfectly.  

My gf loved the flan, but I thought it was a bit too dense.  

Summary, this is a solid place to eat, with very reasonable prices.  This goes in our regular rotation.
