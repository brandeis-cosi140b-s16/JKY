Hecho is so delicious! Went there two weeks ago during a birthday trip to vegas. And I ordered the chicken nachos. They were perfectly done. And perfect flavor. And the table side guacamole was amazing! They make it fresh right in front of you and I thought that was a nice touch. But beware they DO charge an extra fee for that. And they don't tell you anything about the fee until the bill comes. Sorta sneaky? lol But it isn't very expensive. So wasn't a huge deal unless your really pinching pennies. And its worth every penny once you taste how good it is. All the staff there were extremely kind and helpful as well. Only complaint, and this part has nothing to do with my meal. LOL Was afterwards went to the bathroom and saw a waitress that worked there, use the restroom & then she walked right out without washing her hands. Im just thankful she wasn't the chef! But that was gross to see. Other than that, Hecho is a great spot for good mexican food in vegas for a reasonable price!
