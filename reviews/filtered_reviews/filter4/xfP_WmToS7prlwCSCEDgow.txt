I am from Texas and I have tried every variation of Mexican food you can imagine.  The food at Taqueria is basic, satisfying, and comforting.  There is also a sense of community at Taqueria that makes the place very special.   Go there with an open mind and keep your expectations at "great food for the price" and you won't be dissapointed.
