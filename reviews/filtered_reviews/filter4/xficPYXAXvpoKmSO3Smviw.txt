On our last visit, we had a little issue with security clearing the place out as soon as the band stopped playing...and they didn't do it in a good way.

This certainly wasn't going to stop us going back, but I did have a little email conversation with Mike the marketing Director concerning the issue. Needless to say it is always good to see someone checking sites like Yelp and actively trying to fix problems, so a big tip of the hat to Mike.

Anyways, yet another Thursday night spent watching our favorite ban (The Garage Boys) play at Diablo's, the crowd was a bit thin, but the boys put on a good show, the drinks were good and the atmosphere was....Actually, if you think about a group of friends sitting around a fireplace chatting away with your favorite music playing in the background, that what it was like. It is nice to have a place on the strip where you don't have to sell your first born to buy a round and where you can just hang out.
