Our first night in Las Vegas and we stumble upon this place! 

We managed to get a table just in time before the big crowd, but we did waited a bit. We and the guy in front of us waited possibly a good ten minutes before being seated.

 I wasn't fond of the lighting in there. It was green and pink lighting everywhere which makes the place seem dark and sketchy. I had a hard time seeing and walking through the place since it was so dim. 

Free appetizers came and it was chips and salsa! The chips were ordinary beside having actual pink chips tossed along with the plain ones. The salsa was alright, a bit too spicy for me but quite popular with my table seeing that they requested more. We ordered two of the specialty, the Pink Tacos, with both steak and chicken. So delicious! The garnish on top was perfect and the right amount of kick to it. No need for sauce on it. And on a closer inspection, I noticed that the taco were in fact pink, hence the name.  

I would like to go back for more, but I don't know if I want to go back to Vegas soon. ,
