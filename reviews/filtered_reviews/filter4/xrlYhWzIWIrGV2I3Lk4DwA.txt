The venue itself is beautiful but please do something about your staff/security. Is it really neccassry to hire a bunch of wanna be cops/MMA fighters that eye fuck everyone? I get that some of the shows can get a little "aggressive" but the staff honestly seems to antagonize more than they actually do their jobs.
