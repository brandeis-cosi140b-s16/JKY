Was looking for a decent Mexican restaurant off the strip and came across this little gem. I'll break down this review based off of the items I had to eat & drink.

Chips: Were super crisp fresh and delicious.  I found these chips much better than the average fair you find at a Mexican restaurant.

Salsa: They give you three different dips to try.  The bean dip is out of this world delicious, like others have mentioned it is really good.  The green salsa was more of a light Avocado salsa and had a nice flavor and just enough heat. The tomato red salsa was bland and watery with no flavor at all.  Was really disappointed with the red salsa compared to how good the others were.  

Cheese Enchilada: Probably one of the BEST I've had in quite awhile. The sauce had a rich deep flavor and the spices were balanced well. The tortilla was not soggy and filled with delicious gooey cheeses. 

Chicken Taco: The chicken was very flavorful although the tortilla was a little on the stale side.  The toppings were good but very minimal.  

Beans & Rice: One word OUTSTANDING! Really creamy beans that had a nice texture and the rice had some great flavor with the traditional peas in the rice.

Margarita: Had a Mango Margarita and it was average to good.  Nothing to special but nothing bad either.  

Overall a great experience with a very friendly staff.  "Freddie" was a great waiter who was super attentive and funny.  Well be back!
