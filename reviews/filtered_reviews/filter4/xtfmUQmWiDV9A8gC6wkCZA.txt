I love this place. It's beautifully decorated and the service is excellent. I have been here a few times and each time was consistently great. They are more one the "fine" mexican cuisine scale. They make an avocado mousse, that's like guacamole, only better. It's silky and creamy and oh so delicious. Their queso dip was excellent as well. Try their dip sampler it has the two I listed and one other. I've had a taco plate here and a quesodilla, both excellent.
