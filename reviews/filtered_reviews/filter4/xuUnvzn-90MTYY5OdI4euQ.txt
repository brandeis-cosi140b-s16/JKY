This place was amazing.  Everything ..... I mean everything tasted like it was just picked out the garden and cooked fresh.  The atmosphere was pleasant, the staff was super polite and engaging while we were there (I know, as opposed to when we were not there).  Serving sized were more then adequate, flavor was off the charts and prices were reflective of the quality product the cooks placed in front of you. My only regret is that I didn't get a chance to have the corn on the cob plate, which looked amazing on the other table (party of 16 all had one).  Monday night and it was busy with only a five minute wait. 
My wife had a enchilada, my daughter the burrito (enchilada style) and I had the Two Tacos, which actually had additional flour tortillas, so it was actually like Four Tacos. The cheesecake was probably the best I have had in Vegas.  Very surprised by this little slice of heaven we found.  We will definitely be back again and again.  Thank you .
