This is a hidden gem on Sunrise Mountain.  I have eaten at Mexican restaurants all across the valley and this is comparable to them all!  The chips and salsa are great!  I'm very picky about salsa and pico and both were gray, very fresh with just the right amount of kick. We had the chicken and steak fajitas and cheese quesadilla and all were very tasty!  The only "meh" was the rice, bland and mushy.  I won't quibble, however, as the prices are very reasonable and our fajitas were excellent and with a mountain of meat, so the prices can't be beat!  Like I said, I've eaten at Lindo Michoacan and this is much better!!  The beers are ice cold and the service was great!
