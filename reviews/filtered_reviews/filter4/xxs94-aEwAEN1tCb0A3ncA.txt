Abuelo's has become one of my favorite local restaurants over the last few months. My fiancé and I dine here often and the consistency has been very good. I often times order two cheese enchiladas with onions and rice and beans  and they are delicious. My fiancé enjoys the steak and enchiladas and the ribeye has been very good quality meat every time. The habanero salsa is phenomenal and you often times have to request it but I highly recommend doing so if you like spicy.

The service can be hit or miss but most times it is very good. The management overall seems to keep this restaurant running very smoothly and overall we have rarely had any issues. Abuelo's hits the spot every time! I will be back!
