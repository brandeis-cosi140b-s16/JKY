This restaurant is another proof point that if you want good food in Las Vegas, stay as far as possible from the Strip.  If you come here and leave hungry, its your own fault.  (Perhaps you left hungry because you don't like Mexican food, in which case, you probably should have gone elsewhere.)

The standard chip basket is served with a really tasty bean dip.  From there, I had a simple dish: huevos con chorizo y patates.  It's basically a breakfast scramble with Mexican ingredients.  I could tell that the chorizo was fresh and nicely spiced, and the eggs were high quality, too.
