I went to Blanco last night with a family friend of mine and we were helped by a server named Adam.  He was awesome!  Super nice guy and a great server.  

The ambiance of the place is cool, we sat on the patio and it was very comfortable, open patio setting.  I really enjoyed the layout and the lounginess of the place.  If lounginess is even a word?!  I think you get the point.  

I thought the food was good, that's the only reason I gave it a 4 star vs. a 5 star.  The food wasn't bad, I just didn't think it was OUTSTANDING.  Just pretty good.  

All in all, I would definetely return again.  I really liked this place.  Thank you Blanco!
