After visiting the Las Vegas Premium Outlets we decided to have lunch at Mundo. The restaurant was very busy on this Friday afternoon so it was fortunate that we held reservations.   We received a bowl of taco chips plus 3 housemade salsas.  We both ordered the jalape√±o chile spiced chicken enchiladas with roasted tomatillo sauce, salsa asada, melted chihuahua cheese and crema fresca.  Everything was very good including the service until our waiter was reassigned to duties at the bar.
