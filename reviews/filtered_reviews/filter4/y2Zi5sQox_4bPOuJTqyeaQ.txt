Well, I finally know where Rito's is. It's in the hood, surrounded by scary shit I don't like. 

Went to Rito's for lunch (don't think they are open for dinner nor would I go if they were) on the day after super bowl and every creepy tattooed head cholo in the neighborhood was there. I was freaked the hell out through my entire meal wondering if I should really be there. I grew up around these people, in Maryvale, and regularly go to Sunnyslope and have no issues. Maybe it was the fact there were no other white people nearby, and I was in the middle of a residental neighborhood, which made me feel as though I had walked into some gang's territory. 

I was still able to eat my meal though. I ordered the red chimi enchilada style. OH SNAP! That was the best chimi I think I have ever had. The food here is not eally cheap perse, but it is a cheap restaurant if that says anything. I wholeheartedly felt that I would go back on a regular basis if not for two things 1) it weren't in the location it's in and 2) it weren't so high fat.

At least go try it once, and take CASH.
