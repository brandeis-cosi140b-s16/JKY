Making the rounds on all the wonderful mexican food places the south side has to offer I found myself here. I can't believe how many times I have drove by this place and never stopped in. The dining room is humongous, you could probably fit 500 people in it.  It is a bit brightly lit but squint your eyes and dive into the salsa, it is really awesome. I must say I was not impressed with my lunch order, I got the tacos and they were dripping with grease. I think they make the tacos, lettuce tomatoes and all, then threw them in the fryer (yuck). I think I just made a bad choice though as the dishes others ordered, (fajitas and seafood plates) looked delicious. They give you a really yummy soup at lunch time. It consisted of broth, rice and veggies and was very flavorful. The waitress was sweet and attentive and the margaritas were great (if you like them made with limeaid, which I do).
