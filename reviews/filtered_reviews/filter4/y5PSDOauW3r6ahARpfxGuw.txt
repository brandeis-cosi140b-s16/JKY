Met some friends over here at cafe rio and had a fun lunch.

The environment was very home like.. Fun music and the design of the place feels live. 

The order was incredibly quick. I ordered a chicken quesadilla, checked my phone for a second, looked up and my food was ready. Lol. 

The food is Amazeballss. It wasn't the best I've had but for the price, it was delicious. And they got my favorite hot sauce too! Cholula!! 

The horchata deserves a 5star.
