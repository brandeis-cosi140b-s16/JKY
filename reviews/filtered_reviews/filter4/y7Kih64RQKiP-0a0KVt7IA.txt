I was dining alone and was offered a table outside on the patio overlooking the pool. View is nothing special but it was a beautiful day so it was nice to enjoy the fresh air. Server was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable on the menu. This was my first visit so I decided to try "The Ultimate Border Grill Experience" 3-course meal which offered a sampler plate of apps, and your choice of entree and dessert. I chose the grilled Skirt Steak and Tres Leches cake. All of the food was good and I had an enjoyable dinner before catching my flight back home.
