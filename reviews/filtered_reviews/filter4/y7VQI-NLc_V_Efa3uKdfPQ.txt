I have been going to Mi Patio for 20-some years, so it holds a special place in my belly.  

The salsa is some of the best around, but my secret trick is it mix it with some of their red hot sauce (you have to ask for it!) to give it that extra punch! I could eat their chips and salsas as a whole meal.

For being a more traditional Mexican joint, Mi Patio has fantastic vegetarian options (but beware of the rice!) and some quirky Greek food thrown in. The price to portion ratio is very fair and $9 will get me enough food for 2 meals. The service here is VERY quick - you can be and out in 45 minutes.
