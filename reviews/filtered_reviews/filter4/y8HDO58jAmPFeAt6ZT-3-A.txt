Javier's was absolutely delightful! 

We rolled into Vegas last night without making any prior reservations, but our party of 4 was seated promptly even though it was Christmas night. 

The decorations were very dark featuring chainsaw wooden art in the seating area. Our waiter was very knowledgable and told us about the art's representation of life through the passage of time. Speaking of our waiter, he was very attentive and extremely helpful as their menu selection is great. 

Yes, they're guacamole was awesome but pretty much everything on their menu is just as awesome. I got the chance to try their carnitas - it was slightly crispy on the outside and it was cooked so tenderly. The sauce it was served with was cilantro and limey and on point. Yum!

I ordered the cabo azul which features the star seafood entrees which include the lobster enchilada, crab and shrimp chile relleno, and the shrimp taco. Our waiter advised me to eat the shrimp taco first because of the coleslaw, and I was glad he told me so. It was refreshing and the fried shrimps were succulent and yummy. Lobster enchiladas were covered with this spicy green salsa that paired so nicely with the cool sour cream. The chile relleno was just okay, but I think it's just because chile relleno is generally not my most favorite Mexican option. 

Yes, this place is priced well above traditional Mexican options, but it's Vegas, the food is quality, the service is great, and it's a place worth visiting before your fantastic night out.
