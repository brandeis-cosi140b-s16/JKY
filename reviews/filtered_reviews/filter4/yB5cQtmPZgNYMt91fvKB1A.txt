The minute you walk in the door, you know you're exactly where you want to be. Amazing historic decor, tacos, daily specials on a hymn board... All senses engaged. 

I appreciate their inclusion of both old world and new world tacos. I recommend trying one from each camp: duck for the new, coffee-braised beef for the old. Duck was slightly too sweet, but not a deal breaker. Beef could use more jicama crunch, but no complaints in the flavor. Mmmm. 

The corn LOOKED amazing, but I wasn't hungry enough to get it. Definitely will next time. 

My cocktail was decent, but the waitress didn't have enough knowledge of the menu to guide me toward the best option for me. If you're going to drink, opt for the craft beer or straight tequila instead. 

Taco Guild is holy ground indeed. A Phoenix must!
