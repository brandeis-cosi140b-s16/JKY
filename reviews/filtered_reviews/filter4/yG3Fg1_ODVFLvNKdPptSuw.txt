Consistency is lacking, which for me is a lose! Last week I ordered the 6 pack of shredded beef tacos to go 3 nights in a row. Each night the 6 tacos came in 1 styro box, and were hot, crispy, and very good. They also came with chips, salsa, and hot sauce. I ordered another 6 pack to go last night. The lukewarm to cold tacos were not crispy, and came 3 to a styro box.....waste of a box, and more trash. I asked for NO chips and salsa, but I did not get any hot sauce either! I called, and a manager is supposed to call me. I only called to complain about the lack of hot sauce because it was before I ate the sub par tacos and was extremely disappointed. The chef that made my tacos the week before needs to teach the chef that made them on the night of 10/13/2015 how it is done! I really hate when food I have had before is totally different when ordering the same thing again.               UPDATE: I spoke with the manager the morning of 10/14/2015, and he was very receptive, and said he would speak with the kitchen manager. He also comped me a taco 6 pack which was very nice.
