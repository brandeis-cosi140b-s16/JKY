If Castle boutique and camelback were not at the front door I would have never known that I was in Phoenix.  Seems like something right out of Baja.  This place reminds me of some of the dive places that I have been in Mexico on the beach.  So if you are looking for Fast Food at reasonable prices that tastes great you should check it our.  Best part is that you don't need the Imodium after the meal like in Mexico.  

The day that I went had a green chicken taco special and I hope that stays one the menu.  I liked it much better then the bean and cheese or carne asada taco.  They also have a great selection of lemonade with flavors that I have never heard.  Make sure to bring cash... that is all they take!
