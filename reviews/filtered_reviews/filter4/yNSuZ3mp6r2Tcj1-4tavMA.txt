Went here twice in a two day span. First time was to have a beer or two at the taco stand-sitting under the misters watching the Strip on a sunny day-can't be beat! Anyways, it smelled so good while we were there that we decided to go back for lunch the next day.
I had a prickly pear margarita and the short rib tacos. Tacos were good, so were chips, salsa, and guacamole. The area under the trees is pretty and gives a nice shade on these hot summer days.
