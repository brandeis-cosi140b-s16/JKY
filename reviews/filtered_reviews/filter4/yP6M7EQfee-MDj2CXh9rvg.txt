Been eating here, and all their sister properties for years. I'll write more when I'm feeling more verbose, but had to quibble. THIS IS NOT TEX-MEX!!!! Hello Yelp, are you asleep at the switch on this? It's New Mexican, get it right. Calling it Tex-Mex is totally insulting to people from New Mexico. It would be like saying that Japanese and Chinese food is the same because they both use a lot of rice.
