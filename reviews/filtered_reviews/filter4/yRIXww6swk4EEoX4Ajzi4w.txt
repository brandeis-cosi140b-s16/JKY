My wife and I were really impressed by this restaurant.
We always drive by it, but now we'll make a point to actually go in!

The patio is perfect.  Happy Hour only goes until 6 PM, but frankly I'd pay more to sit on their comfy couches and just enjoy the scenery.

The food is terrific.  I tried three different types of tacos, and all were great.  We also shared a Cheese Crisp and some Sopapillas.  YUM.

Can't wait to come back.

ENJOY!
