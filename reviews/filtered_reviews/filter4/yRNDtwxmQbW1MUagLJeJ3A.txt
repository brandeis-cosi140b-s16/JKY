Diego is a somewhat upscale restaurant serving fine Mexican cuisine in the MGM Grand.
It provides an interesting decor for dining but does not go overboard on ambiance.
 
My only concern is that it is a bit pricey, but then again it sits in with all the other high end eating venues like Seablue and Pearl.

Diego has some excellent drinks. 
We had a Diego sampler with the 3 layer dip - an excellent choice with pre dinner drinks.

A signature of the restaurant is the guacamole prepared table-side.
I had the Carne Asada that came with tequila laced roasted cactus - 
an interesting touch ....... 
If it is available, I would suggest adding the sweet corn and cheese tamale - It just tasted great ....... made for an excellent meal.

My other minor complaint is that you are often seated so close to the next table it is almost like you are sharing dinner and you must concentrate not to intrude on their conversation.

Diego is a great choice while staying at the MGM........
