Authentic, innovative and delicious, Lindo delivers Mexican with flare! No need to ask for more chips/salsa/bean dip because they bring more before you are even done with what you have. Have been there at least 10 times and what brings me back is the nuance of spices in every dish. My favorite is the Gallo el Chipolte Estilo, a smoky, spicy, moist and tender chicken entree. Another in our party got the Gallo al conaq (lemon and garlic), something I would have never ordered.as it sounded too simple.. but one bite changed that! Love the Fideo soup they serve with every meal. Typical Mexican decor, cheerful and comfortable and a staff that aims to please. Good bang for the buck... $25 per person can get a great meal and mojito!
