I really liked this place! A small, authentic Mexican restaurant/cantina tucked away in the unlikely place of East Craig Road, you go in and the decor is comfortably rustic. The noise level was not an issue at all, very acceptable.

The food I received was perfectly done; it was a simple chicken breast marinated in lime juice and some other things I'm not certain of...BUT, the chicken was moist, not undercooked, not overcooked. Perfect! 

Prices were also extremely reasonable, even the drinks weren't that expensive.

I am really looking forward to coming back here to try some more of the awesome-looking Mexican dishes...I think I may try the mol√© next! :)
