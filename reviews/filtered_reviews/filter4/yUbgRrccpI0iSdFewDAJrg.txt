Finally a solid Mexican feast that can fit into my low-carb lifestyle! Skipped the chips and salsa, but ate the grilled onions and peppers that come with it! Those peppers have some heat to them. What a pleasant surprise!

Ok, so I read a few reviews that said the food is not spicy at all.  I lean toward my food extremely spicy. They happily brought out a dish of habanero sauce but gave warning to use very little, since it was extremely HOT!!! I think I was more amused as they watched the "little lady" (ME) douse my food in it and eat ALL of it. Love that they have the option of grilled veggies instead of rice and beans.  

I will say the carnitas was a bit dry and not the best I've had, but was fine with a bit of salsa and hot sauce mixed with all the veggies, it was more like a nice Mexican stirfry.    My husband got the "flaming" steak fajita, which is impressive at they brings it out a sizzling cast iron pan with a flame under it to keep it well...sizzling.  My husband enjoyed his feast of  fajitas with surprisingly flavorful rice, beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, guac, and  corn tortilla.  Guess what? We were pleased our food was not drowning in cheese, nor was needed or missed.  However, these servers were nice and attentive and I am sure they would have brought some cheese out if we requested.  

I am sure to be back, nice service, decent Mexican food (finally!).  The Cantina looks entertaining as it is big lined with tvs, has a full bar, and even an outdoor area,  but it was empty since it was just shy of noon on a Monday?  Luckily they also have 4 TVs in the dining area too.   The drink specials look decent, affordable, and even tasty. 

My one negative, is that I am not a fan of "rustic" aka cheesy Mexican decor and this place was dressed just like that...however, I focused my eyes on a 26th seed beating Serena Williams at Wimbledon.   Awesome that they had it on!
