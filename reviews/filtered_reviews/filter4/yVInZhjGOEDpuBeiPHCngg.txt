As I do with most places, I want to and for whatever crazy reason feel the need to leave some long ass review.  But this place already has enough of those.  
The Mission is certainly one of the Best Local Restaurants in AZ but I don't think its that amazing.  The drinks are incredible but expensive, the appetizers are so tasty but expensive, and the food is pretty damn good (but not over the top amazing) and expensive.  See a pattern? 
While I do like it here very much, I really think its just overpriced for what you get.  Certainly worth going a time or two though. 

(anyone that wants to buy me a Mojito here may fill out application. I'm accepting all applications.)
