Visited Hussongs Cantina this week for a "work lunch". Great location inside Mandalay Place. I liked the atmosphere inside and it wasn't very busy at the time I went so we got seated right away. The service was great and we got a large basket of chips with salsa quickly. They had a green and red sauce. I really liked the red sauce and didn't use the green.
For lunch I ordered the Enchiladas Suizas. It didn't take long before it was on the table. The portion size was good and the creamy tomatillo sauce was really good. The beans and rice were typical, nothing fancy. I look forward to visiting Hussongs Cantina again to try some other menu items and margaritas!
