I tried the restaurant for the first time last night . The place is a converted church . Concrete floors made the place noisy.  We were seated at the back of the restaurant . The hot sauce was mild but had good flavor.  We tried the guacamole with Serrano peppers. The peppers were mild . We really liked their grilled corn on the cobb. By the time I got to my burrito I was full . I had the steak burrito.  . Service was good except for the end when it came to get the bill and pay
