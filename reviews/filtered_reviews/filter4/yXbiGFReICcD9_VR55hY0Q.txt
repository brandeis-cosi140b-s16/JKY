We came here not knowing what to expect. It was pretty good! I ordered a beef tostada and it was what I was expecting. The rice was a little salty, but everything else was bland so it worked for me. 

My boyfriend ordered the combo.  There was a taco, tamale, and enchilada. The tamale was a bit spicier than I was expecting. The enchilada had enough cheese to mask any kind of spiciness. 

The sopillidias (not sure if I spelled it right) was interesting. I never had it before, but it was good. 

The chips and salsa was pretty good too. The chips looked a bit greasy, but over all satisfied with the Mexican food.
