We've been going to Frank & Lupe's for 5 years. We love their food. Sitting in their patio relaxing w/ a margarita seems like your in Mexico on vacation.
The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, is due to service. It can be hit & miss. The last few times it's been great....so maybe there's been a turn over in staffing? The guys working the packed patio last Saturday did a great job!!!
 Regardless, we love this place!  Try #25 w/ both shrimp & chicken.....it's awesome!!!!  Also, the ceviche & mini taco are really good.
