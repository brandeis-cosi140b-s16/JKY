Service was fabulous here, our server was super friendly and attentive. The food was delicious and our group of 11 was happy with where we landed, especially after the poor experience we had at the first restaurant we tried that night. o.O The food was delicious and the place was PACKED. In reality it is in a great spot so of course there is going to be a lot of foot traffic. They made room for our large group and were very accommodating, our starving group was appreciative!
