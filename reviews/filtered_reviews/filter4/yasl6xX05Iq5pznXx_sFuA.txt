Lunch at Two Hippies Beach House can turn a Monday into a fun-day. I discover something new every time I go - like the Village People album covers, bumper stickers, action figures and list of 10 worst rock songs.

I love going for lunch and getting a couple of tacos and sharing and order of chips and salsa. The tacos (and burritos) come with pinto beans, cheese, rice, cabbage, tomatoes, onions and a wedge of lime, but nobody squawks when you place a special order. (Big surprise, I 86 the tomatoes.) I've tried the fish, chicken, pork and carne asada tacos, and I think the fish are my favorite while the pork are a close second. The chips are store bought but the salsa makes it worth it. BTW, the tacos are cheap - $2 each. 

Their flavored lemonade is the bomb! I think I look for people to meet me there for lunch just so that I can get the blackberry lemonade. Pomegranate and raspberry are pretty tasty, too.

One of these days I need to try the red chili beef burrito...which gives me an excuse to go back.

I recommend carpooling if you're going for lunch. Parking is limited and the place gets busy quickly. They turn the food around fast, and you can always call ahead for a pick up order.
