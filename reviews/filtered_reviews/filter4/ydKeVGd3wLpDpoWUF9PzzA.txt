china poblano is such an interesting place. i think that merging dim sum and taqueria is really cool. the place is really cool. has very interesting art everywhere and its nice to sit at eithr of the two bars to watch them make tacos or dimsum.

i had ordered a singapore sling for my drink. i had no idea that any place had it besides the famous raffles hotel in singapore where it originated. it was soo good! very grapefruity, not too sweet. my friend had their specialty margarity wc was also amazing. they top it with this salted foam as opposed to rimming the glass with salt. very cool.

for food we had the unruly monk wc is a noodle soup dish. nothing crazy. i thought it was alright. we had the  other noodle soup dish with the corn truffles. very interesting, had a good spice to it and loved he corn truffles. we had the twenty vegetable fried rice. pretty good but pretty standard. we also had the nice but naughty bamboo shoot salad. very refreshing. love the heart of palm in it. a little mayonaise-ey at times.

on the mexican side we had the babrbacoa del res tacos. omg the beef was seasoned perfectly. so flavorful and cooked so well. the shrimp mojo was fantastic. perfect spice and had a roasted quality. the like water for chocolate was really interesting too. the lotus flowers were tasty.the sauce was fruity and on the berry side.

for desert we had the flan. very good with slices of roasted pineapples drenched in vanilla bean. and the ginger ice cream was great. i also had tried their sticky mango rice dessert. it is not your typical sticky amngo rice. it is the modern version. it was the deconstructed version.

all in all a great culinary experience with very interesting fusions. a greta menu, from lamb potsitckers to duck tongue! ambiance is great. casual and very fun. could get pricey once you start ordering you just cant stop! u wanna try everything! and it helps that its at cosmopolitan hotel, the best one on the strip right now.
