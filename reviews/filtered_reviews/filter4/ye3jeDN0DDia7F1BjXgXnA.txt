Ah, sweet gluttony! Poncho's is busy, loud, and has lots of personality. I really, really love the food here and I go if I'm around South Phoenix and want to eat until I pass out. I've been going here since I was little, and here are my recommendations:

Salsa (tons of it!)
Fried zucchinni (only available in the dining room)
Pollo fundido 

The to-go area is "meh." A lot of the menu options are not available to-go, including my beloved fried zuchinni.
