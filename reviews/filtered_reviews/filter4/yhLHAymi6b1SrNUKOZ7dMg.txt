I haven't been to this particular location before, so I wasn't sure if it would be like the old Dos that used to be on Uni by ASU.  But the NYF tournament party was there, so I had to go.  And I was a little hesitant because honestly...the party usually sucks.

However, I was totally wrong about this place!  The (free) margaritas were potent, beer was cold, chips were addictive, and the waitresses were very accommodating (and hot...that too).  They made sure we were constantly filled up, even if some people weren't tipping (bad juju!).

I didn't try the food, and I probably won't be back here unless I'm in this part of AZ again (which would be...same time next year), but if I could, I'd go back for sure.  Wish I had ordered food though, just to see how they were...  I never ordered their fish tacos, because when I was a student, i was more concerned with drinking as much as I could before getting booted as opposed to eating.
