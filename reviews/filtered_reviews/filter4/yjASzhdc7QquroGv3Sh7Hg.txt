I'm a big fan of Dick's Hideaway...but not a huge fan of Richardson's. There's something about all of that tacky Southwestern decor at Richardson's that makes me lose my appetite. Rokerij (pronounced ro-ka-ree) has all of the charm and coziness of Dick's without any of the tackiness of Richardson's. 

The food is different, too--it's an Amsterdam smokehouse theme. You'll still find specials written on chalk boards in the dining areas, so bring your glasses if you're near-sighted. My favorite dish is the tenderloin on a toast, covered with peppercorn gravy. The Rokerij salad is delicious--a version of the classic wedge sprinkled with chunks of bleu cheese, red onion and bacon.  If you're looking for some fantastic appetizers, order the small plates--the toasts with melted brie and tenderloin are great. It's a nice place to bring clients for lunch, but it would also make for an intimate first date. Great beers on tap if you don't want to check out their more than adequate wine list. I think it's the same menu for lunch and dinner. Both the main dining room (on the ground floor) and the basement bar come equipped with fireplaces and comfy furniture with those signature toss pillows. Warning: if you're wearing a skirt and you have to slide into the ultrasuede booth, you're going to show some leg. You can reserve either of the booths in the bar area if you have a larger group and want to make sure you have a seat.
