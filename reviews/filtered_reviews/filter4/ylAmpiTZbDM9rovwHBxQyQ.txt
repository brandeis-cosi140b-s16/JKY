We were strolling the Las Vegas strip looking for something different to eat and walked thru New York New York casino and stumbled upon this place. Actually the aroma is what really caught our attention. The seating is pretty tight here not the most comfortable but I am a trooper. Their customer service was excellent and on point. I had the carne asada tacos and I can honestly say I have never had asada that tender before it was very good. The Spanish rice and beans were good and their guacamole is excellent. I would definitely visit again when I'm in town, just not sure if I would order a drink from here, they were pretty weak.
