I was in the area and craving some Mexican food since it's getting cooler outside. 

I will admit I went in here totally skeptical and ready to be disappointed ...........but you know what......I wasn't!!! 

It was very clean, friendly and attentive staff, a window opened to the kitchen area to see the cooks in action. 

I was served chips with a salsa trio, there was chunky pico de gallo, smooth red and the tomatillo green. (see pics) 

All tasted OK, none were very spicy at all but that was fine with me. 
My favorite was the green, although I added some salt and lemon juice to it to make more flavorful it still was a great fresh sauce, I could have eaten it with a spoon!

I ordered from the lunch menu, where all items were $6.99. 
I chose the chicken melt it was a grilled tortilla topped with melted cheese ,grilled chicken, tomato and avocado, served with rice and beans (see pics) 

Wow! A perfect light lunch that I didn't feel guilty eating, it was so good! 

I have to give 4 stars based on my experience today, I will go back and hopefully thing will be as good next time too.
