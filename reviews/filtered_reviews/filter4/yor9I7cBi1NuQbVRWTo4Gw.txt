With an Irish Mexican name like Carlos O'Brien's, you really never know what you are getting yourself into.  After trying to find some good queso in the Valley with very little success, I finally found the good stuff at Carlos O'Brien's.  It was delicious.  Apparently queso is not a big thing in the Southwest, but us Texans live for it.  

The food and chips and salsa were also very good.  My fajita chicken quesadillas had cheese oozing out of the sides of the tortillas and big fresh peppers.  The margaritas were also quite tasty.  I was so full I felt like I needed my husband to roll me out the door.
