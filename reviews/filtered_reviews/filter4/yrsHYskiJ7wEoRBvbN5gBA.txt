This is the newest location of this great family-owned authentic mexican restaurant. It starts with  Outdoor seating, fabulous decor and a great bar. The lunch specials are great 32 to choose from. Personally I always like the Steak Picada or a la Mexicana. I don't know how they do it but I literally cut this steak with a fork. It was the most flavorful & tender steak I've ever had at a mexican diner. The tacos are crispy with shredded beef. By some stroke of magic the taco topping are still cool instead of all hot & wilted like other places. The service here is better than most any place you will ever visit. They take pride in their work and they want to make sure everything is to your liking. The menu is very extensive and reasonably priced and the servers are very good at describing all the dishes for you. If this place was in my neighborhood, I'd work a deal to wash the dishes for a free meal every day. Hats off!!
