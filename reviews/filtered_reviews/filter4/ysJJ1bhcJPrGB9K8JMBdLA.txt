This review is based solely on their $1 Taco Tuesdays and $1 Taco Sundays.

A word of advice: if you're getting $1 tacos on a Tuesday evening, show up early! This place fills up fast and if you've got a big group expect a wait of at least 25 minutes.

Despite the sometimes hectic atmosphere on Tuesdays, the servers are patient, friendly and always smiling. They do their best to stay on top of drinks and refilling the chips and salsa (which are free and never-ending!).

Their veggie tacos are the best I've had in Charlotte! They are filled with saut√©ed mushrooms, roasted corn, sweet plantains, and grilled zucchini... such GREAT flavor! Usually when you order a vegetarian taco, you can't expect more than just some random veggies slapped into a taco shell, but you can tell they actually gave thought to the flavor profile of this dish.

Thanks to the tasty food and the great deals, I am here twice a week. I love Loco Lime!
