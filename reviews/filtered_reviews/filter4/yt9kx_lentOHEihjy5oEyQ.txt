Have been wanting to go to Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken's restaurant since being awed by their performances on Top Chef Masters.  I was not disappointed.  
To start off, the staff were lovely - attentive, humorous, engaging and very helpful.  The decor is inviting and vibrant, setting the tone just right for a fun night.
Yeah, it's just Mexican food, but it's fricking delicious Mexican food.  To start, would recommend the appetizer sampler - the most amazing corn tamale ever along with other succulent delectations.  I also recommend the braised short ribs - some of the best short ribs I've ever had, and believe me when I say, I've eaten a whole bunch.  My wife had the special which was a seafood chile relleno which was a little heavy on the carrot salad and sauces, and a little light on the crab.
All in all, worth the trip down the strip.
