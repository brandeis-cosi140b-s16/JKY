I love the BBQ pork sandwich. The portions of mine and my company were big for the  price. The bean dip IS amazing. The service was prompt and on top of it from beginning to the end. The place is well-decorated and spacious. Lunch hour wasn't too busy or noisy. And there's a bar area which is a plus for a gamer like me ;)
