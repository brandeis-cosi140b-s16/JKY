I hate to give a place 5 stars on the first visit - especially since we sat outside and I didn't see ANY of the interior.

Went to lunch on Sunday with a girlfriend and LOVED my Southwest Pasta. The waiter was super nice and kinda funny. I asked if he had Dox XX's Lager on draft and he said that it was only in a bottle but he'd be happy to pour it into a frosted glass and we could pretend it was a draft - then at each table visit he asked me how my draft beer was (bonus points, IMHO).

My girlfriend had something with Salmon in it (Salmon Tacos? - sorry , shame on e for not writing my review on the day of our visit). She said hers was very good to.

Bummer for her, she used to live nearby and only stopped by after work for Happy Hour and nachos. She no longer lives nearby and was kind of bumming when she realized how good it was.

Lots of great entrees on the menu. Can't wait to take my husband back and give it another try - although it will have to wait until after he's off his carb-free diet.

(I noticed the review asked me about music, there was none outside and since it was football Sunday I'm going to assume none inside.... no idea if there's music any other time. Hope not, I'm not a fan. Can't have a conversation with your friends when there's music)
