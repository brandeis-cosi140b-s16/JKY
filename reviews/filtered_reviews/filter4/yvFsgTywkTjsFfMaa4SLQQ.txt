Service - we were a bit surprised that we were told they didn't have enough glasses for our party of 14.
They did end up rounding enough up.
Drinks were good 
We got one of each of the appetizers.
All the appetizers were great.
I'm a detail person and was a bit put off by the not having enough glass comment and having to walk throughout the place to get silverware and plates
