I can usually tell the quality of a Mexican restaurant by their chips and salsa and they did not disappoint here! On a rainy Tuesday for lunch, seating was a little limited as the patio is not covered but my party of seven sat at the bar and received good service. The shrimp tacos as well as the beans and rice were amazingly unique as well as the guacamole and queso dip. Looking forward to exploring their additional menu offerings...
