This is my favorite Roberto's location in all of Las Vegas.  I've tried many.  Breakfast burritos are the best because their cooks know how to cook eggs.  Some locations overstir the scrambled eggs.  The salsa bar is always clean, which is not always the case at many of the Robertos locations.  It's hard to put a finger on it, but this location seems to have the best tasting food.  The burritos are full.  There is enough cheese.  Also handy is the fact that they have a drive thru.  My only criticism is the dining room is in need of a remodel.  Other than that the place is top notch.
