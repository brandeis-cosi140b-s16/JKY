We have never been able to find good Mexican food when visiting Las Vegas until we visited Viva Mercados.  Wonderful service, the best Chile Rellenos ever and the Fish Tacos are to die for.  Oh yeah the Margaritas are wonderful too!  Give it a try you wont be disappointed.  Don't drive... Take a cab as you will be enjoying more than one of their Margaritas!

Viva Las Vegas...Viva Mercados!
