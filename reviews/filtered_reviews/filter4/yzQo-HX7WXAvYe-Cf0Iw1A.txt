Fun place to grab some drinks that is fairly reasonably priced.  Usually we go with a group and although we are loud, we always try to be courteous and ensure our waiter/ess aren't too annoyed with us.  The couple times we have been here it has been the same and the service was good and I say good because during happy hour how often do you want someone to come by? Once they saw our drinks low, they would ask us, basically what you want in a HH service.
