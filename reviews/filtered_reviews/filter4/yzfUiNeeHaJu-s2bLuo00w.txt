Excellent, fresh Mexican cuisine at reasonable prices, especially during happy hour. Their guacamole is chunky, fresh, and original, with pieces of orange in it that add a nice, unexpected citrus sweetness...probably second best in the city to only Barrio Cafe. The chicharron de queso is unique, and the dipping sauce is outrageously good, but be sure to share it with a couple other people unless you can eat a lot of crispy fried cheese cracker yourself. Tacos are all very tasty - the carne asada is a must, marinated so that it's tender, juicy, and slightly sweet. The casual atmosphere and friendly service round this place out as pretty darn good.
