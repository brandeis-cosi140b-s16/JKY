We stopped in for Happy Hour. This restaurant is simply amazing. The center bar is the showcase which provides you a feeling of being both indoors and outdoors. The service staff at all levels were extremely attentive. We had an assortment of tacos. Great presentation and flavor. This is a cool place to go. Highly recommended.
