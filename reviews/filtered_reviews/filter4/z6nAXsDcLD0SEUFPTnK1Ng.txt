This place was great. We were seated quickly. The chips and salsa were delicious. My wife raved about the tomatillo chicken enchiladas. I had the shredded beef tacos (my serving size was small, but after all the chips I had, that was probably a benefit.) The tacos were delicious. Everything tasted good and the margarita was well done as well. This is mexican food that will not disappoint.
