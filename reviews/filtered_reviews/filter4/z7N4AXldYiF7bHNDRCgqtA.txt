I found this place on Yelp when I typed in "Mexican Food" when we got into Scottsdale after our flight from KC.  

To start - the margaritas were quite good! The BF ordered the Cadillac and I had the skinny margarita but added strawberries to it.  Both were delish.

We started with the chorizo cheese crisp and it was HUGE. So good though! I had a carne asada taco along with a side of rice for dinner and the BF had the pork tacos. We loved everything.

It was a little pricey but I guess that's what you get for having 3 margs on your bill! We'd come back though!
