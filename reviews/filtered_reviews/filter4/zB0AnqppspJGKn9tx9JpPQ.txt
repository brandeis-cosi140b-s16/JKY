Okay. I found my fish tacos!! Well. Fish burrito at this visit. I missed the fish tacos from Taco Ayoteca. But it was brought back here, only with shredded cheese... Which was odd but okay, it was delicious and huge! 

I ordered two pastor tacos as well. Those were delicious! Not your standard pastor street tacos, but yummy! Meat was saucy and tender. Green garnish on top, papaya? But all the same, it was good. 

Everyone was nice and patient with me. Didn't feel rushed well standing there deciding. The decor was awesome! Everything new. I liked that they basically left me alone once my food arrived.

No one else came in while I was there. Even so, the employees were detail cleaning which I like to see when I used to work fast food. Can't wait to go back an need try the bacon and 50/50 taco. Not your typical Mexican street tacos, but delicious all the same!
