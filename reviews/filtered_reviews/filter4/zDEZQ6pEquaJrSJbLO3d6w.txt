Chipotle's Cool Hawaiian Cousin

Following a proven formula, Braddah's expands upon the Chipotle model with distinctive flavors, canned guava juices and wheat tortillas. I enjoyed the chicken and fish tacos, but there are plenty of other options as well. You can do a bowl, burrito or three tacos and apparently the dessert option of coconut bark is not to be missed.

Friendly staff set a positive tone up front, but I have to admit that the fact that you just leave your tray and plates at your table seemed out of place, but was a nice enough touch. If I lived in Vegas, this would be a stand-by for a quick lunch or easy dinner!
