I frequent this place a lot.  Its a great Mexican restaurant in the middle of Old Town, where there is a daily happy hour deal.  I'm not a fan of tequila, but if you are, this place is a must visit.  They have it all...

As for the food, I enjoy the fish tacos, as well as the baja lobster tacos.  Absolutely delicious!  I always tell myself I'm just getting 2 tacos, but end up getting 3 or sometimes, even four!  The guacamole is pretty good here as well. It always seems to sneak its way on our table as well.  

As for the service:  My fiance and I come here a lot, so we've had our share of good and bad servers.  Some are very friendly and are more than happy to please you, however, we've had a server or two who never checks up on you and takes 20 minutes to bring a beer even when its not busy.  Service is kind of hit-or-miss, but the food definitely makes up for it, and the prices are more than fair.

We've even used Cien Agaves to cater for a baby shower.  They allowed us to rent out the upstairs area.  It was out of the way and private, and the food was very satisfying.  They did a great job.
