Grey Power Lunch at the Carlsbad.  No Power but lots of Grey for three retired Motorolans who once globe trotted over Europe on Motorola's nickel (Deutsche Mark).  Dos XX's Draft, spinach salads and chicken quesadillas were not in the same ball park as some of the fancy meals in Zurich or Toulouse but the weather was pleasant on the patio.  The water fountains conveniently  drowned out other conversations so we could discuss the pre dot com days and higher MOT stock prices.  A good place to meet every so often plus good food.
