Came here for the fabulous Molly T's birthday lunch. I loved the look of the place. The huge hanging rope curtains around the bar, the wood carved wall in the back. Very sexy!

We started at the bar. We knew that they dont separate bills so we had to bring cash, but they also do that at the bar. No splitting! Everyone, except me, ordered margaritas, and everyone seemed to enjoy them. 

We had a reservation so we were seated once we had everyone in our party there. The menu was nice, lots of different offerings.

Me and my friend ordered the seafood cocktail to start (shrimp, octopus and a delicious dressing....very tasty!), we also had a cesar salad (ok, nothing special), and our entree was recommended by the bartender. It was a 3 in 1. A lobster enchilada, a shrimp taco and a poblano pepper stuffed with crab and shrimp. Sadly, the lobster enchilada was eh as was the poblano pepper, however, the shrimp taco was FANTASTIC. Absolutely devine. I loved that the best of every single thing I tasted. The flavors were amazing. Wish we would have gotten that only. So so SOOOOOO good.

For dessert, the brought out a flan for Molly with a candle and we sung happy birthday. I wasn't impressed with the flan myself, but others did seem to enjoy.

I'd love to go back and try one of the margaritas that looked delish, and I will definitely get those shrimp tacos. They were GOOOOOOOOOOD!
