SBC VEGAS SERIES:14 of many reviews
Slowing down with the boys!

So a night to ourselves and we really don't know what to do with ourselves.  Hmmmmmmmmm why don't we walk around to see what we can find. 

Low and behold we find this spot that I know i've been to in years past.  And if my memory serves me well, there should be some sangria here. Bear in mind this place closes relatively early on a Sunday... well what do you expect on a Sunday?? It is still nice as I recall overlooking the canals and a great spot to people watch if there were still people walking around. 

Let me tell you this... your favored three SBC bros. did not let you down. We drank our asses off on sangria in the last hour that place was open. Everything, from discussions of where to go next, to inside politics, to the cute girl that walked on by took on a very alcoholic slant that induced laughter till the wee hours of the morning. I love sangria. 

And that is basically how our night started on our last night on the strip.... the beginning of the end of SBC in Las Vegas trip. 
;D
