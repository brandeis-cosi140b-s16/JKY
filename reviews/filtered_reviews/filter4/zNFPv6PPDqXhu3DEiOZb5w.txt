Met up with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday and we had a great time! Our waiter was friendly and fun--even buying birthday boy a shot of tequila! Gotta love that! Food was enjoyable though not anything you haven't had before but it was satisfying enough and the drinks were kept full. Can't beat that! The mariachi band was EXCELLENT and a lot of fun. It's a little pricey but then, what isn't on the strip anymore?
