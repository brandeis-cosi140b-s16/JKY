Tacos and corn and horchata oh my! Seriously some of the best tacos I've had in Vegas. From traditional tacos like lengua to the more mellow kinds for those of us who aren't that adventurous like asada. Extremely friendly staff who's definitely willing to let you taste test if you just aren't sure. Sometime there's a little slacking when it comes to refilling the drink machines or the salsa bar but overall everything seems in order.
