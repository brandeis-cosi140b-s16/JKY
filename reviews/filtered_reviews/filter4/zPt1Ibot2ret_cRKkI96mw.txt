The staff was super attentive. Food was yummy...more tex-mex like. The view was awesome! You could see the whole valley. I went for lunch with my family and it was pretty quiet compared to the weekend (according to my Mom), but it was a Wednesday afternoon and we were looking for something good! It really seems like it would be a fun nighttime bar/food spot....I'll definitely visit when I'm in town again! BTW the margaritas looked awesome....alas I didn't try one.
