Yet another great local Mexican Restaurant. The food was great, the waiter was friendly. Only reason I dinged them a star was because it took about 5 minutes to refill my water on a slow afternoon.

I had  the combo with the Pork Burrito with Guacamole, a Chicken Taco, and a Cheese Enchilada. The Pork Burrito was my favorite, although the guacamole a bit odd as it was not a sauce rather whole bits of avacado with lime on it. Honestly, made it taste better in my opinion, complemented the pork extremely well.

Additionally, the chicken taco and cheese enchilada were extremely well made, although largely unremarkable for any particular unique qualities. Chips and salsa before the meal were also great, although the bean dip is only okay. Overall, great food to be had here!
