A couple of friends had recommended this place, so we finally gave it a shot.  The prices on the menu kind of punched me in the face - because it was hard to believe that anyone gets away with charging that for Mexican fare.  I ordered the enchilada trio, which was immediately forgettable.  The chips and salsa were just okay, and te waitress did a so-so job.  

The fun began once we were lured to the bar with the "Three Amigos" promo drink (after the meal).  

Basically, it's their house margarita, with a Coronita tipped in from above, and a Hornitos tequila sidecar.  This kind of got my night started on the right foot.  A few more of the house 'ritas once reverse happy hour hit, and we were finally happy.

In other words, no reason to go there for the food - but the bartender is great and the beer flows like wine.
