I am so happy that this is in Container Park! To start things off, the menu was hilarious. They have a chalk board menu that was split between their regular menu and the "Gringo" menu. That one included chimichangas, tacos that had lettuce, sour cream, etc. 
I had elotes, two tacos, and some chips and salsa.
The chips that they used were delicious! You can tell their tortillas are homemade. The tortillas for my tacos were also homemade, delicious, and held up really well to the taco meat. I ordered the al pastor and Adobada. The Adobada wasn't very flavorful--I felt that it needed some type of sauce. The al pastor was delicious! Loved the flavors. 
The elotes were, of course, to die for. A must try!
