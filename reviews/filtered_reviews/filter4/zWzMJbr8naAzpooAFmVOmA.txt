Good fix for my new mexico style flat enchilada's with an egg on top. Ordered the red with a side of the green sauce to test them both out- both were delicious. The chips are really good but the salsa is really watery, watch out the margaritas are strong! overall very nice, its small and gets packed, dont show up too late for dinner and it can be a bit warm in the small seating area.
