We're new to Scottsdale and have had difficulty finding mexican food that tastes authentic and isn't americanized-bland.

I found Habanero's on Yelp, we tried it, and concur with the many positive reviews that this restaurant (and the one up near Airpark/Scottsdale) have received.  Very good Mexican food!  

The restaurant is definitely fast-food oriented (rather than sit down and be waited on) and while we would prefer sit down and be waited on, we will gladly order at the counter to get good Mexican food.

The food isn't bland and a little more zip can be added with some auxiliary spicy hot sauce.  

We will definitely return to this place!
