A friend showed me this place. Just far enough from the craziness on Central to not be crowded but still has the same vibes. Love their cocktails and their fish tacos are quite tasty. Also have a great carne asada burrito. Solid guac. The servers were very helpful. I will be going back very soon. Love that this restaurant is going to be a part of the development of Central Phoenix's restaurant scene.
