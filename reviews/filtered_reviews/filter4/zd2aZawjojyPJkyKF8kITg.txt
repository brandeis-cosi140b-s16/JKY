We went with friends for a pre-theater dinner.  Friends were late but the staff was really friendly and accommodating while we waited for our friends.  The guacamole is chunky and well seasoned; the salsa is smoky and not too hot.  The seafood enchiladas were great as was the posole.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because our reservation was for 5:30 pm but they had us in the computer for 7 pm.
