Very good Mexican food! My boyfriend and I stopped in last Saturday, we sat in the bar and our service was GREAT! We ordered margaritas to start, and enjoyed chips and salsa.... I ordered a cheese enchilada and a chicken taco, my food was delicious! I would definitely recommend Macayo's.... I don't think you will be disappointed!
