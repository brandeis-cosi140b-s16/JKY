Yummy Margarita, interesting fried calamari, and fabulous blackened fish tacos!

We decided we wanted Mexican Thursday night and found out within a walking distance of the Convention center you have about 3 choices for dinner.
The one closest was indicated as herendous, so we immediately skipped it. One of the "ambassadors" suggested this place and said the carnitas were fabulous.

We arrived right about 6pm and had no trouble getting seated outside. Our waitress was really friendly and happy.
I started with a house margarita (rocks, salt of course) and it came in a shaker that help pretty much the equivalent of 2!!  Hence the limit to 2 to a person! 
Very tasty! I didn't think it was very strong till i got up and started to walk around!

The chips and salsa were interesting. There were 2 different type of chips - some puffy with a bit of sweetness, some regular. Definitely tasty. And the salsa was good!

We started with corn encrusted calamari - very interesting and yummy! I did the blackened fish tacos, hubby went with the steak and blue cheese quesadilla.
The fish was amazing! Make sure you get extra salsa! The quesadilla was weird - not something we would get again.
