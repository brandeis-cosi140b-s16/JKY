Move over Chipotle, you just got burrito slapped by Cafe Rio. I can't think of one item on my plate that could be outdone by another fastish food Mexican restaurant. The tortilla was so fresh and I am still dreaming about it. The shredded chicken was my favorite while my boyfriend swears by the shredded pork. The creamy  tomatillo salad dressing was full of flavor, but the vinegarette was equally divine. This is a great place for Mexican food without having to sit and wait. However the lines can be really long during lunch and dinner hours so you can call ahead. Also, if you are taking your salad To-Go consider getting your tortilla on the side so it doesn't  get soggy on the ride home.
