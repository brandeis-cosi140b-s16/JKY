I love Lindo! I actually enjoy this location as well as the one on Flamingo/215 and the other on DI/Pecos area. 
This one has a view of the city to die for! The food is always fresh and delish! The table side quacamole is expensive, but so worth it. I love that this place offers free bean dip with the salsa too! 
The only complaint I have is that it is always so freakin loud in here. The place is very open with high ceiling and it makes for the worst place to have any sort of dinner conversation. Good thing I am married and am more into the food at this point, because this would be a horrible date place :p
