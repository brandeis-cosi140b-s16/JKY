After Don Jose's on 36th Street and Thomas closed, I spent a year at home in tears, venturing out to eat mexican food very rarely, and then a friend of a friend turned me on to Via.  This has been my saving grace, and the variety on their menu makes it easy to take even the pickiest of my friends.  Being a fairly routine person myself, I regularly enjoy their mexican pizza, but have also tried and enjoyed their chalupas, tostadas, burros and enchiladas.  It's difficult to get a seat in here on a Friday or Saturday night, but I'm usually there in the early evening on a Friday for a much needed (and very affordable!) margarita!  Definitely a great little hole on the wall place!
