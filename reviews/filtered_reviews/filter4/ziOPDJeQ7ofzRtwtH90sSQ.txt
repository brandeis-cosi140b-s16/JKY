Tacos - adobada/pastor, asada, lengua, grilled onions & peppers.

We saw this place while walking down the strip and there was a big crowd so we had to try them out. The lines moves very quickly, so don't be turned off by them. We were at the front of the line before we even decided what we were getting. The food was ready immediately. I saw the person next to me order the grilled onions & peppers, so I asked for them and was surprised to find out they were free. I wish they had that on the menu because I wouldn't have known if I hadn't seen someone else ask for them. We got our tacos with everything on them and the sauces were perfect.

I really liked that they told us we could bring our beers in here. So, we sat in their outdoor tent with our tacos & beer!

Fast, affordable, convenient, authentic, and delicious, love it!
