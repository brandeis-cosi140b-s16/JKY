review from dicks hideway:
This place is called many things from Rokerij(y), Richardsons, and Dick's Hideaway. We went and grabbed breakfast and it was ok but pretty pricey for what we got. I was not a fan of the filet mignon breakfast or the way they do the beans on the tortillas but it was an ok experience. The next time we decided to try it for an early dinner but then decided to sit at the bar since happy hour is 5$ for appetizers(small plates). This is where the place really shines. The onion rings are the best I have had, The filet mignon skewers were excellent. The bacon wrapped shrimp were good but nothing to write about, but the prime ribsliders were top notch. We left with a small bill after a few drinks and some good food and vowed to go with friends again soon.

Go at happy hour and sample some small plates.
