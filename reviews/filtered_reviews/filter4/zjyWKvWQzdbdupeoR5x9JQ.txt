This place was great fun. It's in a hot location in the airport, so it was really busy - and fun to meet other travelers. I met SEVERAL people sitting here for about an hour - and they were super fun and made my layover a million times better than so so many more before it. The food was pretty average (mushroom tacos). The service was GREAT. The beer list and wine list were average. The atmosphere was beyond fun. So, to me, it was one of the best places I have been during a layover. I actually feel like it makes me want to fly through Phoenix - just so I can go to this place. I'm sure that there are slower times when this place isn't as fun, and that the fact that the food and booze is average is a little more apparent. But if it's busy, then it's fun. And fun is the name of the game in life - this place has it.
