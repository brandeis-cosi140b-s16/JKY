I may be mistaken but I think these are the same people that used to own Cantina  1511 before they jacked up the prices and the quality went downhill.
Regardless, I really like this place. It is in a great location tucked behind South Park Mall so people from all areas south of 277 can get to it with ease.
I don't really tend to notice ambiance unless it is for a date or there is something special. However, there is something (which I can't put my finger on) that personally put me at ease here.
The food is mid-range priced Tex-Mex but high quality taste. Even the chips are noticibly better than other Tex-Mex restaurants. The complimentary salsa has a bit more kick than most. It is tasty but be forewarned.
I tend to always end up gravitating to the tacos and depending on appetite, and how many free chips I've consumed, I can order two or three (I can always take home that third).
They have some pretty unique taco options and what is great is that you can mix and match. I have not tried a bad one yet. Although I am still working my way down the menu ;-)
Also, if you are here with your friends, be festive and grab one of their signature margaritas. They are delicious!
