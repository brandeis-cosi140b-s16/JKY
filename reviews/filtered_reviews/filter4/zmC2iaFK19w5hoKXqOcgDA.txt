If I could have the best of both worlds, it would be to have Bonito Michoacan move into Lindo Michoacan, so I could have the best Michoacan food in the best setting.  The views from the dining area are stunning.  Lindo really needs to open up a covered outdoor area...to experience the view while being outdoors would be like icing on the cake.  The food at Lindo isn't bad...it's just not as good as Bonito on Decatur.  Once you have Bonito's food, you'll understand.  If you've never had Bonito, and love Lindo, don't go to Bonito...just remain blissfully unaware and enjoy Lindo's stunning views.  I haven't had any of the alcoholic drinks there, but know people who have and they swear by them.  This is a very friendly, great service establishment.
