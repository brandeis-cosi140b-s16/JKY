One of the best burgers I've had in a long time, if ever. I got one with cheese, grilled onions and bacon - it comes standard with pickles and tomato but I went without. The grilled onions were perfectly cooked, it had plenty of cheese with a tasty "Stand sauce" (a type of thousand island sauce), and the bacon was a revelation - something about Niman Ranch? So very good.
An order of fries is definitely more than one person should eat. While I prefer thicker cut fries, kudos for keeping the skin on and seasoning them with more than just salt. Also order a side of the Stand sauce with them! There's only ketchup at the tables.

The inside seemed a little weird with how austere it was. Definitely not what I expected. They have an air-cooled patio, though!

I really wanted a shake (they have a lot of tasty-sounding flavours) but seemed a bit pricey at just under $5 for a 20oz. Maybe next time...

Overall, definitely would come back (must try the rib taco!) but remember to share a single order of fries instead of ordering your own and save a little cash for a shake. Very nice local business I hope sticks around!
