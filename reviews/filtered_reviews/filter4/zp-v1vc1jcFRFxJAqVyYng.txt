I liked this place. They are very fast and the food is fresh. I enjoyed watching the lady making the tortillas. We ordered nachos and 2 cheese enchiladas. They were both very good. The atmosphere is fun and chill. Something that did make me sick a little bit was that they didn't have soap in the bathroom and I was wondering if employees use the same bathroom..... iickkkk
