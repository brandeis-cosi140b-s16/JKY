I've been to Vida multiple times and seen all iterations of service here. Lunch, dinner, brunch, special events, during the DNC. It's a prime location in the EpiCentre with a killer patio and great mezzanine. Here's the breakdown:

Bar - Two. Upstairs and downstairs. Both have relatively the same offerings. Bartenders are friendly and attentive and make up a mean margarita. Most recently, we had some killer margaritas with Cointreau Noir -- much better than standard Grand Marnier. They have a decent selection of beers, but they stick to the Mexican food-centric bottles/draughts. 

Food - Incredible guac. Let me rephrase that -- I'd eat a whole meal of guac and chips and be a happy camper. I've never had anything from Vida that I wouldn't get again. I will say that my favorite time to dine is now brunch on Sunday. Try the chilequiles and thank me later. *drops mic*

Only downside that I can really comment on is the unassociated parking situation for the EpiCentre. "Yeah, yeah, yeah....WE KNOW, Ben," they exclaimed and clamored exhaustively. We all know it. We all hate it. It's expensive, validated parking isn't the norm, and so on. Just buck up and pay the piper. It's worth the meal. OR, find a spot on the street post 6pm or on the weekends when it's free as well.

Vida, thanks...for everything. I can haz guacamole?
