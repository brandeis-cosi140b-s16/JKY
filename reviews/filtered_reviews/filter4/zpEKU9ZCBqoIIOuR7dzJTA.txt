Our first time here after a long but great day at the ball park.  A little bit of a wait since the patio was closed for a private party.  Totally worth the wait.  We were seated in the bar area and were warned it would be tight.  Chips and not-salsa-but sauce were darn good.  Margaritas awfully tasty.  He had the #5 3 shredded beef enchiladas and I had the #26 3 fish enchiladas. Very, very good.  We liked it not just for what it is but also because of what it isn't.  Is great food with authentic taste; isn't food slathered in sauce & cheese.
