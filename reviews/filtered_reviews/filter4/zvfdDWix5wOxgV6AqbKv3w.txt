Fabulous little gem attached to the Crescent Ballroom. A casual, upbeat restaurant with American and Mexican fare. Not your run of the mill offerings, though. Cocina 10 puts its own spin on favorites and we haven't been disappointed. I highly recommend the blackened salmon salad. It's a source of culinary comfort to me. The seasoning is perfect. The veggies are crisp. Mango! Houston, we have mango. DH is working through the menu and has already been delighted by the Lolo Burger and Street Tacos.
The desserts struggle. There is chocolate bark, rice pudding, and mini churros. I would like to see one large piece of cake for sharing. That is my only complaint. 
One of the best things about this place is the people who frequent it. A very diverse, pleasant crowd.
