Yum!!

I love running to this place for lunch. Two Hippies Beach House is one of many treasures unique to Central Phoenix. This restaurant is easy to miss as you drive by on Camelback but you will never forget how lovely the atmosphere is once you stop in. The place is very well decorated in a unique fashion that supports the theme of the restaurant. The prices are cheap and the food is great! This place really can make a mean quesadilla. I love the quesadillas here because they offer a wide variety of toppings and meats. My favorite topping is the cabbage. Cabbage on a quesadilla?!?! Yep! It's fantastic! You gotta try it.

Two Hippies is a must!
