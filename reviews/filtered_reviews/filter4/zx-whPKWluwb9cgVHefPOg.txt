Oh I really liked it!  so expensive of course thats why it looses one star.  But the staff is super cool and they really made the experience great.  I wish I could remember the one bartenders name, but he was so great and sooo friendly (it was the afternoon of the 22nd) Chris? Ugh I am so bad with names anyways- we had some great margaritas, and the nachos were SOOOOOOOO good.  I had to get them twice while I was there :).  Loved it!!
