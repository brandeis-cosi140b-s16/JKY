Fish tacos! 

Who doesn't like crispy deep fried tilapia and pico de gallo??  the sauce was tangy, creamy, and had a little spicy kick to it!   the beans and rice were also on point!  not bland or dry at all!

The complimentary chips and salsa were excellent as well!  The chips were freshly fried and the salsa verde was tangy sweet and savory, such an awesome combination!  the salsa roja however did not impress me as much and it was just smokey and salty

Service was OK, I would hope next time they would keep an eye on the water levels at the table.

usually i'm not a fan of mexican food but i gotta hand it to T&T! it was great food!
