Not sure if there was so much hype that my first experience was destined to be a disappointment, but I felt that my Baja burrito was okay.  Diced up medium grade yellowtail, spicy tuna, veggies, and other stuff in soy wrapper.  Decent value at $8 but it's really only a slightly fatter sushi roll.  I felt that the portion was on the small side.  I was hungry a couple hours after lunch.
