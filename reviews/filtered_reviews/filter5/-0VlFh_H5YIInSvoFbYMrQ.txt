One of my goals coming into Phoenix was to find a great, local Mexican or Latin-influenced place for lunch one day. Mission accomplished.

I got a two-taco combo with horchata. For one, I picked up the apparently legendary carne asada, and the other, barbacoa. The combo comes with a side of rice and beans. I even got guac on the side, and there was three more salsas coming with my meal. So maybe I did pay $12 for lunch, but... holy cow.

I knew I was in for a good time when I sampled the rice. It's wonderful with a bit of fresh cilantro and lime will do to a side dish. I turned my attention to the beans, and they were also not overlooked; what's the secret ingredient? Bacon fat? Salt pork? Whatever it is, I thoroughly enjoyed the beans.

The horchata I got with my meal was excellent! They use more cinnamon than I'm used to, but it wasn't hyper-sweet and was just what I needed on another 100 degree day.

The tacos were fresh, served with a lime, and perfect. I liked the barbacoa   since it had a nice flavor from the marinade, but the carne asada was the star of this meal; not overcooked, not bland, not rubbery, not any other slew of adjectives that come to mind when I think of bad beef. It was juicy, and bright, and meaty, and perfect.

The sauces were wonderfully complimentary and I found myself wishing that I had chips as an excuse to eat up all the sauce (including the grilled green pepper / onion/ chile sauce that turned into a four-alarm in my mouth).

I didn't get a chance to do dessert since I was filled to the brim with what I had already ordered. But I find myself really hoping I go back to try it.

I can't speak for authentic Mexican food places, since I haven't been to many (or to Mexico). But I can speak to the food served at Mesquite; it's a great bargain!
