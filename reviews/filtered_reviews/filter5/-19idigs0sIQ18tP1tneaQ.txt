Decided to check this out on a Saturday night during our recent trip to Vegas after reading good reviews about the food and the Rock n' Roll Mariachis. Ordered the Carne Asada plate and it was delicious! Chips were good and the Verde salsa is even better. Waitress was very attentive and the Rock n' Roll Mariachis were really entertaining- sang really good and were super nice socializing while taking song requests. Needless to say we were not disappointed and this has become a new favorite spot for us!
