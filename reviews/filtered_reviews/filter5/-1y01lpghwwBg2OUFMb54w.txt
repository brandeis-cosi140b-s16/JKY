I took the BF here for his first Taco Tuesday at Gallo.  After declaring the carne asada tacos best, I proceed to order only one carne and stupidly ordered a halibut and a shrimp.  #1 carne, #2 pork, #3 shrimp, #4 halibut.  After the carne, nothing else really matches up flavor wise.  The tacos are extremely small, street size, which makes me happy as I have a fondness for cute little things.  3 is perfect for me with an app and cocktails.  The guac, although small in portion size, is very good and I am a picky guac eater.  It has little bits of orange in it, which keeps me interested.  We also ordered the shrimp ceviche which is among the best I have ever had.  This will be a regular at my table from now on.  I would be remiss by leaving out the fact that the amazing salsa is served in squeezey bottles on the table, so I can pile my tacos and chips with the extra fantastical red sauce that I crave.  The last Tuesday I went, they had watermelon aqua fresca which I spiked with vodka and it was a little slice of heaven on a hot summer night.  The BF likes him some scotch and they had a brand to his liking.  We topped it off with the tres leches cake.  Omg.  Need I say more?
I have also had weekend brunch here which I don't remember having any specials, being in a hotel and all I'm sure they dont need to attract early eaters but they can do no wrong in my eyes so I will be back.
