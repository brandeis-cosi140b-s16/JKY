This place has the charm and authenticity of Los Sombrero's, but the prices and comfort of El Bravo. The ingredients were fresh and tasty, and the dishes themselves were traditional but oh-so perfectly original. 

The chips they brought to the table were still warm and obviously cooked in house. The salsa rested comfortably in the range of spicy but not too spicy and bursted with flavor. 

Mucho Gusto is perfect for the Mexican food purist or out-of-towner that has never experienced true south of the border flavor. It has been selected as Best of Phoenix by the New Times and after checking it out, it's clearly well deserved.
