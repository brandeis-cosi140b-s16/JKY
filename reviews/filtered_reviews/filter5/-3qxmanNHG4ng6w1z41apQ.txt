Gollo Burro, Machaca Taco, and Tostada, and make sure you order the "Extra Hot" Sauce!!!  If you don't like this place, you're not from around here, that's for sure.  It's definitely not for your average gringo.

This was the first restaurant that I ever went to as a child, and we kept going back because you can have screaming kids, and no one gets on your case about it.  This is truly a family restaurant beyond all family restaurants!  

Great atmosphere, great margaritas, great food.
