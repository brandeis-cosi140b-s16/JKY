What a marvelous find for late night dining near the Strip. The tacos were small, allowing one to try several, and flavorful with a well thought out mix of complementary ingredients.

The draft beer selection, while not exceptionally large offering about a dozen choices, was varied in style. Our exceptionally friendly and helpful server (?Kaycee) happily provided samples of the interesting choices. The margaritas were tremendous and were quite the bargain during the early and late happy hours at only $4.

P.S. and to all of the previous posters that recommened to get the pumpkin seeds added to the guacomole dip, you were all correct.
