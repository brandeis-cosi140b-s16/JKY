If you love Postinos, Federal and Windsor you with LOVE LOVE this place.  On our way to Postino's for lunch on Saturday we saw this huge crowd at a new place across the street and decided to try it.  Everything was delicious, especially the blood orange margarita and the service was great.  Definitely will be back!
