Hands down in my top 3 best Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas! For sure #2 and maybe even #1 once I try ALL entrees. The tacos and enchiladas are excellent. 

Bean dip before the dinner that comes is super tasty. I ordered two bowls of it.

Strawberry marguerites are fruity but stiff if you know what I mean. 

Customer service here is absolutely great. Couldn't of been taken care of any better.

VIVA viva mercados!!!!! Great place for parties and private event dinners!!!!
