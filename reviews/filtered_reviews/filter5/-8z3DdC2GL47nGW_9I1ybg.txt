Considering its location and clientele this place gets 5 stars.  The street taco, which was Pork El Pastor that evening, was as good or better as any that I could have gotten in the mission in San Francisco.  The Sopes appetizer was a surprising treat.  Only complaint is that it is a bit loud, but that's a minor complaint considering that it is Vegas
