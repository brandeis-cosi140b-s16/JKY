Ate there a few weeks ago... A little slow in my review. First- it's really cute. 2- Carlos was our server and he was awesome, I appreciate great service and I was not disappointed. Importantly- best salsa ever! 

The food is really good, I was really impressed. I had the taco and enchilada plate. I ate everything on my plate along with more chips and salsa than I probably should have... It's just that good. 

My new favorite Mexican restaurant!!!
