This reminds me of the place I grew up (and later, my kids) grew up eating Mexican food.  I was taught that tamales are the test of a good mexican restaurant, and  El Bravo's chicken green chile tamale is unbelievably good with lots of filling, great flavor, and light sweet masa. My husband and I are continually seeking out authentic, privately owned Mexican restaurants and El Bravo remains consistently great.  We recently took California friends to El Bravo. Both are Mexican, and the husband grew up in New Mexico. He was in heaven at El Bravo, and practically ordered 1/2 the menu as he wanted some to take home. He said he hadn't had mex food "this great" in a long time. I might mention we walked into the restaurant on a Monday night - not knowing they close early. They still gave us exceptional, friendly service. Now......if we could ONLY get a real margarita!
