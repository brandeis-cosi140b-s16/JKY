Superb! Great outdoor seating & inside... Menu was easy to understand. Yelp did great helping us find a good Mexican restaurant. It was packed when we got in & packed as we left. No waiting at all was seated right away.. The guys all worked together helping every table.. And their cook did an amazing job with our food! It was perfect! The food tasted very organic & fresh.. From their mixes of salad & their choices of meat.. It was all perfect! Gotta try their fish or shrimp tacos! My date had a beef burrito & that was slamin also! Many credits to their chef!
