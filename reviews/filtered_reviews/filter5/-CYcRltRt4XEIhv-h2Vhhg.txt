Best fish tacos in Phoenix! All the condiments you could ask for and they are all FREE! I recommend the regular fish taco and the machaca as well. You wouldn't expect it here, but you get some of the best fries you will ever taste (dip it in the chipotle southwest sauce for best results ;) ) TOTALLY recommend this place!
