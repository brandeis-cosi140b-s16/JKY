This place is awesome.  It's a little tough to get to due to how cave creek and 7th St merge but once you find it, it's a gem.  I always get the same thing, the nortena torta with chicken.  The Mexican sandwich is marinated grilled chicken with jalape√±o and onion tossed in. They then top it with Jack cheese, avocado and a chipotle cream sauce. It's incredible.  The bread is super soft and light.  My favorite item here is the orange salsa.  It's sweet with a little touch of heat, I could honestly drink the stuff.  I ate there with a buddy and we went through like 5 of the little dishes, it's insanely good.  My understanding is there authentic drinks are very good too but I haven't tried them personally. The service is always spot on.  This is one of the better sandwiches in Phoenix!
