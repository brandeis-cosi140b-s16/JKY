Tacos And Beer is awesome!

My husband and I have eaten here several times, and we love it more with each visit.

The atmosphere is great. The decor is really unique and inviting.

The staff is friendly, and helpful. The bartenders were very knowledgeable of their extensive beer menu. If you're a fan of great craft beer, Tacos and Beer is the place to go. They have an amazing selection of hard to find craft brews. Everything from imperial stouts for my husband, to wild sour beers, and even honey mead for me. The general manager, Dave, knows more about beer than anyone I've ever met. He was kind enough to introduce us to, what are now, several of our favorite beers!


And the food is absolutely delicious! Chips and guacamole are great. Oh and the beer cheese dip is ridiculous. We've tried most of the tacos and love them all. Our favorites are; the crunchy tacos with mash potatoes, the puerco verde with pork rinds, the beef adobada, and the pork al pastor. The flautas are also great! We have also eaten dessert there, and my goodness, the flan is amazing, definitely the best flan I've ever had. The churros are really great as well.

Overall, this is just a great restaurant in Las Vegas!
