It's all about the food.  

And the prices are great.  I get a #3 (chicken taco, tostada, cheese enchilada, rice and beans) and a beverage for just over $7.00.

There is no ambiance unless you count "non-ambiance" as ambiance.  You'll be eating out of a styrofoam tray and plastic utensils while sitting in an echoing room at tables that, after the perpetual daily lunch or supper rush, may or may not be clean. 

So how can this get 4.65 stars?  (I had to round up.)  It really is all about the food.  

And there IS free wi-fi so you can dine and surf.  :)
