We had our White Elephant for Couchsurfers and everybody left smiling with a silly/useful gift and happy tummies! 

This time I've tried the pork torta and again...good flavors and very similar to the taste you'll get on a real mexican torta. Everybody loved the guacamole and between sangria and margarita...go with Margarita!
