So happy to be a regular customer to Wahoo's again. Loved them in Orange County and I love them even more here in Las Vegas. Food is always fresh. I love that the fish is grilled and you get large pieces of fish instead of that fried beer batter crap like rubios. If you want to add some amazing flavor ASK FOR MR. LEE'S SAUCE!!!!

Every time we go in we are treated like family, Virginia and Candy are amazing behind the bar! Great beers on tap, Full bar....Gaming...cant ask for more!
