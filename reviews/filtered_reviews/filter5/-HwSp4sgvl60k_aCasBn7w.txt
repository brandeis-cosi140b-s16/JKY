Waaaaaa????
 3.5? no way! 
I don't even know where to begin. My mouth is getting watery while I write my review LOL. We weren't sure where to have dinner so we didn't make any reservations. Waited about 15min for a table but it was all good because we waited at the bar. Their specialty are mojitos. They must have every tequila in the world. 
Ok time to talk about the dinner.....I had the mole with grilled chicken. The sauce was good, obviously it was made from scratch. The guacamole was made from scratch. The salsa's for the chips was good, the tortilla soup was good. The dessert OMG awesome! Everyone else was satisfied with their meals too. Service was excellent and place is very nice with a nice romantic setting. What else do you want? 
 I really recommend this place, a bit pricy but well worth it!
