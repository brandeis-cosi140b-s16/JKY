Amazing experience. Enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere. If you want amazing food overlooking the great backdrop of beautiful Vegas hotels, CABO is the place.

The chips and salsa are a must. The quesadilla was so delicious and yummy. The carne asada tacos are so good.

Our waiter, Danny, was amazing, made our experience first time being at the place amazing with no hiccups or any problems. Kudos!!!!

Definite stop if your ever in the Las Vegas strip.
