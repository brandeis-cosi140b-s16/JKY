When the pickiest eater of my bunch clears her plate, you know it's good!!! Tucked away in a little strip mall, this very clean and comfortable spot feels like home, especially when Lulu herself comes out to speak with you while the rest of the family keeps on eating. Try the zopes, AZ burrito  (if you can take the heat of the fire sauce) and have some flan too! We'll be back...and I won't be waiting 10 years to come again.
