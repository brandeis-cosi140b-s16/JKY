This restaurant is one of my favorites!!! I'm so picky when it comes to Mexican restaurants! Extremely picky!!! My husband and I have been to a handful and while there's more places we've not yet tried around us, this place takes the cake so far! The food is so yummy! Portions are great! Nice drink specials and super service!! Reminds me of our favorite place back home!!! Everyone has to have their favorite Mexican Restaurant and for us..we finally found one here in Phoenix!
