This place is awesome! 

I'm always looking for a good burger and I don't have to look any further! I've passed this place several times and always wondered how good their food is. 

So what did I do? I Yelped it and found out it had some pretty great reviews. 

I went with my sister on Saturday. We pulled in to the parking lot and already it was getting pretty busy for just opening (11am). We walked in and it was pretty small, but hey, these kinds of places usually are. 

The menu is pretty limited when it comes to their burger. They have "The Standard". But when you make something right, why deviate from it? I got mine with jalapenos and we ordered some fries. 

It was busy, so the wait was a little longer than we expected but it was definitely worth it. 

The burger and fries are so fresh, hot and good! If I could just make one minor suggestion, it would be to toast the bun on the grill a little bit. I

Needless to say, I felt like a huge fatty after I left. I'd definitely come back again. I saw a woman eating some tacos. Maybe I'll try those next!
