I love it here. My stomach growls at the thought. The tacos, the salsa bar, the grocery. Can I move in? The produce is always so fresh, delicious and well priced. And the tacos...well...they're the best tacos you can find here in Pittsburgh. My personal favorite are the ground beef tacos but I don't think you can go wrong with any type at $2.50 a piece. Fill up your to go mitts with fresh pico, cilantro, guac and all of the delicious salsas that your body craves and you'll be set for hours. Remember, cash only at the taco stand, muy importante!
