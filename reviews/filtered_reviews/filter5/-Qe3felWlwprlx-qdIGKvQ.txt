Why is it so hard to find good Mexican food in Vegas?  I come from SoCal so I guess I'm spoiled.  Los Tacos is soooo good, it's worth the drive all the way from Henderson.  Tacos are great, burritos are great, carnitas is superb, love their watermelon drinks, and don't forget to get an extra large container of pico de gallo to take home.  The best ever!
