Business trip=loser, trying amazing restaurants while on a business trip=WINNER! This place was beyond outstanding! 

First this is not Mexican food, which I was glad about because really, I live next door to Costa Mexico (Mesa) so I don't need to fly to Arizona to eat Mexican. But I will fly to Arizona to have this amazing food from New Mexico! In fact I may move here to eat this food, this is how much I loved ever single bite.

I had a margarita and loved it. I ordered a plate that had the chili relleno, tamale, enchilada and rice and beans on it. I never, ever order chili rellenos but this woman next to us kept raving about it so I figured if I got it as part of a combo plate, I would not be stuck feeling sad I didn't order something else. My god I am so glad I listened to that big mouth customer; it was the best chili relleno I have ever had in my life.
I don't know what the boss ordered but whatever it was, I tried it and it was equally outstanding.

The boss and I tried to quit eating when we were full and we could not so we rolled out of the restaurant, down the tarmac and flew back home in our food comas and lived to tell about it...
