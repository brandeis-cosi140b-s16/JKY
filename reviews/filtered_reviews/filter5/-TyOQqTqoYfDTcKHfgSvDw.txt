We have been wanting to come here again for such a long time now.
It is one of my girlfriends best loved Mexican Food places. But, we never find ourselves out in this part of town too much.
We came in for an early dinner. about 4 :15.
We were greeted and seated in a great booth right away.
Chips and salsa are delish here no doubt.  The green and the red sause are amazing.
It is decorated very nicely.  Drinks were good. Teresa was given fresh coffe,(her absolute favorite with Mexican food.
She got the Crab enchiladas and I got the chicken enchiladas. AWESOME!
Good thing this is not too close to us,we would gain far too much.
lots of parking and nice clean restrooms as well.
Too bad it is so hot outside, because the patios are beautiful!
