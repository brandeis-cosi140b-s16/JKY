Tapas are phenomenal here! Defintely go during happy hour (every day 4-6pm) and sit at the bar. We've gone about 4 times now. It was recommended by my friend who's local here when I first moved, and I like taking whoever visits me here. 

We've only had small plates and I think I've liked all of them. My top faves are: shrimp scampi with dirty rice, blue crab tostada, beef tenderloin toasts, jumbo shrimp (or scallops) wrapped in bacon, and ahi. The ones that were ok were the ceviche, stuffed mushrooms, and sliders, probably bc I've better elsewhere.

Last time we went, the guy next to me ordered 3 portions of the bacon wrapped shrimp. That's a lot of bacon! But it's that good =)
