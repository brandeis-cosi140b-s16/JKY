First of all, I would just like to point out the fact that this place has not been open very long. Maybe a year or two, max. I remember it being a barbecue place, with that said, it has more reviews than other Mexican restaurants I was looking to take my husband to for his birthday. So, to me it says something that a place that hasn't been established long has so many great reviews. 
Service- everyone there is very friendly and go above and beyond. Example- we brought our 17 month old and after seating him a lady brought out a drawing game for him to play with, this ended up being a lifesaver!!!!! I also saw her bring one out for an older boy, as well as the standard coloring paper and crayon. Everything came out very fast and was a pleasant experience. 
Food- the chips, bean dip and salsa were good! They literally bring it to you as your seated! The sopa de fideo is so tasty even my picky toddler gobbled it up!! 
My husband and I both ordered a 3 item plate, chicken tacos, beef flautas, and cheese enchilada. The beef was shredded and moist and oh so tasty, I didn't make it to my taco, but it was generous in size and my husband said his was great. The enchilada comes with red or green sauce, which to me can make or break the enchilada. The green sauce was very good and so was the red. The portions are HUGE so expect leftovers. We ordered the churro, even though the server recommended the fried ice cream, now I wish I had gotten that. The churro wasn't really anything special. Not something is get again, bit hey, I don't typically have room for dessert at a Mexican place, so it doesn't knock off any stars in my book. 
The place has happy hour every day and it's not crowded at all...yet, although the way the reviews are going I'm sure it will get there.
