After reading the reviews in Yelp and a co-worker telling me about this place I have to say it was well worth the busy! The food was so good!!! This is the best Mexican food I've had in a long time! I had carne Asada enchiladas and my friend had the nachos along with Cadillac margaritas! I can't wait to come back and try some other entrees!!! Oh and customer service was amazing!
