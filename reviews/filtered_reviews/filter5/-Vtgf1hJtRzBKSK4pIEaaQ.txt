I've eaten here plenty of times, but being a creature of habit I usually order my favorites which are the fresh guac made at your table and fish tacos. Last night I decided to be adventurous and asked the server what he recommended, Camarones Mojo y Ajo. Seriously? It was outstanding! Jumbo shrimp, toasted garlic, asparagus, pico de gallo,
fresh lime, and veggie rice. Absolutely delish with my red sangria! Definitely my favorite spot in Charlotte for Mex-eating happiness.
