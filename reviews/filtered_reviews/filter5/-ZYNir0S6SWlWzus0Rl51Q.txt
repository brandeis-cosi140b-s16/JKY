I don't have much to add that hasn't already been said, but I wanted to throw my five stars in the pot.  I'm thrilled America's opened this second location!  I wasn't sure the service would be as friendly as it is at the other location, but it definitely is.  As expected, the new place is cool, decorated wonderfully, and is a great spot to visit with friends or swing by to pick up a quick order after work.  If I could throw an extra star to this location, I would.  Why?  I think the salsa is just a touch better, spicier, and more flavorful than it is at the 7th St. location.  Either way, I love this place!
