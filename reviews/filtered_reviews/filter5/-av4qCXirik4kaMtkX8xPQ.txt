I am from San Diego and was looking for a good brunch spot in Vegas.  This was it!  The food was phenomenal and the service was outstanding.  The chef even came out to say hello and see how we liked everything.  The chilaquiles was the best I have ever had and  I never saw the bottom of my mimosa glass!  Everything is fresh and Organic.  I love it!
