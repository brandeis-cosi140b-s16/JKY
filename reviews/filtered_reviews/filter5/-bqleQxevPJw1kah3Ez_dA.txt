Isabel's Amor is a spin-off of the local Some Burros chain. It's a more upscale dining experience, offering sit-down service.

The Asado Salad is delicious! 

The Chili Rojo de Pollo Burrito is very tasty. The chicken is quite juicy.

There is lots of natural lighting due to all the windows.

Upbeat music.

This place is fabulous and I recommend it to my friends.
