I travel for a living and have probably eaten at over a hundred Mexican restaurants AND I just got back from Mexico, yet Maize is seriously one of the top 5 Mexican restaurants I've been, maybe even top 3. Wow! 

There are 2 hot sauces served with chips, the red one is ok but the more yellow one is UNREAL. Delish! Very unique sauce!!!

Guacamole and chips: A+

They have real Mexican sodas like Jaritos and Coca Cola (made with cane sugar, not high fructose corn syrup as in the US recipe).

The tacos were the best! I'm sure the tortillas are hand made. Yum! 

There is very limited seating (less than 20 spots) so it's hard to get in but the wait is well worth it. 

Thanks for having such high standards,  Maize; we the (eating) people appreciate it!
