Absolutely love this place, their chips and salsa were fresh and tasty. The ceviche was fresh. Also tried the carnitas tacos and they were amazing! All of these items were on the happy hour menu so the bill was affordable.  Not to mention the house margaritas!!! Good place will def come back again. Lastly the bar tender Omar was super nice and attentive.
