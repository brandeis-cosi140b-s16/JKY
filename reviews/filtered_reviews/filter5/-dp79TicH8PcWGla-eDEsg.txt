Tiny hole-in-the-wall...two tables that can seat 2 people each, and then a small counter.  Most of the kitchen is right before your eyes--so you can see how they prepare the food.

The food here?  Absolutely top-notch.  Very fresh.  Muchisimo sabor!!!  The hot salsa here is so flavorful, I couldn't stop eating it even when my face was burning.  Lots of fresh avocado, onion, cilantro, everything was so good and balanced just right.
