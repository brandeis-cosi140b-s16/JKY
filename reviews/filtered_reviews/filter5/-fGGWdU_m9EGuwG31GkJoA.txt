Greatest happy hour ever!  Cheap beer and street tacos.  We did not get any of the specialty ones but it did not matter, everything was fresh and amazing.  They have the best mole in the Pheonix, we searched multiple spots and this one is special.  Salsa bar is crazy!  I am taking my family here when they arrive!
