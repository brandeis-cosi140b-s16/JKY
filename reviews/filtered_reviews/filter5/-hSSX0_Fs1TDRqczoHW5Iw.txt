One of THE BEST carne asada tacos I have ever had, hands down.  The juices and everything about this taco is worth every penny.  I usually get mines with no avocado, since most of the time they usually put a spoonful of avocado & i really dont need to taste that much avocado in one sitting.

Not only do i order the carne asada tacos, but also the carne asada fries. The carne asada fries can either come in half ($5) or a large order ($10). I ordered the half ordered and OHHH GEEZ it was pretty BIG! I couldnt even finish it, it was good but not THAT good. 

Needless to say, I could always come back to this taco eatery. Yumm yumm
