One of the best mexican restaurant in town. Their lemonade is absolutely out of this world--be sure to order a pitcher of it! And you drink pi√±a colada straight from a pineapple too! Very creative. I am always craving for their chile relleno. You will,for sure come back for more! Great place and atmosphere for family. Enjoy!
