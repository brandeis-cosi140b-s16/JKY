We went to Chuys last night for the the first time and we were extremely happy about our experience! After being let down over and over again from mediocre wanna be Mexican restaurants in the Charlotte area, we had little to no expecations for Chuys and man did this restaurant not disappoint! It was extremely busy when we got in. Put our name in for two, and was only expecting a 20-25 min wait. So we decided to go to the bar area and grab a drink. It was packed there as well but for some fortunate reason the bartender saw me standing there through the crowd and asked what drinks I wanted?! What! No way, most bars that busy, the bar tenders avoid eye contact with people standing. Surprisingly enough, while that kind bartender was making the drink order, another bar tender asked how she could help. Very great service right off the bat. Got a traditional lime margarita on the rocks and it tasted fresh and delicious. We then looked around the bar area and noticed some open tables. Asked if we could just sit there instead of waiting for our table, and there were no issues. As soon as we sat down, our server came up to us with two waters and talked to us about the menu. Very informative and gave us great recommendations. I ordered the chuychanga and it was delicious!! Would recommend the tomatillo sauce as it is a mix between verde salsa and white queso. Yum! My husband got the chika chika boom boom and the flavor was amazing! Both dishes we would recommend to anyone. Last but but not least, the chips and salsa were the best we've had in Charlotte. The salsa is a pico de gallo type salsa, extremely fresh tasting! They also brought out a jalape√±o cream salsa which was my husbands favorite. Definitely a must try bc it was very different! Careful though, chips and salsa are so good you will def get full just on those.

Chuys is a must try! It is now our go-to Mexican place in Charlotte!
