Great little restaurant. I've been here a few times and food has always been consistently good. This last time I went I had their Chile Verde plate which was delicious! Its pork in green salsa with a side of rice and beans. The salsa on the pork was speicy but had a grea taste almost as good as my moms! I also had an horchata drink which was also as good as my moms. Definitely will keep coming back also noticed that they deliver so will be doing that too!
