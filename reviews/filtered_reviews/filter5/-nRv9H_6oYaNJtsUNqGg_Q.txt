I literally dream of the enchilada dinner plate. Their spice game is on point, the owner, Drew, is absolutely the best and the bartender, Hector, is always friendly and awesome. Last time he recommended I try their sangria/margarita combo.. All I can say is yes, please and can I have another. 

This place will not disappoint!
