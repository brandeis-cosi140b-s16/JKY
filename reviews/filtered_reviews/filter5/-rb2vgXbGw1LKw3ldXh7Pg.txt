I'm reluctant to give away this treasured hide-away because it's one of my secret (that's obviously not a secret) places. The tacos are amazing!!! The is my official spot for years now. My friend Karen introduced me to this food truck (I usually don't do roach coaches...LOL) which is adjunct to Charlie's club on Camelback and 7th Ave. You'll meet a colorful cross selection of people from all over the valley. Some time the other customers are intoxicated beyond belief and act as such but, that doesn't take away from the good, fresh, flavorful food. There is not one thing that is bad on the menu and the prices are reasonable. Depending on how veracious your appetite, I'd start with 3 carne asada + 3 chicken tacos, fully dressed (double that is you can eat a lot).  The lines are long especially after 11pm and you may wait up to 10 minutes for your food but, it's well worth it. The music from Charlie's pipes through and is entertaining. My biggest complaint is the parking. They have only a few spots right there, or you have to park in Charlie's overly crowded parking lot because the city has put up new signs not allowing you to park in the nice sized adjacent lot (but they do all the time...thx Phoenix PD). Go check it out because they are there Thurs-Sun until 4am!
