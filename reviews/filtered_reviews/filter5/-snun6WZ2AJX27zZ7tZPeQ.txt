Very good food! I had the shrimp fajitas and the guacamole with crap as an appetizer, definitely recommend both! Our drinks and appetizer was brought out fast but the food took a little longer to come out but was worth the wait. The atmosphere was good and the place is well decorated with a choice to sit in or outside. Our waitress was very nice and the prices were very affordable. The best Mexican food we've had here in Vegas yet!
