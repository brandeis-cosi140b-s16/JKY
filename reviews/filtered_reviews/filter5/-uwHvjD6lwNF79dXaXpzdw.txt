Homestyle mexican food, ooey, gooey, cheesy deliciousness served up in a hole in the wall, what could be better?!! 
We finally gave this place a try after living here for 4 years & idk why it took us so long. 
I always order a chile relleno at every Mexican restaurant I try. That's my gage of how good their food is. Such a simple food but so easy to mess up. 
Not only was the amount of batter perfect, not too thick & had that airiness to it that it should, they clean up the pepper 1st. They remove all the seeds, ribs & stems! I've never seen that before & its such a small thing, but very appreciated when scarfing down all that cheesy fried chile goodness. The crowning glory tho is the optional sauce that they cover it in. Please get the sauce. It's amazing. Idk how else to describe it. I asked our waitress (who also happened to be the owner) what it was & she said it was just their enchilada sauce, secret family recipe of course! I've never had enchilada sauce like this. It has a richness to it that I've never tasted in any enchilada sauce that I've ever had before. 
We've been a few times now & every time it's been amazing. They claim to be known for their green chile which I've had & while it is pretty tasty, I think they should be known far & wide for that amazing enchilada sauce. Yum....
