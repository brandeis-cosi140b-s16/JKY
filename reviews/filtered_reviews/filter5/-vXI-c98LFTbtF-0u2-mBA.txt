We stayed at the Aria, and after reading the reviews, decided to go there for the boyfriends bday. Made reservations - was seated right on time- and let me tell you- it was DELICIOUS!!!! 

I had skirt steak tacos which were the ultimate. Steak was seasoned to perfection. Boyfriend had spinach enchiladas and couldn't stop talking about it. The guacamole is literally the best I have ever had. 

Nice, intimate, low lights, perfect ambiance for date night. Service was right on spot. 

Don't hesitate to go! 

Thanks Javier's!!
