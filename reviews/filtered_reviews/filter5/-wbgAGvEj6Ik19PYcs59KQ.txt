3 meals.  2 days.  All of them 5 stars.  We lucked out like crazy here.

1) Great chips and salsa (I hate salsa.  However, the smoky-flavored one with no chunks?  I ran a train on that bitch.)
2) Plaintain empanadas were good.  Not the best thing I've ever eaten, but I definitely would get them again.
3) Caesar salad with skirt steak:  excellent, excellent steak.  Cooked to perfection.  Salad could have used a bit more dressing but it was good, that nice Mexican spicier Caesar dressing.
4) Beef taquitos.... yeah, that was the shit squared.  The best taquitos we have ever eaten.  Period.  Phenomenal stuff.  Black beans served with were also good.  Green rice not so much.  But I don't like green rice anyway, so no harm done.
5) Friend's pork... nice cinnamon rub, excellent flavor.

We dug it highly.  Only real downside was the 50-cent water per person slammed on the table as soon as we sat down, and seeing the bit on the menu at the bottom in small print about being able to refuse it about 5 minutes later after we already drank.  Meh.  

But for food?  We are very glad we finally got to try it.  Thanks, Top Chef Masters, for the heads up.
