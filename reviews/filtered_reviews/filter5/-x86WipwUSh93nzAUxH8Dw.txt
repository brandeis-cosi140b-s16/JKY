Atkins and South Beach diets say eat more red meat if you want to be thin. 
Harvard Medical School says to eat more red meat if you want to be dead.

Implicitly, this means my new weight-loss goal should be somewhere between thin and dead, and since I tend to lean more toward thin, I'm going with dead. 

And here's how.
Someburros' crudo burrito, sans the tortilla.
Order a side of crudo for $3.25, and if Harvard is right, you'll be dead in no time, this despite it's deliciously marinated beef smothered in spicy tomatillo sauce.

Yes, if South Beach and Atkins are good weight loss programs, you'll be in that banana hammock in less than a month, grossing-out all the girls poolside.

Well fuck you Harvard Medical.
As if I'm going to listen to anything you say about red meat or any other fucking thing.
I'll bet you guys never even looked at my entrance application...did you? 
Do you know what a lousy lib arts degree from Phoenix College gets you? 
Can you say nada?

Or don't you waste your precious researcher's time studying relationships between rejected Harvard applicants and how fucked their lives eventually become?

Perhaps you should, because if you did, you'd know how my life is a steaming pile of dogshit, and how my eating red meat and dying is the least of my concerns at this point.


Arrghh
