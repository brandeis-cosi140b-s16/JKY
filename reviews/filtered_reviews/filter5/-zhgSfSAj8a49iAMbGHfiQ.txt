Mundo is one of those hidden restaurants. You will not find this place on the strip or anywhere near it. It's located in the Las Vegas Design Center at the World Market Center. My girlfriend and I always come here each time we visit Vegas. The food and service are always excellent. On Friday Nights they also have a live band. 

You start out your meal with some chips and a trio of salsas. Each one of them are excellent. Another enjoyable appetizer is the Queso Flameado. It is this amazing mix of 5 cheeses melted with mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, and a delicious chili sauce. You can enjoy this appetizer with the tortillas they provide, or the chips. I enjoyed it more with the chips, since it reminded me of an upscale version of nachos. 

One of my favorite entrees there is the short rib enchilladas. These enchiladas are soaked in a pasilla tomato sauce. The meat was so juicy and tender. There was no need for a knife. 

Then to end the meal, the Flan was memorable. It has a nice firm texture and the caramel was warm and sweet. it was a great way to end the meal.
