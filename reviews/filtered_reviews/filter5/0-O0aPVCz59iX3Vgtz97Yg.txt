Oh, wow.  Where to begin?  We saw this place on Cooking Channel's "Best in Chow."  My son and I were out and about and I decided to check the place out.  I always like to try the local eateries highlighted on TV.  The tacos she won with were the Quesa Tacos.  From their menu:

QuesaTacos wrapped in a blend of melted Oaxaca cheese, stuffed with our grilled shrimp cooked in Leticia's Abuelo sauce "Mild, Medium or Spicy" your choice of tortillas and topped with our chipotle cream sauce, served with our Poblano white Rice Casserole with crema, cheese and rajas, Additional filling choices of gilled Chicken, shredded Beef, Carne Asada, Carnitas, Birria, Chicken Tinga or any Saut√©ed Vegetables.

I had two original shrimp tacos.  My son had regular tacos: two Al pastor and two Birria (goat).  I gave him one of mine and took one of his birria.  FMR, they were delicious.  The Quesa Taco was superior, and the birria was tender and sweet.

When we sat down, we were brought chips and three bowls of dips: one fire-roasted salsa, one bean dip, and one an avocado-tomatillo sauce.  Excellent.  Even the beans and rice which accompanied my taco plate were spiced and cheesed.  I've never had rice in a Mexican restaurant as flavorful.

This place is in the extreme northwest, about 45 minutes drive from my house, but the drive was well worth the trip.  In a word: go.  In two words: go now!
