Service is great, positive attitudes and smiles all day long even when they are busy, and I mean they can be busy but I am more then willing to wait for my food, this is one of the few places in Las Vegas that actually has has all of the rare authentic Mexican food that's hard to find anywhere else (head, stomach, intestines), if your not into that type of food no worries, I've almost had everything on the menu and I haven't been disappointed once 

I come here at least twice a week, and I would recommend this place to anyone who is serious about great food.
