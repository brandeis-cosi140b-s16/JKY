Best restaurant near Rio Salado and Mill for US Airway employees.  The wait staff is superb.  Fridays have patience but no place can handle all of the work staff lunch within 30 minutes on a Friday.  The girls learn your orders and never make a mistake.  Great food and Service.  What more do you need?
