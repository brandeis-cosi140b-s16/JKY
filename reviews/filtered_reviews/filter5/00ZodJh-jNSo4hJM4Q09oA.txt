YUM!!!!  This place is a little gem in Mesa.  My hubby and I stopped in on a Saturday for lunch and apparently beat the rush, because right after we ordered, the line started growing out the door and onto the patio.  We ordered street tacos, of which we like both the beef ones the best.  We also both ordered a bean and cheese burrito, which was way too much food, but we both couldn't stop eating because it was one of the best bean and cheese burritos either of us had eaten before.  The salsa bar was also to die for- at least 4 different salsas to choose from along with cucumbers and pickled onions.  We took full advantage of the free check in offer of chips and salsa.  The salsa that came with the chips was chunky and juicy at the same time and had a ton of flavor!  Anytime I crave a burrito from now on, we'll be going to Backyard Taco!
