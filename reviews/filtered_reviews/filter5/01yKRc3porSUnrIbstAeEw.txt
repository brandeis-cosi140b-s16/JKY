Since leaving the beautiful state of Arizona, I always fill up on Mexican food when I'm home visiting.  This place is THE place for authentic mexican food.  It's not fancy or chic, in fact it's a hole in the wall.  It's clean just old.  Good margarita, great chips and salsa and the beans are definitely authentic.  Great meal.  This is your place if you want to experience authentic mexican food.  Tons of celebrities have visited this place, it's evident when you walk in the door and see all the autographs.
