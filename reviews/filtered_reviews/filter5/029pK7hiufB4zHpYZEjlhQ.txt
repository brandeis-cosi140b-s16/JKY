Oh Arriba, how I miss thee! We just moved from AZ to MN, and what we can't find . . . good Mexican (or New Mexican, as some of Arriba's dishes are). My absolute favorite dish is the Rio Grande Enchiladas - the spicy meat, the cheese - mmmm! 

We recently went to the Arriba in Tempe (or Awatukee?) and the service was awful, but our typical Arriba is Phoenix, and the service is good.
