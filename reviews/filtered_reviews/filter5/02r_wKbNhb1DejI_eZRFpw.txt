You can find me here at least once a weekend and usually on a Friday night after work with my hubby and some friends wanting to wind down with an amazing margarita. You'd think Arizona would have the margarita down but sadly most places don't but Sol really knows how to make a  fresh margarita on the rocks with fresh fruit and a great basil strawberry martini. I first came here on date night and loved it and we keep coming back for more. The food is really filling so we usually do two a la carte tacos a piece and its perfect plus when you arrive they give you fresh salsa and homemade tosada's.  I get the same thing every time because nothing tops it and there isn't a place in town that can beat these two tacos and yes i've been to the taco festival a few times, the tacos you have to get are the filet and shrimp el jefe and the fish taco gobernador. My husband likes the buffalada and the vampiro, which he actually never strays from and he grew up here so taco wise he is hard to please. Besides the food the environment is very pretty and has nice distilled lighting and what girl doesn't appreciate that. I would get a table outside or a 4 top at the bar and make a reservation as there is always a wait. They're on open table like most so it's super easy.
