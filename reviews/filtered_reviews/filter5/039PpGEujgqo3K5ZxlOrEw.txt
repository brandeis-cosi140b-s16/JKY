This is one of the best Mexican establishments that I have ever visited. I have eaten at La Unica twice (about a year apart). My flight into Charlotte was delayed and, instead of arriving at 4pm, I did not get in until almost 7. But my business associate who picked me up at the airport knew that a visit to La Unica was high on my priority list. He took back roads and got us there by 7:30.

What has struck me about both visits is the fact that this place is packed - both visits on weeknights (a packed restaurant is always a good sign).

The chips and salsa are great and they bring you both mild and hot salsa (I mix the two). I like the burrito combination - one beef and one chicken. The food is very tasty and served piping hot.

It's certainly not fancy. But the quality of the food MORE than makes up for the no-frills atmosphere. The service is very good; maybe not outstanding but certainly at least very good. But, again, it is the food that is the star here.

I thought that I would throw this in: They do accept credit/debit cards but not American Express.

Another visit to La Unica will be high on my to-do list for my next visit to Charlotte.
