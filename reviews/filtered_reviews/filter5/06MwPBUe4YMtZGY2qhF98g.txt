I am truly surprised on these negative reviews. By FAR the best tacos in vegas. Friendly staff, excellent service. Bryant is the man!! A gentleman sitting next to us was under the impression his dish came with a side of tortillas, which it did not. As the managers were checking on everyone, they told the man not to worry, and that they would bring out either corn, or flour right away at no charge. I will be a regular here, my husband works in the bowling department, so we come a lot on Tuesdays for happy hour. Anyways, people can make mistakes, don't be so hard on your servers!
