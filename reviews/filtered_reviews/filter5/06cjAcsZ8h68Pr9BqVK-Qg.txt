Went there during the day right when they open so we had no worry about wait time. Staff was pleasant but not really in full gear since it barely opened, so getting drinks and bread took a little longer than I would have liked having been the only people there. That is the only objection I had to my wonderful experience there. My girlfriend had the carnitas while I had the Lechon sandwich. Having had Cuban sandwiches before this one did raise the bar to one of the best I've had ever before. Wish we went during the live music and later in the evening so we could have tried the mojitos. We will be back soon!!
