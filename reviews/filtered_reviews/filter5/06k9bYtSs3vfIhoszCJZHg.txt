The ambiance of this place was so great! We had the chicken nacho and they were delicious!! We also ordered a chimichanga, chicken taco salad and a kids quesadilla! All were huge and tasty! Loaded with meat and they did not hold back on portions. One of the best Mexican places we've eaten at!! It is slightly pricy but the server and staff were amazingly attentive.
