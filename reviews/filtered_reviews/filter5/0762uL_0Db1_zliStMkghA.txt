Having recently moved to the Phx area, I wanted to find a good Mexican place. Saw an old episode of DDD last night and the food looked so good. I decided to come in since I was in the area. I ordered the tacos. The asada has a really great flavor. It had a nice char taste. My GF ordered the asada chimichanga, and it was so delicious. I think I found the place I was hoping for.
