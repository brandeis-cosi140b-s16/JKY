We've been so excited for The Stand to open and finally stopped by for dinner last night. We ordered three tacos with french fries and then went back for two more! 
I don't eat hamburgers, but from what I've heard, the burgers are supposed to be very tasty, as well. 

What a beautiful job Ron and Co. did with the remodel. Just perfect. I am looking forward to eating on their cute patio during the Spring months. 

It's so nice to have a new fast, casual place to count on for veggie tacos! Love the drive-thru!
