I ate here yesterday it was my first time so I was unsure but as soon as I walked in everyone was so nice they gave us Intel on the menu and just my like the special was everything on the menu is 5.49 it was so many item I didn't know what to choose from so I ended up with a burrito chips guacamole and queso. All their food was delicious and fresh. I was highly satisfied and the owner was really friendly. I would recommend it to any one is looking for quality fresh cuisine in charlotte.
