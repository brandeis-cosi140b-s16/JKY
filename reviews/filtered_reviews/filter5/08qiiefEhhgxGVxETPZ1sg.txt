Rachel the bartender on the patio bar!!

She was amazing. Even though I'm not in the bar industry.. I have been before.. And now I'm in the retail costumer costumer service.. She has been nothing but a sweet heart. I have never been into doing surveys or reviews but once I got into working for a company where costumer service is all about, made me realize a lot. Got to give girl props.. Cause I know it's hardworking with crazy drunk assholes and girls. (Been there )  good job girl. Your awesome ! Thank you!!!!
