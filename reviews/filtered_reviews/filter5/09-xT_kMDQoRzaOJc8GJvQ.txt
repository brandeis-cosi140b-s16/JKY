My friends and I had such a fantastic time at Macayo's Depot Cantina.  I actually served there for many years, and have always been a huge fan of the food.  It is delicious.  It is authentic.  It is consistently dynamite.  I can't say enough about the high quality of the food... Macayo's just never disappoints.  What I never got to appreciate as an employee there is what an incredible and lively atmosphere it is to dine in.  The patio is a blast.  There are lots of people, good music, plenty of shade, misters when it's hot, tv's to watch the games on, and servers on top of their game.  When our meal was finished, we cruised inside to the cantina where the atmosphere was just as energetic and buzzing.  They've got an impressive selection of tequilas and killer margaritas to enjoy.  The bartenders and cocktailers always seemed to be smiling.  Overall, the service was outstanding, the food delicious as always, and the atmosphere great.  My friends and I keep Macayo's Depot Cantina on our list of regular stops when we choose to hit up Tempe.
