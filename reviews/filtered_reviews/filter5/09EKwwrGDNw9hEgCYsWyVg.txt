The place was clean, the staff was friendly and Tony made good recommendations. They handed us a menu and gave us plenty of time to figure out what to order. My wife got the Paradise with Cheddar and some sweet potato tots. I got the Beach House (Tony's rec) and some seasoned fries. Both burgers were fantastic. My patties were perfectly charred and I loved the toasted bun. Best part about it was that it was the perfect amount of food. Not one of these places and crams a gimmicky mound of food on your plate and makes you feel guilty for not finishing or like a total fatty if you do! I finished my burger without anyone twisting my arm to do so. We will definitely be back.
