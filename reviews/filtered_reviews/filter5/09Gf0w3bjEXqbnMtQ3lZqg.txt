I really loved this place! The line to sit on the patio is quite lenghty, so make sure you do reservations WAY ahead of time. We had a party of 5 people and it took almost 45 minutes. 

The food is awesome! They had this awesome DJ singer playing and he had such a cool vibe. He even gave me a shot out and a free shot because I was celebrating my bachelorette party! 

The guac and salsa are to die for!!! I loved my chipotle fajitas!!! Yumm!!!
