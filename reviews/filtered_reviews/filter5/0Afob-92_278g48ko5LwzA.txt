It's hard to explain how good this place is.  I've tried everything on the menu now and everything but the kalamari is perfect.

Their food is very fresh and their chef is a true culinary great.  The flavor profiles are amazing, and such a thing is rare.

I could go on for pages because this is one of the 5 best restaurants I've ever been to.  Let that say it all.  Avoid the kalamari, and enjoy one of the best meals you could have.

Also the outdoor seating by the fountain is pretty great.
