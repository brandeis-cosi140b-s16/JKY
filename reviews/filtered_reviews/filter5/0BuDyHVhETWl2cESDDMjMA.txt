Um..lets talk about my new addiction and how I crave this place on the daily! I usually hit up Camelback road for some grub, but my belly was telling me to try something new, and I'm glad I did! Paquime is legit and reasonably priced. I love the pescado street tacos and their fruit popsicles. They have everything you would want in Mexican food and it is authentic. If you are having a sweet tooth, they have a pretty unique bakery as well! I am glad I found this place (:
