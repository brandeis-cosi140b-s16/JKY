Just returned from a 4 day vacation to Phoenix.  I made a special trip to Rokerij just because I had seen where they had the Richardson's menu and, as a garlic lover, I have NEVER had anything quite like Richardson's garlic appetizer.  Once again, I was not disappointed.  This dish alone will keep me coming back to this restaurant group whenever I visit Phoenix.  I liked the ambience of Rokerij,  even though we were seated in the basement.  Our server was most attentive and patient with us as we muddled through the menu and then the appetizer.  I had the Pasta Heidi and my companion had the Mixed Grill.  The flavors of both dishes were spicy and unique. 
I would assume if you're after typical Mexican food fare, you would not be happy with what is offered by these restaurants, but if you're after some unique dishes at reasonable prices,  it can't be beat!
