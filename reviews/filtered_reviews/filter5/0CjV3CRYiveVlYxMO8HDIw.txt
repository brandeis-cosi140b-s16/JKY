I give this place 5 stars first because of the service I receive. If Jj Becca, or Julie are serving you, then you can certainly count on good service. They are personable, friendly, always make sure you are taken care of and things are clean and tidy. The owner is very nice and really cares about his guests and their opinions.  The food is great! Highly recommend the blue corn enchiladas and the farmers burro.
