Wow was this food good! I just went here for the first time and I was surprised by how good the food was since I haven't found a good mexican restaurant since moving to Phoenix. The food here was incredible- I ordered the Green Chile Plate and the beef was melt in your mouth delicious as was the tortilla. The salsas that were served were delicious as well, and I preferred the green one! Nothing was too spicy but it had a good amount of spice. I will undoubtedly be coming back here when I crave mexican food.
