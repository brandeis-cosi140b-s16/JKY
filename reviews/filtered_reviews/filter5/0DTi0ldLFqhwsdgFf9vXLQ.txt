Wow...this food is really flavorful!  This is a really cool space inside the Saguaro Hotel.  Great kitschy, cool decor, friendly, hip service and delicious food.  The shrimp and chorizo tacos were fantastic and the pork carnitas tacos were very good too.  The creamy rice with corn and the corn side are both out of this world...yummy!
