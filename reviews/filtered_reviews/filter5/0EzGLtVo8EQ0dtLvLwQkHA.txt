I visited Las Vegas in mid-July, and this was a great place to get true Mexican food away from the buzz of the strip. The atmosphere is fantastic, with costumed waiters and loud, festive birthday songs not interrupting your meal, but enriching it all the more. Highly recommend this place and would love to return someday.
