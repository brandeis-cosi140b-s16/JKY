Wonderful food, service & atmosphere at a decent price.  I had the carnitas - the meat was perfectly moist, tender and just enough spice.  Hubby had a chicken burrito - it was thoroughly enjoyed.  House margarita topped the meal wonderfully.  Waitress was very attentive and friendly.  A group of 10 people came in and the staff made sure they were seated promptly.  Couldn't ask for better service.
