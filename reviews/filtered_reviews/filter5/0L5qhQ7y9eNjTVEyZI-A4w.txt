I had a great first time experience with Carolina's Mexican Food. I needed to order catering for my office with a very short notice. Carolina's was able to fit my order in when they usually ask for a 24 hour notice and I gave them a 90 minute notice! When I arrived to pick up my platters the restaurant was BUSY!! The girl behind the counter greeted me promptly, chatted and joked with me while they were packing up my order ,then carried and placed the food in my car for me. I didn't have to lift a finger! I had ordered one chicken and one beef taco platter, a full tray of chicken enchiladas, and a full tray of rice and beans. This also included chips and salsa. Everything was delicious, everyone in the office enjoyed the food and went for seconds. I did not have any complaints and all my coworkers wanted to know where I ordered the food from... Thank you Carolina's for providing my office with great food under such a short notice, with friendly customer service. I will be back!
