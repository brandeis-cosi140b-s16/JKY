Yum!! Love the free chips and salsa... the chips are Amazing and really thick and crispy. The salsa is kinda spicy but it's really really good.

Have enjoyed the beef bulgogi burritos, fish tacos, calimari tacos, kimchi fried rice, spam musubi.  I also saw them featured on a food show recently with Aaron Sanchez highlighting vegas food, cool!
