I adore this place. It's cute and quaint, but trendy. The mahi mahi tacos are refreshing and light, some of the yummiest in Phoenix for sure. The skirt steak tacos were extremely tender and flavorful. The only dish I've tried that I didn't enjoy were the chicken tacos, but probably because everything else had so much more flavor. I also love all the drink options, there is a great deal of unique liquors and specialty cocktails to try! 

This place is delicious and unique! Will definitely be back!
