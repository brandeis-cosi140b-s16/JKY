Yum! My new fav taco stop. The no-frills dive serves the best tacos around - quick, tasty and authentic,  street style tacos.

I dropped by on Friday for a quick take-out lunch, and was surprised to find the little spot super busy. The place is small, and probably seats about 25 inside and 15 on the covered patio. There's nothing fancy about this place at all so dont come here planning to hangout for an hour. Come and grab your favorite tacos, chow down and be on your way.

The carne asada and fish tacos were awesome! 

The carne asada was lightly seasoned, tender and served the way it should be - straight up on two little corn tortillas,  sprinkled with finely chopped onion and a sprinkling of cilantro. Reminds me of the LA street tacos I miss so much.

The fish taco is also excellent so you've got to try it! They use a light batter, and its quickly fried. So the fish is crisp, tender and flaky on the inside and ohhhh so yummy. They serve it drizzled with a bit of chipotle mayo and some shredded salad. You have to try this!

Tip 1 - ask for the 'bag' of sauteed onions and jalapenos.  They're an awesome addition to the tacos.

Tip 2 - order a horchata. Its fresh and sweet and topped with pecans!
