Chaos everywhere. This restaurant has 3 lines for different meats so if you want another meat you usually have to hop over or you can ask the guy in your line if he can fetch the meat for you from the other two lines. It's packed, it's cramped, it's steamy/smelly, and it's really really good. The carne asada is good, the campechana fries are good, the al pastor is flavorful, the lengua is fresh. It's all good.
