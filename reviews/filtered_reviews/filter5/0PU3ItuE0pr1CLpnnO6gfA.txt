We've been meaning to try this place.  Greg was our waiter and we were very pleased with the overall service from the staff.

I had 2 Pork and one Carne Asada taco without onions.  I was a little disappointed by the Carne being dry but... eh. Wasn't our waiter's fault.  The Pork tacos on the other hand were just DELICIOUS with the little chunks of pineapple.  Never thought those two combinations would be so amazing for my taste buds.  DEFINITELY GET THE PORK!  We'll be back for sure and our comps are good here.
