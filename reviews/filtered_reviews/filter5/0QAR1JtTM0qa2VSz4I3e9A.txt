Having been to the Phoenix location months ago, I brought my Mexican-food-craving girlfriend here the other night for a good, filling meal. We arrived and were seated despite the late hour (past 8pm on a Sunday), among two or three other occupied tables.

  Our waiter, Oscar, was quick with the humor and very amiable. We had the (huge) Botana de Camaron (ceviche, cocktail shrimp, cucumber/tomato/avocado) plate - $12 - to start and enjoyed how refreshing and tasty that was before my Torta Del Rey (5 different meats, an egg, avocado, cheese, etc) - $10 - and my girlfriend's chorizo (made in-house) tacos - $6.25 - were served to the table*.

  *Warning: bring a healthy appetite as all of these dishes are made to satisfy.

  Finished off with a slice of Tres Leches cake on the house ($5 - Mail Coupon, Thanks Oscar!) and it was sweet dreams from then on...

  TL;DR: Great spot for Mexican food in the Tempe area, excellent staff at this location... Come hungry!
