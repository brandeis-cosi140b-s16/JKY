My friend Janet and I loved our meal here. The ingredients were fresh and properly prepared The food is distinctive. And it's cheap. What's not to love?
For our meal we both got wontons and I got beef, pork and chicken tacos. We split a beef tostada.
While the chicken and pork were both good, the beef is the star here. And it was fantastic on the fusion tostada. The tostada has great, fresh toppings but instead of a corn or flour tortilla it came on something made out of rice. and the whole rice grains were still visible. I think any trip here should include a fusion tostada.
Janet tried a tofu taco since her husband is a pescetarian and she said it was quite good too. 
The only misfire for me was the mango/passionfruit iced tea. I don't get the flavors. Janet got one too and said she liked it.
Service was excellent. They were really hustling. We got there just before the lunch rush.
I would love to come back to KoMex and explore the menu.
