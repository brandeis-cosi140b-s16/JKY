I love Richard Sandoval restaurants.  Maya and Pampano in NYC are two of my favorites.  So when in AZ I had to try out La Hacienda.  One look at the happy hour menu and I was in love!

The best El Diablo Margarita for $5.00!  Prickly Pear Margarita $5.00.  A whole assortment of tacos $5.00!  Ceviche was awesome.  Guacamole amazing!
