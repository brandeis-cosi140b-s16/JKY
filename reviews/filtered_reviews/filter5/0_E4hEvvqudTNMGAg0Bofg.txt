Super delicious food. We lucked out with a super awesome server called Ashley who made some great suggestions for us. Everything from our drinks (Watermelon drink) to our mains, the Portabello with super nutritious and delicious greens, and the vegetarian Fajitas ( not on the menu, but suggested and organized by Ashley ) to the yummy dessert ( yes, suggested by Ashley!! ) At our request for less oil, they even delivered on that! :-) 

I've been to this place before- two years ago and had a good experience. Glad to note, staff is still friendly and attentive, and of course food is great!
