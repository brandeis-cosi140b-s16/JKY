THE BEST! My friends and I have been coming here for a of couple years and it is hands down our favorite spot, especially for nice spring/summer days eating outside on the patio. The decor is great and the music is always perfect for the atmosphere.  The cucumber margarita is a must try and you can easily fill up on the chips and salsa.  I don't eat meat but my friends love the tinga tacos and I am a fan of the veggie tacos and fajitas. The guacamole and nachos are also great! They have a vast selection of tequilas and a tequila hall of fame.  If you want to make the hall of fame just ask the bartender how and they'll give you all the details. It's a great way to explore and find your favorite tequila.  They also have lots of events and specials like taco tuesdays and margarita mondays.  I take all friends and family from out of town here and if/when I move, this will be the place I miss and crave the most! :)
