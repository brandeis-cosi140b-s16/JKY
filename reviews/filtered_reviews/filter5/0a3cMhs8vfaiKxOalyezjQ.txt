Discovered this little gem for Breakfast.  The Adovada with eggs is just freakin amazing!!!  Everything we ate was full of flavor and what we have been looking for since moving the Phoenix.  This is definitely our new favorite breakfast place.. I can't wait to try literally everything else on the menu!
