Great Little Gem. I have been to the original location by south mountain and figured the food would not really be the same. How wrong was I, This place has great food just like the original restaurant but with far less noise and crowds. I love Mexican food and this is my go to place in the Chandler/East Valley area. Salsa is Amaze Balls BTW
