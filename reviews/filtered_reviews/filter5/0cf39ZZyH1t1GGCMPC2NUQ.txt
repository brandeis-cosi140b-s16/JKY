A good friend of mine told me about this place so I had to try it. I ordered the beef short rib, and a lobster tacos to table share. The short rib beef was very tender and flavorful and the tacos were amazing. We also had a guacamole and chips and salsa for the table. The chips and salsa were unbelievable and the guacamole was one of my favorites ever. 

As far as drinks go, I went with the servers recommendation and I must say... it did not disappoint. I enjoyed what they called the office, patron silver accompanied by lemon, cucumber soda and st germain.

Overall this was a very pleasant experience. The food was great and our server Jordan was incredibly helpful and nice. I would 100% reccommend this to anybody in the area looking for Mexican food.
