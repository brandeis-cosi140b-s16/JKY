wow...WOW...W O W!!

this place is fantastic! i was impressed with this mexican food place. the horchata is divine!!! (no rice water powder here) I had a carne asada burrito and that was spectacular, and my husband had the red posole and i couldn't stop eating from his bowl. FIVE stars well deserved. the waiters were very nice too!! its about 12 miles from the strip but if you want some great authentic mexican food come here!
