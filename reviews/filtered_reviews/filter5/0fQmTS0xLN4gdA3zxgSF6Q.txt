I was skeptical at first glance of the exterior as it is an old Carl Jr or some other fast food location previously.....BUT this is most certainly a "looks are deceiving" moment!
They have a wonderful menu with a wide selection of dishes.
I have eaten here many times since my first visit and have never been disappointed.
The food is ALWAYS freshly prepared and seasoned wonderfully.
I would recommend this location for any meal of the day.
May I add that the Shrimp Cocktail is delicious!!
