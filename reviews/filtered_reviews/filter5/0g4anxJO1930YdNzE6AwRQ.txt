I've been coming here for years - dating back to when it was in an old coffee shop on Scottsdale Road before they moved into the current Bat Cave - and the food never disappoints. The stacked enchiladas are my favorite, complete with the fried egg on top to make everything better. The carne avobada is always tender, and all of the dishes pack plenty of heat. Service is friendly. You can't come to Scottsdale and not eat here at least once.
