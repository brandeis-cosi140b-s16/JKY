Wow. I've been a long time customer and have always loved the food, but this past weekend I was blown away! I ordered the roasted pork burrito - with red sauce (which I confirmed was the milder of the two that day) and it was probably THE best Mexican meal I've had to date. The pork was soooo tender and flavorful. I'm going back this week!
