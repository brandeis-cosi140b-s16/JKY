Hands down, the best music venue in all of AZ. They have a constant flow of amazing bands and artists, their food is delicious (you can't go wrong with a burrito conceptualized and created from the chef/owner of Pizzeria Bianco), their drinks are poured and priced right, and the staff is typically very friendly. Sound quality during the shows is always right on, and the space itself is really nice. Definitely not dingy or a dirty hole-in-the-wall like a few other PHX music venues.

The only downside I can think of is that parking can be an issue. Try to get there early and you won't have to drive around looking for a space too long.
