Several people recommended this place to me and now I'm recommending it to so many others. This place is AWESOME. My boyfriend and I have been here twice now and have tried the chorizo, mushroom, Korean, and tako (octopus) taco. It's all sooo good. The drink menu is also quite good. I had the El Diablo cocktail (ginger beer, lime, and cassis) and it was refreshing and delicious. My only complaint was that the drink took a really long time to get. I had basically finished all my food and then the server brought over my drink. 

Anyways, they're pretty much booked all the time, so if you're hoping to make a reservation, I'd recommend doing that a few weeks in advance for a "normal" dinner hour. I was looking about two weeks in advance and only saw reservations for times like 10pm, which may be a normal dinner hour for some, but a bit too late for me. We ended up just going around 6pm and putting our names on the list. They said it would be about an hour, so we went down the street to another place to hang out. They texted me saying they had a table for us in about 45 minutes, so I'd say that wasn't so bad. One of the times we sat at the counter by their open kitchen and it was so fun watching them make the tacos. I kept enthusiastically saying how good the tacos were, so I hope I wasn't annoying them too much. I couldn't help it, they were really that amazing!
