Be Prepared for Excellent Spicy Flavor!!! I really like spicy and the food is very flavorful. I'm kinda bummed to see so many negative reviews due to the spice content because they are proud of their spicy content. I personally have been many times and each has been an excellent experience to my palate; I try something new each time I go too. But don't go with a Gringo tongue if you don't like spicy then complain after getting burnt, kinda like being mad if a bear bites you after poking it.
