We took a chance on this small restaurant in a strip mall with a groupon.  This place is unbelievable!  The chips came with 3 kinds of salsa- each one better than the other.  Everything is home made. I had the salad with carne asada .   The portion was huge.    We tried the guacamole, cane asada tacos and the beans.   You can't get any better than this.  We will be sure to return and recommend to all of our friends.  Thank you!
