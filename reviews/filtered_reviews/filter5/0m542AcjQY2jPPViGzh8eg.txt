Very great and nice people here! Chef Paco is so polite and terrific! Their Mexican Chili has to be the best chili ever (besides my moms). Carne asada tacos are also a great choice! I never had flan before because I hear so many mixed reviews! A friend of mine who eats here a lot insisted I try it! I'm glad that I did! I recommend it highly for dessert! Over all I had a great experience all the employees are very nice and show great customer service. Even the manager checks to see how your meal and how your experience went, which rarely happens now when you eat in a restaurant! I will definitely be back!!
