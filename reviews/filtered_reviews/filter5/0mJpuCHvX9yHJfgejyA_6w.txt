Wow! I am truly amazed by this place and it is now one of my favorite places. It is small so not recommended for big groups but the food is OUTSTANDING. I had the Pacific white fish tacos with rice and beans Amazing 
My boyfriend and son had the carne Asada style burrito and a rice and beans burrito both said thy were amazing. The guacamole was delish and the horchata was really good. My boyfriend even said it tasted like Christmas lol 
This place is really good and I was very impressed service was good can't wait to come back again
