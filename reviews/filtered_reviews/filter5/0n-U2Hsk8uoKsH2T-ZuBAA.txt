This place is amazing! Quick customer service with quality sushi! We rarely make it to sushi these days because of the cost but having a place where you can get a sushi burrito (technically just like a sushi roll) for $9-$12 you can beat that price! I had the baja sushi burrito and it was just want I was craving at only $9! They not only have sushi burritos they have regular burritos as well and some delicious combos to go with your burrito! Sushi lover or not you should check this place out!
