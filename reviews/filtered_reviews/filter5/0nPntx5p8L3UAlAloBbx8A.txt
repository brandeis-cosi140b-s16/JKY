I love this place and come here for lunch at least once a week.  I can eat here everyday and not be tired of the flavor.  The large and spacious seating area is a big plus. 

 I usually get the carne asada tacos and beef tongue (Lengua) tacos.  Today I discovered their amazing carnita (pork).  I will definitely get the carnita quesadilla next time (add guacamole and salsa).  You can ask for a sample of the meat.  

I wish this place is closer to my house!!!
