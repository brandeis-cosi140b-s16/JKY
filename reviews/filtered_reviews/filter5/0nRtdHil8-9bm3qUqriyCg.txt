I recently had one of the most disappointing experiences in a restaurant that I can remember and it made me want to review one of the best experiences I've had in Charlotte: Cabo Fish Taco. There's a ton that's been said about this place. It's got a lot of hype and lines out the door to prove it. After living in Charlotte for almost 20 years, it was time for me to try it out. And it did not disappoint!

Food- 2/2
*Excellent. Loved the flavors of the BBQ Mahi tacos. We tried several different kinds and loved them all. They were really something I had never tried before. Personally, I loved the corn salsa that comes with the chips. We order an appetizer of queso, and it was also very, very good. One minor note that I believe to be a fluke- the chips seemed a little stale. I haven't read any comments about them before, so it probably was just a bad batch. 

Atmosphere- 1/1
*As mentioned elsewhere, it is loud inside. But I didn't sit inside, I waited the extra 15 minutes and sat outside on a beautiful June evening. It was worth the wait. This place fancies itself as a West Coast taco shop and sitting outside, it felt that way to me. I don't know if I would go back and not sit outside. I enjoyed the atmosphere there. 

Price- 1/1
*No major complaints. Normally, I would frown on paying $12-15 for two tacos, but they filled me up and is loved them. I'm willing to pay a few extra dollars if I like the food and I leave full. 

Service- 1/1
*I cannot write enough good things about the service that we received here. It wasn't that it was over the top or extra attentive. Our waiter was running around like crazy, it was packed. Yet despite the busyness of the evening, our waiter really valued us. He gave great recommendations. It was clear he had tried everything on the menu multiple times. He never missed a refill on drinks or chips. And here's the thing that awesome: I love queso. I will eat every last drop of queso and the lick the bowl. I love queso. Our waiter had noticed me scooping out every last drop and unannounced brought us another bowl of it, free of charge! Now, I didn't need any more queso, since this was after our meal. But this communicated a ton to me: it communicated that he took notice of the experience I was having and he wanted to g out of his way to make sure that I wasn't just having a good night at Cabo, but a great night. Most wait staff don't operate as if it's their restaurant that they are invested in. I don't know who this guy was, but you could tell this was HIS restaurant and that mattered to him. I loved it (both the queso and the gesture). I've never experienced anything quite like that. It was awesome. 

I live 30-35 minutes away from NoDa. It's a trendy area and I'm hardly trendy. In fact, most of the time I feel out of place and uncomfortable around so many cool, hip people. Needless to say, I don't stumble into the NoDa area. And yet, I can't wait to go back. The other night I was getting takeout by myself and I wrestled long and hard about making the drive, finding a weird place to park and walking through crowds of people that are much cooler than me just to eat those tacos again. And I don't think I'd feel that way if it weren't for out waiter that night. He was awesome and whoever he is- 'thanks for taking care of us that night. You realize we could have eaten a lot of places and we tried your restaurant. It won't be the last time.'
