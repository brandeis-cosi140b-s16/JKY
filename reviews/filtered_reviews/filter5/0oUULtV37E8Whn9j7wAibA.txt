The food here is amazing. (there is no way you can compare Los Frijoles to Roberto's) It is right around the the corner from my house so my husband and I went there for the opening and we loved it! their staff is super friendly, we've often seen the owner in there serving and cleaning tables, talking to people and everything. The aguas frecas are made with real fruit, which is very hard to find. Being mexican I can tell you that if you want real tacos and aguas frescas got to frijoles. the place is always super clean which is always a plus! 

Note: I have a cousin who came from Mexico to visit and we've taken her out to eat tacos to many places and she said that the only place that's even close to the real mexican tacos is Los Frijoles.
