This place is on point!!! Between the giant nacho platter, the enchiladas, the kids burger, and the queso, it was awesome. The staff here all seems to be friendly, and the manager even checked on us, which I haven't seen in quite a while at other places. We live in the north part of town and came down to Summerlin for errands, but this place is worth the drive alone!!
