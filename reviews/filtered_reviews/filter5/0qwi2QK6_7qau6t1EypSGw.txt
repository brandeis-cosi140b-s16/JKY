This place was a pleasant surprise! The food was amazing--best rice I've had at a Mexican restaurant. The staff works as a team, at least 4 people checked on us to make sure we were enjoying our meal. As someone who works in the hospitality indistry, I was extremely impressed with the level of service & quality of the food. Our server Angel was very warm & funny, & the manager Costa made us feel welcome. I wish we lived closer to this place, we'd eat here every week!
