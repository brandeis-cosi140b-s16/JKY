This is a late review from our dining experience back in February.  

Fusion at it's best.   Mexican and Chinese such a great combination resulting in excellent food!   Since we were a party of 5 we were able to try several dishes.    Must try dishes: tuna ceviche, langosta and carnitas tacos, quail egg Sui Mai and the 20 vegetable fried rice.   The salt air margarita is a must try drink.
