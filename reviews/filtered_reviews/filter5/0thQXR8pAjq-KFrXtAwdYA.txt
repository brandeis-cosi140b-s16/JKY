Came here for the first time about two weeks ago with my boyfriend and his friends for industry night, and let me tell you it was AMAZING. We had there heat margaritas which were the best I've ever had. We also ordered nachos, tacos, tips and salsa and it was all outstanding. I had the lobster tacos which were phenomenal. I have been ragging about these tacos for weeks now and cannot wait to go back next week. The waitress was great, I loved the atmosphere, overall I have no complaints. Oh and what I originally ordered I believe was the chile relleno which they were out of so they compd my tacos. No that is what I call hospitality.
