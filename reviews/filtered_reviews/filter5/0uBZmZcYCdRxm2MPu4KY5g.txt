I went during happy hour. I started off with their $5 margarita, I'm not a big fan of margaritas but I thought this was one was pretty good. I order 4 street tacos, one of carnitas, one of carne asada, one al pastor, and one of shredded chicken. The chicken was okay, but the al pastor and asada tacos were amazing!!! To top it off their salsas are delicious. I also had their tinga tostadas, which were pretty good. I then concluded the meal with a flan... And it was magnificent. The service was great, the food was amazing, the prices were fair. Overall this place is definitely worth a 5 star rating.
