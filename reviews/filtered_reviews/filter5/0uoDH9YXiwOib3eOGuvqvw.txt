I'm from San Francisco and visit Vegas a few times a year on work and every time I go I do WHATEVER IT TAKES to make it out to Carlitio's. They have hands down, the best breakfast burrito I've ever had in my life. It's the size of a super burrito at most places and full of the freshest and tastiest ingredients you could ask for. The employee's are all super upbeat and friendly and the food comes out pretty quick. My only complaint... all 5 times that I've been now, I've had to stand around and wait for a table to open up. I'd love to see these guys move to a location just a tad bit bigger, it would really go a long way.
