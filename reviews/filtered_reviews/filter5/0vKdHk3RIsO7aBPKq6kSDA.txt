I love the ambiance and decor of El Sombrero. I am always on the look out for new restaurants. Especially downtown Las Vegas because thats my hood.  I was presently surprised when I had my date night there , I really have high expectations, especially on date night. My husband is very particular and unlike me will not eat many peoples food. Well El sombero did it for us. The food was spectatular, The Fish was fresh, the skirt steak was perfectly cooked and the service was great, The owner came by and chatted and the chef sent by a treat from kitchen, The sangria was flowing and we even ate the fruits from the pitcher for Dessert, I love a date night that you can drink be merry then walk home. My Sombrero off to you.
