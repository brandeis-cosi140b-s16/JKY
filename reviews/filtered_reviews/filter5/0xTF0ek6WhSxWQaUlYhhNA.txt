Phoenix friends, if you haven't experienced Barrio Caf√© you done know what you are missing.  I anticipated a little taquerid was pleasantly surprised to find this to be do much more.  Guacamole made tableside was excellent, the seasonal Poblano chili dish was amazing. Service was excellent and we will definitely be returning.
