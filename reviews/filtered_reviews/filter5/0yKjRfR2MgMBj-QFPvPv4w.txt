Goodness gracious this place knows how to cook up some mean tacos. Try the Volteados. I hardly ever go for pork, but the way they melt the cheese on top of the pork, then combine the dish with avocado and delicious hot salsa is an absolute party in the mouth. Nice authentic feel to the place too. Latin music playing and everything is written in Spanish. However, it's also got your good ol' white people Mexican food restaurant vibe. Lots of seating, cute servers, and a nice millennial atmosphere. Absolutely one of the best Mexican joints in PHX.
