Food & service was excellent. Salsa was fresh and spicy, guac was great. I only had 2 tacos but would have loved to eat more. The shrimp was fantastic, there were different levels of flavor. I added some chipotle mayo hot sauce on it. Steak taco was great as well. The atmosphere was very relaxed, great bar area & outdoor dining. Margaritas were good & great Mexican beer selection on tap!
