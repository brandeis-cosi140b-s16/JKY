This is my go-to place in my new neighborhood!  I think I ate here 3 times in one week, during my move and lack of kitchen.  I love their chili rubbed salmon!  I am not sure what they do to the potatoes that come on the side, but they are amazing!  I recommend eating the chili, the potatoes are served in, along with them; it really adds to the flavors!  The servers and bartenders are very friendly, insightful about the menu, and accommodating.  The chips and fresh salsa served with any entree are so delicious, I ended up buying a jar to take home (comes in a cute jar too).  You do not need a reservation here, but it always seems to be quite busy. 

Blue Adobe also has live music Thursday through Saturday, but it is not open that late (maybe 11 or so).  I saw Ivan on Thursday and he played an acoustic guitar and sang with a unique, sexy voice ;)  He also did some great renditions of a few classic Christmas Carols for the holidays.
