My friends and I went to happy hour this weekend. I must say it wAsnt too busy and we had a great time, not to mention the service and drinks were great. Jenny advised us on the margarita specials and they were lovely. Both bartenders were friendly and courteous. The other bartender had long black hair kinda curly wavey and pretty smile. Thx again.
