The food was wonderful!  The chef and Jesse were great.  We came in with my friend and we tried each other's food.  So tasty,  great flavors,  I finally had seafood enchiladas that didn't taste fishy but only tasted great!   We loved our chicken empanadas and make room for deliciousness with their churros.  Happiness!  That is how we left oh and crazy full. Thank you for opening up!  My boyfriend and I will be back!
