Ok folks, Green Dacha was a really fun and delicious  experience for me. Especially if you like good authentic Russian, Eastern-European kitchen like I do. Great warm environment with excellent customer service kind of place. Live entertainment happens couple times a week, karaoke nights are super fun, and also, if you are a hookah lover, this place is for you. The owner is a young progressive energetic individual, so is his place!
