This place is great, love the colourful theme and what's amazing is the carved painted wooden benches love it. 

Hostess was nice and pleasant, she seated us as soon as we walked in. Our waitress was at our table in seconds taking our drink order, another server brought us chips and salsa immediately as well for us to snack on. Drinks came quickly and were great, I had a dos Equis lager on tap and my wife had a margarita on the rocks and both were great. 

Our food order was taken and it seemed like our food came out in less than 10 minutes, it actually seems like about 8. Food was hot and presentation was amazing as well as the flavours, very pleased at this point. I usually skip dessert but today we decided to have the fried ice cream and we are glad we did it was fantastic, the three of us shared it and we had trouble eating it all. 

I will be recommending this place and returning soon.
