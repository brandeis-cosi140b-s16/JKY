I come here at least once a week! These burritos are amazing. The flour tortillas are made daily by a local tortilla maker and they're the best way to wrap up all the ingredients inside (though I would probably order a stack of tortillas to go if I could). I get the red chile beef burrito every time with refried beans, rice, cheese, sour cream and guac. The chunks of beef are tender and the sauce makes the burrito gooey and amazing. This is comfort food...Best burritos in Phoenix. A must try!
