I love this place! Service is good, fast & the food is amazing! Its not hard to find although you probably won't be on the East side of Las Vegas... unless you live on this side of town, of course. 

I ordered the regular cheese "boyger" (get it? lol) and the chenco fries! The boyger was so juicy and a really good size portion for me. The chencho fries is one of their popular plates. You can either order skinny or thick cut fries. I ordered the skinny fries and on top has cheese and all their different types of sauces!

My boyfriend ordered the wet burrito.. and WOW, it was HUGE! It had their special sauces on top as well.. i don't know what it is, but it is soo good! 

Definitely worth the try if you are at the East side of town in Las Vegas!
