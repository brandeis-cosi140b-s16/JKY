Terrific street tacos! We tried the carna asada, shrimp, and fish.  All were excellent and reasonably priced.  Had the rice and pinto beans-nothing to write home about here, they should put some effort into these two areas (not horrible but they really don't compliment the awesome tacos.  I didn't see any horchata on the menu and would have liked some but the Mexican coke was delicious.  I'll be back!
