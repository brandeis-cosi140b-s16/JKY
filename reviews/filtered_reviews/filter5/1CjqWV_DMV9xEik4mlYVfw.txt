My sister-in-law threw a surprise birthday party for my brother at Chuy's and it was really great.  They didn't let on to the surprise at all.  The food was good and service was excellent.  Good work Zack & other guy I didn't get the name.  Also, the other party room with the palm trees looked really cool.
