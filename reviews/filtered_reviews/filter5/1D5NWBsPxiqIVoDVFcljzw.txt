Valle Luna is one of the best Mexican restaurants in the valley! The atmosphere is great and all the employees there are very friendly! I recently discovered jalapeno cream cheese sauce over my shredded beef burrito! Amazing! If you're new to Arizona and you want some good Mexican food go to Valle Luna!
