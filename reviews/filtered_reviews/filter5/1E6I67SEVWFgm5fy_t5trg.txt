Where do I start???  The decor is amazing. The patio is so well done. The people are a unique mix of fun. This place has a great atmosphere evidenced by everyone smiling. Now for the food. The menu is.simple but the chefs suggestions are spot on. I had fish, carne asada and chicken tacos. All were top notch. I highly recommend stepping out of your comfort zone and tasting the unique flavors.
