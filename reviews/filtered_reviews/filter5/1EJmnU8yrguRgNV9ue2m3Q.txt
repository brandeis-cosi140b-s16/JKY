FAQ

Q: Mexican food inside the Venetian. Doesn't that strike you as odd?
A: A city built in the middle of the desert that thrives on gambling and entertainment (adult and otherwise)? A fake Champs Elysees on Las Vegas Blvd.? A city where public intoxication on the main street is okay as long as you're not stumbling and puking? Doesn't that strike you as odd?

No. Of course not. It's Vegas (obligatory: baby)!

Q: How is the sangria here?
A: Oh! I'm glad you asked. It is absolutely delicious. Chilled to perfection. Nice large chunks of fruit in there. Get a pitcher. Get two! Thank me later! I don't have sangria often but this is the benchmark on which all other sangria pitchers will be judged.

Q: Woah, this looks like it's right next to the canal, right?
A: Totally! It's good times. Be bold, heckle the tourists and the gondola operator.

FYI ... Good times, good people, good location, good food, good booze. No hassles? 5-stars!
