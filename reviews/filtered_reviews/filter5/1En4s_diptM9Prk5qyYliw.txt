After having multiple bad experiences with other local Mexican restaurants a friend recommended this to us. It was fabulous! Small and quaint, you really get the feeling of being at home. They bring you 4 different salsas which is a plus in my book, also the serving sizes are HUGE plenty to take home. Also loved that they added grilled pineapple to the fajitas! The best part about the food is that it came out fresh & not pre made like most typical Mexican restaurants. Will most definitely be returning!
