Its my new favorite spot! Cute, small atmosphere! I ordered the carne asada tacos and blackened chicken tacos, both with corn tortillas.  The carne asada taco had a little too much lettuce, but the steak was flavorful! The blackened chicken tacos were so good, it was like a explosion in my mouth! I think the next time I come here I would definitely get the chicken tacos with flour tortillas! I would definitely recommend this place to my friends!
