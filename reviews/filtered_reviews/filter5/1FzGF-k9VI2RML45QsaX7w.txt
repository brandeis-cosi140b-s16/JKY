This is my absolute favorite mexican restaurant in this area. The service is fantastic, the food is amazing, and the atmosphere is relaxing and upscale.

I have been here several times and never had to wait for a table -- the restaurant is huge. 

I typically order the tableside guacamole which is hands down THE BEST guacamole  . It is expensive but they make a lot of it and it's absolutely delicious. Last night I ordered the queso with ground beef -- sooo yummy. My boyfriend and I ordered another round of chips just to finish it -- and we didn't even get close. It was so filling that by the time my entree came I was pretty full.

I always get the same thing here -- beef fajitas with no beans, extra rice, and a side of shredded jack cheese. The beef here tastes like pretty good quality and is flavored perfectly. They give you a lot of food. I usually have one fajita and take the rest home.

When I'm in the mood to drink I love their mojitos -- they are all amazingly good. A bit pricey but you get a huge, tall drink. 

The only downside to Cantina Laredo is their dessert selection. I'm not a fan of any desserts they offer. However, my boyfriend loves the flan. He is from Argentina and says it's very well-done.
