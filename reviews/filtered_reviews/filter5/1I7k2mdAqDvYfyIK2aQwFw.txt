They are old fashion burgers that actually have alot of flavor and fresh ingredients. They are actually doing what a big chain that tries to get you "in and out" claims to do in that nothing is frozen and everything is fresh. Only they do it much better. All the ingredients are fresh daily and the burger is hand crafted to order. Honestly it is one of the best burgers I think I have ever had and I think everyone should give it a shot. We also got their fries which were wonderful and their Mexican corn which I am having a craving for right now. I also have had their shakes previously and can't say enough good things about them either. As if the food wasn't enough, the entire staff was friendly and helpful! We will be back and I hope anyone reading this will give them a shot!
