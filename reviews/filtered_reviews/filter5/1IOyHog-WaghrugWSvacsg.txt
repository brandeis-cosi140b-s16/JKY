There are very few places where my girlfriend and I can agree to eat. We have completely opposite tastes in food, so going to dinner usually leaves one of us feeling a bit unsatisfied. 

We've agreed on Nandos three times in the past two weeks. 

The food is always excellent. As soon as you sit down you are given chips and salsa that are entirely too easy to fill up on. Both the fajitas and the quesadilla had a very generous portion of steak, easily the biggest I have ever had at comparable places. As a diabetic, I almost never eat sweets, but the fried ice cream is just too much to resist. It is so good that I happily sacrifice a day's worth of insulin to eat it. 

The service is outstanding, and the atmosphere is bright and friendly.
