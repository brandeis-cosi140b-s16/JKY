Was up north and was looking for something to eat. We yelped and this restaurant came up. My cousin got so excited and was like we have to go there. I had seen their other location on rainbow before and had wondered about the place so I agreed and we went.

Super glad we did too!! We walked in and we were greeted right away, SUPER friendly guy, asked if we had been there before and explained how it worked. He was patient especially since we had kids who wanted to order on thier own. Service is definitely 5+stars!

So its kinda like chipotle/subway order as you move down the line and create your own item. I had a wheat flour burrito with chicken and kalua pig with seaweed rice and mango salsa (I believe). It was amazing!!! Ended my meal with the coconut bark, I'm not a big lover of coconut either but it was really good.
