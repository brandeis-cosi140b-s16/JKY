Excellent service. Delicious house made chips and tortillas. Tried the Mexican corn- yum. Sampled the BBQ pork tacos and fish tacos on corn and flour tortillas respectively- would recommend both. Our server was extremely attentive. Will be back. Have not been disappointed with any Fox restaurants.  Very welcoming decor. Great lunch or dinner stop when near the Biltmore.
