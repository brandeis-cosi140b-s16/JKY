This places is miles above the Filiberto's, Ariberto's, or any other widget-bertos that you come across in the great state of AZ. Like many of the reviews have said, the tortillas are soft and chewy and thoroughly delicious. I work right around the corner from this place, and it is incredibly crowded at lunchtime. May fav is the bean and potato burrito - just the tastiest thing. I know you are thinking - potato? In a burrito... but it's good I promise!

I have a very sensitive stomach.. this might be TMI but my friends always make fun of "Grandma" that can't eat at crappy food establishments.. i.e. Jack 'n the Box because "remember that one time we went there and then went straight to Disneyland? Michelle almost lost it on Space Mountain!"

I can't eat at a lot of mexican joints that will "tear you up" as my guy friends say... and this place doesn't do that! So, for that, you get 5 stars Carolinas!
