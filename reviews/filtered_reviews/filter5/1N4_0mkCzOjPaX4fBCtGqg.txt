This place is great. I've been here twice now, and I've tried three different burritos. The burrito with machaca and eggs is by far my favorite. The service is a little bit slow, but everything is made fresh. It's a family-owned and family-run restaurant, which I like a lot-- I like to support local businesses. The prices are extremely reasonable and the portions are generous.
