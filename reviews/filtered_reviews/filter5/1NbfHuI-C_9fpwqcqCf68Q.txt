Feel like I'm just repeating what everyone said but it's that good. We went on a Saturday about 1pm and the place was packed. We waited about 15 and got seated.  Great service and salsa bar. Got the carne asada tacos and they were delicious. With the many salsas that they have you can really add many different flavors to your tacos. Loved it but I think next time I will go during off peak hours
