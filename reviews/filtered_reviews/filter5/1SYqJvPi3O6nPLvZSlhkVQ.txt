Our Friday night ritual margaritas and the best New Mexico smokey spicy Mexican food in town. My husband and I have been coming every Friday night rain or shine since the opening. When you ask my daughter what she wants for dinner she shouts La Ristra! Out of all the servers we have had Brad is the best! Hands down he has the best service. Great patio fresh food and this place never gets old. I big red heart this place.
