I love Chino Bandito!  Sometimes when a place tries to combine too many genres of food nothing ends up turning out well but they definitely manage to defy this logic.  

The food is a mix between Jamaican, Mexican, and Chinese.   All of which I love.  The ordering system is a bit confusing but the staff is always extremely helpful, cheerful, and will offer to guide you through Chino "University" with samples of some of their top dishes.  

I always get a combo with jamaican black beans, pork fried rice, machaca in a quesadilla, and either the jade red chicken or pollo diablo.  I'm sure the other selections on the menu are also great but this combo has been a winner from day one so I tend not to stray too far from it :-)  I did try the jerk chicken once and wasn't a big fan, although they do claim it is one of their top dishes.  The emerald green chicken was tasty as a sample but I'm not sure I could eat an entire dish.  I believe the jade red chicken is their top seller and I can definitely understand why.

Also, both locations (19th ave and greenway and the Chandler blvd and Dobson) are great.  I prefer the 19th Ave location since it is the original but both locations have the same great food.  I know sometimes people are wary of straying from the original location for fear the quality of the dishes may be compromised.  The owners would be smart to open up a 3rd location near ASU's main campus.  Students would love this place, especially since you get such enormous portions for about $10.  Plus, this is for my own selfish reasons since I would like a location closer to  me :-)

Love it! Check it out people!
