I have to say it stands to question an Asian/Mexican cuisine but it is a pleasant surprise! The salsa assortment was delicious and it is worth getting the tostada for chips as they do not come with the sampling. This is a tapas place, come to share and come to eat! Tried everything from the sushi to the Korean tacos to the bacon wrapped chorizo stuffed dates and all was wonderful. The only item that fell flat was the tacos el pastor, those get a solid 'meh'.
