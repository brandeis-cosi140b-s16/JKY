Found this gem sunday 9/6/2015. This was some top notch mariscos/seafood! Just the perfect fix for the hangover from the night prior. Huge portions. I had oysters, a huge cocktel, ceviche tostadas, and a huge michelada that had shrimp, cucumber, and oysters. The price was super reasonable. $60 for all the food listed. Great service. They have some very hard working ladies in there.

Will return hopefully soon.
