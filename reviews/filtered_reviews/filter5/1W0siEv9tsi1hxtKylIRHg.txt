A bunch of us coworkers have been coming here for years. Rito's burro meat is definitely slow cooked with the sauce and so, so tender! My favorite is the Green Chili meat Burro, Green Enchillada style (ask for Green on Green). Taco's are incredible but no way way add that with the Green on Green without someone rolling you back to the car! I've been to Carolina's and it tastes good, but seems like their meat doesn't get the red or green put on until you order. This is a must try place, they now take plastic, outdoor picnic benches, but that hasn't kept us away for last 20 years!
