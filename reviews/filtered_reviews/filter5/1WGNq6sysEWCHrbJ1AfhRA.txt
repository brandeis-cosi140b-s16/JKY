I eat Mexican about 3 times a week and this place has by far the best chips and salsa hands down. The service was excellent and my salsa bowl was refilled three times without me even having to ask.
The prices are at the high end of Mexican food but the food was really really good. Def recommend this place to any serious Mexican food fan.
