In town with the family, we choose to eat out at a Mexican Restaurant, they being locals and we being from out of town took their word.

This place serves you chips with beans and salsa to start and their re-fried beans are amazing delicious. 
When I ordered my food I had to ask for another side of re-fried beans.

I tried their Green Chicken Enchiladas, the sauce was not spicy at all which is a plus, because if the food is too spicy where you can't even enjoy it that's not a good experience.

I got 2 enchiladas with rice and beans and that was enough to fill me up, I wasn't left hungry or over full either.

My family members ate the Shrimp Ceviche Tostadas, I tried one of these and they were amazing.

This place was a good pick, they had music, great tasting food, the price was right, the atmosphere was nice and the servers were very fast and nice.
