I can't say enough good thugs about Sonrisa and it's hands on owner Chanthy. This is my second year hosting an event at Lake Las Vegas and I wouldn't do it without Sonrisa. 

Last year I worked with five different restaurants in the Village and we had a great event. This year Chanthy coordinated every meal and break and I couldn't be happier. It was so easy! They had all different types of food for every day - Asian buffet, BBQ ribs and corn with sliders and wings and of course traditional Mexican. We watched March Madness basketball games on the patio with a view of the lake. 

She also coordinated a fantastic casino night event for our group. We had table games, a karaoke station and a photo booth. Such a fun night.
