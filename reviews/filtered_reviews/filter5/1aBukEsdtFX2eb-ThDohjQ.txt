Came to Vegas to hang for a couple of days with my son. We got burned out on the strip and Yelped Mexican, found KoMex, grabbed the car and drove right over - TOTALLY worth the drive! I had the fusion fish tacos and my son got the bulgogi burrito - for 20 years I've been on the hunt for the best fish taco and I think I found it at KoMex - I also ordered a half order of kimchi fried rice but they brought me a full order by mistake - oops - I had to leave with the other half to take home but they only charged me half (!) great food great service and great prices I wish I could take this great little hole-in-the-wall treasure home to San Jose with me...
