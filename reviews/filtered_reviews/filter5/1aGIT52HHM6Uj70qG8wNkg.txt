Oh my gosh!!! This is the best chicken in the universe! No other chicken place comes close to  being this good! Service is wonderful too. My sister's husband wanted El Pollo Loco. He can't get it where they live. She was afraid to bring him Supremo instead of  Loco, so she took him both. Guess which one he picked as his new favorite? Yup, Supremo won hands down! I can't wait to go back. It was so delicious!
