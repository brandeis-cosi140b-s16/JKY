Good bye Taco Bell and Roberto's. Taco Y Taco will be the only place I will ever get tacos or burritos at. I guess I'm a little late hopping onto the train but I'll give you some pointers before you go. You might feel like $2.50/taco is a little pricey but they do have the typical side items you find at Roberto's such as the salsas, cucumbers and what not and this location is just too fancy to have it be a fast food place. 

#1: Do your research. Look on yelp for pictures of the menu and learn what the Spanish words mean. With so many cow parts, pig parts to choose from, you really won't know which to get (or order one of each). However, of the ones I tried, the Al Pastor (pork) and the Tripas tacos were the best. 

#2: DO GET THE CORN. Sweet, juicy, covered in butter and parmesan cheese. Yum-O. 

#3: Get all 8 sauces/salsas. Don't question what the bright green, pale green, red, orange ones are. Just get them and dip everything in them. You'll eventually find your favorite.
