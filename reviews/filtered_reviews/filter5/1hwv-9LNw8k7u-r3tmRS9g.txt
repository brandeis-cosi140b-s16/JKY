My family and I have been here 2 or 3 times and each time it's been great!  We found it on accident, and oh what a fortunate accident!  Their homemade salsa is fantastic, very garlicky which I love!  The pico de gallo is fantastic.  Bananas Ranas needs to take a note from this place (they serve Pace, wtf?)

We're working our way through the menu.  We took a visiting friend to this restaurant with us last time and he was very glad we did, loved dinner!
