Great service and delicious food.  Excellent bar.  Chicken quesadilla is everything you want in a tasty take on a classic.  Crab cakes had a little spicy bite to them, which was well recieved and much appreciated.  Gorgeous table covering helped set the place apart from ordinary.  Can't wait to return.
