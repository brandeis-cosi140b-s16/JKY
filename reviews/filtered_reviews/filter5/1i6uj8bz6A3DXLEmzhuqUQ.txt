I dont think i can put into words how much i enjoyed there food here! The bulgogi burrito w/kim chee was amazing. This place has such good prices and for the amount of food you receive you wont be disappointed but im sure youll be going back for more. The Korean musubi was another thing i was able to try and even that, such a simple dish but made with a twist, so ono! My co worker got the Mongolian beef stir fry with fried rice and the plate was also pretty huge and the taste was definitely a winner! Theres alot of free parking and its not hard to find. So next time your in the area definitely stop in at KoMex!!!
