Jade red chicken. Jerk fried rice. Diablo chicken. My regular order

This is the best take out food I've ever had. Besides the garbage plate from back home in western NY. 

Take a few minutes to check out the menu before ordering. You can get the same thing in tons of different ways. Pretty affordable and comes with a snickerdoodle cookie. Quit reading reviews - just order some damn food
