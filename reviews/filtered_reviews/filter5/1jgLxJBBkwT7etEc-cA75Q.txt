I was privileged enough to have dinner here the other night for a group birthday party.  I must admit that the food was exceptional.  I grew up eating homemade Mexican food, so I'm already pretty picky when it comes to that type of cuisine.  

Los Dos surprised me with their New Mexican style Mexican food.  Nice and spicy is the way I like to eat my Mexican food and they delivered just that.  Great atmosphere and friendly staff.  This will be one of my spots to indulge when I get my homemade Mexican food craving.

Green chile burrito all the way!
