I was in the area around lunch time so I yelped a restaurant and this one seemed to get pretty good reviews. 
The interior looks a little dingy so I expected that I would have to order at the counter, but it turned out to be a sit down restaurant. They give you chips, salsa and guacamole when you first sit down. I had the half order bogogi chicken plate with rice, and it was GREAT! The portion was the perfect and really filling. 
The service was also really good. I would definitely come back.
