I first discovered Blanco in Scottsdale a couple years ago while in AZ for work. I was so excited to be coming back to Phoenix. I still craved the blood orange margarita with the sugar rim and the amazing food. 

Tonight I made a reservation for 7 people at 7 pm at the Camelback location.  I figured as most restaurants I've been to that we would arrive and be told they would have a table for us soon. 

Not the case here; I felt like a celebrity!! 

I received a text message from Blanco at 6 pm and then when we arrived at 7, they had a table with a reserved sign on it fully dressed with chips and salsa waiting to greet us. 

Well done Blanco!!  I was the only one in the group who had been before and the the food and service certainly earned 6 more fans.
