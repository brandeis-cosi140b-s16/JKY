We were pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. It is quaint and has a large outdoor patio as well as a large indoor space. We opted for the bar. Had a beer and a margarita (very nice). The complementary chips, fresh and warm, came with a salsa trio (mild tomato, medium avocado tomatillo and hot tomato) was very flavorful! The menu offerings are many and I chose the carne asada relle√±o, which was the best meal! A roasted pepper filled with cheesy goodness, topped with mashed potatoes and steak cooked to perfection.  My husband chose the carnitas burrito without any of the sauce on top, which he later regretted as the tortilla was dry. The atmosphere was hopping, the staff is very attentive and friendly. A must in downtown Cave Creek!
