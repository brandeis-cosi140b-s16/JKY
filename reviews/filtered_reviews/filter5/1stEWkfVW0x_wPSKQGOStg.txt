This is where it's at! If you are looking for really good, cheap and somewhat late night (I think they are open till 11pm) mexican food, you've got to try Rosita's. I absolutely loooove their mole sauce-- best in the Valley. Try the beans and rice burro, enchilada style with mole.  Pair it with a nice cold Pacifico-- Sunday afternoon Heaven! Their salsas are to die for, and both the red and green pack some serious punch!  You've got to pay a dollar for chips, but it's so worth it. The tamales are also muy delisioso!

The little old ladies who work here are absolutely adorable in their little matching dresses. They are no nonsense, too. There's a sign posted that says "Please control your children!" I love it. Plus, they have a kick-ass temporary tattoo machine at the front where you can buy "Dogz" tattoos, with realistic looking dogs in gangsta settings. Classic.
