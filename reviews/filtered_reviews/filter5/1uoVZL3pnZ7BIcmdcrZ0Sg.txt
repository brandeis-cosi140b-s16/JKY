Came to Blanco on a whim and loved it!!! 

We were greeted by two amazing hostess Dallas and Kat. My fiancee and I had our 2 year old with us and Dallas and Kat were so amazing with her and of course she ate up the attention. 

On to our server Taj, he was phenomenal!!!! We had never been to this place and he made some amazing recommendations. We had the esquites it was a corn dish. It was to die for. 

The next time I'm in Phoenix were defiantly coming back because of the food and the service!!!
