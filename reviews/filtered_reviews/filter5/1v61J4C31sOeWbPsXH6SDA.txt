Oh my guava margarita!! We stopped by as we were leaving Fremont while showing some out of town friends around. Little did we know that were going to have such a pleasantly delicious experience. The margaritas were amazing. And those supreme shrimp tacos.........no words! I would drive all the way downtown just for a taco and a margarita. I have no doubt that everything else on the menu is probably amazing too! Can't wait to experience nacho daddy again!
