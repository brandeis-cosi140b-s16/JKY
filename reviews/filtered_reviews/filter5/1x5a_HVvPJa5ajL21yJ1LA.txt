I told my waiter I was going to yelp about my La Pinta Pomegranate Margarita today and I meant it! Wow! Fantastic job guys. This was my first visit and the service was SPOT ON and the food fantastic. I am moving away from Chandler soon and wish you guys were in Scottsdale! Nevertheless, I'll come back, if for no other reason, just to taste the great tequilas! Keep doing what you're doing.
