I came in with decent expectations. Walking in, they were lowered a little bit. Very gaudy, flashy decor. But once you look at the menu, it speaks for itself.  

The food isn't really fusion. They have a mexican side and an asian side. The cocktails are made with agave-based spirits and they have some agua frescas too.

I started with a horchata. It was good.. A little chalky compared to others I've had, but not too sweet. My friend got the mango and it was DELICIOUS. 

We ordered many small things to share, starting with the lengua taco.

Best lengua taco I've ever had. Meat was seasoned, tender and simply garnished with radish, onion and cilantro. You can tell the corn tortillas are fresh and made in house (you can watch some ladies making them as you walk in).

Next we had the golden pigs. Similar to Chinese pork buns but deep fried. The dough was slightly sweet and delicious. They're served with a side of house made condensed milk. YUM! 

The fries came next.. They were loaded with mole (perfectly balanced), crema and queso fresco. Fries are hand cut. They were yummy. A carnitas taco came out too. Again, best carnitas taco I've had. It was garnished with salsa verde and pork rinds.

The duck tongue taco and a Chinese pork street sandwich were last. The duck tongue was glazed in some delicious sweet sauce, garnished with fresh lychee... A bit hard to get over the mental block, but I still gave it a shot. The pork sandwich was very full of flavor. Chopped pork braised with 5 spice. 

Overall, everything was very well executed. They mentioned almost everything was made in house. Service was fantastic. Definitely recommending this place to friends visiting Vegas! It won't break the bank either.
