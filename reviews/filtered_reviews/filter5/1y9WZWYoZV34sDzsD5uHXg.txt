I'm Mexican so when it comes to Mexican food I can be very picky. I've been here more than several times and I have never had a bad experience. The chips, salsa, and bean dip are fresh and delicious for starters. For dinner I've tried the seafood chimichanga, garlic chicken plate, seafood enchiladas, and one of my faces the avocado seviche plate. The margaritas are pretty good too. 
Parking is tough around there but the view and food is worth the parking struggle.
