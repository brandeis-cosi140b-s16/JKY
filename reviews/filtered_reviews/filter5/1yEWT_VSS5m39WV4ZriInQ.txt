I keep coming back! 

Latest obsession is the shredded shrimp quesadilla. Apparently, there's some sort of translation problem because "shredded" means "with onions and bell peppers." In addition to onions and bell peppers -- and shrimp, obviously -- the ginormous quesadilla is filled with cheese, guacamole and smokey, bacony beans! 

So good! 

P.S. When I was there yesterday I noticed a sign that Man Vs. Food was there to eat the torta. Episode airs next week, I think...
