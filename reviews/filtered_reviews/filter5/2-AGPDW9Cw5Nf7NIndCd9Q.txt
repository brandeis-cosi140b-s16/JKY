Concur with most of the reviews on Yelp - this place is fantastic.  You definitely get unique burgers, can get sandwiches or tacos, and they also have basic burgers for a very reasonable $5.  The sweet potato tots are really good.  The milkshakes are different but very tasty.  Think of shaved ice with a lot of ice cream, milk, and a ton of unique toppings like Lucky Charms.  There are some really nice small touches:  1) They play some really good music in the place at a reasonable noise level.  2) Their have a water "jug" if you want tap water, and it's flavored with cucumbers which really makes it refreshing.

The guys at the counter have been really friendly both times we've been.  The prices are reasonable and I really don't think there is a better burger option in the area.

Definitely try this place out!
