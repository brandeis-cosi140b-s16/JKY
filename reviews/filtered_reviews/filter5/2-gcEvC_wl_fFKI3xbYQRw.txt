Wow.  I'd go back just for the salsa (since that was the first thing served, along with nice house-made chips).  The depth/variety of flavors in the salsa showed me what is actually possible in what has become more of a throwaway in most Mexican restaurants.  I can attest to the fact that the rest of the meal continued at a very high level.  We enjoyed one of the meals for two, which included skirt steak, chicken, shrimp, mushrooms as well as some chiles and scallions.  This was accompanied by rice and beans which were very flavorful, again not just the standard accompaniments as in most eateries.  Great flavors, perfectly prepared and presented.  Oh, and I should mention that the service was excellent.  We'll be back!
