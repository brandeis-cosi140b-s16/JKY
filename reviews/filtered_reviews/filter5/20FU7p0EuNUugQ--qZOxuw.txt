Finally a Mexican restaurant with Mexican food made the right way. Folks this is Tex-Mex, not the CA Mexican food like Z-Tejas serves (YUCK).  The fajitas are to die for and the portions very generous. We eat there about once a week. Seated quickly, great service and friendly staff. The negative reviews must be coming from competitors or friends of competitors because they are absolutely false unless you are a California fish taco kind of person. Seriously!
