Being originally from New Mexico, I always love my green chili! Have bags frozen in the freezer cause I thought I would never find a place that would serve it here in the Tempe Scottsdale area! When I heard about this place, I knew I had to try it out! 

I like the theme of Carlsbad! There menus are original and fun. The servers are EXTREMELY friendly and I was seated promptly, it was a group of 7. I ordered the green chili burger, it's an opens faced burger drenched in green chili. I have to say that it was awesome! The green chili was the perfect amount of hot! Then for desert I had the chocolate bread pudding! It was pretty good, very chocolaty, just wish there was some more sauce on it or something, seemed to be a little dry. But overall, I highly recommend this place!
