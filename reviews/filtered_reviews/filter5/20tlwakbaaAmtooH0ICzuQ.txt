I stopped at Most Wanted Taco as I passed through PHX to see what all the Yelp fuss is about and I was not disappointed! MWTS has unpretentious tacos, friendly service, and interesting decor. 

Walking in on a late Sunday afternoon, I was pleased to find there was no line, but they were out of asada meat. Sad times! We asked the staff what they recommended and were promptly offered a sample of ALL the meats (13 different meats!). Happy times! The lack of asada was immediately forgotten.

I ate the tinga chicken, pastor, and cochinita pibil tacos. Mr. P ate the cream chicken, carnitas, pastor, and barbacoa tacos. I added a few toppings, but kept them to a minimum to let the meat shine through and shine it did. Mr. P noted the three chilies to indicate heat on the menu did not exaggerate. Not enough heat to avoid, but enough to make you sweat just a little and crave a cold beer chaser. 

My favorite taco hands down was the cochinita pibil. I haven't found this particular pork taco in any of the taco joints I've toured to date and would happily seek it out again if I find myself in the PHX area.

I'll agree with others that noted the guacamole is a little bland. The condiments bar with sliced limes provided just the flavor enhancer needed for my tastes. 

Overall, the food was lip smacking good and worth repeat visits!
