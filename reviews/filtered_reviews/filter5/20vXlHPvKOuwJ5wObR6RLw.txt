I looked up the review on this restataunt so tried it out. Let me tell you I was not disappointed. This place was great from the cucumber jalape√±o margarita to the table side guacamole. You have to also orderer the corn off the cob. The atmosphere is killer.  Sit outside if you can by the big fireplace.
