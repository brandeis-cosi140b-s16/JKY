Very good little Mexican restaurant, located on Eastern, Las Casuelas is Arabe style Mexican. The owner is from Puebla and this style is typical for that area. My husband got the carne asana tacos and I had the verde chicken enchiladas. He said his was excellent and I agree mine were muy rico. The green sauce was very flavorful. Service was friendly and nice.
