We come here at least once a week. Jade red chicken with jerk fried rice is spectacular! 
The watermelon tea!  heaven. 

Staff is ALWAYS courteous and friendly! 


The dining room could've been a little cleaner on my last visit, but truth be told they were BUSY!!!
Also the watermelon tea was fermented, first time I've ever experienced that.
