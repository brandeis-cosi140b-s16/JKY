We went for drinks and a late dinner.
My brother in-law and I had the Pineapple Margarita.  So good we had another!  :)

The Chips and Salsa they gave for starters were good and my sister ordered a Chicken Nachos that was really good as well.

My sisters family enjoyed it so much they went back for dinner another night during that same trip.
