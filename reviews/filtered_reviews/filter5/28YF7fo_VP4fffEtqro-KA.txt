We have been in search of a great, local Mexican restaurant in Las Vegas for quite some time.  My husband has lived here for 20 years, but I've recently moved from California, which is where we would usually indulge.  After driving by this place for the last several years, we finally decided to give it a try, having friends with us from out of town who were craving some tacos and margaritas.  
The ambience is great, the service is really good, and the food was better than we expected.  My husband and I shared the chicken & shrimp fajitas, with were extremely generous.  Our kids and friends were happy with their entrees, as well.  The adults each had margaritas, which they offer in different sizes, and kids had Shirley Temples & Rob Roy's... very fancy!  
With their chips, they serve a few different types of salsa and warm pinto beans.  Their entrees are appropriately priced for the large portion you get.  We managed to save room for dessert, and ordered deep fried ice cream and flan.  SOOOO GOOD!  
On the evening we dined there, they had a magician roaming around to entertain the diners.  Initially, we were a bit put off, but he was so entertaining that we asked for his business card before he left.  
They are usually pretty busy around dinner time, so keep that in mind if you are hungry and don't want to wait.  So far, we haven't had any problem getting seated right away, but you never know.  It's not too far off the strip, so you can easily take a cab without having to pay for a drive clear across town.  
Overall, we have been very satisfied with our dining experiences here, and would recommend it to anyone wanting to try a good, local Mexican restaurant.
