Great Mexican seafood at a reasonable price. The menu is limited. My wife and daughter shared a Campechano platter (two combination fish/shrimp tacos, plus french fries). I had the Gobernador shrimp quesadilla. They feature a full salsa bar, with cabbage and coleslaw, a mild green sauce, and a spicy and really hot red sauce. They also have a  tartar sauce. All of the sauces are made in the restaurant. The food was very good and -- at this price, combined with the superb service, rates 5 stars. They also serve horchata and jacaima as well as yanqui beverages. The tacos were good; the fish breaded and fried. The shrimp quesadilla was terrific. The fries are fried very crispy (some sort of batter?) but are left for you to season.
