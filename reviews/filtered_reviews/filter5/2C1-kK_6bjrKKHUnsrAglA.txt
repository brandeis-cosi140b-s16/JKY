This is one of my favorite lunch spots downtown. The food never disappoints, but the downfall is its small and service can be really slow at times. The queso and guac are some of the best I've had. The fajitas are a huge portion that prob could feed two people. The lunch combo, which is a burrito, a taco and an enchilada, is another huge entree. The enchiladas are to die for, some of the best I've had, especially the red sauce. And my absolute favorite is the pastor tacos. If you like bold, fresh flavors, this one is for you. A close second place is the filet mango tacos. Like I said, the food here never disappoints. Just don't plan to stop in right during lunch rush because the wait times can be long.
