This is my absolute FAVORITE place to eat in Phoenix!! It doesn't look like much from the outside but inside it has style, charm, and a local feel.  The hostess is always very sweet and they are super accomodating. Downstairs is a very cool bar and the dining area and bar upstairs have a real flair!

First, you must have a bloody mary. Must. Have. A. Bloody. Mary. They are a delicious treat of spicy and strong and make my mouth water. Only my boozing grandma makes better!  The margaritas are tasty and I love their selection of tequila.

Second, the food is outstanding. They provide a partial menu from the old Richardson's and everything is delicous. They have an outstanding happy hour during the week and a delicious brunch on weekends. I always get the shrimp pasta. It is full of shrimp and has the yummiest pasta and cream sauce EVER!  Another good choice is the famous GCP. Seriously, mind blowing!

Parking is a little tricky but well worth it!
