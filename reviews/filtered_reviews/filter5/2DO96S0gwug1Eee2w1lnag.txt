ver afraid of the hole in the wall Mexican restaurants? Afraid of the taco runs? Well, fear no more! In various areas of Vegas lies a hole in the wall place called Roberto's taco shop. It's small, the waiters hardly speak English, and the kitchen is spotless.

My friends, Sheila and Kim, went to grab a few tacos for lunch. I haven't tried Mexican food since arriving to Vegas in fear of the terrible stomach pains legendary of cheap taco places. I decided to take the jump and ordered some need tacos and nachos with cheese. Being na√Øve, I expected taco bell portions. To my surprise, I was wrong.

Roberto's is a great place to grab authentic Mexican food. Shredded need or chicken in a freshly fried homemade taco shell and killer salsa verde, it was the best I've ever had since guam. Their nachos have fresh cheese melted on them, and the portions are huge.

Take time to visit the small places. Like Roberto's' you'l find amazing places to eat. I give them my personal 5 out of 5 stars.
