I think this is one of the best little secrets in Vegas, well besides the super secret pizza place in the Cosmo down a private hallway but that's for another review.
Potstickers, Chilaquiles and spicy Margaritas oh my! Anyone who thought of combining a menu of Chinese and Mexican cuisine is a genius. A perfect place if you just want to snack, or a wonderful alternative if you feel like treating your palette to more than just your average meal. Perfect for sharing with friends. The flavorful dishes will not disappoint, but I think only foodies will really appreciate this place.
I always sit at the bar in front of the open kitchens, it enhances the experience.
