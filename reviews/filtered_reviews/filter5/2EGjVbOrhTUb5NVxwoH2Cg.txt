We've been there twice in the last week, and both times ordered exactly the same thing, recommended by our server; the Camaron Poblano Asada, a Grilled steak over a poblano pepper with shrimp, mushrooms, onions and monterey jack cheese, on chimichurri sauce.   

Being light eaters, we split the dinner, and then each ordered a Perfect Patr√≥n Rita, an excellent drink.   The total bill comes out to about $50, and it's great food and great atmosphere.  Sit outside in the evenings, and soak up the live music from the cigar bar next door.

We had super service both times, and I love their light, crisp and thin tortilla chips.
