I love everything Chef Jose Garces touches. Have been here 3 times, and every time has been a little different, but always excellent. Went for a menu tasting with a magazine writer who was doing a feature, so we got to try lots of dishes. Octopus was phenomenal, tender and tasty. Duck was amazing; juicy and crispy. Returned with my wife and she loved her fish, and I enjoyed the carnitas. Went back last week with a group of seven and we shared some apps and the "group tacos" -- a nice way to share and enjoy, and tons of flavor in everything.
