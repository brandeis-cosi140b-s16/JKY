This place is the BEST. I had the $6 food special (Arepas and empanada) .... YES both for only $6 and it's really too much for one person to eat! The Arepas was authentic. The filling was flavorful (braised pulled chicken, tomato and onion). The empanada was perfect. I had the beef empanada. Did I mention they have a salsa bar. The roasted jalape√±o  salsa is EVERYTHING! The mojito was superb. I'm a mixologist and very particular  about my cocktails. I had no complaints and it was only $4 (Thursday Special). 

I can't wait to come back and try their tacos. They have taco happy hour on the weekdays (99 cent tacos). 

Their ingredients taste very fresh. I love this place and will be returning.
