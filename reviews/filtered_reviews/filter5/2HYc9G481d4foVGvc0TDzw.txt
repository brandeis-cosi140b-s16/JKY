I ordered fries, gf burger w/o cheese, and a dulce de leche shake. The fries were tasty! I am a fan of fries with seasoning. I may have to go on a heist to steal it from the restaurant or maybe just bribe the guy at the drive-through for the secret?? The burger was more than enough to eat as a meal by itself with two patties and lots of fresh toppings. The meat was well seasoned and juicy, so wear a bib if you eat it in the car. I had burger juice all over my shirt even though it's wrapped in paper. I had to hide my shirt from my dog when I picked her up from daycare. That was the best milkshake I've ever had! The catch: I don't like milkshakes, not even the ones I've made in my home, and I don't order them from restaurants. In fact, I'm lactose intolerant. However, I saw so many pics of this on yelp that I had to try it because..... Now I'm no glutton, but ever since I had that meal (which was incredibly filling by the way), I've been dreaming about going back to get another milkshake and more fries. I almost went back the next day but was afraid the guy at the drive-thru might recognize me. Yikes!!!
