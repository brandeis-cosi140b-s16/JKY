Incredible food and service. We had a young man named Jared, who was one of the best waiters I've ever encountered. The house margarita rocks big time. It was happy hour, and ALL appetizers were half-priced. We had 5 appetizers, and all were fantastic. Can't wait to return for entrees someday. Thank, Jared.

We returned as promised, and once again, the food and service was great. Lindsay was our waitress and did an outstanding job even though they were swamped due to a benefit night. Those fried oysters are going to keep me coming back. Manager was great too, explaining the benefit and apologizing.
