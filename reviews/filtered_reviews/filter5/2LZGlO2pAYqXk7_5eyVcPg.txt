Good food? Check. Comfortable atmosphere? Check. Good music? Triple check. Crescent is where you have to go if you're downtown and looking for a place to relax a little. The prices are all reasonable, and they have a happy hour and daily specials as well if you're looking for extra savings.

I have yet to see a show here, but I've only heard good things about it from multiple people so I am very much looking forward to my first time. From what I've seen on their calendar, they offer a variety of high-quality free shows as well as cheap and moderately priced gigs. Trivia night 6-8 pm on Sundays is becoming a favorite tradition of mine. Just make sure you get there early enough if you want to sit inside (I'd say get there around 5 if you have more than three people).
