This place. Guys.....this place.

Nachos. Beer. Suns beating the Kings(currently) and of course, the two and only, Grifstina power couple behind the bar. You can't beat it.

We got the Thai chicken nachos and you really have to.....Thai.....these! (Get it?!)

Seriously though, it's a great spot with great food, great beer and atmosphere to match. Wander off Fremont and stop in.
