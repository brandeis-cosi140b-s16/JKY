The best Korean-Mexican fusion in town!!!!!!!!! 
I've reviewed Komex so many times, and almost every time they've delivered a high quality product at an incredibly affordable price and the taste has always been consistently delicious.  This is their newest location and features one of the owner's as the featured chef.
