For every bad review and scary experience I have had in this crazy town I try to write one positive one to remind myself that life is both sweet and sour.  I love Paradise Cantina!  This is the ultimate dive locals bar.  The kind Anthony Bourdain would haunt.  2 for 1 happy hour and a real Cheers type of environment. Where everybody knows your name!  The bartenders really make this place.  Tortilla soup is delicious.  People I trust.

I feel my review needs an edit to call out Bartender Sean and cocktail server Heidi - these are the people that make you feel at part of their family table.  It really make you feel special and part of the family.  There are no other bars.
