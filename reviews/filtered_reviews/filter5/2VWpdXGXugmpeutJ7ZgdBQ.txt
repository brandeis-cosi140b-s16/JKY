The most delicious asada tacos anywhere! Last month we visited Vegas from Cali & tried their other location. Their tacos al pastor were amazing. I was afraid they may have tasted so delicious because I'd been drinking a lot lol. However, we went back to Vegas this month and gave this place a try. YUM! Their asada tacos are fully loaded and the salsa is delicious. They also have grilled chiles and onions. Mmmm can't wait to go back this month!
