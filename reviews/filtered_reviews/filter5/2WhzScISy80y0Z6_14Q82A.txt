So let me preface this review by saying that any place that has tequila on tap that is chilled to 5 degrees is a winner in my book!!!

HUGE selection of tequilas...and this one item on the menu that will leave you wanting more.  Queso! White Queso..with chips and chorizo.  I died.  A thousand deaths.  

The food was tasty and the tequila was icy! Nothing could be better!!!
