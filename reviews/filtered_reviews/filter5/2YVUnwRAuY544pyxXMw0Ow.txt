Delicious. Worth the drive wherever you are. I am often disappointed by an unoriginal marriage of flavors in a burger but NOT at PV Burger! I ordered the brûlée burger which is a juicy combo of burger patties, havarti cheese, bacon, red onion, over medium egg and crispy brown sugar crust on the bun. It was incredible. 
The fries were thin-ish, thicker than  fast food fries. Deliciously seasons with a salty, spicy and sweet seasoning. 

I may have a weight problem after this meal...but it was worth it!!
