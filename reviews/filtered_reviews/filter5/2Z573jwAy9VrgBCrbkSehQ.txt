What!!! This place is insane. $3 margs??? Cactus tacos??? Vegans everywhere are crying in joy. I've been waiting for cactus tacos to come to Phoenix for years now- the black bean hasn't been cutting it. I really like the watermelon Marg (sub vodka), and the green salsa. The quest dip was not good, but it was free through yelp. The corn is fantastic. The service is not very good, but hopefully that will improve with time. Will come back 10/10
