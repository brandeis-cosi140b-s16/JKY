What does 5 stars really mean?  To me, it is based on the individual restaurant providing great food, over-the-top-service, ambiance, cleanliness, fair prices and portions for the TYPE of restaurant that it is.  I feel that some people here are missing the boat with their reviews, as they will RAVE about the restaurant, food and service, but then only give it 3 stars!  How completely unfair!   So, in my reviews, this means that I could give a FANTASTIC McDonald's a 5 star rating if they DESERVED it, but I wouldn't give them 2 stars because of comparing them to a gourmet burger shop!  They are who they are, and if they do it well, they deserve the best praise.  With this thought in mind, ANY restaurant, no matter how simple or elaborate, has the same fair opportunity to earn 5 stars from me, if they deserved it.  If you understand what I'm saying then here goes my review....

Mi Patio is a mid to low price point Mexican restaurant.  Most things on dinner menu were around $7.00 - $8.00.  The atmosphere is simple and not intended for a "night out on the town".  

My ex-husband and I went there tonight.  We had two large entrees, two large size margaritas and the bill was $5.00 after our $20.00 Groupon was applied. The service was top-notch, fast and efficient.  Our waiter explained the specials in a way that enticed me to order one.  The bus-boy refilled our salsa and chips at the perfect moment without being asked.  Our food was served hot and in large portions.  In the middle of the meal, our waiter presented us with two shot glasses full of a "surprise" on-the-house-special drink that was very tasty.  When we approached the register to pay after the meal, the gentleman was very friendly about taking our Groupon and he had a genuine spirit of appreciation for us coming into the restaurant, leading me to believe he may have been the owner.    Although this was not a 5-star meal, this place certainly DESERVES 5 stars.
