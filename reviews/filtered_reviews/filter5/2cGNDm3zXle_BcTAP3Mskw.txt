By far the best Mexican food in all of las vegas. Authentic, fresh, even healthy!  I have no idea what the bad reviews are talking about maybe they need more taco bell and yellow cheese. But Leticia nailed it! Try the rib eye steak it is cooked to perfection! The guacamole is so fresh, the side salad is so alive and the margaritas are so happy!
