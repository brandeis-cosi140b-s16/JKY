This place is great. Service was awesome, nothing I hate more is rude service. The food that they serve is all non-gmo and organic!!!!! The owner came over to meet us and he was very friendly. They are even offering vegan!!!!! 
No worries about it being next to Sapphire, You never see anything going on. Silly of people being put off by that face. All and all the place is great and tasty.
