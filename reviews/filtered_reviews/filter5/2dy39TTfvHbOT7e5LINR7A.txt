First time at SumoMaya & it was a great experience!! We started with the lump crab guacamoles. It was the best guacamole I have ever had, I can't wait to try the other flavors. Then I had the sesame ginger chicken tacos, and they were amazing!! Our server was great, very attentive and was on top of our water refills. We tried two different desserts, the key lime pie and a peanut butter mousse cake. Both desserts were delicious. We sat at the bar and the chef stopped over to say hello to us and ask how everything was. A manager also stopped by and checked on us. Overall it was a perfect dinner outing! Can't wait to go back.
