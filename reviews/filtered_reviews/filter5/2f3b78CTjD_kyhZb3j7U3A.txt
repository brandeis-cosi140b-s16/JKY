This was a very good Mexican Restaurant. They had a very good variety of salsa's when they brought out the chips. I was seated right when I walked through the door. The service was really great and friendly. 

I had the ground beef taco's and they tasted amazing. The food arrived within five minutes of me ordering. I felt like i was down in Mexico. This place feels and looks like an authentic Mexican restaurant. The rice and beans were cooked perfection and i could taste the seasoning in the rice. Also, I got red chili and smeared it all over my taco's. It wasn't to hot or to spicy, it was just right. 

If I could go again I would. For that one night I actually thought I was down in Mexico getting some taco's. I would recommend this place to anyone. The culture and the food makes this one of the best Mexican food Restaurant I've ever been too.
