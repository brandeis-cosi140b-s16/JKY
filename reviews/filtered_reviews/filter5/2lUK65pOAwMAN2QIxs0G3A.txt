Went here today for Father's Day.  5 adults and 4 kids.  We all had a great time.  The food was excellent.  I always can tell a good Mexican food restaurant by how they do the sides of refried beans and rice, which were really addicting.  Everyone in our party loved the food.  I like the upscale casual feeling of this place.  It is now out go-to for good Mexican good.
