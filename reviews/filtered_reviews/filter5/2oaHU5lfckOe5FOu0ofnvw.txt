I love classic Mexican food, Javier's is one of the best places to eat original Mexican food, not water down like other places. Javier's is innovative in their food flavors as well and at the same time very traditional and example of that is the Poblano Enchiladas with Lobster meat , really LOBSTER in an enchilada? GENIUS simply GENIUS. The service was ok, the server was not as attentive as I would of hoped but perhaps it was because my party was not as dressed up as all the other people there.
