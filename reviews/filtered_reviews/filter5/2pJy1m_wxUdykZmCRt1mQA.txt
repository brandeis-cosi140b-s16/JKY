Wish this gem was in our hometown. I'm a picky eater and I thoroughly enjoyed the pecan grilled stuffed chicken breast. The carne adovado my husband ordered ala stacked enchiladas was delicious. Great margaritas. Good service. I wish I could try more of the menu but had only one night in Mesa. After reading past reviews we were wary of going but apparently others hit a bad night and/or improvements have been made. Thanks for a memorable meal.
