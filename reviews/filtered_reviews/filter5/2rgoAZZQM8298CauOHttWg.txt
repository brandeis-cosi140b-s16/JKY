Perhaps I do not know what "authentic Mexican food" tastes like but I do know what great food tastes like and this place has it! The guacamole is so good and unique... I have never had guacamole with pomegranate but Wow!  Also had the Carne Asada tacos which can be shared- there are 4 small but flavorful tacos with a good sized salad.  Small place with slightly hip decor, the service is also very attentive. When I fly into Phoenix, I will for sure hit this place... It's 10 minutes away and so worth it!
