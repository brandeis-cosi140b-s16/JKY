Can't believe they opened one of these in Vegas!  Now I love Vegas even more!  The original one is in tijuana, then opened some in the Chula Vista area of San Diegio, and now Vegas.  Bar none, the best pastor meat you will ever taste, not to mention the avocado cream sauce they put on top.  And their asada tacos get a fresh guacamole on top.  The best!  $2/taco but well worth it.
