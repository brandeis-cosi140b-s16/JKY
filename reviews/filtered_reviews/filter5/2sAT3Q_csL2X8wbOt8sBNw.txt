What a great place. For lunch, chose the Mahi-Mahi burrito with black beans and rice in flour tortilla with sour cream side.

Abundant chips with variety of salsas and different hotnesses.

Simple, fresh and tasty Tex-Mex. 

Returned in the evening for well-made Margarita. A quality margargita made with 1800 and Cointreau is $10. House margaritas are $4...yep.

Based on freshness and value, highly rate Juan Jamie's, and will return.

Small gripe:  with the hard walls, the place is noisey for a conversation.
