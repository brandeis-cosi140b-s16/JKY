HOLY BURGER BATMAN. 

I had a friend suggest that I needed to go here to try they're creme brulee burger. Now,  being a California native, I know a good juicy burg , so I am used to people telling me how "awesome" a burger is (smashburger, cough cough) and putting that charred beef on the foodie pedestal only to get knocked off and sorely dissapointed....this however is a different story. 

This burger is legend....***wait for it****....DARRRRRYYYY.  the bun , a brioche buttery soft bun, caramelized with dusted sugar , topped with a juicy, mouthwatering hamburger patty, topped with a fried egg, shredded lettuce, thick crispy bacon, tart pickled onion and finally smothered with havarti cheese. I was a bit iffy about the egg afraid it might ruin it...but out of respect for the creators concept I tried it in its original form ...and oh am I happy I did. Don't touch the idea of Changing it...don't add ketchup don't add mayo just stuff that delicious burger in your pie hole where it belongs and enjoy!!! 

Side note: this is a mom & pop or realistically two bros kinda place and I love that they are successful in this economy . Try it for yourself & Spread the word . BUY LOCAL!
