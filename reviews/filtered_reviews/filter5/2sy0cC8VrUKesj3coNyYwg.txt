PVBC really surprised me!  The menu is easy, I like easy.  The burger came out fast, way faster than I expected.  I got the bacon cheddar and it was really delicious.  They add a slice of cucumber and pickled onions, it was such a great treat.  The bread was glazed with butter.  COME ON... THAT BURGER WAS LEGIT.  SO GOOD.

I ordered the tater tots, they only have sweet potato ones and I wasn't feeling the, but my friend ordered fries and she shared.  Nice portion size and the price point is spot on. 

Drinks are cans or bottles, I prefer a soda machine or fresh iced tea (I think they had fresh iced tea, I must have missed it).

My only gripe is that there isn't a can recycle bin. If that's my only gripe, I call it a good deal. I can bring my can home with me if it bothers me.  

I'm going back, that is FOR SURE.
