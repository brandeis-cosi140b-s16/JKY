Every time we come here the food is excellent. The chef, Paco, has created an awesome menu that is organic/non-GMO with plenty of choices that are gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan. In addition to the incredible food, the staff is very friendly and the service is above par. Thanks Paco, Amber, Neil, Jesse, Enrique, Tiffany, and Rork for consistently great food and service! 

I highly recommend this restaurant!  Check it out!!
