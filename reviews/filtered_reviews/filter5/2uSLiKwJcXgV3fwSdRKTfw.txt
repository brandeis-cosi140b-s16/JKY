Barrio queen is a fantastic experience and meal all at the same time. I had originally been to the original barrio cafe located off near 16th street and Thomas and very much enjoyed the signature pork (piblis). Barrio queen however, provides for a much roomier ambiance with a relaxed feel. The guacamole they prepare in front of you is some of the best I've ever had (pomegranates included). The horchata at barrio cafe, best I've ever had. This time around I ordered the Arizona burrito, a green chili pork burrito. The tomatillo salsa verde on top of the burrito was sweet with a medium to mild heat, very excellent, and the pork was packed with a lot of flavor. The chili it was slow cooked in didn't pour out and wasn't too runny either, each bite with the salsa verde and the green pork chili was a perfect combination. Had I not been entirely too stuffed, the house French roast coffee with chocolate patron and white chocolate Liquor would have been a must
