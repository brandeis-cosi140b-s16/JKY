My god the all pastor is good here! Along with a side of their grilled onions and peppers, a meal could not get more perfect. My husband and son are obsessed with the half pastor half asada fries, they stay crispy, the guac is killer, we passed on the sour cream. Why they closed their prime location on the strip is beyond me, but both their other locations are close enough and more than worth seeking out.
Both have outstanding service, amazing food and way too long of a wait to get your food.
You really have to be lucky to find a seat here, worst case eat it in the car or outside, again more than worth it.
Prices are fair, the $10 will fill you up for days, the $2 tacos are tiny, get at least 4.
A must stop every time I am in Vegas!
