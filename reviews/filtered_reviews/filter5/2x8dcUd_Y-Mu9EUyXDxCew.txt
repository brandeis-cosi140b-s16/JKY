Unbelievably friendly staff (thanks Christopher!) and good, fresh food. Salsa medley a must have. 

I did 1/2 chix 1/2 pork burrito with ALL the fixings. So big it took 2 tortillas to wrap. Very fresh flavors. Next time I'll do chicken tacos. 

I'd recommend this spot. Definitely. Great location, CLEAN dining room, personal service and tasty grub. 

Thanks!
