It certainly doesn't have a Mexican restaurant look, but the food was superb. Gallo Blanco, located inside the Clarendon, is more focused on being a classy date night type of restaurant than a clich√© multicolored gimmicky thing, and I'm fine with that. Plus, the live  flamenco dancers on Wednesday nights is a nice touch. 

We ordered a variety of their tacos, carne asada being my favorite. We also tried an assortment of salsas and guacamole.  No complaints there either, but the green salsa was addictively good and by far my favorite. 

As you wait to be seated, check out the beautiful rooftop view of the Clarendon, overlooking central Phoenix, and dip your toes in their awesomely conceived pool. Overall, this was a very good experience, and I'd love to return to try more items.
