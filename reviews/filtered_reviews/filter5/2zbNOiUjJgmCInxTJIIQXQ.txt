Not knowing where to go for dinner nor anything about this place, a friend suggested The Rokerij to my boyfriend and I.  It was getting late and I just wanted somewhere new to go for my birthday and, wow, was I happy with the decision.  Having not made a reservation and no tables available, there were three seats at the bar so we happily sat there.  Great wine selection and beer on draft, we ordered the roasted garlic appetizer and chose our drinks and looked over the menu.  Received our drinks and placed our entree orders, right about then the hostess approached to say they had a table for us.  The bartenders had no problem keeping our tab and coming out to serve us.

What great ambiance with the music, lighting, huge couch-like booths, and the grill and prep area behind the bar.  We received our appetizer about 10 minutes later and was it good.  Salads came in good time and we all ordered the Rokerij with iceberg, fresh bacon crumbles, tomatoes, onion, gorgonzola crumbles and dressing, tasty and crisp.

Round two on drinks and a few minutes later the entrees came out.  There was also a french loaf and butter brought out.  All were very hot and smelled amazing.  Our dining companion ordered the burger cooked to liking with bacon and three sauces.  My boyfriend ordered the beef and reef with bacon wrapped jumbo shrimp, crab stuffed enchiladas with red mole, and delicious mashed potatoes.  He almost ate everything but the potatoes!  I ordered the three fish special with mahi mahi in a red sauce, catfish in a roasted salsa, two jumbo shrimp with two amazing sauces (favoring the green chili cheese) a roasted red pepper potato stuffed poblano, and broccolini.  

No dessert, no way!  Too much good food.  Perfect place to go for special occasion or anytime.  Service was great and friendly on our visit and I would love to go again real soon, for lunch or dinner.  Or maybe just a glass of wine in the basement.
