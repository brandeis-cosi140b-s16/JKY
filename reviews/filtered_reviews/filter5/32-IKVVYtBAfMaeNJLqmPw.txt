Oh my goodness, where do i even start. The steak tacos are probably the best tacos i have EVER had. The first bite and i was in love. The meat is full of a delicious, juicy, smokey flavor. Unfortunately i was only in town visiting, i live in California which means that i would have to drive 6 hours to get a hold of these tacos.
