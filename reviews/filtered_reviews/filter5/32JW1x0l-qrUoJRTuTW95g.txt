Great food every time, and even better margaritas.  My fave is the sangria margarita.  It's 9 am now and I want one NOW (dreaming of last night's dinner).  If you are a weakling and can't handle spicy food, then your options here are limited.  However, if you're like me, and there is no man on God's green earth who can kick your a$$, then come here and gobble down the adovada ribs with a margarita.  This is my go to menu item but the enchilada dinner is great too.  There are a few combination plates that are not spicy for all you pansies, but even my wife can handle the adovada.  Salsas are great too, and the clown who said the beans and salsa are not good then went on to recommend some fast food cafeteria style joints...you're a moron.

Eat up!
