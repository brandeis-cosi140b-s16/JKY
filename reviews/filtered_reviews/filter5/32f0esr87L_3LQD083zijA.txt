This is my favorite restaurant in the valley!

I have been eating at this most excellent hole-in-the-wall since 1994 - when they were quite small. The food is an ecclectic mix of Chinese, Mexican and a little bit of the Caribbean.

If you are a newbie - let them know when you come in, and they will give you a taste of the main items on the menu.

I particularly like the Chinese BBQ Pork and the Jade Red Chicken served with pork fried rice and black beans...my wife lives on the spicier side of life and likes the Pollo Diablo (Devil Chicken) and Jerk Chicken (Not quite like we've had in Jamaica - but still quite good).

Every meal comes with a fresh baked and large cookie.

It is a kid friendly environment and is full of regulars who swear by the place - we have friends who used to drive from Chandler every Saturday just to eat at Chino - for the last year or two there has been a location in Chandler so they don't have to burn so much gas.

Chino proves that a restaurant doesn't have to have any Michelin stars to be a local favorite!
