I am not one for organ meat at all.  Then again I never had Tacos El Gordo.  After years saying I would not try cow brains, i gave in because I found someone who actually sold it and I finally had my chance.  Holy smokes, it was weirdly delicious because it was delicious but it was still brains.  After being blown away, I tried the other meats, like tripas (I hate tripas) and loved it.  I recommend the mulas.  Get the mulas, get the mulas.
