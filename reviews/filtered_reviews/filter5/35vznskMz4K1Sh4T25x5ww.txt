My fav restaurant in Arizona!

Everything just works!

Do yourself a favor, call a few days in advance and reserve a table in the cellar. Dark, sexy and the perfect setting for a date. The bartender Steve is by far the best there is.

Try to arrive for happy hour and order the small plates. You wont want a meal after you eat them. $5 each during happy hour or $9 each during peak times. Also to get the deal, you have to be seated AT the bar and not at any of the surrounding tables. Kind of lame but whatever.

My dad is a big steak guy who lives in NY and gets only the best. The Rokerij's steaks rival some of Manhattan's top joints like Sparks!

Beer selection is solid, although they could use a few more draft selections and the wine list is good.

Again--don't even bother dining upstairs. Enjoy the dark cellar, dimly lit by the fireplace, with The Cure, Coldplay and other great bands rotating on the cd player.
