I was suggested Blue Adobe Grill for Mexican food. When I walked into the joint, no Mexican servers, cooks or customers! Food looked Americanized and I walked out!

I looked up Yelp and found this place. Even though it was 6 miles away, I was more than happy, that I choose to come here!!

The place has a wonderful atmosphere! Mexican decorations, music, servers and cooks! The servers where super friendly and willing to give good suggestions to food! The food was great and the happy hour for beer was awesome!

If you are looking for GOOD Mexican food.... then you want to come here! I would come again in a heart beat if I was in the area for work again!
