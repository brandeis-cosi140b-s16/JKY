Went in to watch Sunday morning football.  Husband & I are wearing our team shirts; e is a Cardinals fan, I'm a Saints fan. The minute we walk through the door he is given an update on the game.  No one there is a Cardinals fan.  Everyone there seemed to know one another and had no problem with us joining in.  Everyone is friendly. Everyone is watching all the games. Everyone there is about football.  Not fanatics, just enjoying the games.  Oh, this is a Cleaveland Browns bar by the way.  But all are welcome...just don't behave a fool. Too many fools in the world.

Food.  Now I recommend the Pozole. The best I have had in years. No greasy film floating on the broth.  Plenty of shredded pork, hominy, cabbage and radish.  Oh just thinking about it I want more!  The food is not doused in melted cheese and runny beans. This is Mexican food you get when you go to your friends house and his mom cooks.  Clean, fresh food.  

The bar, well that's a different story. But, it's a 24/7 neighborhood bar.  The decor reflects that.  But if you stop to consider its open 24/7 it's in remarkable shape.  Yes, there is duct tape holding the top of the toilet in the women's room together and some of the cushions on the bar stools are a little worse for wear, some of the table are a little wobbly and the ceiling fans outside look like the just might take flight, but over all, it's one of the best "dive bars" I have ever been.  Some of these negative reviews are a little too judgmental. Some people need to ease up a little and take things for what they are and not expect a gastro pub experience when going to a neighborhood bar. 

This is just my humble opinion and two cents is about all it is worth.
