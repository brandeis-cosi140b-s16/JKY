The food is so delicious here. I had a carne asada burrito with a side of rice and beans and a pomegranate margarita. The meat was perfect so flavorful and not fatty or chewy. The ingredients were so fresh and the salsa was spicy and full of flavor. i cant wait to eat here again. "Mexican food is life." Come eat here.
