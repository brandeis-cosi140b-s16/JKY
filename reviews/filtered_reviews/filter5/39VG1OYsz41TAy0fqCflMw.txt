Reluctant to write this review as I don't want this place busier than it already is. What a gem this little place is. Arrived on Saturday about 1:30 and the place was packed, not a table available so we waited a few minutes until one opened up. I had carne asada taco's and pastor taco's with beans and rice. Everything was outstanding and left me wanting more. We were the only non-hispanic people in the place so it has a big Mexican clientele which tells me it is good. Will definitely be back (today for lunch) for great mexican food.
