AMAZING FOOD!  This is the best place for Sunday Brunch in Vegas.  Forget about the boring buffets with their lukewarm and dried out offerings.  Every plate at BG is made fresh to order.  For the price of the average brunch buffet you can eat the menu--fresh and delicious--for only $35.99.  You can add $8.00 all you can drink mimosas (they have about 6 different ones).  Our favorite dishes were the Maple Pork Belly and waffle, the Short-Rib Hash, Papas Rajas Taco and the French Toast Bread Pudding. You will not be disappointed.
