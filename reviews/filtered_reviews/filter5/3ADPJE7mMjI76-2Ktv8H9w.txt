Finally!!!!  We have a restaurant in Las Vegas that serves wonderful Hatch chile and true New Mexican food.  I'm not talking about the bland stuff you get at so many Mexican eateries in this town.  There is a huge difference.  From the first bite I was transformed back to Santa Fe, Taos, Albuquerque, etc...  The heat from the red and green chile was amazing, so fresh, so flavorful,  (for the faint of heart there is an option of mild chile).  I had stacked cheese enchiladas with both red and green chile topped with a fried egg (so good), and refried beans and rice.    
My husband had the stuffed chile rellenos which he always loved in New Mexico.  We were both in heaven and oh, the sopas, just so substantial and yet fluffy.  For dessert, we shared the fried ice cream which did not disappoint.

My husband and I went to Chile Addiction for an early dinner yesterday with high hopes.  The food and service surpassed our expectations.  The owner and servers were most gracious and wanting to please.  The ambiance and decor was also a nice surprise.  We couldn't believe we actually found this gem.  I am sure we and our extended family will become "regulars".
