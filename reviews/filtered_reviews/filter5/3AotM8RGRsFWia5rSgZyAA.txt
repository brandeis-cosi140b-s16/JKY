Spot on service. Wait staff was incredibly friendly and never even let us get to a point of need. My friends and I Arrived too early on a Monday morning but knew it was worth the wait so we returned for our late breakfast.  They recognized us as the early birds and thanked us for our dedicated patronage by providing us with a complimentary elote. Otro is my top go-to meeting spot for friends and family. The newbies that I've introduce to their menu are always complimenting the choice.
