I love this place! I stumbled upon it when I was looking for Buzz BBQ (Buzz closed and Juan's opened up in its place). The staff was super friendly & attentive, the owner even came over and chatted with us for a little. Fresh chips, salsa, bean dip with roasted jalape√±os & onions were brought out a minute after we sat. We ordered the fajitas and they even gave us complimentary dessert (churros). SO BOMB. I was so impressed with the food quality, cleanliness, friendliness and efficiency I had to bring my roommate back the week after. They also have a great selection off their happy hour menu; I believe it's daily from 3-7PM. Best Mexican food in Las Vegas.
