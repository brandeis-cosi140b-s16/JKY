This is a yummy place to have Mexican Food on the Strip at a reasonable price.
We always get the Queso Fundido and the Carne Tampiquena (steak fajitas.)
The dinner is $18 per person and there is TONS of food.
The Carne is always cooked to perfection. Oh order flour tortillas instead of corn they are more homemade-ish.
The atmosphere is nice as you are right along the canal and get to see all the gondolas.
Check this one out if you are in the mood for Mexican Food!!!
