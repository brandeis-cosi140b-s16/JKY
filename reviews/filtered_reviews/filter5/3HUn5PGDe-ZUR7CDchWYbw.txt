This place has the best Mexican food we have had, ever, and we eat out at Mexican restaurants quite a bit. I pretty much filled up on the fresh guac (they make it right at the table -- fresh with pico de gallo and a hint of jalapeno) and the queso dip. My four-year old could not get enough of the queso dip! The best part was the jalapeno margarita. I have never had jalapeno peppers in a drink before. It was the strangest taste but I loved it-- you will want to try this for sure.

I ordered a tostida appetizer. It came with a type of cole slaw (again, weird but oh so good you have to try it!) and slices of egg and fresh avocado.  My husband had the enchiladas with three colors of sauce- red, white, green like the Mexican flag. Amazing. Everything was so fresh. The kids had quesadillas (comes with rice or fries).

Great prices, friendly staff. The food came out right away. The kids wanted to go back the second day we were in Charlotte.
