Went for a cocktail last night and left after experiencing an amazing dinner. The restaurant is quaint and romantic. Excellent music choices played in the background which added to the romantic atmosphere. The food was to die for! I ordered the Tinga dish and wasn't disappointed. Chicken was flavorful and melted in my mouth. The pinto beans and rice that accompanied the chicken were delicious as well. My friends enjoyed their meals too. One order Enrollado de Res and the other a Ropa Vieja/Tinga combination. 

The gentleman at the bar explained how everything is freshly prepared on site with the exception of the tortillas. They cut their own meat and are happy to serve those with dietary restrictions. Their lunch and dinner menus are different, I cannot wait to go back!
