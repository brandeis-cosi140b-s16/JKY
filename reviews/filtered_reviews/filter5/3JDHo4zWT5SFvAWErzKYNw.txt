Met a date there in a wed night- i was early and was greeted at the table by one of the bartenders I assume. He was like a tequila Sommelier- he occupied my time until the date arrived and offered me what I consider the best tequila I've ever had in my life- I also purchased the tequila passport.. Which is 24 premium tequila shots for $100! An excellent purchase. The salsas were great and the tacos were fantastic! Very cool building I might add-
