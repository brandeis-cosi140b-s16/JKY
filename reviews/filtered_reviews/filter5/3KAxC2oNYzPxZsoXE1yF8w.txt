I LOVE this place. I have been coming here for years and they never disappoint. The free chip assortment with your meal is always a hit. The service is always quick. The food is always done right and you can feed two people really well for less than $30. This is a win.  I can't get enough of the red sauce ontop of my burrito, so I usually get extra. Super smooth, smokey, and a nice slow heat. This place does New Mexican cuisine very well and is worth your time.
