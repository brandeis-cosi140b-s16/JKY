So I just realized there was a viva mercados on spring mountain and rainbow and I had only been there once but was sad when they closed and I did not know right away of this location!!  The chips salsa and beans to start were much better than most Mexican restaurants I've been!!  Happy hour is from 3-6 daily so we tried the taquitos they came out hot and fast and looked freshly made and tasted very good the chicken inside was very tasty!!  The guacamole was full of veggies and had lots of flavor!!  We ordered a chicken chimichanga and sante fe enchiladas!!  Both were delicious!!  Packed with fresh veggies!!  The rice was good but nothing to rave about!  The service was great!!  This is a nice restaurant!!  The decor is very nice inside!
