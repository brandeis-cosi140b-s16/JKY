This was my first trip to Scottsdale.  We went to Diego Pops on Sunday evening and absolutely loved it. The service was great, the tacos even better. It was so good in fact that I took my friend there today for lunch.  My husband was jealous so I took him for dinner!  That's how much we loved this place!  We will be coming back--just for their awesome food!
