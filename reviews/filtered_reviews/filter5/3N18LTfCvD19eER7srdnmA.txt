From the moment we walked in it was a great experience! We were the first patrons of the day and the entire staff welcomed us.  The decor is eclectic and cool, you'll want to sit and soak up all of it.  Our waiter Jaime was wonderful and helped us order. And order we did! We tried just about everything.  The street corn is amazing, as is the pork, chicken, queso and we loved all their salsas!  The entire staff frequented our table, our glasses were always full and we felt very taken care of.  At one point the chef came to our table to welcome us, she was great! She even managed to talk us all into specialty cocktails! Highly recommend this gem in old Vegas!
