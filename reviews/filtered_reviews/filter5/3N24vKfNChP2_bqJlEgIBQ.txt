Javier's is one of my favorite restaurants to hit while on the strip!  The ambience of Javier's is classy but at the same time live and full of energy.  This is a great place to go with big group to enjoy a dinner before a night out on the strip.  

Although it is quite expensive for Mexican food, I have never been let down by any dish I have ordered here.  My go to order is La Tablita (para dos personas). Prepare your own tacos with your choice of $50 carne asada, carnitas or grilled natural chicken at your table. Served on a wooden platter with all the condiments: arroz, refritos, jalapenos, salsa fresca, guacamole,
rajas, grilled green onions and your choice of warm tortillas.

This platter is enough to fill up 2 people easily and brings the cost to $25 dollars per person for the main entree.  

I HIGHLY recommend ordering some Ceviche de Ahi and Guacamole as appetizers for the table.  The guacamole is made right in front of you and is absolutely fantastic.  Javier's is known for their notoriously good alcoholic beverages as well.  My favorites on the menu include:  margarita de granada (pomegranate), margarita de pepino (cucumber) and margarita de jalapeno.  You can also order from an assortment of martinis (although I am not a big martini drinker) I hear that they are excellent.  

Be prepared to spend a bit of money if you come to Javier's an are ordering appetizers, an entree and drinks but I assure you, it is well worth it.  I am in love with the food and ambience of this restaurant.
