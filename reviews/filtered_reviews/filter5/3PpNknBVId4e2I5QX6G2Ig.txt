My Husband and I were "those people" who showed up a few minutes before closing--the website stated they were open until 11pm only to find out when we arrived that the times had changed.  We were graciously greeted, and promptly served with a smile by Luke.  He had great recommendations and the food was wonderful--we enjoyed the guacamole and the Al Pastor and Costilla tacos (yum!)
Even though at this point it was well past closing time. he offered us dessert--the Churros came out warm and tasty with some of the best tasting Canela sauce I have had.  We got a nice visit from the manager on duty who was also very pleasant and professional.  The atmosphere was very nice (even though we were the only folks there).  We loved that they had Negra Modelo on tap--bonus.  Thanks Milagro grill for making us feel more than welcome after hours.  We will be back!
