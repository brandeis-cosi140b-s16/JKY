I can't count the number of times I've been here. It is officially my favorite taco spot. Yes, it is a little pricier than most -- these are not $1 street tacos. But, the quality of the food and salsas more than makes up for it. This place has ruined me for every other taco spot I've frequented in Vegas, LA or Boston. First off, the tacos are served on hand made tortillas - not the tortillas out of the bag like at other places. The carne asada is cooked in thin steaks on the grill, allowed to get just a little bit of that char flavor, then chopped up fresh for your tacos. Served with guacamole! The al pastor is still spinning on a spit with a pineapple chunk on top. Served with a hot salsa, and bits of pineapple. The chicharron is served both crispy and soaked in chile verde - I recommend getting both kinds in your taco. The lengua is chopped fresh for your taco, and cooked perfectly. It seriously puts to shame the lengua tacos I've had anywhere else. 

Also, this place gives you the types of options you'd see at Chipotle, but with more authentic flavors and ingredients. You can get your burritos, bowls, quesadillas, even nachos and mole fries! They even have the street-style elotes (corn on the cob). AND Happy Hour specials on tacos and beer! 

If you haven't been here, you really don't know what you are missing. Make it a point to drop in, here or at the Tropicana & Pecos location. You won't regret it.
