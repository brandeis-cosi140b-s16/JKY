This place is fantastic!!!
Came here for lunch last weekend and everything was wonderful...the food and service!
The salsa is yummy and the servers don't seem to mind when you ask for more tortilla chips.  They were also very helpful in making sure that we had vegetarian food and were great about making substitutions.
Will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town :)
