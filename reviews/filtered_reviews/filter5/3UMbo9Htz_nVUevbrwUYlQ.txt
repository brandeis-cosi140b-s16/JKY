This is my favorite Mexican restaurant to go to. The service is always amazing ! The staff is fun to converse with..just a few of the staff to mention Kai Rafa Victor always so nice and fast service ! The flan is to die for and the tacos you can get on lettuce wrap ! Couldn't ask for a better service ! I've been coming at least 5 times a month lol oops see you soon El dorado! ;)
