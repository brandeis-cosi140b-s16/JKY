I want the bus boy Ulysses and my server oops forgot his name, to be there always. I'll pay em... 
This place rocks. The decor is lovely. The music is great and the initial salsa they provide is hot! Or I'm just really white.
For one I didn't order Margaritas and just focused on the food. I had Chipotle Chicken and it was the best. Superb. And though they were busy the bus boy made sure I was happy. Thank YOU!

A friend recommended this place to me and now I recommend it you!
You will love this place.
