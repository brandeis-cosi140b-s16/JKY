Very good place to eat, I don't really eat sea food but they have other things on the menu that is not sea food. The staff went out of there way to fix me something good that wasn't on the menu. They always have the soccer game on and good music playing. Plus authentic home made horchata that taste delicious! Definitely coming back.
