Met some friends here and this place seemed like alot of fun!!!  The best part is that I arrived after my friends were completely stuffed.  Bonus for me!!!

I did not have to order a single thing to eat...I was able to graze my friends plates and everything was really good.  I wish I could tell you what I ate but I still have no idea.  It is funny when you think of Mexican Food...it contains tortillas, beans, rice, meat, cheese, avacado, crema, tomatoes, onions and lettuce...yet everything has a different name.

The Chips and Salsa were also really good too but the salsa's were really spicy...I needed a beer to put out the flames.

On my next trip back to Vegas I plan on coming here and ordering dinner maybe even look at the menu too.
