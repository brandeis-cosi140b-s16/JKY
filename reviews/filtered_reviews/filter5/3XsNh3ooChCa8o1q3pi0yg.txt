This is the best non-seafood Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix region. I compare it to Frontera Grill in Chicago. Both places are great. The patio is very inviting, as is the indoor part of the restaurant. Fresh, fresh food! Excellent guacamole. Really tasty Pork in mole verde, Lamb Adobo, and polle con espinacas!!! They close the restaurant annually to go down to Mexico to brush up on their cooking and keep the menu current. 

Now - if you are not a foodie, and only think Mexican food is supposed to be smothered in cheese (like my father), don't go, because you'll be taking up a seat that should go to a real lover of fine cuisine. I have taken scores of family and friends to this place and everyone loves it, except my dad who is aging and seems to have no taste buds.  So sad for him.
