I went to Cafe Rio to get a salad to go (as I often do). When I got home, I discovered they forgot to put the dressing in the bag. I called and spoke to Chris, the General Manager, and he said he would have someone deliver the dressing. About 40 minutes passed, and no dressing. I called the store and spoke to him again, and he apologized and said the first driver got lost and that he sent another driver out with a large container of dressing. About 5 minutes later that driver arrived with the dressing. I was happy to eat my delicious salad. Then about 10 minutes later my doorbell rang again, and it was Chris himself with a fresh salad and free meal cards for me. He wanted to make sure I was taken care of and he was very apologetic about the mistake. This was above and beyond the call of duty! I applaude Chris and Cafe Rio for ensuring the customer is happy. I have never experienced customer service like that in Las Vegas!
