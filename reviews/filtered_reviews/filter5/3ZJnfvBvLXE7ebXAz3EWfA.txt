Magic  Chicken Mole (Chicken in a Chocolate BBQ sauce), best in AZ I've had so far. Ordered the Mole, Ropa Vieja (zesty & hearty) combo, wife had the Tenga (chicken/red sauce) and daughter had Camarones al Ajo (Shrimp in Garlic sauce) and our guest the Chipotle Steak. I love it when I find an unexpected gem. Bookmarked this one for a return trip.
