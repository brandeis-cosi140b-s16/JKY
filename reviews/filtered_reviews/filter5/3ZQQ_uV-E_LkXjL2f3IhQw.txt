This place is one of the very few that I get excited to be in. Not sure why, maybe its the whole hotel restaurant entrance thing or just the interior decor. It sets an atmosphere foreign to Arizona for me.
The food more than backs up its reputation. Along with their signature cocktails. I will always be a frequent customer of this restaurant. I am glad Clarendon could finally settle whatever legal/professional issues they had to have a great restaurant for years to come.
