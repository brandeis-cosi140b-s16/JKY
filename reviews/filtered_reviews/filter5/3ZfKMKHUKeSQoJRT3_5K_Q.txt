We were in Vegas for the week for my daughter's wedding and wanted to try someplace different...not a chain, not on the strip, but great none the less....we found it in Viva Zapatas!

We went on a Monday night, and made reservations since there were going to be about 10 of us.
We only had to wait about 10 min. after we got there, no problems at all.
It isn't very big, but it's decorated wonderfully and it doesn't feel crowded at all, just right.
One thing I loved is that the entire time we were there there was a 1 man mariachi playing a guitar and singing live. I don't know if he is there all the time or not, but I loved it...just added to the ambiance.

We ordered an appetizer of Queso Fundido con Chorizo in addition to the complimentary chips, salsa, and frijoles. Oh my goodness! It was the best, cheesiest, sausage-y goodness ever!

Our table also ordered a pitcher of Cadillac Margs...the "pitcher" was more of a carafe, but the margs were delish!

With 10 of us there were a variety of entrees ordered and everyone loved theirs. Mine was a cheese enchilada and chili relleno, both were delicious.

Flan for dessert topped off the evening perfectly. 

When I'm in Vegas again I will definitely go back!
