I love this place! It has the atmosphere of being in a city like NYC or San  Fran. The fist time I went there I had the quesadilla. It was one of the best I have ever had. Perfectly spicy! My boyfriend had the scallops and they were cooked to perfection! 

Their Brunch menu is to die for! and the prices are great.  I had the huevos rancheros with an egg over easy. WOW! So tasty. I would definitely recommend that dish again, I wouldn't even need to try another, I loved this so much. My boyfriend had the jalapeno eggs Benedict. The muffins had jalapenos in it. I think it was also made of corn bread. Delicious but too heavy for me! Definitely try this place out, it is a gem!
