Wow, all these reviews, and I'm surprised nobody really commented on their Tequilas... That's the *only* reason I come to this place... Their tequila selection is quite good... The only thing that sucks, is that since they changed ownership, they have been letting some of their good stuff run out....

One thing I will recommend to newbs to tequila... If you come to this place to eat, order the "Agavero Tequila" for desert. It's like a desert tequila. Trust me, you'll love it... It's very sweet. It's technically a liquor de Tequila,  since it's a blend of reposado and anejo tequila blended with essence of the Damiana Flower. It's also served chilled. This tequila is very smooth, and very sweet. A lot of tequila snobs refer to this tequila as a "Honey Tequila"...
