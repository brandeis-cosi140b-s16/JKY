Not quite sure where to begin. One of the best restaurants I have ever been to. The food,Service, and owner were unbelievable. The best trained staff I have seen in a long time. The spice combinations the chef uses are phenomenal.  This is a must stop if near here. We had everything from duck to the filet ..... Unbelievable.
