Amazing Fusion. 

When we saw this place on Drive-ins, Diners & Dives with Guy Fieri I thought WTH? But we had to try it and it was absolutely incredible. 

We arrived just before opening and there were like 6 cars with people waiting, as soon as they opened everyone went it. We went last, of the early arrivers. When it was our turn we told the girl at the counter that it was our first time there and didn't know what to get, so she started handing us samples of like 1/3 of the menu. 

The Jerk Fried Rice is interesting and works really well. We thoroughly enjoyed the Macheca and the Red Jade Chicken both as Quesadillas. They were nothing like anything I have ever experienced, in a good way, of course. The portions are large enough to share and be satisfied.

Chino Bandido will definitely be a stop we make when we travel to or through Phoenix, it's only about 10 miles north of Interstate 10.
