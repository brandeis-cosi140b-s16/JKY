I was crying on my way back from Vegas not because of money I lost but because of Tacos that I will miss so very much...
If you like tacos from Ensenada Mexico, tacos that are not Americanized, you will love this place.
When you walk in and see how your Al Pastor is being prepared, tortilla being cooked with fat from the pork, you know you came to right place for Al Pastor taco.
 
Must go place in Vegas now....I can't wait to go back there... 
Sorry about poor quality of my review.. I just can't get over the excitement of finding this place in Vegas...
