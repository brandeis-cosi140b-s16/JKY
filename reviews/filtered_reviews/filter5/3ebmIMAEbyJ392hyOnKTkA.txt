I love, love, love this place!  I would even go so far as to say that these are the best tacos that I've ever had.  The margaritas are also amazing (try the one with habaneros in it!) Also, the desserts are out of this world.  We live across the valley from Milagro, so we don't get over there very often, but if we lived in that neighborhood,  we would be there all of the time! Looking forward to the next time we go!
