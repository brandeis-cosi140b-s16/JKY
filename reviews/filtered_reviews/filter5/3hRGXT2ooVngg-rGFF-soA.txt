The ambiance of this restaurant is perfect for a romantic evening. It is not your traditional Mexican cuisine, rather a fusion restaurant. Their dishes are perfectly seasoned, and the presentation is impeccable. The servers are both patient and friendly. This is one of the finer, and more affordable, date spots for north Scottsdale.
