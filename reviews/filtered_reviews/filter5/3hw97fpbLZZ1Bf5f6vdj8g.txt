I'm from Carrizozo, NM and grew up son of a restaurant owner with some serious Mexican food game! I am an enchilada fanatic. Si se√±or totally gets it! From the acidic red sauce to the Hatch green chile down to the fried egg on top. Can't beat this place. It's my way of visiting my NM "home" without leaving Chandler.
