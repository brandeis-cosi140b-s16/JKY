Not even comparable to other Mexican fast food!  I haven't had one thing off their extensive menu I didn't like!  Chorizo or ANY breakfast burrito, tostada's, bean burritos... whatever.  Yummy,  and the service is consistently great.  Try their Carne Asada... Anything!  Lol. The local firemen are there several times a week so u know it has to be tasty!!
