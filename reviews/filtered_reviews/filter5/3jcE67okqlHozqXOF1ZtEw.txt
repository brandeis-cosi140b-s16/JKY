I'd heard this place was good for awhile now. Glad I finally checked it out. Honestly, some of the best Mexican food in town. Very authentic Mexican restaurant setting and the prices and portions make for happy customers. The monster burrito was so large that I could only finish half at the restaurant. That's a first. I highly recommend Popos.
