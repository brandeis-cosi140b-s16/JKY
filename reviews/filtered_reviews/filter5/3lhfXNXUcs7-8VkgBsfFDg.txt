I'm house shopping. It is bittersweet. Yeah, I'll get out of this dumpy area near 48th and Van Buren but after I move I'm gonna have to drive back into this depressed neighborhood. I'll do it happily though, just as one would absolve any dignity for some meth because Sonora's is just THAT good.

Their carne asada is not hyped up. People are only stating fact; it's goddamn exceptional. If you've had a bad experience here then it was your fault. That's right it was your fault. The owners are great, service has always been great, it's always clean and orderly and the food was birthed by Satan himself because it causes feelings of lust and gluttony. 

If you're debating whether you should eat here or not you need to reconsider your existence. What you do with your life, I don't care. But you should definitely eat here and you may decide not to off yourself after all.
