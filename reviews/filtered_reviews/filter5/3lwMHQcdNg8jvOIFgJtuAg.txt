Had a wonderful dinner date here Friday night. Couldn't believe there weren't more people than there were. Only a few tables were occupied. It's such a charming little place. The colorful walls and plentiful folk art create a really cool atmosphere. But it's the guitar player that clinches the deal. Service was phenomenal - our waiter was super friendly and attentive. 

Food was spectacular, from the guacamole appetizer to the Chilean Sea Bass filet that we shared. Definitely not what I was expecting. It's Mexican, but quite different any Mexican I've ever had.

We'll definitely be back. Soon.

Oh, also want to add a quick thank you to Laura R - it was her fantastic review of this place that caught my attention in the first place. It's been at the top of my Bookmark list for the last month.
