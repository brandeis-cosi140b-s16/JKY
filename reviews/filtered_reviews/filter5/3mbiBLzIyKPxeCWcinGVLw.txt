I have found my new go to spot for quick and super delicious Mexican food! The food is absolutely mouth watering goodness! It is not greasy and generous portions of meat in the tacos. I have a weakness for carne asada fries and these are the best in Nevada! My only suggestion is that the business hours were open a little bit later.
