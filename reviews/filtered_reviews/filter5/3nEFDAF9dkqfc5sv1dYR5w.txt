This is the best restaurant in Scottsdale.  I order the healthy margarita and the hanger steak every time I go, and they are both easily the best I have ever experienced.  My husband orders the scallops and we have had almost all of the appetizers and sides, all of them extraordinary.  One note, they do try to rush your experience so make sure you take your time, otherwise you will be out of there in an hour.
