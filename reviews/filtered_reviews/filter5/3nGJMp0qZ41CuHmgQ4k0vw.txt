THIS PLACE IS GREAT! The food is delicious and fresh. The family that owns it is wonderful. The place is always clean. It is a no frills joint, the classic "hole in the wall." The Torta Cubana is to die for. Their carne asada and pastor are rediculously good, too. I have taken 10 different people here in the last 2 months and they all loved it. Even an atheist would tell ya that there is a lil piece of heaven in every bite.
