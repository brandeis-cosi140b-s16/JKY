LOVE this place! We came here for a work lunch and I walked out full, buzzed, and happy. 

Order the cornbread. Order the trio. Hell, order anything you want. ALL of it is good.

Crazy note:  There's a margarita called the "Shemango" that is AMAZING. They only allow you to order a maximum of three because of how strong the drink is. I finished the first one and felt like I drank five. SUCCESS!
