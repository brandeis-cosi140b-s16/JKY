This ain't your typical peasant food, so don't come expecting beans and rice, Bubba.  Expect extraordinary tastes in every bite!  My last vist was pan seared halibut with crab, scallops and shrimp in a wonderfully spicy white sauce with chorizo nubbies.  The accompanying crispy fresh veggies were nestled in some form of whipped potatoes will give you great pleasure too.  Even the beginning tapenade with fresh bread is delicious.  Come with high expectations - you will go away very happy.
