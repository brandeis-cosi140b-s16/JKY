I loved this place. They bring chips, beans, and salsa to start, all of which were good. The strawberry margarita was delicious. But the steak fajitas were amazing. They come with rice, beans, guacamole, and sour cream. You can chose your meat and corn or flour tortillas. Everything was so good and the service was great. I would highly recommend eating here.
