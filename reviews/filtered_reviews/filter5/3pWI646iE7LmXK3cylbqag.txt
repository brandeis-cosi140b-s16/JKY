I love it!!!! I ordered the Steak Bowl with seaweed rice, black beans, grilled red and green peppers and bean sprouts, lettuce, cheese, and half mild, half hot salsa!! It was outstanding! The flavors went so well together, the steak was flavorful and tender, and the salsas were fresh and sweet and spicy. 

I also ordered the pumpkin bark, a toffee with chocolate, pumpkin, coconut...and heaven!! I also got the peppermint bark which had a light peppermint taste. Be sure to eat them chilled.....soooooo good! Military discount? CHECK! Awesome and friendly service? CHECK! Feeling we are back on the Island? ALOHA!! Thank you Braddah's!
