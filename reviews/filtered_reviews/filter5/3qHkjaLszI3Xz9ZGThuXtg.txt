We came here for lunch on our first day in Vegas. FYI, the restaurant is a lil tough to navigate, so go towards the Shark Reef sign and you'll be there.
This time, the remodeling was apparently done since last year so we got great terrace/patio seating outside.
The ambiance was great and the food even better. I tried the chicken panuchos and loved the green and red rice, very tangy and seasoned. The guacamole and tortillas stuffed w/black beans make it more filling than the plate looks. 
Didn't have the energy and tolerance to break in my first drink at 102 degree weather, but settled for the pomegranate limeade, which was very delicious. Don't worry, I met my drink quota later that nite at Mandalay Place, hehe!
But we really loved the patio seating. Great ventilation and overlooks the lazy river pool. I dunno, something about eating a nice Mexican meal while watching ppl float down the river in inner tubes that says "welcome to vegas." I'll be back, and definitely ask for the patio seating.
