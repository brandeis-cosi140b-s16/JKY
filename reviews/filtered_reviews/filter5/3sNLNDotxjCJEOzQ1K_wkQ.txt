One of my friends raved about this place as she grew up here, so we made our way on a Friday night. She enjoys the specials in the bar area, which can become really crowded and loud at times. The food and drink are top notch, and twice we have had the same waiter, Joe who takes great care of us.
The food is top notch,  I haven't had anything I didn't love yet, and my friend is very familiar with the menu and all of her recommendations are right on par. It's one of my new favorite places to go. They also have take out, a restaurant part and outdoor area. You can tell why this place is always busy, because even the chips and salsa are fresh. Can't wait to go again!
