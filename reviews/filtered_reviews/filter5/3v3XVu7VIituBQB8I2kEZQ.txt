Shady rolled into Javier's this past saturday in a warmup for a BIG nite out..Starting with a few Tito's, Shady tore into the Ahi ceviche, which packed a nice punch and was generous in size as an app. For a main, the choice was the poblano mole with flour tortillas and , like the Ahi, was well prepared and quite delicious. The bar scene was hopping, and the restaurant has a great vibe with great latin music...all in a good spot inside Aria and well worth visiting
