This is my absolute favorite Mexican place in town.  The decor is really unique.  The customer service and hospitality are top notch.  The fact that all the veggies and meat are Organic and Non-GMO is really impressive.  I like how the menu highlights what regions of Mexico each signature entree dish originates from.  The salsa trio that is presented when you get seated is really good, and is so appreciated when arriving hungry, as I usually do.  Their tableside guacamole is awesome and tastes as fresh as you would expect it to.  The queso fundido was very good the few times that I've gotten it.  I really enjoy the Veggie Bowl.  It is very hearty and you don't miss the fact that there is no meat.  I appreciate how they have many Vegetarian options and can accommodate vegan requests in many cases as well.  I can't believe they provide this quality food 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  That is a feat!
