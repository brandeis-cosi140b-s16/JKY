We came in with a large group and needed to get our baseball team back with in an hour. The hostess was very accommodating.   They took our boys order first and they were done on time! They were willing to split the bill after we ordered. DID I mention the Food was amazing! The chips salsa and beans was a perfect way to start of the meal. Will defiantly make it a point to stop by any time we r in Vegas!! Ohhhh and the HOMEMADE TORTILLAS!!! WOW!!!
