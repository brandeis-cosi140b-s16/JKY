I ate here for the first time today with a bunch of my sorority sisters. We all really enjoyed the food. Everything was good quality and the staff was fun and friendly. It's a really nice environment. The meat by itself was saltier than I like it, but once in the bowl with all the other flavors it blended nicely.

They let you sample the meat

The salsa and sauce isn't really that spicy at all so if you like some spice you'll be fine with it and it's really tasty.
