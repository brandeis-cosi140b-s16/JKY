Love it! Didn't make it for happy hour, but did get a half price bottle of wine (Sundays, Mondays and Tuesdays). Tried to sit downstairs, but it was already full. The waiter was great at running up the stairs and securing us a place at the bar. Had a lot of fun sitting at bar watching the food being cooked on the grill and talking with folks next to us. Shared the bacon wrapped shrimp (so-so) and spicy lettuce wraps (great) as well as a cheeseburger (one of the best I've had) with my husband and it was definitely enough food. We were so excited about the cheeseburger, we never bothered to check out the specials on the large blackboard (reason to return). Overall meal was great, staff (Phil at the bar in particular) were very friendly, and this place was relaxing and fun! We will definitely be back!
