This one is easy...PoPo's is the real deal, straight up.

It's been a institution for 46 years; I first ate there back in 1980.  This is classic, Nana's style Sonoran food.  I noticed that there are some reviewers here that rave about it but only rate it at 3 stars...por que?  

Heed not any naysayers. You don't stay in business for half a century making bad Mexican food in a town saturated with Mexican restaurants. 

It requires no further explanation; no "this was good but that was bland." "It's a shady part of town." "Parking is wack!".  It's a given that it's in Maryvale, the lot is small and in 46 years some individual dishes here and there are bound to be misses.  Just go there, order what looks good and you'll see for yourself why this place keeps packing them in year after year.
