Let me start with saying I'm not even a huge fan of Mexican food.  Now don't get me wrong.  I like it OK, it's just not something I crave.  My friend Bev brought me here for lunch one day because we were craving beer and a good salad and it has quickly become a favorite.  

Thier chips and salsa are so, so delicious and I'm really picky about chips and salsa.  The chips are nice and thin and arrive hot and the salsa is fresh and just a little bit spicy.  Their margaritas are top notch (my husband always gets the Cadillac) and many claim that their's are the best in the valley.  I don't know if that's true, but they're damn good.  Now my husband is a huge fan of their Pollo a la Queso Crema.  It's a flour tortilla stuffed with chicken, deep fried (like a chimichanga and topped with seasoned cream cheese & melted cheeses.  You'll be my new BFF if you'll go halfsies with me on their topopo salad and mini beef tacos.  So yummy.  The topopo salad salad is a regular green salad tossed with the yuumiest vinaigrette then topped with mixed veggies and then chicken, slices of avacado, pickled jalape√±os, tomatoes, cheddar cheese and topped with cottage cheese stuffed tomato.  And the best part:  It's sitting on a tostada covered in a thin layer of guacamole!  I know it doesn't sound that exciting or even that unusal, but it is so damn good.

Like I said, I'm not a big Mexican food addict, but I crave this place all the time.  Thier food is always really good, very fresh and never fails to please.
