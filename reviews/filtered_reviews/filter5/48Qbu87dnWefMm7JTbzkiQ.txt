Only gave it five stars ,cause there is no way to give six or seven. The best Mexican food around. Drive 45 minutes to get there. Happy hour has fabulous margueritas at great prices, and the food cannot be beat!. Even the table salsa is top notch. Can't wait to return and take someone who has never been there.
