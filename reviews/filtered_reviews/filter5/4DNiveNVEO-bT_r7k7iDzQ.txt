Of course this place opens when I move back to California. Where was this place during the four years I lived here?! Where to start. . . 
AMBVIANCE- 5 stars. Comfy booths. Great vibes. Fun place to come with your friends. 
FOOD- 5 stars. The menu is super fun. It is full of delicious drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. They have a large selection of juices including cucumber and horchata. I was in love with my almond and cinnamon horchata. You can't go wrong with their guacamole. Their tacos were awesome. I personally loved the shrimp taco best. 
PRICES- 5 starts. Prices range around $3/taco. Amazing deal!
Overall, I love this place and will return every chance I get.
