OMG the best tacos ever.  I'm just waiting for them to open up a location in Norcal.  They will bankrupt Super Taqueria if they opened up shop in Norcal.   The first time I ate here was when I was visiting San Diego and then we accidentally came across this location in Vegas during a limo ride.  Sometimes this place gets really crowded, but its totally worth the wait b/c the tacos are soooo good.  Every time I'm in Vegas or San Diego I make sure to include Tacos El Gordo in my itinerary.   There's just no other place like it.  BTW don't expect 5 star service here.  Its elbow to elbow at times to get to the front of the taco line.  Don't be afraid to call out the fat Mexican dude who's trying to cut in front of you!  If you don't say something and let him get in front of you.....you will regret it because he will be the the one that orders like 30 tacos and holds up the line.
