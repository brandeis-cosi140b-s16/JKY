Wow, Revo Burrito has the best veggie burrito Ive had in a very very long time. Yummy zucchini and squash, grilled onions and peppers all on a whole wheat tortilla (anything on a wheat tortilla I am a fan of). I did however make a few tweaks to it, I am not a fan of their creamy rice, I much prefer their delicious organic black beans, so I asked if they could replace the rice for some beans, they happily did, amazing! Plus it usually comes with rice and beans, I didn't even have to ask for double beans they just knew by the way I ordered to nix the trice on my plate, now that's service. 
I also just had to try one of their fresh lemonades, I had a mango favored one and yes it was mango-tastic. 
Their chips and guacamole are great, I love it when tortilla chips have that tiny hint of lime, its always a nice surprise. 
My better half tried the fish tacos, He seemed to enjoy them but I know he was eying my superb burrito. 
I ordered to go, and this by far was the easiest pick up of a to-go order I have ever had, they have a window right next to the front door so there is no need to even go inside and my order was ready right when I got there. It literally took me less than a minute to grab my food pay and be on my way to dig into the greatness in the comfort of my own home.
