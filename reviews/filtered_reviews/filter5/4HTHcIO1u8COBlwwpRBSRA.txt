THE BEST salsa bar in AZ. Amazing everything else, but the salsa bar alone is worth the price of admission.

Expansive menu, the kind that normally would be cause for concern. Yet, everything on it comes out perfect. 

I love the fried shrimp tacos and the carne sandwich thing [I forget what they call it now but it's NOT a torta]

The horchata is diabetes in a glass and absolutely worth it [share with a friend, or bring your insulin]
