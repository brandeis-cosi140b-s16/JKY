I loved this place! It is on 7th st north of palm lane. I ordered the quesadilla vegetariana and my bf got the carne asada tacos. They were delicous!! I will definitely be coming back and letting all my friends and family know of this place.  Really good food and really nice atmosphere, the staff was so nice and friendly. I definitely recommend this place!
