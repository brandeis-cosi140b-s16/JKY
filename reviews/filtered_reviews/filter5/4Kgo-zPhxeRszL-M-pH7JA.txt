I have nothing but great things to say about this place. It is a bit of a drive off the strip, but it is so very worth it. To start off, the bean dip and salsa were amazing and tasty. I had a craving for camarones aguachiles and ordered that as an appetizer. If you love VERY spicy chile, these will not disappoint! I ordered the tacos de carne asada which were so delicious and tried some of the Carnitas a la Coca-Cola which was also tasty. The staff was super friendly and attentive which made the experience as a whole even better. If you're looking for a delicious, authentic Mexican meal for a good price go visit Lindo Michoacan!
