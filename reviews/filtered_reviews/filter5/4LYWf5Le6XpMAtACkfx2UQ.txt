I loved the food here. The guac & chips/raw veggies was excellent. The veggie taco (vegan) was to die for. And I got two vegetable side dishes, which are whatever veggie is fresh from different local farms, and they were both amazing. The charred cauliflower was incredible and a huge hit, and the cooked radishes were awesome, too. My peach margarita was great. Love it! Great for vegans and vegetarians (and obviously omnivores -- everyone else loved their food, too -- the 3 enchiladas, chicken mole, and bacon torta).
