I would give Chino Bandido 4.75 stars. The only reason why it's not completely 5 stars is that it wasn't very clean, and the atmosphere wasn't great either, but the food was excellent. I heard it was on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives so I decided, why not go there? When I went there I really wasn't excepting much, but the service was very nice and the staff let us sample their food which was really nice and welcoming. Everyone of the options I tried they had given us was incredible. I ordered Jade Red Chicken and Emerald Chicken with a side of Chicken Fried Rice. People say it's difficult to order but it seemed like a piece of cake to me. The Chicken Fried Rice was very moist and delicious. The Emerald Chicken was very juicy, succulent, moist, buttery, it melts in your mouth, and the quality is undeniable. The Jade Red Chicken is to die for. It was very flavorful and crunchy and the meat was moist. It's like Orange Chicken but better. The Jade Red Chicken is also on the spicy side also. I also got a volcano chocolate cookie which was good, but it was a little sweet. I even got a small  t-shirt since I'm an eleven year old boy using my step-mom's name. I will definitely come back to this amazing restaurant.
