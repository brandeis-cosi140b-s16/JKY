First off: BORN AND RAISED IN TEXAS FOR 2 DECADES. I know, and love, some good tex-mex. I always go to macayo's to get my fix!! Most recently, I had an experience that I had to share. The environment was welcoming and clean, as always, and we were seated quickly. About 15 minutes after placing an order for my girlfriend and myself, our waiter, Mark, came back to let us know there was a "problem" in the kitchen, and my queso would take a little longer than expected, having just finished the first round of chips I was not displeased to know it would only be a short bit longer. Mark stayed very attentive toward the status of our order and kept us updated all throughout. The order was then brought to me directly by the manager, James, who was very kind and apologetic. I told him I truly didn't mind, he was thankful but still insisted the wait was too long and would have preferably had my food out sooner, it made me feel like my meal was actually being specifically cared for, and might I add it came out absolutely delicious. James later came back out and offered to buy us any dessert, on the house, as Mark had heard us talking about the churros when we first sat down! I was delighted to have such an awesome experience at a casual dinner. Great people, great food, practically made my week!! It was one of the best date nights my girlfriend and I have ever had. Thanks to Mark, James, and everyone at Macayo's!! 5 star restaurant service, without thinning out your wallet. :)
