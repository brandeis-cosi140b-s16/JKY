AH-MAY-ZING!!!

You know you're in a great food joint when all of the locals are swarming the place...

Also... You know its authentic when the employees just assume you can speak Spanish. Lucky for me...  i'm Cuban. =)

My fianc√© and I just had a half order of carne asada fries since we didn't want to get too full before a night out on the town. We were blown away with just how awesome these fries were. The carne asada had the most flavor I have ever! There was just the right amount of everything on there! btw... best guac i've ever had too... it was creamy and perfect... I would totally come here again and again the next time that we're in Vegas.
