Delicious!!  Lynn W and I had a late lunch here after watching a Fall league baseball game at HoHoKam.  I've been wanting to stop in forever, especially since it's so close to home.

I had the Carne Asada plate (fajitas, although nothing like any fajitas I've ever had) and it was awesome.  The meat was marinated and char grilled, so tender and so so tasty.  I loved that the peppers and onions were also char grilled, no grease puddle like other places.  The rice was flavorful and beans were some of the best I've ever had.  

I had the raspberry margarita and it was so very good.  

I'll definitely be back here again!
