I ate here twice this week!  The first time was a dry run to see if it was suitable for customers. The warm chips, salsa ,and guacamole were perfection as were the Barbacoa, cilantro rice, and any variation of the Tres tacos. The second time several of my customers at the table that had the Chili Relleno dish stated it was the best they  ever tasted- and that is a bold statement since all of us at the table are from the OC which offers many great choices for outstanding Mexican food! The Tres Leches was a great way to end a fantastic meal.
