Los Sombreros Mexican Food is one of the best restaurants I have come across in central Arizona.  This is the original location, the other is further north.  The food is very much like what I have eaten in Mexico City, D.F. down through Guatemala and Honduras - so it is not your typical Sonoran style Mexican food so often served in Phoenix.  I had the potato tacos - really small, but absolutely totally filling and tasty.  Their salsas are different than anything I have tried at other restaurants - very pleasant taste, and not too hot.  Everything is made 100% from scratch, so that makes the higher prices worth it, in my opinion.  Service was excellent.
