Hit up Roberto's for lunch on our way out of town. We now have a favorite new place to stop on roadtrips - this place was great!

The owner was working the counter so when we told him we had never been there he took the time to explain the different items and what was popular. We decided to try out a variety so we got tacos - carnitas, beef and carne asada and one beef tamale.

The carnitas taco was SO good. It comes on a soft shell taco with pico de gallo and guacamole. The meat was flavorful, juicy and crispy in parts. I would say it was the best carnitas I've found in the valley. The beef taco was also good but after the carnitas it did kinda pale in comparison. 

The tamale was also good - not too spicy but still flavorful.

Next time we head up north we will definitely be making a taco stop at Roberto's!
