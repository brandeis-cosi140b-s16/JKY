Found this place on Yelp, but I'm not sure how you'd find it otherwise.  It is in a small strip mall with a nondescript sign.  Other reviewers have accurately described this place as a hidden gem.

The food here is absolutely legit.  The carne asada done ranchero style (with peppers and onions) is amazing.  I work in Tempe town lake and try to make it here twice a week for lunch.  Try the green dip on the sauce bar.  It is made with pablano peppers and has addictive properties that must mirror those of crack cocaine.

These people genuinely appreciate your business.  They greet you with a friendly smile and are glad to help explain the menu options.
