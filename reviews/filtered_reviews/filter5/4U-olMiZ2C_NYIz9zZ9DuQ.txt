Met a friend for lunch here.  The chips, salsa and bean dip is wonderful.  I had the #24 lunch special, Shrimp and Garlic with beans and rice.  Camarones de Mojo de Ajo.  Nice and garlicky.  Great sopping the sauce with corn tortillas.  Great service.  Go here for the lunch menu, then try the dinner menu.  It's the bomb!
