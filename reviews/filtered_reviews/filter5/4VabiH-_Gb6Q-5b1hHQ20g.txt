First time ordering take out. Small place with a very nice bar area. Very friendly. This would be a great after work hang out. Ordered the Bambero, AZ Style and Pozole for my family and they loved it. Trust me they are very picky mexican food eaters. Very authentic flavors with just the right spiciness and no greasy mess. Prices are reasonable and proportions are pretty large.
