I just ate here for the billionth time. Old crappy interior that needs some serious updating (the barstools are too short in the bar, weird) but who cares? the food is so damn good I would eat it standing up if I had to. I have never had a bad meal here. Awesome tacos, tamales...appetizers are really, really good. And it's cheap. They always have some deal on drinks every day. I love this place. It is always busy so be prepared to wait. Eat in the bar if you don't want to wait. Same menu.
