After getting a sudden craving for cheese enchiladas and fried ice cream, I realized I didn't know about any good local places where I could get some. Thanks to Yelp, I found this AMAZING LITTLE GEM. The service is friendly and prompt, the food is *delicious*. The fried ice cream was so fresh and flavorful! A++, would eat again. 

Seriously, this place is my new favorite Mexican spot.
