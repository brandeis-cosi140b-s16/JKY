Been wanting to try this place since it opened and so glad my Hubby and I went tonight! 

The building is so cool to sit there and look around as you are eating. We loved looking at the old stain glass windows and then talking with our Server about the history of the building. 

The food was amazing. The chips were fresh and warm. My hubby is a super picky eater of tacos and he LOVED them! We each tried three different tacos! The Lamb taco was by far my favorite while my husband loved the two different pork tacos they offered! And the margaritas were pretty tasty as well!  

Our server Mike made the whole experience even better. He was very helpful with everything on the menu and he was probably one of the best servers we've ever had. 

I think we found our new favorite restaurant!
