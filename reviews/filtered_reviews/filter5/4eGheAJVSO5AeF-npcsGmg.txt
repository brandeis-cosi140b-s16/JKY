Wow! What a find...
Me and my wife were looking for good Mexican food to try in the Charlotte area. So far, this place is close to what we got in California. 
In CA, there are burrito places all over.
I am jaded about my Mexican food being up to par.
The quality of service and food were top for what you pay.
Our waitress, Rafaela, was very cool and hooked us up!
We will definitely be back soon!!!!
Thank you.
