The Rokerji, similar to Dick's Hideaway in that they make you feel like a regular even on your first time.  While packed after work hours, it's worth the wait, even if you just get a seat at the bar.  The ceviche is a good snack while bellied up the bar, but almost like a salsa dip vs most other ceviche's I've had.

The Surf and Turf has to be the best value on the menu, if you're a business dinner or casual night in Central Phoenix the Rokerji is a can't miss.
