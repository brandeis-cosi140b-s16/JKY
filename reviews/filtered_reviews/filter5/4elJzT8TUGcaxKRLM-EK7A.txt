We have been here a few times before and just realized ive never left a review for them.  This place is truly a diamond in the rough for Scottsdale hidden on Scottdale and Shea. 

The salsa Is flavorful and fresh, sooo good. My favorite is the chicken fundido, highly recommend. I posted a pic too.  Staff is attentive and at 6:30 there are few booths available,  don't let that discourage you.... Just tells you its great.

I know another post commented on the ventilation,  no idea wth they are talking about. Place does not smell, it's old but it's clean. Try it... It's worth my 20 min drive!
