On Saturday and Sunday they offer a brunch Buffett which is amazing.  This place is a must try if you like Mexican food.  Included with the buffet is all you can drink margaritas or another selection or 2.  

This place is really great anytime but for a buffet it blows the casino's away.  Fresh made to order quesedias as well as a few other items.  This is a must try place.
