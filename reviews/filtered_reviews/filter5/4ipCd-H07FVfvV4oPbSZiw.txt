Since moving to the east valley in 2011 we haven't found a GOOD mexican restaurant...until now!  We love this place from chips & salsa through dessert.  My wife considers their tres leches cake one of the best desserts she's ever had.  Our server, Spike, recommended fabulous and reasonably priced entrees in addition to the aforementioned dessert.  No more searching for great Mexican food...it's Abuelo's for us from now on.
