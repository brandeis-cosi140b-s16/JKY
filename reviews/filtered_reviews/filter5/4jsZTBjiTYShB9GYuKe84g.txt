Okay, this place is one of the best restaurants I've been too. Probably the best tex-mex/mexican food I've ever had. I lived in Charlotte for a year and when my family came back to visit, this was the first place we ate dinner. The service is really good and the food is amazing. I had the enchiladas suizias, and they were amazing! You actually get a lot of food for the price. You will not go home hungry. But, if you do have room dessert, you have to try one of them. Nutella pie is to die for!!!
