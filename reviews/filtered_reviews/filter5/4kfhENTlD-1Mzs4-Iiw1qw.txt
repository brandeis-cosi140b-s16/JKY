Paradise Cantina has been one of my favorite bars in Las Vegas since I moved here close to 9 years ago.  All drinks are 2 for 1 during Happy Hour which is daily from 4 pm - 8 pm. You really can't beat that deal!  The bartenders and waitstaff are friendly, the food is good and there are a ton of TVs so it's a great place to watch a game. It's also very close to the Thomas & Mack Center so it's a great place to stop at before or after a UNLV game or other event at the Thomas & Mack.

Paradise Cantina is centrally located in the valley and not far from the strip, so it's great for both locals and tourists.  I would recommend this place to everyone looking for a fun bar with great drink specials!
