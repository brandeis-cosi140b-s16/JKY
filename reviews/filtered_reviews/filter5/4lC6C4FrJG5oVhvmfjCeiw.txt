My husband and I came here for lunch and had a very nice experience. 

The chips and salsa were delicious.  I ordered the blackened shrimp lettuce wrap and it was a nice light but filling flavorful lunch.  My husband got the enchiladas and also really enjoyed them.

Our waiter, JR had a very fun personality and provided great service!

Nice atmosphere and reasonable prices.  

We will be coming back!
