This place was very good last year and stepped it up to great a year in.  Let's start with the service - outstanding top to bottom.  Our server Heather was just great.  Prompt, fun, and spot on with descriptions and recommendations.  Didn't hurt getting us a free app for being repeat customers.  Seviche here is top notch in my opinion.  No bad options yet.  So very fresh.  This time I had the chicken enchaladas.  I'm not really an enchilada fan but these were very well prepared and flavorful.  Better half had the skirt steak.  Very tender and seasoned well.  Made ourselves sample a dessert and tried the rice pudding.  I thought I'd just sit and watch the better half enjoy it bit was so tasty I had to jump in.  Fun, clean atmosphere with fresh and tasty choices.  Give them a try.  Note:  first Forum Shops entrance when coming from Mirage.
