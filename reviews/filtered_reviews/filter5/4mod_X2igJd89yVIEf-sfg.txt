I am giving this place 5 stars. The margaritas with a pomegranate floater was so delicious that I had to have another. I had the Mole tacos that are one of the best things I have ever tasted. The waitress was super helpful and friendly. I will be back for more. This place is tasty with a sexy ambiance.  Love it!
