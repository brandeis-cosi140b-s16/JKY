Holy COW! This place is awesome. Off-the-beaten-track AUTHENTIC Mexican food. The owner and his wife cook and serve the dishes; all originating from their hometown of Puebla, in Southern Mexico. Prices are low, low, low, comparable to Mexican "fast food" joints like Roberto's and Fausto's, but without the canned ingredients or processed cheese. 

I had the Chanclas- shredded marinated chicken on boletto buns with fresh sliced avocado and onion in a charro broth. DELISH!

My husband had the Huevos Rancheros and a Taco Oriental. He claimed his meal was heavenly and was so good that he ate it up, before I got a chance to have a taste!

They give you free chips and salsa, if you dine in. The salsa was GREAT! Not too spicy and very refreshing. 

Then the owner let us sample the Flan for dessert. My goodness! It was like I stepped back into my grandmother's kitchen. The best Flan I've had since I left New York City, eleven years ago.

We will be coming here again and again!
