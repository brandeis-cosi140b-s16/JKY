Great food. Thank god I like it spicy. I took some home to some kids not considering the spice level and they said it was too hot. So be mindful of that. I ordered the fusion nachos, burrito, 3 tacos each with a different meat, a lettuce taco with kimchi and vegetarian noodle dish. Because I was traveling, sharing and heard it was cheap. My favorite was the burrito, then the nachos. It was all good but I didn't care for the noodles (just me). The only thing that bugged me was the waitress kept wiping sweat off her brow and I was hoping she was catching all of it. I hope someone recommends her to wear a sweat band like the tennis players do.
