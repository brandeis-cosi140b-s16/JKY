For starters, the guacamole is amazing, I get it with pumpkin seeds and  crab...so so so good. I have also worked my way through all the tacos, the carne asada, shrimp, puerco verde, and beef barbacoa are favorites, the verde one has pork rinds, and the barbacoa is in a crunchy shell and has mashed potatoes in it.....MASHED POTATOS...this fat kids dream of course. Another dish i love are the Sopes, i cannot describe them, but they are amazing. For dessert, do yourself a favor...get the churros.....the best i have ever had! It comes with 2, they have this caramelly goodness or something in the middle and chocolate dipping sauce....just order them.

Im not a huge beer person but they have quite a selection, the bartenders were awesome, we come on Friday nights and Stephany and Garick are behind the bar, they are so much fun. The hostesses and servers are always so nice.
