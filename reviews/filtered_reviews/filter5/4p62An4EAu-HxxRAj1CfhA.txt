I went for brunch last Sunday - after seeing the wait over at the Flying Biscuit - I am SOOO glad we did! 
This was our first visit to their new location. At first, we weren't sure they were open, even though Yelp said they would be - there were few cars and no one visible from just outside the door. We went in anyway and there were only 2 parties in the joint. After just a moment, someone came to the front and seated us in our own section.
I was not expecting the 5-star experience we had after that initial feeling of "should we do this?"

I didn't see any booths and the place has an open layout - so I can imagine it being noisy as other posters have stated....but at breakfast, it was nice and quiet.... once lunch time started in earnest toward the end of our visit, the kid-noise-level increased. (note - it is never acceptable to allow your child to run around a restaurant screaming.)

It was nearly 10:30, so the server said we could choose either brunch or lunch - and when I indicated brunch - he walked me through some of the specialities on the menu with such passion, I wanted to order everything. I have to go back to try  2 of the recommendations - but this first time, I really wanted Huevos Rancheros. We were given a bowl of chips and salsa and our coffees. Odd mix, but in the spirit of being at a Mexican restaurant on a Sunday morning, it worked. 

I loved the huevos rancheros and will have to struggle very hard to order something else on my next visit. If you're not familiar with the dish - it is basically 2 eggs over a quesadilla with black beans. Sounds plain - but chefs will create all sorts of rifs on the sauce, the cheese, the other add-ins, and 1511 does it perfectly. The ranchero sauce was delicious, the black beans were perfectly done. 
I can't wait to go back and try the Avocado Bake! And the benedict. If you and I are friends and you want to go one weekend, just let me know!
