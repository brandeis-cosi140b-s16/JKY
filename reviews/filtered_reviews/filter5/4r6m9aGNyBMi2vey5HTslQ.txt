First off, let's clear the air. Don't judge this El Bravo by the El Bravo at the airport. Though I'm pretty sure they are related, they aren't working with the same facilities down there at Sky Harbor. For the real thing, head north on 7th street past Northern and keep your eyes peeled; it'll sneak up on you. 

It was expanded in the past year or so but I love how intimate and beautifully tacky this place is. You walk in to Magic Eye posters lining both sides of the restaurant, along with an oversized mural of mustachioed mariachis. As you can probably already tell, this place is not to be missed. 

I am loyal to the flauta combo meal, for one main reason: guacamole.  No frills, no BS; just guac for guac's sake. Heavy on the avocados and lime juice, and perfectly salted. I love avocado and tend to get frustrated when there are too many detractors that take attention away from them. This guacamole uses the perfect mix to highlight the avocados and accentuate them just enough. 

Bottomless sodas are necessary with the outrageously amazing sodium intake, and they have great soda there. Just the mix is right, I guess. 

I love El Bravo.
