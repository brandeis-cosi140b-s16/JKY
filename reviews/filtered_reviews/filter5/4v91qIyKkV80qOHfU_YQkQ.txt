Green chile, green chile, green chile!!! Need I say more. There was a line out the door when I arrived at 2 pm on a Saturday. They moved through it very quickly, however. This a very low key joint, the food is fresh and delicious. I got a chicken chimichanga with green chile on top. This smothered delicacy almost forced me to take a nap before driving home. I paired it with some horchata, which came from a fountain, but was surprisingly palatable. The price was about $9 for a meal and a drink. And one order of chips is enough for 3 people to share.
