There are very little Mexican restaurants in Hawaii, so I really didnt have much experience in the way of Mexican cuisine other than tacos and such.  Anyway, got recommended this restaurant by family, and it was great.  

The ambiance is clearly not some people's forte, but to me, it was casual, fun and just plain worked.  

We had a party of 11, so we expected a longer wait than normal, but truly, the wait wasnt that bad, maybe 30min.  And as a walk-in at 6pm on a friday, thats pretty good to me.  

The food (carne asada) was great.  Flavor, appearance and aroma was just excellent.  My uncle swears by the shrimp tacos though.  The chips were just heavenly, we all almost filled up on chips and salsa before the food got to us.

Their Customer service is not really much to brag about, but its not bad, so I dont mind.  The seem to try to do their best with the amount of customers and noise that they have.
