I am reviewing Guadalajara's after eating here for the third time. I'm from out of town and my father-in-law turned me on to this place. It was one of his favorites. The food here never disappoints. You can taste the passion in every bite; especially in the salsa which is just the right amount of hot and blowing up with flavor. My only regret is that it was too early in the day to enjoy one of their tasty margaritas. I guess we will need to go back soon.
