I absolutely love this place! The atmosphere is great, the staff is very friendly, and most of all, the food is amazing! Coming from Hawai'i, my mom, aunt, and I decided to dine here our first night in Vegas. We started off with a few Cucumber Jalapeño Margaritas and some Guacamole and chips. The Cucumber Jalapeño Margarita was so refreshing and tasty. I've never heard of such a drink, and I'm glad we tried it! The Guacamole was also very creamy and refreshing, just to my liking. Then, amongst the three of us, we decided to order the Sea Bass and the Shrimp Relleno. The food is fresh, tasty, and pretty inexpensive if you ask me. Great, quality food without emptying your wallet! When I do return to Vegas for a visit, I'll be sure to visit YOLOS at Planet Hollywood.
