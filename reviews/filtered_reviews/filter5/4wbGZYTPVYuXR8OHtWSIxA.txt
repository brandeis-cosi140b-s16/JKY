Such an amazing experience! The staff was pleasant efficient and helpful. The atmosphere was great and the Food was delicious. We had the sea bass which despite the cilantro jalapeño marinade was very mild and cooked perfectly. The pork loin was cooked to perfect as were the pork chops that were on special. The sautéed spinach was fantastic and the Mexican risotto was a fun twist. We will definitely be back!!
