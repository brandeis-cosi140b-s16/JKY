I live in summerlin so this place is a little out of the way but way worth the trip. The pablano stuffed with shrimp is so damn good! I wanted to take a whole other one home to eat later.  The salsa's here are authentic and have just the right kick.  Gustavo is an absolute gentleman and makes you feel like you are eating at his home.
