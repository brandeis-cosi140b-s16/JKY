We stopped by for lunch on a late Saturday afternoon. It was still a little busy from it being opening week, so there was a bit of a line. The staff was quick though, so the wait wasn't too long.

The decor is like every other Cafe Rio out there. Vibrant and friendly. A comfortable fun place to have a meal.

The staff is fast and friendly. The menu takes a little getting used too, but the staff are helpful.

We ordered a sweet pork barbacoa enchilada plate and a sweet pork barbacoa burrito plate. Both with mild sauce. The food was delicious. It was hard to stop eating my burrito even after I knew I had eaten too much. The burrito plate is large and could feed two people (maybe).

We will definitely be back (repeatedly) to try out all of the other dishes.
