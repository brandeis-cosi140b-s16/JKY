Joyride is a perfect combination of delicious food, awesome decor, good service and, if you'll excuse the hippie descriptor, "good vibes".  It's cool to see so many people's bikes (think beach cruisers, fixies and Schwinns...not Harleys) outside the restaurant. The restaurant opens almost completely to the outside patios so that the indoor/outdoor feel on a perfect Arizona evening is obviously only going to enhance your experience. The agua fresca I had was delish and we tried a sampling of tacos, appetizers, sides and dessert all of which met or exceeded expectations. The prices are great as well. Of note, the guac is on point, the battered fish taco is tasty tasty and the mandarin and cucumber side salad is bomb.com (who'da thunk?) Shout out to our excellent waiter Justin who was enthusiastic, efficient and most importantly, very nice! Joyride was indeed a joy.
