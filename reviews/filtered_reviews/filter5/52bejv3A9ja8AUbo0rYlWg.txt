On my first visit I had the Fusion Burrito and my sister had the Fusion Chimichanga (basically my burrito fried).  We were such fans we went another day during our weekend visit in Vegas and this time I tried the Fusion Flautas and she again got the Fusion Chimichanga.  

My only regret is that I didn't order myself the Fusion Chimichanga to go.  I'll be going back for that next time I'm in town.  Huge fan of this spot!
