The rumor is still true. tacos are better closer to San Diego and Mexico. 

As I'm pretty sure, Tacos El Gordo started in Mexico, then opened in Cali, and then opened in Las Vegas. So you're welcome Las Vegas, you now have a piece of Mexi/Cali authentic Tacos El Gordo that is still amazingly delicious to enjoy.

I've been to the one in Vegas and Chula Vista, as far as I can tell both are awesome.

All you need to know is adobado tacos and adobado fries. friggggin bomb.
