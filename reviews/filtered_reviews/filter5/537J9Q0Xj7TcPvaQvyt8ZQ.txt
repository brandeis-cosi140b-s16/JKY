Burritos and tamales and tacos, oh my! There's no place like home... Unless you happen to be close to Carlito's Burritos, then home is close to you. Mexican food can be had anywhere, but true New Mexican food is much harder to find outside the state. Carlito's is THE REAL DEAL. Chile like my mom makes, tamales that would have made my grandmother proud! There's something for everyone in Las Vegas, for me there's Carlito's.
