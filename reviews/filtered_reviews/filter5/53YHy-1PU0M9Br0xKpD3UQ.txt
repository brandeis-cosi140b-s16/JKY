Most amazing guacamole I have ever had in the most vibrant restaurant I have ever seen. Color, energy, and fun pop from wall to wall. Even the servers jump out of the blue swiftly and like old friends, who happen to be Ã¼ber knowledgeable about the menu.

The ceviche's shrimp was cooked perfectly to retain its soft texture and natural juices. The whipped avocado (and what tasted like wasabe cream) made the dish.

The fish tacos are a work of art but not exactly a cure for the fish taco urge. The fresh mahi comes wrapped in a plantain layer and is then fried to golden perfection. The result is an almond roca like mini log of fish. This technique apparently traps the essence of fish better, because you really taste the clean flavor of the mahi, an experience rarely had because other chefs burry the fish in cream sauce. Here, the freshness of fish emerges from the fun sized fish stick only to be tempered by the pickled cabbage. The harmony of the mahi and pickles reminded me of sushi and ginger.

I'd say this is a "must see" for all old town visitors.
