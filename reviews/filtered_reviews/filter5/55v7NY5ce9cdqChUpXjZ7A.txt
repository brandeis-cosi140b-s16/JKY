In my never ending quest to find the best mexican food in the universe I came across this lovely little colorful gem in central Phoenix. Warning, the color scheme in this place may cause seizures, minor heart explosions, massive weight gain, restless torso syndrome and restless leg syndrome.
First off you know you're in the right place where you wonder if you're car is safe to park there. You walk in and a complete array of colors hit you, leaving you breathless, speechless and eventually i'm sure sightless. The food and margeritas were amazing. Shrimp Cerviche was to die for. It was delicious and I have to honestly say that although my quest to find the best mexican food in the universe will never be complete, this is my favorite place for shrimp Cerviche so far.
