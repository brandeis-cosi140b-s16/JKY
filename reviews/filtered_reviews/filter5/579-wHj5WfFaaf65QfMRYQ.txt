This is one of my favorite places! My sister and I go every Tuesday and get the same server, Danielle. She's the sweetest girl and she knows what we want before even asking us! The managers even know us by name! I would recommend this place to everyone. Foods great, service's great, management's great. Just an all around awesome place!
