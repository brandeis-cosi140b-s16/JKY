If you want a real Mexican Taco, this is the place to go.
Tortillas pressed out in front of you, meat simmering in different pots, and a warm welcome by the staff.   A humble business with authentic flavors, the best of Las Vegas has been found!!!!  I had four tacos, I couldn't stop ordering them.  They have pork belly, pork al pastor, pork shoulder, beef steak, beef head and beef tongue, the accompanying sauces were phenomenal...avocado sauce, salsa verde, chili verde and more.  This is a must visit any time you are in town.  If there were a sixth star they would get it.
