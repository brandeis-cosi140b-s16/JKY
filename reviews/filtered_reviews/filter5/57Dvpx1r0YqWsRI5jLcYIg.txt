This place is mother f'ing good. My hubby hates tortillas ("they taste like soap" ??) but he fell in love with these. The guy was SO nice and helped us decide what to get. Murals and futbol on TV make the ambiance really fun. It's a small place so go on an off-time or get the food to-go.

Be careful and dodge the crack-heads on the way from the parking lot to the front door!

It was the Yelp app that led is to this place as we were passing through on the way to the airport. THANK YOU YELPERS!!!
