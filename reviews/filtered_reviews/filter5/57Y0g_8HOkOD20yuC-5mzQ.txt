Love love love  love, LOVE Cabo Wabo. Make a special trip every year to the Tahoe location for my birthday. I've been to the Vegas location once before and wasn't overly excited. But this last trip, once again, made me fall in love all over again! I eat nachos ONCE A YEAR and Cabo Wabo is my only choice. The server suggested shrimp on my nachos. Freaking amazing. Great margaritas too. Good Service. Really nice patio with great people watching. Can't wait to go back. Counting down. Oh, and strangely enough, my boyfriend tried their burger (I know right, burger--at a Mexican restaurant?) and said it was to die for!
