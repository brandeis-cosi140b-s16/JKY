This place has been on the radar for some time, we just haven't had time to try it. Today we managed to compromise, I'd eat nachos and my husband would eat his favored "plate lunch". 

We arrived for I thought a late lunch, around 145pm, but found a line almost out the door and hardly a seat in the place wasn't occupied. I stood in line studying the menu and when it was time to order I had added the Navajo taco to my original craving of nachos. 

I was surprised to see fry bread on the menu, and quite pleased when my order was ready. The Navajo Taco was a fry bread topped with pork Verde or carne adovada, cheddar, lettuce, and tomatoes, I choose the pork verde, boy was it delicious, soft almost falling apart before I had a chance to chew it. It was just spice enough not to cause a sweat. 

My order of nachos was just the usual, they put the beans and cheese, cheddar & jack, on the bottom as well as throughout the chips, then layered with olives, scallions, tomatoes, green chile, jalapenos, sour cream, and guacamole and I added beef. It was a really good nacho! 

Even though my husband was going to eat a plate lunch just up the street, he couldn't resist what was before him and I think he ate as much as I did, it was a really good lunch. I will be back to try other items I spied on their menu.
