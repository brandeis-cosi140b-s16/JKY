Really excellent.  When you sit down, they bring chips and salsa, and the salsa is outstanding.  The chips are fresh, crispy and have that great Mexican-oil flavor.

I had and enchilada and a taco.  Both were very flavorful and authentic.  The refried beans were a bit bland, but they were a perfect temperature and consistency.

The crew there is extremely friendly and attentive (unlike Hertz). 

I highly recommend this place.
