By now, you've probably heard of El Dorado Cantina -- if not, allow me to get you acquainted....

IT'S GOOD.

How good? I don't know. I can't really say. I didn't grow up in the Bay Area or Southern California. I grew up in Northwest Indiana. We didn't have the best Mexican food -- although Chicago has some quality spots. 

All I know about El Dorado Cantina is they do Mexican food about as good as I've ever tasted. 

Every dish I've had (from the stuffed shrimp, Siegel plate, fajitas, table-side guac, and habanero salsa *ask for it*) is bursting with unique flavor. All of the food is organic and non-GMO. The farms from which they source are listed on the menu. 

In my opinion, EDC does everything right. They're the future of what a successful business should be: quality, honesty, good customer service, and fair (somewhat) pricing. 

If I could give them six stars, I would. One of the best places to eat in all of Las Vegas.
