I've been selfishly reluctant to give a review on this hidden gem in OldTown, as to not alert the masses. Quite possibly one of the best burgers I've ever ordered and certainly one best you'll find here. 
I'm always torn between the Green Chili Burger and the Patty Melt, they're both so damn good! If you're feeling squirrelly, double down on either with a 2nd patty. 
They serve breakfast all day, too, which is pretty bad ass and more places should do this. 
It should also be noted that they make one amazing Peanut Butter Malt / Shake.
