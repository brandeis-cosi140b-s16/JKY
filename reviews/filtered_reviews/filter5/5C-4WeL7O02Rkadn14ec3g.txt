I won't beat around the bush. This was hands down the best Mexican food i've had in Phoenix so far. The salsa bar was incredibly varied and interesting, the street tacos at happy hour were delicious, the house margarita was perfectly balanced and the handmade quesadilla destroyed any preconception I had of what a quesadilla was supposed to be. Highly recommended. On top of that, staff was attentive and the atmosphere was unique, and unpretentious.
