Always a good meal at Pepe's.  Good authentic Mexican taqueria.

They have a fresh salsa bar with a tasty red hot sauce and a green one.  Plenty of fresh cut lines, radishes, and pickled jalape√±os.  

The tacos come with a healthy portion of meat.  They have a lot of choices...  We always order the carne asada (steak) and al pastor (marinated pork).

They recently added carne asada fries which was really good.  Think nachos but with fries at the bottom instead of tortilla chips. 

I've had better tacos in LA, but so far in Vegas this is our spot.  I've been to a few of their locations and sometimes the neighborhood is dodgy, but the restaurant is always clean and safe.  One time I talked to the owner, Pepe, and he said he doesn't sell beer because he wants his restaurant to be family friendly.
