We tried Sol for the first time last night and it was EXCELLENT.  The watermelon margarita was easily the best I've ever had and their carne asada street tacos were divine.  Mmmm my mouth is watering just thinking of it. My husband had the viper and vampiro tacos and loved every bite.  Service was great. Overall, a fantastic experience. We will definitely be going again soon.
