After hearing about this place for months, I decided to give it a go. Just after 2 times, I can say that this spot will become a regular for me. Quality and anything that wont break your wallet is what I like to eat! The quesodillas are a little better than the burritos. They are flawless! And the margaritas are good as well! Decent beer options as well! Will be back numerous times!
