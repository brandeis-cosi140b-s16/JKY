I Love this place! The hookah is amazing, and the staff is very friendly, professional,and attentive. The outside area was really nice and everything was very clean. Everything was on point, especially the food. I had the Pelmeni which couldnt have tasted better. Overall,  i was really satisfied and i shall be going back soon for Karaoke!
