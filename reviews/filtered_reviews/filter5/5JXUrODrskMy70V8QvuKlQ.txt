mi patio no tienes el patio? muy confusing! 

both times i have been here, i ordered the mix fajitas. i am in love with the owner, john. he makes me so so happy!!! when i come in he shouts SAH MAN TAH!!!!! or, actually probably not my name but he is shouting something that makes me feel like we have been best friends forever.  

the food is excellento. the salsa is the bomb. our waiter sucked but john makes up for it. i love john. the food is reasonably priced and it's open on sundays! 

i love mi patio!
