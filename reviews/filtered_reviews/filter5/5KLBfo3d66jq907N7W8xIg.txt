We had heard great things about The Mission and assumed it would not live up to the hype. As soon as we dug into the grilled street corn, any doubts were allayed. In addition to the corn, we shared the crispy pork appetizer and two taco platters (skirt steak and butternut squash). Each bite left us wanting more. While the entrees are on the expensive side, the appetizers and tacos are reasonably priced. The table-side guacamole looked amazing and will be a must on our next visit.
