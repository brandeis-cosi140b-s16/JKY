The Mission is brought to you by the same people as House Brasserie and it shows! 

The tableside guacamole is unbelievable.

Anything involving the pork shoulder on the menu is a winner. They slow roast it for 12 hours and it's somewhat of a signature.

The white bean pur√©e side is absolutely fantastic, must get it.
