Drove past this place a couple of times decided to finally try it out. I'm so glad I did. Cashier was extremely nice gave me and my friends chips and salsa while we waited for our food. They normally charge for them but they gave it to us for free. The food was amazing we all got a different type of burrito and all of us loved our burritos. I highly recommend this place
