Location is amazing.  Decor is great.  Food is amazing as well. Be sure to try the mussels I couldn't get enough of them. No better place to watch a game on the weekend while kicking back having a beer with friends. When the weather cools has to be one of the best patios in the valley.  Bravo Sandbar job well done!!!
