A refreshing new spin on Mexican food, I love salsa and they had plenty to choose from. This place stands out , and is unlike most Mexican food. Nothing drowning in cheese or overly oily. The flavor's were unique and on point. Guacamole was awesome too. Our server was very friendly, and she was quick to check up on us. The outside setting is very beautiful as well.  Will definitely be back !!!
