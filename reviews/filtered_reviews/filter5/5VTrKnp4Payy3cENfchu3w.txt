This place is so legit! Where to even start... Umm top 3 best carne asada burritos I have had. My fave used to be Carolinas... not anymore. Owner is almost always there and is nice as can be. Awesome coronaritas. Super casual grab your own drinks and chips inside.. if you want a server on the weekends outside you can get that too. Their ala carte tacos are bomb... as well as their wraps! love love love this place! be ware on Friday and Saturday they are busy busy busy with the car show that is going on at night..but don't stray its a ton of fun!
