PLZ PLZ let me be the 320ish review of this cafe... yaaa
..
1st, not really much the standard looking "cafe," they serve lux coffee but its on the smallest section in the back of the menu...semantics..whatever.

Now that is out of the way, I will start by saying .Hello "Gallo Blanco, you classy down to earth minx."
 
Great place for two glaring reason: Taste & Design

Taste]]]  I had the veggie torta...and for a man, such as myself, who lovs meat I was very hesitant on ordering this protein deficient and possible savory lacking veggie torta....i like meat. Thankfully, GBC subdued my hesitation and the veggie torta abides... and all is well in the universe.

Design]]]] Walking into Gallo Blanco reminds you that PHX local business owners are still innovators of the industry. Its that or they are really good at ripping off other peoples ideas. Personally, I think that it really takes both to create a great atmosphere and some authentic gumption to be a little different, but still..not..weird.

Thank you to Patrick S. for actually making me go here...
