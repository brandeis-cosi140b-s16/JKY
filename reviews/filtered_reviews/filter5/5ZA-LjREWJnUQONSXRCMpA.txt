As a Latina, I have to say its soooo Mexican in there....glitter murals of Pancho Villa and Frida Kahlo paired with Jaguars and Mayan Temples -- and nothing by salsa musica on the overhead speaker.  I highly approve!  

HUUUUGE burritos!...make sure to try the wet ones (enchilada style) --  the sauce is homemade and perfectly spicy.  

The cooks are amazingly considerate...asking about your preferences and giving your recommendations.  

Great Horchata as well!
