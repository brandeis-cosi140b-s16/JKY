How anyone can rate this resturant with just one of two or even three stars is insane!!! This is one of the best Mexican resturant's that I have ever been to, outside of Mexico! I'm from the Philly area, although we do have some choice Mexican resturants, they simply pare in comparisson tot his place. I discovered this resturant by accident really. I was searchign for a place to have lunch last year after a 90 minute tour of Frank Lloyd Wright's Talyesen West homestead, and accidently came across this amazing resturant. I enjoyed the place so much that I returned this month, as this was the next time  that I made it out to Phoenix. The aesthetics of the place are spot on, the food is exceptional, with a wide variety to select from o nthe extensive menu..and the most important attribute, the quality of the food, authentic tasting and looking fown tothe last taco bite!!! They even offer for $2.00 a 32 ounce of Dos Equis on tap!!!! Astounding!!! Viva Los Olivos!!!
