I may have found a new fav with good New Mexican food..but with a bit of flair.. and a bit of class.... Its a cool, bit of a homey feel with flair... and a country home feel.. LOVE the bar downstairs... 
Small plates is a big thing in DC, where I lived for a bit, so I am always excited when I see it on a menu anywhere here... and done right.. Not just some hummus or dip tossed on a plate and one calls it a 'tapas':-) I didnt have any of the small plates tonight... I was full truly from the pre dinner events.. BUT had to have the pork enchiladas.. and everyone else had the adovada... Mine was awesome, but I had order envy, bc I tasted theirs and it was a firey delight... wanted it and couldnt steal and get away with it... not in this crowd, at least. The waiter was pleasant.. He didnt really know how to pair the wine with the carne adovada... but suggested a couple and brought samples.. cool beans.. Euro style, as it should be done before you buy a bottle. Be warned...the chile is HOT... and if you order..it is yours... warning on menu.. Score one for this restaurant... I love it..
