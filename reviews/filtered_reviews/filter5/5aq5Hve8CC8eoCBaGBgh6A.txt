Taco y Taco dethroned Tacos el Gordo as my favorite taco in Vegas, for a variety of reasons, most of which having to do with a bigger menu.

1) Chicken
2) Fajita vegetables
3) Salsa bar
4) Nachos
5) Vegetarian options
6) Burritos

Like El Gordo, and like the original, less upscale Taco y Taco location, you queue up at different stations for different meats in your taco. I've found the carne asada and pollo to be phenomenal. The adobada is on a par with el Gordo.

Taco y Taco also has a full bar with happy hour specials, music and a large dining room. But I mostly just come here for the chicken fajita burritos, which are as good as any I've eaten.
