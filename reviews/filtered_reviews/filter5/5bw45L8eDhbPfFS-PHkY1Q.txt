So amazing! I saw the reviews on yelp and decided to try it out on my lunch break. I am burrito fanatic and usually go to Los Favoritos or Chipotle. This is seriously like Chipotle meets a little old Mexican grandmother! Haha! If you love Mexican food with a good spice and bold flavors definitely check it out! You will not be disappointed. The jalape√±o cream was the business. Make sure you throw that in your burrito too!
