Mexican restaurant review numero dos...The Tortilla Factory.

How are the ratings on this little gem so low? I loved it. I visited the Tortilla Factory and sat outside on their lovely little romantical patio. The garden-ish area was lit by pretty white lights and the service was perfect. 

I ordered fish tacos and they were incredible. My +1 ordered the salmon and it was super good as well. 

Hit this place up, you won't be disappointed.
