This place is amazing! 

We were driving through Illinois on our way to Wisconsin and read some positive yelp reviews and decided to try Mexican for lunch!

Yes, it is very small and you need to wait your turn for seating, but the turnover was quick and once we sat down we got our drinks and free chips and salsa immediately (great chips and two sauces).

My husband ordered the carne asada torta ahogada. And it was huge and he said the special spicy sauce was perfect: hot AND tons of flavor. He also ordered the chalupas. There were actually three per plate-it was probably the best shaved pork I've ever had. Either of those dishes alone would have made a substantial size lunch. I ordered the chicken gordita (I think it was supposed to come with beans, but I'm glad it didn't, the chicken was so flavorful and enough on it's own). Lastly (I know we were pigs today!) we had a beef volcane. The volcane was probably our least favorite, but the tortilla it was on, and the cheese it was covered in, were delicious (not soggy at all).

Highly recommend for a low-key, cheap, fun, filling meal!
