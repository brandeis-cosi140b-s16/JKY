We had brunch on a Sunday and it was absolutely FANTASTIC!!  We got chips and salsa and a fruit salad as a starter.  Each adult was served a glass of champagne (with refills).  The servings sizes were perfect and the food came quickly and was fresh.  I HIGHLY recommend the brunch menu.  The Huevos Rancheros were AMAZING and I can't wait to go back and have them again!  Miguel took fantastic care of us.  I will ask for him by name next time.
