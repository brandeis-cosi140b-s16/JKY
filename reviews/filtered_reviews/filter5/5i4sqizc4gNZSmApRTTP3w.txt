OK this might be my new favorite burger in town.  The burger is about as tasty as can be.  I highly recomend adding bacon and the saut√©ed onions.  I haven't tried the fires but I'm not much of a french fry person.  I have however had the beef taco and like the burger its excellent.  The customer service could be improved upon but I'm not going to give them lesser review because of it as the food makes up for it (which is rare for me to say).   This is a can't miss place if you like burgers or tacos.
