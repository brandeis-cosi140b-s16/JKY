Went here with a couple of girlfriends for happy hour and dinner. We ordered the pumpkin seed guacamole which was awesome. My friend and I both had the Korean bbq tacos and our other friend ordered the mushroom tacos. It was all amazing. Loved it. Service was good and lots of cute guys hanging out there too. :)
