How is it possible I've never reviewed Habanero's - I've been coming to it (and the other location) since right after Arturo opened them.

This is my go-to place for tacos - I usually get Carnitas and Blackened Shrimp (on corn tortillas), but my other favorite is "Kayla's Favorite" (enchiladas with a fried egg on top).

The staff is really nice, and the food is good.  There's also a bar if you want beer or tequila with your tacos/burritos/enchilada/chilaquiles/whatever. 

Give them a try!
