They always have delicious and fresh food! You walk up to a window and order whatever you want (tacos,burritos, chips&salsa, empanadas, etc) and then you sit down outside under a canopy and wait for your order to be called. It comes out so fast! The steak burrito Is massive and the steak is always tender. Their brushfire and verde salsa is to die for! I always get some to take home for later. Upgrade to the flight it's a better deal and you get yummy tapas. We always take any out of towners here for lunch and they love it! Highly recommend!
