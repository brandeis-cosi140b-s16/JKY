This place was off the hook! Started with the table side guac, HUGE portion! So worth it, lots of flavor, not bland like most places, makes me want to get it over and over! The service was awesome, price is a little high but you pay for what you get and boy do you get a lot! The taste, the flavors, I can't wait to go back again! Definitely a place to try different things each time. I got the carne asada burrito, should call it a taste of heaven in your mouth! The rice on the side was so good! I would come back alone just for the rice, cooked perfectly!!! Only downside I would say is that it's attached to a gentlemans club, but it's alright, the food was amazing!
