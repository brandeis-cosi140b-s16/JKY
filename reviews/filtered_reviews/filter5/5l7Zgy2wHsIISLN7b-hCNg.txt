This place gets 5 stars for its overall epicurian badassery.  What more could you ask for - Great service, Amazing prices and wait for it......Brilliant Baja enspired Fish Tacos (Grilled).   The yellow "Karma Bucket" really works - toss a couple extra bucks in that baby and watch the goodness flow.  
 
My colleague and I travel to PHX every week for an IT project and we look forward to our weekly "Hippy Run" for dinner.  @ John and @ Mike are in the zone with their hospitality and engaging conversations.
