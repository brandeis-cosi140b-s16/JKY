Best tacos in Arizona hands down.  I've eaten at a ton of taco places and yes, I have given out a lot of 5 star reviews, but there is no way that this food can be considered anything less than top notch. I have eaten all of their tacos, the Nopalitos and the Chorizo with fried egg are to die for.  Also the Mole chicken enchiladas are legit.  Very authentic, and very tasty.  What I'm saying, is If you can come here and have a bad time, trust me its you not them.  Have a margarita and lighten up.
