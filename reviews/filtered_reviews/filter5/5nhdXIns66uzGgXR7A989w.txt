this place is pretty amazing.  very attentive staff.  Not to mention the food (locally grown) was delicious and tasted fresh and homemade.  We got in a little early and was advised that a soup was being made but would not be ready for 30 minutes (since it was made fresh).  I waited and was absolutely blown away by the flavor.  Definitely worth it.  And we got to munch on some delicious tortilla chips with 4 salsa choices...all were great.  My friend had the pollo asado, and though I didn't taste it, he loved it (and I also observed it falling off the bone.  And they don't make a bad Marguerita either.  a gem.  Was thoroughly impressed and glad to have happened upon it.  I will be back to this place.
