I really enjoy this place! My husband and I have been searching for a great Mexican place since we moved here (2 years ago) and this is it!  I've been 3 or 4 times and have taken out of town guests here as well.  

I LOVE the tacos. They are incredible.  Prices are very reasonable.  My husband generally orders a burrito of some sort and the quesadillas are way bigger than my kids can eat.  I have two kids (1 and 3) and I'm glad I don't have to worry they are going to break anything (there's nothing to break..) - plus they do have high chairs!

We found it by looking at the Diners Drive-in's and Dives website. We have yet to be led astray by Guy Fieri!
