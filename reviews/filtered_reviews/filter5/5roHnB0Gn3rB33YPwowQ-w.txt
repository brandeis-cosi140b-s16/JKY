My favorite taco place, authentic, yummy and good service. The staff is always so overly friendly, jokes and actually carries conversation with you. Sometimes they give you little samples if the meat. The aplastic is one if my favorites. My roommate and I go here often. We were so happy when they opened this second location as it's down the street from our house. Full bar as well with beers on tap! Great way to end a stressful day at work.
