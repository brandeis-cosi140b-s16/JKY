$2/taco with soooo many different meats to choose from.  Unfortunately, I was being a basic b and went with carne asada tacos only cause I got overwhelmed by all the choices.  Thankfully they were the best tacos I've ever had so far!   My friends had the beef tongue and said it was delicious.  I'll definitely be stopping by next time I'm in Vegas to try the other meats.  Do not be scared by the long wait, it is definitely worth it!

TIPS: There are 3 different lines for different meats, but I was told you can ask for a meat from a different line when its your turn to order.

If you don't know which one to try, I suggest doing what my friends did and stand in the middle one with the most (6) choices and just order all 6 which includes different types/parts of beef and pork.

Have one person from your group save a table first.  People eat pretty fast for the most part, but seating is limited since its so busy.

Both canned sodas and refillable fountain drinks cost 1.40, so ask for the fountain drink if ya thirsty.
