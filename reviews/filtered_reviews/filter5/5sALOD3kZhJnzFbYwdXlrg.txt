Being from San Antonio, I love me some Tex-Mex and this place is the closest thing I have tried in Arizona that comes close to the food we have in Texas.  The enchiladas Itzel were so good and cheesy that I actually came here twice on my vacation in Phoenix.  The restaurant is extremely clean and the decor is like that of cheesecake factory, however unlike cheesecake the prices are what you would expect from an Mexican restaurant.  The service was exceptional and really made my anniversary.  Would definitely recommend this place.
