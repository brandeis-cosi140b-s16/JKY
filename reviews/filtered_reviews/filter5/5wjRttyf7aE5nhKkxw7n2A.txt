Unfortunatly I'm addicted to this place :-( 

It's cheap, it's very filling and delicious. A small order of asada fries are only 5 bucks and we were unable to finish ( we did have two tacos before).

The adobada stands out... Have it with fries ( LOADED with cheese, sour cream, guacamole, PINEAPPLE) or in tacos, quesadillas, or mulas. Either way you can't go wrong with adobada.

Asada was the second best although I didn't enjoy the pico de gallo, it was weird on a taco, I usual have that with chips.....  I was not too fond of the greenish running guac salsa? Although everyone seemed to love it.  The chorizo was too dry and over cooked, although I might not be used to type ( seasoning) of chorizo.

They have a soda fountain so you can get as many refills they also have Mexican drinks such as horchata, jamaica and pineapple juices also unlimited fills and self serve. They have a lime and radishes bar but no salsas .. Which I thought was different. This place is more like caferia style dinning which was a hassle, being there for the first time and not knowing how to order sucked but I totally got over that since we were there the very next day.

As far as the location, it's not a really nice area nor is it fancy, It's open late but it's always full of people. If after 1am ur going to run into a lot of clubbers.. Most not sober. During the day this place if full of families. 

I'm am contemplating going there right NOW!
