My husband took me to this place for our first date nearly 8 years ago, and we've been regulars since. Yes, it's not the fanciest Mexican food,  but that's not why we're regulars...the food is good and cheap, the margaritas are excellent, and my whole family is addicted to their salsa. Great joint that I hope stays in Phoenix for a long, long time.
