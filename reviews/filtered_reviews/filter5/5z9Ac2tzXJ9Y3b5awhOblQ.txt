The Stand is a nice change-of-pace burger / taco option for Phoenix downtowners and hipsters and those of us who aren't zombies. The Stand is awesome for folks with food allergies. I was in there and the owner was explaining his sensitivity towards people with food allergies because of his own personal (family) challenges. 

5 stars for the customer service.
4.5 stars for the food.
4 stars for the prices.

It's a locally owned business, so I'll continue to support it!
