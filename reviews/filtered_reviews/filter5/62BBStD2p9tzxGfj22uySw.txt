My wife and I visited  Canonita once again and had a great experience. Mussels and shrimp appetizer, beef ribs, pork barbacoa, margaritas. All great. 
The waitress was a bit too busy however it was not to the extent that we were not taken care of. a couple times the dirty plates were left on our table too long which is a problem as the tables are very small. Great food and drink.
