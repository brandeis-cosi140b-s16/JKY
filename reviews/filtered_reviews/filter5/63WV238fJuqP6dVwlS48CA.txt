Yes! Yes and YESSSS!!!! I had the short rib enchiladas (angels singing). They were FANTASTIC!!! I am not a "foodie" and I have very simple taste but chile let me tell you....

Desert wasn't as awe inspiring but not bad either. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and he was very attentive.  The hostess (can't remember her name) was very friendly as was our server.  

You have to walk a country mile to get to the restaurant but once you get there it is well worth it. Enjoy!
