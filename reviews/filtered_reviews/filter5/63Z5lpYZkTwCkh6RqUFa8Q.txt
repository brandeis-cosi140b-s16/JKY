WOW!!! This place is a amazing. My husband and I have been here several times and it has never disappointed!! As soon as you sit down they bring you yummy chips, salsa and a spicy brean dip! Make sure you order the fresh avocado dip...they literally cut the avocados and make the dip right at your table!! This place is SO clean and the service is so on point it will blow your mind. Make sure you tip The guitar man!!!!
