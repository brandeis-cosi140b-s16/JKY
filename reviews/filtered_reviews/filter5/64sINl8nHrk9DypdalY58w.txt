This place is one of those little gems that when you find it, you know you've struck gold. My friend and I found this little shop this past Monday when hunger struck us in the AM and we needed to grab a quick bite. The staff is extremely friendly and the prices are crazy cheap. You can get a breakfast burrito for about $3 and they are huge! They'll even give you free chips, and you can head over to the salsa bar and indulge as much as you want. 

So far I've tried the Sausage, egg, and cheese b-fast burrito (add potato) and the Carnitas burrito, which has provided comfort given the ongoing Chipotle debacle and their nationwide shortage of "Properly Raised" pork. Will be back to try more :)
