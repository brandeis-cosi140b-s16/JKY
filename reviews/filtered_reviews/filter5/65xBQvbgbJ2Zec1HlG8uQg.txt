I love this place and used to frequent the locations in San Diego for years. I am so glad that they are following me everywhere I go! Authentic tacos just like I'm sitting at the border ordering 10 tacos (okay maybe 4).  I love the adobada the most, then carne asada, then lengua.  Try this place out you won't be disappointed.
