Living in San Diego for over 17 years spoiled me, as there are 4 tacos elgordo locations in south east county, and a few in TJ Mexico, I remember the good old days of going to caliente betting on football games all day, hitting Chicago Club or Adalitas girlie bars then heading to tacos elgordo for some of the best tacos you will ever eat in your life. 
I love the pork that is sliced off a rotisserie 
the lengue tacos are amazing as are the asada and cabeza.
Now when the wife, daughter and I are in Vegas for our annual 6 days trip, we make sure we hit up tacos elgordo atleast 3 times.
Love it Love Love it
