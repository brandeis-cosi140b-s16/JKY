After hearing about all the hype about this place and seeing it on Man V. Food i just had to try it out. And let me tell you this Los Reyes de la Torta lives up to the hype!

These are the best tortas i have ever had in my whole life and have not found a place better than it in arizona. My personal favorite is the milanesa it just reminds me of my childhood eating breaded steak almost every night for dinner. They use great quality ingredients and they dont skimp out on them and thats what makes this place so great!

Their drinks are awesome too! The agua de fresas is the best thing ever! its so refreshing and tasty its the perfect thing to wash down your torta with. 

Los Reyes de la Torta is definately the king of tortas so make sure you try this place out.
