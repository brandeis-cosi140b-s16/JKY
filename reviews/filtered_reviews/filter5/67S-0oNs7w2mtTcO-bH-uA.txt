Food is very tasty. I loved the oxtail and the crabbed stuffed peppers. I gave them five stars because the atmosphere, service and food were all pretty good and they just opend so it should only get better! It is a little spendy but that's always what i expect from the Summerlin area. The food is well worth it though and I'll definitely be going back soon.
