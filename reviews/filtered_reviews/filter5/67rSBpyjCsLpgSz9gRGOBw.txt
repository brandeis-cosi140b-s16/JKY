Went here on a recommendation from a friend. Very glad we did.
Great service, excellent chips and dark medium-spiced salsa. Margaritas were great too. Our entrees ranged from rellenos to nachos, salmon Caesar salad to the signature adobe plate. Everything was amazing and portions were huge!
You must try this place,it's a sure bet.
