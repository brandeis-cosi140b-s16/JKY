Good tacos and an indirect marriage proposal - one of of which I expected from Tacos El Gordo, the other...not so much. But hey, it's this sort of charm and casual atmosphere that I love in a place.

Having bookmarked this place for months, it took an entourage for me to have the guts to step in - of which, my brother, my friend, and two Spanish-speaking coworkers were all necessary. At first, I was a bit confused. But read the signs, get in line for whatever meat your stomach desires, and walk towards the counter. It's easy enough, especially when the guys making your tacos are some of the friendliest people (I may be biased after my coworker told me that one was smitten with me).

My brother and I do what we do best: divide and conquer. I grabbed a carne asada and adobada taco while he grabbed cabeza and lengua. At two dollars a taco, these are  completely worth the inflated price - brimming with meat and topped with various sauces. Plus, the tortillas are housemade...that's impressive in it of itself. Add a cup of horchata and our total came out to about ten dollars. These tacos are, in short, legit. Our favorites were the cabeza and lengua, but to be honest, I couldn't really distinguish the two by either taste or texture. Tasty has no distinction in my book. The adobada was especially delicious with a slice of grilled pineapple (be sure to ask for it!). But the let down was the carne asada, which was too plain for our liking. 

If marriage to the adobada man means more delicious tacos at my convenience, I may consider it. In fact, since these are some of the best tacos in the Valley, I accept your offer sir!
