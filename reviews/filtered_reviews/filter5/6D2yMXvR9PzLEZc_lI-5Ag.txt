aw man, this is a far, sketchy walk from the quad at 2:30am but worth it!
i kept going back up for more and more spicy adobada tacos- they were so freaking good.  i thought that the asada meat was a little dry but delightful nonetheless.

this is not gastronomie, it's street food at it's finest and probably the most authentic taco experience i've ever had.
