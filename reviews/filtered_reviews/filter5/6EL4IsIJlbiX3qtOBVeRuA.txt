If you like Mexican food, and are in Las Vegas you need to visit El Dorado Cantina, located next to the luxurious Saphire on Industrial Road. The atmosphere is friendly and elegant, the service is outstanding, so are the variety of dishes prepared by Chef Paco, who gave us a fantastic service..He came out to chat, and made us feel part of the family. We ordered beef burritos and cocktails. The dish was delicious and came with three kinds of salsa including "Rico" Guacamole, and the best chili habanero I have tested in Las Vegas. We were there on a Thursday, and Latin music was playing in the background. We will soon be coming back to El Dorado Cantina. This place is Awasome!!
