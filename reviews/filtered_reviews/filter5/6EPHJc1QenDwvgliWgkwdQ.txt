One word: NACHOS 
This place by far has been a favorite since relocating to Phoenix... I've always been impressed by the quality of this chains food (Postinos, Windsor, Federal Pizza & Churn) but this place was an absolute treat! When they brought out the salsa, I was highly impressed by the speedy service.. I ordered the nachos with carne asada and whew! I was blown away.. The abundance of avocado (I'm an avocado whore) and the tender/flavorful carne asada was out of this world. If you like spicy I highly recommend the habanero salsa (for an additional 1.99).. Yum! In honor of this review, I'm going to get some nachos now;)
