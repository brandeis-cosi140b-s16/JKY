Oh my gooooood! Can you say bomb? Go ahead, try it. Okay come back. Yes. These tacos are that and more. Worth all the hype. Worth a little more from me. 

These are no sh*t, amazing tacos with great flavor. But, okay let me esplain something to you. Mexican food is usually the last thing I want to eat when I eat out. My parents are from the valley, born and raised and very Americanized. Still, I grew up with rice and beans with every meal, even steaks, even eggs, no joke. Every. Meal. Some things are like Bruce Willis, they Die Hard. But I love me some tacos man... And these are SOME tacos!

I've been here a handful of times now and have had, I think, every taco of the menu at least once. The tacos de pescado are by far my favourite. Lightly breaded, perfectly seasoned, little pieces of white flaky fish wrapped up in soft warm corn tortillas smothered in a spicy crema. Yum! The tacos pastor are probably my second fav. Tasty marinated carnita covered in a sort of  pico and wrapped in those perfect soft tortillas. I love the tripas (never fear, they cook them way down!) and the carne asada also. And the sonny man always orders the quesadilla. So delicious and I am feenin for one with chorizo right now!

Okay well I have to go get my fix since they were closed for the holidays. Laters baby.
