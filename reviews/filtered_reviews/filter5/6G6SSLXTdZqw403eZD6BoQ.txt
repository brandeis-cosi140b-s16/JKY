There are places that you talk about to visitors as a must taste and there are places that you will miss when you move. Gallo Blanco is both of those things to me. 

I've been there near the beginning and I've seen them adapt from feedback and change over time, all while maintaining a consistent Mexico City style to their food with excellent quality.I have yet to brining a single guest here that doesn't speak highly of it when they leave.

Drinks: Picoso if you like spice, tangy and spicy "margarita".
Food: Guacamole for starters and the Elote, for variety go a 1/2 Torta and a few tacos. Ahi comes and goes from the menu, but if there is a Ahi Taco go for it you wont be disappointed.
