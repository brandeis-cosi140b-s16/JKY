My cousins took me here for the first time during the summer, and it was a lot better than I had anticipated it to be. Their burritos are HUGE. They are not skimpy on their meat, rice, beans, cheese, etc at all! They definitely give you your moneys worth. The line goes by pretty quickly. Seating can be a little hard to find, especially during lunch time (obviously). Can't wait to go back and get another burrito, enchilada style! YUM!
