Barrio Café. I cant express the joy Barrio Café has brought me. The food is more than food. Close your eyes and take a bite...that feeling, taste, all of it is not eating but an experience. Open your eyes & there is music, conversation, art, it is a barrio. This is the neighborhood cafe. I've been a semi-regular since they opened. A fellow Yelp'er & myself came across an ad in a now defunct magazine & we had to check it out. Being Mexican & always on the hunt for good Mexican food, not that water down stuff sold all throughout the state, we gave it a go. I would have given it a 5 star review as I ate. The food = amazing. The waiter became a friend in only one visit. (miss ya John) The ambiance was what I liked. Best guacamole ever. I have had the privilege of speaking with Chef Silvana Salcido Esparza. Have a Tequila question, ask away. She is one of the nicest people I've ever met. So, in conclusion, GO TO  BARRIO! Read the review, try it yourself, make up your own mind.
