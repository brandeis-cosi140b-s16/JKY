Came in during my lunch hour and it was very fast and it was very delicious. My friend asked for freshly made guacamole and to my surprise they actually make the guacamole right in front of you. It was very delicious as well. I had a chile relleno which did not disappoint me at all. It was a great atmosphere, great experience, and most of all great food. Will definitely go there again!
