I truly had an awesome experience at Javier's a couple of weeks ago. I was planning a group dinner for 30+ people and was working with their Events Manager, Julie, along the way. She was super helpful and very responsive to all my emails. 

We were given the option to pick 5 entrees from a list of about 20 of their top plates to add to our prix fixe menu. Our guests were able to pick from a soup or salad, one entree, and choice of flan or fried ice cream for dessert. The price was fairly reasonable as well at $85 per head.... after doing my research and looking into several other spots in Vegas, many of the others had a minimum of $100 per head and their events managers weren't nearly as on top of things as Julie.

Our service was great..... two servers for our group. They were on top of everything, and no one ever felt like they were waiting on something for too long. Drinks were flowing so our guests were extremely happy.

I recommend Javier's to anyone planning a group event who's looking for fair pricing, great atmosphere, and awesome service. Will definitely be back!
