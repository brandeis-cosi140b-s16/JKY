Of course my flight was delayed so I decided to sit down and have a meal at Barrio. First of all the service I received from both the manager and my server was some of the best I have had. After being seated, the manger stopped by to see if I had any questions about the menu, which I did, and he proceeded to go back to the kitchen and show me the type of chip they use for their nachos. While my daughter and I were waiting for our food, he brought her out a thinly sliced apple without me asking for anything. The nachos were different than I have ever had, and were awesome! Their pork is delicious and the sauce, yes sauce, for the nachos was super good. I wish they had a Barrio in Seattle because I will be craving these nachos!!
