We visited Las Vegas with the family and wanted to eat some good Mexican food. So we found this place on good old yelp! From the moment we walked in our experience was terrific!! From the helpful cashier to the amazing cooks in the back. 
Now as for the food... Excellent!! Had the carne asada burrito and I loved it! But the pastor was to die for. Salsa is on point! Their menu is simple, they've got it right! Wish I could get this kind of food in Cali! :( but at least we have a new spot when we come back to Vegas.
