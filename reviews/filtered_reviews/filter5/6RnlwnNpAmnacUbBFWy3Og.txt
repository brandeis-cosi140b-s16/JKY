First time here and you walk in with a welcome so big as if you are in Hawaii!!! Service here is great! We were asked if we've been here before and upon saying no they gave us a bowl to sample each of their meats! Awesomess!!! The flavor was perfectly seasoned, tender and taste just like chopped up version of the real deal! I really could not decide between chicken or steak! So I got both :) This is the ultimate Hawaii version of Chipotle!! Everyone knows how much I love Chipotle !  I honestly would take Braddah's over Chipotle anyday!  PS it's a must to try the Coconut Bark! If you're completely full because of the huge portions they give ... To-go!!!
