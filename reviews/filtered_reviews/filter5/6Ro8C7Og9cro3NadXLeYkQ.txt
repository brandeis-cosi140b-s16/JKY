We went on a Monday afternoon so it wasn't too crowded. The Bar was busy but there was only two tables in the dining area. We were seated and served quickly, the waitress was quick, efficient and friendly. The place was good for kids because it was separated from the bar area by a wall, I am not sure how kid frinedly it would be at night with a full bar.  My 7 year old got the kids nachos, my wife got the pork tacos and I got the supreme tostada nachos. We all loved our food it was delicious. The pork taco's were the best we had ever had, the kids nachos were tasty and the cheese sauce it really good. The supreme nachos were excellent and slightly hot due to the fried jalapenos. The only complaint would be that the supreme nachos were a little smaller than I expected. My wife ordered a Mango Thai Basil Margarita and she said it was tasty and she enjoyed it. We all shared a Churro sundae and it was so good. We couldn't finish it all but we tried. It comes with chocolate, caramel and raspberry sauce with 4 churros. We had a great late lunch and it was well worth the trip to Fremont. We will definitely be back again!
