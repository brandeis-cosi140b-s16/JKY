My review is 4 stars for the food, and 5 stars for the staff.  

The food isn't bad.  They have a selection of salsas that are pretty good.  There look to be some awesome nacho platters.  I had their enchiladas one day and those were good, and tacos another day that were also pretty decent.  The fajitas both looked and smelled awesome when I saw them.  One person in my party had a burger that looked good.  

The atmosphere is pretty standard for a decent sports bar.  Family area to keep the kids away, large bar area with tables.  There are quite a few great beers on tap and they also make some unique blends with the beers as well.

So far this sounds like a 3 and 1/2 to 4 star review, I know.  But this staff took care of me during a recent stay while my mom was in the hospital up the street.  I was staying the night at the hospital and these guys knew my name, knew my drink, and offered their best.  They also let me hang out by outlets a couple of days to charge up my laptop, phone, etc.  The staff here is definitely second to none.  

There IS better Mexican in the area, but I haven't found an all out better bar.  It's also nice to have somewhere non smoking in Vegas to hang out in.  Go enjoy!
