Whenever my husband is craving Mexican food, we head over to Viva Zapatas!  They are just as good as Lindo (if not better), but without the super high price.  The food is always great and they keep the homemade chips and salsa/bean dip coming.  If you order guac, they make it right at the table.  They usually offer a complimentary cup of soup as well.  What I really love about Zapatas is that they always accommodate my picky food needs and never make me feel badly about it.  The service is top notch!

They also have one of the best margaritas in Vegas!  They have a great happy hour from 2p.m.-6:00 p.m. (I think) M-F with 2 for 1 drinks - you can't beat it!  I love the live music every night and since they are located so close to the Galaxy Theater in the Cannery, it's the perfect date night restaurant too!

The restaurant is a bit hard to find since they are in the same lot as a gas station (if you are coming off of the Craig Rd. exit on 95 - turn towards Pecos Road and you can't miss it) but I promise, it's worth it!  Zapatas is definitely an Eastside hidden gem!
