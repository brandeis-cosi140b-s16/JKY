The best just got better. This place just opened up where the old Lunardis was. It looks great on the inside but I must admit I liked being in the close old huddled 2 table rasta. This has more of a sit down feel to it.

But the one thing that didnt' change is the food. It just keeps getting better and better. The specials are awesome on the weekends and the Live Music on Reggae Nights adds to the already chill atmosphere. 

The service is great and the staff are very friendly. Also the food comes out quick so a great place to go for lunch.

My favorite items are the Jerk Chicken Tacos and the Taquitos whenever they are available.
