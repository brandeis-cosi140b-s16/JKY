If you're new to Mexican food or you want to have a stylish and intimate Phoenix Mexican dining experience, aqui es el lugar.  Intimate bar too.  When service staff smile have dilated pupils and dreamy looks about the food as they describe it, one knows it must be pretty good.  You will pay.  In our case we were hoping for quiet, attractive surroundings for discussion and a good lunch.  Asi Es La Vida worked well.

I recommend the aguas frescas.  Watermelon was excellent.  The tres leches cake too.  The red salsa, smoky with real chipotle flavor was excellent as was spinach salad, chicken mole and green enchiladas.
