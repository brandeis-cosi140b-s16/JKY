I have literally never been to a better fast-casual Mexican place. While I do love local favorites Fausto's and Roberto's, this place takes the cake. Everything I have tried on the menu is amazing (I especially love the wet burritos and the fish tacos). 

I usually visit for lunch and the owner is always working the register - when it's not super slammed, he'll come by your table to talk to you about the food. Real, genuine friendliness - something not easy to find in this town. 

Looking for good mexican food, or just good food, come here. You won't be disappointed!
