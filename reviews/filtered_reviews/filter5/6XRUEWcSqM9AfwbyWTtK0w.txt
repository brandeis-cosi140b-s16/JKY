Great Burrito!  On Thursdays they have $5.49 Burritos and it's a steal.  I had the Chipotle shrimp burrito and my wife had the fish and plantain burrito. Both were excellent!  Try the Salsa bar as well!!  The owners were so kind as to bring our 3 year old a free cup of milk and a side of rice and beans (also free). It's service like this that makes customers for life!  We will be back!!
