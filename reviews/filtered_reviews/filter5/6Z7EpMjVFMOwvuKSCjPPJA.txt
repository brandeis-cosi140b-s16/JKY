Mad Mex reminds me of my time at Duquesne. 

I used to run here for the one hour that I could get the Big Azz Margarita for $6 but now I think it's $7 (sometimes before my European Union night class!). My personal favorite is the frozen raspberry Margarita! 

Also I love the potato taquitos, who doesn't love a tortilla stuffed with mashed potatoes!!! 

I came back after 5 years and Mad Mex is unchanged, hallelujah!
