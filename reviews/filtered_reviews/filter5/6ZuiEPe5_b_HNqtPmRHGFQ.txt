I'm always in the fence about hotel food, but Pink Taco has restored my faith. I absolutely loved the atmosphere, waitress, and food. I liked it so much that I wanted to leave a review to convince people to give this place a shot! I had the Sabano de pollo, and I actually went back the next day as well because I wanted to have it again before I left Las Vegas.
