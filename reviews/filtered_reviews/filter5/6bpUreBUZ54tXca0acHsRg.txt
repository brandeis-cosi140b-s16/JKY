Wahoo! - I luv this place.

I've long been a fan of Wahoo's, just love their fish tacos and Cajun beans. 

This new location in Boca Park is just perfect. The outside seating is splendid, with a rather pleasing view of the mountains and a good respite from the sun.

I can only hope the staff continues to get better.
