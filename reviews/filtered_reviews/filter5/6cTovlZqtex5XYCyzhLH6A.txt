It really doesn't get better than this when it comes to Mexican in champaign.  From their chorizo burritos and nachos to the tortas and tacos, this place is worth braving that long line that snakes out the door into sub zero temps.  Maize always hits the spot (sadly, even when you occasionally find a bit of bone in the chicken.)
