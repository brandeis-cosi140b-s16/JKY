Tacos were amazing.  Period. Very tasty and flavorful. The refried beans were house made and delicious. This review is not for the drinks. My margarita was ok. And for the price of $8 it was meh. Next time I'll have a $5 Mexican beer and I'll know what I'm getting. The Service was great and they made the most of the small space and were flipping tables as fast as they could. The salsa bar had an array of about 15 flavors ranging from super spicy to very mild. I'll be back for more tacos soon.
