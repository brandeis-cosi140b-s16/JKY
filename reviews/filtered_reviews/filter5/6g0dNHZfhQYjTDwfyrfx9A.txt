Hands down the best burger EVER!!! Who thought of deep frying a pretzel bun??? These guys! Amazing and unique combination of tastes. Everything on the menu: great flavor and affordable. 

TIP: if they bring back the Ultimate Burger, get 5 "for here" and 5 "to go". Order French toast fries, seasoned fries, well you should really everything on the menu because they're all good! 
I lied, I've never tried their tacos... I bet they're good though. Til next time...
