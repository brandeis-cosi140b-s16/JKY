Atoyac is an experience far beyond what the average 'Bertos can provide. The owner/operators are very friendly and helpful with explaining the ins and outs of several menu items that aren't always immediately familiar with even native Phoenicians. Don't let the cheap strip-mall and bare look fool you, this place is much greater than the sum of its walls.

Everything on the menu is affordable, but the food and handmade drinks are crafted by Dan and Pablo with real care an passion. Familiar tacos asada are a good place to start, but try the other meats even if you've never worked up the will to try tongue or tripe before. The Mexican hotdog and Tlayudas are must-trys, too. If they have horchata you must try it - it's not a powder mix and the nuts + melon added make for a very refreshing beverage.

As for fake reviews, I don't buy it. I've never been able to walk into a restaurant and instantly begin chatting with the other patrons about how good the food is.
