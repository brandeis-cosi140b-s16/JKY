This place is THE BEST. Their food is amazing especially on a Saturday or Sunday morning ;) I always get the ham and cheese and potato breakfast burrito and it's absolutely delicious. They also have good agua de horchata. I've also been to the Gilbert Los Favs and it's equally good. And they have Cruisin USA in the back!
