This is hands down the best deal you will find for breakfast on the south end of the strip. I wish I would have discovered it sooner in our trip. We always got the $3.99 breakfast which consisted of eggs, choice of meat, breakfast potatoes and toast or tortilla. They do upcharge you for more tortillas and also to bring you salsa with the meal. I guess I should have asked. The salsa is very good though and worth the price. This is a very satisfying breakfast and a steal at what they are charging. They also offer $.99 Bloody Mary which I tried and it was pretty good. It is not very big, but what do you expect for $.99? We ate here every morning for the rest of our trip once we realized how good it was and what a great value for the money. You must come here if you are looking to not break the bank and still get a hearty, tasty meal.
