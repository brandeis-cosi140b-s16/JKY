The best authentic Mexican food this side of the border! You can't go wrong with anything that you order. I am spoiled when it comes to Mexican food because my grandmother from Queretaro cooked for us the majority of her life, she was 102 when she passed, so you know her cooking was traditional and authentic! The food was absolutely delicious and the aguas frescas were perfect after a long, hit day, they took me back to my days in Mexico when I was just a kid.  I will definitely be coming back! The chef is amazing!
