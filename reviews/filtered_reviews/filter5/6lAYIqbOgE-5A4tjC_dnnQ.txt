We hosted my parents 50th Wedding Anniversary in one of the private rooms upstairs.  This had to be the easiest event I have ever done with any venue.  The food was good, the staff amazing and the evening went off flawlessly.  They allowed us to bring in our own cake and decorations and even coordinated their napkins to our color scheme.  The waiters were on top of  keeping drinks and food fresh.  We could not have asked for a better experience.
