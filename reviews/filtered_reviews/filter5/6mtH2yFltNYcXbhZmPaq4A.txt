The avocado margarita changed my life, It really isn't the first thing that jumps in my mind when ordering a margarita...but I have to say it was one of the tastiest blended rita's I have guzzled....yeah no lady like behavior going on here.   This place is a must experience when visiting the Southwest.  They do a wonderful job executing southwest cuisine with a modern twist.  also don't leave without trying the Elote.
