Wow, I can't believe I haven't been here in years.  I should keep this place in my rotation more often, it is really awesome, however be aware it is really small.  They have pretty good wines on their list, but their margaritas are amazing.  The food is really spicy, my husband was in heaven.  I had the carne adovada sliders, so delicious and my husband had the pork, shrimp and beef enchiladas.  I had a taste of each of them, they were so yummy.  They also have a room for private parties, you can reserve it with $500, that will towards the bill that night, so it is a pretty good deal if you have a large group and you want to enjoy their food and drinks. Hmmm, my birthday is coming up pretty soon!
