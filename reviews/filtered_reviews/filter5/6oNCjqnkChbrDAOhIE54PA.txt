Delicious steak and egg sandwich. Naco Torta. Sweet, sunny Jesus. I've been thinking about it for days. Negro Modelo on tap. What else do you need? Friendly and fun staff too. Calling it the "bomb" as some reviewers have may be a tad inappropriate considering the history of the hotel above it. An investigative reporter was assassinated in the parking lot with a car bomb in the 1970s.
