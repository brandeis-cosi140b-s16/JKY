I love this place!!

The chips and salsa are fantastic, I couldn't stop eating them.  The food was excellent, the service was prompt and friendly, and even the desert was delicious (tres leches)!

We went on a Friday night and were one of the only ones in the restaurant, which surprised me.  We also ordered a margarita (one of the ones large enough to share) and it was perfectly prepared.

I look forward to coming here again and highly recommend giving it a shot if you haven't yet.  The free dessert Yelp coupon alone makes it worthwhile!
