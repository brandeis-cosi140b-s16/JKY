I haven't eaten at a Mexican food restaurant since 09/13 due to fear of gluten/cross contamination. This restaurant, without a doubt, is one of the best I have ever eaten at. The food is non-gmo, organic, and majority gluten free. I had the steak, chicken, shrimp fajitas, my wife had street taco's and daughter had tostadas. Yelp reviews are right on. The food was excellent and our server, Enrique, top shelf. The food was seasoned exceptionally well. I didn't know rice could taste so delicious. The Executive Chef, Paco, made a visit to our table twice as did the manager. I love a restaurant that understands the importance of locals. There was no rush to place the bill in front of us halfway through our meal like so many other eateries. The Flan, an unexpected treat from the Executive Chef, was excellent. As a person with Celiac disease is often afraid to try a new restaurant, or any for that matter, I was confident that my meal was gluten free. We made a reservation and I indicated that I have Celiac disease. Enrique, our server assured me that he understood my situation. He also informed us that if I wanted to try a gluten menu item the chef would do what he could to make it gluten free without sacrificing quality. We will be back. Monday's=25% off total bill. The restaurant will begin honor in military with 20% discount. They got me for good.
