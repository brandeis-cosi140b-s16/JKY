Okay, all I have to say is "wow"! Taking my heart away as the best simple Mexican fare in the area. 

Yes they are small, but it is a family-run place and Richie, the co-owner, was fantastic. I know what I like, he made his suggestions and it was on! Service was great, but the food was even better. 

My only wish is that they were open a bit later, but I am fine as-is!
