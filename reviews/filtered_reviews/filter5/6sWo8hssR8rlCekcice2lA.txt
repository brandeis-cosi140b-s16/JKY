I found a new favorite spot. 

The service was great, letting me sample things before committing to anything, and above all, friendly.

The prices are amazing, especially the soup. It's been awhile since I've felt completely stuffed after spending just $4.50 anywhere that isn't fast food. 

And most importantly, the taste. Muy bueno. Or should I say, "Gadzooks, that's good!"

I'll most definitely be going back.
