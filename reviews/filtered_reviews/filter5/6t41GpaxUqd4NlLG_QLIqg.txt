Ate there yesterday.  I had the machaca fish tacos and they were delicious and served very quickly.  I added the shredded cabbage and some other cabbage that was more like coleslaw.  If I lived in Phoenix, I would try other stuff on the menu.  It was also inexpensive which is nice. Definitely will go there next time I'm in Phoenix and in that area.
