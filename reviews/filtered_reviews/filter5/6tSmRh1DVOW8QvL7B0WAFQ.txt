Had a late lunch here. The mole chicken tacos were easily the best I've had north or south of the border. The food quality and flavors are second to none. A welcome departure from the standard tex-mex. The salsas were so fresh and interested four immediately jumped onto my plate. A cels toro, peanut, strawberry , and chipotle. Can't wait to return.
