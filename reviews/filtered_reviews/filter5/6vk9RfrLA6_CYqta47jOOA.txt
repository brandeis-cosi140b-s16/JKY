Authentic, great quality and excellent flavors. The tacos are amazing and if you get one with everything, one taco is enough! They are huge! Their signature green salsa is the best and compliments their food perfectly. Their aguas frescas (fruit waters) are refreshing and flavorful, not too sweet. I've never had a bad experience and my Friends, Family, Co-workers and I enjoy eating here when we are on this side of town.
