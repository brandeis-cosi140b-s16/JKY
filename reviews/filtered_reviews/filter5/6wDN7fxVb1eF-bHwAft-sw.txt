this is the best Mexican food in the valley. from the outside it looks like a dive, but it should be on diners, drive inns, and dives because the food is that good. i have been eating here for over 10 years and have never had a bad meal. make sure you get the soup, it is awesome!! if you have not been you are missing out!
