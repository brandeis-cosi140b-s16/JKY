Great "hole in the wall" burger joint in North Phoenix. The prices are reasonable ($5.25 for a regular burger) with $1-3 sides. They have a weekly specialty burger which is always killer. This week was the "Tripple Demon" which I obviously had to order. Burger patty, breaded pork medallion, ham off the bone with all the fixins. Amazing stuff. 

Must try their sweet potato tots, beach house burger and brûlée burger.
