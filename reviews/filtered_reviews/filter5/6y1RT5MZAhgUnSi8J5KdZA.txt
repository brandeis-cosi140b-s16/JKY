Yummy! We didn't know what to expect when we pulled up at this little, tiny, yellow place but it surprised us (in a positive way!)! First time we had huaraches and we absolutely loved them. The owner/cashier was really speedy and promptly delivered our food. Only weird thing was that the Sangria actually wasn't sangria (it was non-alcoholic). The three different salsas were fun.
