I loved the chips and mesquite roasted tomato salsa (2.95), but  I was CRAZY about the shrimp and chorizo sopes.  They come with an ample amount of guacamole, black beans, and cilantro rice.   17.95

I was sorry I ate so any chips...but that salsa....

Service was good, we were seated immediately, and it wasn't too noisy when we were there.
