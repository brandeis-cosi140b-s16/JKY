I've been here many times and never been disappointed. $1.99 Mini tacos are my favorite. Spinach and pineapple agua fresca is delicios. I've tried all the meats on the menu they're all on point, but my favorite is al pastor. I work in mexican restaurant my self so I know when the food is made from scratch. This is as good as it gets from this concept. The staff is always nice, friendly and efficient.  This is definitely one of my spots when it comes to simple and delicios mexican food.
