One of our favorite places. Such a great happy hour and patio. This may seem weird but they have the BEST wings ever. I don't usually eat wings but I can't get enough of the hot grilled ones from them. 

Tomas is awesome and always has great suggestions. The rest of the staff is amazing also. I could go on and on but seriously try the wings or fajitas and wash it down with a margarita on the rocks. 

The cantina and patio are where it's at. Also don't forget to try the wings.
