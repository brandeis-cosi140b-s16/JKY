We were walking around the forum shops in Caesars and saw this place and decided to eat here. Half of our group got the brunch, the other half ordered off the menu. Everything was absolutely delicious. If you can eat a lot, get the buffet. Also, they have delicious drinks! The staff is very friendly and great. They all go out of their way to make sure you're time is great here. Nice ambiance as well. Will definitely be back!
