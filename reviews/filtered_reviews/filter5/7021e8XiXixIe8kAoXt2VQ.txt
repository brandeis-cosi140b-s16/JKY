This place is next level!!! My girlfriend and I, who is a very picky eater, decided to check this place out after discovering it on yelp. Walked in and immediately felt at home. The atmosphere was amazing, this place definitely did its research in the feng shui department.

The staff here is great! Our waiter was so helpful and friendly. He gave us some tips on how to order and told us just to sample a couple things between the two of us since it was our first time. So we followed his advice and ordered the Chicharrone de queso, which was BOMB but a little too much for two, and the Carne Asada Tacos, Cochinita and Carne Asada Torta and split that between the two of us. 

The Carne Asada Tacos were the best i have every had!!! The meat was so juicy and tender with a sweet kick to it, which immediately reminded me of Korean BBQ Bulgogi, which i LOVE!!! The Cochinita Torta was great too but no where near as good as the Carne Asada Torta.

After the meal was over the waiter took the Carne Asada Tacos off our bill since it was our first visit, which was awesome! Overall this place was FANTASTIC! One of the best experiences i have had at a restaurant and will definitely be coming back.
