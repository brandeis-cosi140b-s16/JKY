I ate there for the first time last week, and it was fantastic. I got there early to beat the lines and actually got a seat inside. I really cant think of any criticisms. I can't remember the name of what i ordered, but I do remember that it came on a perfect flour tortilla grilled to perfection. The meat was extremely tasty, and the onions and cilantro made it perfect. Plus, the prices were amazing. I'd recommend them to any of my friends.
