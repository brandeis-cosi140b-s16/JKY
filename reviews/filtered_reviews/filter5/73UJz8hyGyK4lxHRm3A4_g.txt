Hands down the best Mexican food in Las Vegas! My friend and I had the menudo which was BOMB! It came with hand made tortillas which made it that much better. We also ordered fish and shrimp tacos, EVEN BETTER! The flavor with the handmade tortilla & fresh shrimp & fish (which was fried) was so delicious. We will definitely be back for more
