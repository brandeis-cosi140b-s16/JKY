I am a huge fan of Mexican food and americas taco shop has it figured out. They are quick, affordable, and clean. My experience has always been great. My favorite is the carne Asada burrito and grilled chicken tacos. The staff is friendly and the tables are always clean which is rare for a quick service restaurant. 

Will continue to visit for sure
