My husband and I moved to Charlotte about 9 months ago from Los Angeles.  We are both native Spanish-speaking Latinos and grew up in households where eating traditional Mexican foods as well as Central American foods was part of our daily lives (I'm from Nicaragua and my husband is Mexican-Cuban).... 

Coming to Charlotte, we knew that it would be difficult to find food that even comes close to the awesome-ness of LA's Mexican-food scene.  We are truly foodies when it comes to Mexican and Latino cuisine.... 

Well, Three Amigos is as close as  you're going to get to the BEST Mexican cuisine in Charlotte.  All the food is made from scratch and they serve traditional Mexican fare: tacos in warm corn tortillas, topped with onions and cilantro; Enchiladas made from scratch with authentic sauces.... If you eat meat, their Al Pastor is pork marinated in spices over 24-hours and is phenomenal... The Gorditas are hand-made: thick, hand-made corn tortillas stuffed with goodness; Plus, you can tell everything by the rice and beans (the staple of any mexican dish or latino dish)... Their mexican rice is just like my father-in-law used to make and refried pinto beans that are fresh, not from a can!

You cannot get Mole anywhere else in Charlotte that is authentic - this is the only place I have found that makes an amazing mole....  Plus, if you've got little ones, they are a family-friendly spot too... Our two-year old loves it here!  The service is great - everyone is friendly and attentive.... you may have to wait a little bit for your food but that's because it's actually home-made and not "reheated" from a can.... Do yourself a favor, and head over there for some delicious food!
