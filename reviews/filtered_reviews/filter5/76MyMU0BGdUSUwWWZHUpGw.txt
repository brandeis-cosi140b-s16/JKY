If I could give this place 6 stars I would. WOW. The food is INCREDIBLE. The best mexican food I've ever had. 

I had the chicken quesadilla platter with charro beans and rice. Sounds pretty boring doesn't it? Quite the contrary. This isn't your typical mexican food. 

I'm not sure what "Sonora" style means (which is what the guy that took my order told me), but I'm loving it. I want everything "Sonora" style from now on. 

The food had so much flavor - it tasted like everything had been simmering for days. 

The salsa, OH THE SALSA. They actually brought out 2 different kinds of salsa as well as some guacamole - all tasty, but my favorite and need-to-lick-the-cup-clean-it's-so-delicious salsa was the chunky one with onions and green chilis in it. More please. 

I finished every single morsel of food on that plate (which was A LOT!) and for $9 out the door (including a drink), I will absolutely be back here. Maybe tomorrow. And the next day. And the next...
