Isn't this what everyone has been waiting for to happen? Sushi in burrito form. Duh. Anyways, it was as good as I hoped. I ordered a seaweed burrito with spicy tuna, tamago, cucumbers, green onions, hush chili, and wasabi mayo. My boyfriend ordered the long beach. I think if you keep it to one protein and just pack it full of veggies it's a better deal than the signature items. The taro chips are a must, but it was really strange with cheese. I tried to stick to mostly Asian ingredients, but I'm curious to see what it would taste like in a tortilla. 

The place was packed, which is understandable. They had a ton of people working there but it still seemed really slow. They didn't seem to have a good system going as to telling the cashier what people have ordered. I also think they could consolidate some items. Do we really need green onion and red onion? Cabbage and romaine lettuce? Tomatoes and pico? Nice to have the options but they had a hard time hearing and understanding what I wanted for my custom order. Also the salsa station was really random but then again I didn't order any Mexican ingredients. Loved their rice press though.

Overall great experience and hope they expand to other parts of town soon. More seating would be great!
