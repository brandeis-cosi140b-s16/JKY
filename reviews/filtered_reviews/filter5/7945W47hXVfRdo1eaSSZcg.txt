Absolutely delicious breakfast!!!  Not an easy restaurant to find as there is no sign outside.  But it is worth the adventure.  It is a small "hole in the wall" but none of the bad stuff.  It has a lush cozy interior.  The food is tex-mex style so everything comes with a tortilla.  There was even a tortilla hidden beneath the salad!  The eggs benedict was cooked perfectly.  Perfectly poached eggs over two juicy perfectly seasoned pork loins... and it was all on top of a tortilla.
