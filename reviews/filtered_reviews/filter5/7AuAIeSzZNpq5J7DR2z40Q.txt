WOW I was a little skeptical coming here being so close to the club but this restaurant has provided excellent customer service for more family orientated outings ! The food is to die for especially if you're having a craving for some Mexican. The desert is beautifully crafted by Chef Paco who even made a friendly introduction :) Outstanding service !!
