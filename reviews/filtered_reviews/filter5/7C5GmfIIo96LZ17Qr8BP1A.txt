LOVE this place, and here's why......
- GREAT, friendly and fast service. There are always 3-4 people coming by your table and refilling water/soda/beer/chips/salsa/bean dip! They are on top of it!
- Fresh tasting food. A lot of Mexican food around town (and elsewhere for that matter) taste like it's been sitting around for hours waiting to be served. This almost always seems fresh.
- Fair prices! The prices for items and combos are great! Great happy hour too.

I recommend the rancho style tacos and (of course) the fajitas!

I hope people support this place and keep it in town. This is a hard location for businesses to prosper it seems. SUPPORT GOOD BUSINESSES!
