We decided to eat here before seeing Zarkana.  We were a bit early so we ordered some wine from their bar and went into the casino to gamble a bit.  When it was time for our reservation we were e immediately seated.  The ambiance is dimly lit and swanky.  Perfect for a night out in Vegas.  We started with chips, salsa and guacamole. Both The salsa and guac were great.  We ordered the arrachera which came with a bean pur√©e.  We also ordered the chicken and stuffed pepper.  Everything was flavorful and perfectly cooked. Service was on point the entire time.
