This is NOT mexican. It is New Mexican style food which has a distinctly different flavor than Mexican or Tex-Mex. In short, this place is amazing. Very tasty and unique flavors that you don't really find anywhere else. Do make a reservation because the place is always packed. Pass on the margarita because they're too damn sweet.
