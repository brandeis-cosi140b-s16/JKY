The place did not disappoint. The moment we stepped through the archway, my friends and I were bedazzled by the ambience throughout the area.

 It really DOES feel like a tavern, almost like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean (Well.. kind of)

But yeah, the portions were overwhelming, and best of all? The food was spectacular. I sat outside, but honestly? I think the place is pretty both ways, so don't be too stingy on the location :)

Jus go.
