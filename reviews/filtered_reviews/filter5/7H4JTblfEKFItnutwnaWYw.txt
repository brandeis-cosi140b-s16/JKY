Another local gem. It may not look like much from the outside -- a small shop in a rundown old stripmall off of Decatur -- but inside you'll find some of the best fusion tacos and other great food at a modest price.

This place is all about the food. Both Korean-Mexican fusion tacos ($1.29 ea.) I tried were amazing. The pork and beef in each was a wonderful blend of sweet, sour, and spicy flavors. The tacos were generously topped with their respective protein, along with cabbage, tomatoes, and cilantro.

The pastor sope ($2.59) was a sizable portion of pork over beans and a light, crispy corn base and topped with lettuce and cotija cheese. The pork was excellent, without being too spicy.

The hand-made pork wontons ($1) came four to an order. All were crispy and delicious -- as good as any fried wontons around.

The bulgogi fusion burrito ($4.99) is big and delicious. It's stuffed with the same delicious beef as the tacos, along with Mexican rice, onions, pico de gallo, cilantro, and lettuce. There's no doubt this is the best burrito I've had.

The weakest dish I've had was the orange chicken ($3.49 for a half order). While the quality of the chicken was great, it lacked the punch in flavor that the other food had.

On my first visit I was given chips and fresh guacamole after ordering. On my second visit no chips -- they were busy so maybe they just forgot. And to finish the meal they deliver orange slices and fortune cookies. Everything may seem like an odd combination, but it all works because it's all delicious.
