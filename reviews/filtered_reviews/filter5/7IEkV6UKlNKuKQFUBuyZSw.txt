The staff has always been on point every time I dine here and has always provided the best service. The food brings back memories for me from when I used to go to a particular restaurant in long beach California when I was a kid and it's nice to know that now I have somewhere in Vegas that has the same type of great atmosphere and amazing food. The fried ice cream is the best I've ever had so far definitely recommend Leticia's for anyone that wants some quality Mexican food. :)
