Oh my sweet baby jesus. I have a new love in my life (sorry Ray L.), adobado street tacos from El Gordo!

I will tell you about my tastes for one second. I am a minimalist. I usually order things on the side or plain, especially with Mexican food. I do this because my tongue can't handle much heat despite the fact that I am 1/2 Mex. So, my honey and I met at The District to take our son to My Gym on V-Day, and he brought along tacos from El Gordo to surprise me. I had never had their food before this. I opened up the plate, and was thrown off because the pork looked like the sweet pork from Chinese places. You know how it is slightly reddish on the outside? Okay, mine was meat and tortilla only and his had a mix of cilantro/onion plus a few pieces of pinapple on top. To be honest here....I totally lifted my nose to the idea of fruit with my taco. When we were done there happened to be one taco left. I just couldn't let it go to waste! I took a bite with everything on it and.....IT WAS SO GOOD!

Now I wish my other tacos were like that. The lesson to my story is this:

If you don't step outside your comfort zone once in a while, you will let all the joys of life pass you by!

These delicious tacos from heaven only cost $2 each. No rice and beans available here, but I don't give a damn. Who wants to stuff yourself with fillers? The crowds are huge at lunchtime but it's only because these little yummies are a force to be reckoned with. By far, they are the best Las Vegas has to offer.
