Very cool atmosphere. A lot of healthy choices.  Had the Adobe Chile Chicken bowl  which is fantastic. Had the chicken soup as an appetizer and it tasted great, but all of the cheese melted and was at the bottom of the soup. It is a very casual atmosphere. The food comes out quickly.  Did not have dessert but they have soft serve coconut ice cream. Thy have a choices of sauces for the tacos and bowls that tasted good.  Service was good and quick. Thy have private parking right in front of the restaurant. They have a huge outdoor patio with heaters.
