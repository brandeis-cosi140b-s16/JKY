Best tacos in town! I've been to TJ and yes this is pretty damn close to the same flavor you get in Baja Mexico! 

I tried the carne asada and adobada tacos = delicious!

Order first, pay at cashier and then find your table.

This place is doing so well, they added two outdoor patios and just bought out their neighbor's space.
