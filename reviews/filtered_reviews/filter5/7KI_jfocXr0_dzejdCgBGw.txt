This place is amazing..  It was busy but we ate at the bar...  The service by both bartenders was awesome!  Would highly recommend the yellow jacket drink.

Ordered the flank steak tacos..  Prob the best I ever had!

To sum it up best food and service I had at a meal in a long while..  Gonna be tough to top it!!  This place is a must...  It is a lil pricy but well worth it!!
