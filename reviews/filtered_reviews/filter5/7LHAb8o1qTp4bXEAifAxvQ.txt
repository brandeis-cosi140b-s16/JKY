AMAZING! 
My bf and I went to meet some friends for their happy hour on Sunday. We decided to eat downstairs and got a few stools at the bar. There was $5 dollar hot plates and red/whites per glass. 
We ordered beef tenderloins skewers and briskets as well calamari. Calamari came out first and it was pretty good. Had a mixture of big and small pieces. Have had better but was worth what we paid for. 
Then came out the skewers in 4 sauces. Wow! I mixed the sauces as if I was Picasso ready to paint with my tenderloin skewer (especially the hollaindaise tasting one it was so delicious) and devoured the beef paint brush almost instantly. 
After that we were greeted with the beef briskets - it was little pieces of bread with a piece of beef tenderloin and brie cheese melted on top. To die for is an understatement!
We had to order one more hot plate as to how amazing everything was as well as the cheap price. Ordered the tacos and took 1 of each. My bf ate the carne avodo and fish, I had the beef and chicken. The beef had an amazing kick of spices in the mouth and the chicken had this unexplainable tasting sauce that was decadent! 
After the 4 hot plates we did not have enough room for a sip of water let alone dessert! We closed out and it was a cheap but absolutely delicious good lunch.
