After an awful experience at San Antonio's we decided to try Paco's Tacos and Tequila. We have been back three times and each time has been wonderful. The beef brisket tacos are amazing, and the jalapeno infused tequila margarita is the best margarita I have ever had. Everything is fresh, authentic, priced well, and service is great! Thank you for putting this great restaurant in South Park!
