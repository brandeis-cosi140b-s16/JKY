Obsessed!! I have been three times in three weeks!!

The Queso that they have is my favorite and I could have it with every meal!! It has Chorizo and Sauteed onions in it YUM!! I have had a different dish each time I've been and I will say that they all have been really good! The Carne Asada is my Favorite as of right now but  that will change in the week I'm sure!

The servers are really sweet and on top of my Margaritas!!

My FAVORITE Mexican in Charlotte!!
