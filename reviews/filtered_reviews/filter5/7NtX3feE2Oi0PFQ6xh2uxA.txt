Nice option for This side of town. There aren't too many decent Mexican restaurants on the south side of lv so this is a nice treat. The Al pastor tacos come with pineapple, pico de gallo,  and their avocado sauce...I was pretty surprised I enjoyed it as much as I did. The carne asada was great and so was the chicken. They have a ton of meat options and also offer a vegan and vegetarian menu including soyrizo! The staff was helpful it being our first time at their counter and offered samples for anything we wanted to try. Salsa bar has nice options too! When I don't feel like making my own tacos, they are definitely my go to shop
