If you're looking for authentic Mexican tacos? Go here. Hands down the best tacos in Central Illinois. I grew up in the South Side of Chicago, moved to Bloomington for school and later moved here to Champaign... as one can begin to imagine, finding an authentic mexican joint has been a difficult task. 
I also like the fact that there are no actual tables, just bars and stools - reminds me of those good ol taco corner restaurants in my old neighborhood. Skip the other restaurants, and pick some food up here and enjoy it in the comfort of your home if it's too crowded. Definitely worth it!
