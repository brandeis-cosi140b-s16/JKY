Let me start by saying this place has the BEST margaritas. The guys and gals at the bar really know what they are doing. I have never actually ate AT the restaurant but have gotten carry out from them a few times. The quesa tacos are AMAZING. You can get them with flour tortillas or corn. I have tried both and personally prefer the flour but I'm not a big fan or corn tortillas to begin with. My husband has had their street tacos and the enchiladas. He seems to always go back and forth between the two. The rice with the quesa tacos is a white rice with some sort of cheese.... AMAZING. The other dishes come with the regular Spanish rice which my husband loves. The place is usually PACKED on weekends and most evenings. I recommend the carry out if you don't want to wait. The atmosphere is very charming as well. Will definitely be returning here often.
