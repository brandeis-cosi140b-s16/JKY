This place is always busy however your waitress is always on her game and always courteous. Really should have more waitress's like this place does. Food is healthy not all of their dishes are carb loaded. I love how they prepare the Nopales. 
They have veggie & fruit juices freshly made as you order. I love their V8 veggie drink.
