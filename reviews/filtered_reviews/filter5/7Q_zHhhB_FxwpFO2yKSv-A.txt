Been waiting for the one near me to open, but couldn't wait any longer   Glad I stopped because this is what I was hoping for. Island style food with a Mexican style twist to it. The burritos were great and so were the tacos and made fresh on the spot. Great service which is a huge plus in my eyes. Glad I didn't wait any longer!!!
