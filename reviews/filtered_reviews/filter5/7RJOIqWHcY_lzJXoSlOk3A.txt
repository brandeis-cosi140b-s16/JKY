FINALLY! an inexpensive alternative to the overpriced food in Vegas.. For $2 a taco you can have authentic mexican tacos in Las Vegas..

My favorites here are adobada (al pastor) and the beef lengua

al pastor which is mexican rotissiere style meat with some onions and just a tinge of guacamole cut straight off the pig...  

lengua is amazing as well... just perfectly soft and each bite is phenomenal

this place is open 24/7 and a great pitstop to make post xs to the hotel
