Drove the distance to Tacos Atoyac based on a PHX top ten taco list. Sooo worth it. Fish, shrimp, carne asada & al pastor tacos were all superb. The latter two reminded me of Mexico City street food. But the fish and shrimp were ridic delish. Served with roasted onions, a whole Serrano, and a flavorful creamy green salsa (what was that!). Loved this spot. Easy five.
