Decided to come here on a whim on a Friday night with 3 friends...
We were seated immediately and even got the booth seats when we asked for them.

First off, we got the Elotes for an appetizer. The corn was as sweet as corn gets and all of the flavors were wonderful.
I got the chicken tacos for my entree, while two of my friends got the chicken enchiladas. We were all very impressed by the tastiness and were pretty stuffed by the end.

For dessert, we couldn't decide between the tres leches bread pudding and their pineapple ice cream. The waiter was so nice that he let us have a free scoop of the ice cream on the side with the bread pudding. The hot+cold combination was so mouthwatering and I couldn't have asked for a better dessert. 

Great food, wonderful service, altogether a fantastic experience.
