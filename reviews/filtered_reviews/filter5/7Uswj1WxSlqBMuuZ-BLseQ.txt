Outstanding food, outstanding service! Very pleased with this restaurant. Our appetizer took a little long to come out but our food and drink came out right away.
Recommend the blood orange margarita thanks to our awesome server! Will definitely be returning here again! 
Steak fajitas were on point and cooked oh so perfectly. Beef "house specialty" enchiladas....omg....LIFE CHANGING!!!!
