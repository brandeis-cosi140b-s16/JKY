This review is long overdue! After catching "year long disaster" opening for "Foo Fighters", we literally stumbled into the Pink Taco. Convienance is #1 especially after the concert was over. We both had way too many drinks at the show and were starving. So we guided by the crowd into the PT and found 2 open seats at the bar. I had water since for the last 3 hours, I was fighting to keep my drink down. I normally don't drink that much at concerts for fear of fumbling my lunch. So we order green chicken enchilada's and 7ups. These were the best I ever had. No Joke. My Abuelita was replaced in about 45 minutes of feasting on these bad boys. Beans and rice was as authentic as I ever had in East LA or at home. Sure, I was drunk off my ass but the favor was on! Mucho Saludos a los cocineros. There may be better "Mexican" food places, but if your catching a show at the Hard Rock. Stop by and have a plate of "the best I ever had" green chicken enchilladas. Next time, we are staying at the HRC since we stayed at MGM. That was a long ass walk but the things you do when you got "LONG ISLAND ICED TEA BALLS". If you don't agree, I will meet you at the 10fry & Soto St and throw down for my honor! hahahha Keep on yelping.
