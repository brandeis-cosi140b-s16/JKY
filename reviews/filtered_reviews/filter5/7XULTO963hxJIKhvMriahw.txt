I love this Mexican fast food. The food is always fresh and full of flavors. My favorites are their barbacoa pork enchiladas with extra hot sauce. I love the Chipotle style serving counter, where the person prepares your mean in-font of you. The food tastes more authentic Mexican than any other fast food restaurant. Their enchilada style burritos are also delicious. If you have one near by than please feel free to try it out. Each container is about two servings, so there are left overs for next day.
