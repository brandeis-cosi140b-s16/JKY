Me and my wife go to this restaurant at least once a week and love it. The happy hour even runs on Saturday and is a super good deal. Appetizers are half off during happy hour and are super delish. I mostly get the wings which are very good and definitely compete with your local wing restaurant. Service is mostly fast unless they are just absolutely slammed. If you sit in the bar-ask for Ashley- best waitress here and she always does an amazing job.
