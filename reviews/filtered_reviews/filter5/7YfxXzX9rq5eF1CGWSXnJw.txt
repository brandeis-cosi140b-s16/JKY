This place has excellent service and excellent food.  Their freshly made chips/salsa/bean dip is the first awesome platform to begin the meal.  I get stuck on the Green Chili Burro or the Blanco Enchilidas (bomb!).  I have never been let down from any of the many items I've ordered from here....and if you fail to order the flan...your doing it wrong.
