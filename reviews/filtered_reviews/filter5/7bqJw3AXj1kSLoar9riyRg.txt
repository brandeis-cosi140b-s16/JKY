One of my new favorite spots here in Central Phoenix. 

The Space:
So happy that Upward Projects has added the necessary parking lot among their complex of restaurants along central avenue. Granted there's the Valet available for Joyride but I'm sure none of the valets are enjoying parking an old 96' Geo Prizm :P There is street parking available as well for those of you not wanting to valet if the parking lot is full across the street. The overall space is fun, energetic, and retro. Beautiful geometric tile work along the walls, fun lighting fixtures above the bar and on the walls, a beautiful patio with fireplace, and a glass wall open during the winter months to create a true indoor/outdoor dining experience. Much of the inside of the restaurant is taken up by a large wrap around bar with several booths and tables set up around the perimeter. 

Service:
During most of my experiences I have had excellent service! Staff usually contributes to the laid-back, fun atmosphere by getting comfortable with guests at the table and engaging in conversation - not just taking our order. Every once and a while (primarily when the restaurant is slammed) service tends to lack a little - for understandable reasons. 

Food and Drinks: 
Most speciality cocktails are regularly priced at $9. The cocktails are generous pours and mostly tequila based. Fun cocktails including a cucumber-serano drink. Food has always been excellent! From the variety of delicious tacos to choose from to the large burritos the food has always been on point. My personal favorite is the Nachos with Chicken Tinga - certainly more food than one person needs but I can never stop myself!! 

Head on over to Joyride for a fun, casual dinning experience with everything to offer: atmosphere, service, food, and drinks!
