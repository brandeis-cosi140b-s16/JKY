Best inexpensive Mexican Food in Phoenix.  Yes.  You read that correctly.

It's the place you take people to when they come to Arizona to visit you.  Not fancy pants New Mexico style food (you can got o Sierra Bonita grill, also 5 stars, for $25/pp meals).

This place just delivers Mexican Food like the 70's, only better.  Chips are hot and not greasy.  Two kinds of dip.

Their $7 lunch specials are all uniformly good.  Try the chicken quesadilla lunch special if you are feeling bad, or the $8 shrimp enchiladas in jalapeno butter if you are feeling decadent, or grilled chicken salad with tortilla soup (more like stew here) if you are feeling healthy.

On Wednesdays, you must try the best fish tacos in Arizona.  NOT FRIED.  Grilled tallapia type fish, with a little cream sauce, some shredded cabbage, in a corn tortilla.  I go with coworkers and they order 5 for $1.25 each, and along with the chips, they are stuffed to the gills and only spent $5 plus tip.

Seriously... Wednesdays for Fish Tacos.  Remember.  Even if you aren't usually a fan of fish tacos.

It's tacky decorations.  It's cheap vinyl booths.  And the service is not terrific (secret... if you are in a rush, bring your bill to counter to pay, don't wait at the table).

In a city of good Mexican food, if you are looking for entrees less than $12, there is no better Mexican food in Phoenix.
