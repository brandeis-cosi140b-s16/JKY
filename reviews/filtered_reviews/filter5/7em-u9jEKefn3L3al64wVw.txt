I eat at El Segundo about once a week. I think it's one of the funnest, friendliest spots in this town. I love all the servers and the food is great. When I read the prior negative reviews from people I was a little surprised. I have never received poor service at this restaraunt! The employees and managers always have huge smiles and great energy, and the food is always amazing (especially with the happy hour pricing!) 
I think the people who say that they had a bad time here were probably having a crappy time at the mall and then brought that to dinner with them.
