Second time to a Nandos, first time to the one in Gilbert. We were very impressed with the service and food. Our waitperson, Christie, was very attentive and outgoing. Told us about the menu and made suggestions on what to get. She talked to us everytime she passed our table. What we had was very good. After we finished, she even brought us a small desert.

We have decided that Nandos will be our go to place for mexican style food.
