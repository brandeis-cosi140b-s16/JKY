Braddah's Island Style puts a unique island twist to fast food. 

Ordering is simple: first start with your base of regular brown rice or seaweed rice (brown rice with seaweed), then you have your meats (huli-huli chicken, pulehu steak, kalua pig) to choose from, then finally choose any toppings (black beans, cabbage, bean sprouts, lettuce, and sour cream just to name a few). The guacamole, of course, comes at an extra price if ordered.
Though their ordering style is similar to Chipotle's, these burritos/burrito bowls pack some serious flavor.

I went with the classic kalua pig. I usually like to have everything mixed in (including both the pineapple and corn salsas) for maximum flavor. Everything balanced out perfectly. The pork was very succulent and juicy and went will with the sweetness of the corn and pineapple salsas. They gave out generous portions here, which I found to be super filling.

The coconut bark has a weird, yet addicting sweet/salty taste. Worth a try if you have a sweet tooth after your meal. They also have Hawaiian Sun products available for purchase, which are a perfect pairing to any meal had here. What better way to wash down a meal than with a can of Lilikoi Passion by Hawaiian Sun... I'm drooling just thinking about it!

Overall, this place is awesome. Customer service was great, they have their own private parking spots, and they have a drive-thru option if you don't want to step out of your car.

You won't be disappointed here. The food's so 'ono (delicious)!
