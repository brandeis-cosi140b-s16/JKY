I was under the influence of one too many slushees with alcohol, but I don't believe I was looking through beer goggles when I fell in love with this place. To be sure, when I woke up hungover, I dove into my cold steak quesadilla I left sitting out in our room overnight, and it was still freakin' delicious. 

Found out about this gem from my friend's co-worker. It was all the way at the opposite end of the strip from us, but SO worth it! Started out with an amazing pina colada with toasted coconut on the edge of the glass. (Because the best thing to do when very drunk is keep drinking, of course. Well...at least in Vegas) Only complaint was that it was SO thick that I couldn't even get it through the straw! Had to wait til it melted a bit, and even then, was still difficult to get. For appetizers we started with chips, salsa, and guacamole. All items were SO fresh and the chips were salty and delicious. We ordered some quinoa fritters which were amazing and definitely unique! Quinoa and cheese deep friend in batter...heavenly. That's what I love about this place, they make healthy eating fun, by dipping the healthy food in melted cheese and then deep frying it. Ordered queso fundido which was perfection and probably the best I have ever had. Sooooo creamy, cheesy, and flavorful. It was a bowl of melted cheese sauce with a crunchy layer of cheese on top, which is the best idea in humanity's history. Afterwards, got a steak quesadilla which was PERFECT. The most flavorful steak I have ever had in a quesadilla. Even the next morning it was to die for. I'm happy that even though I was drunk when I met this quesadilla and took its leftovers home, when I woke up the next morning and it was still delicious, I was able to say I took home a "10" the night before. I feel like this is one of those places you never hear people talk about, but I do...all of the time. GO! The hype is real!
