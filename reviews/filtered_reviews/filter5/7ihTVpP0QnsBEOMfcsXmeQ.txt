food here is so good. Just make sure you are really hungry. The plates are hearty and heavy. Love that the door is sort of hidden. A more intimate and bar feel. If you want bigger space go down the street to Richardson's where the menu is the same. 

Shrimp appetizer is basically like a whole meal. I thought it was just going to be 4 pieces but it was served on top of a tortilla that was covered pizza style in different types of beans, cheese, and salsa.

The rib appetizer is spicy good.
