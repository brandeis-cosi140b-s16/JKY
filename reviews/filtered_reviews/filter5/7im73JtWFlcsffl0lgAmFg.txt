Yum. Co-worker brought me here for lunch and this was a great spot. They are usually jam packed and nothing was different today. They are quick to get your order and quick to get it out, but the best part is that they cook everything right there when you order it. You can go to places like Chipotle and get things out of the steam tables and they are ok-not great not bad, but you can go to a place like this and get something fresh and great for lunch. They also cater so I will probably be ordered for our office at some point.

I got the ground beef taco and chicken quesadilla and he got the carne asada taco and a quesadilla but I can't remember the meat he had, either way we were both pleased.

I was really pleased with everything and their friendly service also says a lot to me too.
