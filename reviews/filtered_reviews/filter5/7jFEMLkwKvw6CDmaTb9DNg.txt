I had Phat Phranks for the first time last night with one of my girl friends. We were both craving some great mexican food and I told her we should try this place because I always see it on my way to the gym and I thought the name was great! We both had the chicken burrito, which was REALLY good!! The salsa was yummy and they gave us a sample of their barbacoa (delicious!). "Phrank" himself was sooo nice and very engaging. He was telling us about their food, how they prepare it, and how bomb their bfast burritos are. What made this place stand out from the many other similar resturants, besides their food, was the service we received. Both my friend and I are in the hospitality industry for high end hotels, and we were both blown away by the personal service we received. We intend on going back quite often :)
