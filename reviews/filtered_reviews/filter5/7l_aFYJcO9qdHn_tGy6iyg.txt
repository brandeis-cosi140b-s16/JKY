This is the first time I've ever written anything about a restaurant, but I couldn't help but put in a good word because I LOVE this place. I've been here about five times already and I've had a good sampling of the menu. 

The place has a really hip, low-key feel. I sat next to the chef (James) on one of my trips there on a Saturday afternoon, and he gave a better description, calling it "upscale chill." Totally on the mark with that. The decor - especially the wall behind the bar is really chic. As far as everything else - super clean, great atmosphere, a couple of TVs, not too pricy, especially for the quality! Would be a great first-date, get-to-know-someone type of place. 

On to the food (my favorite part!): The chips and guacamole are just insane. So good, I don't even know what to tell you other than just to get it. 

A couple of other dishes I've had that pretty much blew my mind were the Swordfish and the tacos. The swordfish came with like a white bean gumbo that was just mouthwatering. I think I shoveled that in my mouth like I was Homer Simpson, I might not have even chewed it. 

I've also had each of the varieties of tacos they make (chicken, steak, pork, salmon) and I think I like the salmon the best. 

I've also had their flat bread shrimp pizza as well, and though it might not have been the healthiest thing I've ever eaten, it was simply incredible, and I'll be back for more of it!  

One other thing. I'm not a huge drinker, but they had a nice selection of wines and beers I liked (Pacifico!). They also make a fresh mango lemonade that I will also tell you to order. Like everything else on the menu, it went down so smooth.
