I'm very happy with my most recent visit! I had a coupon for a free Chicken Shredder Sandwich & it stated "Dine-In Only", but Stacie, that was working the cashier station, had no issues letting me take my free sandwich to go... Whoo-hoo! The place is friendly & clean & bar area looks fun & well-stocked... When I ended up eating my sandwich, it was very tasty! Fresh veggies (including avocado, yum!) well-cooked & seasoned chicken & great bread... I couldn't have asked for a better experience!!!
