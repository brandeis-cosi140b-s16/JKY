I can't believe I have lived in Phoenix for 15 years and have never been here! The food was excellent (the Mahi Mahi with mango salsa seemed to flake apart if you simply breathed on it!) It is a very small, intimate place with low lighting, Definitely would be perfect for a romantic date night. The only thing I would suggest is to sit as far away form the bar as possibly, It gets VERY HOT. If your entr√©e does not come with the green chile potatoes, do yourself a favor and order a side! Cheesy potatoes baked into a chile are the only way to go!
