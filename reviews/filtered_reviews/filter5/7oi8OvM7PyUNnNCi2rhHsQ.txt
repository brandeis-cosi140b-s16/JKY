The food and staff here are equally amazing. It's set up similar to a Subway, where you say what you want and can go down the line. There is a mixture of meat that is already prepared and meat that isn't, so sometimes it does take longer to prepare your food. The breakfast burrito is amazing, especially if you get everything on it. The staff is bilingual so that people like myself who can't speak Spanish can still enjoy their delicious food.
