Our friends have been on us to try Pedro's for a few months now. We decided to finally give it a try and holy hot dog we've been missing out on some authentic Mexican food. It was quite delicious. The staff was very friendly. We were not disappointed in the least and will definitely be back soon!! We HIGHLY recommend Pedro's.
