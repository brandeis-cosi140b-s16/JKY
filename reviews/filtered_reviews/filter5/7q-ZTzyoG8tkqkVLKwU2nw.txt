Yelp reviews did not disappoint. It's a walk up order place, lots of selections the owner offered tastings of all the different meat selections from mild to spicy (it was like a beer or wine tasting!) My favs were pastor, spicy barbacoa and carme asada. The salsas were just as flavorful. The dining room was nice, more like a restaurant instead of a cafeteria. We will definitely be back!!!
