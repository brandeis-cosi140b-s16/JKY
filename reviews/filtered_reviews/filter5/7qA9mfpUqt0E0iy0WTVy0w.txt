ERMAHGERD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This INCREDIBLE source of Mexican has been right under my nose for years, and I just tried it for the first time last week! So far the Carnitas are the best in the 480 - at least. I can't not order the Steak, egg, sausage, and cheese burrito also... yes, you heard me.. not just steak egg and cheese.. it's.... ALSO GOT SAUSAGE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not greasy! High quality meats! I'll probably be having my 3rd meal this week from Taquitos Jalisco super soon, and I'll try a few more items. This destroys all other "to's" places. Wow, just WOW!
