Possibly the BEST tacos I've ever had!! They double stacked their corn tortillas so the tacos will be less likely to break! Best filling ever! Choice of Steak/ground beef/Chicken/Chicken Fajitas with mix veg/Carnitas/shredded Beef!
Tried all except ground beef..they were all to die for! The best part was they had a whole condiment stations where they had fresh tomatoes, onions, cilantro, mild salsa, habanero, spicy and hot salsa! 
It's hidden in the hood! Right outside of a Mexican convenient store! So a landmark in finding the place! 
The make it fresh right in front of u! And at $2 each, u can't go wrong!! I don't I will ever find anything better!!
