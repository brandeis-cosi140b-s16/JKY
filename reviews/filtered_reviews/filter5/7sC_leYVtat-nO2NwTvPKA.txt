We started with shrimp cocktails, Modelo negro draft and Michelada. Cocktail was perfect and they provided plenty of limes, hot sauce, ketchup and crackers. Lastly we shared their Molcajete with a very savory tomatillo sauce surrounded with grilled fish, shrimp, chicken and beef. Lets not forget the sides of white rice, beans and salad. We will be back. The price was not bad either.
