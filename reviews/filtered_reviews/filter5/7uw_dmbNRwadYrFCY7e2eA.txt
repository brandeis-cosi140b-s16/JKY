Wow. No really....WOW. I am so ashamed of myself for not having tried this restaurant before. Especially because I drive by it all the time, ya know living around the corner and all!!!  ok, now moving on from my stupidity & ignorance. 
Start simple, chips had a nice smokey seasoning on them. Salsa was great, light, little bit o' cilantro, lime, and the perfect amount of spice. We also ordered the queso with chorizo and onions, it was amazing. Again, just the right amount of smokiness, and a little sweetness from the onion. Had to be careful, did not want to fill myself up too early. 
Ordered very basic dishes, as that is how I usually judge a new Mexican place. The rice and re-fried beans were hands down the best I have ever had. No question about it. I ordered an enchilada, and taco. Wife had an enchilada and tostada.
 Everything was very freshly made (you could tell right away) and it really makes a difference. It seems that Three Amigos really succeeds where most fall short, paying attention to the fine details (rice & beans made fresh daily, multiple times a day) and that is what really pushed me to a 5 star review. I would really like to think that this is very close to "authentic" Mexican, but I am not the one to judge that.   
Told the wife I wanted to go back for dinner, I just got the eye roll. Maybe i'll be back tomorrow, I can't get enough!!!!
