Really great food for such a tiny place. Don't blink when you drive in! (I get my car worked on next door and use this as an excuse to get a burger or a milk shake...) But I truly don't need an excuse. If you are hungry for a good burger, do NOT hesitate to check this little place out. Good fries and tacos too. Everything is fresh and full of flavor. The staff are all helpful and really friendly. Get the Stand Sauce too... My favorite meal is the double burger with fries. If you are in the mood for something else, the tacos are so flavorful you won't be disappointed. They are soft and the meat is marinated. 
Next time you are in the hood, don't miss this little family owned gem.
