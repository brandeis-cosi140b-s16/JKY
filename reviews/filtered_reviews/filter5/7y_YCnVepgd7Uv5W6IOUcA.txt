Never been to Mexico, but when I think of how the food might be, this is exactly what comes to mind. I had three tacos pastor, rice beans and guac. The pastor was incredibly seasoned, wrapped in two fresh, hand made corn tortillas and had a little cheese. came with a side of lettuce, tomato and crema but I didn't want to ruin a good meaty taco with veggies. Definitely do not judge this place by it's appearance. And in my travels, the best food is usually behind some shady lookin doors!
