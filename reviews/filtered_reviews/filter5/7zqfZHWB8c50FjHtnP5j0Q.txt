Loved this place!! Thanks to groupon we went off our beaten path and tried this place out (we are seldom west of valvista!). My husband has been on a chile relleno quest so the minute I mentioned restaurant had one on the menu, he took a left and headed straight over. 

First of all, the place is gorgeous on the inside with high ceilings, beautiful decor and nice looking bar. We came at 4 for happy hour and sat in the restaurant area, which was understandably a bit empty that early. Fine with us, we had great attention and speedy service.

We started off with a couple margaritas, salsa, guacamole and something called Papas Bravas. The spicy red and green salsa was on point with great flavor and kick...bout time someone's not afraid of spicy salsa! The guacamole was nice and chunky and those potatoes...wow. Covered in a nice and spicy red chile sauce and cooled down with a sour cream sauce, these were delish! Only thing I thought was throw some chorizo in there and they would be epic. 

We next ordered the hub's relleno. We got the one stuffed with the pork Adovada. I'm used to rellenos battered but this one was grilled and wrapped in a fried egg. I would prefer the batter myself but my husband said this was the best he'd ever had. And actually, with that tender pork inside, I would have to agree. We of course took advantage of the dessert menu and got the fried banana thing...crispy, sweet an drizzled in caramel and chocolate. Can't go wrong with that.

To sum it up, we had a great time. Wonderful food, awesome and attentive service, and we appreciated the owner stopping over to see how we enjoyed it. We will most definitely be back!
