Haha the only things I have to complain about was my Sizzling Fajita Platter not sizzling when it came out. It was hot but every one else's was sizzling, steaming upon arrival to their table. My food was good though. My BF ordered the Chicken Enchiladas. He expected a little bit of spicy since it was Chicken Tinga. Good thing our waiter (Jose E.) asked if he liked spicy after we got our food and he gave us the Diablo Hot Sauce they make in house. That was fire! But gooood haha. The other thing was, I didn't notice complimentary chips and salsa. Haha that's all. Food good, service great.
