Visiting old Scottsdale and found this place on Yelp. Decided to try based on menu and reviews. Took my son while he was visiting. We loved it, food absolutely delicious. Shrimp tamales, oyster Rockefellers and avocado bruschetta was ordered. What made our taste buds so happy was our starting dish the avocado bruschetta.  It was piled high with avocado, tomatoes, seasonings wow it was so good if you like avocados.
Everything reasonably priced too. We noticed that the staff have a great rapport with their regular customers. Great find, will definitely go back to this little place tucked away.
