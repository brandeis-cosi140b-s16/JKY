Wow. Currently in a chilaquile-induced coma. Been here a few times and I'm finally getting around to writing a review. It's smoky, kinda loud, with a butcher, bakery, market, and restaurant all in one. Today is the first time I've seen fellow gringos here, it must be catching on!

Make sure to try the habanero salsa and chilaquiles. I insist! The chicken ones are the best in my opinion. It's probably enough for two people to share as a meal (or if you're a glutton like me you can eat the whole thing by yourself and be miserable). Also had the bacon breakfast torta today--amazing! Kept stealing bites from my dining partner in crime. have yet to be disappointed by anything here but the chilaquiles are definitely what I come for.
