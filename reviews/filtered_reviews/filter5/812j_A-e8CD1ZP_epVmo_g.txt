So good! You will not be disappointed! It's a small place in a shopping center. It was easy to find. At first we were not sure what we were doing. However, the young man on the register was very helpful. He gave us samples of the different meats (make sure you ask for some). 
As soon as we tasted, we were sold! Everything we ordered was delicious! Jerk fried rice and black beans are a must! We had the Jade red chicken quesadilla and a side of Machaca! It comes in a tin (bowl style)  

We got our food pretty fast. They bring it to your table. We will definitely be back, if in town. It was also featured in Diners Drive in and Dine. I see why! You will love it too!
