Border Grill is one of my favorites because the food, service, and atmosphere are all fantastic for any time of day and any party size.  I went for brunch this time - they have my FAVORITE brunch by far in the city.  Bottomless mimosas and endless small plates of gastronomic brunch food.  My date and I ordered a few things and then our excellent, friendly server took over, bombarding us with deliciousness.  The chilaquiles (sent by the server) were my favorite, and I also loved the Jalape√±o Bacon PB&J and the shrimp and grits.  I'd avoid the bloody marys (kinda boring) and stick to the bottomless mimosas - they come in a variety of flavors and you can't beat the price.  I can't wait for the next Sunday I get to spoil myself here!
