The machaca breakfast burrito is ridiculously good less than $4.50.  Their green chile sauce is what separates this place from the 'Tos burritos joints.  Their fresh salsa is excellent too.  If you tried the place on Gilbert & Queen Creek, then you tried the wrong location.  This one on Lindsay & Pecos is awesome.
