I have been here twice now and both visits were great. I love the Salsa Bar they have with fresh homemade salsas. Both visits I ordered Taco plates. I have had the Tinga Chicken and the Carne Asada. The Chicken was much better. I have also had the mahi taco and a shrimp taco. Those were amazing. Their Horchata is delicious as well as their rice and beans that accompany their Taco Plates. I highly recommend this place. I hear their margaritas are great too. I will be back.......many more times.
