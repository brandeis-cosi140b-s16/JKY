Best Mexican food I have ever had!  We arrived early to Phoenix on way to airport and found this fantastic place in back of The Clarendon Hotel. My wife was Jonesing for Huevos Rancheros and she was more than satisfied. I had the beef burrito and it was out of this world! The fresh salsa was top notch. We had our boys and it is very family friendly as well as cool place to hang.  Service was friendly and right on the mark.  I would highly recommend this place, as I have traveled all over the world and this is best Mexican I have had.
