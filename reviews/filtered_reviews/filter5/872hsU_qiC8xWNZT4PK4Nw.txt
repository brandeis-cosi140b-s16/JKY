I have to say Ric is a great server! He and I talked about tequila and photography and food! He turned me on to Casa Noble Tequila and I love tequila and hadn't heard of it yet. Absolutely smooth and amazing tequila and can't wait to find it and have it again!
Now for the food, we had ceviche which was a little bland but good, guacamole and chips, and enchiladas (cheese and beef) It was a great experience! Will definitely go again and recommend this location to all I know.
