We've been going to Guedo's for over 20 years!  It's not your fancy, schmancy dining experience, and they don't serve microwave food!  If you want to taste fresh, tender, garlicy marinated, grilled steak or pork tacos on fresh corn tortillas with homemade pico di gallo, this is the place.  If you want reconstituted beans and ground beef, go somewhere else.  

Food is always consistent.  Servers are always friendly.  Love the place man!
