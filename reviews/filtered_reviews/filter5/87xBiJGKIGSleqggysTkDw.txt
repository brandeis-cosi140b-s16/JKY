Great Mexican food. They make their own fresh tortillas that they then package and sell (same with tortilla chips). My company gets them to cater our lunches sometimes and it is one of the more popular catered lunches. 

A lot of the other reviews are spot on, and I really don't have that much to add. If you have not tried this place yet, you're in for a treat. Try it out for great Mexican food that won't make you feel like you regret it later!
