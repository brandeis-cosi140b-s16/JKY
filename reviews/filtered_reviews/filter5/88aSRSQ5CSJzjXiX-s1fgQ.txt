I've only ordered delivery from David's. I have this unspoken agreement with local restaurants- I will continue to pay them for their food up until the moment that they decide that they don't want my money. There are myriad ways to get this point across- they could bring my food half an hour late with no explanation or apology, which of course means cold food. They could also change the quality of food for the worse, that's a big one. They could also overcharge me and refuse to apologize for their mistake. 

However, it seems that David's Hamburgers and Mexican Food wants me to continue to give them money, because the quality of the food is consistent and delicious, the delivery is right around the proposed time, and the customer service is perfect. I will continue to shove your food into the lowest hole in my head at this rate.

Also- their hot pastrami sandwich is the best I've had on this bloody coast.
