Lucky for my hubby and I, the first New Mexican restaurant that we were going to go to was closed so we ended up at Blue Adobe.  The previous Yelpers warned me not to worry about the neighborhood and exterior of the building so we didn't and proceeded.  It was a wonderfully clean and smelled intoxicating!

I ordered the green chile chicken corn chowder and the lobster tamale and portabella mushroom enchilada with an amaretto mushroom cream sauce.  The corn chowder was fantastic!  It was presented beautifully and was delicious.  Okay, enough of that...let me say that I can't imagine ever ordering anything but that mushroom enchilada again!!!  The mushrooms were perfectly sauteed in butter and the amaretto sauce is something I never would have dreamed up.  Incredible!

My husband ordered the Red Chile Pork Posole soup and a combo platter that had a bunch of different stuff on it that I couldn't pay any attention to.  I was too full even before finishing my own meal.  He did say that it was really good and would come back again.

Oh yeah, the Peach sangria was the strongest sangria I've ever had.  It had peach schnapps in it...a lot!  Well worth $7.00.
