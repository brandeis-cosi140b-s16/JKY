The building doesn't do it justice we always drive by but never stopped. Finally stopped in last Saturday night. We were promptly greeted asked if we had been there before when we said we were first timers, they promoted the samplings.  It was like a buffet of samples.Love that they do that, you know right then what you have a taste for and don't leave disappointed! We ended up getting variety of their tacos and their menudo (Friday -Saturday only.) Outstanding menudo! The salsa bar is awesome, love the green chile sauce. They let us know they have daily lunch specials for 6.99.  All the staff was friendly and nice little place. You have to give them a try you will want to become frequent visitors. We know we will!
