This place is the best Mexican seafood I've found in Phoenix! Delicious chips with two kinds of salsas, plus they bring complimentary shrimp ceviche tostadas that are superb! The Camarones Culichi, one of their specialty dishes, is OUTRAGEOUSLY good! You'll finish all the shrimp and then want to sop up the rest of the sauce with their fresh homemade tortillas! My only complaint is that the beans served with the dish were cold. If you go for lunch and aren't a huge eater, be sure to ask for the lunch portions, which are half the price listed on the menu! The atmosphere is wonderfully festive, much nicer than you'd expect from the outside, and the service is prompt and friendly. There's good reason for the numerous plaques and articles of praise adorning the walls (including a 5 star review from Seftel back in '04)!
