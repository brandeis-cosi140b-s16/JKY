This place is awesome. It's a total cluster f*ck  to get your order in, but that kinda adds to the charm. It's always packed and you will know why with the first bite. Eat here enough and you'll eventually wind up having to share a table with a stranger!! 

Don't come here thinking you're going to get a fat burrito. They don't sell them! The tacos are amazing, as are the sopes. My favorite is the adobado fries. They have this green sauce on them that is like creamy heaven in a box with French fries and pork. So good!

This is mos def the place to go when you need to feed the alcohol!!
