I love Revo Burrito!!  After reading some of the negative reviews on here, I am convinced some of these people should have eaten at Filiberto's for dinner instead (Don't get me wrong, I love some Fili-b's, but it's like comparing apples to oranges).  One of the main reasons I love Revo Burrito is because they serve food with integrity.  All natural, anti-biotic free chicken, organic black beans, lard free wheat tortillas, etc.  I love the flavor of their dishes.  And after trying whole wheat tortillas at every restaurant that offers them, I think that Revo's are far superior.  Guacamole is great, chicken machaca is always tasty, their cheese blends are unique...and I really do love their 'hot sauce'.  It should also be noted that they participate in the SouthWest rapid rewards dining, which is always a plus!!  I am a big fan of Revo and hope they are many more restaurants with Revo's thinking to follow.
