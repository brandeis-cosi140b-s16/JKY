No doubt about it, this iteration of Tia Rosa is a five star joint.  Tonight our party of 4 ordered 4 very different dishes.  I myself had my favorite the chile rellano and again it is the best in town.   My BIL had a mole dish and raved about it.  The interior resembles the Tia Rosa on McKellips (now gone) and the menu benefits from the relationship.

Our server was Katherine and she was spot on.  I don't know how other Yelpers would give a super low rating; I mean what's not to like here.
