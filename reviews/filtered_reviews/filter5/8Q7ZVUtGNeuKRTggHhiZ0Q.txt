This place gets 5 stars for the excellent bar staff. I've been here a few times since opening. My friend absolutely loves this place  like ranting & raving about them... Until this visit I thought they were ok, about 3-4 stars.... But they just secured that final star and I'm so glad I waited to review. 

First my only real complaint from the first few visits was that it was really difficult to find out what kind of meat I was getting on my tacos. I'm allergic to pork, I know, I know The Horror! Anyway, my pork allergy puts me on edge when I don't feel confident the cooks understand what I mean by "I do not want any pork!" 

I had been complaining to my bf that if only they could update the signs to show what kind of meat.... And low and behold they did! Yay! It is was less stressful for me to order and try new things now. 

We decided to sit at the bar, and what a treat! The bar is small so if you ever get the opportunity, I say grab it! The bartender (completely forgot his name - cute young, hipsterish kinda guy) is awesome. He's fun, friendly and very funny. He made me this delicious pumpkin pie shot... Yum! Consider me converted.
