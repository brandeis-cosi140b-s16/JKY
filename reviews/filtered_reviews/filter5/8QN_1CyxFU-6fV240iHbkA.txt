MMM MMM Great.  High-end Latin food that makes you think your in Chicago its so good, but not the city pricing.  
The menu is high brow, and smart, but the look is casual.  It's a treat that you can get food this good, but wear jeans!
I have only eaten there a few times (okay, more then a few because I hate to cook) and the staff has remembered me from day 2.  
In a town with a LOT of restaurants, this is a huge stand out.  
Why go eat crap on North Prospect when you can go here!
