The service was impeccable and the food was the best Mexican food I have ever had.  I went there with several friends before the Katy Perry concert which was taking place at the Garden Arena right across the way from the restaurant. It was all very convenient and easy. The price was not terrible and average for eating at a restaurant on the strip and for the quality of food you get it was very reasonable!
