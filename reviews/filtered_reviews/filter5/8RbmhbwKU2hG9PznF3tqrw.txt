Probably the best carne asada and margaritas on earth.  

The meat is fresh and a good cut.  It's been marinated perfectly and grilled over an open flame shortly within your order being placed.  I was hooked on the first bite.

The salsa is so fresh and delicious.  The perfect amount of spice and sweet and you can tell it is probably freshly prepared daily.

Don't even get me started on the Jamaica Margarita.  It is so damn good, I wanted to bathe in it.  I ordered two of them the first time I went.  I girl behind the counter came out to ask me if the margarita was good because she had just made the batch fresh before I came in.  I told her the only problem was the glass was too small.

You have to try this place.  Everyone I know loves it and I didn't know it even existed until a few months ago.
