We stArted with salsa and chips!!! The habanero salsa is on another level! We love hot food so this was amazing
Main entrees were tacos, Javier's salad and Asa Buco.  All three were great!
The tacos had grilled chicken with a special green salsa on top which was delicious. It had avocados in it.  The salad was the perfect sized with grilled chicken and cucumbers 
The Asa Buco was tender and had lots of flavor!
