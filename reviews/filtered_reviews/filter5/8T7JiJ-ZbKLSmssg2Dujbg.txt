Wowza, I've been to Pedro's several times and each time was great but today it better than great!  I enjoyed a green chili burrito smothered in green chili.  It was delicious.  There salsa wasn't spicy enough so I mixed some of the hot with it and it was delicious!  The chips were perfect!  I know that might sound funny but very few restaurants have chips that taste this good!
