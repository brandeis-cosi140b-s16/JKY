Amazing tako(octopus) taco! They grilled fresh octopus just right. It's not rubbery or chewy. It melts in my mouth and crunch chickpea gives extra joy in texture. Fresh aromatic greens make me think if I'm having artisanal taco in Bay Area.
Carnitas taco was good too, chicharron adds light crispness and jalape√±os gives a mild kick. In my taste, it was a bit salty, but otherwise very tasty.
Yuzu strawberry drink was so refreshing and great. I was worried that it might have artificial strawberry flavor, but no! It was delicious with all freshness. 

My staying in Pittsburgh is short this time, but I would love to try their tako taco again!!
