Right next to Sapphire strip club. If that doesn't exactly appeal to you, please don't let that turn you away. Non GMO, organic, gluten-free and vegan options available. The healthiest Mexican food I've ever had, hands down. Chips and salsa were good. They have three salsas; the habanero is amazing. I had the strawberry agua fresca, (they have a different flavor each day), it was refreshing and not overly sweetened, perfect flavor. Their coffee is rich and freshly brewed. Portions are pretty big, my boyfriend and I shared Paco's Mole Sampler. The chile verde chicken is to die for. The cilantro rice was THE BEST rice I've ever had---full of flavor and so deliciously soft. The refried beans had a nice spice. At this point in time, I was already satisfied. Our server then told us that if we check in on Yelp, we'll get a complimentary dessert...the flan. Okay let me just say that I was never too crazy about flan. I've always liked it, but I've never crazed over it. Now let me say that I have been waiting over 12 hours to properly describe this flan in hopes that my words do it justice. IT WAS THE BEST FLAN I HAVE EVER PUT IN MY MOUTH. I wanted to cry after the second bite, it was so good. I was so happy. I have never tasted anything so freakin' delicious. My exact words to my boyfriend were "I want you to look at me the way I look at this flan." Honestly, words fail when it comes to this flan. There are no words. Get the flan. Your life will never be complete until you have had this flan.
