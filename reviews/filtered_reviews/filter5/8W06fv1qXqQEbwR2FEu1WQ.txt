So many poaitive thoughts come to mind while I think of Canteen. The extremely friendly bartenders Sunny and Jessica, the fantastic happy hour from 4-6:30 with half price tequilas, and the amazing tacos. 

Canteen is a legitimate player in the local food scene, and it comes to us from MILL AVENUE?????? Yup, it's true, a grown up reataurant on mill. Go here.
