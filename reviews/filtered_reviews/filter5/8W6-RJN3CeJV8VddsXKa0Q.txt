My fiance is orignally from New Mexico and ever since we've been together (5years) he always always talks about green chiles and how much he misses new mexico style cooking. Me being from California Ive only had mexican food that's been Cali-forni-a-ized, although a year ago my fiance started school in AZ and him and his mom (who also is from new mexico) found this place and fell in love with it.  They told me about it and so on my next trip down to AZ I went and Aye Dios Mio its magnificante! I love! this food, and not only that but their margaritas! WHOA! After eatting a meal like they bring you its hard to finish it. They bring you chips and salasa and BEANS with Green Chilies in it omg the beans are soooo good you forget all about the salsa. 

The only 1 bad thing was when I went one time and they had $1 margaritas during happy hour they tasted as if they were virgin margaritas, I know sometimes I dont look myy age so I asked the waiter if it was a virgin and he said no, and I said to just take it back and get me a big one then cause the 2 ppl I was with as well as myself didnt taste a drop of alcohol in that thing, 

But with that being said I still gave 5 stars cause Ill go back anytime!!!
