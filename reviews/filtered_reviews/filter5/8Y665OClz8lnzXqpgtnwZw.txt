Best meal I've had in a long time!  Once we got past the neighborhood and into the restaurant, we knew we were in for a treat.  We starting with the guacamole with pomegranates and terrific margarita.  I loved the twist on the guac.  Then the real highlight was the Chiles en Nogada. Our waiter recommended this dish.  Reading it on the menu, it didn't sound good, especially because I don't usually care for cream sauce.  However, this is one of the best dished I've had in the USA.  The combination of flavors was truly outstanding!  We also had the slow roasted pork which was delicious, but not nearly as unique as the chiles.  

Then to top it off the deserts were insane.  We ordered the chocolate cake and the churros. Hands down, these churros were amazing!  The decadent carmel sauce was rich and a perfect accompaniment for the churros.  These were even better than Rick Bayless's churros in chocolate in Chicago. 

All in, my husband, who's a big foodie, and I had one of the best meals we've had.
