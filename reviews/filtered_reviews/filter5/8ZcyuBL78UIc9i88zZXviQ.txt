The most delicious meal on my recent trip to Phoenix.  The homemade tamarindo was incredible and the guac was fresh and tasty, though the cranberries messed with my mental expectations to the point of distraction.

For those vegetarians out there who don't cheat with fish like I do, try asking for the chile relleno without the seafood.  It came piled with roasted veggies and the cheese alone should be enough to satisfy.
