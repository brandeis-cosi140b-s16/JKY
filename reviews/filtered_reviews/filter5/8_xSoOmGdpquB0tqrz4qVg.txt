I went back Sunday afternoon for brunch. I noticed that they decorated the venue and had a Dj. Both added a nice energy to the experience. 

I went with the $15 bottomless mimosas, it turned out to be a great value as we stayed there for a couple hours. I tried the healthy breakfast as I am trying to lose weight. And it was amazing!! Great flavor and very filling, especially for a healthy choice. The service was impeccable and the manager, rob, even brought our table a happy birthday churro Sundae!! 

I can now say el Hefe is my go to spot in Tempe!
