Stumbled across this gem accidentally today for lunch with 2 friends and loved it. We had arepas, tacos, empanada, quesadilla and chips with queso and guac. ALL of it was delicious (and my bf confirmed it was good leftover as well!). The place was cute. The service was excellent. Can't wait to go back! Thanks!
