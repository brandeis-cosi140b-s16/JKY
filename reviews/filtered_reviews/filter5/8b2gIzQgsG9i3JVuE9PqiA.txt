Had the Bandido tonight via take out and it was fantastic!  That much flavor in one glorious round container is almost too much joy.   Love love love love love their food, every item I try is good.  The black beans probably have magical powers.  I had gone to bed, left just a couple of spoonfuls for the next day, but only made it an hour in bed before having to get up and finish the beans.  Yes, they are that good.  And now I find out you can also order a small salad to balance the carbs?  If they had delivery, I would not be able to contain myself.
