If you are looking for a hidden gem of Phoenix, La Santisima is definitely one of those places!!

The decor and vibe of the place is top notch. Even though it is a bit small, it has a bit feel on the inside. The decor is not over the top and for being a taco shop, has the ability to seem a bit classy.

The biggest thing that would sell anyone on this place is the salsa bar. Every type of salsa you can think of. Some ranging from really hot to super mild. Some specialty salsa as well made form guacamole, cashews, and fruit. You can definitely chow down a few baskets of tortilla chips trying all the different types of salsa.

I ordered the Azteca Tinga Burrito. It came out really quick and was huge. The burrito itself had an amazing flavor on its own, but I added some of their salsas to spice it up a bit and it made it even more amazing. The chicken was cooked very well and was very flavorful. Even the beans and veggies in the burrito had their own flavor to it.

I am looking forward to visiting this place more and more and trying as many different items on their menu as possible. Not to mention all the salsas!!
