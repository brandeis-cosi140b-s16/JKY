First time here, on the recommendation of other yelpers! I must say it was delicious!!! Big BOLD, spicy flavors :) 

I ordered the Guacamole del Barrio to start, it didn't came with pomegranate seeds as seen in other yelp reviews. It came with dried cranberries. It was still fresh and had balanced flavor! I also ordered the Organica Margarita. It was very crisp and refreshing and a decent pour of tequila! 

For lunch I decided on the Kuali de Camaron. I saw a gentleman at the table next to me with this order and I was sold on appearance alone. It had bold, spicy and VERY fresh flavors! Large enough to serve as a main dish for me. My guest ordered the Pollo Panlano. It was opposite, creamy and fresh taste, it was a large dish. It came with a side of the chipotle mash potatoes and grilled zuchinni. They did have a Sunday brunch menu until 3 and had a live musician until 2pm. 

The restaurant is rather small and very busy, so they were a little slow with the service in the beginning until the servers caught up, but our server Jamie was very pleasant and apologized for the delay. 

The artwork (murals) on the exterior walls were beautiful. And the artwork hanging inside was great too! Overall great atmosphere and amazing food! Can't wait to come back and try more!
