Soooooo goood! 

Tacos El Gordo started as Mexican Fast Food in Tijuana. There are now locations in San Diego and Las Vegas. Now, these aren't fancy restaurant tacos, this is fast food. Tacos El Gordo is precisely Mexico's version of McDonald's. Unhealthy, greasy, and DELICIOUS.

When you walk in, there are taco stations making different types of tacos. Each meat comes with a unique blend of sauces to enhance the flavor. So, for example, carne asada comes with guacamole, adobada does not. When you order your tacos, they'll ask if you want everything on it, if you say yes, they give you all the sauces that are recommended with that meat. I also ways go for "everything on it," haven't been disappointed yet.

Tacos are $2 each. It's simple, it's fast, and it's yummy, yummy, yummy.
