I have been here two times and each time was scrumptious! The decor is really cute and they have mason jars at the table holding silverware. Extra point...bc I love mason jars. Now on to the meat of the matter..literally. The oxtail is amazing! The meat is tender and the flavor burst into your mouth with every bite. The dates are good and so is the calamari. I am a girl that loves my sauces and the 3 sauces that come with the calamari are really good. The Sangria is yummy as well. Look for groupon deals so you can get a bang for your buck. Overall...Toros Spanish Kitchen & Gaming will def be in my restaurant rotation!
