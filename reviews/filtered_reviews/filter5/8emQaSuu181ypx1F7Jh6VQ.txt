Love burrito shack. Don't ever let the looks of it fool you. Great food, nice people and did I mention great food?!?!

I was skeptical about going to the Burrito shack at first, but once I did I get it pretty often. I have not tried many things because I am stuck on one burrito because it is so good. The service is always friendly and even when the wait is long they still get your food to you as fast as possible and my order is always correct.
