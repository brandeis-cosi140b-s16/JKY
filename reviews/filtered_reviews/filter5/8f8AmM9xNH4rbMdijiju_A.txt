This is the best Mexican food I have ever had...anywhere...ever! The chips and bean dip are good. Fajitas are amazing. Delicious home made tortillas. Table side guacamole is a must. Carnitas are yummy. They have a good Mexican Cobb salad too. 
I am not a big fan of their margaritas, they taste a little like cheap tequila to me but I have gone with 3 other people who love them so it must be I am used to sugary low on tequila margaritas. We are always too full for desert but I plan on trying it sometime. 
I will admit there are a few things there I do not like. Their salsa is too spicy for me and my boyfriend but we are wusses. I ordered chicken tacos a la carte before and they weren't any good, hardly any flavor. I ordered something when I was drunk which I thought was going to be like Pollo a La Crema but it was not and it tasted slimey and almost made me puke, but it was an authentic Mexican dish and I was a drunk white girl. 
It is all in what you order. Great service, very friendly, and fast. This is the only Mexican restaurant I will go to.
