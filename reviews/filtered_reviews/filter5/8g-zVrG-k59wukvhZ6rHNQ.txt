Oh chipotle...how I love you. Your chicken makes my heart skip a beat and the medium salsa is a love letter written for my heart. 

Sometimes you jip me on my chicken serving. I flash you a dirty look, vow to never see you again, but I always crawl back to you in the end. 

You tease me on days where the line is too long and there aren't enough people working but atlas you created an app for me to communicate with you that I have no time for your games and must eat now otherwise my hangry stupor will ruin my love for you. 

Okay that was silly, but seriously...I love chipotle.
