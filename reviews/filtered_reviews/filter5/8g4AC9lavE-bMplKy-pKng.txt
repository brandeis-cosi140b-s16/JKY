During a girls' weekend in Vegas, we got tired of the continuous gluttony of the buffets and the fake-ness of the strip and decided to try some 'local' place.  

We somehow found ourselves in the parking lot of the strip mall where this hole in the wall joint in located.  From the outside, it didn't look like much.  But when 2 cop cars pulled up next to us and entered this place for lunch, we were sold.  Hey, the whole point was to see where the locals were!

We had a great time talking with the staff and just hanging out in the place.

The potato tacos were fantastic!  Must try!
