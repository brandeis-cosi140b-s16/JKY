HIGHLY recommend this place if you enjoy some New Mexican cuisine in your life. 

The chips and salsa are a great way to start it off- my only complaint (if there is one) is that the salsa bowls aren't big enough! That's ok, it helps me save room for the entree, which is worth saving room for!  I have had the blue corn enchiladas,  which are great, and this last time I had the adovada burrito Christmas style - wow! So flavorful and so tender. Food like that keeps you coming back,  that's for sure! Oh and the black beans were great too... Unfortunately I didn't have enough room for the rice but my fiance had no trouble finishing it up! I saw their orders of nachos (which you can also get with adovada) and they're definitely big enough to share. 

I know they're also a tequila bar but I haven't tried any- yet. With food like that though, I know I'll be back and maybe I'll give it a whirl next time!
