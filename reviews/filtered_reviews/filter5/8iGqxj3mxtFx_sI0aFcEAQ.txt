If you are looking for a GREAT family owned place to get some excellent Mexican food look no further!  This place is awesome from the authentic selection of meats to fill your tacos and burritos with to the handmade chunky guacamole that is made for EACH person as they order it right in front of you!  The owner Rudy himself is always nice and welcomes you with a smile.  The restaurant is staffed with his family members and they are always quick and very helpful.  The carne asada is some of the best I have ever had!  Not much seating inside and they do have some outside but we usually just get it to go and enjoy it at home.  They have AMAZING tamales but don't always have them in stock so don't forget to ask!  Overall this is one of if not my absolute favorite place to get a burrito and some handmade guac!
