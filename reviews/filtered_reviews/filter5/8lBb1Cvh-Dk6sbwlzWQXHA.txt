I have passed this restaurant on my way to and from work everyday and never thought to try it until I read the Best of Phoenix and they described Hibiscus Enchiladas.  My friend and I just left and we both agreed we need to tell people about this place. We started with Spinach Quesos Fundidos  a great cheese covered appetizer, I got the Hibiscus Enchilada and my friend had the Chicken Enmoladas. It was all just delicious! Jesus our server was a gracious host, checking on us throughout the meal and thanking us for coming in.  All in all a great  experience, the food very fresh and served  warm, the atmosphere and service are both warm and welcoming. If you haven't tried it, I suggest you do!
