I have never had a bad experience at Abuelos. We have tried their fish, steak, drinks... You get it. This was one of the first places we ate at in the valley when we moved here 7 years ago. 

My favorite is the Ribeye and enchiladas with The Grande as a close second. My wife loves the Tilapia and the Alhambra de Cameron. The Sangria should be purchased by the carafe, don't waste your time with having to reorder. :) 

So long story short, great food, good for families, visitors and large groups. Enjoy!
