I came here by myself on a Thursday during happy hour, since sadly none of my, "friends" had the time or desire to join me!! :( 
Well, they missed out!!! This place is perky, colorful and clean.
I had the chicken tacos from the HH Menu as well as a Prickly Pear Mojito and that was spectacular, and to top it all off I indulged myself with a Milk Chocolate Tres Leches Cake. and that was just okay!!! I've made and had way better ones'!!! 

Overall, great little place. and hopefully next time I will bring someone along!!! 
My server was great, She was very attentive and well knowledged on the menu items!!! Great place!!
