My wife and I have been here several times using the restaurant.com. Each time is better than the last. This time I don't think I could have avoided writing a mediocre review. I was just so impressed by the professionalism, and food that this review was unavoidable. 

I had a Beef Barbacoa Burrito ($18), chips salsa and guacamole. Susan had fish tacos and corn on the cob (I forgot the price). The final amount amount was $70 minus the $35 for the certificate = $35 for the both us. 

The reason I said this was unavoidable was because at one time my drink was almost empty, Susan was empty. I turned around to look for the waiter. I looked up there he was with two drinks. He must have been reading my mind. 

On top of it all I didn't have to fight them to get the check. 

Very smooth process, Great service, Great Food!
