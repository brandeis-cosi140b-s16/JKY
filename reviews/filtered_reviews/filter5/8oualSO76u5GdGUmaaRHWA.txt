I've been in a lot of Tex-Mex places and this is by far one of the best ones. I tried the Regular margarita and it was on point, not sweet at all ( I can't stand sweet drinks) most places they sell you margaritas with 10000% sugar -not here. The food was great, it is limited but great selection.. I've had real tortas when I went on vacation couple of times in Mexico and they are almost like the real thing! Try carne asada torta by the way...
