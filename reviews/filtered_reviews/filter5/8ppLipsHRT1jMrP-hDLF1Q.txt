Man alive...I just ordered from this lovely place and had it delivered because I'm stuck at work. It's so nice to have places besides pizza and Chinese that deliver. 

I ordered the - Taquiza Cilantro. Yes, it's huge. It's 1lbs of meat. I got 1lbs of carnitas and I didn't even eat half. I'll bring the rest home. 

Everything was freaking delicious. The tortillas, rice, toppings the grilled peppers...yum.

I don't have much else to say since I didn't go to the location, but that was an excellent deal for $24.95. 

I will order or go in MANY more times.
