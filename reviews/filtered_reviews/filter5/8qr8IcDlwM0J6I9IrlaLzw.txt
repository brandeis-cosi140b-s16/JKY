A gem of a find.  We were treated so well here by multiple waiters - we visited a few times for lunch.  Wait staff is incredibly accommodating, friendly and eager to please - say hi to Jose and Eric for us :-)  Food was fabulous!  Definitely order the guacamole - fresh, fresh, fresh; and even their chips were delicious!   Great variety in the menu for a Mexican Restaurant - tacos were terrific, and so was the Quinoa salad!
All-in-all, an excellent value - something that is not terribly easy to find along the Strip, (outside of fast food)!
Highly recommend you visit!
