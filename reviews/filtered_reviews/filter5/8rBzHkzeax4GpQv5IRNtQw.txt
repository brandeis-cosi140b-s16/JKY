I LOVE TACOS AND TEQUILA!!!! 

If there is one restaurant we tried in Vegas this past trip that we both won't shut up about and we keep telling our friends now heading out to Vegas that they have to try - we're always talking about T&T. I'm seriously in love with this place and I wish there was one closer but since there isn't one closer I can only wait until my next trip out. 
Service was good, food was amazing and we shared a Conga (margarita with 2 upside down Coronas in it) which was definitely a showstopper. 
I ordered the pollo tacos which came with marinated chicken, cilantro, onion, lime and salsa on a corn tortilla and the boyfriend ordered the baja tacos which came with beer battered tilapia fish, chipotle slaw, pica de gallo on a corn tortilla. These were AMAZING!! I couldn't get enough - I wanted to order more but I didn't want to be an extreme fat ass haha The meal comes with three tacos, rice and black beans. The chicken was extremely juicy and the tilapia was fried to perfection - I think my chicken tacos were better but of course the boyfriend thinks his fish tacos were better. 
Our server was very friendly, quick and made sure we were happy the whole time we were there. They don't actually serve the Conga in the restaurant but it's made right across the walkway at one of those stands and the server went over and grabbed us one. He took our order and 5 minutes later our food was out which was great because we had to make it to The Lion King show in Mandalay Bay. He checked in on us to make sure we were doing good and he brought the check out promptly when he seen we were finished and ready to head out.
