My girlfriend lives in Lake Las Vegas and we wanted something close by. PS-there isn't much, let alone on a week day. The area is a ghost town, we were SO thankful this place was even open! 
To start, the chips and salsa were delicious. Not only were they hot and fresh, the salsa tasted home-made-yuMMMMMMMMy! Did I mention how fresh the salsa tasted? I ordered the shredded beef quesadilla and it came with beans and rice (price was $13.95). The quesadilla had a lot of flavor. Cheese, beef and green chilies (not hot) were oozing out of the crisp tortilla. I was actually quite impressed and after all was said and done an didn't mind the cost for something that would normally be cheaper. I would definitely go back again if I was in the area.  Close, fresh and tasty!
