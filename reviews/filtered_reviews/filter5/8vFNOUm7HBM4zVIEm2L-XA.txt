This is the best carne asada I have ever had!!  It is the embodiment of perfection when it comes to carne asada.  Get extra meat if you order a burrito, it's just a dollar more.  Or get a bunch of street tacos (they're $1!!).  The quesadilla (with carne asada of course) is out of this world.  

The line is LONG on weekend nights, especially late.  I'm not sure what the hours are, I believe it is just late at night.  I have waited over an hour for this.  I have left (extremely disappointed) when I knew the wait would likely be quite a bit longer than that.

More than one person has told me that they don't particularly like carne asada in general, but this place is out of this world.  I'd give it more than 5 stars.
