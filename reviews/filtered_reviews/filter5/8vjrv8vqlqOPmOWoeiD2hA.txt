In all the years i have been eating here i have never once experienced a bad meal or service.  I absolutely love the vibe of this place and it really is the only place in town that i would stand outside for more than an hour to get into.  Sure, if it's packed you can just get in your car and drive a couple miles north to Rokery J or Richardsons and i highly suggest you do so i can get a seat faster.  I really love the food and the people that work here top off the experience.  Sitting there today and watching the chef prepare meals was like watching a great musician play his or her instrument.  It was so fun to watch in fact that i was moved to write this long overdue review.  Thank you Dick's hideaway.  If you weren't here i don't know what i would do.
