I'm not one to review very often, but this place is hands down my favorite restaurant I've ever been to in my life. I'm an arizona native and like to think I know a thing or two about Mexican food and this place has perfected it.

Must try: cochinita pibil taco 


Their whole menu is great but that taco alone I could eat every day of the week. 

Don't pass this place up!
