We came here for a wedding after party, the service was beyond amazing! The owner personally came out to check on our party and make sure everything was to everyone's satisfaction, we even let them know that not our full party was going to be able to attend and they said it was no problem the patio was ours, they went above and beyond everyones expectations! Food was amazing and portions were OMG!! Free refills on horchata, what?!?!?! Amazing! Bean dip with the chips and salsa, yea buddy!!!! Yummmmmmmy!!!!!
