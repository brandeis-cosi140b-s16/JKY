So I pass this place all the time. I was happy to see a new place take over the space. Well, on a whim, I decided to go here with a couple friends to try something new. Beautiful restaurant interior and atmosphere. Big and you don't feel crowded or that people are eavesdropping into your conversation. I had a WONDERFUL server that far exceeded our expectations. Chips and salsa, plain amazing! The food portions were HUGE, and for a great price in my opinion. I got a combo and I had so much, I had lunch for the next day at work. I got to try my friends dishes and they were nothing short of delicious. That is passionate food right there. I cannot wait to go back. In these times, I don't usually do 5 stars, but we just had such a blast and was so surpised at the quality of the food and presentation, they deserve it.
