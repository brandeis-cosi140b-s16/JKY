Amazing food, amazing service (our waiter Kai is the best!).. Definitrly the best Mexican restaurant in Vegas and also the best compared to what we know in SoCal..! Besides, the place is very nicely decorated, good music; great Margaritas!! Everything perfect; guys keep up the great job!! We can't wait for our next time!
