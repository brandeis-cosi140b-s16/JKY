To people who don't live in Mexico and are not Mexican like myself, this place really is a treat. I can definitely see orthodox Mexican people who see this place as "nothing special" or its "ok" but I think this place is awesome. I usually line up at the offal counter, which I see the least amount of people.. People have no idea what they are missing. My favourite among the offal tacos is the tripa the texture is unbelievable, and what seemed to be a "salsa rioja" was perfect for it. Cabeza taco was my next favourite, I loved it because I am a fan of artery clogging, "eat it in moderation" kind of foods. This taco had a very soft beef flavour presented shredded and chopped, served with I guess a salsa verde sauce and cilantro if I remember correctly. I then had the tongue taco, which was okay, not my favourite texture, it had a slithery like texture going down the throat which was interesting. Beef brain taco was an experience; I would consider it to look clumpy and the taste was very neutral, it was somewhat rich and cooked fork tender. Moving on to the standard meat tacos(San Diego location), my favourite was the steak. It had a pleasantly chewy texture, served in strips, I think it has again the salsa verde cilantro mixture and I cannot remember if it was spicy. Tacos adobadas was also delectable, the pork was crispy on the outside, cooked nicely on the inside. Unfortunately I do not remember the sauce or the ingredients but I do remember they all worked in harmony. It's been a while since the San Diego location so I cannot remember the others I tried, but everything was perfect.
