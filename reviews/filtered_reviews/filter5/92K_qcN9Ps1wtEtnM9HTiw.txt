We found this location with the help of yelp. Hubby and I have been looking for a mexican restaurant that wasn't too American. Anyways this place was amazing for our first time. We went to eat breakfast and i had chilaquiles verdes which came with 2 eggs, beans and rice. And let me tell you they were delicious and spicy. I love spicy but this made my tummy burn. My hubby order a chimiganga with carne asada which came with beans and rice. His plate was huge we paid a little over $20 and it was perfect!  Definitely will come back and recommend this place!
