My favorite latin food restaurant in Vegas thus far.  it was very romantic/classy but we weren't at all frowned upon for wearing jeans and a t-shirt.  It was overall a great experience and the fact that we parked a little further away made me happy cause we got to walk around after a great meal.  We weren't supposed to but we started browsing around the world market center and window shopping through various showrooms.  Then we got kicked out very nicely.  haha.  The food at the restaurant was fantastic though!
