These reviews don't lie.  This is probably the best Mexican food you'll get in the valley.  It's the best in the West Valley anyways.  Chimmies are excellent and the hot sauce they give with order is really good.  Not too hot, not too mild, but just that right temp for me.  Staff is really nice too.  My wife stopped there to pick up an order and they helped my wife carry out the order to the car (she was holding my son at the time and only had one hand free).  Carne Asada Burritos are really good too.  The beef is cooked perfectly and they use really good seasoning with it.
