Came to Sol last Wednesday for the 1st time, and I must say that I was very impressed by it.  First, they give you complimentary chips (more like home baked seasoned tostadas) with fresh salsa and bean dip.  You can tell that the salsa is homemade, so it was a nice start to our meal.

We also had 2 specialty tacos (which were delicious) and the pork carnitas.  Let me tell you, the carnitas were out of this world good!  Slow roasted and oh so flavorful....I was seriously considering taking whatever man or woman made them home with me so I could have more at my disclosure!

But the main star of the night was definitely the service.  Our server, Sarah, was absolutely sensational!!  You could tell that she was busy (it was pretty packed in there), however she took the time to explain and recommend the dishes, and even gave us a brief tequila class.  I have never had a server that was so passionate about tequila before!  It made me really want to learn more about the pairings , process etc that tequila can provide, so I definitely plan to come back in order to delve into this some more. :)

Overall, good food and outstanding service!!  Can't wait to go back to enjoy the food and learn more about tequila!!
