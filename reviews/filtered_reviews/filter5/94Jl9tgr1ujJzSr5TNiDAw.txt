Came here for lunch yest.  Right from the get-go I liked this place.  It's been awhile since I had to parallel park.  The outside gave a cozy feel to it.  I wouldn't expect it around this side of town, took me by surprise.

Walking in, I was greeted by Una hermosa, Gladys.  The waitress, who i found is the daughter of the owner, suggested I try the Carnitas, since it was her grandma's recipe.  Simply delicious!!! The plate was topped with chicharron, and the pork fell apart with my fork.  Also tried the chocolate cake, which was very thick and rich.  

Would definitely love to come back and try the tamales.
