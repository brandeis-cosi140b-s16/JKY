I came here on a Saturday night with my girlfriends.  We waited approximately 20 minutes for a table but not bad compared to everywhere else around there which were quoting an hour or more wait!! We were seated outside and the ambiance was so relaxing.  We ordered nachos, one of the burritos, guacamole, and each ordered a taco!! The food was absolutely delicious!! Good food with good people made for a great night!! Will definitely return in the future :)
