In spite of the reviews here, this place still seems like a hidden gem. The place itself doesn't look like much but the staff is very friendly, and the hamburgers are some of the best that I have ever eaten, in all of my life.

I'm fortunate enough that the place is close to work and I've been there a few times with co-workers and we usually all order the week's special. The pictures make the special of the week seem almost randomly put together but once you bite into it and get all the flavors together, you realize that the chef is a genius.  We have not been dissapointed by anything that we've eaten there.  We'll keep coming back to try the new specials.

As much as I dislike Guy Fieri, I have to thank him for finding this place.
