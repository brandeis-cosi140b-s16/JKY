We saw this place and decided to try it out for New Years Eve. Being newly opened (a week I think), I was prepared for the restaurant to still have some "kinks" but we were surprised! The seating for the tacos and smaller plates only has room for 18 inside, but more outside. The other section with an expensive, but good menu was empty. Not sure how this will play out in the future, but we wanted just street tacos and smaller plates. We were sat outside and the staff was over accomodating to move one of many heaters near us which made the ambiance fantastic. Old style Mexican music was playing and the staff was very prompt. The drinks were strong, food AMAZING, and someplace we will go back to soon! My husband even left his phone on the table and our waitress, Amie, called us from it, to have us return. Honest staff! They even have a weekend breakfast menu as well. I would highly recommend this place, and hope they expand the seating. Moderately price, AUTHENTIC Mexican food. Delish! They are open until 3am on the weekends, so pefect for late night snacks!
