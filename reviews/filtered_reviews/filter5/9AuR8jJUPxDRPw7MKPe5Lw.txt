I went with a Groupon, I brought the kids from my daughters Band, got 3 large orders of Nachos (I think its 3 or 4 dollars more then the regular size, I dont know why they dont price it on the menu like that?)
 OK anyway, The service was as good and as friendly as you could possibly ask for, I had 3 -15 year old boys who swore they have never had better Nacho in their lives and want me to take them every week now LOL.. 
 I know, I said my daughter's band, So your probably saying what did she think? well when I ask everyone if they wanted to go I didn't realize my daughter had other plans, So she didnt go and Im stuck with her friends(LOL all great kids)...Any way I don't get all the Bad reviews? The place is Friendly nice clean with good food, what are the other people looking for that I missed?
We had Spicy Shrimp Nachos, El Traditional Nacho and Nacho Average Burger Nacho,, I figured the last one had to be good since it had Nacho in the name 2 times. ha..ha..ha  
Oya My wife Got bottomless chips and salsa with a side of Guacamole, Some of the BEST Salsa,,,,Really some of the best Salsa I ever had!!!!! And when it comes to Salsa, I am smarter then everyone else!!!!So what I say is true LOL The Guac was GREAT too....GO THERE !!!!!!!!!!! DONT Listen to the bad reviews 
I would have gave it 4 stars But Im giving it 5 to make up for the undeserved crappy reviews
