Good mexican food at a great price conveniently located near the Charlotte airport.  Simple as it gets.  

Service is friendly and food is good.  All of the other reviewers do a good job of explaining the ins and outs of this place, just thought I'd chime in with a solid +1

Don't come expecting fine dining, expect to get good home cooked Mexican food.
