This is my favorite restaurant in Arizona.  The food is very tasty with average portions.  They make everything fresh so there is no "slop spooned out of a bucket" like you'll find at a chain.  The carne asada burritos and chicken quesadillas are unbelievable.  We were actually going to have our wedding on the patio, but they jacked up the price at the last minute so we backed out.  But we don't let that ruin our opinion of the food and elegant atmosphere.  The place is PACKED on the weekends, so be prepared to wait.  

REVISION:  I ate there last night for the first time in a year.  The prices have skyrocketed.  Apparently the owners have gotten a little greedy with their success.  A $6 burrito last year is now $12.  While I still highly recommend this place, it is now more expensive.
