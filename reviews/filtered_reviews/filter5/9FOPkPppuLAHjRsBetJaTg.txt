Another visit and tried some new dishes...always great food and attentive service. Our server, Larry was especially helpful today...thank you!  I had the Chili Relleno with shredded beef, a chicken enchilada and the rice and beans and all were perfect.The trio of dips sampler before hand was especially good today. Great place.

Topped everything off with a slice of key lime pie and texture, taste, temperature and presentation were perfect.
