Totally a hole in the wall but oh so good! The decor is outdated with very cushy booth seating but the service is quick and friendly. We got the bulgogi burrito that was huge that I shared with my bf. The galbi tacos were delicious and packed that I made 2 tacos since there's 2 pieces of tortilla. My bf said that this was by far the best galbi tacos that he's tasted and we're from LA! 
Did I mention the homemade chips with the yummy guac and salsa that they first bring out? YUM!
