I definitely recommend Santos Lucha Libre...I am so happy I decided to try this great little spot. I live right by them and am excited to have a great go-to when I'm craving Mexican with a slight twist.

I was greeted by a very nice woman with a great, inviting smile. (I'm assuming she's the owner.) she knew right away that I had never been in, and got right into giving me samples of all of the meats. They are all DELICIOUS! I opted for the 3 tacos (chicken, pork and beef) What sets them apart are the topping choices. I was excited to see roasted corn and pickled red onions, 2 of my favorite things. Never thought pickled red onions with Mexican, but it works amazingly well. 

Not only was everything fresh, but the tacos were beautiful with the vibrant colors of the pickled onions and other fresh toppings. I couldn't wait to get home and dig in. Now that I'm full, fat, and happy I can say without a doubt I will be returning here more often than I would probably like to admit. Under $10 for 3 tacos filled to the brim and a soda? I could barely finish 2 tacos and will be happily wrapping the 3rd for lunch tomorrow. I can't wait to go back and try the other options! Highly recommend giving this place a try!
