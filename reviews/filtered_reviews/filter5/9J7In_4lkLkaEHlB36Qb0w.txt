I found out about this place on the Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives app. I started with a margarita which had a hint of jalepeno, fresh cilantro, lime, and a small orange slice. It was one of the best margaritas I've ever had. Next, I had the spicy pork street tacos with beans and rice. It was absolutely amazing. The staff was very friendly and didn't mind answering questions. Awesome find!!
