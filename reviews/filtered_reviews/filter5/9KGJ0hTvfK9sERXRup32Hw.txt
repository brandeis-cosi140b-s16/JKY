Wow. Food here is simple, yet delicious. I didn't expect to find a place like this here, thus the 5-star. Guacamole was made right in front of us. Street corn had just the right amount of seasoning. And taro fries were unique! Pumpkin bread pudding also did not disappoint. If I lived here, I would definitely come back.
