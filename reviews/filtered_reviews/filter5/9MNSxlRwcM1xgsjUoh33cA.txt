Great authentic Mexican food made by Chef Paco!  You can tell that all the flavors are so unique and real, chef Paco makes us feel like we are back home. I love Mexican food and this is by far the best food I ever have on my life. 
Highly recommended they have lots of specials and they are open 24 hours!!!  
Try the flan, and the chile relleno,  also the shrimp bowl is a must.
