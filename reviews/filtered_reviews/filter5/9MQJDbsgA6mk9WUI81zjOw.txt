I discovered this place when I was 10 years old, I fell in love with it right away.  I see people complain about the rice and beans, guess what its called Fajitas and not Rice & Beans.  I am now 33 and live in NYC and I make sure to go here within the first day or two of being home visiting.  Shrimp and chicken fajitas are the best, not to mention the salsa and cheese crisps.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!
