We tried their french toast fries, and their special burger of crabcake burger, sweet potato tatter fries, and their regular fries. 


First of, customer service was wonderful. That's where the extra 2 stars comes from.

Burger patties was perfect. French toast is good, tatter fries is good. 

The only let down was their burger crab cake. Although it has great quarter pounder burger patties, while combined together, the whole thing tasted like it was made by a cook than a chef. It was a great concept: the white sauce was a creative creation that sounds good on their chalk board but the way they made, unfortunately doesn't live up to the expectation; it was just bland. Crab cake was over fried, and bland too. Bun was not moist on the inside and savory on the outside, like the way it looks. 


BUT...
Guy Fieri was here so you may ignore my chatter above...
