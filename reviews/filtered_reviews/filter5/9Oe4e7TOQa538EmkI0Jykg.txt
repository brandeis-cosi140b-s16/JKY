I would move into this place if I could. Wouldn't even mind giving a hefty security deposit. Every time I come here I end up staying for 4-5 hours because it's the tits.  Good Segway into my next comment, it's next to Sapphire strip club so if you get too bombed off of their delicious margaritas you can stumble next door for some zesty entertainment. The margaritas have no sweet and sour, they're made fresh to order with agave (the way all margaritas should be made). If I could purchase an IV and flow this stuff into my veins I just might. Defiantly maybe. The guac is amazing (and also made fresh to order) and the chicken street tacos, I could talk about those gems for days my fat friends. All of their ingredients is organic, the staff are super friendly and you get to walk through a curtain of beads (like from the 70's) when you need to tinkle. This place is defiantly worthy of 5 stars and for anyone who disagrees, I'd say they need a swift kick in the ass.
