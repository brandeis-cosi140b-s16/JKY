We walked by this place a couple times.  Always smelled delicious and was obviously popular based on there always being costumers at all times of day and night.  So we decided to give it a try for a cheap dinner.  Glad we did!

To order, you walk up to the counter.  Read the signs because each section is for certain types of meat.  First time thru we ordered tacos de asada...the guy who prepared them was friendly and fast!   They were so yummy that we went back for more and decided to try the al pastor and the chorizo.  Delicious! 

With sodas and 3 tacos each, we paid about $15.  Really good deal for really good street tacos!  We'll eat here again for sure.
