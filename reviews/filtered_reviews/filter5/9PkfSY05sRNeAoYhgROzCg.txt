What a great experience for lunch, the food was great as was the service!

I got the combo fajitas which was easily enough food for two, my wife got three Tacos. 

The food was served promptly, we also got a free flan for checking in on Yelp plus 20% off for a military discount on our bill.

I'd highly recommend stopping in here for great (non GMO) food, at a very reasonable price!!
