First of all, it's not "mexican." The menu includes funky grits, Spanish tapas style patatas bravas, and then well-loaded soft-shell tacos that are filled with tons of delicious ingredients. Martinis were great, they've got good wine and beer, and the food was SUPERB. Great atmosphere. You can fill up a little on chips and then eat a taco or two or a taco and an appetizer -- sampling around a little. Everyone at my table loved their food, and I'd totally recommend it.
