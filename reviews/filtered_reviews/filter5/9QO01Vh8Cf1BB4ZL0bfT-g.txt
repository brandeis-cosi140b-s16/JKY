Really enjoyed everything about this place. The atmosphere was great and clean (including a nice clean restroom). The margarita I got was really good and the food was outstanding. I had the Jala Holla steak which was very tender and perfectly spiced. I ordered this off the gluten free menu so I believe the enchilada was prepared a bit different than normal, but it was delicious. I am not a huge fan of shrimp so they exchanged it for chicken which was very tasty. Also want to mention that the waitress was very attentive, helpful and pleasant.  I only wish it was a bit closer so I could go there more often. :-)
