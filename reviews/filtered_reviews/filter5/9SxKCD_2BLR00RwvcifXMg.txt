I had lunch here today and they are some of the best carne asada tacos I've had in the valley. the meat's super tender, and the sauces are very good. I definitely recommend getting it with the grilled onions and peppers. its always busy here, because the quality of the food is so great. I definitely recommend checking them out if you're looking for some good, quick, healthy, delicious Mexican food.
