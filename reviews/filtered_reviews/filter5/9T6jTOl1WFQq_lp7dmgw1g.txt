What can I say about CT that hasn't already been said.  We've been coming here for 10 years (and have even been to their former Scottsdale Rd location) and they put a great spin on New Mexico cuisine.  Their carne adovada is my favorite in town and their outside patio is great in the season.  Have been to all the New Mexico places (Los Dos, Richardsons, Secreto, Arriba) and this is definitely our favorite (although Secreto in Ahwatukee is good too).
