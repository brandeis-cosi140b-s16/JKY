This place has the best tacos and burritos. They have at least 12 kinds of meats to choose from, and they prepare it fresh to order. You order your burrito and they melt cheese on it before they add ingredients! Amazing. After you create your burrito, you can head over to the street taco stations where you have fresh tacos made to order. The salsa bar is super extensive and they have a huge variety of fresh salsas.
Everyone here is super friendly, and they even gave us some samples of some of their meats since we told them it was our first time there. Everything we ordered was delicious, so you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They also have a nice vegetarian menu, which is pretty awesome. This is my favorite authentic mexican food in Vegas.
