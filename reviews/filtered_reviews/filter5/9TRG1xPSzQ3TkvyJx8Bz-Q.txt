So my family and I went to this little burger  joint after reading the awesome reviews on Yelp and driving by numerous times. Thank you yelpers! You didn't disappoint!!! The atmosphere is very cool. Fresh ingredients all around. The owner, this giant who has to duck to walk out of the kitchen, strolls around the front and back of the restaurant and HELPS his staff. We ordered a burger a piece a couple baskets of fries to share (huge portions) and two salted dulce shakes, I opted for diet coke and to try a taco. The burgers were off the chain!!!! They were juicy and flavorful! The shake was so thick it came with a special tube(not a straw) to suck on! The taco was dry , but if u like a good rubbed beef taco u will live it. I went really for the burger so I'm still happy. As we are the giant owner came out and chatted it up with us. You could hear how proud he was of the place and his desire to serve fresh , good tasting food to HIS neighborhood! We will be back!!! 
Definitely a stop you must make when diving through Arcadia.
