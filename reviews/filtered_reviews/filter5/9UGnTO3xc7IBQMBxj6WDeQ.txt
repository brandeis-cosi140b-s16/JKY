Light, sophisticated mexican food. Trendy, chic atmosphere, friendly, helpful service, reasonable dinner prices. It is located in the historic Clarendon hotel. Be sure to check out the roof deck on your visit as well as the story of Don Bolles' murder displayed in the hotel's hallway. 

My boyfriend has frequented this restaurant for many years and he finally introduced it to me a few nights ago. He always orders tacos and we decided to split a torta in addition.

The Cochinita torta was fine. He enjoyed it more than I did. The meat is well seasoned and tasty and the avacado adds a nice creamy note. I found the bread to be a bit on the dry side. 

The really stand out menu items are the tacos. Very simple and light. The corn tortillas are fresh made, light, and airy and hold up well to the fillings. The cochinita taco again was well seasoned but mild and is garnished with fruit. My favorite taco was the carne asada beef. Oh my goodness it's amazing!!!! charred yet tender beef in the most amazing marinade. The complex flavor is somewhat sweet and tangy, yet robust. I can't wait to eat it again! 

I look forward to sampling some of their cocktails next time and my friend raves about their kale salad.
