The best breakfast burritos EVER!! I used to be an avid Filibertos fan but ever since I went to Los Favoritos Taco Shop, I have never went back to Filibertos! Me and my wife have been going here for years I love their chorizo
 breakfast burrito, and my wife gets a shredded chicken bean and rice burrito she loves it, I love it. Nice quick fix in the morning or even in the afternoon if you're into breakfast for dinner, we are! All in all, a great place to eat, great prices!! Good job guys!!
