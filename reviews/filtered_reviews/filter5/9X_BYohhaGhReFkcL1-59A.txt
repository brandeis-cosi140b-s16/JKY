Aunt Chiladas is amazing!! I had the chicken pechugas. They were really good. Melted cheese over a chicken enchilada. The beer was really cold and the staff was amazing! Marie, the bartender was telling me the history of the restaurant and how the place has a haunted history and that following prohibition, they were granted the first liquor license. Everyone was really friendly and it really felt like a home town bar in the neighborhood. I will definitely be back when I am in Phoenix. Big props to to Marie!
