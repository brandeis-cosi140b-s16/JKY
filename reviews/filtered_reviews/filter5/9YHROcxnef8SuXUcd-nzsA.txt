Huge portions, recommend splitting a meal.  Authentic Mexico City food.  I recommend the carne asada burro with green sauce and a Mexican Coke.  It's in a sketch area of town for a gringo like myself, but so what.

The Pina Colada is by far the best one I have ever had in my entire life.  The fruit juice bar is no joke.
