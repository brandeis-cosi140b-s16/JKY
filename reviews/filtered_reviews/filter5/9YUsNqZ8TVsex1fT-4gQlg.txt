Best green chicken enchiladas I've ever had in my life!! The side of guacamole can get a bit pricey but it better be award winning because the flavor is unmatched by any other guacamole I've tasted. Have a mango margarita with a chile rim to go with your meal and basque in some if the finest Mexican food this state can offer!
