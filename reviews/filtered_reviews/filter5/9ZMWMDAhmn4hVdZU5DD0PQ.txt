We absolutely LOVED this place (even with our Groupon deal)!  

-Great Food 
-Great Service 

Only con: Parking - some street parking available 

Price a little on the higher end, but totally worth it!  

I don't usually rate places with Groupon deals this high, so it says a lot for a place...
This is our Favorite Mexican restaurant so far in Las Vegas...hands down!
