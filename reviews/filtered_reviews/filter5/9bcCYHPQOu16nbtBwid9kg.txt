So this place has hand painted walls to ceilings (they kinda remind me of Caesar's Palace in Vegas). The chips and salsa are awesome, ambiance is great, service and the food is very good. Not what I consider authentic Mexican but it's very good food indeed. Must try dish: Pollo con Calabazas (marinated grilled chicken with zucchini and cream sauce with rice and your choice of refried or charro beans...go with charro)
