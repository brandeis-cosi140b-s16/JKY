What a great venue!

I had never been there before until last night. I went to see Jarabe de Palo play and I was so impressed.

They have an outside seating area but the inside's also very cozy and welcoming. Our server was very attentive and very nice. Also very professional. 

The food they serve's AMAZING! I got a couple of tacos and they were to die for! I  was pleasantly suprised by how delicious the tacos were! They have a good selection of food and drinks during happy hour and that salsa verde they serve with their chips ($1 during HH, unbeatable! Tons of chips, too!) is so, so, so good!!

Parking is the only issue I have with this place. I'm not sure they do own a lot but you can park on 3rd Ave and Van Buren as there's a big lot there. Just make sure you have cash, $4 to be exact, because it's one of those parking lots with numbered lots where you deposit money on slots.

All in all, it's a very cool place! I really enjoyed the concert and the venue's just great for a concert like that. Location's great as it is Downtown Phoenix and they have a nice Happy Hour. I understand now why this is such a popular place.
