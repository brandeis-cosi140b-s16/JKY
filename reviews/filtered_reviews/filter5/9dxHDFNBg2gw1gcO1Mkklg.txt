Located where The Republic Kitchen used to be. This place is a little slice of heaven, and this review is not for the faint of heart. I went on full Andrew Zimmern, I had the brains, intestines and tongue, thats right I said brains, intestines and tongue! This was the first time I have ever had brains, not quite what I expected but very good. Tongue I have had many times and I am a big fan! I have never had intestines before,these were so good that I am not sure but I think I dropped an audible F bomb. I say stop by and try some of the more exotic items on the menu. Save the chicken for you second visit! Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!
