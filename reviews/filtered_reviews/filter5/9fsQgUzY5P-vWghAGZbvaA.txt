Been here over and over again! Best tacos in town and maybe in IL. This place is a much. 

The guacamole is superb and you get a large helping. 
Staff was friendly (as always). 
Prices were fair and make me feel like it's about quality over making bank. 
The food is authentic and fresh. 

If you just visiting or just in lunch break... Go here.
