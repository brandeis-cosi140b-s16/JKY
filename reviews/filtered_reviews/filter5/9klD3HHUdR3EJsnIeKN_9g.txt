Amazing like always.  Not American tacos, REAL tacos!  Like everyone is mentioning, keep a close eye on which line you wait in.  Secondly, have patience while they prepare your food.  If you want something faster, go elsewhere.  One of the biggest things to note is you must ask for salsa while you order.  Otherwise there is no salsa bar.  So is it worth the trip to leave the strip to visit this place for food?  OF COURSE IT IS!!  Always remind yourself, there is both good and great food on and off the strip.  What is always for sure is that whatever you get on the strip will be more expensive.  Nevertheless, Tacos El Gordo keeps it real by giving you food without the Vegas hassle.
