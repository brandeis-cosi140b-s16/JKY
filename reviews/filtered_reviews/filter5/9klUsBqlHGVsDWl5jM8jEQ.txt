We have been coming here for years. It looks like a hole in the wall but once your inside the experience starts. One of the best Mexican places in Vegas. We moved to Summerlin and still make the drive to eat here. The service and food are amazing! The prices are great and the portions huge. Also love the chips and salsa! Highly recommend trying this place.
