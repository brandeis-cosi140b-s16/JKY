Barrio Queen is quite possibly my favorite place in Scottsdale. The food is amazing, the margaritas are strong, the service is great and the patio is perfection. We find ourselves there every month or so. I always get something different. The tacos are awesome but kind of on the small side. I could probably eat 10. The quesadilla on happy hour is fantastic. I ordered two. The enchiladas are yummy and filling. The house margaritas (on happy hour for $3!) are perfection. All tequila shots on happy hour are half off so it's a good way to try new kinds with out opening your wallet wider than you'd like. I wish they would bring back the goat cheese and shrimp quesadilla though. It was hands down the best thing on the menu. When we have friends come to town, this is the first place I bring them. Usually just for an afternoon happy hour to relax, sip margaritas and try as many items on the menu as our stomachs can handle. 
When we stopped in last week, our server, Maggie, was super helpful with picking out a few tequilas and was very nice. The service is always great and on point.
