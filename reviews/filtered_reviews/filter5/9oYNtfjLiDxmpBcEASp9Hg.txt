Best tacos in Vegas. Been countless times and I can't stop. Al Pastor taco's are a must have for sure and to be honest is what I usually get so I can't give to much insight on the list of other tacos. The Carne asada tacos and fries though are also amazing. I know my Mexican food and promise you it won't disappoint. 

If you want something quick, authentic and delicious then this is the spot. Good prices, quick service (although there is often a large line), and delicious food. Both locations are at par to me so don't be shy by this ones location next to a gas station.
