Stopped here for a quick snack before departure flight. The service was fast and the food excellent! The guacamole was very fresh with cilantro and red onion. Chips were warm, which is always a plus, and the salsa had a nice smoky flavor. To top it off the micheladas were cold and refreshing! And it was great listening to the gondoliers serenade in the canal.
