Great food, great prices!  Please note that this is a place for FOOD, not atmosphere.   Lots of people do take out here (as I do on my way home from work).

The combinations of Chinese, Mexican, and even a little Jamacian (I love their spicy Jerk Chicken) are endless.   While I would not call the food "traditional authentic", the uniqueness of their dishes and the way the menu combines flavors is really unique.  If spicy isn't your thing try their Emerald Chicken.  It has a wonderful Ginger flavor that is very pleasing to the pallet.

They will let you sample pretty much any entree.  If you like black beans, theirs are excellent.

I try to watch my carbs so I have stayed away from the rice, and instead just get their salad (which usually has a little shredded cheese on it).  I always leave satisfied.

The food is as 'good as it gets'...
