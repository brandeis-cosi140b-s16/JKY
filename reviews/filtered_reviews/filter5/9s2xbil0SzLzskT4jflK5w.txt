Hands down the BEST fish tacos in the valley! They only have one location but its worth the trip! The battered fish tacos are crispy, not soggy and not too much breading. You get to top it off with their awesome salsa bar full of fresh limes, cabbage, cilantro dressing, chipolte, or avocado sauce! their grilled taco is also delish, a must try!
