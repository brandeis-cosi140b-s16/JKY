Love Maverick Rock Taco! This place is a hip trendy atmosphere with a rock n' roll twist. Say hello to street tacos done an American way. The parking is a little cramped for my style, but once you enter this restaurant you will forget all about the parking. My favorite tacos are the Carribean Chicken tacos. Definitely try the green rice & mango slaw. Two of my favorite side dishes. Top your food off with an ice cold beer or a margarita. My boyfriend & I at least come here once a week. We love the food because we never feel that Mexican baby belly once we live! Great place for kids, parties, or to just socialize with friends. They also have t.v.s hanging up so those sports fanatics can watch the game! Afterwards go bar hop down Montford!
