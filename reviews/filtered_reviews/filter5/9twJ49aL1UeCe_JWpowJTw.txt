Outside seating however only a few tables. Obvious good service. Great bread started with sangria and a mix of bread some jalepeno some cinnamon. Calamari was fried, large, and excellent. Larger than anything else we have had locally. Dinner was the talapia with a honey glaze and chile sauce. It was also good. The chef poured the corn cream sauce on half of the talapia. A simple and wonderful idea that let us enjoy the dinner in different ways. The side vegetable mix was great too. Obviously cut and cooked right before the meal. The better half had a steak with a port reduction sauce. Same fresh vegetable mix. Note, I mentioned to the waitress I do not like peppers. Without asking she made sure there were none in my dinner vegetables. Good, thoughtful service. Wine menu was OK, but would not stop us from coming back. Easy parking. Outside seating.
