I go here as a splurge for lunch, when I work in downtown. It's totally worth it! Fresh, locally sourced, and quality. This hole-in-the-wall used to be the Two Hippies Pizza shop, then it was something else, then it turned into Macho Taco. The parking lot is small, so be prepared to circle the neighborhood if they are busy. 

Awesome customer service & super quick.
