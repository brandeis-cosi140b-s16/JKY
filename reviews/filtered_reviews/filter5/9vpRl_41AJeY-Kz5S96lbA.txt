I LOVE Los Taquitos. 

I'm there every Monday and always get some sort of combination of shrimp and chicken street tacos, chips and salsa and a Mexican Coke.  No matter the combination, it is never more than $12.... and would be cheaper if we went for $1 Taco Tuesdays.

The food is flavorful and spicy, and the service is excellent (we're big fans of Jessica).
