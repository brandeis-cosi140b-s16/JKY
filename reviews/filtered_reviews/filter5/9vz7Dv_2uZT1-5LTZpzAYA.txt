Best Mexican restaurant in Madison.  Although it is simple and in a strip mall, la mestiza prepares great, moderately priced traditional food that is closer to Rick bayless than tex mex.  both the green and brown mole are great.  I am enjoying enchiladas in a bean sauce as a special as I write this.  Bar minimal but the make a fine marg, too.
