We have been here twice. Our first experience was so enjoyable we had to come back, and Taco Guild has become a new favorite for us.

We met managers Justin and Garth who were both funny, knowledgable, and hospitable. I appreciated that they both visited the table to check on us, and get to know us.

I asked Justin about the history of the church, and what led it to becoming this restaurant. He really seemed to embrace the history of where this building has been, as well as its present, and where it is going. It was nice to hear that the former congregation has been supportive of the transformation. A lot of local memorabilia has been donated and is on display, including pews for seating. It is very community driven here from the decor to the draft list that is all from Arizona (I liked the Porter). The stained glass windows offer great lighting, and the atmosphere in general is vibrant and fun.

They have so many deals here. Happy hour M-F from 2-7, and 11-6 on the weekend. If you order 3 tacos, you get a side for free. They offer all you can eat tacos (I think on Mondays) DJ on Fridays, live music on Saturdays...

The first time we came was a Friday night, which is a louder, adult setting. Lots of fun. Our second time we brought kids at 5:30 on a Monday which was much more calm and quiet. They don't have a kid's menu, but they made us a chicken and cheese quesadilla, perfect. 

Overall the food is flavorful served in good-sized portions at a great price point. The new Ono taco was my favorite with a delicious coconut slaw, and the grilled Romaine salad was filling and tasty with the shrimp.

Taco Guild is definitely worth checking out, and we will definitely be back!
