Who LOVES locally owned, family run businesses? And who toots their horn loudly when it's warranted? THIS GIRL! And El Ranchero in Wickenburg is about as good as it gets. Sure the decor is rustic and a tiny bit tacky, but what GOOD, AUTHENTIC Mexican place doesn't have these qualities? What will make you come back is the food. And oh how I enjoyed the food.....

Our group of 8 was seated promptly and greeted very warmly by the owners as though we were old friends. The chips and salsa were excellent; and not just because it was chips and salsa but because there were two different heat levels as well as a fantastic bean dip that were just waiting for a warm, perfectly sized chip. 

We enjoyed chimichangas, enchiladas, street tacos, and even taco salad ranging from beef to pork to chicken and every single thing we had was DELICIOUS. My baby had a cheese crisp that was about as awesome of a cheese crisp as I've ever tried. And it was ONLY a cheese crisp for goodness sake! It was really THAT good. Another great thing is that if you are trying to watch the added calories that refried beans can add to your plate, they will substitute black beans for you instead! 

Our drinks were kept full, our plates were served hot and fresh, our entire crew was treated like family. I.cannot.wait.to.go.back.to.El.Ranchero. SOON!
