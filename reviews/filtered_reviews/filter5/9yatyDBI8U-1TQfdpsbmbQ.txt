My husband and I are addicted to New Mexican food.  NEW Mexican.  This place is so perfect for a date night or a foursome.  Bar seating is great, wait service is **ALWAYS** perfection.  If you don't want the ambiance of Richardson's but still want the good food, this place is it.  However, it is SMALL, and the seating goes fast, so manage your own expectations you might not get a seat.  That can be a real disappointment if you are craving carne adovada like I do from time to time.  The stool seating can be a little uncomfortable after a while if you are short like me.  So ladies, wear your heels so you have something to grip on to.  Ha.
