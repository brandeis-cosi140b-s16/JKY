We had a really good dinner here and will definitely be back. It is a small place, but there is seating in the back, so do try it. We were there early and got right in, but it was filling up by the time we left. I had the chicken enchiladas verde and my dining companion had the burrito mexicana. Prior to our entrees they brought us chips and two different salsas. I am a fan of heat, so I loved them both, but the hotter of the two maybe too intense for some. Our dinners came with rice and beans, and they there both delicious! Everyone that waited on us was pleasant and cordial. After we got there we noticed they prefer cash because of the service charge, and I felt bad we only had a card. Note to self next time bring cash. I love frequenting local places, and this is one we will definitely be back to. Tasty, flavorful food and good prices.
