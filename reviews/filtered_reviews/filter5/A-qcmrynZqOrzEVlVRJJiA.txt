Located on the edge of Mesa and Chandler lies this gem of a small town Mexican restaurant. The food is authentic and delicious. It's owned by a family who still has their deep roots in Mexico and brings all the traditional flavors back with them. If you are feeling adventures to try something other than their delicious bean and cheese burrito, I  recommend the carne asada torta.
