Ay, que sabroso! Dinner was so awesome, my friend and I returned the next morning for breakfast. I visited Phoenix this weekend and enjoyed an incredible happy hour (La Paloma, which is El Jimador Reposado, Grapefruit Soda, Fresh Lime and Salt and another drink which was a play on a margarita). The drinks were refreshing and tasted of quality ingredients. 

We chose guacamole as an appetizer. It was definitely made with fresh avocados. It was slightly bland, but my perspective is a bit skewed because my sister in law is from Mexico and makes the most bomb guac in the whole wide world. Period. So I'll say that the guac at Gallo Blanco was good, but not as good as my cunada's. 

We ordered a plethora of tacos, including La Cochinita (local pork marinated in slow braised Achiote, garlic and guajillo), Carne Asada, Veggies, Fish (grilled tuna) and shrimp. 

The next morning, I enjoyed delicious coffee fresh from the press. I had the Torta with chorizo and avocado, my friend had the omelette and the pancakes. We were advised that the pancakes are incredible. I wasn't even going to try them because I normally detest pancakes. However, I caved and wound up stopping myself at the 5th bite. I don't know what they put in there (crack?), but those are some kick butt pancakes. 

I forgot to mention that the decor is very modern and trendy feeling. The soundtrack was definitely hip. Great date spot or ladies' happy hour!
