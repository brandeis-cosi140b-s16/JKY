Nachos. I only get the nachos. I don't try anything but the nachos. The nachos are good. The nachos are sooo good! 

In other related feedback, the staff is what pushed it up to the 5 star mark. I never cared to go back when I first tried the Tex Tubb's 3 years ago. But tried it once more on a family suggestion and it is now in my top 5 of Madison and am a monthly regular. I should note that Mexian food is my comfort food--a strange thing for a Gringo who grew up 1500 miles from the border. Now this is mostly Mexican and tex-mex inspired food and may not meet the note of some purists but it does all the essentials very well. The salsa and guacamole is good. The pork is fantastic! To clarify I get both the guac and pork on the nachos and would strongly suggest you do the same.
