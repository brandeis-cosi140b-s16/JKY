This is *hands down* my favorite Mexican food I've come across in Tempe. The staff is extremely friendly and pleasant, the place is clean, and there is usually a good crowd but never a long wait. 

I've ordered the asada burrito each time I've gone. It's too good not to get! 

Don't miss this place!
