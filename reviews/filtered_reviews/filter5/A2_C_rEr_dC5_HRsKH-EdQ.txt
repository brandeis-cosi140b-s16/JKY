Had heard great things about this place for a few months so last night decided to check them out.They are closed Sundays and Mondays so keep that in mind and they close I believe at 9:30pm on the days they are open....... I had shrimp and carne asada tacos and my bf had the carne asada burrito and the fish tacos. The tacos were really good not the best I had ( best I had was in Chicago) but they were really good. The shrimp tacos were not too small which is something I see every time I order shrimp tacos elsewhere.  But my bf absolutely loved the fish tacos he ordered. The burrito only had pico so I would suggest asking to put guac or whatever else you like in your burritos. 
The service was great. The owner/manager was very polite and helpful. The place needs a little tlc but if you can look past the decor you will not be disappointed. I will be returning to this place really soon.
