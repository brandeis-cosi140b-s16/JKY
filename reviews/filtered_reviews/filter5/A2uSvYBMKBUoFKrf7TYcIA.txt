This had been one of my bucket list restaurants to try and it did not disappoint. 

Came here for my wedding anniversary on a Friday night at 6:30 pm and was worried that we would have to wait. I tried to call twice and got the answering machine. We had a half hour drive so we decided to go for it. As we were on our way my wife was able to call them and they said about a half hour wait so I thought let's do it.

As we got there I saw an empty table and were seated right away. Bonus!

Nothing fancy for the decor but a home feeling and nice and casual.

Was brought to our table and quickly had a basket of bread and salsa. The bread was so soft and the salsa was an olive base salsa which was awesome. 

We started with the Fresh Guacamole with Pomegranate Seeds which was prepared on a cart in front of our table. The waiter asked which ingredients we would like to add in and then he mixed the guacamole in front of us. Excellent and fresh! Would highly recommend. 

Wanted to order some of the traditional mexican food such as the street tacos but ended up going with what the waiter recommended and was not sorry for what we ordered on recommendation. 

We shared the Pescado Del Mar and the Filete Mignon Tita. 

The Pescado Del Mar was a filet of Halibut topped with shrimp, scallops and crab, and a shallot of white wine cream sauce finished with longaniza chorizo sausage and Carmelized onion.

The Filete Mignon Tita was prepared as requested and was one of the most tendor filets I have ever had. Also came with a chipotle mash potatoes that was excellent. 

We finished with the Churros Rellenos which were 2 churros with a large scoop of ice cream topped with caramel and candied pecans.

What a great evening of dining and celebrating a special occasion.
