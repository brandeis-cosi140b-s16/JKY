If you are looking for good Mexican food, don't come here. If you are looking for great Mexican food and authentic atmosphere this is the place. The exterior of the building at this location just looks like almost any other building. But once you walk inside you can see the love put into the decorations throughout the interior. I have been to many Mexican restaurants that go way overboard with decorations to look authentic and just look like stereotypical.

From the moment my wife and I walked in we well taken care of. We were seated quickly. Beverages were brought quickly. And we never lacked for a quick refill of our drinks. Our waiter was very friendly and answered all of our questions. This is some of the best service we have received at not just any restaurant but anywhere.

Go to any Mexican Restaurant and you will find the menu loaded with Tacos, Burritos, Nachos, Enchiladas, and Taco Salads. Lindo Michoacan has some of these on the menu, but they are a very small portion. Some of the items on the menu are Pollo al Mojo de Ajo, Chili Verde and Colorado, Camarones Rancheros and much more. My wife and I ended up ordering the same item. We both got a Chili Lime Chicken. This came with a side of beans and rice and also came with flour or corn tortillas made on site. They came out fresh and hot. They were full of flavor and complemented the rest of the meal. The chicken was flavorful as well and
had the right amount of tang with the lime squeeze. So there is Mexican food and truly authentic Mexican Food. This is the real deal and now my favorite Mexican Restaurant.
