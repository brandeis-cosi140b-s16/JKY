One of my favorite places for lunch but be warned, it gets crowded! The salsa bar is awesome and offers a large variety of sauces. I love the creamy green sauce that is sometimes very spicy. The spicier the better for me. The authentic tacos are always a win and on Tuesdays you can get dollar tacos (chicken, ground beef, veggie or black bean). I love their queso, the nachos are enough for like, three people and the staff is always friendly and helpful when it is crowded.
