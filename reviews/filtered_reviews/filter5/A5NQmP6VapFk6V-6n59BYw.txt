This is my absolute favorite Mexican restaurant in the whole valley. Family owned, even "grandma," waits on tables.

Their house margarita is great!

Chips and salsa, fast delicious and bottomless.

Service is quick and efficient- we never have to wait long

It's an old and wonderful building with a unique atmosphere... It's just the best!

I will keep coming back!
