Came in for the elote and al pastor burrito. We were quickly greeted by a girl and Khai who was very helpful in assisting us with our selections in our ordering. We were also able to check in online using the Yelp app for a free order of chips and salsa so that was nice. 

The food arrived and didn't disappoint either! I love the elote (mexican street corn) here and the al pastor is some of the best in town. I also like that you can combo your favorite selections with rice and beans for a small upcharge. They have mexican coke in the bottle on ice as you step up to order so that is also something I like to see in your neighborhood taco shop. 

Overall-great food and great staff.
