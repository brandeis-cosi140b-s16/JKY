I'm from New Mexico and was raised on Hatch green chile.  Since moving to AZ I had given up on finding Mexican food that suited my taste buds.  This place completely satisfied my picky cravings.  The salsa was fantastic although next time I will ask for a hotter one.  They have a gorgeous patio and open till 2:00 am!  I will be back.
