Phat Burrito is a great little place.  The burritos are extra large, reasonably priced, and unique.  The seating is ample, with an outdoor patio for nice nights.  There is even a parking lot!  Extra perks include Coke products (fountain) and a salsa bar.  Finally, the staff couldn't be friendlier.  We'll be going back soon!
