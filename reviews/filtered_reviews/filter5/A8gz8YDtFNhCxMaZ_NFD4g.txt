I love PINK TACO! My favourite place for Mexican food in Vegas.

I've tried numerous other Mexican restaurants in Vegas and this place always wins. I love the environment, the servers, and of course the food.

The prices aren't too bad considering it's in the Hard Rock Hotel. I've never been during Happy Hour but I really should one of these days.
