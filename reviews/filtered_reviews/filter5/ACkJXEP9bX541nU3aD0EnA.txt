We were looking for margaritas & were intrigued by this " de-sanctified" church! Yes your read correctly .. De-sanctified! I liked that they kept the stained glass windows and lots of the church's artifacts are on the wall.  And Where do you place the bar in an old church, the altar! You should go if just to see it alone. The food is great. The price even better with the daily taco 1.99 each along with the drink special it's a great meal at a shockingly reasonable price.
