Stopped by this place on a lark. Never heard of it before and never seen the reviews on Yelp. It was around 2pm on a Saturday so the place was not crowded. The food was really fresh and really good. 

We had guacamole, veggie burrito bowl, and chicken tacos. Everything appeared to be homemade and well seasoned. The service was fast and friendly. The mushrooms in the veggie bowl were fantastic. Not sure how they are prepared, but just a unique taste.

Menu is pretty straight forward and place is pretty small. I would definitely repeat.
