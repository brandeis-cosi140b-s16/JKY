This is my all time favorite taco shop! They have an excellent chicken spicy taco thing (chicken tinga) that is fantastic and always leaves me wanting to come back!!! Not to mention their chips and salsa are delicious! The atmosphere is so nice and all the employees are great, I love how they work in a team environment! Seriously, you have to come by and eat some tacos (or nachos) as soon as you can! And by the way.... You can't beat their prices!
