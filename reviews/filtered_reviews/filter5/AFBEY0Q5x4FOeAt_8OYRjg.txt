This place is wonderful, and is my go-to restaurant for Mexican food.

Where to start? Free chips and salsa, wonderful food, totally affordable (my FILs jaw dropped when he realized we paid less than $20 for our table), lovely welcoming atmosphere... the list goes on.

We have eaten here on many occasions, and they are always busy - because they are very good at what they do.
Shredded beef enchiladas with rice,beans and a drink for $6... unbeatable for lunch.
