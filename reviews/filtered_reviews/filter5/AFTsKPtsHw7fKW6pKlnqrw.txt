5 stars because the customer service and the food was great! The waitress was really good to us especially, because my son was being a brat, and she really went out of her way to help him with treats etc. The food was very different hence some of the names (fusion). We for the bulgogi fries which were an a recommendation from previous posts. Totally worth it!
