This was everything I've ever wanted in a restaurant. 

The flavors, the service, the price, the extras, the creativity, the portion. It was all there!

Our waitress was super helpful in choosing dishes. We got the fusion fries and fusion tacos. She told us which sauces paired well with which foods. 

The food was super hot and was a huge portion. Total for 2 was $14! What?! So good.

They have your free chips, salsa, guac, and a sliced orange. 

Def coming back next time I'm in Vegas.
