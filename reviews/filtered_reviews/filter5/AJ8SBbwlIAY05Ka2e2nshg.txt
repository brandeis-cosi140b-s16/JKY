The food is fantastic, the staff is helpful and the atmosphere is comfortable. 

The food at El Bravo just tastes better than the food at any other Mexican restaurant I have been to in Phoenix, regardless of price. The cheese is amazing! 

I love their flour tortilla flautas , crispy beef tacos, cheese crisps, enchiladas (I could go on and on). 

I really can see no reason to go anywhere else in Phoenix for Mexican food. 

I highly recommend El Bravo.
