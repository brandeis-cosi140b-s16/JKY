My organization hosted an event at Steel Cactus last night. Michelle is the event manager, and she was awesome! The staff was incredibly accommodating and friendly. My friends and I had dinner there before, and the food was also excellent. That sweet corn and roasted tomato salsa is DELICIOUS! Also, I do not like spicy food and the waitress was able to pick out something for me that I would enjoy. We had a wonderful time, and would definitely recommend this place to anyone hosting an event. Incredible service, friendly staff, and good food and drinks! Way to go, Steel Cactus! I will definitely be back!
