I've frequented many Mexican restaurants in Charlotte. I'd have to say that this place is one of the best. The atmosphere is always hustling and bustling. They're almost always busy. If you go at night, be prepared to wait in line. They will not seat you if your entire party has not all arrived!! I felt bad today because my friend and I got in before these two couples who were waiting on one more person to complete their group. But oh well, there's a sign up that details this rule, with "No Exceptions!" 

We were seated quickly. Our hostess had eyeliner that she drew to the corner of her eye and beyond. I thought it looked cool, like a character out of star trek or something. Within no time, they served up the free chips and salsa. The salsa was home made, and very good. The super hot salsa is extremely hot, and will make you sweat. I ended up ordering Camarones Diabla (I took a picture of it and placed it in the gallery here). I almost always order this dish when I go to the more authentic Mexican restaurants. The dish was very good, the sauce was perfect. Although I could've used a little more spice. They also put a lot of shrimp in it. One thing I will complain about though, is that I think they would've done better by deveining the shrimp. Also there were still a couple shrimp peels that hadn't been completely peeled off, so I did it myself. Regardless of those minor details, the dish was still superb. 

I've had their pulled pork soft tacos on previous visits. Those are also very good. Especially when you put that super hot salsa on it. Their tacos are definitely way better than Taco Bell. The service was great, my water was constantly being refilled, and the waitress kept calling me amigo, making me feel like she doesn't hate me and that I'm part of her extended family. I welcome that kind of affection. This is a great Mexican restaurant. I would definitely return, recommend, and bring amigos.
