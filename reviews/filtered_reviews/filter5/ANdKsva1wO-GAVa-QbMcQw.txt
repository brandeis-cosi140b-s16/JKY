This place is the real deal.  Great food, prices are competitive with other places nearby.  If you're not a fan of the ingredients in the burritos then just order it the way you want it, they'll hook it up.  I haven't had a bad meal there yet and I try to make it out to this place for lunch every Friday.  Coke in the glass bottle, soo good.  My favorite item is the Carnitas Platter.  It's on the higher end cost-wise but is definitely worth it.
