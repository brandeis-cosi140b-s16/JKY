The perfect place for a romantic date. El Encanto is the first place my girlfriend and I think of when we want to go on a date. It has become "our restaurant". The best part of the restaurant is the atmosphere. Wheather inside or out you have a perfect view of their beautiful pond full of ducks, swans, turtles, and fish. It has a beautiful mission like backdrop with gorgeous flowers and plants that make you feel like you are in beautiful athentic Mexico. The food is always great, it is authentic and always comes out perfect and delicious, and of course they have good chips and salsa which is how you judge a mexican restaurant anyway, making food quality above average. 
The staff is very friendly and very knowlegable about the menu, they can create the tast for you like it was already in your mouth. We love coming and spending time talking to our waitress because of how friendly she is, giving quality of service excellent.
The price is great as well. The portions are always big but this doesn't change the prices here, making value above average.
