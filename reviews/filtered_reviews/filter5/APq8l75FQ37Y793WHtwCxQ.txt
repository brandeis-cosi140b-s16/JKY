OK, so I'm now finally convinced that The Burrito Factory makes the BEST Burrito's in Charlotte! I had to give them the final and 5th star because you just cannot help but LOVE the passion and enthusiasm of the brother/sister team who own/run/manage/work this place. They are SO nice and you can tell that they LOVE what they do and that they LOVE their food. What's NOT to love about a big burrito with very fresh ingredients that YOU choose! They'll make anything you want and the way you want it. No skimping here!

Not the fanciest place, but you get one HELL of a deal always served with a super friendly face, with yummy food. Doesn't get much better than that! People are really starting to discover this place so you may expect waits at peak times. Highly recommended!
