Wow! What an experience. I walked in here and wasn't sure if it was a bar or restaurant. The two girls up front Rachel and Taylor were awesome. They sat us right away and put us by the tv we wanted to be by for the game. Our server was Super busy and Rachel brought us water and got our drink order so we were settled . Food was great and drinks were as well. I will definitely come back. When we walked out Taylor ran out our Togo box! She some how even caught that.
