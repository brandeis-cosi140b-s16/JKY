Great little Mexican restaurant in a strip mall. Limited menu with tacos, tortas and enchiladas. No alcohol but some soda if you want. Just four tables. They are busy with takeout. My wife and I dropped in and had a quick dinner. The enchiladas des mole poblano was excellent. My wife enjoyed the marinated pork sandwich. The taquitos came with chile verde guacamole sauce with just the right level of spice.
