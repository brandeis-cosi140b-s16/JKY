The food and the service at El Sombrero Rock!  Mom and I had the watermelon sangria (yum) and we  shared the two crispy beef tacos with two chicken enchiladas and the Chile Relleno with chicken. The crispy beef tacos were super tasty and the Relleno with chicken, butternut squash and all the other accompaniments was and way better than expected. I'm Not a huge fan of tomatillo, so the chicken enchiladas were not as mind blowing as the other food but they were still good. The beans were as good as grandmas but the rice was standard. I come from a Latin family and we cook lots of Mexican food, some of which I think we do better than many restaurants. I'm used to a different style of Mexican food, for "Mexico City" style food this was one of the best I've had.  We'll be back.
