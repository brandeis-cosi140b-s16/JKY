For my 500th review it had to be good and friends helped me find a great Mexican place that fit the bill.  The chips are hot and the salsa is fresh.   Corn tortillas are the norm!  Chicken tacos are meaty.  The bulls eye for me was the ground beef tacos - lots of flavor!  Simple, no-frills, good food.

Plus we had the drink of the day, a cucumber margarita.  I've never tasted anything like it and can't wait to come back.  And to top it all off, the price is right!  Just one more reason to drive through Central Ave more often.
