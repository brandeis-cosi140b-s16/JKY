Salt & Lime has fabulous tacos & guacamole! Their beef barbecoa taco comes with a choice of corn tortilla or flour. I recommend corn as I have tried it with both. It is chili braised short ribs that melt in your mouth topped with Oaxaca cheese and pico de gallo. This was a huge hit! Their chips and salsa that come to the table complimentary are also always warm, crispy and fresh. I have enjoyed myself the three times I have visited Salt & Lime and plan to come back this summer! I also enjoyed them sending out coupons to the nearby neighborhoods which allowed me to try them for the first time! Good thinking, S & L!
