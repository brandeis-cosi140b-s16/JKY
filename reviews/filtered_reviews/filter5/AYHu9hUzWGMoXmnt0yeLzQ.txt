Your basic "tex-mex" restaurant at a great price. For five bucks I got two tempura shrimp tacos (decently sized), and a chalice of dos equis.

Service was friendly and fast. The employees seemed like they were having "responsible fun" with their positions. Enjoying their jobs while making sure they took care of their responsibilities. 

If you go make sure you get one of their "Frequent Muncher" cards to get yourself a free shirt after 10 visits.

Overall... I have 5 punchs on my card, and I can tell you out of the 5 times I've been there, only once I was disappointed, and it was only because it was so busy.
