Always has great beer. Wings are my favorite thing to order by far.  Oakland and shadyside locations are my favorite. Shadyside has a big square bar and open garage door windows when it's nice. Oakland is dark and small in a good way. It's best to go here in the afternoon or early evening because it can get crazy and packed with people.
