Lets begin with cleanliness, the restaurant floors and bathrooms were immaculate. Upon arriving for a late dinner on Saturday night, the place appeared empty.  We had a large party and were seated promptly with a minimum wait. The regular salsa is delicious but the spicy salsa is best. However, todays spicy salsa was a bit heavy on the garlic.  After mixing the regular salsa and the chunky salsa in a bowl I was able to get the perfect salsa .  This restaurant is New Mexico flavor style place with plenty of dishes to satisfy your pallet.  I chose the Rio Grande Enchilada plate with adobada meat which is essentially seasoned spicy shredded pork.  They come with refried beans and rice. The enchiladas are topped with a cheese sauce that is to die for... 5 stars.
The dos x amber beer was spectacular and taste better in the company of good friends and family.  

The only negative in the evening, was that the restaurant was under staffed and since it was late, we shared the only waitress working with the entire restaurant. This appeared to upset our waitress because they got a late rush of people and she was having a difficult time managing all the tables. But we still had an awesome family dinner experience and everyones food was great. This Arribas restaurant is probably the best of the Arribas restaurant chain. It is good for large or small groups. 
I would highly recommend this place and give it 5 stars. For a family of four with a couple of beers , $63 bucks not including the gratuity. Good value and an awesome meal.
