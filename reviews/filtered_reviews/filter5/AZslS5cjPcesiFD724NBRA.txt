Love this place! Not super close to my house but always worth the drive, or a fun place to stop by if I'm headed to the Ranch Market. You have to be looking for it because it's in a tiny strip mall and could be easily passed up. I love the decorations inside it's Dia de los Muertos themed and all the art work is super cool. They have a salsa bar with tons of different salsas you can try out which is fun and gives you a good variety of spice and flavors (try the strawberry one!). All of the tacos I've had have been delicious but if you do get the plate with 2 tacos and rice and beans you're going to be really full or have half of your plate to take home. I haven't been for the happy hour tacos or whatever it is so I will have to make it by 6 one day for the deal. Highly recommend this place.
