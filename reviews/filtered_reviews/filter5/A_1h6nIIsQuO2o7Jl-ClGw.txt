This place is awesome. Wife had the shrimp - I had the Cochinita. Both effing delicious and reasonably-priced. And after reading some reviews, I'm really excited to go back tomorrow and try their horchata. The chips were a little salty for my liking, but the salsas we tried (especially the watermelon) were great. Cool art on the walls.

Seriously - La Condesa is the real deal.
