Delicioso! It has been a while since my husband and I last visited. Since it was Cinco de Mayo yesterday, we thought we needed authentic Mexican cuisine. We were so happy we went back to La Casa de las Enchiladas!

They recently updated the place. They installed a bar right when you walk in. It looked like a good addition. They changed the menu since the last time too...it now reads in English for those of you who need the translation. 

The food was great in taste and in portion! Service was fast and friendly (in Spanish, but also there was staff who spoke English). They serve breakfast all day long and they open at 10am (my kind of breakfast time). 

If you haven't been here yet, go soon...and often!
