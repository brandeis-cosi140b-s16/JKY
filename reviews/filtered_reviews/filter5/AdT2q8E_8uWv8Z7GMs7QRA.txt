We stopped by on a Sunday to try the brunch menu because drinks are tolerated during this occasion.  I'm sure glad we did!  The live music is a very nice touch and the acoustic guitar fills the air.  The highlight of the brunch menu was the Crepa de Chorizo, it has been on my mind ever since.  Also, the bloody Mary was very tasty, so much so, my better half didn't even know it was made with tequila.  We will be back to try the dinner menu, hopefully sooner rather than later.
