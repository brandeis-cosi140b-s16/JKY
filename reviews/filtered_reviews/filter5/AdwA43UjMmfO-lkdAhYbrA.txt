Tacos El Gordo, where have you been my entire life?

I am practically beside myself with joy knowing that I can get tacos this good outside of LA. This is the real deal, with a Tijuana pedigree, and it's wholly unlike anything Americans have been trained to expect from a taqueria.

But the first time you see that adobada roasting on a spit topped with a large chunk of pineapple... You know this is different.

You walk up to the meat you want to order, which is a little odd and not entirely convenient but I suppose charming in its own way.

I had the adobada, served with a slice of pineapple, avocado crema and onions and cilantro, a perfect flavor profile; the carne asada is topped with chunky, fresh, bright green guacamole and pico de gallo, a less exotic but equally tempting presentation.

The asada is cooked right in front of you. The adobada is sliced to order. The tortillas are formed and cooked seconds before the meat is piled on. It couldn't get any fresher.

And along with your tacos, you get a big pile of grilled jalape√±os and ceballitos (roasted green onions), making this an even better value - I can't believe that all of is goodness is just $2 a taco. On the Strip no less.

This place is such win. I need to go back, like - now.
