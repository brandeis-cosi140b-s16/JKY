I've finally made it to Paco's Tacos & Tequila and it was worth it.  We came in with two friends from out of town pretty late and were seated quickly.  

So to make it easy on why 5 stars:
Food was tasty, plentiful and a good value: Of course, gotta go with the tacos, and I prefer the flour tortilla (soft tacos). I had the Pick 3 tacos: a traditional Paco's brisket taco, the chicken one, and flank steak taco. Each just a little different, so I wished there were other choices of salsa to pick from.  Comes with the traditional side of rice and three different style beans to pick from.

Of course the tequila: We only had the margaritas and they go great with any and all Mexican style food.

Prompt and friendly service from all staff: The waitress was knowledgeable, made some good recommendations, and the chips and salsa kept coming despite a request for more.

Sure, I'd come back every once in a while.  I can see the tacos getting old after numerous visits though.
