My first visit here. We came because of Yelp and were very pleased.  They were right on with service and the food was amazing! We tried a few single items -- chicken taco as a lettuce wrap, chicken flauta with fusion guacamole, beef slider, shrimp fried rice, shrimp taco with fusion tartar sauce. Everything was wonderful and the server was so patient and helpful and friendly!  Plus their prices are so competitive.  Our meal came to $26, and we had leftovers.
