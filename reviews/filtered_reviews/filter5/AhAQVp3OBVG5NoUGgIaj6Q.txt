Worth the walk :) And nothing slutty going on here.  Now my favorite Mexican restaurant.  Staying at the Blue Moon Resort, I was looking for a place to dine within walking distance.  The Mood at the Artesian looked too busy,  so I consulted with Yelp.  El Dorado Cantina came up as the next closet place.  So I got brave and walked over (25 minutes) to here.  When I arrived,  I was in front of Sapphire (The World's Largest Gentleman's Club). As a gay guy,  I was very hesitant to approach the building :) The entrance is separate of the gentleman's club.  The first booth I saw,  had a couple with their children.  Very professional and courteous staff.  Food is excellent,  and not greasy like many Mexican restaurants. A very personal touch was to see the chef out visiting the patrons.  Be sure to try the flan,  it will send you off in bliss.  So glad I came in.  Will be back,  next time I am LV.  Hope you enjoy also. headed back to my hotel,  will grab a taxi - there's plenty out front.  Not to mention that there is also plenty of parking,  if you are driving...
