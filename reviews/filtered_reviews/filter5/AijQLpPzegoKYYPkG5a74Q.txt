We came here while waiting for our hotel room to be cleaned, for a beer, chips and salsa but ended up getting the taco/enchilada plate. Wow, the best tasting Mexican food I've had in a long long time. Strught up authentic, full of favor and spices that taste incredible. Do not pass this place by without stopping in and eating. You will not be sorry and you will be back.....we're coming back tomorrow for brunch.
