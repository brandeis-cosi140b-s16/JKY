I was getting tired of all the chain restaurants that we were eating at and I asked around for a recommendation of Mexican food.  This place was the highlight of my week in Phoenix.  Great family owned business that delivers on authentic Mexican taste.   The shredded beef taco, the creamy chicken plate, and the flan was all off the hook.  The spot is off of Scottsdale blvd, but it is worth the drive where ever you are coming from.  Only if they served carnitas....
