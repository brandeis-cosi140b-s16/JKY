It is Independence week and I LOVE me some America's!

Five stars for the bean and cheese burrito.  The. Best. I've. Ever. Had.
They don't use lard and it's just so cheesy and delicious! 

Four stars for everything else I've tried- tacos, salsa, chips.  Somewhat limited menu, but I'll only be going back for the burritos!

Cute, cute place.  I love the artwork and I plan on buying a piece for Nico sometime soon.  The "Taco Tuesday" piece calls to me each time I'm at America's.

I wish them all the best as they prepare for their new Tempe location!
