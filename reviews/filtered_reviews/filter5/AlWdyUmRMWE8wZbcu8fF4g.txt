It was very confusing to come in for the first time. The staff was very helpful and friendly, considering how busy it was. They have separate lines based on the type of meat you're ordering. I really recommend anything from the adobada line! I got an adobada tacos and split a loaded adobada fry with a friend. The loaded fry was amazing! I recommend getting that. It's big but 2 people wouldn't have a problem finishing it.
