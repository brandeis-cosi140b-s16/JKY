Service was great, atmosphere was cool. The food was lighter than normal Mexican but still tasted authentic. I'm big on beans and rice and chips and salsa. This place was excellent with all 3. The food is also really well priced. I got a two taco plate - 1 veggie and 1 shrimp. Both were light and tasty. The portion sizes were not oversized which I actually appreciated. Will definitely come back.
