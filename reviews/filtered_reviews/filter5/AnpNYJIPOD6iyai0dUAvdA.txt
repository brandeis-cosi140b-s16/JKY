I have been absolutely satisfied with the food at America's Taco Shop. I spent a couple of nights during their first week sampling the menu... The carne is as good as it gets...The menu is simple and filling, and the staff was/is extremely friendly and warm. I for one cannot wait for the patio to pick up with an evening with chips/salsa (which is AWESOME), a couple of tacos, and a bucket of beers before a Suns/D-Backs game... I am sure when the patio is complete (if they are smart) there will be speakers, some heaters, and good music. I can't say enough about the food... The corn is exceptional and different than anything I have had before. The salsa is fresh and just right. The meat is full of flavors and delicious on all of the items I have had, which is most of them... I was not able to finish off the bean burrito, but it could have been that I was so full from the 2 tacos, carne burro, and quesadilla I had pounded prior to it...I got half way through and was stuffed and at that point nothing was going to taste good...Wait, not true...the flan is excellent and it is making my stomach grumble right now that I don't have a piece to wash down the not so tasty Panda experience I had for lunch out here today... I am rambling now, but I want to post it clear here that America's Taco Shop is easily one of my new favorites in the area and I strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal at a reasonable price with friendly staff and a quaint atmosphere... One more thing, parking can be tricky, but it no worse than the place across the street (That's A Wrap), for those in the neighborhood, you know what I mean...I hope they stay around for a long time because I am just getting my appetite wet with their food!!! And hurry up and get that liquor license!
