I'm a local and I have been to a lot of different Mexican restaurants and let me tell you none of them compare to El Dorado Cantina. The food is delicious and the service is great. I order some street tacos, 3  tostaditas de tinga, and a margarita. I have never felt so close to a home cooked meal made in Mexico. And im saving the best for last, their flan is a most have!. I enjoyed everything very much and definitely will be coming back.
