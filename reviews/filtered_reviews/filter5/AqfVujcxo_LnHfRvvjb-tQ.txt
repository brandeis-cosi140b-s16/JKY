Nice experience here.  Venue was great, food was good (not amazing).  Outside patio is nice.  Service was not the greatest, but I wasn't expecting red carpet treatment since we were just ordering tacos, etc.  I mostly came for the band that was playing that night so all the food related service was just a plus.
