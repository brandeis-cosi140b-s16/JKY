I came here one day for some fish tacos and then came back the next for some more. As an Englishman living in Arizona I can get quite deflated by the standard of fish here. Until, i ate at tortilla fish, nice and flakey white fish with a help yourself fresh salad bar. I was very impressed with the food and the friendly staff (goes a long way). I will definitely be coming back. Just when though? Is it normal to have fish tacos three days in a row?
