OK...we have eaten at the BP multiple times and love the food.  Very unusual.  The shrimp tamale is superb.  So good in fact that it is hard for me to order anything else.  Be sure to try the oysters Rockefeller as they are wonderful.  Great mound of Guac  served in an avocado shell for $4.00.  Nice little wine selections too.  Very reasonable and when the weather is nice, eating around the fountain is very relaxing.  Highly recommended.
