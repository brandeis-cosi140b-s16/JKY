So I was in Vegas a few months ago for a cheer competition and as well know we have all had to tighten the belt a little so going to Vegas in these times was not the best timing. So having a Steak dinner was not going to happen and room service was only ordered once :( 
But lucky for us we were meeting some friends at the dueling piano bar and had some time for some grub so we stopped over at Gonzales Y Gonzalez and man am I glad we did. They greeting us with a warm basket of chips and offered their margarita which sounded and tasted so good! As always I ordered the Carnitas tacos which I have always ordered from all mexican restaurants that are put to the test and they passed with flying colors. The tacos were a perfect size their beans and rice tasted authentic and the price was oh so right! I don't know about you but I get so excited when I get a cheap bill. I dont know how many times we have gotten a big bill that was so over priced and made me mad. You have to pay no matter what but sometimes it just sucks. We ate here twice during our trip and didnt even feel guilty about not going to try something new, it was like why "try" something else when we have a sure thing...I guess I wasn't into experimenting that weekend. I will definitely go back next time I am in town.
