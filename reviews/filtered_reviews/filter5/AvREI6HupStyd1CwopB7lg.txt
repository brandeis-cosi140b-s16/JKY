This is my go-to place for fish tacos now for a couple of reasons. One is that everything seems so fresh, and the other is that despite my initial impression that the tacos are small, I always leave here full and satisfied. Honestly, the thing I cannot get over is the condiment bar. It is kept chilled and offers all manner of extra taco fillings... fresh salsas, chopped cabbage, limes, peppers, and the squeeze bottles of creamy sauces. I cannot discern what makes the Ranch Dressing here taste a hundredfold better than any other. Is it real buttermilk? Is it whipped up fresh every day? Do they add extra garlic or spices? I can't place it but it is phenomenal.

The other striking thing about Tortilla Fish is that I can no longer eat fish tacos without french fries. Their fries are absolute heaven when you pair them with my own concoction of fry sauce: It's half ketchup and half creamy chipotle dressing. Like their Ranch, the Creamy Chipotle is second-to-none. And the fish taco options keep growing every time I visit. On my most recent pilgrimage, I tried the "full taco" (fish, shrimp, and a cheese-filled yellow hot pepper) and the "fish machaca taco" (steamed and shredded seasoned fish). Both were excellent.

I'll admit it. I'm addicted to these fish tacos and fries. And there is no rehab for me, simply more repeat trips to my favorite fish-taco craving destination.
