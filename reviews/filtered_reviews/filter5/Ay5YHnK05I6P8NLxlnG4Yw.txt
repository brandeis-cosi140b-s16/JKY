After moving to San Tan Valley, we have been looking for a good Mexican food restaurant. Morenos was the place. It took us a year and a half to try it after reading reviews that it was bland with no flavor before we braved it and tried it anyway. It definitely had flavor even though it wasn't spicy. We aren't huge fans of spicy, but we like it to have flavor, and this did. The salsa with the bean dip was great, and I got the cheese enchilada and taco combo with green sauce. The taco was fresh and crisp, and the enchilada was very full. I wasn't able to finish all of it, and also got a tamale to go. We are thrilled that we finally took the chance and found a new favorite Mexican food place.
