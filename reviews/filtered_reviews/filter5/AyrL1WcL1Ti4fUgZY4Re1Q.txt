I cannot say enough good things about this place.  The food, the service are top notch.

The food is tremendous.  Everything from their killer homemade salsa and guac to the rellenos, pecan wood grilled shrimp and stacked enchiladas (the adovada is divine) is delicious.  Hard to go wrong.  The margaritas rock.  And believe it or not, their creme brulee is the best I've had outside of France.

I do not say this lightly.  I was in the restaurant business myself for many years, and love to eat out.  Blue Adobe is my favorite restaurant in this country.  It's a good thing I have relatives in Phoenix (I live in CA), as I would have to make up an excuse to travel here just to come to this restaurant.  In fact, the last time I was in, I overheard another patron say that he has been to over 100 countries, and this is his favorite restaurant of all.

Don't pay attention to the one-star "group of 30" people.  Anyone who calls day-of to inform of (not request) a mass influx deserves what they get.  That kind of event needs much greater lead time, and it just goes to show how thoughtless and self-important some restaurant goers can be.  Get a clue, people.  Diana bends over backward every time my family comes to visit.  I've only ever had friendly, hard working service each time there, perhaps because we are unassuming, non-demanding, realistic people.

Love you, Blue Adobe!  Wish I had you closer to me!
