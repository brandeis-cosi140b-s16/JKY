Definitely the culinary highlight of our weekend in Vegas.  You can get a three course menu that lets you get a great sampling of what they have to offer.  The foods were both familiar and unique--a sweet corn tamale, chilaquiles with duck confit, plantain empanadas--just enough of a twist to make it stand out without trying too hard.  Everything ran to the spicy side, which was more than fine with me, but be warned if you don't like a little heat.  I balanced it with a cranberry margarita.  For dessert, the pastel Rufalina was an excellent choice, but probably large and rich enough for two or three people.

While the food was great, what really stood out was the customer service.  We received excellent service from start to finish--especially from our server, Jeff.  He knew the menu backward and forward, and made great suggestions without being pushy.  We also got terrific service from the bartender and the hostess.  

After a ruined anniversary the night before at Craftsteak, this experience more than made up for it.  I'll be making this a must stop whenever I'm in Vegas.
