Everybody likes Dos.  I've found its the first place anyone from out of town is taken because its the prefect entry level Scottsdale bar.  While you'll find some really good looking people really dressed up, for the most part, this is one of Old Town's more laid back nighttime hangouts.  Imported friends arent scared off by pretentious club-goers, instead they are welcomed with obnoxious open arms and peanut shells on the floor.  

Drinks are cheap (Coronas are always just $2, mixed drinks are $6 and up) and the food is tolerable when you're a bit buzzed up.  Bar Mexican food is always a nice finale to 12 or so margaritas, thats what I always say.

Dos is known as a "great place to day drink" and it is that too.  Grab a stool on the patio and youre sure to make friends with someone, the gringos here are all pretty friendly.  

The "dance floor" (search your way through the crowd to the upstairs back balcony to find it...its small) is always packed at night, and the music aims to please.  

Day or night, local or foreign, everyone seems to have a good time at Dos Gringos.
