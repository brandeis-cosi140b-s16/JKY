The consome de pollo AKA chicken with rice soup is outstanding. We wish the one in PV was still open. The service is amazing! The restaurant is super clean. The beans are superb! I love the carne asada, green chili chicken enchiladas and the orange rice! Everything about the restaurant is great! Come try La Parrilla Suiza!
