Epic. One of the best meals I have ever had in Vegas. Period. Lunch time, Monday. Get greeted and seated right away by a super friendly waiter (part of the family who owns it). Order: apps: Aguachiles, oysters preparado. Entree: I get the mariscos molcajete and wife gets the fried catfish with pico de gallo. HOLY CRAP!! Everything was off the hook. Bold, in your face flavors, incredibly fresh and authentic. The Aguachiles, ceviche style shrimp in a spicy lime chile sauce, was mouth watering and perfectly spicy at a 5 out of 10. The oysters were topped with a generous pile of ceviche mixto with a great hot sauce and even under all that you could still taste the creamy, briny oyster. My molcajete was huge and the sauce is so balanced and deep in flavor. The catfish was PERFECTLY fried and was juicy and tender. Washed it all down with a free horchata for checking in. 

This is serious Mexican seafood, and could command a much greater price, but it's location and family oriented style makes it affordable and outstanding. Truly a gem on the Vegas casual dining scene. GO NOW!!
