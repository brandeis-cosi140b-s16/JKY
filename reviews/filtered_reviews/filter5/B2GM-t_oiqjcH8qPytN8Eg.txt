Ate dinner here on a Saturday night.  Their customer service was fantastic.  Had the nachos as a starter and they were pretty good as far as nachos go.  Dinner was DELICIOUS!!.  I had a burrito with roasted carnitas and green chile sauce on top.  My aunt had enchiladas with green chile sauce on top.  Both came with rice and beans (I had pinto).

I would like to go here again and bring my husband.  They have a fun food challenge.  If you can finish their yard margarita and giant burrito, you get a t-shirt.  Even if you can't finish it, the meal is a great deal.  Not sure if they would let you order and split, forfeiting the challenge, but would be worth a try.
