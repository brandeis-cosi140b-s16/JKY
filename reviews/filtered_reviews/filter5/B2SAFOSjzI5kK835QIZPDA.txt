La Santisima is easily one of the best taco shops in the Phoenix area. The menu is fresh and interesting,  with dishes taken from various areas in southern Mexico. If you want to try new and authentic flavors, this is the place. 

It's simple and unique, with a minimal staff and barebones table settings, but you somehow feel a sense of "rightness". It's no frills, no fluff, just great Mexican food for a price you can't match. I'd rather pay 9 bucks for an amazing burrito and eat my salsa out of a plastic bowl than visit a snazzy upscale place with food that's no better but have to shell out twice the price. 

Go. To. La. Santisima.
