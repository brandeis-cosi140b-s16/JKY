Excellent choice! Being from out of town it was our first time here and we were going based off reviews.   We ended up driving by another Z Tejas to get to this one because of the reviews and boy are we glad we did!  We were greeted by Amedeo and was instantly  treated with A+ service.  The excellent service didn't stop there.. Gavin also helped us and was just as great!  The food was good, but those Margaritas- mmmhmm! Max of 3 is understandable - strong but delicious!
