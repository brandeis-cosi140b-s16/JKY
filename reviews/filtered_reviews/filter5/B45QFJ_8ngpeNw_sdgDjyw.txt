4th visit and I am addicted! What a wonderful find so close to where I live. Very impressed especially as they've only opened June 1st (2 months ago).

The decor is comfortable, New Mexican appropriate while remaining upscale and avoiding that kitschy cheap look. Service is thoughtful, attentive and warm. The owners Paul & Amy are truly hospitable. Pricing is incredibly approachable and fair for the filling portions. 

And now the food...delicious! Warm Christmas chips to the table with a mild/medium house made salsa. Pork adovada is fall apart, rich and saucy. Guacamole is bright and green, their take as its not the traditional cilantro, salty laden mix. Posole is thicker and more stew like but nevertheless tasty. Tamales and enchiladas are decent but what makes everything standout is the sauces. The green sauce hasn't been blended so it's chunks of chile and the red sauce is smooth, developed spice without being burn the mouth hot, and quite frankly...addicting!  Sopapillas are airy, fresh and not greasy.  Best fried ice cream as the outside is still warm and extra crispy while the ice cream is *gasp* still cold! 

I'm not from nor have I been to New Mexico. But, I've been enjoying Mexican cuisine for about 20 years, consider myself a motivated foodie, and it's a different, refreshing spin that I highly recommend!
