This is hands down the best mexican food in Arizona, and since we were staying on property we decided to do some tequila tasting as well.  We just did app's for food.  The guacamole is truly the best we've had.  The taco trio is great, we prefer the carnitas over the other two so we always ask for 3 carnitas.  The steak quesadilla is small but super tasty.

We tried several Anejo tequilas, and surprising found a new favorite.  The Tres Amigos, which is actually George Clooneys tequila was fantastic!
