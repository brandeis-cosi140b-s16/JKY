My boyfriend doesn't like Mexican food yet he loved the place and now craves there salsa! 
Very good, cheap, and family run!

Great little bakery next door as well. 

My new favorite place in Vegas! Authentic. Near the base and lots of families were eating there when we were there
I love little hole in the walls, way better than those overpriced tourist traps near the strip! Def becoming a regular to this place :-)
