Since I only live 4 miles from KoMex, I love coming here regularly since my first visit around Sep 2011.  By "Checking-In" on my Yelp Android App, I also get a free wontons serving (4 pieces, normally $1 but tastes much more expensive than that) as part of my unbelievably cheap but delicious meal.

I've introduced my visiting Cali friends to this place and they've all loved it.  I usually order their "Special of the Week" listed on their dry-erase board next to the fridge.  I'm an atheist, but I pray to the higher powers that be that KoMex opens a branch in Spring Valley so all of their fusion food goodness is even closer to my house.
