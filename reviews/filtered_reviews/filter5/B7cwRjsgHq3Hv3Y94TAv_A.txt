I don't understand why this place has bad review! This is a wonderful place. The food is delicious and the price is not that bad. Matter in fact it's just right for the food quality. The dessert was just as delicious my server was amazing best than most I see in any other restaurant. The cocktails were a pleasure. I loved this place so much I couldn't stop eating! I kept getting more food and trying to eat more. In all my experience was wonderful and I can't wait to bring more family and friends to try this place out.
