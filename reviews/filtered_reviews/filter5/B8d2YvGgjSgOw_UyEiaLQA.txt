We had a delightful dinner here last night. The food was outstanding and very unique. It was fresh and not completely covered in cheese like so much Mexican food out there. In other words - a bit on the healthier side! Their signature margaritas are fantastic and happily not too sweet and syrupy. 

You should definitely order the Quesadillas which aren't like any quesadillas you've ever had! Yum yum yum - we can't wait to go back and have those again. We also had tacos (pork belly and lobster varieties) and they were also outstanding - some good spices and flavors and unique taste combinations.

The best part? Our server, Xavier. He led us through the menu, helped us select a great dinner,  was perfectly attentive and overall was the highlight of our meal through his excellent service. We'll be back and we'll be asking for him.
