A friend recommended this place and I'm glad they did! We went in today and were greeted by the owner who was so nice and upbeat. 

I ordered fish taco plate which came with beans and rice. A lot of places I go to their beans and rice just don't do it for me, but phranks beans and rice were really good. He also gave us all the salsas to try since he knew it was our first time, hot,medium,mild. When you tell me something is hot it should have kick to it and yes it did!  The fish tacos were great. Great batter,nice crunch, delicious sauce, and just right amount of green cabbage and cilantro to compliment the fish.
