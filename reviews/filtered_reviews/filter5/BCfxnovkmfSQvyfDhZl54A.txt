The Border Grill is becoming one of my favorite places to have brunch in Las Vegas. They ask you about your food allergies prior to ordering. I have a lot of friends with food allergies, and I have two myself. That is something that I wish all restaurants asked!

Both times I have been for brunch, I've left full for the rest of the day. You must order the $34.99 unlimited small plates. Share with your friends, try new things. The menu does change up. There are some staples I've seen both times: the breakfast fries, the churro tots....

Bottomless mimosas in multiple flavors are $10. Cannot bet that on the strip. Plus, you can take your mimosas to go. Once you've paid...get one more round and go shopping. 

The atmosphere is fun. The waiters are a lot of fun. Will keep coming back.
