Dined here tonight before Lionel Richie concert, hadn't been in a while and was looking forward to it. I loved the special menu created by the chef who worked with Bobby Flay. I had the ahi tuna , eggplant , and chips with guacamole. Filling, great to share with two people, and just fantastic.. I have yet to be disappointed by anything at this place. Even the non alcoholic drinks were just right & refreshing. Fresh limeade and sparkling pomegrante juice D: The service always exceeds expectations, our server knew exactly what to suggest and knew his menu thoroughly.. It's always nice when a server can make suggestions based on what you tell them you like. He also mentioned the vip club for 15% off our bill. Food was brought out promptly and presented well.. I really enjoyed the wasabi mashed potatoes with my ahi, and everything else that just complimented my dish well.
