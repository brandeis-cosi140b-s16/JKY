Originally, I was hesitant about going to eat here but I was so wrong. This place is amazing.  The staff was extremely friendly and the food was delicious.  They start you off with Chips, Salsa, and Bean Dip.  All three are very good.  Most of the menu items are around 20 bucks except for the Combinations page (gold mine).  The Combinations are delicious and huge. We had some deep fried ice cream, and it was the best deep fried ice cream I have eaten.  Their was a birthday in our party and they sang, gave us complementary churros, and a shot of tequila. 

Although this place was off the strip, I will definitely try to visit when I'm in town.
