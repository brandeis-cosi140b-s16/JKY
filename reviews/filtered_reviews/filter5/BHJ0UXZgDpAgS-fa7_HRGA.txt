According to my cousins in Tempe this place is a hidden gem.  They took me here even after having eaten there the night before, just because they liked it so much.  

I had the NY Carne Asada plate and it was delicious.  The meat was of pretty good grade for Carne Asada, with a very flavorful Chile-rub topped with mushroom cholula sauce on black beans and roasted corn avocado salsa.  I also had a taste of the Blue Corn Enchiladas which were also pretty tasty.

Having a sample of a few duifferent dishes we all decided that you probably can't go wrong with whatever you order.

I highly recommend this as place to come hang out, eat on the patio and have a great meal, some margaritas and maybe a few beers,
