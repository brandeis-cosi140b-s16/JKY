Great airport restaurant for a quick bite. Had the chips + salsa and the Mexican Chopped Salad with chicken. All very tasty! Every interaction I had with staff were friendly -from the host to the server and food runner. My server was very nice and helpful with recommendations. Plan to come here again the next time I'm in Terminal 4!
