So I have to confess that Margaritaville was disappointing. They had drinks in a plastic cup and no food available at midnight. My Brother and I agreed that this place Diablo was the place we should have gone to but lesson learned. We had a great lunch and drinks were worth it. If they keep up the great service and quality we will comeback for more.
