This was my first time here - my date suggested it after church. Holy Schnikees! The location has a waterfront view - both inside and on the outdoor patio. Beautiful for these parts! The ambiance was well sculpted - each booth is given to privacy. The server we had, Bri, was fun, friendly and helpful! My date had a Vegetarian dish similar to a Fajita. She thought it was excellent! I had the pork Fundido and brother, let tell you, WOWSER!!! A little bit of deep-fried jalape√±o cream cheese heaven was sent my way!

For the food, for the view, for the fun and the helpful service - 5 stars!!! Solid!
