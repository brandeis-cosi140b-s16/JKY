We visited Phat Phrank's today for lunch and I cannot wait to come back.
We ordered the adobada torta and adobada tacos.
The adobada pork is so tender and full of flavor.
It is braised and then put on the flat top until it is nice and crispy.
The torta sandwhiches comes with lettuce, Pico de Gallo and this amazing crema sauce with your choice of salsa.
Phrank's has been in the area since 2009 and it is deliciously good food.
Everything is made from scratch.
We tried the chimi-cheesecake for dessert. It is a flour tortilla stuffed with a flavored cream cheese, rolled and deep fried. Then they roll it in cinnamon sugar and drizzle with caramel sauce.
I am so full and so happy.
Phrank is a great guy with a big heart amazing recipes.
Once you try Phat Phrank's you will be a repeat customer!!
