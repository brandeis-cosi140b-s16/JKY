We LOVE this place and couldn't be happier to have them on the west side!  Fresh, unique, incredibly delicious food in a comfortable atmosphere and contrary to other reviews, our service has always been exemplary!  Not at all the typical swimming-in-grease-and-cheese Mexican food but fresh and interesting and an extensive menu!  We are regulars and have hardly made a dent at trying everything they offer!  The salsa bar is like no other and stands on its own in making this a must-go destination!  Give this great restaurant a try....you won't be disappointed.  Then, tell all your friends and family so one of Glendale's best restaurants stays here!
