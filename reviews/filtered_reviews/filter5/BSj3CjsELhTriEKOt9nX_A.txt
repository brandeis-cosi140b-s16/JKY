Best TACOS in town. Hands down. There are a few taco trucks in phoenix I know of but too far for more on most days. This place takes the cake. 

This is a must try if you like street tacos and more of an authentic type of Mexican Food. Not Arizona Mexican...

EAT HERE BUT BEWARE - LUNCH IS LIKE A COOL SPOT IN LOS ANGELES, CA. LINE AROUND THE BLOCK! (maybe not around the block, but out the door. Don't worry it doesn't take that long and you can meet someone in line)
