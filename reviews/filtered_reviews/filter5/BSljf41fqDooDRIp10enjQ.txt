I've found a new addiction. Los Tacos step aside. They have mini tacos, elote, and agua frescas that put Frijoles above the rest. And let's talk about those Frijoles! They get at least 5 stars. The chips, tortillas, red and green salsas are definitely something to talk about. The kind of kick that sticks to your tongue and makes your nose run, but doesn't have you running to the counter asking for leche. Did I mention they have elote? It had the perfect combination of flavors with enough juicy goodness to appreciate the charred kernels. We generally opt for the courtesy cup of water, but we're persuaded to buy an Agua fresca after numerous samples of various concoctions were offered.
