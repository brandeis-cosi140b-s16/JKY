Like the quaint atmosphere really cute!  Out door seating that is nice during the cooler times of year.  I eat here often and everything is a hit!  If you just want some tacos theirs are an A plus...the meat juicy and tender in the chicken tacos and the chili relleno  is the best around.  The chips are so fresh...and the salsa is spicy but not too hot.  A nice place for a date ...have a margarita, enjoy a great dinner and then walk around the galleries...a night to remember!
