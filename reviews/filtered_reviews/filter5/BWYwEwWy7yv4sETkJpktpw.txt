Barrio Cafe takes Mexican food (as most Americans know it) to a whole new level. From the very beginning it's evident that Chef Silvana knows her stuff. The creativity of the menu and the superb execution of the recipes is just the beginning of a wonderful taste experience. 

The wait staff as well as the hostess were friendly, helpful and sincere in their appreciation of our business. 

Barrio is not close to where I live but I am certain I will go back... over and over and over again.
