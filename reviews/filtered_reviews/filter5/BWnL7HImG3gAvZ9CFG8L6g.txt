Oh man oh man, I'm a big fan of Cafe Rio.  No bigger fan.  Well, maybe, but I'm a pretty huge fan LOL.

I like the new location.  It's in a small detached building in a huge strip mall.  There's ample parking and lots of big windows.  The place is big and has a lot of seating.  I like the bright colors and the different shaped table tops.  The place is clean and flows very well for me.  Although it's getting colder, I do appreciate the outside seating option as well.  

I've been to that new location twice in one week because A.) it's closer to my apartment and B.) it's worth every cent.  Their pork barbacoa is just something else!  I always get the pork barbacoa salad for around  $8.  It's huge!  Start with a homemade tortilla, lined on the bottom of a tin container.  The tortilla is heated up on the flat top with melted cheese.  You then pick between two kinds of beans and rice.  Then comes the pork.  A nice heaping tongful of this magical meat.  Sounds weird but I have dreams about it.  After that, they load the container with lettuce (I prefer the shreaded lettuce because it means more lettuce and less unused space), cilantro, crispy tortilla strips and a scoop of guacamole.  For the dressing, I prefer the vinaigrette.  Let me just tell you.  I feel as if you don't need dressing.  The barbacoa part of the pork is sweet and just a little tangy.  The black beans and rice really compliment the entire dish and mixed with everything else, you've really got a fulfilling combination.  

I could literally go blue in the face, telling you how much I love it there, but you need to try it for yourself.  This place has got it going on!  I beg you all to get in your cars and visit Cafe Rio for the pork barbacoa.  You will NOT be disappointed :) oh and you're welcome in advance...
