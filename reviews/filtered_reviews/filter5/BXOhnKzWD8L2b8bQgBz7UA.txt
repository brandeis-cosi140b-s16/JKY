As far as Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas go, for me, Viva Mercado's reigns supreme.  We've been coming to Viva ever since they were at there former location on Flamingo.  I really loved the funkiness of the first location and initially felt that the new location on Rainbow was a little, I don't know, sterile in comparison. 

We hadn't been to Viva for a long while - and we had some celebrating to do!  We arrived pretty early for dinner on a Friday and were seated immediately.  Being the good Yelper that I am, I immediately checked in.  To my surprise Viva offers a 20% off your bill check-in offer!  Win!

Once we were seated we received a basket of their complimentary chips with salsa and bean dip.  I like the salsa, but LOVE the bean dip.  It's hard to leave room for the main course!  We ordered up our entrees and drinks - Tostadas Acapulco-style and a Sauzarita Margarita (Sauza Gold w/ Grand Marnier) on the rocks for me.  They serve one of my favorite fideo soups here, and it was as good as I remembered it. 

When the entrees arrived they were RIDICULOUSLY HUGE!  My tostadas were piled high with a ceviche-like mountain of chilled shrimp, langostino, and crab with pico de gallo, queso fresco and a dab of sour cream.  Refreshing citrus flavors and huge chunks of seafood.  So yummy - but I could only finish one.  We asked our terrific server (didn't get his name but he was great) for boxes - and they surprised us with complimentary freshly-made churros at the end of the meal.  I managed to polish off one of the churros, even though I was totally stuffed.

Love you Viva - I promise not to stay away too long next time!
