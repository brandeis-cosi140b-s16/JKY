I had a fantastic salad, with steak AND barbacoa. It included mixed greens, cucumbers, tortilla chips and yellow and orange bell peppers. For dressing, three different salsas were included; each more delicious than the last. The homemade guacamole was wonderful.

The food is delicious and the prices are reasonable. Service was fast and personal, as I was the only one in there. I think I was served by the owner. I wish I could give it a 4.5/5, with a slight markdown for the sparse decorum, which was on par with most places where you order at the counter.
