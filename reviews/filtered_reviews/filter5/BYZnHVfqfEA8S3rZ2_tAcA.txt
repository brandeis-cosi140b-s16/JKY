I came here last week and got the most amazing beef bulgogi chimichanga ever. It kind of reminded me if a Philly cheese steak. Additionally, we ordered kimchi fried rice. Our bill was about 20 dollars. While waiting for our food to cook, we were given complimentary chips, salsa, and guacamole. The chips were like fried wontons and I would definitely pay for more.

The only disclaimer I can leave is not about the restaurant itself. I had a lady come up to my parked car right as I was about to drive away. She of course asked for money. And there seems to be influx of beggars in the surrounding streets. Don't worry my friends, I bought her a chicken sandwich before leaving.
