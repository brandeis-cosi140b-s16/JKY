this place IS YOUR JACKPOT in Vegas therefore you must try it, no exceptions!!
Huge bonus is that it opens late and the price is inexpensive. The food quality is top notch-hard-to-find Mexican food. They cook the meat on the spot so you'll get to enjoy the most fresh delicious juicy taco. There really isn't any con about this place, but if I were to pick one thing, since it is SO popular... the line will test your patience. Seriously, this place gets never ending customers any time of the day! 
What are you doing reading this review?? Go try it now!! :)
