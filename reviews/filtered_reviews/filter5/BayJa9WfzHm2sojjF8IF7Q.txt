I've been to Blanco's a ton of times, but I keep forgetting to write down my review, so here it goes:

Fox Concept restaurants are, by far, my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. I'm a huge fan of Olive & Ivy (check out my review), and Blanco's Tacos & Tequila. We come here for lunch about once a month in a group of 6 or so. It's pretty conveniently located too for anyone in the Old Town area. 

Since I'm a regular here, i can speak on consistency. Their service is always great. I've read multiple reviews complaining about the service and I've never experienced it, and I've been here for lunch and dinner. The food is also always good, never disappoints.

Food: I always get tacos. I've tried 4 different types: fish, chicken, carnitas, and carne asada. My fave is always the carne asada, but the rest are great. The beans are boring, but that's pretty much anywhere you go. Let's talk about that rice: What the heck do they put in that rice?! Cheese? cream? I don't know, but it's an ongoing mystery with my fellow Blanco's guests. I can't describe how delish it really is, you just have to try it yourself. 

The only thing my husband doesn't like is the serving size. Personally, I think it's perfect, but he's a big man, so he needs a lot of food. Just watch out for appetizers, that's where my bill tends to add up quickly. 

Kids meals are good and not much different than most other mexican establishments.
