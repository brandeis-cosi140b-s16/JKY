We liked it! The pork shoulder was smokey and delicious. Surprised to see such negative reviews. Give it a try. Our bill was $ 40 for two full meals and one house margarita. Seems fair to me. The margarita was top notch! And I know margaritas, lol! Portion sizes were good! I recommend checking it out if you love Mexican food!
