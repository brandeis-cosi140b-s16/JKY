Love the food, love the drink varieties, our bartender was awesome! This place is packed!!! Make a reservation in advance if you can. If not, prepare to stalk other patrons' bar seats! Well worth the wait though. The Korean Tacos I had were fantastic with the right amount of spiciness, not to mention HUGE. Highly recommend the Spicy Passionfruit and El Diablo as drink options if you like some heat with your alcohol. One of the best parts of my stay in Pittsburgh.
