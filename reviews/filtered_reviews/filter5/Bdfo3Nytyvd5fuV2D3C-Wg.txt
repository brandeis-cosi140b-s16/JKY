Wow, love that a place like this moved in down the street. 
Inexpensive, fresh, delicious - everything I want in a mexican restaurant.
My soft shell carne asada taco was fantastic -- freshly prepared and topped with guacamole, which by the way is super creamy. Basket of chips are free, as is the toppings bar -- every one of the 6 or sauces were delicious. 
I plan on frequenting Salsa Blanca ; )
