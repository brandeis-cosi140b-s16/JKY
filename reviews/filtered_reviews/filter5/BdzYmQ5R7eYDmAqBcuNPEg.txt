They have a grilled corn on the cobb appetizer that is amazing! For that matter, the entire meal was great. They also have a unique selection of Margaritas which are REALLY good but a little pricey at $12.00. 

Located on the second floor near the front entrance to the Luxor, the restaurant has a nice, modern, upscale vibe. The restaurant is open air to the pyramid so you have a great view to do people watching from the dining tables or the bar. 

5 stars all the way, this is a great place to go to if you are looking for a quality Mexican Restaurant that is semi-casual.
