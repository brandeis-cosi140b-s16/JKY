Sat down quickly receive service very fast I ordered the chile relleno with a chicken enchilada chips salsa and guacamole the food was very flavorful hot out of the kitchen our drinks were never empty our meals were well presented on the plate not only did it taste wonderful but it looks wonderful my husband ordered the tacos they were awesome as well the price is very reasonable and the atmosphere is awesome definitely a five star for me... First time I actually had rice at a Mexican restaurant that tasted awesome highly recommend
