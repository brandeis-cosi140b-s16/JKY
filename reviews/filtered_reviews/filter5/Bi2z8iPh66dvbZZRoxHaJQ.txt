Believe the hype!  The comida at Don Panchos is the best in the west (side of town). Temper your expectations, though.  This is not fine dining, just real deal home-style Mexican food.

The tacos are the star attraction here, in my opinion. Street style, with loads of meat, cabbage, cilantro, & onion.  They are an absolute bargain for the quality you get.  The quesadilla de maiz are the bomb.  Burritos are mighty tasty, though could be a bit bigger.  If you order the delicious green chile plate, be prepared for some of the best home made corn tortillas you'll ever have.  

The meats here are all fabulous, but the carne asada deserves special mention.  It's very lean, perfectly seasoned, and is cooked over an open flame to impart a kiss of smokiness.  Easily my favorite carne asada of all time.  In taco form?  Wow...just wow.

Not to be over-shadowed, they have an excellent salsa bar.  The red chile is spicy with a nice saltiness. The green chile is smoky and has a nice kick.  But here is the pro tip: their best salsa is kept in the kitchen and is served with the complimentary chips. This stuff is amazing with a hint of cilantro.

The atmosphere is clean and the service is always friendly.  The first few times we ate here was take out.  The first time we ate in the restaurant, Jose (the proprietor) was so nice & gave us free arroz con leche!

If you're in the west valley and crave some seriously good carne asada tacos, you can't do better than Don Panchos!
