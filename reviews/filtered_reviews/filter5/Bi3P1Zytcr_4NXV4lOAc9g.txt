Super cool Mexican restaurant in a great part of downtown.  The amazing guacamole was a surprise - I plan on copying their recipe with pomegranate seeds!  All of our entrees were delicious, and the waiter was very friendly and attentive.  Afterwards we walked around the cute downtown area and window shopped-it was a perfect evening.
