Came here last year and they were located in a weird spot on the strip now they are a little drive away but they have a restaurant where you can sit down and is organized. We ordered 12 tacos of different variety and loved every one. Salsa could be improved but can't complain because the meat is on point and stuffed in tortilla. My one complaint standing in multiple lines to order different kinds of tacos.
