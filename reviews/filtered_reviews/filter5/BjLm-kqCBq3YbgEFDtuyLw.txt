Nom, nom, nom - can't talk - eating.  I'll sum it up: fantastic little taco joint, FRESH food & salsas, clean establishment. Got the Agua de Jamaica & Papa Loco spiced up at the salsa bar; it was so delicious that I hurt myself! Seriously, I ate so much that I actually hurt myself. Somebody help me - I can't wait to go back and do it again!
