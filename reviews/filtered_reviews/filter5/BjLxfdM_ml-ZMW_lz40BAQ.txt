Definitely some of the absolute BEST Mexican I've ever had. The fish tacos were super flavorful and perfectly crispy, the asada street style tacos were awesome, the rolled tacos were amazing and piled high with black beans, cheese and sour cream, and the chicken quesadilla was tastier than any other I've had. The staff was friendly, the food was amazing and affordable, and the guy running the place was super cool. My only gripe is that I live in Chandler, and now I'm going to have to drive 30 mins to eat here, which I'm going to do, because it's that good.
