Amazing! the hotel and Yelp rated this high and I am sure glad we went to try it.  I was a little skeptical at first because the waiter talks like Stevie Nicks sings.  He gave me the Happy Hour options twice, but I couldn't quite catch them so I ordered the house margarita ($4).  The salsa was spicy, fire roasted. Not my cup of tea, but my husband vouched for it as true New Mexico fare.  Not to worry, had the rubbed ribs (the waiter had trouble understanding ME when I ordered) and they were stunningly good.  The half rack was piled high, the cornbread sweet and spicy and the wedge salad amazing.  Can't remember when all the things on my plate were that good.  Although the waiter seemed diffident and unfriendly, I have to admit the service was very good.  My husband had the chile relleno (sp?)  with shrimp and cheese, both sauces and they were to die for.  I'd go back tomorrow, and the next day, and the next.
