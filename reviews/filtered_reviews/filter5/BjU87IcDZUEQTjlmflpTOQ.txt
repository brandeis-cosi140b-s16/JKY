My waistline doesn't want to admit it, but I am a regular here, coming in about once every week to two weeks. I love the Colorado red chili, the green chili pork, the carne asada, their hot salsa, Cali burrito....really, the list goes on and on. The burritos are huge and really reasonably-priced. Everyone that works here is super friendly and most days when I pick up my order, someone is sitting there chopping away at delicious fresh onions, tomatoes, peppers for the various dishes. They have a very extensive menu and I really need to try some of the tacos and other items but the burritos are just so darn good! Their patio is covered and not very large but we usually just order ours for pick up and eat at home. I have never been there when there wasn't some form of line but the wait isn't all that long for the food. 

They have free wi-fi, amazing, quality ingredients, they don't skimp on the meat and fillings in the burritos, either. I will definitely keep coming here.
