Really really really good. As a first-timer I found the set up a little overwhelming/confusing, but then I put an asada taco in my mouth and everything was right in the world. So much flavor. The avocado sauce is serious. The grilled peppers on the side are necessary. Spicy pork was super tasty. 

I wish they had chips. I may not look like a gringa but I do eat like one...
