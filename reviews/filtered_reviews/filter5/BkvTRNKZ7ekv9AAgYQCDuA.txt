I'm soo glad we tried this place. At first i was like" korean-mexican food sounds gross" but my curiosity got the best of me.   And i don't regret it now. We loved it.  They definitely have our business til forever,  we are sooo going back. We tried the fusion beef tacos and the chicken broccoli.   The food was so good and the price is just right.  
I totally recommend this place to everyone, especially if you r looking for a new place to go eat.
