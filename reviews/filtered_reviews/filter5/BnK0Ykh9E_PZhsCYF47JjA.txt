As a disclaimer, I was here for an event so I'm not sure how it is on a regular night, but wow did I ever have fun! We were greeted by friendly staff and directed to the tequila tasting, then to the bar for our complimentary beverage. The drink was delicious, with well balanced flavours and a boozy kick that didn't overpower the taste completely. There was a dried chili in my drink that I was exceptionally tempted to eat, but I think I would likely have no tongue left had I done that!

I was introduced to some lovely people at the event, and spent some time chatting and enjoying the atmosphere; The Mission has a very carefully balanced feel that straddles the line between hip and old world in a charming and successful way. 

There were some unreasonably delicious snacks served too - crunchy tortilla chips with a salsa that tasted like it had been roasted and sprinkled with fairy dust, and the best guacamole of my life. No joke. Locals likely have a lot more experience than I do, but as a Brit who moved to Vancouver I haven't experienced a lot that have blown my socks off. Now, I wasn't wearing socks the night I went to The Mission, but when I got home all of my socks were in disarray; I think you get the picture! The guac was rich, creamy, and incredibly fresh tasting with a plethora of yummy tastes that all danced together in a happy boogie. Go try it immediately! 

I had a look at the full menu after the event as I was hungry for more Latin food, but I found most of the prices to be quite expensive. I'll be back for sure, but it will definitely be a special treat!
