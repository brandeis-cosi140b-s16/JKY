I don't get it. There shouldn't be a great chain taco place in a well-touristed location such as the Strip, but here it is.

Tacos El Gordo has been one of my bookmarks for a long time, yet somehow it wasn't until I was literally half a mile away that I decided it was worth the trip. I'm really glad I made that oh-so dreadful drive...

Even though I've been to similar places, it took me a while to order. I wasn't sure why everybody was piled up on one side of the ordering area. And then there was the empty ordering station on the right edge, which threw me off further. Eventually, I did find my way to the open al pastor station and the open assorted cuts station, and I got my tacos.

After paying (cash only, $2+tax per taco), snapping photos, and finding a seat (outside the off-peak yet still packed restaurant in this awesome tent with two heavy-duty fans and real tables), I dug in and enjoyed delicious bite after delicious bite. And yes, I can review meat by meat because I asked the guy in the kitchen to point out which was which. And I may have eaten some of these before.

- Sesos: braaaaains. You, too, can be a zombie! This is pretty creamy. Makes sense, because it's cow brains. (Not sure I can compare the flavor to anything, just try if it you haven't and aren't squeamish. And no, i don't have mad cow disease yet.)
- Cabeza: tender head meat. From a cow. You can taste salt but it's not salty. Came with a green salsa, same one as on the cesos taco, and diced onions and cilantro, same mix as they provide on all tacos.
- Al pastor (adobada): I've had the unfortunate experience of overcooked, dry, salty pork at other places. Not here. I actually saw the meat bubbling on the vertical spit, and it tasted delicious. They actually have a medium spiciness red salsa under the almost neon green, sweet sauce.

(Funny story with that al pastor. There weren't pineapples, so I asked if it came with them. Al pastor guy goes to the fridge and unwraps the foil from a large piece of pineapple, then sticks the pineapple on top of the vertical spit, and carves off a nice hunk from it. Just throws it on the taco, which I didn't mind since I can portion control with my incisors. A minute later, as I'm ordering at the adjacent station, the pineapple somehow comes flying into the boiling tray of meats and splashes liquid all over the sneeze guard. Dude didn't know where it went and looked around for a while until he finally saw it. Boiling tray station employee grabbed it for him and returned it.

Anyway, back to the rundown.)

- Tripas: pretty salty, not as intestinal as you might expect, crunchy from being fried, comes with that red salsa from above. I'd get it again, probably.
- Suadero: beef shoulder. Best purely savory thing that I tried here. It's beef, and you can feel the meat fibers, but it's still quite tender.
- Buche: chewy, visible stomach lining. Little salty and perhaps acidic, which isn't that surprising since it's, well, a pig stomach. Don't confuse it with pork belly, because that's something else entirely.

Huge credit to Tacos El Gordo for offering a quality, cheap product, especially on the Strip. I'd definitely come back here or check out their other Las Vegas location the next time that I'm thinkin' tacos (probably for cabeza, al pastor, suadero, and the lengua that I skipped out on). I'd also try the San Diego locations too if somehow I managed to check out all the other popular spots first.
