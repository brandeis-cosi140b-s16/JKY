The food is delicious... I specially love their tamales, they taste like some one picked up the corn that morning!!! True, the place is ALWAYS busy but that is understandable since they have good food, good service and nice atmosphere. Plus, even thought is always busy, we never had to wait more than 5 minutes before we get a table. Last time my boyfriend and I were there, we were sitting right next to a table with 15 people. We thought "great, now our waiter is going to be to busy and we'll get bad service"... but no, that didn't happen... we got great service. Also, even though it gets pretty busy, we never felt is too loud or crowded. We are always comfortable and can have a conversation without having to yell across the table. 
Plus, they also have tons of outdoor seating.  Anyway, We love this place so much that we drive 30 minutes just to eat there... and 30 minutes is a long drive for those of us who like to hang out within the Tempe city limits!!!!!
