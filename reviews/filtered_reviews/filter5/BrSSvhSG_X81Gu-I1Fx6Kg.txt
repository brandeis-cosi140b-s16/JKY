Service was friendly and efficient. The green salsa is fresh and spicy. The enchiladas were moist and delicious. The blue corn enchiladas were served with a friend egg, which was a nice accompaniment to the entr√©e. We ordered the Guacamole, which was fresh and filled with chunks of avocado and onion.
