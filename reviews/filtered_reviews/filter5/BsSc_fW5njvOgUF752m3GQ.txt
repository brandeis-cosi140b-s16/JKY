I moved to Charlotte roughly a week after the Bakersfield opened in Cincinnati. I made sure to visit and was not disappointed when I checked out their new location in Dilworth. The past few restaurants in their location didn't do so well, but there is always a great crowd when I'm there! The have local beer on tap and the tacos are amazing! I do wish the menu had a few more options but they're doing what they do have perfectly!
