This place is a diamond in the rough. I would have never thought to try it if it weren't for my buddy dragging me there for dollar margaritas. It is tucked in a corner behind a Circle K with a big sign that reads "MEXICAN FOOD". 

Oddly enough, living in Arizona it is hard to find really good Mexican food (who woulda thunk, but it's true). I have to say the food at this place is very good, some of the best Mexican food I have had in AZ. I have had the fish tacos (fresh and tasty) and a chimichanga (is that even traditional Mexican?) and it was delicious. The chips and salsa are very good, but the bean dip is out of this world. 

The atmosphere is perfect for a Mexican Restaurant. It's nothing you need to dress up for, but it's not run down by any means. It's a good place to go with the family or a special someone for a good meal or even with a group of friends for a good time with a little green liquid help with salty rims. 

Cheers
