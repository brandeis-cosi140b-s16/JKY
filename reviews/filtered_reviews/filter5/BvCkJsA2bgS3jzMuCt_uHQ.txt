The food was MUCH better than I expected. I was just happy they were open till 11:00 pm but the food was excellent.

I LOVED the rice! The hot salsa was in fact spicy which is a big +1 for me. 

I had the shredded beef tacos and they were also quite good. The peach lemonade was a nice touch as well.

Lenny (the owner) was there and he was extremely congenial and that is always a really cool experience.

I cannot wait to go back.
