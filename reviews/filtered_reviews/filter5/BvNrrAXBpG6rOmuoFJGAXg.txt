I love love love this place! It's a bit small and crowded at times, but is worth it! When the weather is nice, there are a couple tables outside that are perfect for enjoying the fall/winter/spring mornings with a nice cup of coffee. 

Moreno's has a large breakfast menu that my husband and I take advantage of. They have a variety of Mexican dishes (Huevos Mexicanos or Machaca Plate) and standard American meals (french toast or eggs with hashbrowns and bacon). So no matter what you're feeling like, you'll get what you want!

Gerardo, the shift manager and server is very personable and seems to always be there! He always remembers what we like to drink and eat, not to mention the best server we've had in San Tan Valley.  I will say we have had bad service on occasion, usually if Gerardo is on vacation, but is wont deter us from getting our morning Machaca Plate.
