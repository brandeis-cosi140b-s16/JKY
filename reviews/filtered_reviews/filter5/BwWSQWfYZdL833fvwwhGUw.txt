No matter what night I've been there they are always busy.  The wait isn't usually that long, the hostesses are always nice and polite. The wait staff is also nice, any one of them will help. The food is ALWAYS amazing.  Comes out nice and hot. The portions are huge, most of the time  I have to ask for a doggie bag.

I recommend this restaurant to everyone, my In-laws had been visiting and wanted a place to eat, we suggested Nando's and they loved it.
