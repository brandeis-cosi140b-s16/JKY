Maybe it is not fair to throw up five stars over two tacos, but as the saying goes, "All's fair in love and tacos." I had the al pastor (spicy pork) and buche (pig gut), and both were phenomenal. Taco Taco is a (brace yourself) taqueria. Sure, there are some other options (i.e. burritos, bowls), but tacos are at the crux of this business, and business is good. As per taqueria etiquette, you walk up to counter and order directly from the cooks. Feel free to try the various meats they offer (the cook I dealt with gave me a try of the al pastor unprompted) before making your decision. After grabbing your grub, Taco Taco has a large, clean, and no-frills dining area. My only knock is that there are not more tacos in the name. I would like to see them add a few and go with Taco Taco Taco Taco Taco in the future.
