As a Flight Attendant, I often struggle with finding fresh, quality food while on the road (especially delivery). For an order placed over the phone, this was above and beyond in the matter of service, quality, and quick delivery. When placing my order for the Dacha Salad, Stroganoff and Kiss Cake, Alex the owner had no issue with honoring the $5 Yelp discount for checking in. They were unfortunately out of the Kiss Cake, but Alex quickly suggested another dessert that was a best seller in it's place. I decided to forgo the sweets this time around but was pleased with his demeanor and willingness to please.

 The delivery was very fast and the salad arrived chilled, while the stroganoff was still warm. Both were incredibly fresh and prepared with care using top quality ingredients that were evidently seen (freshly chopped garlic and tarragon for the Stroganoff and fresh parsley in the Dacha Salad). The potatoes in the stroganoff were perfect. The cucumbers in the salad were still crisp. 

After greatly enjoying my meal, I even received a follow up phone call to ask me how my meal was! I'm greatly looking forward to my next trip back to Vegas again next week so that I can dine in and try the Kiss Cake and more off the menu!
