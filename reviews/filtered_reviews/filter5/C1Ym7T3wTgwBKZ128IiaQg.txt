Are you kidding me?!?  The best Mexican food outside of New Mexico, and in a Las Vegas suburb!  We were just blown away.  Great food - I had the mulitas and my wife had the enchilada de mole.  Both just outstanding, and way too much for us to eat.  (That's what take home boxes are for!)  Our server, Hernan, must have been telepathic - whatever we needed appeared before we could ask!  He must have tipped off the cook, too, because our food arrived before we could finish our first glass of wine.  We considered staying one more day in LV just so we could go back.  But I guarantee that we'll be back to Juan's Flaming Fajitas again!
