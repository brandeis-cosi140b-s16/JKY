I SO love Dick's.  Thank goodness for punctuation, or that sentence would read a little differently. ;)

Their food is delicious.  They grill over pecan wood.  Their specials menu always has the most delicious items on it, like the NY Strip with fresh crab, hollandaise (which was amazing, normally I find this sauce lacking), and spicy chipotle sauce.  Well worth the money, for sure.

Most of the specials items are a little pricey (and well worth it!), so if you're looking for a less expensive alternative, go with the bacon-wrapped shrimp appetizer, as it's only about $15 and is definitely a full meal.  

Be careful with the garlic appetizer.  While it's OUTSTANDING, the next day may be a little...windy. ;)

The wine list is great - several selections, and many are moderately priced (especially their happy hour specials).  And they have a good draft beer selection.  

The service is always spot on.

The place is SUPER TINY and intimate, which I love, but also means that you need to walk in with a good attitude, knowing that you might need to wait a bit for a spot at the bar or one of the three little tables.  There is also a private room you can reserve, I believe, for dining with a bigger party.
