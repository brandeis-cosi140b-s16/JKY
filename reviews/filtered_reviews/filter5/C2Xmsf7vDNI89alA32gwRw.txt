My go to place for music,  food and drinks. Wednesdays they have a flamenco show,  fantastic!  Other times they have a band that plays jazzy sort of music, love it!! The jalape√±o drinks are yummy,  the tacos are amazing! ! The bartenders are super nice,  specially the tall blond guy with curly hair ponytail (I'm really bad with names). Check out the pool and the roof top bar. You won't be disappointed! !
