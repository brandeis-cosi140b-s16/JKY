Yeah it's a tad pricey for the portion sizes.  But oh wow, you'll savor every bite!   I love Chinese and Mexican food, but this restaurant takes these cuisines to a level I never imagined.  If you want food with a complexity of flavors and nuance, you'll enjoy China Poblano .  If you want a whole bunch of mediocre grub, then go to a buffet.  I'll take quality over quantity anytime.
