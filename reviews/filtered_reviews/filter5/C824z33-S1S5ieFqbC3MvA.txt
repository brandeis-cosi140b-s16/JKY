Yes, I definitely whole heatedly agree, 5 stars across the board. 
Santos Luchas Libre is similar to Bajio (or Chipotle), but really takes the concept to a fine level. There are several more options to customize your meal, and the menu is much more authentic Mexican food. There is of course the Lucha Libre theme as well- colorful masked pro wrestling, and the bright colors and masks are abundant throughout. 

When I entered, I was immediately greeted warmly by staff, and it seemed like they were possibly the owners. I was asked if I had been in before and I replied that I hadn't, so I was offered samples of about 6 different meats. I can't remember each one's description, but I do know that each bite was equally flavorful and delicious, with the chicken standing out slightly as being the most tasty. 
There are many choices of how you want your meat served, besides burritos/tacos, like tortas or nachos. One thing that stood out in particular, is guacamole is only an additional 99Â¢. The ordering counter, cashier and fountain drinks are in one room, and after paying, you turn the corner to see a nice variety of choices at the salsa bar, and very comfortable booths in the dining room.

I got a chicken burrito with rice, pinto beans,  cheese, lettuce, and guac, on a tomato tortilla. They also had white, wheat, chipotle and spinach tortillas, whichever you prefer. It was delicious and I added medium red salsa to it.

Disclaimer- their hot salsas are actually hot. Like, too hot for me. I was impressed. And in pain after the green salsa. Oh my. Really though, *that* spicy! Ow!

Tip- 50 percent off 2nd item with Yelp checkin!

I will definitely be back soon!
