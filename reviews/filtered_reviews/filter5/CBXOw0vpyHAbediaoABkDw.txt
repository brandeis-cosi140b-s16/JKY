Not a big 5 star guy. This is a 5 star place. I thought the service was outstanding from the start. We brought our 1 year old and she had a blast there, and the wait staff LOVED interacting with her. They could teach the "industry" people something, the ones who shun children at their tables.

The server had so much great information and recommendations, down to the food. We got the quesadillas and a couple of their burritos. Everything tasted fantastic. This is probably the best Mexican I've had in the valley. I will say it's not cheap, but the atmosphere and being in the upscale Scottsdale Quarter justifies the price. Great job with this restaurant.
