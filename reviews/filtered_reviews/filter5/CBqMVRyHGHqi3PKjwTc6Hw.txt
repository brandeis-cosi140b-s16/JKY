La Pinata is located along Phoenix's North 19th Avenue. This delightful restaurant shares a parking lot with a number of other businesses. The parking lot is small and can fill up quickly. At busy times you might have to park on one of the side streets to access La Pinata Mexican Food Restaurant.

Hate to judge whether Mexican restaurants are "authentic" or for "Gringos only." Don't care. Would much rather judge a restaurant on its own merits. Judging La Pinata on its own merits, this is one fantastic Mexican restaurant!

The interior is a little old and worn but La Pinata is still cozy and intimate. The menu is large and the prices are fantastic. You can easily have a large combination Mexican feast at La Pinata for around 10 bucks. The salsa, chips, Spanish rice, and beans are all first class. Service is all smiles and very knowledgeable about the menu.

Our server was from Mexico City. She explained that La Pinata's tacos are the way the make tacos in Mexico City. If they serve tacos like that in Mexico City then I think I'll plan my next vacation for Mexico City. La Pinata has homemade clam shell shaped tortillas. Inside the clam shell tortillas are large pieces of marinated pork or beef. Indescribably delicious and enough to send me into fits of ecstasy.

If ever you want a delicious inexpensive Mexican meal served up with some warm hospitality then La Pinata Mexican Food Restaurant is the place to go!
