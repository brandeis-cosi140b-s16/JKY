The absolute BEST mexican food I have had, ever! And that's saying alot from someone who was born and raised in Texas. Not only was the food great, but it was set in a terrific atmosphere. The restuarant was built around a lake where ducks hang out while you dine. This is a must visit if you are ever in the Phoenix area.
