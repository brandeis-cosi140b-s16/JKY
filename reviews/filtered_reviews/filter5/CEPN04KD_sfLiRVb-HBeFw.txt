Been to Nando's at least 25 times.  Both the big restaurant and the "Hideaway" for breakfast.  I always see the same employees, people are always friendly and fast.  I love the happy hour food -- the mexican Pizza is awesome.  I love the beans, the enchiladas, the chips, the salsa.  The house margaritas are strong and delicious.  Yes, the food is cheesy and Americanized but it is delicious!  I have rarely seen such consistency in a restaurant.  This place will be around for a long time.  Excellent management and organization.
