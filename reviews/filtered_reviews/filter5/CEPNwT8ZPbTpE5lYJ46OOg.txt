Lol don't let fellow yelpers get you down. This place is great. My family and I have been coming here for the last 10 years or so and have never been disappointed. I feel the staff is friendly, generous, and very helpful. The food makes me feel like I am back at home. Very authentic and just the right amount of spice (for me). I usually order the machaca chimichanga or machaca enchiladas. Both are excellent. They have some of the best cheese enchiladas in town and my family loves their tacos. It's quite a drive from our East Mesa home, but we always find time to make a trip down there.
