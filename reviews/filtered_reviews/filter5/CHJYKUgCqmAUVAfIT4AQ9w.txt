This place is really good, before reading on this place is cash only!!!!! 

Where do I start? I only has the chicken so far, and it was amazing they take their time when making your food. The chicken was tender and juicy and flavored just right, it comes with a side of beans and pickled onions (weird I know) but it works, you also get a choice of corn or flour tortilla. When it comes to good ol Mexican cooked chicken or carne asada this place is legit I will be stopping by since this place is close to me I only wish I found out sooner even though I drove passed this place many of times.
