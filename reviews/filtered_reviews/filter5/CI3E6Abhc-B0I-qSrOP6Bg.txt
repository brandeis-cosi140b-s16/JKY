The most amazing tacos I ever had. Went on a friday afternoon and the place was packed. Not easy to get a table, long lines that move really slow, but it's worth the wait and the pushing. The "must have" are the Tacos de lengua and tacos de tripa. Sopes and quesadillas are good. Don't forget to ask for your free tostadas, guacamole and salsa.
