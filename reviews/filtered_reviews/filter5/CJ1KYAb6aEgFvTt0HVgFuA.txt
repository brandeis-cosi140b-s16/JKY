We have been fans of Los Sombreros at the original Scottsdlae Rd location for years. We renewed our friendship this past weekend. We had been going to the newer Northsight Rd location because it is closer to our house. Unfortunately, it has closed and we sort of forgot about the original. We are very happy we stopped in to have dinner. The food was as good and original as it has always been. We've always liked the patio with it's fluffy trees better. We reconnected with our friends on the loyal staff. My favorite dish is the hibiscus enchiladas and my husband had rellenos. Both are prepared in the style of Central Mexico. This is a little different from the usual border, Tex-Mex style of most local places.

If you've been going to the Northsight location and found it closed, drive a little further south and go to the original. It is worth a trip!
