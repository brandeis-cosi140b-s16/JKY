A-ma-zing tacos. We've been back every day since we discovered the $2 tacos. The staff is super friendly and sociable (although it may help if you speak in Spanish). I always get the fish (there's fried and grilled), and they cook it when you order it. Also, if you like spicy food, this is the place! Their spiciest salsa left my husband and I crying. People who have left negative comments about the atmosphere are in the wrong place. This is amazing food and should be judged for what it is, not against the fancy, 5-star restaurants on the strip. Give it a try!
