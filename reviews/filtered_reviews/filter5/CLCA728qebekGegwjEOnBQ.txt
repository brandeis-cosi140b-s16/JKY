Tacos. Al. Pastor. 

Taco Tijuana is one of the best places to purchase Al Pastor tacos in town (located on Tropicana and Topaz), and for about $2 a taco with a friendly staff making them, we are going to be repeat customers whenever we get a taco craving.

Unlike other places, your tacos will be packed with meat and swimming with flavor (I order mine with everything on it). Personally, I squirt a ton of lime juice on mine because I love the taste. The meat in the tacos have great texture variety with some crisp that makes every bite more addicting. 

Refreshment options available for purchase: bottled water, canned soda, and there is a horchata fountain with many flavors available. 

Procedure: Pay the cashier, drop your order sheet off on the side, choose your seats, pick your order up, and enjoy your delicious tacos. Tacos also come with a plate of grilled pepper and onions that pair together beautifully!
