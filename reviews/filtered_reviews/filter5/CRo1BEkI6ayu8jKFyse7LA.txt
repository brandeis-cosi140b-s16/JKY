The food is always so good when we come here! The Kahlua pig is awesome and don't forget to try their coconut bark while you're there. Right now they have a pumpkin bark which is their normal bark but with a "fall flavor". We just found out they do a holiday bark, too, after thanksgiving. Cannot wait to try that one!
