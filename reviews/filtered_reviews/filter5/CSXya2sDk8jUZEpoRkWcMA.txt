After being unimpressed with the reviews of the strip Mexican places we decided to cab it out here (a mile or so) and glad we did. Great food, and didn't feel like a Vegas chain but more like some of the family restaurants out this way in California. The traditional mole sauce was killer. Waiter made the guacamole right at the table, adding jalepenos to suit the requested amount of hotness (lots). Excellent, attentive service. One of the better choices for Mexican in Vegas.
