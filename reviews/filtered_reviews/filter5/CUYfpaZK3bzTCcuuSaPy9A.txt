I'm glad to have given this place a try!  Mother's Day weekend, the family and I went on a little Sunday drive and had just hit Wickenburg when the hunger pangs started.  This was a great little find!

The salsas were very good, something that seems to be rare in these here parts.  I don't think we ever saw the bottom of our chip basket or our water glasses, the service was so attentive.  Our table ordered nachos, an ala carte taco, shredded beef chimichanga and the quesadilla.  The nachos were loaded with toppings and a healthy dollop of sour cream and guacamole.  Oh, how I love it when a place isn't stingy with their guac!  The beef inside the chimichanga was delicious, and the outside was perfectly cooked - light and crispy.  I tried to sneak a taste of the quesadilla, but I was nearly stabbed with a fork, so I take that as a sign that it was pretty darn good.

But the star of the show was certainly the taco.  I opted for ground beef, but they have a choice of shredded beef, ground beef and chicken.  I'm sure this thing would be good if it were filled with stinky gym socks.  The shell is no pre-packaged, grocery store shell.  Oh no sir.  It was fabulously crispy and held the filling very well.  No soggy bottoms here!

After the great service and great food, they went above and beyond when it was time to pay the bill.  I was given a lovely yellow rose for Mother's Day!  It was such a nice gesture!

This is definitely now on our go-to list of places to eat when we're in Wickenburg!
