Our favorite Mexican restaurant,  by far. We've been coming here for years.  Always fresh food and terrific service. Well,  unless you get the one "grumpy" waitress. We usually see her in during breakfast. Never smiles and seems to be upset she has to help us. This is not a one time "Maybe she was having a bad day" thing. She's always grumpy to us. This should not stop anyone from going here. Every other employee here is super nice and friendly. That's the only reason Grumpy is so noticeable. Who knows?  Maybe she just doesn't like the look of my face! Plus, you have to try the food here. The soups are amazing. Not just the small cup of fideo soup they bring before the entr√©e,  the dinner soups are the best. In fact, our family has never had a bad meal. Every time we go,  whatever we order is fantastic. The dining area and Restrooms are always clean. They even have live music. For an even better experience, try the table side guacamole or the flaming ice cream dessert. That's right, "flaming!"  To sum up: One grumpy apple does not spoil the bunch. This outstanding restaurant gets Five well deserved stars!
