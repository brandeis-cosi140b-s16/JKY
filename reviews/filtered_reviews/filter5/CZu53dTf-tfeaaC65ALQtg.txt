Goodbye chipotle, hello Brushfire!  Went for the first time today.  Shrimp burrito with verde sauce.  AWESOME!  The burrito was huge and very fresh.  Used the drive thru that was a little tight in a crew cab truck but no worse than the In & Out burger 2 miles away.  

I will be going back frequently.  Enjoy it while it is still new and not all that busy.  I can see Brushfire taking off and opening franchises across the country.  Great concept!
