Lets start out saying I went here for my BIRTHDAY, that's how much I love this place.

Everything I have gotten from this place has been over the top delicious! Mexican food is my absolute favorite, and they kill it with the beans and rice. I'm starting off talking about the beans and rice because UM HELLO they complement the meal and they totally nailed it.

THE CHIPS AND SALSA ARE SO GOOD I MUST WRITE IN ALL CAPS TO TRULY INFORM YOU, THE READER, ABOUT THEIR GREATNESS.

Now, for things I can suggest to you because sadly I have not been there enough to try the whole menu (but I will some day, mark my words) are... 

the roasted chicken tacos and the roasted mushroom tacos are honestly way too good, its probably illegal for me to be talking about such delicious plates on here. ALSO, if you think sometimes soft shell corn tacos are not that great, these ones will totally change your mind about soft shell corn tacos, and your eyes will turn into hearts.

green chili pork enchiladas, where do I even start!!! My boyfriend had ordered them and lets just say I was so full I was about to explode and I still had like four bites because they were absolutely amazing. The meat, the cheese, perfectly stacked (which, in my eyes is the only way enchiladas should ever be) in a hot skillet, and they are sent from the heavens above. 

If you are feeling simple and love cheese crisps, they are quite exquisite and not overdone with the cheese so they are not greasy. Super yummy.

THE DESSERTS! Totally worth trying them all, even though you could die due to food consumption overload, they are all very tasty!!!
