The airport Barrio Cafe has the best nachos I have ever had in my life... Trust me I have had a lot of nachos.  These are foodie nachos not yellow cheese game day nachos.  Last time I was at Barrio Queen they did not have them at that location.  Nachos plus a fabulous margarita here are the start to a great trip either for business or pleasure!
