Best authentic tacos I've ever had. So tasty & really cheap. Anything with their adobada meat is amazing. I recommend adobada tacos with extra creamy green sauce and adobada fries! A half order of their carne asada or adobada fries can feed probably 3 people. They're usually not too busy whenever I stop by, but you never know how busy they'll get since it's right at the end of the strip. Customer service is usually great. The parking lot is kinda shady so lock your car doors. Other than that, I think this place is awesome.
