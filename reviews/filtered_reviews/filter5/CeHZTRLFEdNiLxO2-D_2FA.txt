¡Sí!

My old stand-by phrase is, "A lot of places serve good Mexican food."  It's true--there are tons of places that will serve up a burrito or rellenos nice and neat, no problem.

And then, there's Mi Patio.  Do you ever get that feeling at the end of a meal where you are completely full but the food tasted so good that you want to continue eating?  That's how I felt here.  These were some of the best enchiladas I have ever tasted.  The rice was authentic, and I ate every speck of the beans.  I often don't finish the beans when I eat at a Mexican joint because they usually taste. . .blah.  No blah here--just REALLY good.  Distinct salsa flavor--more chips please!

My new favorite for Mexifood in the Valley.  There's good places closer to me, but for great, I'll travel a few extra miles to come here.
