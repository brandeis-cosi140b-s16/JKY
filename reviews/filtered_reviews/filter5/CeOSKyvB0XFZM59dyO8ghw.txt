We have been coming here for years, and have lived in the gilbert/east valley area. They are family owned and have kept the same fresh madd ingrediants for years . thr fact that they are fsmily opperated and treat guests as their own family brings value and speaks silently about this families character and persona. The tortas are amazing , although they do not make tortas aogadas like authentuc guadalajara does, their tortas al pastor are amazing. Also the carnitas tacos are marinated in days and slow cooked to a perfect crisp for tacos. I highly highly recommened eating here for great ahthentic mexican food.
