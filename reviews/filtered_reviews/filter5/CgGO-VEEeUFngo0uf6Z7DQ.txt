Simply magnificent. Easily the best Mexican food I've had the pleasure of enjoying in the States. I can't stop thinking about the carne asada Torta. The rice and beans are the best I've eaten. Tacos are simple and delicious. The most exciting part about it is that I get to go back and try the famed Bombero Burrito and other, more "exotic" things like the lengua and menudo!

You must go!
