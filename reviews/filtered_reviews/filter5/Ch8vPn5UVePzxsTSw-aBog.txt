Absolutely adorable place: delicious dishes, excellent service, beautiful decor with modern art paintings and Arizona and Texas State Flags on the wall.

Z'Tejas means "the Texas". They serve a good mix of Mexican and American food. 

The presentation of the food is amazing as well. Pretty heavy though, think we over ordered, but omgosh they are all fantastic picks!
