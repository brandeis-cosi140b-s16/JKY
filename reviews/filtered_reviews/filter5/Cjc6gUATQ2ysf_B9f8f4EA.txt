I was in between meetings at Planet Hollywood and looking for a good lunch spot...Yolos was the perfect choice. We started with the chips and 3 dips...the chips were perfectly crispy with just enough salt and I loved the regular salsa and mango salsa. For my entree, I had tacos with cilantro rice. My favorite taco was the carne asada and my co-worker loved her fajitas. Everything was tasty and the service was super friendly and attentive!
