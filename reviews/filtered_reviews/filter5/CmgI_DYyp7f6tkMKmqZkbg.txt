Wow we just ate here last night and it was really good with good service. If you like spicy food don't miss out on this place!

The carne adovada relleno is wonderful.  My wife had a special they had for mothers day and she said it was one of the best meals ever.  


Honestly don't know what happened on the nights where others gave bad reviews it was most certianly not our experience.
