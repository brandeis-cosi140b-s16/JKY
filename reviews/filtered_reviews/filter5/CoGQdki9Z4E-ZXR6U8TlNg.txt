This place is so delicious.  From the cops to the flan. We will definately be back! I hade the Carne Asada with the three meats. Sorry I  don't have a picture to post.  Amber was our server and made or dining experience just that much better. Even the young man who brought us chips and salsa was added to our delicious experience. Thank you Tia Rosa, we will be back.
