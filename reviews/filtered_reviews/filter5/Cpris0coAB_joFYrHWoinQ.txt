I had never heard of this place until recently.  I'm a fan of mexican food from around the valley and when offered to try this place I was up for it.  The first time I ate here it was amazing, and everytime after has been better.  In the last month i've probably eaten here about 6 times.

The 1 thing I would like change about this place is they need more variety when it comes to salsa, I personally would like something hotter, but aside from that this is as good as it gets either for a quick fast food mexican type place or a sit down authentic restaurant.
