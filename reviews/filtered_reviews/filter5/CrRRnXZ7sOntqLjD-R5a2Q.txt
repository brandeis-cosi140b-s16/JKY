Maybe I'm a bit bias due to my Oregon Ducks backing, but like all Duck fans, I just don't give a shit.  Unreal, and I mean unreal service...  We were at the same table all night and must have had 5 separate waiters/waitresses check on us.  

Great Margaritas and Bloodies, the best Chicken Wings in Scottsdale and a crazy bar menu.

The College Football bar specials on Saturdays are off the charts, especially if you "Love My Ducks."

Great bar, great food, unreal service.-
