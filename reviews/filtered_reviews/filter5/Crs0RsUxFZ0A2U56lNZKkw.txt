I consider myself more of a taco person than burrito, but I absolutely LOVE the pollo burrito and have trouble moving past it to try other things.  Finally tried chicken enchiladas recently, but have to go back to my burrito.  My husband likes the carne asada burrito.  Can easily eat here weekly!  Always a crowd, always friendly workers, always fun to see what other people order!
