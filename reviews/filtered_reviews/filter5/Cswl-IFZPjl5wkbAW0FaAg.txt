the only thing i can review is the bean and cheese burrito, because that's all i get and it's all i ever need.

their refried beans are the creamiest, most savory in all of phoenix (i would except for casa reynoso, except this is owned by the same family!).

i can't even find words for much i enjoy their perfect tortillas. but i can say that i can gobble a burrito up in about 45 seconds, and i am the world's slowest eater. 

true story.
