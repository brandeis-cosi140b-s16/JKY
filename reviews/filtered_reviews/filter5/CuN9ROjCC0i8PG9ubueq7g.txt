I dare you to find a better salsa! The green salsa, the orange, and the burrito factory salsa at the salsa bar are hands down the best salsa I have ever had. I seem to always get the curry burrito (yeah sounds odd for a Mexican place) but it's a very barely there curry taste. The tofu burritos great too. The owner and servers are very kind and nice. But I'm serious...THE BEST SALSA.  I don't know why but south blvd has a large Hispanic community and horribly bad restaurants but the burrito factory is a rare gem!
