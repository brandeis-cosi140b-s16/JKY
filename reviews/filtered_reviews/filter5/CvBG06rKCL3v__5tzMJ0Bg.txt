It is a chain, but, I'll try not to hold that against it. The food was very good and some of the better Mexican food I've had in awhile. The shrimp fajita salad was just what I ordered, and my buddy loved his plate. He's a regular here, so, you know it's gotta be good!  I suggest trying the papas....es mui bueno!!

The service was good, a bit mechanized...but again, that's a chain thing.
