I love Chino Bandido for several reasons.  The black beans are strange, but tasty.  The chinese bbq pork and emerald chicken never fail to please me.  Who couldn't love the amazing snickerdoodles? (My favorite cookie, by the way, and they do it justice!)  When I am feeling a bit indecisive, this is the ideal place.  Plus, the staff are super nice and are willing to explain anything or set you up with a sample to try new things.  Definitely a favorite of mine.
