Sometimes life throws you lemons in the form of flight delays. Blanco is a perfect place to make lemonade with it, preferably with vodka!

Located in Terminal 4 of the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, it's on the A gates end of the terminal. Which makes it about a 10-minute trek (faster if you run on the walkalators) from the D gates where we arrived. Even faster if you manage to catch a ride with a skycap (totally worth the experience on its own). If you have a longer layover, do not settle for less!

This place hits all the hallmarks of a good airport restaurant - quick to seat, serve, and get you on your way. In addition, their prices are *extremely* reasonable for an airport restaurant and the food is absolutely delicious!

Absolutely try the carnitas. Among the best I've had, it was moist and very flavorful. I'm not a huge fan of flour tortillas, so I ordered a no-tortilla buritto, expecting it to come out in little piles of ingredients on a plate. The kitchen must've read my mind, though, because it came out as a buritto bowl - the stuff of my naked burrito dreams! The rice was al dente and rich, loaded with butter, I believe. Black beans were tender and well-seasoned. Topped with pico de gallo and a light sprinkling of cojita cheese. Everything in my bowl just worked and I was a happy happy camper. They make a rocking guacamole with roasted poblanos and a really zippy red salsa, served with freshly fried tortilla chips. All this with a lovely Barrio Brewing Co. Tuscon Blonde draft. You won't need that in-flight bag o' pretzels and complimentary beverage.

There are power outlets at the tables and high tops, so you can charge up more than your tummy before your flight. It was busy the whole time we were there but they didn't rush us at all. Can't wait to be stranded at PHX again :)
