Love this place. Favorite things: free salsa bar for dine in, multiple iced tea selection, cheap prices and large portions. Staff is always really nice and will check on you even though it is not "full service" (I usually leave a tip because of this). The taco salad is loaded with meat and is only 5.95. I also love their red chili burrito which is also huge and only 4.95. 
Very casual dining, similar to Pei Wei you order at the counter and they give you a number and you seat yourself.  If you dine in they will offer you a bowl of chips and they have a salsa bar with 5 different kinds of fresh home-made salsas. I like to mix the Pico with the Hot!
The food is brought out very quickly. They have a few nice big flat screens in the dining area and usually have sports or weather on. They offer a few patio tables and have a decent beer selection as well. I think its a great little local place and worth checking out.
