Javier's has all figured out .... Service, Decor, Ambiance, Cocktails, and .... The flavours !!! With a large group and everyone enjoyed their experience. Make sure you make a reservation and have one of their signature jalape√±o margaritas - SO tasty and not like you are probably thinking it might be like. Thoroughly enjoyed the salsa and chips and had the Cabo Azul for dinner - excellent.
