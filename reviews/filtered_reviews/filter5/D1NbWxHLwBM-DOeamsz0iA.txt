Amazing! When is this spot going to appear on food network?! Imagine an old drive through fast food restaurant that was redone in the most fashionable way. It is a mix between a five guys/modern diner with a great vibe inside with amazing staff!! The food omg!! It's a small menu of tacos and burgers! Maybe 5 items on the menu but you can't go wrong with anything. Personally if you haven't bee to this spot order a standard burger with cheese, fries and when they ask you if you want a side of ketchup and stand sauce.. ask for both! Amaaazing!!!
