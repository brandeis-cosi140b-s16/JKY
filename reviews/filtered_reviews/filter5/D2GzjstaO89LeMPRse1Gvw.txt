Absolutely delicious! And Gluten friendly! The Margharitas are to die for!

I've had the chile rellenos with beef, they come in a delicious sauce and no egg batter, very yummy

The Rib eye Steak was cooked to perfection the side salad and chiles toreados were delicious and fresh oh so fresh!

The Carnitas de puerco are well, fatty as they should be.

In December they had Champurrado and tamales utterly sinful deliciousness.

By the way for those who posted bad reviews, Leticias does not serve yellow cheese, so if you were expecting  Tex Mex this is not the place, this is very authentic mexican dishes, made as if in mexico.  

And unfortunately to the couple that went there for valentines day, i was there too, it was super crowded and hectic. I have ordered the fish tacos and i didn't like them either, it was exactly how the review said it, shredded or ground fish yuck and almost non of it in the taco, so I suggest against the fish tacos. But everything else just makes up for it! It really does!
