Viva Michoacan is definitely my family's favorite mexican restaurant in Las Vegas. Every time they visit me in Las Vegas, we make sure that this restaurant is in our schedule of events :) The food is incredible...guacamole is to die for and the ambiance is fantastic. And sometimes you even get a treat of the music/band....that one singer can really hold a note :) I hope he is still there. Anyways, I strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone that appreciates authentic mexican food. "Table for 1?...umm yes please!" ...no shame in my food game. LOL!
