Holy Guacamole batman that was a big surprise.  I don't do 5 star reviews much, but Habanero's gets one.  I had the lobster and blackened fish tacos and bravo well done, some of the best I've had.  I've eaten plenty of tacos from North to South and East to West and a few in Mexico.  I would add that it should come with guacamole, I had some ordered separately.    Fajitas were good as well.  Service was delightful.
