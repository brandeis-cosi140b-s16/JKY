I think i have been to this place about 7 times in the last 3 weeks since i tried it for the first time after reading reviews. I love how fresh everything is, the corn tortillas are handmade in house and are awesome. I use to have to go down to EL GORDOS but now i dont have to travel 20 min to get my taco fix. Thank you Taco y Taco for providing quality food at affordable prices. I will be a frequent customer i promise. I actually met one of the owners the other day when i was there and was able to tell her how much i liked the place. Everything i have tried so far has been great well maybe except the burrito I will prob still go to chipotle for that. The flour tortillas there are just way better. But everything else has been the bomb!!!
