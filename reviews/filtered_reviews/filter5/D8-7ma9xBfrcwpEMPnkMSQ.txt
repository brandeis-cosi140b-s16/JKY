100% authentic. If you're looking for a place that has great table side guacamole and awesome corn tortilla tacos this is the place. Pork shoulder and mahi mahi tacos are highly recommended. 

Staff was very attentive and the atmosphere was great. If you get a chance to eat outside in their back courtyard I would high recommend it.
