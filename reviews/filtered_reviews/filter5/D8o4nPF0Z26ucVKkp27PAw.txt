This is one of my all time favorite places to go! Who would have thought that mixing Mexican and Chinese food would be a good idea? Definitely not me... at least until you try it!

My usual order: Jade red chicken, cheese quesadilla, black beans and chicken fried rice... and top it off with their snickerdoodle!

The ordering scheme is a little odd at first, but the workers behind the counter are always willing to help. And if you've never been before, they're always willing to let you try anything first. So yummy and definitely worth the drive to get there!
