Coming from San Diego, Ca, the supposed land of amazing Mexican food, I don't think I've had better (american-style) Mexican food in my life. I swear. I was dumbfounded by the deliciousness of each and every course my party and I ordered. Please do yourself a favor and order the following items: table-side Guacamole, table-side shaken ceviche, and the chicken enchiladas. I was taken aback at the flavor all these items had. We dined in early on a Saturday night and couldn't stop eating until each of us were stuffed. Nonetheless, we all planned on drinking back at the hotel room so I can't quite comment on the drinks. 

The service was exceptional. Our server (wish I remembered his name) was very honest and helped us navigate the large menu. I wish we had better seats (we were tucked away in the back and away from everyone else) and I will definitley come back and try more of these items next time I stay at the MGM. In fact, I say the restaurant row at the MGM is quite impressive (see my review for Craftsteak).
