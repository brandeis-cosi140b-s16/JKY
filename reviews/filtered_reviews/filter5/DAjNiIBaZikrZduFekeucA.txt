Love it!  The carne asada is so good in my opinion.  The shop is cute also, not much seating but if you don't go at prime time you will not have a problem.  I ate here twice last week because I was craving it so much!
I also really liked their salsa and chips, more the salsa, and they keep it in the fridge so its super cold when they give it to you which I really like.  I just have had the quesadilla with carne asada so I can't say anything else about the rest of the food.  They could give you a bigger piece of lime with your meal though! :)
