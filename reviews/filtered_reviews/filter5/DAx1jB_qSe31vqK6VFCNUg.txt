I have only been here once but it won't be the last time. 
The food here is so fresh and the salsa selection; i have never seen anything like it and it's all so fresh and interesting. 
The ambiance has a lot of character but people come here for the food. I just had tacos and was blown away by the flavor. 
The shells were good but the meat was seasoned nice, the veggies were crisp and the staff were awesome. I will definitely be going back!
