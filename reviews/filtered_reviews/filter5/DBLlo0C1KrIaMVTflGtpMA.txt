We travel a ridiculous distance to get to Leticia's (according to our friends)...  But we used to live a couple of miles away in Centennial Hills, and now that we have moved to Henderson, our "couple of minutes" drive changed to a "little over a half hour" drive.  But, um, we still do it...  Here's a quick list of why:
1) Best Margarita in the valley.  Well, if you like them... I know, every place makes them differently, but here they use multiple fresh squeezed lime slices and that works with the pattern of fresh food here, and it's really tasty.
2) Best interesting drink - the Pomegranite Margatini is totally unique and I can't even list all of the ingredients here...  But it's one of my wife's favorite drinks of all time!
3) Ignacia - oh, yeah, the Margatini is generally only a good drink if she's the one who makes it.  Everything she makes is awesome, even if she's taking care of the bar and the entire dining room at the same time...
4) Ignacia again - sorry to be redundant, but beyond drinks, she knows the food and what mama's making, and knows what is good, and very quickly learns what you like!  Which is invaluable... Even if you don't know what to order, just let her do it.
5) To be fair, even if Ignacia is not working, the food is all fantastic and the drinks are awesome.  I just wish they'd open a place in Henderson!
