I am biased because I love Soho and i followed chef John and Nunu over here, but how could you not? They took the concept of the sushi burrito and blew it up and continue to use the same high quality of fish in the process. I love that they are the first ones to bring this to Las Vegas. I love that there are so many choices of fish, toppings and sauces to choose from. And I love that they created this restaurant entirely of recycled materials. 

Who cares if there's a wait? When you finally sit down and bask in the burritos glory, it's worth it. How many restaurants do we go to without a reservation and it's a standard 20 to 30min. wait and when you finally sit down, you still have to wait approximately another 30 to 45min. from ordering and actually cooking your food. I don't think anyone ever thought this would have blown up so quickly so we can't blame them for trying to catch up and figure out their flow. 

Anyways, I like building my own burritos because I get greedy with my toppings and protein. You can use fish, chicken, beef, tofu, tempura or soft shell crab as your protein. You can use seaweed or rice paper as your official wrap to seal your burrito. And you can even get brown rice. 

I also love the Jachos. Something about the queso and lightly sugared taro chips just go so well together. You can even customize your Jachos as well. If you're too lazy to add your own toppings, you won't regret getting Long Beach Jachos. Also I need to know where they are getting these Japanese melon and mango drinks from because they compliment the meal perfectly.
