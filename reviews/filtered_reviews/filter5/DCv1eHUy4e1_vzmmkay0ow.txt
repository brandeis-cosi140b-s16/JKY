Calamari fries are phenomenal and the tacos, beans and rice are delicious.  Our server, Brittany, was attentive, knowledgeable of the menu and had excellent social skills.

The prices are a bargain in my opinion ($9 for two fish tacos with rice and beans).  The atmosphere is laid back and fun.  I think we found our new favorite place in downtown Gilbert.
