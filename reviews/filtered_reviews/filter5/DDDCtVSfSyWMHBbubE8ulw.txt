The service is quick and the atmosphere is excellent.  One of my favorite Mexican restaurants I've been to since moving to the Valley from San Diego.  The thing that struck me with the food was the high quality of ingredients.  Mi Abuelo's Manjar with the eggs over medium is a perfect dish that really comes together when the egg yolk gets in the mix.

The prices are very reasonable and the courtyard in the center of the restaurant is stunning!  The first time I ate here, I was so impressed that I got a gift card for some friends to come and have some for themselves.  Give Abuelo's a try and you won't be disappointed.
