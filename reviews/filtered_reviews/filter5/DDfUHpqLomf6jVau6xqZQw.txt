THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO.

Went to this place on Friday night when I arrived in Vegas.  I have to say that i love this place.

Great beer...Great Food....  and the DANCERS on the bar were OFF THE HOOK.

If you are a big girl or dorky guy who don't have much self Esteem, I wouldn't go here if I Were you.  Also, if you are the jealous type who don't like your man looking at other women DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING HERE.

The booty on the bar is definitely  some of the best in Vegas (and they don't charge for you to look)

The Girls working there walk around 1/2 dressed and will give you a shot of booze (watered down of course) for free.  They dance on the bar and let's just say...  you can't really look at anything else.

I will be going back
