I wish this place was closer to my house! I think I would be there everyday! I got 2 enchiladas with the 1/2 and 1/2 tortilla with one mashed potato and one with chicken! I think I could of eaten a whole bowl of mashed potato. They add either green or red, or even both sauces and cheese and put it in their brick oven and add some cabbage slaw! Everything just tasted so fresh! I will be going back very soon!
