Comfortable hangout with a great bar and uber-fresh tacos.  Of the three tacos I sampled (Conchinta Pibil, Pollo Rojo, and Fish), the fish won the round.  It was lightly breaded mahi piping hot with super cool and crunchy citrus slaw.  Loved it!  The Conchinita was smokin' with great heat right over the plate.  Thankfully, Budweiser was there to offer relief. 

Carla, my server, was friendly and explained the menu.  Once I figure out parking, I'm coming back and with friends in tow.  Nice job!
