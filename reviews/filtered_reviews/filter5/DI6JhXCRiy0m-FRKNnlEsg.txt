I eat at Flamings all the time!! The food is excellent but the service is outstanding. Recently celebrated a family bday there with 12 people. Our server went out of his way to make sure our needs were taken care of. We has fajitas, steak tacos, ceviche, and a couple other entrees. All very good and the soup!  Love it...
