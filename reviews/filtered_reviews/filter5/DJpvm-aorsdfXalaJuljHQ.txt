Don't let the shabbiness of this place fool you! This is a true gem if you enjoy Mexican food. This place lives up to its great reviews when I came here it was a full house and the prices are reasonable. I ordered the chimichanga but to make it vegan I had them substitute the meat with vegetables and remove the cheese and sour cream . They were more than happy to accommodate my dietary needs which tells me this place makes their food fresh  ! If you haven't been here your missing out!!
