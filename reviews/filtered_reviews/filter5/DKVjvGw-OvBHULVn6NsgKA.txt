This place was really good. My fianc√© and I visited Charlotte last weekend. I had a grilled chicken taco and their signature Paco taco. Both very good. Spicy red rice and black beans had a good Spanish flavor. The waiter recommended I try the Paco el dorado which is a margarita they serve which was amazingly delicious. Overall quite pleased with our first visit here!
