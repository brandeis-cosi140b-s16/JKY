We had a fantastic first experience at Mundo!

Hosts were polite and friendly on the phone when making our reservation. We even called a couple hours before our dinner to ask to move our reservation to an hour later. She was extremely accommodating and made the change. 

We were promptly seated upon arrival and told that a reality tv show would be filmed near our table later in the evening. She wanted to give us the option of being out of the line of the cameras - no way!  This will be fun to watch!  Really hip room and we appreciated that the music wasn't so loud that we couldn't carry on a conversation like so many other Vegas restaurants. 

Our waiter was friendly and attentive. Our drink orders were filled immediately. He made sure we were aware of their evening special. The staff made sure our water glasses were never empty. 

Our food arrived in a timely manner....and it was outstanding!!!  My husband had the prime filet mignon with the Mexican risotto side. I had the strip steak with the Mexican street corn side. Steaks were lean and seasoned and cooked perfectly. The sides were delicious. We wished we had room for dessert!

Definitely give yourself some time to figure out the parking if you've never been to this area before. We ended up parking in the World Market parking garage - the entrance was on the back side of the building next to a loading dock area. Mundo's entrance is in a courtyard between the buildings. 

We are so happy to add this restaurant to our best of Vegas list!  We look forward to coming back! Thanks Mundo!
