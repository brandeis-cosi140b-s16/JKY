Ok so my first time have New Mexican food and I have to admit, I am a huge fan! I got the nachos, guac, christmas style enchiladas and churros. Everything was amazing!! However be ready for some heat because the food is spicy, but if you've read my reviews you know I love it. Other than the food, the service was great. Everyone from our amazing waitress Amy, to the owner, to even the other guests gave off a really warm feeling. It felt like we were in their home being cooked for. We will definitely be back!
