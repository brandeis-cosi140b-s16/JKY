Hipster taco place in a church? Really? 

Yeah, Really. This place is just awesome. I am by no sense of the word a "hipster", but it seems like that type of joint. But make no mistake, you're getting great food, great drinks, and TOP notch service.

Lets start with the tacos/food:
They have two styles: Old World and New World. Cherry steak, Chipoltle chicken, lamb, thai snapper, a bunch of tacos that deviate from the standard. But they are fantastic. Some of the best tacos i have ever had in the states. When i visited Phoenix, i came here three times and tried every taco on the menu. The thai snapper was my favorite. The tacos were pricy for what they were but the quality is great. 

Second, the bar:
Awesome. The bartenders are the best part of this place. We did a sampling of mezcal (first time id heard of it). The bartender (hipster guy with beard and tattoos) was just awesome. Told us all the nightlife spots, and knew about seemingly everything behind his bar. Explained how certain liquors were made, local craft beer selections, just awesome.  We came back one night just to talk to him and have some drinks.

Ambiance: Oh yeah, this place is a church. I dont know the history of the building, but its made to look like a church. Steeple, stained glass windows. I have never really been to church before so getting wasted in one was a pretty cool experience. Don't miss this place if your'e in Phoenix.
