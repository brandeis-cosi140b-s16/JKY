Because I'm a sucker for fish tacos...

Imperial Tacos & Beer is a bar-like setting if that matters. They have patio seating which was a big plus.

Ordered just simple stuff:

- Baja fish taco, shrimp taco, taco al pastor
- Corn salad
- Chips and guacamole

I'm a minimalist, because the simplest things reveal the true quality easily. They did it so well, in presentation, flavor and finishing touches.

Totally awesome.
