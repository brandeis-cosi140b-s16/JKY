I see a lot of mixed reviews for Gonzalez y Gonzalez but I've been here three times over the years and I've  come away with good experiences each time. I was in Vegas for my job and my co-workers wanted Mexican food. Vegas usually isn't where I come for Mexican but I'd eaten at Gonzalez y Gonzalez before so I recommended it. We were sat quickly and our guy Hector was quick with the chips & salsa. I really like the salsa here. It has a roasted flavor which I've yet to find anywhere else. I usually roll with the wet burrito but I was in a nacho mood that day so the Gonzalez Nachos it was ($10.95). Really good. Melted cheese, guacamole, sour cream and shredded chicken it was definitely a meal's worth of food. My coworkers went with a couple of enchilada plates and a street taco plate. Everyone liked everything they got (whew!). Service was friendly and the food came out fast. Hector had to separate tickets a couple ways (four tickets for food, two additional for alcoholic beverages) and he did it with no issues. While there's no doubt you could find better Mexican food in Vegas if you don't want to fight traffic leaving the Strip you could do much worse. Food comes out fast, service is friendly and prices (for Vegas) are pretty reasonable.
