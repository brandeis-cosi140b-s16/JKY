By far my favorite Mexican restaurant ever! The baha fish tacos were to die for! Seriously the best I've ever had. Been craving them since I first tried it! Sucks I live all the way in San Francisco:( the bottomless chips and salsa were also really good. Service was great and the atmosphere was nice! Definitely recommend and will be dining here the next time I'm back in town!
