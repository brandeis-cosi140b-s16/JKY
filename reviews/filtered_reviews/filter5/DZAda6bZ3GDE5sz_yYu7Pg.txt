This location has super friendly staff, seems like they are actually genuine when they are talking to you. Also the location this one is in is just super convenient,  I go here for lunch from work, just a quick drive across the street and boom now we are talking lunch. My favorite meat they have is either the chicken or fish everything else is a little sweet in my opinion but either way you can't go wrong. Oh and always make sure to get the Bark. Super delicious!
