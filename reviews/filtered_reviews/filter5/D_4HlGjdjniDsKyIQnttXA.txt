My family and I went here last weekend.  First off I have to say that my parents are big fans of Viva Mercado from previous locations.  It is my Dad's favorite restaurant so they were very excited when they opened up at this location on Sahara.  The atmosphere is great, good service and everyone was super friendly.  The menu is very extensive and it was hard to decide what to get.  I ordered the same thing as my dad which was the three item combination.  I got a cheese enchilada, chili relleno and a chorizo hard shell taco.  
Okay, can I just say how happy I was with everything?  The chorizo taco was delicious, not greasy, perfectly flavored and well seasoned.  The chili relleno was the star.  It was not overly breaded, but just right and the enchilada was great as well.  My sister got the Enchiladas Suiza and they were delicious.  The sauce on them was perfectly garlicy.
The only thing is that the restaurant is located in the same center as the Regal Cinemas but across the parking lot.  It is a little difficult to see in the shopping center, but it has a big red umbrella in front of it.  They are located in the southwest corner of the center.  I can hardly wait to go back!
