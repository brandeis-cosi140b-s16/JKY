Very good carne asada tacos. I went on may 5th to  celabrate the  Mexican holiday. The whole 2 line thing is a little weird,but the staff was very helpful. I can't wait to go back and try the spicy pork tacos.
***update-I went back a few days later and tried the spicy pork tacos .They were awesome I can't stop thinking about them. I could eat them all day every day .I have a new addiction and my body craves them.
