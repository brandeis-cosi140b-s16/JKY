We came to El Dorado Cantina looking for some delicious Mexican food, and that's exactly what we found. 

I was a little worried as we arrived, since the parking lot is shared with a gentleman's club. One inside the ambiance was wonderful. Our server was quick to greet us and brought some hot chips and a few different salsas. 

We started with a chicken gordita appetizer. The chicken was so flavorful, I almost didn't notice the amazing corn pocket that it was tucked in. The chicken enchiladas were similarly amazing, with some of the best black beans I've ever had. The Al Pastor street tacos  here just the right balance of tender pork and sweet pineapple. 

Overall this is a wonderful restaurant that I can't wait to visit again!
