I love this place. Their food is delicious. FRICASE DE POLLO CON PAPAS A LA HAVANERA is my favorite dish. I also like their cuban sandwich. Their rice is also very good. I like their banana chips too. On the weekends before, they had live band performing and salsa dancing at night time. The service is friendly and atmosphere is nice too. It's now 30% off at lunch time.
