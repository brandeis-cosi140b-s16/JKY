Everyone is crazy this food is for sure New Mexico food it is not mexican food.
New Mexico is a state and do not get me wrong I love Mexican food but I also love New Mexico food there chile verde and chile rojo is the best chilie ever! Yes you can get enchiladas and fajitas and I had a Chimichunga my husband had the green chile stew. Yes it takes a bit for your food but it is fresh! Ray served us he was awesome! So for those of you that are giving bad ratings you do not know New Mexico food for those of you that want to try it you have to go!
