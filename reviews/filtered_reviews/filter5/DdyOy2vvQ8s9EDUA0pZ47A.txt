The negative reviews on here are bogus.  Just because it take you longer than 10 min to get your food doesn't warrant giving it a low rating.  The meat is cooked fresh throughout the day, and if the carne asada is all gone at the moment and they have to cook more, don't you think that's a good sign?  People obviously love it enough for it to be sold out right then.  

Personally the food is amazing, definitely one of the best Mexican take-out in town.  Much better than all those ...berto's fast food restaurants!  And the price is lower than comparable places.  I'm always greeted with friendly service.  I tell all my friends and family to try Julia's because I love the food and want it to stay around.  

Try to the green chili pork burrito enchilada style, AMAZING!
