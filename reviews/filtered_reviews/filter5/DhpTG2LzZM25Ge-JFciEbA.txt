My husband decided to take us out for lunch and he picked Aunt Chiladas. The decor is so cute right when you walk in, very cheerful. We went for lunch so it was quieter. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. Now the best part....the chips! They were delicious, some of the best chips I've ever tasted. They weren't greasy or over-salted, but so good. I had the machaca taco salad which wasn't served in a taco shell so took away some of the guilt from eating all those chips. It had a scoop of their guacamole in it which was also delicious and creamy. My husband and son had the beef and cheese enchiladas which were served in a delicious red sauce. The regular side is a pasta called fideo, but they opted for the traditional rice and beans. I loved the food, the atmosphere and the service was good too. Definitely coming again.
