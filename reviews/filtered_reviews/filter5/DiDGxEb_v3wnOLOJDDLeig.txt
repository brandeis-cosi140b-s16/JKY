I'm partial to this place... I will admit this immediately. They come from my home state and know New Mexico chile and how it should be prepared. Chile rellenos, chile colorado, tacos and enchilads I've had them all. GOOD HOMESTYLE (Mexican homestyle) food. DO NOT forget to top your meal off with their homemade sopaipillas & honey. Never a complete dinner unless you have some.
