My wife and I went to The Mission tonight with some friends during our trip to Scottsdale, AZ, and we loved it! We ordered a sampling of nearly everything on the menu, and everything we ordered was wonderful.  

Some of our favorite dishes were - guacamole made at the table (medium spice), short rib tacos, mahi mahi tacos, pork belly appetizer, and bread pudding.

I had the avocado margarita and was pleasantly surprised that it was a really good margarita.  One of our friends ordered one of the tequila flights, and he said it was the best value he'd ever seen - 4 very nice samplings of tequila and great quality for a great price.

The decor was nice, and we were especially taken by the wall of Himalayan salt bricks.  It really is a sight to see with the lighting behind the bricks shining through. The one negative was that we were at a table with a HUGE painting sticking out from the wall that was a little intrusive, but it didn't ruin our meal by any means.

If you're ever in old town Scottsdale, I recommend you go to The Mission.  It's a good picture taking opportunity too with the mission building next door.
