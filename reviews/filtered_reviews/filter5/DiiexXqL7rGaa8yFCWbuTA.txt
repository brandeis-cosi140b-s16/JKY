This place is awesome. Came here on it's first day and, although it needs a few minor changes, it is my new favorite Mexican place! We are friends with the owners, and eat at their other restaurant, Stone and Vine, frequently. I recommend getting the pineapple salsa, which was out favorite one. DEFINITELY will return to enjoy the food, service, and atmosphere.
