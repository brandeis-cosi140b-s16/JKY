I did some research before my day business trip to Phoenix, and Barrio was the target lunch destination. The "tattooed" exterior is really cool, and great signage to find Barrio.

I had the tacos de cochinita de pebil with french fries, and I must tell you; Wowwaweewa! The pork was flavortown, and it was "the. most. tender. meat. I have ever eaten." The tortilla held the contents, but ripped tenderly when bit.

The ketchup for the fries was so good, and very unique; it was spicy.

The churros dessert was amazing.
