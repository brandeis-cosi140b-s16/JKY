A group of us went to Senor Frogs late on Saturday night.  It's a high energy, friendly place to have drinks and dance.  The bartenders serve up great margaritas and are fast to take your order.  The manager. Francisco, checked in with us three or four times to make sure we were having a good time.  He was so friendly and genuinely concerned about us.  We never felt so welcome (with A+ Personalized Service) in such lively place.  Would recommend it to locals and out-of-town visitors.
