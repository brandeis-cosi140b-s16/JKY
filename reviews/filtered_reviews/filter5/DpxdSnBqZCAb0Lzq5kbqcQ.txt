This place rocks! All of the food is awesome from the chicken tacos to the Carne asada quesadilla. The Birria tacos are second to none and the salsa bar is awesome with fresh salsa, guacamole,  and pickled onions that I have dreams about. If you are in the area try this place out it will not let you down, be warned they can get busy fast and they are a small restaurant. But I promise they are worth the wait.
