Our first time at Rio Mirage Cafe was totally awesome. We were with a group of eleven guests which didn't lessen the service, quality of food, and fun. The entire staff was on their game from when we first arrived and until we paid our checks. This included helping our group to celebrate a special occasion with important help from the staff. Everyone's drink (adult and non) and meal (wide selection of orders) was exactly as ordered and very delicious. We will be back. Sincerely, Karen & Art Huseonica, Sun City, AZ
