We're from SF and eat out a lot and I have to say that Amanda is one of the best servers we've ever had.  The complimentary Fideo soup is fantastic.  Amazing bean deal comes free with chip as well as sautéed onions and jalapeños for the chips.  We had fajitas and chile relleno it was all excellent.  They even set the fajitas on fire at the table.
