The first thing I want you to know about this place is that my eighty-six year old grandmother-in-law gave it her stamp of approval and said that we are coming back.  I don't know if it was the two margaritas she had that led to this remark, but the rest of the table agreed.  Happy hour works well if you order too much food and don't want to feel guilty about it.  Yeah, I'm a guy and am talking about paying for food that I was eating after I was full because I ordered it.  Isn't that an obligation if you want to remain a man?  The wait staff put up with my family with a smile.  Who knows?  The hidden gem on the menu was the cup of corn.  I wish I would have ordered it instead of a round of chicken tacos after having had the ribs and fish tacos.  I just have trouble ordering items with no meat.  The margaritas are highly recommended.  The Paloma was especially good.
