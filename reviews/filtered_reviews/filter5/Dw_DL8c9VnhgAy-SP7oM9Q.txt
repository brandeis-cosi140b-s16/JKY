great food (have the cranberry Margarita and carne asada tacos), great service and wonderful all around experience. we had a long wait due to a surprise rain shower which moved those dining outside in and they did all they could to get us to a table plus the host brought us delicious guacamole for our troubles and the manager stopped by to personally apologize and thanks us. our server was perfect and the decor was darling. we will definitely be back - even with the 40 minute drive to get there. one of my favorite mexican places ever.
