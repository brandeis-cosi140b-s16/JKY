MMMMMMMMM EFFING BULGOGI FRIES FOR THE WIN ONE OF THE BEST FRIES I'VE HAD IN VEGAS!!!

I've come here more than a handful of times and I've gotten their burritos, mongolian beef, and tacos. But none of that compares to the fries they serve. These fries taste like fries that food gods DREAM to eat. Ughhh, they're soooo cheesy you can never pick up just one fry, the cheese just drags more fries with it. It's that cheesy! And to set it off the jalapenos give that extra spicy bam in your mouth.

Parking is shouldn't be that bad, but the wait times are very unstable. Some nights its a 30 minute wait, other nights no wait.

Another plus is the service. If you do dine in it comes with some free chips and salsa, and an orange :)  . I usually haven't had a problem with long waits for food or refills.

If you're in the area definitely give this place a chance! You will not regret it! 

P.S. If you're in a rush call in advance and you can pick up the food!!!!
