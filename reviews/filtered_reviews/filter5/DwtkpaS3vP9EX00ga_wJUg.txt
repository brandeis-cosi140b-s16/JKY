I was VERY impressed with this restaurant. We went at about 6:30 on a Friday night and were seated promptly. I think we made perfect time because by the time we left a little over an hour later the place was packed and they had quite a few people waiting to be seated.

We started off with some chips and salsa, which unfortunately don't come free. To be fair they were an upgrade over your standard free chips since the multicolored chips were served with a variety of tasty salsas. I had the chicken enchiladas which were plated beautifully and tasted delicious. Seriously, they might have been the best enchiladas I've ever had. I also had a cocktail with vodka and watermelon juice which was delicious and was neither too sweet nor too strong. My boyfriend had some sort of pork dish (anijitos?) which he also really liked. 

The service was also prompt and non-intrusive. 

Overall, great food, good service, and good pricing, especially considering the prices of other places in Scottsdale. In fact, the pricing is what attracted us here in the first place - we didn't want to pay $25+ a plate every single night. We'll definitely be back on our next spring training excursion.
