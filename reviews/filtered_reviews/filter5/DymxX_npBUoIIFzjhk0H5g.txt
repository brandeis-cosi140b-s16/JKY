Killer dining. Just awesome. We had the Duck Carnitas Empanada, the Braised Shortrib, and the Chorizo Porchetta. Wow. 

Also, absolutely stellar service by a gentleman whose name I cannot recall, but who wears glasses, has short black hair, and manages part time. 

This is such a great restaurant, so glad they are doing well. There are a lot of substandard Mexican/Latin restaurants in the Phoenix area. But The Mission is so good.  Highly recommend.
