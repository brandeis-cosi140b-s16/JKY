True fact. Since I discovered Cafe Rio, probably 95% of the burritos I've eaten have come from here.

They make Mission-style burritos here, with savory beans, cilantro lime rice (that is inexplicably beige), sauce and cheese on the inside along with your meat of choice, and lettuce and pico next to it in an aluminum tray. I almost always get the shredded, braised chicken and the hot red sauce. Unlike Chipotle's rubbery, greasy meat, the chicken and roast chile beef here are flavorful without overpowering the other flavors in the burrito. The aroma of the red sauce is intoxicating.

They run the burritos through a conveyor oven and then add veggies - a "why didn't anyone think of it sooner" innovation that keeps hot stuff hot and cold stuff cold. Hey, remember the McDLT? Nah, me neither.

Though the salsa fresca served here isn't anything special, their "wall of flame" covered in hot sauces is a great way to add heat and flavor.

Honestly? The best part of this burrito is the tortilla. Made fresh moments before you order, it's dense and mild and almost more reminiscent of a naan in some bites.

Service is generally very good here, and the staff definitely seems to have a cordial rapport with their guests. Some of the quirky chants I could do without, but it makes the place livelier than your usual burrito assembly line.

Me gusta.
