I've heard so much about Korean and Mexican fusion so when I saw this restaurant on Yelp I had to try it out. They make the food as it's ordered so plan on spending some time here, especially if it's busy. It is worth the wait. I ordered the tostada with bulgogi meat. The meat was tender and the marinade was delicious. It reminded me of my mother's tapa- Filipino- except that it was sliced thinner. It was served on top of a rice patty, a patty with some crispy rice on the outside. Topped with cabbage and salsa this meal tasted so fresh. I can't wait to go back to try their other specialties!
