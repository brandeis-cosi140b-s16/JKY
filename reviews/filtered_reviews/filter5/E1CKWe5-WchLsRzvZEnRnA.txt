I have these as the best tacos in the country (and I've eaten the top-rated tacos in Chicago, and Phoenix). I went here on the Yelp reviews a year back, and have been going back whenever passing through Madison craving tacos. The bar seating and liquor license give it extra points, and the location is actually a plus (some say not-so-nice area, I say plenty of parking). Yes, bizarre that these are some of the best tacos are in the country, but that's just the way it is.
