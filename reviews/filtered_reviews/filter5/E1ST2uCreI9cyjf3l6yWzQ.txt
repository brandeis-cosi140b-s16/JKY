This place it legit! A clear leap ahead of any other drive thru/ fast Mexican food place, of which I drive by several just to get here. And I've never regretted it.

I am usually the only white/non-Spanish speaking person in the place when I go and that's a good thing. It seems to be a go to spot for local Hispanic families and workers who usually know best when it comes to these sorts of things. 

Some of the best burritos and tacos anywhere. Everything is good and the salsa bar inside is nice.
