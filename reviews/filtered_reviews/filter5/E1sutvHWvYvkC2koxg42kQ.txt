Don't see many positives about the hostesses when I read these reviews but I am
confused why because of all of the wonderful experiences I've had at the Cave Creek location. The hostesses are hard working young girls that deserve a little more credit then all is given to them. They seem to work hard at what they do and although some messing around is going on; let's all be honest with each other, they are just kids! I come in often; Fridays and Saturdays and always see the same girls, Miana and Tabitha working very hard on the take out side of the stand. Very very sweet girls who are personable and kind, always going through my order and making sure I have what I need! Much better service I get from all these ladies then previous years. Servers are wonderful and food is outstanding! Valle Luna Cave Creek is a great place for family and friends, dine in or take out!
