The food here is amazing! And the staff is incredible. It's owned & run by a family and they always go out of their way to make sure your experience is enjoyable. It's hard to find really good Mexican food in Phoenix (especially in Glendale), but this place always delivers great food at good prices and it comes with unlimited free chips & (delicious) salsa!
