Recently some of my colleagues from Spain were visiting and on their last night in town, I offered to take them to dinner.   They immediately told me that they NEEDED to have authentic Mexican food and they really wanted tacos.   After searching through pages and pages of Yelp and Google, and polling my friends on facebook...I finally chose La Condesa over many strong recommendations of Los Dos Molinos, Barrio Cafe, Aunt Chiladas, and many more....   Now, I realized that never having been there myself before I was taking a bit of a risk...but my fellow Yelpers surely couldn't lead me astray, right?!   

Happily, they did not!   The food was delicious.  The four of us all ordered different kinds of tacos and we all loved our dishes!  I had the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, which I DEFINITELY recommend!  The flavor was amazing! a little heat, a little citrusy....mmm mmm mmm!!   Two of my co-workers had the Carne Asada and they both raved about it the whole way home. we all shared an Horchata for dessert -- wow!  very good too!  It's a big drink, so I do recommend sharing - it's totally worth it!    Their bellies were content before the long flight back to Espana!   

The portions were good.  Not too big, not too small.  Two tacos were filling - I always like to know what to expect.  Nobody had any leftovers, so I think the portions were just right.  

Of course, the salsa bar is a key feature of this place.  I think we only made it through 5 or 6 kinds and I liked them all.   The mango one was one of my favorites, which is a surprise b/c I'm not usually a huge fan, but I loved the sweet and spicy combo - it was done just right.   

I've already sent the link to my foodie brother in law - the whole fam will be visiting for the holidays, we will definitely be going back!   This will be a MUST visit place for my future recommendations!  

Yeah!
