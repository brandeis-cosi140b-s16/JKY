I saw the place last time we went to downtown with my wife and made a mental note to return and try it out. Glad we did because we were not disappointed. The decor reminds us of an old mexican fishing restaurant, with nice details as to the paintings on the tables and group seating. The music was good selection, a tad loud.

The waitress, Tanya, was very helpful in helping us navigate the menu, the Tamarindo Margarita was perfect, not too sweet and refreshing, the Pescado a la Plancha, was moist and the Veracruz salsa with it, balanced and  good combination of flavors. We will be back with friends.
