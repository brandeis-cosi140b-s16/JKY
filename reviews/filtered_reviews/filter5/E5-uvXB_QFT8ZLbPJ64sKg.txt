SUPER FAST service. We only had 45 minutes to eat and were in and out of there in just over a half an hour. Shrimp fajitas - perfectly seasoned, large shrimp. The onions and peppers had a good char on them and were still sizzling when they got to me. The refried beans were flavorful. The house salsa is chunky and fresh and the waitress kept it coming. Good happy hour drinks and prices as well.
