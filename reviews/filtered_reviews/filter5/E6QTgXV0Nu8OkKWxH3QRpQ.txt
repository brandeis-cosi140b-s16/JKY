We were so excited to have the guy from Tacos Atoyac open a restaurant in a location that is more convenient to us. The fish tacos and burritos are of course amazing. My husband who supposedly doesn't like fish tacos even thinks they are good. I also like anything with the chorizo, and the Pastor is very tasty. We have only gotten take out so far, but it has been fast and affordable.
