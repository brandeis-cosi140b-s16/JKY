I went here on the 4th of July, which was an extremely busy night. Most of the restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale were closed for the holiday, but luckily we found this gem. Ordinarily we wouldn't have been able to get seated quickly without a reservation, but they had a table for two opened up that they said was reserved in an hour and a half, which is plenty enough for dinner. 

The service was great and quick. We got the tableside guacamole to start, which was prepared right in front of us! Our main course arrived about 30 seconds after the guacamole was finished, which was strange, but we didn't complain. We got the pork shoulder tacos which comes with corn tortillas on a salt block. I found this a really interesting concept. You would just rub the tortilla on the block and the salt would transfer. The pork was so juicy and the sweet sauce that came with it was divine. We ordered the Guatemalan chocolate pastilla, which was probably the most unpleasant part of the meal, even though it tasted fine. It sort of looked like poop, which was unnerving. Lol. But the rest of the food was amazing, and I definitely would recommend this place. Pricey, but worth it.
