Good, consistent fare, and always fresh. We always get take out, and there is never a problem when we get hone and rip into the boxes of carefully wrapped, individual containers.

It's not always an easy request for EXTRA pico digallo, but well worth the humiliating begging we must go through to get a few ounces more! Great for the kiddos, too!

The margs are great, if ya wanna wait in the place and forget they take phone orders, or last minute "honey, will you bring home dinner tonight?"
