Hungry for a grilled chicken salad on a Friday night and stumbled onto this place through Yelp. Phoned in the order and had great customer service. I ordered the Supreme salad with grilled chicken and asked if they had Chipotle Ranch dressing to go with it. She said no, but we can make it. Very accommodating and the food was delicious!  The home made chipotle ranch was the bomb! Overall excellent food and service. I'll be going back before I leave Vegas!
