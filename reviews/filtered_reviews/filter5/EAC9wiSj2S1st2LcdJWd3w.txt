Sweet spot! Very cool ambiance. Food was great. Salsa bar was delicious. Pecan salsa was amazing. Never would have thought of and almost did not try, but was the best of the batch. Would have liked a little more spice, but all were good. Shark taco, colors of the flag burrito was stunning. Another combo (meat, raisins, and apples) that was great. Quesadilla was also great. Not the standard quesadilla but better in my opinion. Small with only 10 tables, and things were a bit slow but more than worth it!!
