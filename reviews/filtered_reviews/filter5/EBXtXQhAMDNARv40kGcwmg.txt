Best taco shop in Phoenix, period!! This place is not just your average Mexican/American aka Macayo's approach to mediocre Mexican food.  This place is as grass roots as you can get! Home grown from the state of Oaxaca Mexico. Translation for those saying Chewbacca, this is not your Star Wars flick but it is a very rich and notable region of Mexico that produces some amazing cheeses that also somehow motivated a few cats to open up their own taco shop next to a tire shop in Phoenix!  

Try everything in their menu, it is delicious! Don't let their location fool you, these guys care about great ingredients like their organic veggies and home local baked tortillas!  

I have had them do catering too, the price is ridiculously low and they are just awesome at what they do.. I will forgive them for being closed Sunday and Monday because great talents do need to rest.  Remember if you want Macayos or greasy lard infested plates don't come here, there owner will tell you the same because they care about what they do, BOSS status!
