I have been here twice now..and both times it was delish! The first go around I got the Carne Quesadilla and today I got the Carne Burrito. Both were excellent. Their meat is SO much better then many other chain fast food Mexican places because they actually cook it on what appears to be a very large grill! Their regular sized burritos are not huge but that is fine with me because I will pay for quality over quantity anyday. I will keep going back :)
