We came here on a yelp recommendation and were not disappointed.  If you are looking for haute cuisine, this is not your place, but if you love authentic and inexpensive Mexican food, look no further. 

We ate here twice about 10 days apart, and the second time we came were were thrilled to find that the back room with additional seating was finished being built.  We didn't have to wait for a table.  Although we liked the new spacious area, I have to admit that there is some charm in eating at the bar and watching all of the food being made.
