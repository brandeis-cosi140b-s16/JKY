I came to Az thinking I knew great Mexican food, and found that one has to hunt for the good stuff. We found the Barrio when it was 6 months old and it is still one of my top 3 restaurants in Az. People who blanch at the price are used to the family-style overly cheesy, milder Sonoran style food. Mexico's different regions represent much more complex and varied flavors than that, and the owner has studied and raised Mexican food to an art form.
NOTE: someone called this "Tex-Mex" and I am fairly certain the owner/chef would be greatly insulted at the term. Tex-Mex is NOT Mexican food! It is a style bastardized for Anglo tastes and is not authentic to any region of Mexico.
