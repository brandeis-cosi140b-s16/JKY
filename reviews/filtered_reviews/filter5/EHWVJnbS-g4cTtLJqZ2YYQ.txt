So good, so good!  Best meal I've had in a long time.  Had an early lunch on Saturday at the Border Grill.  I was starving and turned to Yelp for suggestions.  The restaurant wasn't busy when I arrived and I was greeted by my friendly server Alex.  We chatted a bit before he took my order.  I said, "I'll have the shrimp tacos."  He replied, "no, no you won't, you'll have the chicken pablano enchiladas."  Ummm, okay, I'm easy.  Good suggestion, this dish was amazing.  Fresh chips and three different salsas were brought to the table and they were really good too.

When a restaurant is that good you have to have dessert, right?  I ordered the flan and it too was great.  It was wearing a lovely halo of candied sugar.  Hard to describe but really interesting and creative.  I took a photo but it doesn't do it justice.

Will definitely return.  Saw some people eating a small plates brunch and that looked good so might have to try that next time.

Look out Alex, I will be back soon.

F.Y.I the restaurant is in the Forum Shoppes, lower level by the spiral elevator.  People kept telling me lower level, but darn I couldn't find any evidence of a lower level coming in from the casino.
