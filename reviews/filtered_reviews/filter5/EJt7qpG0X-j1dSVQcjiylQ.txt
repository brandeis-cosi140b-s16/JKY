The Barbacoa Pork burritos are awesome. I'm a big dude and just one will keep me full for a long time. While it is not a "traditional" Mexican place, the food is outstanding and they have a unique flavor. I swear they put estrogen in the food for the women folk... almost every single girl I know loves the taste of their salads and food. Even when it is busy it is normally fast to get your food, and there is always a place to sit. The best part about Cafe Rio is that they are consistently good.
