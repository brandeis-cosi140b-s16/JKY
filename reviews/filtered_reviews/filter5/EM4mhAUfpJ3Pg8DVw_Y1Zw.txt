What an unexpected and wonderful restaurant! I adore Mexican food but often ache for a fresh twist on the traditional fare. Taco Haus delivered exactly that. 

My wife and ordered salmon ceviche and a whitetail ceviche special. Our friends had the El Pastor and rotisserie chicken tacos. We had a side of roasted corn. The dishes all cleverly incorporated Spanish elements one might expect at a tapas restaurant--lentils, roasted sweet peppers, goat cheese and the like. And yet it was all wonderful Mexican fare. 

Oh, we had two six-year-old girls with us. They had simple fare like shrimp tacos and a cheese quesadilla. They loved it. 

I never order dessert at Mexican restaurants but we decided to give Taco Haus' a try. Wow. Flan rich as caramel, and a sponge cake in a sweet cream sauce. 

The service was friendly, even though the place was packed. And the beer selection included Bell's Oberon--a summer favorite of mine from Chicago that is fairly uncommon here in Scottsdale. 

This strip mall at the corner of Shea and Scottsdale roads is becoming a hot spot for good casual restaurants. Taco Haus is a great addition to the scene.
