My husband and I were visiting for a convention and I decided to get the groupon just as an excuse to get away from the strip. We are from San Diego and we have pretty good Mexican food in SD, but Abuela's totally topped anything we have ever had! The hand made tortillas were so fresh and had amazing flavor. We had the carne asada, fish and shrimp tacos. The fish was good, but that is the only one I would say San Diego has anyone beat on. The meals were not overly salty, all the ingredients went together so well, we are very impressed. A day later we were craving Abuela's tacos again, but this time I had one of each flavor to go. oh my talk about deeeelicious, and The barbacoa was AMAZING! We ended up going back one more time for our drive back, for total of three visits in our six day stay. We are definitely going to have Abuela's on our list when we come back. Mary was so nice and made us feel at home. All three times I did not find the restaurant to be in a dangerous area, maybe just a little bit of an older neighborhood, especially if you compare it to the strip.
