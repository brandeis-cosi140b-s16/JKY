I don't review much on yelp. I'll preface my review by saying that I am Cuban and grew up with my grandmother making carnitas and flan. I also have family in Miami, and when I visit we always hit the best Cuban restaurants. All that being said my meal @ El Dorado was one of the top 3 Mexican/Cuban meals that I have ever had. The carne asada tacos and the burrito were simply incredible. And the Flan. Oh my god the Flan. The Flan was the best thing I ate in Vegas this trip. Better than anything I had at delmonico and joes seafood and steak - which are no slouches. Eat here, you won't be disappointed!  And for the love of god get the Flan!  :)
