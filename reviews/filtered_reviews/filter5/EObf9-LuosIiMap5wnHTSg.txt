Great Mexican food The Best in Las Vegas.
The Chef and Wait staff are equal to none and by far the best in Las Vegas. Most of them have worked together for  many years for an established Mexican restaurant that suddenly closed about a year or so ago . The Chef has been doing his thing here in LV for many years and is one of the best. Juan's has everything going for it including some of  the best food salsa and Margaritas north of the boarder. This is also a Dallas Cowboys bar and has great deals on appetizers on game days and nights. Juan's is a great addition to the Mexican restaurant scene in LV. It also has a very comfortable bar and patio area.
Thanks Juan.
