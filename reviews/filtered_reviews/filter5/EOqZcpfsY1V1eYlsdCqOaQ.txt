Mexico authentico! This is a real mexican restaurant. No gringo bullshit with sombrero statues and pictures of texan missions. Just plain old excellent mexican food. They don't drown your food in salsa, because the food is good. You could certainly put the salsa on your food, it doesn't belong there though...it belongs on your chips! Which they make there.

The Clare Burro is phenomenal, I have also had the chimichanga and enchiladas, but return for the Clare most often. Its got whole beans! So good...

Not only that, but Restaurant Mexico has been in business for over 25 years, has survived numerous losses of physical building location, something that has killed so many other businesses. Impressive, because of its impressive food!
