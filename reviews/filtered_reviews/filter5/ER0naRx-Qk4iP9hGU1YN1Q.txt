This place is not like most Mexican restaurants. Las Cazuelas specializes in Mexican cuisine from the Puebla region. Having grown up eating comida poblana (food from Puebla) almost on a daily basis, I can proudly say this is the closest to authentic Puebla cuisine you'll find in Las Vegas. Last time I was there I tried Enchiladas de Mole Poblana and I was thoroughly impressed! Check this place out folks!
