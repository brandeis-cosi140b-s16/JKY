I would give more stars if possible - GREAT FOOD, FRIENDLY STAFF and FAIR PRICE. We recently moved to Phoenix and are always looking for new places to try. In our way to another Mexican place in Cave Creek we checked YELP and decide to drive up to Anthem and try Robertos and I'm so happy we did. We had the Carne Assada Torta, a Carne Assada Burrito, a carne assada quesadilla (I guess thats a giveaway we really like carne assada) and  Chips with cheese and guacamole. They were all delicious. Planty of carne assada in all dishes. Meat tasted fresh and not overly seasoned. Almost more carne assada then cheese in the quesadilla. The salsa that came with the dishes was really fresh and tasty  (and they offered extra salsa at least twice - no charge). Lots of guacamole on the chips and cheese too. Everything was so delicious. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. When we were leaving they told us about the tamales and we will stop there again for sure to try them
