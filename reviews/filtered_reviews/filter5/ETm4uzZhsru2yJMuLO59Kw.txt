Rokerij is my favorite restaurant in this part of town.

Everything i have tried has been quite enjoyable and the service is generally quite good. It does fill up at times so I recommend planning ahead for this.

The basement area is fun but I enjoy the atmosphere in the entire restaurant. The price is very reasonable given the quality of the food.

I can easily recommend Rokerij and find that it is a great value and dining experience.
