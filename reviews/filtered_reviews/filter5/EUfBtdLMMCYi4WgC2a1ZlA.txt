They seem to have changed the name of this place, at least on the signage out front, so we were confused at first. But if you go to the address listed, it's the same place.

Very easy--just choose your taco meat from a menu (fillings are ranked in order of spiciness), toppings, and you're good to go! Spicy means SPICY--even the barely-spicy items were a lot for me to handle. I had one chicken, one pork, and one beef taco, and all were amazing (they even cooked up the beef on the stovetop for me right after I ordered). I wish I lived in Phoenix so I could return!
