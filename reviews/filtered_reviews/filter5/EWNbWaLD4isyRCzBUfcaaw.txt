Food was wonderful and the staff was very accommodating. Meals have big portions, best Spanish rice I've ever had, and the enchilada sauce was very good! Margaritas are nice and strong as well.

You can tell that this restaurant is well-managed, they go out of their way to make things right for the customer.
