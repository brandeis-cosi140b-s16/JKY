So it's easy for me to review this place, because I only came here for one thing: a drink. The bartender was sweet, chatted us up, and made us a marvelous mojito to start off our afternoon. We even got a free shot of cacha√ßa when we asked about it! Can't speak for the food, but hey, when a venue meets your needs and exceeds expectations, it's an easy recommendation to make!
