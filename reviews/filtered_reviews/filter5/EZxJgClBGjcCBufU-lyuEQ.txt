I've literally eaten here 4 times this week.

It's a little expensive, ($22 for 5 enchiladas, an egg and two drinks), which is why I am stuck on giving it less than 5 stars. But otherwise, I think it could be worth the money considering how unique and customizable it is. I don't know, I just want everything to be free, so I'm at like 4.5 stars on this one...

Anyway, the food tastes great. Really unique, authentic options. I really recommend the red sauce, corn tortillas, pork, chicken, an over-medium egg, slaw, jalapeno ranch and cotija cheese...that's what I ALWAYS get. They have really good chips and salsa, too.

The staff is friendly. My only complaint is that there are SO many options, that I think they could benefit from having labels on the glass telling you what everything is, that way you don't have to stare straight up and get lost on the menu and waste their time, but they do a good job of explaining it anyway. Still, I like doing things myself instead of asking the same dumb question every time. 

They serve in their own little wood-fired ceramic bowls which is cute and unique, too.

They said they don't like hearing "this is kinda like Chipotle!" so I will say this place is better than Chipotle, but very similar :)

They serve enchiladas, chopped salads, stuffed poblano peppers and have other specials. 

Take all of my money, Gadzooks. You are so yummy.
