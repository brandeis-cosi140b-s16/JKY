We've always had GREAT service here - the wait staff is extremely child-friendly. Our waiter the other night brought our daugter a cup of water with a pink umbrella in it and told her he made it special for her because she's a special little girl. Unbelievable! You just don't get that anymore in restaurants!

Anyway - we were seated immediately upon entering on a Friday night. Surprised the place wasn't more packed than it was... we've been here before and love their food. 

Salsa was immediately brought to our table and we're big fans of their salsa. Simple, flavorful and authentic. 

I almost always order the small Norteno Torta - I adore the flavor and texture combinations and their bolillo bread is so soft and fluffy and flavorful!

My little girl ordered the hamburguesa (or as she calls it, a hang-gubber). We each managed to sneak a bite of it - and it's a mighty fine burger indeed! I may one day try just a burger!

My husband asked our water to "go authentic" on him - he left his choice up to the waiter and our waiter did NOT disappoint. A plate full of seasoned beef, some nopales, rice and beans and fresh tortillas. He loved it. 

Big fans - we'll go back again and again!
