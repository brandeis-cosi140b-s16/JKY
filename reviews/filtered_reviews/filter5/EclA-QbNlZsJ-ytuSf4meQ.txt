Came here once with my friends and will definitely come back for more. The tacos are amazing and my favorite is fried chicken quesadilla. Their salsas are delicious and spicy enough for my taste. The place is quite small, so we just ordered take out. And the price is quite certainly right for the quality food they're serving here.
