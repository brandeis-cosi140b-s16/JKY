Yum yum yum is all I can say! We drove right by it twice before we realized where it was but don't be discouraged based upon the exterior! The rave reviews of food network and guide books do it justice. The service was excellent! Speedy quick! My drinks were constantly being refilled, my plate was swooped away within a minute of finishing. Our waiter warned us that many people are caught of guard by the mole sauce. He recommended we try it before ordering. He brought us some out and glad he did, mole isn't for everyone. With that new knowledge we all order tacos. Carne asada and fish. They were three street style  tacos. Very very good. Fresh avocado on top makes me want to put it on everything! Overall, a great experience and fantastic food!
