Fresh quality, ingredients. Friendly staff.
I've come twice and haven't been disappointed. Came as a family both times, brought a friend the second time. Dinner time wasn't too busy, but still lively. Lunch is great.
I am a fan of an open burrito. My husband does a wet burrito. Kids do quesadillas.
Fresh guacamole and chips made in house.
