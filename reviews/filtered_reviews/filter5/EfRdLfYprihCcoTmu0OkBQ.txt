Owners Dennis and Liz Sirrine are old-time friends of my parents. Not good enough friends that I get free food I must add. But it's great to see folks I know do so well. The little labor of love that was their first restaurant -- the famed Rosas --  has evolved into the fabulous Rancho de Tia Rosas.

"Where Mexican Food is a Work of Art" claims Tia Rosa.  The Enchiladas Monterey with it's vibrant colors of the Mexican flag could be a Piccasso and the slightly-sweet, nutty Chicken Mole might be a Van Gogh. Thank goodness this art is edible!

There is a take out store in front and an amazing patio. Try to visit soon before it gets too hot to sit outside, and come early or make reservations; it's almost always packed.
