I've been here a few times and every time I come, the food is delicious and fresh. The staff is friendly and their selection of aguas frescas is amazing. The food is just as appealing to the eye as it is to the taste buds. 

Not much else to say other than if all you're used to is Roberto's, take a step into the light and you will be pleasently surprised.
