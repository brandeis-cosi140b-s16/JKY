On point!... I always start off with the "Al Pastor" (marinated pork) tacos. Then get chorizo and finish off with asada tacos. Don't forget to ask for their grilled onions n peppers. Also ask for a couple tostadas to scrape off d the meat that falls off the tacos. And to wash it all down a large  ice cold Jamaica.
Everything is good from taste, location and price.
