LOVE this place! I have had Taco Y Taco bookmarked for quite a while and finally had time to go today for lunch. It was not crowded at all and after telling the cashier it was our first time she was happy to explain how the ordering worked. I knew I wanted the al pastor (roasted pork) after reading all of the great reviews. As others have mentioned it is sliced right in front of you on a spit, just like gyro meat.  

Stepping up to to the line #2 I was greeted by two very friendly employees. I ordered 2 gran tacos al pastor. The gran tacos come with 2 soft corn tortillas that have melted monterey jack cheese between them, then the al pastor, black beans, pico, avocado and sour cream. Aboslutely delicious! It was definately one of the best tacos I have ever eaten.

We also ordered a side of chips and guac which at $3.75 was a steal. These are real chips, you can tell made in house and guac was delicious. While waiting for our food we hit the amazing salsa bar. It has everything you can imagine! 8 different salsa's, fresh limes, radishes, pickled carrots and peppers and grilled onions & peppers. The grilled onions were so sweet and yummy. 

The staff were all very friendly and helpful. I even got a "thank you" when I put a tip in the tip jar which is nice. I am definately returning to try the mole fries and the grilled cactus. Thank you Taco Y Taco for a great lunch!
