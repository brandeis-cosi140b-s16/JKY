Best green chili I've had since I was in Colorado. Busy as heck on a Sunday morning but so worth the wait. friendly service and great prices.

I had the huevos rancheros and they were kind enough to smother the hash browns with the green chili the same way I'm used to having it in Colorado. Definitely will be back. 5 stars. Can't miss!! The best in town!
