YES! Just YES!!! Finally, after much disappointment in Charlotte,  this west-coast girl found a good hand-held burrito. Not only that, but it's a "fast-food" burrito that knows how to cook tofu! I ordered just a basic bean, cheese, and rice. My husband ordered the tofu burrito with red beans. They were both amazing. Full of flavor, and unique. The tofu was cooked well, firm, with lots of flavor. The rice was well cooked with a light cilantro flavor. The beans and rice are all vegetarian friendly. The tortillas were soft and flakey. Overall this place was amazing. Definitely comparable to some burrito places I've been to in San-Diego. 

My only complaint is the fact that none of the salsas in the salsa bar are spicy. However; they were each amazingly unique and added a great flavor to the already amazing burritos.
