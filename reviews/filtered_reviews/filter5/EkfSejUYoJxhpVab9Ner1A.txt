Great food and excellent service make this a no-brainer when your in the mood for Mexican. I had the Spooning Relleno which was one of the best Mexican dishes I've ever had. My girlfriend had a similar experience with the Stacked Enchilada. Courteous staff made the experience one I'll repeat next time I drive through Phoenix.
