This place is all about Mexican comfort food. It reminds me of the places my parents used to go to when I was a kid. (I don't think the prices have changed since the 80s, either.) One really heartwarming thing: I sat down next to an older guy who shared his Wall Street Journal. He said that in the dark light he could only read the headlines.
