A great addition to the neighborhood!! It must be tough selling Mexican food in this area- lots of good places to go. But, Lucha is one of the best. The recipes are the families originals. The food is very authentic and plentiful. Flavors are amazing!! Previous reviews have touched on the meats, variety and options available, so I will save you the reading. All the quicker to get over there!!!  Go!! Runnn!
