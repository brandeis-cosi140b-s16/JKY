One word of advice: PINEAPPLE AGUA FRESCA w/TEQUILA

We came in Saturday around 7:15pm.  We loved the decor and friendly laid back vibe.  The restaurant has a really nice patio with comfy booths.  Glad they seated our party of two in a spacious spot!!

The salsa and Chips are really yummy and we got a salad and 3 tacos that were delicious.  The cucumber salad on the side was refreshing to counter the subtle spicy flavors in the tacos.  Of course the fish taco is amazing and the carne asada is pretty classic. Next time we go I want to try the guacamole and grilled corn appetizers.

The main thing I enjoyed was delicious pineapple agua fresca with tequila!!! My sweetie was responsible and barely tried his 1 margarita... I drank most of it because I truly love lime and sour (versus sweet) margaritas. We are just starting in on the refreshing cocktails they offer- I spied over 5 agua frescas that you can customize with alcohol and they offer which agua frescas go best with which liquors.

Too bad we didn't get dessert though I'm confident joyride is an addition to our regular date night spots.  I'm a big fan of any Arizona attempt for quality Mexican inspired food!!
