Just happened upon this place after an exhaustive day of tile shopping. The menu is small but has your basic wants with regards to fish tacos. Basically fish or shrimp or both. 

My tacos looked small but wound up being very filling. Even their fries are super tasty. I like the condiment bar with all the sauces and such. Service was fast and friendly. Would definitely go back!
