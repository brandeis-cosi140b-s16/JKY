We recently dined at this awesome restaurant located in the Aria casino. This is one cool place.
Service was beyond outstanding! The margaritas were fantastic, as were the chips and salsa.
I ordered the filet mignon and it came out a perfect medium. One of the best steaks I've had in a long time, as were the 2 large prawns and the white rice. We completed our meal with the delicious fried ice cream.
I highly recommend this restaurant.
