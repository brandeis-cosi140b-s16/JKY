We were in Phoenix for a Thanksgiving vacation - five of us, and everyone wanted Mexican. So we yelped a place for dinner and decided on Padres.  The food was great, the service as well - and it had a friendly and positive atmosphere as well.  The food is really excellent- more real mexican than American mexican - which is a good thing by my standards... It was reasonable, by Bay Area standards, anyway - and worthwhile.  If I go back to Phoenix I would definitely revisit!

Thanks for a great evening!
