Having left my packed lunch safely in the fridge at home (an event that happens far more often than I'd like to admit) I set off to try something new for lunch today. Fiesta Burrito was a great choice; thank you yelp!

I ordered the machaca plate, no. 11. A generous helping of machaca with egg, onions, peppers, cheese, and rice and beans on the side. A flour tortilla to scoop it all up with, some fresh pico de gallo and salsa verde from the salsa bar and I was set for a great lunch.

The food was great and inexpensive. The service was friendly and the location was very clean. 

They have a big menu with several combination plates, all with rice and beans, breakfast food served all day, and some great a la carte options if you don't want the full meal.

Compared to other drive-through/quick order Mexican food places around, my meal here was comparable to Carolina's. That's the highest praise I can think to give a place like this.

I'll definitely be back.
