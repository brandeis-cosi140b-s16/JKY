I have heard so many great things about this place & finally my boyfriend took me here earlier today. Very warm & friendly environment (which I loved!!). The food is 100% homemade & fresh. The employees were very nice & made it a fun experience.

I got one of their salads - OH MY GOD! So much food for me, but at least I got to bring the rest home! 

I can't believe it took me this long to try this place. Boy have I missed out. I will DEFINITELY be going back!!
