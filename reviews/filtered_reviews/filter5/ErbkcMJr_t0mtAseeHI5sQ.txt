Hard to find, but worth the effort! The only sign you'll see is "additional parking in the rear" above the door.  
Small, casual place; very intimate. Small wood burning grill adds a wonderful smell to the ambiance.
$5 dollar mimosa and bloody mary's for breakfast worth every penny.  Friendly attentive staff (bonus: even offered a beer chaser with the bloody-something you don't find very often outside of the Midwest).
I had Carne Adavado and my husband had the eggs Benedict. Everything was delish! Served on hot plates (kept our breakfast warm til we were finished).  Highly recommend.
Can't wait to go back!
