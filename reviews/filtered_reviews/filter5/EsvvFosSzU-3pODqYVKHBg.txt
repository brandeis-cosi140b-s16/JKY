Awesome and delicious $2 tacos. Blown away by the juiciness and flavors. Try their Beef tongue tostada and you will be in heaven!!! It's that good. They also have an all you can eat radish station :) pretty cool to munch on them to clear your palette in between tacos or just for a good old crunch... 

PS we paid more money for a cab to get there that for the actual food... But so worth it. So happy we tried it. Definitely coming there again.
