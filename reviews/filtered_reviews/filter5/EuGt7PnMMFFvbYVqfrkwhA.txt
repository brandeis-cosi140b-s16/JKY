Absolutely outstanding Tex-Mex joint with fantastic tacos and some of the best margaritas I've ever had. The Mole, Pastor and Pollo Rojo tacos were all delicious, as were the chips and salsa (which, incidentally, are NOT free). Our server was efficient and attentive, and the the roadhouse decor creates the perfect atmosphere for a casual date night, or an evening out with friends.

Parking is the only real downside to this location. You might get lucky enough to find street parking within walking distance, but I'd suggest using Bakersfield's convenient valet lot at the corner of Kenilworth and East Blvd. The $2 tip is well-worth avoiding the frustration of circling the block three times, like we did on our visit.

While this isn't the most kid-friendly Mexican restaurant in town, that can sometimes be a GOOD thing. So leave the little ones at home, and head over to Dilworth to enjoy one of the best taquerias in the Queen City.
