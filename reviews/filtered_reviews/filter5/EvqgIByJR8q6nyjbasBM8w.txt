I grew up near the original location, so I had to try this place out! Had bean burro and tostadas to share with children.  My child, who is a picky eater, loved them! Best bean burro in town! The family is the ones cooking and helping you, so they take make the effort to make your experience a good one. Try it and you won't be sorry!!!
