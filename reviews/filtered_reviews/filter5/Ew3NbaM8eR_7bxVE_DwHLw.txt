Got the norm of mole enchiladas,  they are a oaxacan staple,  sweet,  chocolatey deliciousness.  Don't expect spicy red northern Mexican mole,  this is different. This recipe has more than 30 ingredients,   5 of them are dried Chiles and none of them are for spice they are for flavor.  

Also had the pozole,  I was cold,  and it warmed me up,  it made me happy. It is sweater weather after all. 

Also shared the esquite with the husband.  It's Corn off the cob,  mixed with cotija cheese,  Mayo and crushed chili pepper. Yummy. 

Ok,  we also had  the sopes lol!!!  Chorizo and asada.  Deliciousness,  perfection. Must have.

By the way we're not fat,  I swear!
