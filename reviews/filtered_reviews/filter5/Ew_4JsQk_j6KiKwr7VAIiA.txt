Maize has the best Mexican food on campus hands down. Everything I have tried there has been nothing but delicious. The service is fast and friendly, the price is relatively inexpensive, and anything you order comes with chips and salsa, making it a great value! I would recommend ordering to go because of the small size of the restaurant. Would love to see these guys expand into a larger space!
