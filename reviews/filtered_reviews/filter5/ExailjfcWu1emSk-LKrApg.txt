I was anxious to write a review because I completely disagree with the one star reviews. My husband had the shrimp burrito, which was $8.67 and I had a steak burrito bowl, also $8.67. They were phenomenal! As for the comments about portion size, I can only speak for our meals and they were giant and well worth the price! The drive thru worked just fine. Our order came out exact and customer service was great! Maybe the veggie meals weren't as good, I'm not sure but we are definitely looking forward to going back!

Overall the flavor was great, it was fresh as you could see them making it behind the window and the portions (at least for our meals) were very large for the price! This place will only get busier!
