I have now been here twice in the month I've lived in Charlotte. Both times I have gone with family. The first time my aunt and I shared so we could try two things.  I got the chicken and shrimp burrito which was more than filling and she got the bbq mahi tacos which were so full of fish, you could hardly pick them up! The second time I returned and got the BBQ Mahi tacos because I liked them so much. Ended up bringing enough food home from our table that I had two other meals (brought home two tacos). This week I was there on Thursday night and we had just beat the crowd. They had 1/2 off NC Draft beers which was awesome! I will definitely return again soon!
