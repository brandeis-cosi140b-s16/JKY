Food, Service, and drinks are all top notch. I love spicy food and Los Dos delivers. My wife doesn't like it as spicy and there are options for her...Flautas! You MUST have the Adobada Ribs if you love intense heat WITH flavor. Kick Ass Margerita is great but I opt for the house Margo with a shot of one of their hundred tequilas...Cuervo Tres Generations for me. Anyway, you can get in and out quickly or stay for hours, relax, and enjoy! Cheers to John & John and the staff!
