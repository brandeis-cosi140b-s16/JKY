From a Mexican Vegan I love this place!! The food is great!! I am able to eat the tortillas, the beans and the chips!! All made without lard! The food is fresh and tastes homemade! I love the atmosphere and the service is wonderful! We have had James as our manager last night who took care of all of our needs! Friday night was fun on the patio with music playing and people dancing but inside still an environment you can bring your family to and have a nice dinner, the best of both!
