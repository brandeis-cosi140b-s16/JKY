Came here specifically because of YELP reviews and was well worth it! The customer service and friendliness of the guy at the counter was just the beginning. I asked about the flautas, the menu stated only beef, but he said they could make chicken no problem! They were great. We also ordered enchiladas, they were delicious as well! We will definitely be back!!
