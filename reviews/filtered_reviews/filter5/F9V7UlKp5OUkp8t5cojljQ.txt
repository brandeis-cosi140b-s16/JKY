Ritos is continuing to impress.  Consistent fresh homemade food.  I don't think its fair that they have received the few 1 star ratings that they have so I am updating my review.  Everyone who has given them a bad review has not even attempted to eat their food.  Its a restaurant.  In order to give a fair review, you have to eat the food.  The owner is always very polite, but he's also pretty honest.  If you are rude, he will most probably let you know, so the other reviewers obviously aren't telling the whole story.  This is the best place to eat in Phoenix, let alone Surprise.
