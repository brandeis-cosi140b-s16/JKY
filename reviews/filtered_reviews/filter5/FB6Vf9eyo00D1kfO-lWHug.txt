I've come here once for HH and twice for dinner. One of my favorite spots in the valley. The minute you walk into this underground-esque establishment, the ambience takes you over. Dimly lit, with an ultra-sexy atmosphere, the food is equally as impressive. My go to dish is the Rokerij Burger. Juicy, well-seasoned, and leaves you satisfied.  My only gripe is that it's always packed during the evening, and hard to get a table without a reservation. 

5 stars :)
