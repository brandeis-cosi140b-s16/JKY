Juan's is by far the greatest Mexican food spot in the valley. I may be biased since I have been eating here for 20 years now (Used to be located on 16th st where the Walgreens is). I dont need a cool "hippster" vibe to add to my meal....just give me the basics; Delicious, friendly with great service. 
Green Chille Burrito-Amazing
Rice and Beans-Amazing
Tamale, encilaldas, taco's...every item on their menu is a solid decision and you wont be dissapointed. 
New to the resturant? Ask the server for suggestions.
I have my favorite dishes there but after eating there so often I have literly asked the waitress to suprise me and have never been let down.
