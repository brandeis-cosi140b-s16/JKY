After enjoying the sunset with sangria and micheladas from the rooftop of the Clarendon Hotel, we headed downstairs for dinner with Mr. K and co. 

We started with the guacamole, chips, and salsas, which were immediately inhaled, and then the real fun began.  

Everyone cooed when the chicharr√≥n de queso -- a crispy, light chip that's really made from melted cheese -- arrived.  It sounds weird, but is heaven on a plate.  And as the menu says, "gringos, this is not a quesadilla." 

Everyone fell silent as we savored the elote (grilled corn on the cob smothered in cotija cheese and paprika).  We all fought the impulse to pick up our plates and lick off the cotija crumbs, and reached for more chips to get the last bits of cheesy, corny goodness off our plates.

Then, the awesome tacos arrived.  We opted for the cochinita (pork with a great citrus and achiote flavor) and the carne asada (beef with a nice charred tomato salsa).   

The service was attentive, without interrupting us.  The flavors were phenomenal, and the prices were ridiculously reasonable.  As Mike said "it's Mexican street food done well, and still at Mexican street food prices."   Our party included five adults and a 3 year-old.  Kudos to the server, who went out of her way to grant all the wishes of the 3 year-old (and the adults) at the table.

By the time we left, we has all asked when they would be open for breakfast the next day.  That's one of the best compliments I can give a place.
