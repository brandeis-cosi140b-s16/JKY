This is THE place for Mexican food in Las Vegas....and there are plenty of good places here. Started coming here in 2006 or so, love everything I get and it won't break the bank.

The soup!!!!
Great Drinks!
Amazing food
Best seafood dishes (as my partner claims, I hate seafood)
Home made tortillas
Chips and Salsa!!!!!

At least 50% of the customers are Mexican and come in groups. They do it right here.....It's worth getting off the strip for if your visiting, and the money you save eating away from the strip pays for your cab ride.

What are you waiting for?
