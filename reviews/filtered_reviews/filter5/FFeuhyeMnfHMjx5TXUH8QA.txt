Such great food! Really good mix of both styles. I ordered the Fusion Chimichanga. It was so large I didn't know where to start :-) . My boyfriend ordered their calamari taco, some wontons and shrimp ceviche. He loved all if it! The Calamari as really good. Would be awesome if they had it just as an appetizer on its own as well. Wonton soup was good too!
