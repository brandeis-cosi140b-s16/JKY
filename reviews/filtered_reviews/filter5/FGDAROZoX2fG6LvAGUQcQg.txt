Quintessential dive-y Mexican restaurant.  My family has been going here for 20 years (gosh, that makes me sound old) and it's just as good as it always was.  Don't expect any frills (like ANY), but do expect some tasty good.  I always get the machaca beef plate and I'm never disappointed.  TIP: if you're going on a weekend, get there early or be prepared to wait!
