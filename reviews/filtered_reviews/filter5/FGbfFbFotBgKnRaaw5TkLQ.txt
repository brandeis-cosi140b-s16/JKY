Since moving to the burgh from California, I've been on a never ending quest to find decent local tacos. This taco stand outside the grocery store doesn't disappoint! Tacos are cheap, authentic, and you get to doctor them up yourself with whatever salsas and toppings your heart desires. So far, I rate these as the most authentic Mexican tacos in the Pittsburgh area that I've come across. Note that as this isn't actually a restaurant, you'll have to stand around outside to eat them, but that's part of the experience. Also, if you're afraid of spice, avoid the orange (habanero?) salsa at all cost - it'll knock you flat on your back!
