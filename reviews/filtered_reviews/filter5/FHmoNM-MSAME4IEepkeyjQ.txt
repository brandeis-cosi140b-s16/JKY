Yum. Lovely decor. Cute patio for a nice day. Great Mexican beer selection. I was just reading that this restaurant is affiliated with Ponchos in central Phoenix. It doesn't get more authentic than that. Much fancier here, tho. The service was wonderful and the food was delicious. Came for lunch. Great tortas -I'd recommend getting beans over fries but both are good. Burritos delicious too. Mexican corn was amazing. No complaints!
