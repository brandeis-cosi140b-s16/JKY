Hole in the wall restaurant in a sketchy neighborhood but the food was so worth it. Ordered a 14inch pepperoni pizza and a double cheese boyger. The pizza wasn't anything special but was a great value and came out freshly made. Hot! The burger was delicious. 2 thick patties of meat with 2 slices of cheese, Onions, tomato, and relish. For 7 bucks you can get a big delicious burger with steak fries and soda... this blows any fast food burger meal out of the water at the same price. One of the best burgers I have had. Place lived up to the hype. Just try not to get shot getting there.
