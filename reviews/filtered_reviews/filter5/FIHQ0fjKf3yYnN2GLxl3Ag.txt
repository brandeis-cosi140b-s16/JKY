5 stars for Mexican food really? Oh yes this place is honestly that good! Started with chips and 3 types of house made salsa, the habanero was my favorite.  I had the Cilantro Garlic Shrimp and my husband Chile Verede con Nopales , both dish's were wonderful and my husband noted that the cactus was fresh not caned Service was excellent and Chef Paco even checked on us twice! The Cantina is very nice inside however it is attached to Sapphire's, little awkward for me but I will definitely return.
