Have to say that I've been coming here since this places opened. First time I have ever been ignored, meaning I was seated and no server came over to offer me a drink or take my order. I was going to change my review status to a lower grade, but a nice young lady (who is a manager) kindly came over to apologize and surprisingly offered to cover my tab for the evening. This place knows how to handle situations both good and bad. Thumbs up to the Salt & Lime management rocks! Keep it up guys.
