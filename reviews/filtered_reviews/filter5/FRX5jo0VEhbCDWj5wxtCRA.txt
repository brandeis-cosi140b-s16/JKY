OMG! what a great and incredible experience! The Tuesday Tacos were just incredible! i had way more tacos then i thought i would. the Carnitas taco were done to perfection both in spice and in taste all in all was a great combination. The fish taco, was good, and decent, but seemed to be missing something. ( I could not put my finger on what). the Pork adobe was a bit too spicy. I love spicy but not when it deprives me from tasting the rest of the food. and the margarita my oh my.  I am usually a classic margarita chick, but i read so many reviews about The Cucumber/Serrano margarita, that i just had to try it. I am so glad I did! delicious, tasty, spicy and super refreshing. absolutely loved the atmosphere as well. the Patio seating has a nice fire pit  to stay warm, and the whole ambiance is totally local. When you walk in, you get the feeling of being in a locals spot. very friendly from the person seated next to you to the person serving you. This local joint, has my support.
