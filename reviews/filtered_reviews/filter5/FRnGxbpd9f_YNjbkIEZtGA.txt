We love Frank and Finas. The food is as good as it gets. All made with extra fresh ingredients, great plating, wonderful flavors. This is more than standard fare, rice, beans, tortillas, etc. Here each dish is lovingly seasoned and cooked to perfection with special sauces, veggies, and cheeses. Our group of friends consider it THE BEST Mexican Restaurant in Las Vegas. We dine monthly and have never had an inferior experience. Try their specials. The wait staff is friendly and prompt, the drinks & chips keep rolling out.  The atmosphere intimate & casual. Dinners between $10 and $15.
