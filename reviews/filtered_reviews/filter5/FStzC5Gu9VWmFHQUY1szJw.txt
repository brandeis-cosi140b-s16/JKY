The chicken combo burrito is damn good. I get it nearly every week. While the quality of the chicken may vary at times, it's usually on point. Get it with the calabacitas and call it a day (or lunch). I can put it down, but I assume it'll be too big for some so take a burrito buddy b/c you are not allowed to waste this delicacy.
