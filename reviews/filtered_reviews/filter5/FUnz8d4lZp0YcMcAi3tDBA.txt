My husband and I found this gem while perusing the streets of Vegas for a some good Mexican food. I happened to remember hearing decent things about Roberto's so I figured why not try it out. 

Let me tell you that appearances aren't what they seem. When we pulled into this restaurant off S. Decatur, I briefly rethought my suggestion. It looked a little rundown and that made me a bit nervous. I figured we were already there, though, so might as well make the best of it. I am so glad we stayed! 

The food is amazing! I got a taco and enchilada while my husband got a burrito and enchilada. I was blown away at how good it was! My husband particularly enjoyed the pepper and salsa station with a variety of both. By the time we left we were stuffed. 

On top of the great food was the amazing service. The guy that took our order was courteous and even helped bring our food to the table as my hands were already full. 

Overall a great place to grab some great Mexican grub!
