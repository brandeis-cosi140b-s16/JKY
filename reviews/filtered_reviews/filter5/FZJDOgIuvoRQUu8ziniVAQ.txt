Oh so good! Food was nice and hot, very flavorful, customer service with a smile. Their hot salsa is very spicy but addicting. Been here twice and the food takes a little longer but hey, it's not a fast food place, the food is really good and worth the wait over and over.  Visiting from California and decided future Las Vegas trips will never be complete without a stop at Chile Verde Mexican grill!
