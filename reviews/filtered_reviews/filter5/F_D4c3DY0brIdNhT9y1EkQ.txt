Just finished my meal at this restaurant. The appetizer and main meal were superb. I had 2 ala carte tacos, a filet and shrimp taco and a fresh fish taco. Excellent! Our waiter, Arnoldo, was very knowledgeable,  helping explain the menu and made perfect suggestions.  Any time I am near Scottsdale, I will eat here!
