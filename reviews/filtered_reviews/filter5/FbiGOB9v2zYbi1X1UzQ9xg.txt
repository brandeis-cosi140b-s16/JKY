Never in a million years would I think to find great Mexican food inside a gas station. However, I've always thought the best Mexican food are found at the cheap joints. It is rare that I like the fancy Americanized Mexican joints.

As far as food goes, it's the best that I've found in my neighborhood. I've ordered the mini carne asada tacos. He really hooked it up by giving 2-3 times the normal serving of meat, the chicken rolled tacos with guacamole are crack, & the carne asada nachos are large enough to share with 3-4 people. You might as well forget about your diet if you are ordering those nachos. Don't forget to top your food with the red hot sauce. It has a spicy kick to it.

I like the affordable prices, affordable for the average college student. Cleanliness is always welcomed and it's reassuring to see him washing his hands before each order.

The only cons that I can think of-Only one guy working and I wish they were open later on weekends. Even though he is fast, I think they can use one more employee during the busy meal times.
