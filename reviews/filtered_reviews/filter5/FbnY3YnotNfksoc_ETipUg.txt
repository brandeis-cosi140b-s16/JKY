I very rarely right reviews, but our family's experience this evening was incredible. Firstly, the hostesses were gracious in letting us know that the hood in the kitchen was being repaired, but that some food and drinks were available. Respectful and appropriate expectation setting. Next was a fabulous server, conscientious and accommodating of a large party with 3 very small children. Management was extremely helpful and honest when it came to letting us know that repairs were going to be a while and when that wasn't an option for us (hungry kids=cranky kids) not only did they get us a reservation at their sister restaurant, they comped our meal and arranged transportation! 

The food, drinks and ambience at the Mission are always top notch, but the professional and kind service tonight was over the top. You have loyal customers and brand advocates for life! Well done and expect to see us again soon!
