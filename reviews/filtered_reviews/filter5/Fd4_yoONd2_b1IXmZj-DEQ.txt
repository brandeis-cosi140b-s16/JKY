The place can get crammed with people but the wait is worth it. Easily up there with some of my favorite al pastor spots in CA. And it's always a plus when they don't charge extra for guacamole like most places do. The pastor was flavorful and plenty juicy. The salsa was great too, had some kick but won't set your mouth on fire. This will be my go-to spot for tacos next time in Vegas.
