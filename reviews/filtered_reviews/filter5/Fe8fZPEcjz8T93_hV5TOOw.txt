My family calls it "The place with the face" because Viva Michoacan is tricky to say and there is a giant picture of a guy's face on the marquee. 

I have to say I am impressed that it is one of my family's favorite places to go! It is authentic Mexican. The food is phenomenal, I have had the Goat Leg soup as well as Chimichangas and a lot in between. Never had a bad time. They make the guacamole at the table and explain the process to you. I have never been here without a large group and they are always excellent, never messed up an order! 

Margaritas are strong and the Negro Modelo is cold. If you are in Henderson (Vegas' Tempe) or Vegas go and get the food here! You will not be disappointed!
