Very rarely am I blown away by a restaurant (especially one out of town) as we are kind of Vegas Food Snobs but our experience here was amazing! Very high end southwest cuisine (no quesidillas or enchiladas in sight) go for the short ribs, filet and fried bananas (with peanut butter mousse, swoon)  and the tableside guacamole is the best I've had in my life!  In case you haven't been here before we were both exceeding impressed!
