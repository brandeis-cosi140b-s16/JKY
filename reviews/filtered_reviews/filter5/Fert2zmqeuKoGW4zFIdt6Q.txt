Pretty convinient location- I had 2 taquitos and a shredded beef enchilada--- yummmm. Their salsa was a little mild for me *who eats sriracha on everything* but the flavor was good- and o thoroughly enjoyed my meal. 

I love their yellow Spanish rice too! We will be definitely returning to try other things on the menu!
