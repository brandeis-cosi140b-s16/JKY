In my opinion, this is the best place for Mexican food in Champaign! The fish tacos are my go-to, but each one is kind of small, so if you are hungry, I suggest getting 2 or 3. The prices are amazing considering how much you get. Each meal comes with complimentary chips and two kinds of salsa, one hot and one mild. The chips are delicious, and I think that they are homemade (or at least they taste like they are!). The staff are very friendly, and they will help you navigate the menu if it is your first time. They are also very fast. My whole family had food in front of us in about 3 minutes. It's definitely not the best place to go if you are looking to sit down for a long lunch, because there are very few seats in the place, and not much standing room. There are a few picnic tables outside, which are nice if it is a warm day out. I prefer getting my food to go, but I have sat there a few times, and it has been really nice! Overall, I would recommend this place to anybody coming through town, or to other students who haven't been yet! Absolutely worth it!
