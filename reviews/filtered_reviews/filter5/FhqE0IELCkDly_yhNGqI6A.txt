walking in to this place you smell all the carne asada cooking on the grill nothing like fresh cooked meat not like other places where they reheat it
I was worried i wasnt going to find a burrito/taco place coming from san francisco i had 100's to chose from and i got nervous when everyone said robertos was the place to go.  Anyways LOS TACOS ROCKS 
the tacos are loaded meat beans cheese and avocado and the burritos are awesome always hit the spot place is packed during lunch i usually hit up the drive though feel like its a little faster they have a lot of stuff on the menu definitely worth checking out
