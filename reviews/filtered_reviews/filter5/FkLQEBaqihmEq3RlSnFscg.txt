There are a million reviews for this place and most of them say the same thing...so I'm going to take the easy way out...this place rocks plain and simple. I had the Jade Chicken with Jerk Fried (Chicken) Rice. It was "sick" (that's slang for really amazing). I did the "menu demo" when I first tried out this place and was impressed. I liked the idea also. You don't see places doing that anymore. It reminded me of the true selling power of the sample...and damn good samples too! And it's super cheap for what you get. It ain't no PF Expensive's. I'm not even a huge snicker doodle cookie fan (chocolate chip is where it's at, folks) but the bonus cookie with your meal is just another fabulous concept and reward for eating at this great place in Phoenix.
