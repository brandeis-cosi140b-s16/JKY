I'm from Philly, so pretty much any mexican food from the south would have received at least a 4 star review but this place was over the top! After searching on Yelp for an hour I came across some photos of the interior which ended up making my decision for me. 

I absolutely love the vibe. It's upbeat, unique, trendy and a LOT of fun. I ordered a bunch of their signature drinks but I have to say that the cucumber one was the most refreshing. The guac was also killer, they mortar and pestle right before delivering to your table ensuring unbelievable freshness. We also ordered the beast burrito and an assortment of tacos. The crispy fish was by far the best taco. I thought I was going to love the Ahi but it was a little dry, skip it if you can. I didn't even get to the beast until the next morning but holy cow it was awesome. If you go to this restaurant you need to order the carne asada. Read the rest of the yelp reviews and you'll see what I'm talking about. Even if the food and drinks were terrible I would still give this place 4 stars based on the staff alone. Get thee people.
