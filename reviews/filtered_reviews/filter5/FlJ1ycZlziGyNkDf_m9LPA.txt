They have so many different salsas to pick from...(Mango, Strawberry etc etc) 
We tried almost all of them with the homemade chips as we waited for our food. 

I ordered the chicken Quesadilla, but this one came with a deep fried corn tortilla covering all of the goodness in the middle. It was great because it was gluten free friendly. It was a big meal and well worth very bite.
