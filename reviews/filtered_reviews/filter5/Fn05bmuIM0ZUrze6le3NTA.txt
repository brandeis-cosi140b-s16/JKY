Good food, GREAT SERVICE, descent prices. All in all 5 stars. Mr. Mercado himself was a stand out guy... Reason being, we wanted to have a good Mexican breakfast while we were in Vegas, found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. We had so much trouble getting there and when we did Mr. Mercado felt so bad that he actually offered us a ride back to our hotel, and guess what, he actually took us back to our hotel. You have to stop in and say hi to the staff as they are fabulous and super friendly, and the food is fantastic! Thanks Mr Mercado, thanks for hooking us up!
