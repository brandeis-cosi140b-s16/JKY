As many have noted, their roast pork is absolutely delicious. Be sure to order at least 1 of your sope, gordita, or taco order with the pork. So flavorful and moist.

The gorditas were better than the tacos, in my opinion. Corn tortillas were a little chewy for us, but the gorditas had a nice crispy exterior with the cheese and refried beans which add to the flavour.

Also had a burrito, which is really good as well. Not quite as much meat as I would have preferred, but the variety of ingredients within does provide a good flavor profile.

Overall it's relatively inexpensive, very flavorful, and efficient service.
