I'm surprised Barrio Queen only has 3.5 stars on Yelp.  I'm no stranger to Mexican cuisine having been brought up in a Mexican household and I struggle to find restaurants that are better than what I make at home.  Barrio Queen is definitely one of these places.  The taco menu is extensive; after tasting almost every taco, I can vouch that they're mostly really good. (The pescado was the only dud I found; that's mostly my fault because I don't love fried food.)  I've also had the Cochinita Pibil torta and the half order of the guacamole... both amazing.

It tends to be on the expensive side so I opt for Taco Tuesday where you can stuff yourself full of tacos, chips and salsa, beer, and margaritas for less than $20.
