I'm gonna have to join all the 5-star reviewers.  This place is TOTALLY AWESOME !!  (forgive my usage of the cliched 80s standby, but this applies here !!) 

Everything was just about right.

The service was prompt and helpful.
The salad was fresh and crispy.
The rice was filled with little chunks of green beans and carrots and I think corn too.
The refried beans were not overly fatty nor were they overly salty.
The guacamole was chunky and tasty, with BIG chunks of avocado.
The corn tortillas were light, soft, and fresh.
The Shrimp culichi sauce was so good that I was eating it with a spoon.
The Negra Modelo on tap in a 28-oz glass for $3 was a super-bargain and Oh So Cold and Yummy.
The chips were hot and fairly thick and a little oily - top notch.
The red salsa was smokey and had a bit of kick.
The green tomatillo/avocado salsa was about the best I've had in town.
OH YES I ALMOST FORGOT:  They gave me an "on the house" Ceviche tostada, and it was the BEST Ceviche I have EVER tasted.  I don't normally like it, but this was SCRUMPTIOUS.

Can't wait for tomorrow to munch on the leftovers.

This place is not only a great Mexican SEAFOOD restaurant - it's about as good as any REGULAR Mexican restaurant in town.

Miss out on trying this place? That would be a bad move.
