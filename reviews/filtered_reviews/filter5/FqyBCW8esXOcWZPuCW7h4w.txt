The Al Pastor and carne are tasty. Tacos are small so you will want to order at least three. I was pleasantly surprised by the black bean salsa - big fan!

I will definitely be back to try the fish tacos.

***I went back for the fish tacos. And the shrimp, and the beef cheek...and more pastor. Hot damn they were all so good. I will probably never not get the fish tacos again. The shrimp was fresh (and they seemed bigger than the other tacos). The pastor tasted even better than the last time. New rating is 5 stars (from 4).***
