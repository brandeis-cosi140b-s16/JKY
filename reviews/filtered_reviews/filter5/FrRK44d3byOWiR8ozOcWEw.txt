Went there about a year ago it was ok just had drinks But went on a Groupon tonight and had dinner with the family  and it was awesome the place looked a little different inside a lot nicer very clean . The service was great training a couple of new waiters but they had shadows with them and Still great service and the food was amazing we had steak fajitas , cheese crisp , and a chicken burrito all fresh and not heavy like some places serves mex food  drinks where spot on and kept our glasses filled. We will be coming back again!!
