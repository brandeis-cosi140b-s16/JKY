Nacho daddy is a local winner! Tried the enchilada nachos on my servers recommendation, very tasty. My only mistake was coming in alone. I don't eat much & these nachos are huge, definitely coming back to share with friends. Also had the margarita. I have to say it was one of the tastiest I've ever had & I can see why it's a local winner. The manager Sarah was wonderful as was my whole experience.
