Awesome new restaurant in Dilworth!  I went there last night with a friend and after being open less than a week, the place was packed!  We were greeted immediately by the owner who gave us a description of the cocktails...he recommended the Bakersfield margarita and I'll probably never have anything else there...yummy!  The atmosphere is vibrant and casual with very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  I think this is going to be my new go-to spot in Dilworth for cocktails, good food and hanging with friends.
