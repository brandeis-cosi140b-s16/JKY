We had a group of six family members who met at Abuelo's by Chandler Mall for lunch.  We all love Mexican food.  Abuelo's menu had a good variety of food and the menu was different than a typical Mexican restaurant.  A section on the menu was even reserved for Tex-Mex .. nummy.

We started with the Guacamole dip.  That was fantastic and I would even go back just for that.  However, I did save room for the luncheon special with a single cheese and onion enchilada, beans and "papas".  

I thought I was full.  However, others at the table "had" to order and share a hot "Chocolate Eruption"  which consisted of a chocolate bundt cake and ice cream.   There was no way I wanted any .... until I saw it.  It's probably the best dessert I have ever tasted.

I tried to give this restaurant a 4* rating but couldn't think of anything that knocked it down from a 5* so that's what it really deserves.

We will return!!!
