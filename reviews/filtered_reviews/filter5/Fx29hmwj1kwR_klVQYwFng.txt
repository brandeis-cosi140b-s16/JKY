Best Enchiladas I tried in Phoenix, better than gadzooks that according to yelp, they are ranked number 1! Going back to Dick's, the sauce is authentic New Mexican flavor, but what made it for me was that they use Blue Corn tortillas!  That's going above and beyond!  Service is awesome, the cooks are awesome, nice Mexican gentleman and a white guy that seem to make a great duo! Love the mimosas nice and strong!  Great Bar, great place for our community!  Need more bars, restaurants like these!  Bring on the Happiness!
