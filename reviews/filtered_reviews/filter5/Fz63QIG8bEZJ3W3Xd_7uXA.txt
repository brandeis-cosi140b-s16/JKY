The neighborhood seemed rough & the store front is questionable. Inside is a few tables (it's quiet & cozy)
The food is done Chipotle style.. (You pick & build it)
We chose a quesadilla 3.99
Super crane asada  burrito with with all the good stuff.(combo includes drink & chips)  6.99
We got a *free* sample of jalape√±o cream cheese which was amazing! 
Fresh NONFAKE guac (rare these days!) (1.75)


The *only* questionable part is how much MSg is used! :) 


Super Burrito + quesadilla + bean burrito + sangria + medium drink =  $ 19.57

We will be back!
