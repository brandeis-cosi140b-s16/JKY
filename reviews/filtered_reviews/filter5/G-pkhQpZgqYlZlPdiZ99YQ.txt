Good Mexican food is hard to find in the Midwest, but you can find some here. The corn tortillas are made fresh, which makes a world of difference. The salsa is spicy, and the pastor and carne asada tacos are what you should get. They also offer classic Mexican dishes like mole, chile relleno, and menudo and pozole on the weekend. Tacos are served Mexico City street taco style with only chopped onions and cilantro on top. The only thing I don't really like about Taqueria Guadalajara is that the entrance opens onto the kitchen, which feels really weird. Dining room is in the back.
