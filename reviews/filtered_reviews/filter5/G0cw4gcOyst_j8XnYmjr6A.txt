Amazing. Just amazing. This place is covered in authentic Spanish decor with plenty of space for sitting. The horseshoe shaped bar is perfect for a night to watch some sports. The Street Tacos would probably be the best tacos I have ever had. Of course with all of this greatness be prepared for a 20-30 minute wait. This place is always packed with hungry locals
