Again and again this is one of those restaurants that keep surprising me. This is the second time I have ordered for delivery , and again their delivery service was 15 minutes from the time I had ordered it. I had to ask Paul the deliveryman and kitchen staff member if he was cooking it in his van and just on call in this area it is true that there are only a mile away from me but still 15 minutes I can't have a pizza delivered in 30 minutes let alone 15 minutes today my mother water the flaunt this and she said they were out of this world delicious plenty of guacamole plenty of sour cream plenty of cheese. Not to mention the fact that they have a lot of different types of Salsa all of which that I have tried so far have been great what I look forwards thousand is if it's hot it should be hot with a lot of flavor behind it. The great thing is is even there mild salsa has a lot of labor behind it without the heat anyone that is in their delivery area should try them out. And if you're not in their delivery area. Get off your ass and go there the restaurant is great
