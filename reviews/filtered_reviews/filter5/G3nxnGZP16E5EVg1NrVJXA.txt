Such a great night getting to know the new Container Park!  I was very happy with the entire evening and wanted to end it on an even better note with some food from one of the new joints.  We decided on Pinches Taco.  One, because the name was awesome and two, I heard the food was great!

It's in the north east corner of the Container park.  Just like all the stores in the park, it's a small joint, however, offers a lot of seating and tables right outside.  When I visited the location, it was pretty heavily staffed.  I didn't have to wait in line at all and trust me, there were a lot of people, being the grand opening weekend.  The staff was super friendly, everyone greeted me and other customers.  Service was remarkably fast!  Might have had something to do with opening weekend :) Awesome!

There was a lot going on in the menu, so I just settled on Pinche Combination plate for $8.95.  You can choose Any 3 tacos from the menu, and it also comes with rice, beans and chips.  I decided on the three most popular things:  Beef (Asada), fish and shredded pork.  Oddly enough, the pork wasn't really the star.  That taco was served with red salsa and chopped onions.  The asada was perfectly seasoned and flavorful, chopped onions, chopped cilantro and green salsa.  The fish (unknown) was THE BEST one for me.  Battered and perfectly seasoned, served with a cabbage slaw and red salsa.  The most amazing fish taco!

Man, those fish tacos alone, are worth the return trip.  I just can't stop thinking about it. I work downtown and think this place is super convenient.  I can't WAIT to get back.  Thanks for sticking around, Pinches Tacos!
