Food superb and way too much to eat for lunch! Service by KIRSTIE was even better than superb friendly, attentive and super quick with refills and the bill! Coupled with a Groupon I didn't mind the 35 mile drive (actually was already in Scottsdale so an additional 7 miles). Would highly recommend but go hungry and ask for KIRSTIE. Had sampler platter and special Inferno chicken burrito. First time visitors get a free tamale! GREAT
