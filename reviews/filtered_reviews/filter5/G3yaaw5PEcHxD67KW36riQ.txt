I've been to RuRu's twice now and really enjoyed both visits. Both the interior restaurant and the patio are just beautiful. The half price margaritas on Monday were a pleasant surprise! The queso is delicious, and the tacos may look small but are surprisingly filling and very flavorful. The service was pleasant both times, no complaints. I'll be back!
