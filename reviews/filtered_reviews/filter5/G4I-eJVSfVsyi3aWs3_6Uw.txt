I come here all the time, several times per week in fact and I love it. Their shakes are killer (thanks for the wide straws) and the burgers are fresh and delicious. What really makes the Stand stand out is their employees. They are always the best personalities and so willing to be helpful and kind. Honestly, I have rolled through here likely over 100 times and have no ever had a bad experience. I love this place because the ingredients are fresh, the service is great, the place itself is unique and its close to home! :)
