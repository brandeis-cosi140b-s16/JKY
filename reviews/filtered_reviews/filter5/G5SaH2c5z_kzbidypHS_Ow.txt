CARNE ASADA DELICIOUSNESS in my mouth! My friends have been telling me about this joint ever since they came back from their Vegas trip, so I knew I had to check this place out for my edc trip. 

They have so many different meats you can choose from, but of course I love my carne asada so I got four of those. The meat was so juicy, tender, and well seasoned... Just like how my Mexican babysitter used to make em. 

The boyfriend had carne asada fries and couldn't even finish a half order...! So beware, if you want their carne asada or any other fries.. Get the half order if you're just eating them yourself! He also had their al pastor taco. He seemed to love both. 

Workers were very friendly too. Especially since we walked in when there was everyone and their mom from Vegas - lines were out the door! This place goes down in the books for another must stop whenever I'm on the strip!
