Discovered this place last month and have already been twice! The house margaritas are excellent!! I ordered the carne asada torta and the carne asada burrito and was not disappointed. The place has a very relaxed atmosphere. There was a dj one night and the other night several televisions were on with music playing in the background. I Highly recommend this place to meet up with friends and eat some delicious food!
