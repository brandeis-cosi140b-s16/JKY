Stumbled upon Los Taquitos while staying at a hotel nearby, not realizing it was a local favorite. Delicious tacos! Carne asada was super flavorful and the sauce was spicy and delicious. Chips and salsa was good, not great, but it was a great meal none the less. Very cute interior and the staff was friendly too.
