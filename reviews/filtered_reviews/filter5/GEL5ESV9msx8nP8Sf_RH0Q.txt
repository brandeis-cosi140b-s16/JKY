Big Burrito restaurants are always a hit; however Mad Mex holds a special place in my heart!  One of the few restaurants I have worked at (Robinson location), that I would return to eat at.  

The new site is pure funky fun; it's hard to believe a dusty old rug store used to be there.  The view from the front garage door is actually kind of pretty with Casbah across the street with the rooftops of Franklin West houses popping through the trees, give a springlike high energy to the place.  They couldn't have timed their opening any better.

We went at 4:30 and immediately were seated; however, at 5:15, it started to get busy for Happy Hour.  I always get the San Fran (mild) Los Wingos Wrap and they had stuffed it to the Max with chicken.  Awesome.

I give it 5 stars because it's so much roomier than Atwood and more convenient than McKnight Rd or Robinson.  Thank you Big Burrito for granting our wish for a Shady Side Mad Mex!!!
