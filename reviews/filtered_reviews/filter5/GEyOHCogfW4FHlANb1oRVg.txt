This place is eye candy - beautifully decorated! Every fabric, every piece of furniture, every wall treatment...OTT. The employees are friendly and well dressed, and everything from the food down to the dinnerware and rolled silver seems thoughtfully selected/presented. (the plates are expecially colorful and v. pretty) I ordered the Tilapia with the mixed veggies - both delicious - and I'd order that again...IF there were any Abuelo's where I live (California). *sigh*
