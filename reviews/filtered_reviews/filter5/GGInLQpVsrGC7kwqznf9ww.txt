I was buying a guitar across the street at Guitar Tree..and wondered over to Taco Guild for lunch. My girlfriend and I were so blown away by the decor of this place! Like an old church slightly converted to a great place too eat, drink and hang out. The service was great and we thought the food was excellent..Chips & Salsa great..My taco's were so good and they had all these different sauces..You know, if you're a cheapskate you might go somewhere else..but we were perfectly happy to shell out 50 bucks for lunch and drinks..it was fun and we'll be back
