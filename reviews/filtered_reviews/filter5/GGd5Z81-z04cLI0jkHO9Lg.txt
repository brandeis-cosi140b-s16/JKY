One of the best places to eat in Vegas period. Always packed and can be a little confusing for first timers as hordes of people seem to be haphazardly standing in random locations but fear not there is an order to the madness. There are different lines for each of the different meats. I'd say the hectic atmosphere even adds to the charm of this place. Great place to end a drunken night or grab a cheap but delicious bite. Order the Pastor with pineapple!
