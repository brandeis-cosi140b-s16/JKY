Cost to quality is just two thumbs up...!  Compared to other overpriced restaurants, this is the must-try place for real taco in Las Vegas.  

A little inconvenient eat-in, but you can find additional tables on the curb side of tents outside.  Wonderful experience with authentic Mexican tacos at surprising 2$ price tag.  Abodado taco is my favorite and Veggi Quesadillas is beyond your imagination... 

If you can speak Spanish, ordering might be easier, but fellow customers were friendly enough helping me order.

Wonderful place....!
