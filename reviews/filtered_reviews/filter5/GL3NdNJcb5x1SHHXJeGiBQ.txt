We stopped by Nacho Daddy for a late night meal and drinks. My wife and I ordered the Thai Nachos and a couple margaritas. 

The Nachos were great. If you love Nachos, they got Nachos here. Lots and lots of Nachos to choose from. Not only were the combinations unique, they were super tasty! The cheese sauce was simply divine. Not even close to the jarred crap you find in the super market. The flavors blended together nicely. It also was nice that you got a heaping portion of these tasty treats.

Speaking of tasty treats, the margaritas were very good too. Once again, nothing was just plain and simple. I had a Sriracha Blood Orange Margarita and my wife opted to try the Pomegranate Margarita. Full of good liquor and juices. 

I almost got the courage to try their famous scorpion shot, but then I chickened out. Oh well, next time =)
