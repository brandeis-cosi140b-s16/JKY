I love, love, love this place!!
We happened upon it right after it's opening & have been regulars ever since.
Everything about it makes me happy.  The cuisine is modern Latin fusion and it's sooo tasty and unique.  I try to order something different every visit and have yet to be disappointed.  The tequila selection and cocktails are one of a kind.  I highly recommend giving the blended ones a taste, even if they're described as spicy!
Prices are absolutely reasonable for what you get and the owners are just about always on the floor.
Go for drinks, small plates, brunch, lunch or dinner and you'll be satisfied.  The ambiance also lends itself to being a sexy, but cool date spot.  We've also brought some important clients for dinners there.
Very cool.
