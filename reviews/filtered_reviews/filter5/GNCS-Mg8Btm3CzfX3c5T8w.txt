Best Mexican in Phoenix (so far in my 6 years here).

Food is all around great. Authentic Mexican platter style dishes at reasonable prices. Their frijoles de Ora(I think that's what the say) are amazing and my wife will drag me there just for chips and salsa! 

Wednesday nights, kids meals are like $1.50 and they have a menus of about a dozen dinner plates for under 8 bucks. Amazing to eat a huge meal for 4 at under $20! Believe me tho, it's worth coming on regular price nights anyway. 

The bar is always busy and they seem to have a good selection of both hard and soft beverages. 

Enjoy!
