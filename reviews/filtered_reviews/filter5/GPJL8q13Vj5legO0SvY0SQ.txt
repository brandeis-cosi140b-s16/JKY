Two words: Taco Tuesday. It's so good it even alliterates. It's so good that it's just a dollar. Or maybe that's what makes it even better. But even when it's not a Tuesday, this place is excellent. Deeeeelicious tacos, tons of vegetarian food, super quick service - everything is too awesome. Especially when it's Taco Tuesday.
