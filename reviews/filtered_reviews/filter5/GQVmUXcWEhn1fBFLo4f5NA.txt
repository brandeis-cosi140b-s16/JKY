Pepe's is my ULTIMATE FAVORITE mexican restaurant ever!!!  I live all the way in Henderson and I'm always down to drive the distance for this place.  I usually get their carne asada soft tacos and I've never been disappointed.  The great thing about this place is that they're open 24 hours a day and the food is pretty cheap.  Lots of my Mexican friends have said Pepe's food is just as good as a homecooked meal.  It's a bit of a drive from the strip but it's worth the visit.
