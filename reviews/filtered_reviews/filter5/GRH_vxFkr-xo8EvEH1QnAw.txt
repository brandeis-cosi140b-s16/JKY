I LOVED this place!!! The food, the service, and the atmosphere were all awesome in my book. I had the chicken fajitas, whatever it is that they season their onions and peppers with is by far the best I have had in a very long time!!! I can not wait to go back and try all of their other amazing looking dishes. I recommend this place!!!
