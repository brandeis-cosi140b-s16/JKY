I have never been disappointed with this place. Their sangria and margs and sangria are awesome. The nacho torta is the bomb and the chips and guacamole is a must. If you like beer they have dos Equis amber on tap. Sitting out side on the patio is great if the weather is decent. I would recommend this place to anyone.
