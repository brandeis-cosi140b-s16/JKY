Really nice surprise, this place. Came here on a whim based on other Yelper's reviews so we expected a decent experience however they really exceeded our expectations. 

The Tableside Guacamole is spot on - great ingredients simply prepared - we consumed every last delicious bit. 

Everything ordered was well balanced, flavorful, and a real value. But our experience was really made memorable, as all are, by the attentive but not clingy service. A nod to Tiffany at the bar who is very capable and clearly cares about her customers. 

It is next to a strip club which is not our thing but they are a separate business so do not let that dissuade you.
