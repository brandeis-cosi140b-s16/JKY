After seeing the good reviews we decided to try Abuela's. First impression when I  walked in was comfortable & welcoming. The cashier  (could of been the owner, with the passion & pride she showed for ingredients and menu items) was very welcoming, and after quick chitchat finding out we were new customers she was very informative on ingredients and preparation for items we picked.  I wasn't quite sure about the combination of ingredients for my shrimp burrito. It was great. It can't be compared to other shrimp burritos I've had in the area because Abuela's shrimp burrito has a different flavor combination that's refreshingly different and it does make other shrimp and rice burritos seem plain. As for what my family had, I can't remember. We didn't share and no leftovers. Lol.  I wish We would've tried Abuela's sooner.
