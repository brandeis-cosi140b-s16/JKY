one of the best meals i've had in years!

I hope he opens one of these in LA :)

First, we began with Singapore Slings ( orig Raffles Singapore Recipe ) - done with fresh made pineapple juice - YUM! I think our entire table had 2 each before dinner.

Then the food just kept coming -- I love spicy food and they did all the vegan spicy well. The folks at my table that ate meat loved their meals just as much. The chinese noodles done with mexican carne asada on top seemed to be a huge fav. 

Highlights include:
The Hearts of Palm Salad
The Taro Root and Asparagus
The Glass Noodles
Mushroom Tacos

I really could have sat there for 6 hours eating.... thanks Jose!
