Been back several times and tried a few other items on their menu:

Carne Asada Burrito w everything. Holy Cow! This thing is bigger than my arm. It puts chipotle to shame. It comes with two heaping scoops of rice, two scoops of beans, two scoops of carne asada, onions, cilantro, pico de gallo, cheese and sour cream and it's only $6 w tax. And I'm talking serving spoon scoops, not tablespoon status. It's a bit overwhelming for me, though. My BF loves it. I usually get mines in a smaller version and go without a few items. I like mines with one scoop of rice, no beans, carne asada, onions and cilantro and a scoop each of red and green sauce. It's like a perfect burrito and how I'm used to eating my burritos growing up in LA. 

Super Nachos are huge. Enough for a family. It comes loaded with everything they put in the burrito I described above. It's decked out til you almost can't close the box.

Aside from the asada, I've had the pork on a few occassions. It's moist and spicy. when I get tacos, I get one with the pork for variety. Still the asada is king, here.

I like how they assemble everything in front of you. You get to tell them exactly how you want your food. Less of this, more of that... any way you like it. 

Chips and salsa are free upon request. Whoo! Now this is how authentic Mexican restaurants roll! I wont even step foot in any -bertos place anymore.
