I was in the area on Saturday evening and passed by this place while looking for something to kill time. Dos gringos is nothing special, but it seemed to have a great patio and I wanted to enjoy the nice weather while getting some work done, so I grabbed a table away from the regulars that were at the bar watching the game. I had just sat down and opened up my bag when I heard someone ask "how's your afternoon going?" I figured it was the server talking to the group of four that sat down behind me, but when I turned around, she was standing there, patiently waiting for me to finish what I was doing. I think she said her name was Tasha. Awkwardly, I said hi, and asked for a beer. She was right back with the beer and when asked if I wanted any food, I came to a crossroads. I was hungry, but knew I was going to meet up with friends for dinner, so I just asked her for something delicious and small. A little bit later she came back with what she called mini chimis, tiny chimichangas, unless I'm assuming too much. They were delicious and I would have ordered another round, but it was time to go, so the server brought me my check. If you happen to stop at dos gringos on priest, make sure you ask for short brunette named Tasha, she's attentive and borderline too sweet.
