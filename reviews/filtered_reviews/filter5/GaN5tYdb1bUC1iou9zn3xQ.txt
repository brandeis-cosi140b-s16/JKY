Ate at the bar for dinner. Gracie made me an awesome skinny margarita and hubby had a yummy house margarita. Totally agree with other reviewers. Salsa and beans with chips were yum! The soup they give us good too. 

I had the #1 combo with a chile relleno, beef taco and chicken enchilada. Hubby had shrimp fajitas. Fajitas were good -normal fajitas. Coming from So Cal, I know good Mexican food. My dinner was one of the best I have had! 

They also had a great guitar player which made for a really cool atmosphere. Will definitely come here next time through Vegas!
