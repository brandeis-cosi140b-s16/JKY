All you need is a jug of their secret recipe salsa, a large Joanne special cheese crisp, and the Gollo burro wet with green sauce. The service is sometimes sparse when it gets busy because they usually only have one or two waitresses running at any given time, but they are all amazingly friendly and always make us feel just like family! Your patience is always rewarded with delicious family recipes that you can't find anywhere else in this state and if you give them the chance, they'll make a lifelong fan out of you too!
