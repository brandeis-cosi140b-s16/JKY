My favorite Mexican food restaurant. There is one in Goodyear as well but I actually drive out of my way to come to this location (food is better here for some reason). I usually always get the cheese enchilada meal and its always amazing, chips and salsa are so good too (and rather addicting!). 

Always look forward to eating here :)
