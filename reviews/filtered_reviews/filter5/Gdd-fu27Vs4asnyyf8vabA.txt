Updated review.... I have moved to Texas since I wrote my first review on Rudy's Burritos. My son says we should live here so we can eat at Rudy's every day. (he really means EVERY DAY!) Or we should win the lottery and pay Rudy to move to where we live now. He could live on Rudy's bean & cheese burrito. Rudy is so nice. The customer service is awesome, always has been.I have had several items on their menu, from bean and cheese burritos to chorizo and eggs, to the yummy delcious california burro to tamales that melt in your mouth to.... YUM! Their street tacos are devine... Their tortillas are chewey yummy goodness. I highly recommend stopping in if you're in the area and like Mexican food. If you don't like Mexican food, you may stil like it, cause it's that damn good!!!
