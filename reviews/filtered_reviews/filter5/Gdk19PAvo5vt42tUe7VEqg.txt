Okay, I'm going to have to recant my previous review. I just had a totally fantastic lunch of Torta Carne and corn on the cobb. That Torta is off the hook! I gobbled it up tomatoes and all and I flippin' hate tomatoes. The corn is slathered in buttery butter and cotija cheese, add a little pepper and it is sublime. 
Service was super fast. Call me Mary Kay but the two cuties behind the counter made the wait pretty tolerable. 
America, I'm sorry I snapped. I didn't know. I will be back for my Torta as it is now on my list of foods-I-want-every-day.
