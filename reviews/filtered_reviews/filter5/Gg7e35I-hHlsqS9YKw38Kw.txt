Wow this place is another hole in the wall gem.  this food is as authentic as it gets.  It was recommended to me by a friend that is from Mexico.  Its probably not exactly like they do it there, but I am told its as close as you'll get up here.  The prices are very fair, and the portions are generous.  You might even need to spit it up if you are not a big appetite.  All the food is fresh, and the service was great.  You know that you have hit the right place for authenticity when you are the only gringo in the place, and Spanish language ESPN is on the TV.  You have to try a torta if you go there for the first time.  I mean the name King of Tortas say it all.  I recommend the agua frescas too, as that was such a great combination with the heat of the food.  I have been there a few times, and both the cuban and carne asada were not to disappoint.  There is plenty of seating, and I did not have to wait to be seated on any of my visits.
