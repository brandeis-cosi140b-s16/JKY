I am from San Diego, CA, the nearby border city to TJ, Mexico. With that said, I have high standards when it comes to Mexican food. In fact, one of the most irritating things about relocating from San Diego to Scottsdale was the lack of a bomb taco shop on every corner here... Super Buririto and Fiesta Burrito you are not doing it for me!! 

But America's Taco Shop does not disappoint! While I usually am a chicken chic, I cannot believe their El Pastor taco.. With pineapple slices.. yes pineapple in your taco with pork, salsas and much more! Their margaritas for just $5 taste good.

And I think the hidden secret is the America's Corn (do yourself a favor and order this in addition), but here's a tip, have them cut it off the cob for you so that you don't have to worry about getting corn in your teeth or on your neighbor... Ew. 

Oh man! America's Taco Shop is one of my favs!!
