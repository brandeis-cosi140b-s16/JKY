Cantina 1511 has food ninjas. My tastebuds were unsuspecting and did not see it coming.

I think these may have been the best fajitas I've ever had. That is kind of weird. I don't have fajitas that often because they're kind of labor intensive. Also, they're not really that Mexican-y and kind of safe. Who wants to do all that construction for a stir fry taco?

I had to eat my words which was hard because I was also full from eating those scrumptious fajitas. The ingredients were fresh, starting with chicken, peppers and onions. Making a great meal with fresh ingredients is almost idiot proof. The meat and vegetable were seasoned with something different I can't quite figure, maybe a marinade?, but it wasn't the usual cumin and salt overdose. My dining companion ordered fish tacos and I'm sure I could have eaten those as well.

The restaurant has a chic ambiance and is large. However, the hardwood floors and wooden interior give it a friendly and intimate vibe. So despite the size of the dining area, it's not faceless.

Cantina 1511 isn't striving for the "authenticity" of an ordinary Mexican joint and that's a good thing. You won't find the standard numbered menu items, 1 taco, 2 enchiladas or plates swimming in enough cheese, sauce and oil to put you to sleep on the drive home. That's not a diss; I do love a spot where everyone speaks Spanish and serves it up that style. However, Cantina offers a welcome hipper and fresher take on Mexican fare.
