I remember when Ro and I ate at this restaurant on the day it first opened years and years ago. We were the 4th table to occupy this place. While our food was being made, the manager gave us coupons for free margaritas on our return visit. I never returned to the restaurant until this past Saturday. 

I purchased a special on Living Social and realized we had to use it before Dec. 12th. So we trekked down and enjoyed a great meal. Loved the Chicken Quesadilla! Adam, our waiter, was great as well. I'm certain we'll be back to this place. Cheers***
