Ok
The food here, its freakin' good.  Really good.

Like, no joke.  

And from seeing this place, you wouldn't think it.  But their food, really is impressive.  And cheap.

Try their mini chimichangas... or their supergooeycheeseychimi (which is basically a beef chimichanga topped with tons of cheese and cream cheese and more cheese)

Their drinks are good and average  Good place for happy hour, or drinking during the day.
