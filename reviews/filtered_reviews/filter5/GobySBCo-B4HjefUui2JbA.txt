So I'm super picky when it comes to Mexican food. But in Vegas this is my Favorite spot. Went here for my first time a few days ago and was impressed. The outside is big, beautiful and traditional looking. The Servers and Hostesses where dressed in traditional clothing. ( Love it!) The Inside is decorated like a Fiesta. Love the atmosphere- everyone that took care of us was great, attentive and had great conversation with us. And as if that wasn't enough the food and drinks were Great! The portion sizes and flavor was perfect. Couldn't have been happier with our experience here. So worth the drive off the strip..
