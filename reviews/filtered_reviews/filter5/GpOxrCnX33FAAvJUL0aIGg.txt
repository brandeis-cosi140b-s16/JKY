Absolutely AMAZING.  I had reservations for New Years Eve.  Got right in right on time.....excellent service from our waiter, our water glasses constantly filled.....amazing menu, excellent recommendations.  The service was absolutely STELLAR. The food....WOW!  Fresh, delicious and prepared with obvious passion.  This was my best dining experience since I've been in AZ.  Such a refreshing and delicious breath of fresh air in a sea of chain restaurant after chain restaurant that makes up 99% of the restaurant choices in Phoenix.  I cannot wait to go back!!
