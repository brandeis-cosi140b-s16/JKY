I ate lunch here every Friday for about 6 years in a row. There is a period where they close down for a couple weeks to do house cleaning. But other than that I'm in. Their food is spicy. Service is "as to be expected".  Meaning this isn't a 5 star restaurant and they aren't being paid % star wages. I have no complaints. The food is delicious. I must have had everything on their menu. My go to though is the green chile burro enchilada style with green chile. I love their green salsa. Their tacos come with potatoes as part of the filling. It's something different for me, but it was a welcome addition. 

I would definitely recommend this place for good Mexican food.
