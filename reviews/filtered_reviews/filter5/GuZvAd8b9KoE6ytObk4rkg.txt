I have lived in Phoenix for many years and had never tried this well known institution. I had lunch there yesterday. This place has been there I think over 50 years. I ordered the individual Mexican Pizza with Beef Machaca. So good, loaded with lots of goodies to include guacamole and sour cream...The place is small and old looking but it adds to the charm. There is a patio outside to eat at also. I remember that President Bush ate here along with many stars. nice and casual, and the prices are very reasonable. great parking too.
