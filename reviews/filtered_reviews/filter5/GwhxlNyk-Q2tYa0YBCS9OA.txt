Por favor...someone pass me a napkin.  My mouth is still watering!  

This place has been on my list of "must try's" for quite a while.  A friend and I were meeting for lunch elsewhere, when we remembered Central was closed off for the Veteran's Day Parade.  Ok...so I do appreciate the Veteran's for all they have done...but I have to be selfish today and thank them for the parade, because without that, I wouldn't have ended  up at Gallo Blanco!

Was a little busy for lunch, so we sat ourselves at the bar and ordered the most refreshing sangria I have had in a very long time, while we waited for our table. 

We were greeted by a very friendly server who brought us some ice water while we finished our sangrias.  We chose to start off simple with some Chips and Salsa.  Salsas.  Not spicy yet BOASTING of flavor! Smokiness...savory...just delicious!  I love the tostadas they use here as well, nice and thick!  I could have eaten just the chips and salsa as my meal!  

I couldn't decide what to order and my friend told me that this place had some pretty bangin' carne asada.  I chose to heed her advice and I'm glad I did! I ordered the carne asada torta and HOLY GUACAMOLE!!!  The most tender and flavorful carne asada I've had while I've lived in Phoenix.  The torta was more like a tort-o-my-god!  Jam packed with carne, guac and love!  I pretty much shed a few tears when I was finished.  I kind of hoped I could do a twitch of my nose and make another one appear, but that didn't happen.  I just looked like I was having a severe allergy attack or facial spasms.  :-(

The ambiance is super trendy and fun.  A great mix of clientele from families, businessmen, and hotel guests (since it is in the Hotel Clarendon...super swanky!)

I can't wait to go back for Happy Hour and try some tacos and chips and salsa and sangria and these WICKED looking bloody mary's I saw walking around!  

Viva el Gallo Blanco! Ahuuuuaaaaa!
