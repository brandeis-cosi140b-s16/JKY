Wow!!! The fish tacos were outrageously delicious! So much flavor, and the perfect amount of spice. The shrimp burrito was also delicious, and the horchata tasted homemade. We got a warm welcome when we arrived and found they had a great selection of beer. I wish we were locals because we would definitely become regulars!
