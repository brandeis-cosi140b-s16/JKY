My favorite Mexican food hands down.

I love Popo's so much I literally crave it once a week.  The portions are so huge that you can eat Popo's twice in a row.  I have had pretty much everything on their menu with the exception of their salads and fajitas.  My favorite is a toss up between the pollo especial and the shredded beef tacos.  The Spanish rice is the BEST I have EVER had....don't tell my Nana I said that!  The customer service is outstanding.  I don't know of any Mexican food restaurant that can top Popo's.  The only negative is that it is ALWAYS packed!
