I really liked this place.  The hostess was nice and so was our waiter.  The service was good and they were on top of refilling our chips, salsa and bean dip.  At the end of the meal, the owner came to talk to us and ask us how our food was.  This place is new and there's not much decoration, but there's enough.

I love love love that they have a vegetarian section in their menu.  The menu has 6 different vegetarian plates.  I ordered the vegetarian fajitas with no sour cream or cheese and it came out flaming and on fire.  It was a pretty cool presentation of it.  The servings are big and I was full after eating 2 fajitas. My bf ordered the vegetarian enchiladas and he said it tasted good.  We both had leftovers to take home for tomorrow.  I also our love our bill and how it $20 for the both us!!  It's hard to eat out at restaurants nowadays for two people and pay $20 for the meal.

This place also has happy hour from 3pm-7pm.  If I can remember correctly, the happy hour menu has nachos, fajitas, and something else for like $5.  They also have alcohol for happy hour too.  I think this place will give Frank and Fina's and Lindo a run for their money.   

I will definitely come back and try more stuff on their menus.  I'm gonna try hard not to stuff my face with chips, salsa and bean dip so that I have room to order dessert!! :)
