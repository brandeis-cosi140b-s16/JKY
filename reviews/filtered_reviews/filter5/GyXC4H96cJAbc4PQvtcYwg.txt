I'm in *love*! Today was our first time to Juan's. We recently moved into the neighborhood and found it in Yelp. The reviews are great and we discovered that Juan's is just as promised. Authentic. Delicious. Friendly. But... Don't be in a hurry. They're a busy family owned place, so sit back, relax and enjoy the tasty chips and salsa! I recommend a large drink so you don't need to ask for refills. The tacos are amazing and the green tamales are to die for! Don't think it over. Just go to Juan's!
