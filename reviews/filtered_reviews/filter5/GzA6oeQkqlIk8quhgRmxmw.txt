We were referred by one of my wife's clients who have turned us on to great places like  Bosa Doug-nuts, so we went last Sunday and with all new places decided to order some of our Favorites
Shrimp Taco
Carne Asada Taco
Fish Taco
Quesadilla
Can I say it was well worth every penny
And the bottle Cokes from Mexico Too Awesome for words

The 6'4" Father and son working there were Awesome

Even brought our food out to the car after I steppe out to inform my wife of the condition of the place.

Love every bit and We will be back
