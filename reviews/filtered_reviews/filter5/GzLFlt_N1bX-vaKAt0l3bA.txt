Came into Diablos on a Wednesday afternoon , the food was great and the service was great as well . I sat in arianas section , she recommended alot of good stuff . Had the queso fundido and the chicken fajitas , was delicious . There drinks are also delicious , the green door is awesome!  Happy Hour is from 3 to 7 every day and they have all drafts for $5 , I recommend this bar if you are in the area and if you're not make a date out of it and go down there , it's worth it !
