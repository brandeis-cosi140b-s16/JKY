How is this neighborhood classified as "Chinatown" by yelp?  It's in a Walmart parking lot in a place white people like.

Anyways, from what I gather, Viva preceded the Lindo restaurants and Lindo ripped off their model with the bean dip and fideos soup and I've had passable meals at Lindo restaurants through the years, but I far prefer the experience at Viva.  The food seems a bit zestier.  The atmosphere is a little more sophisticated, plus they originated the Americanized Mexican restaurant model that the Lindo group seems to have taken over.  

They do have the same overly cheddar-topped, canned refried beans and sitting in a steamer spanish rice thing as the Lindo's but somehow it seems  better and tastier to me.

Great service.  Fine, affordable foodstuffs, convivial atmosphere.  I'll be back...
