Hatch Chilies... just the thought of them, make my mouth water. No one, and I mean no one does hatch chilies like Arriba Mexican Grill. Every Sunday the haul out the fire roaster and roast chilies all day long. You can buy them $5 a pound. Now, on to the dishes... there are so many, I wont list them. My favorite is the Hatch Chicken Especial. It is just the right mixture of cheese, beef and hatch, served in a mini pyrex with rolled flour tortillas and your choice of rice and beans. Unlike Renee A., I like to go on Sundays because I bypass the seating line, and go straight to the bar. No kids, and a great brunch menu.
