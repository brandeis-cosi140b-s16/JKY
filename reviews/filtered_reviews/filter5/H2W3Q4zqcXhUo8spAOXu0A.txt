Backyard Taco has brought out the worst behavior in me.  The carne asada is to blame! (It's the best in town and I'm hopelessly addicted.) The other day when my wife excused herself from the table where we were enjoying takeout from Backyard Taco to answer the door, I took a big bite of her carne asada burrito.  She came back and looked at me askance but I blamed it on the dog. I think she knew I was lying. (Oh, help me!)  Even worse when my toddler son came up to me and asked for a bite of my taco I told him, "Get lost kid!" It may be a sin, but that carne asada made me do it. Hands down the best tacos and burritos in town.  It'll drive a good man bad!
