We love this place! You can't go wrong if you eat here. Their chips and salsa are excellent and their burritos are so flavorful! I either always get their chorizo breakfast burrito or their chicken chimichanga. The BF usually gets something with carne asada or fish. Their friendly staff, clean establishment, and wonderful food keeps us coming back over and over!
