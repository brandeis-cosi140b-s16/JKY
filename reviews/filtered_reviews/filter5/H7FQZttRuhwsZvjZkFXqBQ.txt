This is, by far, the best Roberto's in the Valley. I've tried several gas station versions of Roberto's and none compare to this one. I am a regular here, at least 2-3 times a week because it's located down Rampart near my place. 

The food here is EXCELLENT. I usually order the chicken burrito combo which comes with rice, beans, and a drink...FOR 5.50 (Best deal EVER) !!! The burrito itself is between .75-1 lb of fresh peeled chicken with peppers and onions (always add queso fresco $0.95). Love it. Probably the closest to homestyle quick mexican you will ever get. Also notable are the rolled tacos and carne asada plate. Truthfully, the prices are what got me in and the taste keeps me coming back. The salsa bar with marinated veggies are totally worth a sixth star.

Service is quick, accurate, and on-point. 

The atmosphere here is more of a "sit-in" style compared to the gas station versions while maintaining a fast food ambiance.

I recommend THIS Roberto's to everyone far and near. Great value, big portions, and gigantic taste...There's no reason to pass this place up.
