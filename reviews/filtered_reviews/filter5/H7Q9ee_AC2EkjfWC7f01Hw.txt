We eat here probably once a week. We have for years now... there is no better Mexican food in the East Valley as far as I'm concerned. It's family-owned establishment, so over the years, we've gotten to know everyone. For us, it's kinda like Cheers (e.g., "Norm!")... and I've noticed that they're like that with all their regulars, so I think that's really cool. That kind of thing is rare...

The food is amazing. The garlic pork roast burrito is the yummiest thing in the world, and since I became a vegetarian, it's the only thing I truly miss in terms of being a carnivore. But they have been keeping me happy even as a vegetarian. The red and green chile are SPICY. like atomic hot, so be careful. It took me a long time to get used to ti, but it's SO good. They also have plenty of non-spicy options if you're not feeling 

The atmosphere and the quality of the food make it worth every visit.
