Wowwww, I thought I was spoiled with Mexican goodness living in the Bay Area. Holy crap, this place exceeded my expectations by a huge amount. Everything, and I mean everything was on point. Some of THE BEST service I had EVER seen in my life and I've done a lot of eating out. Water glass 3/4 full? Get ready for a refill within seconds? Chips almost completely killed? Refill is brought right to your table before you can get the last chip. The staff is very welcoming and friendly as well. Hostesses all greet you with bright smiles and the waiters are very polite. Food was near perfection as well, no complaints at all there. My brother's burrito was literally the size of a football!!! Only thing I have to warn people about, DO NOT plan to eat here if you plan on going out that night. You will be so incredinly full that you will be embarrased to show your 6 pack if you have one. I sure as hell know I nearly needed a food coma and went directly to my hotel room and took a 2 hour recovery nap from my lethargicness. Then I got a call at midnight from the friend who said come down to the casino and I sure as hell did. Interesting night!
