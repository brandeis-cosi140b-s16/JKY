Love this authentic Sonoran  style food!
The owner,  Carmen is a wonderful lady As is her whole family . The food is consistently good.
Love the green chile enchilada style burro  topped with green sauce or red sauce on top. Sometimes I order half green half red sauce on top. Out of this world . The green vegetable tamales topped with green sauce are heaven. The beans are delicious! Love the cinnamon cookie chip they give you with your check! Chips and salsa delicious! 4 stars !!!!
