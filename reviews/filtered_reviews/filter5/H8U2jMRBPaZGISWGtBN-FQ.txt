Went here for the first time today. I have to say, I love low key burger places like this. I see this place all the time driving around but made my first trip inside today, finally! The food was so good, staff was cool as hell, and my kids loved the sweet potato tater tots. Brûlée burger is bomb, I couldn't get enough. Def 5 outta 5 on this and I will be recommending this place to every single person I know!!
