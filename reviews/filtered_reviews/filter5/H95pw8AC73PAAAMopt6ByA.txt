Don't let the seedy location fool ya, this place is the bomb, serving up some of the most authentic Mexican I've ever tasted.

Your experience will begin with parking in the rear of the place. As you make the long walk to the front entrance, you'll disregard any conversation with others in your party as you worry whether or not your car will be there after dinner. It will and here's why.

As you make your way to the front of the parking lot, you'll notice an old Mexican man, (actually a cliche or sorts, complete with sombrero and serape) sitting, vigilantly keeping an eye on your vehicle and everyone else's. 
This should calm you down, enough so that you're able to re-join the conversation. Now get inside and get ready for a cold Mexican beer and a pitcher of Margaritas. 

Their chips are gratis and served warm. A nice treat,. They offer red salsa, hot sauce, and tomatillo green sauce which is spectacularly hot.

Every item on their menu is delicious, but my preference is either the Machaca burrito, or the Chicken Mole. Their mole sauce is off the charts good. Not too much chocolate, not too much chile, just right. 

What I really love is the black and white photos of old Mexican bandits, governors, rabble rousers, war hero, ex-Presidents and others. 

Here's my suggestion.
Go on a weeknight when they're not busy. In this way, you can make your way around the room and get a close up look at the images, which in my opinion are worth a look,.

The food, ambiance, service are all superb. 
This is the place where I take out-of towner's when they say they want 'real' Mexican food. 
This is also the place where your butt-hole will curse you the next day if you don't listen to him and ease up on the salsa.
