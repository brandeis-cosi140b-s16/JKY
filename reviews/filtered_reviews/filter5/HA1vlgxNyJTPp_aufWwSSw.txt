This has become our new favorite restaurant! The first time we came here we had the best tacos ever! Make sure you try the Kobe Steak Taco!! We have been here several times with different waiters, they have all been good with service. We usually ask for Garrett, we think he is newer, he is really polite and never lets my drink run low. I don't know how, but he remembered both my wife and I by name! The chips here are different, but very good!! I wish I had more of a chance at the bean dip, but my wife believes it is her personal dish every time... Garrett recommended the calamari to me, I don't know how they make it, but it is to die for and now we get it every time!! EAT HERE, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.
