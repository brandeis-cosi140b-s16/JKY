Even when this place is packed the service is awesome! My best friend and I went last night, we love this place! Out of everywhere in Arizona this is our fav. We had great food and even better margaritas. We ran into a problem last night with our drinks, they don't have a smoking patio so we went out front and let the server & hostess know we were stepping out for a sec, which they said was no problem. Our server came out five minutes later apologizing because someone bussed our tables, "oh no my margarita!". Never the less he offered us ones on the house, we declined because we were leaving soon but our server took it a step further for us and comp'd our margaritas that were thrown out which was super nice of him! Needless to say this is an establishment that has awesome food, drinks and they take care of there customers!
