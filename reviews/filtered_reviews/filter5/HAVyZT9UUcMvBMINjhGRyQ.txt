This place is amazing. The pastor tacos are out of this world. Like a fiesta in your mouth. I would recommend you trying them with the chipotle salsa  from the salad bar. I enjoyed every last bite I even wanted to lick the plate. The last time I had pastor tacos this good  I was in Mexico City.  This place is very small they have a little bar and it is dark. But when you have pastor tacos this good who needs light anyways;) the salsa bar was impressive I would recommend this place to anyone . I will be back with my mother, sisters, brother, aunt, uncle, Cousins neighbors friend :) AMAZZZINNNNGGG !!
