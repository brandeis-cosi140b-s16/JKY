I went for lunch at Javier's with my family on a Saturday.  We were seated as a group of 6 right away.  Their house chips and salsa which they brought to the table was incredible.  Our server showed up at the correct time to take a drink order, and was promptly there when we were all ready.  The food was great, everything was fresh and my carne asade tacos were great.  The most impressive part of the meal, was our service.  The bussers were always there at the right time to refill chips and salsa and water, and our waiter was there whenever we needed a menu or drink item.  On top of this, the restaurant had a great Mexican design and ambience that pulled us away from the casino feel.  I would highly recommend, and I don't do that often.
