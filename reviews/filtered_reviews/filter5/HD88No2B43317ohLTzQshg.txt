I will always be loyal to the pork salad w/ house dressing, shredded lettuce, black beans. There is truly no reason to order anything else, as this is one of the best meals you could possibly hope for. The line speaks for itself. Again, no words can explain the phenomenon that is this salad, I rest my case. :P
