Of all of the mexican restaurants I have ever visited, Santos Lucha Libre is by far the best food I have ever experienced!

There are plenty of meats to sample before you get started on your main selection. I would highly recommend the 'street tacos'. Yes, street tacos are by far the best selection. In fact it was so good that I wanted to do it all over again. Sure, I have to buy new pants because I ate so much but trust me when I say it is excellent!

The staff is very friendly and the decor will make any person smile, if you like mexican wrestling. This food was prepared with love. Therefore you should give this place a try!
