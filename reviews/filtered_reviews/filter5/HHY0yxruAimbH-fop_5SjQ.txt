First there's that kick-ass logo: a 1950s-inspired sailor tattoo, all come-hither eyes and Betty Page sex appeal. Who couldn't love a place like this?

First there's the inventive drink selections - curious concoctions of wines and hard liquors and champagnes... delicious. But nothing can quite prepare you for the jaw-dropping tacos. Sure, they're pricey and they sound disgusting - if not completely off-putting, but they're amazing. Jalapenos collide with Granny Smith apples and braised duck meat, quail eggs marry themselves with potatoes and chives. Incredible. I think the menu changes seasonally, so it's always a different experience.

But the service? What can I say - a bunch of tattooed hipsters who think they're better than you and would rather slice their eyelids off with razors than talk with patrons. So below them. Disappointing, to say the least.

Update (7/24): Uh, yeah. I had dinner here tonight and I'm adding a star. First of all, our server/bartender, Curtis, was the least pretentious guy in the joint... and handsome/charming to boot. Second of all, dessert was carmelized pineapple and papaya with ginger whipped cream, served with a side of watermelon mint soup. It was the gospel, y'all. And the tacos? Calamari, pork belly, and pork shoulder - all delicious. And the squash appetizing was lick-the-plate terrific. 

You've won me over, Yo Rita. Godammit.
