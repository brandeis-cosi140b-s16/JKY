Best tacos in town in my opinion, the pastor is the best I've had and I usually stay away from pork but the marinade is ridiculous.  The placebos very small and very casual. The owner is super nice and always very professional. Can't say enough about this place but hope the expand soon and get a larger place with a larger parking lot.
