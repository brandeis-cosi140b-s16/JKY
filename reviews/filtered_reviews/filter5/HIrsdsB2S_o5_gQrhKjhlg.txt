I have only been here twice but I'm in love. I've sat both outside and inside. I did prefer inside because of the atmosphere but outside was still fun for people watching. Both times I got the Bistec taco, it is amazing. I'm a pretty picky person and I didn't change anything about this. The food is so fresh and smells amazing. I wish there was more food to an order (2 tacos per order) but that's only because of how good it is. I do get full from the 2 tacos because they are pretty loaded up so wanting more is just me being greedy :) I am not able to drink tequila but I still wanted  a Margarita and the staff was super nice and accommodating about which ones would be best to replace with vodka. The staff is amazing, everyone I've experienced so far has been really friendly! I can't wait to go back and try the guacamole menu and some different tacos!
