The wife and I went to Border Grill a few days ago with a Restaurant.com $25 gift certificate.

The restaurant was pleasant and the servers very welcoming and friendly.

We ordered plantain and black bean empanadas to share for an appetizer. These were really delicious, you could really taste the plantains. I could sit on my sofa at home and eat thirty of these things.

For the main course, I ordered the Carnitas which were tasty, though I would have preferred them in Tacos. I know I was taking a little risk ordering differently from usual. The carnitas came with some small, fluffy tortillas and a variety of fixin's - pico de gallo (which was a little sour), a slaw of some sort, guacamole, and a little salad of chopped red onion and cilantro. Overall it was very good, though I'd probably order more in line with my usual preferences next time.

My wife had the Mushroom Mulita which she enjoyed very much, although I'll let her go into that in greater detail when she writes her own review.

We had enjoyed our experience here so much that we were tempted into dessert. Something I really like about Border Grill is they let you get half slices of two of the dessert options for $9 as an alternative to a whole slice of one of them for $8. This lets you try two different things.  We went with the Flourless Chocolate Truffle Cake - absolutely melt-in-your-mouth incredible, and the Pastel Rufina, a sort of cream cheese cake in puff pastry and topped with profiterole-like objects. This came accompanied with an attractively arranged display of fresh berries. The Pastel Rufina, even for a half slice, was enormous and we couldn't finish the thing between the two of us. I'd hate to have to finish off a full sized slice!

While Border Grill is a little on the expensive side, the restaurant.com coupon really brings it down into the realms of casual affordability. The food here is prepared with a deft hand and is really delicious. I can't wait to try the lunch options!
