I don't throw out 5 stars for a restaurant very often but this place is absolutely the bomb.  The el pastor blows me away.   Even the lengua (which normally grosses me out) was tasty and prepared just right.   Tacos El Gordo ain't cheap and it's no where near my house but the drive is worth it.   It's greasy, unhealthy, gut-bomb good.  I can't wait to go back again.
