Love the concept, great interior, great service. These guys are starting out here but they've already been doing great with Soho over at Jones. Love the flavors and how we can customize our sushi burrito with any filling. Price is what you'd expect for some great ingredients. The freshness on that first bite is what will hook you to come back for another. Really happy that we have a joint like this in the valley. Will be back soon !
