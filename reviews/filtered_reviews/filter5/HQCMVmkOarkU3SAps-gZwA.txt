Great food and great service. Very warm feeling environment. Everyone that's employed there is very kind and they have great customer service skills. Taco Tuesday is a must with a waitress by the name of kimmie! She's great. We always go back to visit her! Their drinks there at the bar are great too. We've never had a bad drink or bad plate of food!
