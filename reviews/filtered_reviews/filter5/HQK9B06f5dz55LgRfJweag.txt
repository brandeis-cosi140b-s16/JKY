The food was FANTASTIC...the manager(Brandon)was very welcoming and and I have never seen a manager more attentive and on top of EVERYTHING going on in the restaurant. Our server(Kayla) was darling...and she had wonderful suggestions on what to eat(like the pomegranate guacamole...omg it's to die for)

Food=10, Service=10, Decor=10...it doesn't get any better than this!!!

We can't wait to go back again!!
