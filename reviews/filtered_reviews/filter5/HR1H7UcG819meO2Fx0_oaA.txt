I am not sure who labeled Dick's Tex-Mex, they are WAY off.  It is New Mexican for sure, and AMAZING for certain things and ok for others and not so great for some things.

The atmosphere is fun, quirky and all Dick's!  Wood floors, cozy tables, cool wood bar, fully testosterone driven decor with some Kokopellis  and Coyotes thrown in for good measure.  Dark, smokey (the good kind wafting up from the smoker and the hot hardwood coals on the grill), comfortable and casual.  John Wayne would have felt quite at home here. The wait staff has always been awesome.  In the 12-15 year that I have been going to Dick's I have only had one bad experience with a member of the waitstaff, luckily they are gone now.

The food is great in very specific areas, like the Carne Adovada, Blue Corn Smoked Turkey Enchiladas and Posole which are exceptional.  Smokey, spicy, tender and savory.  Sunday brunch with a plate of Carne Adovada and an over easy egg will make your entire year!  The quesadilla is solid, the hamburger is wonderful, the grilled shrimp and smoked foods rock!  When they stick to the New Mexican cuisine the food is heartwarmingly great.  When they stray... sometimes it works and most of the time it doesn't.  I usually steer away from the fish specials which usually are over breaded, over cooked, over sauced and unfortunate when it is all said and done. I also stay away from the salads which are over worked and heavy.

The wine and beer selection are unexpectedly good for a neighborhood bar setting, but I usually go for the Prickly Pear Margarita!  Needless to say I weigh just under 200 lbs at 6 foot and two are sufficient to make me slur my words a touch, well, more than a touch (even with a full belly of Carne Adovada).  But it I enjoy every minute of the food, atmosphere, drinks and camaraderie at Dick's Hideaway!
