The reason this restaurant gets 5 stars is because of the good food to price ratio.  You pay about $8-10 per plate and it is very delicious.   Everything looks and tastes homemade and they tell me they don't use any lard.  I could not expect any better at this price point.  The tacos and the beans are delicious along with the tomato onion, and pepper salsa that they bring out with the chips and salsa.  I have had better taco's but for much more money.  I have never had better beans.  

Congratulations on a good food for a good price.
