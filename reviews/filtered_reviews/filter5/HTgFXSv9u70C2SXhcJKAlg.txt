i literally eat the roof off of this joint.

My girlfriend introduced me to Chino about 2 years ago. Since then i have probably eaten here about 20 times. My go to plate is jade red chicken, pork fried rice, black refried beans, and a machaca quesadilla (when i am feeling crazy i also order a pollo diablo burro).

Somedays the food portions are larger than others and some days the food is better than others. I ate here last night and i was the best it has ever been resulting in a classic 5 star yelp review (shocked i haven't reviewed it already considering i'm addicted to chino).

I have eaten at both locations but prefer the 19th ave location. The thing you gotta love about this place is how crazy it gets in there. You've got a crazy menu to order from, and a hilarious open area of plastic tables and chairs filled with people not really sure of whats going on. Theres kids running around climbing all over a giant panda while everyone is dying to hear their name called out so they can feast on a crazy mexican chinese infused plate of heaven.

If you have never been don't be shy and get a few free samples from the sample area to the left of the register. I still have not tried everything on the menu but will venture off my standard go to plate one day.

5 stars for sure and i love this place after a hard Sunday of tailgating/drinking at the Cardinals game.
