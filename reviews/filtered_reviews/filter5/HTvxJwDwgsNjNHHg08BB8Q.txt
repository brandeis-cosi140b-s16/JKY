I almost missed out on the deliciousness this place has to offer - my teen didn't want to have Mexican food. I lucked out since there aren't many places open before 3PM in Old Town Scottsdale during the week and this was one of the few restaurants open at 1:30 PM. We started with the papas on the appetizer menu, at the recommendation of our server, we mixed the corn and pork - WOW!!! 

I had the 3 tacos for $10. You can mix your selections. I picked the grilled pescado, pork chili rellano and the barrio pollo. All were very good. The pork with the chili was a pleasant surprise as it was SPICY!!! I love spicy food and this did not disappoint but I was told that it is just the luck of the draw, because it all depends on the jalape√±o they put on the taco. If you like spicy though, I highly recommend trying your luck.

My six year old ordered the hot dog off the kids menu, it came with choice of a side. She chose the rice and kept raving about it (this child doesn't like anything). 

The server was great. Yvette was very welcoming. I highly recommend this place.
