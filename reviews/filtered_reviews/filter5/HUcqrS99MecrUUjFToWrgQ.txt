Located on the scenic grounds of The Fairmont Resort is as far as I go because FOOD. 
Table side guac: 
5 stars 
Queso chorizo fundido served with fresh made tortillas: 5 stars
Entr√©e/ the house fav. steak enchiladas: 
unofficiated 5 stars 
- was too full to feel my face or taste..or move. Our server told us the menu selection is seasonal but the steak enchiladas are forever. They're that popular. Too bad I let gluttony take the wheel during phase one.. that fundido though! No regrets. 
Hacienda serves up some of the best damn Mexican food in the valley: fact.
