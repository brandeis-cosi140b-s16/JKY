I love Nando's! I'm lucky enough to live about a block away, so we eat here often. It is very clean, fast service, excellent food. It's a bit pricier than some competitors (only $3-4), but it's well worth it for the quality and portion size - the combo plates are HUGE; you can probably split a plate dinner with a friend!  Chips and salsa are complimentary of course.  The salsa is above average and the chips are hot and fresh. I haven't tried their margaritas yet, so can't comment on those.
We do 'carry-out' often as well, and they don't cheat on the portion size like some restaurants do when you don't eat-in.  They always give a HUGE bag of chips with every carry-out meal, but I would order the extra pint of salsa - the small container of salsa they give you goes quick!
