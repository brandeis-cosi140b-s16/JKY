Yum! Came here for a team outing and everything was delish! The portions are HUGE and the prices are great! I went there with 6 other people and our total bill, including two appetizers and beverages, was $123 including a 20% gratuity for a large group. I've been wanting to go here for a while and regret I didn't come sooner. There's a smaller one closer to my house so I'll definitely plan to go there in the very near future.
