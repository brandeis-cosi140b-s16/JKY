Wonderful Champaign Restaurant.  We went with a group of 9, and it was delightful.  The wait staff was attentive, but not over crowding; the guac was absolutely delicious and the portion was very large.  I had a Spanish rioja, which made me very happy as well, libation wise.

For dinner I had the phyllo and chevre wrapped lamb; the lamb was a little more cooked than I wanted with a medium rare order, but it was still delicious; the chevre/rosemary/phyllo was an awesome, melt in your mouth combination.  Veggies were good, mashes potatoes were awesome as well.

Overall, I really liked Escobar; great food, we had great company, and a wonderful celebration to finishing theses :)  Definitely a Champaign gem!
