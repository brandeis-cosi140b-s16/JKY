We were thrilled when we found that one of our favorite Vegas restaurants opened a second location in the Forum Shops. And the Hot Tamales did not fail to impress. The green tomatillo salsa was better than I remembered, even more addictive. The oysters were a briny slap in the face (and that's a compliment from a Bostonian...) and served with different granita toppings. The appetizer trio was solid; our previous favorite - the plantain empanadas - were off, but the rest were delicious. Our entrees were a shrimp relleno taco and the rib eye. The taco were incredibly complex with chili, huge shrimp and a topping of pickled vegetables. The rib eye was perfectly cooked and served with a delicious chimichurri. The star of the evening though was a side of roasted beets served over a carrot pur√©e.  The mixture of beets each had individual flavor, a pleasant char and seasoned with cumin and lime (we think). 

Our server, Matthew, was fantastic. The restaurant was slammed after we arrived and he and the rest of the team hustled. He brought us out sorbets at the end of the meal - the mango was to die for.
