I was pleasantly surprised when I finally had a chance to have a Jaburrito. I expected it to just be a giant sushi roll but it's more because you can customize it with some alternative ingredients and, maybe more importantly, texture. I had a nori jaburrito with Salmon and Avocado (my favorite simple roll), masago, wasabi mayo and avocado cilantro, lettuce, tortilla strips, and tomato. What sets these rolls apart is mainly going to be the sauces. They add another layer of flavor choices that really makes it enjoyable. I also had a side of seaweed salad, which was pleasant.

My jaburrito was 7.95, which I thought was a good price for fresh fish and great tasting ingredients. Other choices can run as much as 10.95, but I honestly think it's better to choose a favorite protein and make your own rather than jumble 3 or more fish together.

I've also tasted the Jachos with taro chips, which were also tasty, but I don't really know how well it went with fish. I'd think drenching it in sauces and masago and veggies would be the way to go, but I'd have to experiment with that more.
