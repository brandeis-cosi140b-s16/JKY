Oh if only the girlfriend ate meat, this would be the place for us.  As such her review is two star, and mine is five, and never the twain shall meat.  I mean meet.

This place has an old school charm and feel.  Dimly lit, fireplace, cozy, and tons of tasty meat.  I had a spicy pork roast and glass of malbac that I can confidently claim was my favorite meal of the week in PHX.

Its not cheap, but its certainly not a bad value either.  This is a classy place that I wish I could use for special occasions - if only they did a little more chicken.  Nobody's perfect, but for me, this place is as close as it gets.
