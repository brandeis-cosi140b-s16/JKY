OH YEAH! OH YEAH! OH YEAH!  *does happy dance*

I think I may have found my new favorite taco joint. Even better when it's located on my side of the town. Used to go to Tacos El Gordo when it was behind the Encore, still followed them even when we had to go to the ghetto side of town, but lately TEG has been a clusterfukk everytime I go. Anyways....that's beside the point.

At about $2.25 per street tacos, I usually order about 2-3. My go-to tacos are always carne asada and al pastor. The meats are prepared fresh and juicy You order first and then you pay. Don't know what's so confusing about that. Street tacos menu are posted in big letters. Just read what's above and get in the corresponding line to order you tacos....it's not THAT hard, folks. -__-

You can also order chips on the side. From what I've seen, they got a great beer/alcohol selection as well as your staple Horchata and soft drinks. Besides tacos, you can get a bowl, fries, or burritos.

They got a pretty good extensive salsa bar. Try all kinds of salsas to your hearts content. I can imagine this is a pretty busy spot especially on weekend nights.
