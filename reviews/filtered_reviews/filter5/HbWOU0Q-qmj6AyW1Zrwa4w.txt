Excellent tex mex food and drinks!  My friends and I have gone for dinner but truly their happy hour is THE BEST in town!  The chambord margaritas are to die for!! We also eat the smoked chicken enchiladas and the delicious  catfish beignet appetizers! The beignets are very light battered catfish "fingers" that are served with a southwestern romoulade sauce ( kinda chipotle flavored). The staff are always warm and friendly and take care to serve you promptly.  Definitely a MUST DO dinng experience.
