This was our first time at Mi Casa.  The restaurant is just beautiful!  The chips and salsa were great as the salsa had a lot of flavor.  I ordered the shredded beef enchiladas and will tell you that they are some of the best that I've had!  I will definitely return to this restaurant for the good food.  Service was a little slow, but was not bad in any way.  We enjoyed our time here very much.
