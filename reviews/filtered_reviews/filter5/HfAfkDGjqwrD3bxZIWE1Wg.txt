Tia Rosa's has the best Chicken Nachos I've ever eaten. You've got to try the nachos if you visit Tia's. They are good with Chicken or Beef, and are one of the best values I've come across at only $9 for a huge plate that 2 can share.

If I were a famous serial killer on death row, and I was offered my last meal, it would be Tia Rosa's chicken nachos.
