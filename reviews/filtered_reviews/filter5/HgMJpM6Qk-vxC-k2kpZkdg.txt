I'm from Chicago where the make the best burritos in the country.  I've looked everywhere for a decent "fast" Mexican restaurant and Roberto's is it.  I only go to the one on Fort Apache & Charleston, but I'm sure they're all equally as good.  I've even left the burrito section and ventured into the combo plates, which are just as good!
