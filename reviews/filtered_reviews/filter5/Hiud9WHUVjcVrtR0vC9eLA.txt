ALMOST felt like I was eating my grandmothers cooking it was so delicious! Everything on the menu sounded so good I wanted one of everything!!! But I didn't I got their barbacoa and ting they were full of flavor, cooked perfectly and exceptional customer service. My mouth is watering writing this review, I can't wait to go back and eat some more! BEST TACOS IN AZ!!!!
