Freakin' awesome!  I've been here about 5 times and am finally getting around to writing a review. Sorry, Tortas el Guero, and sorry to the viewing public for the delay. I've tried several of the tortas and have NEVER left disappointed. The bread is fresh, the toppings on the tortas are amazingly flavorful, and the salsa options are delicious. And the owners are awesome people who always prepare your food with a smile. Check it out!  Don't wait another minute.
