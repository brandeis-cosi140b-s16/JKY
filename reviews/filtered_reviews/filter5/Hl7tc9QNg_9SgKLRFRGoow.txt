We ate here about a month ago. I'm writing about Leticia's now because their service and food was unforgettable!  Let me tell you this place pays a lot of attention to detail. The glasses were chilled, tortillas warm, and our waitress was so friendly.  It was the small perks of eating here that went a long way. We came here on our cheat day and I wanted to give up my diet for good after eating here. I would recommend this place to everyone!
