Overall, this was a fantastic experience, and I want to go again whenever I am back in town.

We had a three-course meal, and every course was fantastic. I had a watermelon basil mojito, and it was just sweet enough for my tastes and was smooth and delicious. 

The first course was a pork belly lettuce wrap. I liked the crispiness of the pork belly and how you get an overall nice flavor. 

We next had a kale salad. I loved this salad. It had a great dressing with a kick to it. I am not sure what all went into it, though I will have it when I make it back to The Mission.

For our final course, we had three different types of tacos. The beef tacos were delicious. The chicken tacos were very tender. I think the pork tacos were likely my favorite -- they were juicy and tender. I was surprised by how tiny the tortillas were -- that wasn't a negative, just unexpected.
