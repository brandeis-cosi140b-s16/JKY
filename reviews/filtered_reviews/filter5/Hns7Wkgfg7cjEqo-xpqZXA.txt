This place is truly a hidden gem. It's a semi spotty area surrounded by some industrial buildings but inside is clean. 

The food is AMAZING and the staff is always really friendly and fast. The carnitas tacos are unreal - the meat is crispy and charred on the edges and they put a very generous amount of meat in their tacos. The prices are super fair especially considering the quality and amount of food they give you.

There's a drive-thru as well, but I prefer to go inside and utilize the fresh salsa bar.
