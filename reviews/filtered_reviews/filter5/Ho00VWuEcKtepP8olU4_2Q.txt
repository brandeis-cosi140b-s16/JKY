This was my first time eating here after Ive seen a suggested post about it on Facebook I decided to try it out. I work graveyard so ordered to go so I can eat it at home before I head off to work. 

I ordered the pick 3 combo I decided to pick 2 stuffed ground beef sopaipillas and 1 rolled chicken enchilada with green sauce on all of it. The food is amazing this was my first time trying sopaipillas the meat is very tender I would definitely order this again without a question. The chicken enchilada was very good most places have a tough time keeping the chicken moist and not dying it out but they nailed it. All in all I will Order from them again.
