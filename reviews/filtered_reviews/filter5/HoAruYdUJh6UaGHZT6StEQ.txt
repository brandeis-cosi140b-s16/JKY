We ate there 2 days and yummy..we got the ceviche sampler and it was delicious. The first time we ate at the bar and our bartender was really great. He made drink suggestions and food suggestions. He was awesome. I feel bad that I dind't get his name! SEcond time we ate lunch and it was very delicious. The prices aren't bad considering the athmosphere/ Fun little thing is that they have a really cool photo booth in there for after you have a few drinks!
