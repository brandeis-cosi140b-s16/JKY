I must admit to being a total food show geek so always take the opportunity to go to restaurants featured on one of them.  I saw these two ladies on Top Chef Masters and again on Chef Wanted so when looking for a Mexican place to eat in Las Vegas we jumped at the chance.  Needless to say by my five stars we were not disappointed.  First let me say if you like tequila, the bar has almost every kind imaginable as well as flights that you can purchase.  I opted for a shot of Casa Noble which is one of the best sipping tequilas ever.  Of course when they brought chips and salsa, both really fresh and tasty they asked if we wanted guacamole and of course we said yes.  One of the best I've had lately.  You could tell it was just made and was very traditional in that there were mashed avocados with big chunks, a bit of onion and some peppers.  I could have made that my dinner.

Instead hubby had the carnitas which of course I tasted and they were amazing but I thought my fish tacos were even better.  You could get grilled or  batter fried and they use mahi.  the plate came with three mini tortillas with the fish and slaw as well as refried black beans and two colors of rice.  

Sadly enough we didn't have room for dessert but since we go to Las Vegas three or four times a year, you can bet that we'll be going back to Border Grill.
