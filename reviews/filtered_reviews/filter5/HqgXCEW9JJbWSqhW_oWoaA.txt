Wow- what a fabulous authentic cuisine we had last night. While visiting the Phoenix and Scottsdale area we happened to get a recommendation for this restaurant.
When we pulled up around back (in the parking lot) we were welcomed with a wall of beautiful murals- the colors were so vivid and the art work was so alive.
Our group started off with some fresh made guacamole- and I mean fresh. The waiter came out with a cart, sliced and diced and prepared it at our table. I ordered the sangria. It came out in a huge glass- didn't have to order a second. Thought it was a little tart but the sugar around the rim was a nice touch to sweeten the pallet.
For dinner, of course I had to ask our waiter for his opinion between a couple of dishes. He immediately said the: Cochinita Pibil and so that's what I got. It's a 12 hour slow roasted pork served with grilled veggies, tortillas, and Yucateca. The portion side of pork was amazing. I even surprised myself by finishing it all- but it was that good. 
Unfortunately, there was no room for desert. 
I will make this place my local stop when visiting in the future.
