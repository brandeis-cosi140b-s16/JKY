My wife and I make this place a habit. Never once in our 10+ visits have we experienced any of the negative things mentioned in lesser reviews. 
We are willing to drive from Gilbert to Shea and the 101 to eat/drink at a restaurant where we know that the Chefs, business partners and servers put real passion into what they do. 
There are not many restaurants where, on a Sunday afternoon you see a head chef in the trenches not just making amazing food but also bussing tables alongside his business partner. 
We make the hike up to paradise valley every week for bomb nachos/tacos/dessert, awesome drinks and hospitable service from Victoria, Riley, Payton, Dave and the entire crew. These guys kill it and if you haven't tried it, try it, you won't regret it.
