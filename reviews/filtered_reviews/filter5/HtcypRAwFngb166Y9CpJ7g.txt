AMAZING food!  I'm a huge fan of New Mexican style food having lived in southern New Mexico for 10 years.  Si Se√±or has captured the flavors (and heat) I love so much.  The prices are very reasonable and the entree sizes are generous.  My favorite is the red or green chile Enchilada Plate (with an over-easy fried egg on top)!  The Hatch green chile is very hot but has so much flavor it's definitely worth a little pain.  The margaritas are very good and the servers are nice and attentive.  They even finish off every entree with a fresh hot fluffy sopaipilla!  I'm definitely hooked (or maybe addicted?)!
