It was a perfect romantic dinner by the fireside.  Our waiter was very professional and knowledgeable about the menu and had excellent recommendations, the outdoor courtyard table right in front of the fireplace was as romantic as it gets, and the entire atmosphere was dreamy.  The food did not disappoint neither.  We had the pork belly to start with- cooked perfectly tender with avocado mousse and spicy mustard on the side- the boyfriend even said it was better than his entr√©e!  

I had the pork shoulder as main and the boyfriend had the flank steak.  The pork shoulder was charred and crispy on the edge and tender on the inside, every bite was heaven, paired with a very good Merlot.  The flank steak was very good, according to the boyfriend, as well.  We were too full to get dessert but I heard good things about the chocolate churro.

Although pricy, but definitely worth a visit.
