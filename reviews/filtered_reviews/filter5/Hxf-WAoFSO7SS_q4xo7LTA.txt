Great dinner at the MGM! It usually takes us some time to pick out a place to eat in Vegas, and this was no exception.  

When we went in the decor and the hostess seemed very friendly.  We got seated and the server was quick to come by and introduce himself.  He recommended some drinks and we got the table-side guacamole to start with.  

The food was incredible!  From the complimentary chips and salsa they bring to the desert!  They serve three different salsas and three different seasoning salts that you can use with the chips or your tacos.  We ordered tacos and were not disappointed.  By far the best taco's I've had.  The flavors were very intense and did not need any sort of additional supplement!  In addition, the table side guac is a must! 

Definitely looking forward to this place next time we're back in Vegas.
