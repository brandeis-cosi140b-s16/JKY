The food is beautifully prepared & sooo delicious! The atmosphere is relaxing & very classy! I had the pork shoulder which was AMAZING!!! Our daughter had the steak tacos & they too were fabulous! My husband had the iron flank steak which was incredible! The cocktails were perfect! We also had the table side guacamole which is a definite must try!! Super delicious!! This is by far one of my new favorite restaurants in Scottsdale!
