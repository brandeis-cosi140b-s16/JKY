I was tipped off about this place by a co-worker.  We made a last minute decision to eat dinner here, instead of the Vig on Easter Sunday night.  So glad we did!  The food was awesome.  The Skewers were great and the BBQ flatbread pizza was huge.  

We drove around a bit for fear of parking in a spot that wasn't the Hideaway's...but when we got inside there is a sign that says you can park ANYWHERE in the lot and not get towed.  Just an FYI.

I thought the two guys that were tag-team bartending/serving were very attentive.  And I'm a server so my standards are kind high.
