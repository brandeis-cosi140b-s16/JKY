This place is bar none one of the classiest, most delicious Mexican food spots I've ever been to. Food is awesome and the atmosphere is high class without the expensive price tag. Jose makes the best house margaritas made with fresh lime and pineapple juice,  agave and tanteo jalape√±o infused teguila. Best margi I've had in awhile. Definitely recommend you go. You will be a regular.
