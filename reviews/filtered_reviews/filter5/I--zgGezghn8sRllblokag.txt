Yo! Do yourself a favor and eat here asap! 

Food is fresh and delicious. The drinks are great too! Fresh fish, chicken, steak, and plenty of vegan options. 

I have been here twice and both times was blown away. The sushi is so fresh  and tasty you cannot go wrong. Make sure you taste all the sauces and mix and match. 

Also the taro chips were beyond great. They are homemade. Chef Lee has definitely taken his recipe for success from SOHO Sushi and applied it to JaBurritos. 

Enjoy your meal!

**Just added to menu is the Kodiak. It's 10/10 amazing!!!
