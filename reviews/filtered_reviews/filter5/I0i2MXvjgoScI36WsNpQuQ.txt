Leticias has become my favorite Mexican restaurant. Everything I've had has been excellent. The burritos are the best anywhere, and are huge. And I highly recommend trying the QuesoTaco. 

The staff is very friendly and are very helpful when you have questions. My family will definitely make this place a regular visit!
