I am kicking myself for not trying this place sooner. I found it thanks to a Yelp search. The moment I walked in I felt like I was in downtown Rocky Point. Everyone has pretty much covered the complimentary Chips & Salsa but they can't describe how delicious the Green one was. It was not like anything I have ever had. It has a taste of creamy avocados and was perfect with the Chips but also was perfect on the fried fish I had. I sliced some of the fish and put it in a freshly made flour tortilla and spooned some of the Green sauce on it and was in heaven. I ordered the fried (breaded) Fish & Shrimp. The shrimp needed no sauce at all. The breading was perfectly seasoned and the shrimp were some of the largest and tastiest I have had. There was way to much food for even a hearty eater. Don't let the location scare you it is perfectly safe and the place is warm and inviting inside. My only regret is I was to full to eat some of the yummy looking deserts in the case. I am going to make room for them next time if I have to split a plate with someone but in any case I will be back.
