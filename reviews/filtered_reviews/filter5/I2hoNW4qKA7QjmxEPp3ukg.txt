My family eats at Nandos all of the time. The food is always served hot, tastes great, and you get plenty of it. You will not go home hungry. The costs are reasonable. Great bartenders. The have some of the best chips and salsa. Watch out for the hot salsa,they are not kidding when they tell you it is hot. The severs are always very friendly and accommodating.
