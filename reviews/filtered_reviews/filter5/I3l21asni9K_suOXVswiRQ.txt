My new favorite burger! I've been lucky enough to sample a few menu items:

Brûlée burger: juicy burger with melted havarti cheese, the best pickled red onions, a sugar brûlée'd bun, and a perfectly cooked egg with a runny yolk on top. This one is my favorite, but it is rich. 

Fries: delicious. Totally worth it. Try them with their "ranch" (I have no idea what's in it but it's also quite super)

Country Fried burger: had this on my birthday, I had been waiting to try it. It was really tasty, 2 "country fried" patties, cheese, tomato, gravy, and crispy fried onions. This burger is also super tasty, but not at all what I was expecting. The patties weren't as crunchy as I expected, but it was still really good. 

Paradise burger: my husband ordered this one but shared a few bites with me. The chile and pico packs a punch if you're sensitive to spice, if you're not sensitive it is packed with flavor and the pico adds some nice freshness. Would definitely do business with this burger again. 

French toast fries: perfectly crunchy and sweet, served with syrup for dipping. 

Lucky Charms Shake: shut up and take my money. It's awesome, and definitely not TOO sweet, which I was worried about. 

Overall, this is my favorite go to burger spot in the valley. It's affordable, laid back, and delicious. If they served alcohol I probably wouldn't ever leave.
