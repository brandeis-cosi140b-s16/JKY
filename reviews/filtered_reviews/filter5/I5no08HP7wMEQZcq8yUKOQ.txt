This is by far one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. 

The restaurant wasn't that full since it was between lunch and supper. The service was beyond expectations, the server knew every dish with al Ts crossed and all Is dotted. It was perfect. 

The food was, also, perfect. I had a Sarape de Pollo, my parents shared the stuffed pepper with steak. We had the queso fundido and fried calamari for appetizers, ah! So many good flavors!


Unfortunately, we were all too full to dare into dessert. It was a great experience at Mundo, nevertheless.
