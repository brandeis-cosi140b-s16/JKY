I miss many things about my former life in Los Angeles. Wahoo's is one of them. Very glad to see that there is a location near my home.

This location is quite good. Clean, for the most part. I don't suggest walking into the bar section if you have asthma or sensitivity to cigarette smoke. It's a bit strong, but the restaurant side makes up for it. They also have beer.

I typically will get fish tacos, but the nice thing about this place is that there is something for everyone, particularly if you have friends who don't eat meat. 

Get the black beans and brown rice if you want to be healthier-ish.

Also, they have a fantastic happy hour!

I can't wait to come back!
