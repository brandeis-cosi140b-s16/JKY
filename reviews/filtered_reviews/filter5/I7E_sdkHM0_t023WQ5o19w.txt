For what this place is, [a cheap, tasty land of burritos (and some other mexican food)] It's gotta get five stars from me. I love it! My roomates eat there like 4 times a week, no joke! 
It's quality.
A little greasy, which is why i don't eat there as much as them. But, if you want good, fast mexican style food. You have to try this place.
