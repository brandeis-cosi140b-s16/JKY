Amazing menu and it's all 24/7!!!

Don't let the location fool you, in fact embrace it. Plenty of parking or valet service! Chef Paco has put together an incredible, authentic menu that he and the staff serves 24/7. Non GMO and organic ingredients are standard, many GF options and the chef will make modifications for vegans (mmm...churros). It's a true hidden Vegas gem. The decor is great and the staff is super friendly, and be sure to check their web site or Facebook page for all of the great specials they offer though out the week. Chances are if you stop here once, you'll find yourself becoming a regular.

The private room is great for groups, I had a dinner for 40 and it was a great time!
