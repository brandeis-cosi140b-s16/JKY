Fuzzy's is such a fun place with yummy food. I had always just come here to drink since they have huge beeritas/beergaritas but one day I decided to try their food and it is actually really scrumptious. The workers are always so pleasant and funny, I feel like such a regular now. Their tacos, enchiladas, and tamales are great! Also their mex-mex rice and beans are delicious. It is a great location on Mill and when you're done eating you can walk upstairs to Vintage or across the street to the Vine, Rula Bula, or Moonshine. Parking is usually pretty easy to fine on the meters between Fuzzy's and Caffe Boa.

Also they have a reward system that gives you points every time you visit, it's the Fuzzy's app, check it out
